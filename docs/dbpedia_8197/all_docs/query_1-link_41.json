Laura Katherine Werner was born August 3, 1993, and died unexpectedly on July 14, 2024, at the age of 30 due to her lifelong battle with epilepsy.\n\nRaised in Wexford Village on the west side of Madison by her loving parents David ‘Mark’ and Kathleen, Laura attended Glenn Stephens Elementary and graduated from Memorial High School in 2011. In high school, Laura played soccer, explored photography, and built lasting relationships with not only her peers but those younger than her and especially those older than her. Ultimately, Laura’s love of the elderly led her to pursue social work degrees in higher education. Known as an ‘old soul,’ Laura will be amply remembered for her impactful professional contributions in social work with the elderly.\n\nTo Laura, acts of caring were second nature. Laura’s path to caregiving began early as a babysitter who cultivated kindness and laughter. Laura’s nickname, ‘Lola,’ is a funny reminder of her time working with young children whose ‘r’s and ‘l’s were indistinguishable from one another. To her favorite trio of troublemakers, she was ‘Wa Wa’ Werner -- the most dependable person in the world next to their parents. As Laura matured, she sought the opportunity to broaden her skills. Industrious and hard-working, Laura’s path toward social work took its first footing at Oakwood Retirement Home where her position as a dietary aide quickly distinguished her as someone ready to play an integral role in the daily lives of the residents. Although difficult work, Laura especially thrived in making connections with her memory care patients.\n\nAfter earning her undergraduate degree in social work from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, Laura worked as a Care Manager for some of our neediest brothers and sisters in the city of Milwaukee, WI. Inspired to return to her love of working with the elderly and making a greater impact in the quality of their lives, Laura returned to school and served as an intern at Ovation Chai Point. Laura earned a Masters Degree in social work from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and went on to serve her community at the city’s Lutheran Home, Milwaukee Catholic Home, as well as HarborChase of Shorewood. Laura ultimately returned to Ovation where she will be profoundly missed.\n\nLaura loved parties, ball games, and holidays because it meant that friends and family would be together. With her hands in the air, Laura was usually the first on the dance floor but the last to leave a conversation unfinished. Raised a Badger girl and an avid Brewer fan, Laura relished being a part of the crowd. Unapologetically true to herself and her convictions, though, Laura sported Chicago navy blue and burnt orange on football days because that was her beloved papa’s team.\n\nLaura is preceded in death by her paternal grandparents, Frank and Evada Werner; and maternal grandparents, Bill and Helen Menke, and her beloved yellow lab, ‘Yakers’. Laura is survived by her cat that she called ‘Chicken’; her proud parents: Mark and Kathy Werner; her loving sister Caroline Grace; and her adoring brother Patrick John. She is further survived by her loving “second mom” Aunt Sara Menke; Uncle Dave Menke; Uncle Steve and Aunt Heather Menke; Aunt Pam Mack; Aunt Janelle and Uncle Fred Robinson; Cousins: Yvonne (Jocelyn) Hertich, Nicole Robinson, Tanya (Joe) Blosser, Tyler Mack, Rita, Jack, Zoe, and Piper Menke. And all who knew and loved her.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family suggest making a donation to the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) of Dane County.\n\nFollowing the funeral mass at St. Thomas Aquinas, family and friends will gather at the Great Dane at Hilldale from 12:00p.m. to 3:00p.m. for a continued time of celebrating Laura's life and legacy.\n\nCress Funeral & Cremation Service\n\n3610 Speedway Road, Madison\n\n(608) 238-3434"
