        "text": "Types of DNA Tests at our Lincoln, Nebraska locations:\n\nThe most commonly ordered DNA test is a Paternity Test to conclusively establish whether or not a man is the biological father of a child.\n\nPaternity Testing can be performed at our testing centers. DNA Testing can be done for other close family relationships, such as:\n\nSpecimens we can test for DNA\n\nThe easiest and most reliable way to obtain a DNA sample for paternity testing is to swab the inner cheeks of the people being tested. These skin cells are known as buccal cells, and they rub off easily onto cotton swabs and remain in place for analysis by our laboratory. Other specimen samples, such as hair follicles, fingernails, and garments that might contain someone's DNA, can also be tested. An Alternative Specimen DNA Test is done by registering online and shipping the specimens to us.\n\nLegally Admissible DNA Tests vs. \"Peace of Mind\" At-Home Tests\n\nA Legal Paternity Test is a court admissible DNA testing service. Accurate results for DNA paternity testing with 99.99% confidence or greater take about a week.\n\nWhen deciding which type of DNA test is right for you, consider first what you might do with the results. In order for the results of a DNA test to hold up in court, for child support, or to change the name on a birth certificate, the test must be done at a clinic using strict chain of custody procedures. Our Lincoln DNA testing technicians are trained to follow guidelines that ensure that the results can be used for legal purposes.\n\nHow to schedule a DNA Test in Lincoln NE\n\nScheduling a DNA test at one of our Lincoln clinics is simple and fast, and we often have appointments available in the same week. It's always helpful to schedule in advance to make sure you get the time you want. Register online, or please call our customer service team, which can help you book your appointment over the phone."
