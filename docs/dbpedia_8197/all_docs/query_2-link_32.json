        "text": "About me\n\nBorn: Whangarei, New Zealand on the 20th of September 1995\n\nNationality: New Zealand and Dutch\n\nLanguages: English, Dutch & German\n\nI was first introduced to this wonderful and crazy planet in 1995, born in New Zealand during a seven year circumnavigation of my parents. My love for the ocean was instant and only grew over time. Having lived in a house for only one year of my life, the ocean naturally feels like my home. When I was 6 years old my parents divorced and I decided to stay with my dad who had started building a 70ft Norwegian Fishing cutter on his own - from scratch. I helped him often and got inspired to build my first little sailing raft at age 6 - from then on I was hooked. Soon I was racing my own Optimist and later a Mirror on the Dutch rivers where we were living. By the time I was 10 I had managed to convince a friend of my father to let me fix and use his old Hurley 700 (a 7 meter seaworthy sailboat). The following summer I sailed this boat solo around Holland and the Wadden Islands for seven weeks. I loved to sail alone, well almost alone… my dog Spot was with me wherever I went, whether it was on the water or on land :) Since the age of 8 I had done various jobs like cleaning shops, street-performing on a unicycle, delivering newspapers - and saving every cent so I could eventually buy my own yacht. This happened at age 11 - I bought my own Hurley 700 and then spend all my free time maintaining and sailing this boat. By the time I was 13, I sailed alone to England."
