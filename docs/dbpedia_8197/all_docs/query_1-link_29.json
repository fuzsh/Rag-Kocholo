        "text": "Laura Branigan, singer and songwriter, was born in the upstate New York town of Brewster. After high school, Laura moved to Manhattan and attended The American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In the late 70’s, she toured Europe as a backing vocalist for Leonard Cohen. Upon Laura’s return to New York, it became clear to her that she wanted to pursue a career as a solo artist. Laura’s powerful talent as well as her drive and determination led to her being signed to a multi-album deal by Atlantic Records founder and legend, Ahmet Ertegun. Ertegun was extremely fond of Laura and often spoke of her as one of his \"greatest finds\".\n\n“I first heard Laura Branigan sing live in my brother Nesuhi’s apartment, where we had gone because he had a very good piano. I immediately realized that she had a great pop voice, in the classical sense. Laura had an instinctive feel for music and melody, and her delivery was sensational. Everybody at Atlantic knew that we had a winner in this young lady, and she came through with great hits that will be remembered for many years to come. I consider Laura to be one of my best signings, and I am proud to have had such a great singer in my career in the record business. We miss her dearly.”\n\n- Ahmet Ertegun, 2005 (quote provided exclusively to Other Half Entertainment)\n\nIn 1983, Laura released Branigan 2 (Gold) and had two more Top 10 hits with “Solitaire” and “How Am I Supposed To Live Without You”, confirming her status as a major artist, with the latter track reaching the #1 position on the adult contemporary charts. That same year, Laura could also be heard on the Flashdance soundtrack with “Imagination”. Her musical involvement with the film led her to receive her second Grammy nomination.\n\nLaura released Laura Branigan in 1990. With this album, she added producing to her repertoire with her cover of the disco-era \"Turn The Beat Around.\" Laura's seventh studio album, Over My Heart, was released in 1993. This recording was by far her most personally reflective to date. In 1995, a US greatest hits collection called The Best of Branigan was released. This hits compilation included two new cover tracks, \"Show Me Heaven\" and \"Dim All The Lights.\"\n\nLaura's US album and single sales have exceeded ten million, with her multiple international greatest hits compilations having sold additional millions in every world market. These cumulative sales have garnered Laura various Gold and Platinum record awards from both the RIAA in the US and similar entities in other countries. She performed for audiences in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, and Africa, touring the world several times with consistently sold-out shows to her credit. In reference to performing live, she said, “When you're on stage, the audience becomes your other half. It's the ultimate high you can reach as a musician -- an incredible feeling. And no matter where I am it's the same; there's a reason we call music the universal language.”\n\nIn the mid 90's Laura took a hiatus from her career and devoted her time to caring for her husband, who was diagnosed with cancer, until his death. During the late 90’s while dealing with her loss, Laura performed only the occasional concert. In early 2001 she made her return to the studio. 2002 saw the release of The Essentials, a digitally remastered hits compilation. During 2002, Laura also performed the role of the singing Janis Joplin in the hit New York City musical \"Love, Janis.\"\n\nClick the picture to see a larger view\n\n2004 saw the release of Self Control 2004 and Gloria 2004, collections of remixes of the original Branigan classics produced by some of Europe's top re-mixers, which feature stunning, newly-recorded vocals by Laura. During this time Laura was at work performing concerts at various venues, as well as continuing to record her album of new material, and it was with great expectation and anticipation that fans everywhere were awaiting its release. Laura was back touching audiences once again with the unique four-octave range voice, consuming passion, and undeniable power that is pure Branigan! Sadly, Laura passed away suddenly on August 26, 2004 from a brain aneurysm. At the time of her passing, Laura was working on the production of an EP, a manuscript for a cookbook she was in the process of writing, and the opening of her official online store.\n\nThe years since her passing have seen the release of the 2006 UK greatest hits compilation, The Platinum Collection and the 2007 repackaging of Laura's US hits compilation, The Best Of Branigan, as part of Warner Music's \"Greatest Hits\" series. In 2008, Laura's albums Touch, Laura Branigan, and Over My Heart were reissued. History was made in 2010 when Warner Music Gallo Africa released Shine On: The Ultimate Collection\" on CD+DVD, with the groundbreaking inclusion of Laura's Atlantic music videos on DVD for the first time ever!\n\nThe distinctiveness of Laura's voice is undeniably recognized as being hers and hers alone. Her range coupled with the incredible but precisely controlled power of her voice simply blows the listener away. Laura said that she wanted to stand on her voice alone - for her, it was always about the \"big\" voice, the power, and the emotion in every note. The way she delivered a lyric was always very genuine, very real. To listen to Laura's interpretation of a song is to become immersed with her in its emotion. She expressed, \"I want to touch people's hearts, to get right down to their souls.\"\n\nLaura lives on through her music and through the wonderful memories of her family, friends, and fans worldwide. She sought to make a personal connection with her fans and she greatly succeeded in that endeavor, touching lives in very meaningful ways, making each and every one feel as if she were singing just for them. Laura's fans are found in every country and they remain a very devoted group even years after her passing, who are dedicated to do what they can to ensure that she is never forgotten. It's with great excitement that there is a new generation of fans coming into the fold, many as teenagers and young adults, who are eager to get hold of her albums and to learn all they can about her artistry and life."
