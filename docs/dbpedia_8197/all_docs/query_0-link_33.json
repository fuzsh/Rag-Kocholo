        "text": "Obituary\n\nLaura Mae (Rose) Brown was born December 8, 1947, to the union of Ella Louise Rose and Joe C. Rose, Sr. in Jackson (Utica), Mississippi.\n\nAfter her parents separated, she moved to Lincoln, Nebraska with her mom and brother Joe, Jr. While residing in Lincoln, at an early age, she became a member of Mt. Zion Baptist Church under the leadership of Reverend Stringer. In the early 1960's, she, her mom, and brother Joe moved to Omaha, Nebraska. She began her 9th grade year at Technical High School and met Robert Lee Brown, a senior. Laura moved back to Chicago to spend time with her father but her and Robert remained committed to one another during that time. She went on to finish her high school career in Chicago, IL at DuSable High School and returned to Omaha, Nebraska while Robert moved onto the Navy. Recognizing the importance of her relationship with Christ, she joined Salem Baptist Church under the leadership of Reverend J.C. Wade, Sr. After Robert returned from the Navy, he and Laura married on June 11, 1967, at Salem. To that union were born 3 children, JoAnn, Tina and Robert, Jr.\n\nLaura was a woman of class and grace. She was a very loving and kindhearted person; to know her was to love her. She possessed a wisdom that gave her the ability to lovingly tell you about your situation in a way that would make you think about your choices and not feel judged. She was able to calm you while in a distressed state and help you see the bigger picture, that God is and always will be in control regardless of what we see with our natural eyes.\n\nHer passion as a long-time advocate and educator of children was reflected throughout her life. She began her career at HeadStart and later moved on to open her own childcare facility named Brown's Castle. While Brown's Castle was a great success, she chose to align with Omaha Public Schools and remained employed with OPS for nearly 40 years until her retirement in 2020.\n\nAs an active, long-time member of Salem Baptist Church, Laura was instrumental in working with the youth, specifically in Sunday School and Vacation Bible School. She also participated in the Youth Choir and advanced later to the Salem Inspirational Choir.\n\nLaura was very creative and a great organizer. She regularly assisted in planning and coordinating weddings for Salem members and others who sought her skilled services.\n\nLaura was preceded in death by her parents John and Ella Louise Hill, Sr.; father Joe C. Rose, Sr; brother Anthony C. Hill; sister Antoinette C. Hill; brother James Hill; granddaughter Robin Loray Brown; nephew Cornelius Hillard III; and niece Alicia Prince.\n\nLaura leaves to cherish her memory, husband Robert Lee Brown, Sr. ; Brother Joe C. Rose, Sr. (Jackie) of Lakeland, FL; Sister Annette Hillard (Cornelius) of Opelousas, LA; Brother John Hill, Jr of Omaha, NE; Cousin/Sister Brenda Smith of Atlanta, GA; daughter JoAnn Gosa of Baker, LA; daughter Tina Brown of Omaha, NE; son Robert L.
