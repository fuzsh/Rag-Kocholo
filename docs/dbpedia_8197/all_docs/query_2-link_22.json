        "text": "I'm glad you're here! From the age of 7 or 8, I had an idea that one day I'd travel the world, meet my sisters and brothers, and share the message of love. Which is why, first and foremost, I consider myself an \"Ambassador of Love.\" As a child, I'd walk miles around my town singing Love is in the Air, not much has changed! What I didn't know, was that life would present me with a series of challenges, preparing me to fulfill on this mission, including losing all my hair, at age 11, to a condition called Alopecia Areata. This experience helped teach me that our biggest challenges can become our biggest blessings! It taught me a ton about empathy, compassion and love for my self and others. Then an even bigger challenge occurred, when I was in a car accident with my best friend, and gained an angel. The gift this presented is that I now know, even when our loved ones are no longer physically with us, we remain connected. Donna reminds me to always \"Keep Shining!\" I have awesome angel stories. If you've got an autographed book, you know that's how I sign each and every one of them.\n\nYou can order books, inquire about school visits and speaking opportunities, find out what events I'll be at next, and follow my adventures on my blog. Scroll down to purchase books, or head to the purchase page.\n\nHope to HUG YOU soon! Till then...\n\nKeep Shining!\n\nLaura\n\nI'm a big fan of the trend of asking guests to bring books to baby showers to start the child's library instead of a card. I'm grateful I Love You More has become a favorite for welcoming new babies into the world.\n\nHere you'll find what inspired me to become a children's author, as well as more about my books. The New York Times Bestseller, I Love You More that's reached millions of hearts, homes, and classrooms around the world and is available in eight languages! We are now celebrating my books collectively selling over ONE MILLION COPIES!\n\nI'll Hug You More, is a perfect companion to I Love You More. A host of animals share times throughout the day you will hug your children and they will hug you, expressing your love and appreciation for one another! The spirit of Wayne Dyer had a bit to do with the writing of this one at 3:33 AM! Before passing on he generously endorsed my books and programs. I've always been a big fan of hugs and they're proving the power of connection is one of the surest ways to foster self-worth, create a sense of belonging, and keep us happy and healthy--embrace that!\n\nI'm thrilled to announce the arrival of my newest book No Matter What, You Are Loved, in the works now. This message is a big piece of my heart, and powerfully shared from the voice of the children-- empowering them to rise, shine and lead with LOVE! I believe together with illustrator Trevor Romain, and a brilliant designer, we are creating something super special! Stay tuned!\n\nYou Are a Gift to the World/ The World is a Gift to You, is temporarily out of print, but available with your child's name in the book through Put Me In the Story, and BIG NEWS -- we are working to have this back in print, possibly by the end of 2024! For NOW -- sign up for my newsletter and receive it as a PDF to use on your phone, tablet, computer - my gift to YOU!"
