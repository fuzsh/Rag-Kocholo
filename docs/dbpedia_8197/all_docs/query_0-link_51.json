Thinking about you and your family.\n\n– Mindy (Lemon) Marsh\n\nI remember how my mom worked overtime to ensure I had everything I needed, and somehow still managed to make it to every one of my games. She gave me the space and permission to be who I wanted to be, and supported my decisions even when they meant that I would be leaving Lincoln to pursue basketball. She never made me feel guilty for choosing to leave home, only encouraged me to get out and experience the world. She was an incredible mother and friend, and I’m proud to be her daughter. I love you and will miss you, Mama Bear! Love, Missy\n\n– Missy Schomaker\n\nI worked with Linda and the last few years we worked side by side. We shared our ups and downs and we laughed until the tears rolled down. We lost contact over the years but I read she had health issues and I regret not reaching out then. She is an amazing person and a good friend. She truly has a place in my heart. Rest in peace Linda and watch over us!\n\n– Jolene Bloebaum\n\nMy wife and I were daycare for the Shoemaker family. Great family all round. I’ll always remember the look on Missy’s face the night that Linda and Frank danced on our patio. Leona loved the whole family!\n\n– GARY ELSBERRY\n\nGrandma Linda – every time we see a big red N or a $2 bill, we will think of you. Thank you for letting us win at Rumikub (sometimes). We promise to take good care of Shoe.\n\n– Love – Nate & Macy (& Shane)\n\nLinda was a great friend, and also a good neighbor!! She would get the Husker football tickets for us to go to the game and I would take her out to dinner and our choice together was always Olive Garden. Linda and I also joined Weight Watchers together, and after a few weeks of meetings, we decided to enjoy our after-meetings at Village Inn, having biscuits and gravy !!! She was just a lot of fun and so easy to talk to. Rest in peace Linda Lu!\n\n– Barbara huston\n\nObituaries & Services\n\nSearch for:\n\nMemorial Services\n\nJanice “Jan” L.
