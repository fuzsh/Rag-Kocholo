        "text": "Laura Allie Johnston, the daughter of Elza Lemont and Mabel Gertrude (Scott) Boswell, was born June 8, 1930, in Adams County Iowa. Laura entered eternal rest Thursday, December 19, 2019, at the Clarinda Regional Health Center, Clarinda, Iowa, at the age of eighty-nine years.\n\nLaura attended grade school at the Washington Township #5, “Boswell” Country School and graduated from Corning High School with the Class of 1948. She was united in marriage to Warren Morton Johnston on October 4, 1949 at the Mt. Etna Methodist Church. Three children were born to bless this union: Lois, Linda, and Wayne. The family moved to their farm in 1952.\n\nLaura taught school for a short time, then raised her children and helped Warren with all tasks on the farm. She helped with the field work and made meals for all the hay hands. They all loved to come back for her meals. Laura kept a large garden and had an especially large strawberry patch. As the years went on the garden got smaller. She raised chickens, picking them in the early morning to be done by noon and doing 60 each day till done. Laura was an extremely good cook. She made pies for her church and the church sales. She could make very, very good rhubarb and peach pies which would sell for over $100.00 at the church auctions. Laura was a good seamstress and sewed all her girl’s clothes when they were small. Laura loved to quilt and visit with the ladies at two churches where she quilted. Laura’s family meant everything to her. She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.\n\nLaura was a member of the Corning United Methodist Church and the Mary Martha Circle. Laura moved to Clarinda in September of 2018.\n\nLeft to cherish Laura’s memory are her children: Lois Elaine Davison, Clarinda, Iowa; Linda Marie (Scott) Walsh, Lincoln, Nebraska; Wayne Dean (Donna) Johnston, St. James, Missouri; grandchildren: Andy (Justine) Davison, Clarinda, Iowa; Karla Davison, Clarinda, Iowa; Josh Johnston, St. James, Missouri; three great-grandchildren: Tyson Johnston; Owen and Drake Davison; and one on the way; sister: Alice (John) Burchard, Omaha, Nebraska; sisters-in-law: Bobbie Boswell, Corning, Iowa; Blonde Boswell, Fontanelle, Iowa; many other relatives and friends.\n\nPreceding Laura in death were her parents; father-in-law and mother-in-law: Clarence and Ethel Johnston; husband; son-in-law: Dan Davison; sister: Berniece Huntington; three brothers: Albert, Orval, and Clarence Boswell; sister-in-law: Tootsie Boswell."
