        "text": "Laura Rhodes\n\nPublished 5:08 pm Wednesday, August 7, 2024\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nNovember 4, 1953 – July 8, 2024\n\nLaura Rhodes joyfully moved from earth to her home Heaven on July 8, 2024, surrounded by her loving family.\n\nLaura was born in Fort Worth, Texas on November 4th, 1953. A few months she moved to a small town in France, with her parents Clarence and Rose Skinner. Her father’s military career provided an adventurous and interesting life for Laura. Her parents often choose to live off of the military bases, and this provided rich cultural experiences in France (as a young child and later again as a pre-teen), England, Japan, and Okinawa, and vacation trips to Rome, Brussels and Switzerland.\n\nLaura attended Kubasaki High School in Okinawa and completed her senior year at Plattsmouth High School in Nebraska, graduating in 1971.\n\nIn 1972, while attending Oral Roberts University, a handsome young man named James Rhodes, asked if he could sit next to Laura, and a life-long love story began! They married in 1974 and Laura graduated from ORU in 1976, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Health & Physical Education. Upon graduation she was offered a teaching job as a graduate assistant at ORU. She eagerly accepted and began teaching classes full-time. James and Laura enjoyed a love that never faded and only grew more meaningful with each passing year and they were married for almost 48 years.\n\nLaura often said that “motherhood was her highest calling and greatest joy” and in 1979, she and James welcomed their first child, Rebecca and their second child, Caleb, in 1983. They lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma until 1985 and enjoyed raising their family and being involved with Victory Christian Center.\n\nAfter moving to Johns Creek, Georgia in 1987, Laura began participating in Bible Studies at church. Her last bible study lasted over 38 years and provided lifelong friendships. Laura enjoyed volunteer/fundraising work with the local junior league for child abuse programs and other community programs. Her fundraising efforts caught the attention of the now named Atlanta Homes & Lifestyles magazine and Laura was offered a job in 1990. It was an exciting, fun, glamourous job, but Laura’s love of being a full-time Mom won-out!\n\nAs her children grew, Laura enjoyed being involved in all aspects of their lives, cheering them on at sports events, band events, school events, church activities, and hobbies. She was grateful that she and her husband always stayed close to their children and that they had raised them to love God.\n\nAs her children entered the college years, Laura enjoyed supporting her husband in his construction/design firm. In 2007, she and a co-worker, created an art licensing company, Velvet Lime Designs, that created inspirational, whimsical artwork for manufacturers. The company flourished until its closing in 2017 and provided a creative outlet that Laura enjoyed.\n\nIn recent years, Laura has poured her faith into all those around her, sharing her beliefs and values with neighbors, friends, and family. Her heartfelt conversations and acts of kindness have inspired others, strengthening their own faith and sense of purpose. Laura leaves a rich legacy of love and faith to her family who she celebrated every day.\n\nShe is survived by her mother, Rose Skinner; a daughter and her husband, Rebecca and Nick Ladikos; a son and his wife, Caleb and Kelsey Rhodes; 4 grandchildren; Sophia Rhodes, Lilly Rhodes, Alexa Ladikos, and Noah Rhodes; a brother and his wife Bud and Laura Belle Skinner; a brother and his wife Mark and Christine Skinner; mother-in-law, Mary-Anne Cornwall Rhodes sister-in law, Suzanne Feske; sister-in-in law and her husband, Sarah-Lynne and Robert McLaughlin; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nLaura was a woman who loved deeply and her legacy of faith in God will continue through her children, grandchildren, family, and friends.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to two wonderful ministries:\n\nLighthouse Family Retreat\n\nhttps://www.lighthousefamilyretreat.org/\n\nKeystone Village\n\nhttps://keystonevillage.org/\n\nREAD MORE OBITUARIES HERE."
