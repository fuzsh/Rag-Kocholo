        "text": "No matter how you call this American singer, Laura Pergolizzi, Laura Pergolizzi, or as she calls herself, LP (LP), once you see her on stage, hear her voice, you will talk about her with aspiration and delight!\n\nIn recent years, the singer has been very popular, and this is not surprising. The owner of a chic mezzo-soprano, who takes the stage with a guitar, ukulele or harmonica, she writes heartfelt songs that captivate with purity and bubbling energy.\n\nChildhood and youth Laura Pergolizzi\n\nLP is a rather mysterious person. Even biographical data taken from different sources sometimes contradict each other.\n\nStarting from the year of birth and the time of graduation from school to the beginning of active creative activity, collaboration with famous musicians and the release of solo albums.\n\nThey say that people born under the sign of Pisces are creative natures. Laura, born March 18, 1981 (according to other sources - 1968), is a perfect example of this. Her homeland is the USA, Long Island.\n\nThe combination of Neapolitan, Sicilian and Irish blood gave the girl a bright, expressive appearance, emotionality and passion.\n\nGrowing up in a family far from pop and show business, Laura was still a favorite child - her interest in creativity was supported, her passion for music was encouraged.\n\nShe inherited a strong and deep voice from her mother, who loved to sing and always inspired her. Already in childhood, Laura herself mastered the harmonica and ukulele.\n\nThe years of study spent at the school. Walt Whitman High School, ended happily in 1996 (or 1986).\n\nA decisive step had to be taken. The fact that her vocation is music, the girl had no doubt. The case could be hindered by a heavy loss - the death of a beloved mother.\n\nBut thanks to the support of her father, she coped with this blow and found the strength to go to the goal without turning or stopping.\n\nFirst LP steps on stage\n\nThe beginning of her musical career was marked by the appearance of this famous pseudonym - LP, which is, in fact, the initials of the singer.\n\nIn New York, where she moved after leaving her home, the first professional connections appeared.\n\nHer partner in creativity and stage was Alicia Goldsberg, the beginning of cooperation with which dates back to 1991, and the moment of creation of their duo Lionfish, whose name is a combination of their zodiac constellations (Leo and Pisces), is 1995.\n\nOf course, the team could not do without a rhythm section - a drummer and a bassist. They were Andy and Jeff. After European and American tours, the group replenished with friends who also studied at the Berklee School of Music.\n\nThis enriched sound instantly conquered New York. Offers of cooperation poured in one after another. In particular, the group has worked with such \"sharks of show business and sound recording\" as K. Street, M. Gazaaski, P. Clifford and others.\n\nAnd thanks to the participation of LP in the recording of the Gentelman's Blues album by D. Lowery's Cracker, Lionfish's demo disc called Trinket, their first album, Too Much Love, was sold out by the \"fans\" in the early days.\n\nLP - solo\n\nIn 2001, Laura began her solo career. The popularity of her debut album Heart - Shaped Scar, produced by David Lowery, is hard to describe.\n\nOne of the songs was included in the soundtrack of the drama Eternal Treasures. 3 years later, LP released Suburban Sprawl & Alcohol, which featured Linda Perry, an American rock singer from 4 Non Blondes. And she won again.\n\nBut the proposed collaboration with Jam Records soon had to be abandoned. LP did not change its image, as the producers demanded, and remained true to itself.\n\nTherefore, now the “fans”, as before, see a black-haired, curly-haired miracle on stage, dressed in a men's suit, sparkling with a white-toothed smile and mischievous brown eyes pouring out from under sunglasses.\n\nThe postulate “Everything that does not kill us makes us stronger” is 100% true for Laura. She continued to create. Her works were performed by Cher, Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis.\n\nIn 2010, in Los Angeles, she co-wrote the song Cheers (Drinkto That) with Rihanna, which was released on November 12, 2010 along with the album Loud. In addition, she collaborated with The Veronicas, Backstreet Boys and other famous artists.\n\n2012 brought the singer a lot of achievements: the first woman elected Martin Guitar Ambassador, \"Performer of the Week\" by Vogue magazine, \"Music Event of the Year\", \"Rising Star\" by Esquire magazine.\n\n2014 - the release of the new album Forever for Now, heartfelt and sensual, brings her world fame. 2015 - recording of the fourth album, release of the single Muddy Waters, which became mega-popular.\n\n2016 - release of the album Lost on You, performance with its title song at the Coca Cola Summer Festival 2016 in Rome and shooting a video clip. France, Poland, Belgium and Israel lift the composition to the top of their charts.\n\nLaura Pergolizzi now\n\nToday, the active nature of LP has a place to turn around: the New Wave 2017 festival, recording new albums, touring tours, including in Russia. In the spring of 2020, she will perform at the best venues in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nOn March 14, 2021, the singer presented the clip One Last Time to fans of her work. The video was directed by Stephen Schofield. The main role went to the charming Jamie King."
