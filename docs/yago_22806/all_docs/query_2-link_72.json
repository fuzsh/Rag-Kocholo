        "text": "Born. To Cliff Robertson, 43, Hollywood hero, best known as J.F.K.’s look-alike in PT 109, and Dina Merrill, 42, sometime actress and daughter of Marjorie Merriweather Post: their first child, a daughter; in Manhattan.\n\nMarried. Mimi Baez, 23, younger sister of Folk Queen Joan Baez, currently acting with “The Committee,” a San Francisco theater group; and Mylan Melvin, 25, producer for Mercury Records; both for the second time (her first husband, Novelist Richard Farina, was killed in 1965); in Big Sur, Calif.\n\nMarried. Leon Uris, 44, lion of the bestseller lists (Exodus, Topaz)’, and Marjorie Edwards, 25, jewelry designer from Philadelphia; he for the second time (he divorced his wife of 21 years in 1966); in Hollywood.\n\nDied. Major General Keith L. Ware, 52, commander of the U.S. First Infantry Division in Viet Nam (see THE WORLD).\n\nDied. General Rene Cogny, 64, commander of French troops in North Viet Nam during the fall of Dienbienphu in 1954; in the crash of an Air France Caravelle jetliner that took 94 other lives; in the Mediterranean, near Nice. Known to his men as Le General Vitesse (General Hurry-Up), Cogny protested angrily when superiors ordered him to hold a defensive position at Dienbienphu, which fell to the Communists after an eight-week siege. Equally bitter was the political settlement reached at the Geneva Conference shortly thereafter. Said the general: “Too many deaths, too many deaths for nothing.”\n\nDied. Tommy Armour, 72, golf’s battling Scot, who won all the big tournaments in the 1920s and early ’30s; after a long illness; in Larchmont, N.Y. Gassed at Ypres in World War I, Tommy was strong enough by 1920 to win the French Amateur, in 1921 moved to the U.S., where he turned pro and swept his era’s top tournaments—the Canadian Open (1927, ’30, ’34), the U.S. Open (1927), the P.G.A. (1930) and the British Open (1931, ’34).\n\nDied. Hans Christian Adamson, 78, author, aviator and, with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, survivor of a famed World War II ordeal at sea; of a coronary occlusion; in San Francisco. Off course and low on fuel, a Flying Fortress with Adamson, Rickenbacker and six others aboard was forced to ditch in heavy Pacific seas. The airmen drifted on rubber rafts for 23 days before being rescued—an experience that led Adamson to write a number of books on sea survival and a biography of the World War I flying ace whose courage he had observed at first hand."
