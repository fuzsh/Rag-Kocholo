        "text": "I first visited East Hampton in the early 1980s with a girlfriend, singer actress Christine Andreas, from NYC. I was living and working part time in a loft in SoHo at the corner of Broadway and Broome St,Â working for artist John Alexander when I met Christine. Christine was in the original Broadway cast of Oklahoma and could sing as well as anyone on the planet, seriously! She was giving a performance that summer of âSongs by Sondheimâ at Guild Hall of East Hampton and asked if I wanted to come out and stay with her while she practiced. Wondering where we would stay I asked and she said with her friend Dina Merrill. Iâd never heard of Dina but I recognized her husband Cliff Robertson. We took the Long Island Railroad from Penn Station and arrived after dark in East Hampton. Dinaâs driver picked us up. The only thing I noticed was a sleepy town with tree lined streets. The next morning we woke up by the beach in a different world, a hundred miles away from the noise and pollution of Manhattan. We spent several long weeks at their home, my introduction to The East End, a place far different than a kid from Texas would have imagined. I remember getting up early that first morning and going into the dinning room by myself. The table was set on a fine tablecloth, you could help yourself to was juice and coffee, a bowl of fresh fruit, several place settings with a medium sized plate on a larger plate, six or eight knives, forks and spoons, glasses, a napkin all perfectly arranged and two neatly folded news papers. I sat down wondering what to do. Then a minute later a very polite lady from the kitchen came to the table and asked what I’d like for breakfast. I think I chose something simple like bacon and eggs. One morning there were three other guests at the table and someone asked Christine how she warms up for a performance. Christine demonstrated by singing, softly at first going thru the scales for a minute or two. It was one of the most beautiful sounds I’d ever heard, like a songbird welcoming the morning sun in the Garden of Eden. Dina’s house wasn’t what you’d expect either, certainly not by today’s standards but beautiful in every way, tucked into the dunes and surrounded by low trees and plantings so that it didn’t appear to stand out. It wasn’t a large house. The guest rooms were small, there was a living room and a small library. It was meant to be a beach house and our hostess showed it was OK to walk on the carpet with sand on your feet. What caught my attention more than anything thoughÂ was Dina’s scrapbook on a table in the library.\n\nAs a child Dina, with her parentsÂ Wall Street tycoon E. F. Hutton and his wife, cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, sailed around the world on their yacht, the Sea Cloud. She had saved all the newspaper clippings from their ports of call, usually from the front page of the local papers from all over the world. The leather-bound collection, with a picture of the Sea Cloud on the cover was 3-4″ thick and half the size of a sheet of newsprint. I was fascinated and began to realize who Dina Merrill was. We had lunch at the Maidstone Club, we were invited for cocktails at the Gardinerâs estate, to a concierto by the legendary Carlos Montoya and Christineâs performance was outstanding. Wherever we went heads would turn when we walked in with Dina.\n\nI’m not positive today as I think back but one person who stopped by Dina’s while I was there was her friend Roger Lacy Stevens, very stately looking and a gentleman. Mr. Stevens was the Chairman of the board for the Kennedy Center. This is a sketch I made after we met which would have been around that time."
