        "text": "She had the life. Just being rich, looking gorgeous, and gong to high class functions every night.\n\nIf I could trade places with anyone (and live in their prime) it might be her.\n\nSaw her in a Madison Avenue hair salon about 3 years ago. She was in bad shape--severely stopped over and shuffling along But she's still so rich she could afford a white nurse/home health care attendant who was with her. Think she lives in River House.\n\nShe's wonderful in Just Tell Me What You Want as Alan King's alcoholic wife, Connie.\n\nShe had a weird Hollywood career--she was stunningly beautiful and not untalented, but she mostly just played the rich bitch all the time, which is what she was in real life. It must have been fun for her to break the role on Batman as a cowgirl supervillain.\n\nYes, R16. They had a daughter who died a few years ago of cancer. She had a son who died in a boating accident in his early 20s. Her niece, whom she raised as her own, was murdered by a boyfriend about two years ago.\n\nR15, \"rich\" describes her. \"Bitch\" does not.\n\nI love the fact that she took the last name of Merrill from Merrill Lynch because she knew it would rankle her stepfather - E.F. Hutton.\n\nShe had more money than God being from those two lineages.\n\nHis last name is Rumbough, R31, so he's sharing it with siblings, parents, aunts/uncles/cousins. But Rumbough (his grandfather) is also rich as hell. The kid can afford to dress like that and be a singer. He can afford any damn thing he wants.\n\n[His last name is Rumbough, [R31], so he's sharing it with siblings, parents, aunts/uncles/cousins. But Rumbough (his grandfather) is also rich as hell. The kid can afford to dress like that and be a singer. He can afford any damn thing he wants. ]\n\nI think it's nice that his socially prominent and old wealth family has not cut him off for being a fairy.\n\nOP: Dina Merrill is not the poor man's Grace Kelly or the poor man's anyone else for that matter. While in the late '50s, she was intentionally marketed as the new Grace Kelly. She was stunning, cool, classy and wealthy beyond words. She probably worked when she wanted. After all, she was the only child of POST Cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and Wall Street stockbroker E.F. Hutton. Dina's cousin was Woolworth heiress, Barbara Hutton. Quite the family.\n\nDina appeared in 22 motion pictures, and in April 2005, she received a lifetime achievement award from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\nIn the 1950s, Coty launched an upscale cosmetics line under her name. It was at a time when Coty was losing its status in upscale retailers and becoming more mass market. Revlon (which was also sold at Saks Fifth Avenue) countered by creating Princess Marcella Borghese, and Max Factor developed a premium line called Geminesse.\n\n\"But she's still so rich she could afford a white nurse/home health care attendant who was with her. \"\n\nTime to get an insurance policy, R11.\n\nDina was excellent in A Wedding (1978) directed by Robert Altman.\n\nR11 she lives in one of those 60s/70s era buildings by the UN. 860 I think.\n\nThe family hates her latest husband.\n\nAnother intersting factoid: all the grandkids went to public school. Granted it was Greenwich High School, but still most people I know who live in Greenwich who come from far less either attended or sent their children to either GA or Country Day.\n\nGiven who they are they aren't pretentious.\n\nI don't think she inherited that much of her parents' money. I think she's talked about this in interviews. I mean she very wealthy, but not Madonna or Streisand wealthy.\n\nDina could buy and sell both Madonna and Streisand. Marjorie Merriweather Post was said to have divided her estate equally between her 3 daughters. Dina and her current husband bought a movie studio and she lives in the Hamptons. She is very generous to the museum that her mother founded and has a lot of thing on loan there. If you haven't been to Hillwood Estate, Museum and Gardens then you owe it to yourself. Streisand would salivate over the collection and envy the jewels especially the emeralds.\n\nR62 well, she IS a Republican. Of the old school Eastern Establishment variety, not the crazy kind - nonetheless, I would think that would be enough for certain DLers to tar and feather her.\n\nOf course, these past few years, she hasn't known what's flying, so it's a bit moot anyway.\n\nShe definitely has some sort of dementia. But I'm not sure it is Alzheimer's. She also shakes, so maybe she has Lewy Body Dementia or something along those lines.\n\nAlso, the studio she and her husband bought - that's considered a big joke.\n\nNo, Dina is not as wealthy as Madonna or Streisand, who are both estimated to be worth around $600 million. Post left most of her fortune to charities, including her impressive real estate properties. Dina never had ownership of her mother's big properties, and has stated such in interviews.\n\nShe has Alzheimer's. That's a fact. And she and her husband didn't buy the studio - SHE bought it. For him. The reason it's a joke is because he is a joke. An idiotic blowhard. No one knows what she sees in him. At the time they married and for many years after, she could have had any man she wanted. This buffoon is completely unworthy of her. Yes, her family hates him. And it's well deserved.\n\nShe was wonderful in \"Operation Petticoat.\" Most people don't realize that the film was based on a true story. We really did have a pink submarine in the Pacific at the beginning of World War II. That was due to a mixup in the red-lead rust-proofing undercoat. It was supposed to be hidden by the usualy Navy gray paint but the war began before they got the gray paint. The hilarious letter that Cary Grant sent to a supply officer back in the States when they couldn't get toilet paper, is actually in Navy archives.\n\n[quote] Met her randomly in Vail late '80s and she was charm personified.\n\n\"If you shoved a silver spoon up a monkey's butt, they'd learn how to say please and thanks, too.\"\n\nr65....funny, all souces say Merrill was worth 5 BILLION when she died.....so much for your fangurl facts.....she could buy both Babs and Madonna and have plenty left over to buy Beyonce and Celine as well.....and still be grossly rich."
