        "text": "That famous fur coat in Butterfield 8 (the one that Elizabeth Taylor steals from a swanky Upper East Side closet) belonged to the frustrated Park Avenue wife played to perfection by Dina Merrill.\n\nIf Merrill, who passed away today at the age of 93, was so convincing as that character, it was a role she came by naturally. Unlike the hardscrabble past of many actors, hers was a strikingly different back story: Born Nedenia Marjorie Hutton, she was the daughter of Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and Wall Street stockbroker Edward Francis Hutton.\n\nMerrill enjoyed a childhood of almost unimaginable privilege. She summered on the Sea Cloud, her family’s sumptuous yacht; she wintered at the family’s Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago. (Oh, if those walls could talk!)\n\nWhen she decided to pursue acting, she didn’t ask her parents for any money. Instead, she took $10 an hour modeling jobs (including for Vogue.) Though she was over 30 by the time she got her first role, Merrill had a long and varied career—at one point starring with Cary Grant in Operation Petticoat. (Among that actor’s many wives was Merrill’s cousin, Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton.)\n\nBut she didn’t always play the moneyed ice princess: cast against type, Merrill appeared with her second husband, Cliff Robertson, on the TV show Batman, as the villainous Calamity Jan. And in 1979, she even deigned to set sail on the Love Boat, a vessel far from the Sea Cloud, but just as American, and just as iconic."
