        "text": "DUST buildup will have become a regular source of frustration for millions of people thanks to the pandemic, which has emphasised staying at home wherever possible for months on end. How do you keep your home dust-free?\n\nBy Liam Doyle, News Reporter\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nLynsey Queen of Clean shares recipe for fabric refresher spray\n\nDust and dirt is a problem most people associate with absence or negligence. However, the opposite is also true, as increased activity in one area can stir patches lying all over the home. With most people shut away at home for their jobs, some will spend more than eight extra hours at home per day, meaning they need to redouble efforts to keep everything clean and tidy.\n\nHow can you keep your home dust-free?\n\nDirt can come from many sources, meaning people must stay vigilant to hold it back.\n\nMatthew Harrison and Edward Jonkler of PriceYourJob and Remora Cleaning LTD offered Express.co.uk advice on keeping everything clean.\n\nTheir combined knowledge could save people a lot of tidying time they could be using for some R&R.\n\nREAD MORE: Baking soda for cleaning: 6 little known ways to use baking soda\n\nDeclutter\n\nAnyone wanting to reduce dust and dirt clutter can unburden themselves with some organisation.\n\nMr Harrison said: \"One of the biggest dust culprits is clutter, so if you have many decorative items or magazine in your living room, you may want to get rid of some to reduce the amount of dust.\n\n\"This will not only reduce clutter but will also make your home much cleaner and more spacious.\"\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nUse your vacuum\n\nMr Jonkler added those wanting to de-clutter should use specific vacuum attachments.\n\nThese should prevent dust from being displaced rather than extracted altogether.\n\nHe said: “The best thing to do is to de-clutter, then rather than dust with a duster or cloth, use a vacuum with a brush attachment, this sucks up dust instead of throwing it around the room.\n\n\"The less dry and damp wiping with cloths you do, on natural surfaces and painted surfaces, the longer they will hold up well.”\n\nDON'T MISS\n\n22 household cleaning hacks using baking soda, vinegar and lemons - EXPLAINER\n\nWindow cleaning: Mrs Hinch fans share simple hack to remove streaks - VIDEO\n\nStreaky shower glass: How to get rid of streaks on shower glass - INSIGHT\n\nWash sofa throws\n\nBlankets and sofa covers also attract dust, whether in regular use or not.\n\nMr Harrison advised people to wash them now and again to get some of it out.\n\nHe urged anyone attempting this to ensure they are washer-compatible first, otherwise they can hand wash them with soap and water.\n\nInvest in an air purifier\n\nAir purifiers, like humidifiers and conditioners, help improve air quality by room.\n\nMr Harrison said: \"These are designed to collect and trap dust particles that enter your home through open doors or windows.\n\n\"When choosing an air purifier, make sure you select one with a HEPA filter and place it near doors and windows to ensure it collects as much dust and hair as possible.”"
