        "text": "After the procedure\n\nMost people have to stay in hospital for a night after a full-thickness cornea transplant (penetrating keratoplasty).\n\nYou may be able to go home the same day if you have a partial-thickness transplant.\n\nYour eye may be covered with an eye pad or plastic shield, which is removed the day after the procedure.\n\nWhen it's taken away, you may find that your sight is blurred. This is normal.\n\nThere should not be serious pain after the operation, but there might be some swelling and discomfort.\n\nIf you have had an endothelial keratoplasty – a type of partial-thickness transplant that uses an air bubble to hold the donated cornea in place – you may be asked to lie on your back as much as possible in the first few days after surgery.\n\nThis can help hold the transplant in the correct place. The air bubble will be absorbed after a few days.\n\nLooking after your eye\n\nOnce you return home after the procedure, you'll need to take good care of your eye.\n\nSome important points to remember include:\n\ndo not rub your eyes\n\nduring the first weeks after surgery, avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting\n\nif you have a job that does not involve physical strain, you can return to work 2 to 3 weeks after surgery\n\nif your job involves manual labour, you should wait for 3 to 4 months\n\navoid smoky or dusty places as this could irritate your eyes\n\nif your eye is sensitive to light, wearing sunglasses can help\n\navoid contact sports and swimming until you're given clear advice that it's safe, and wear protective goggles when resuming contact sports\n\nbath and shower as normal, but be careful not to get water in your eye for at least a month\n\ndo not drive until your specialist tells you it's possible\n\nYou'll usually be given a patch to wear at night for the first few weeks after surgery to help protect your eye.\n\nFor all types of cornea transplant, you have to use steroid or antibiotic eyedrops daily.\n\nThese are normally required for several months, although some people may need to use them for more than a year.\n\nThe drops reduce swelling and inflammation, and help prevent infection and rejection.\n\nYour vision\n\nThe time it takes for your vision to return after a cornea transplant can range from as little as a few weeks up to a year or more.\n\nThis largely depends on the specific procedure used. In some cases, your vision may fluctuate between being better or worse before it settles down.\n\nIt's likely you'll need corrective lenses (either glasses or contact lenses), even after your vision returns.\n\nIn some cases, a small operation called arcuate keratotomy (AK) or laser treatment is used to correct vision problems after your eyes have healed."
