Unfortunately my memories of the real history are a little hazy; but I seem to remeber that \"Nobby Clark\" was the name of a man who was either the worlds tallest or fattest at the time of his death. Other Clarks have been afforded his Christian name as a nickname ever since.\n\nHarry, Bristol Britain\n\nIt may come from the same background as the nickname \"Dusty\" for anyone called Miller - it's a reference to the original employment of a clerk. Clerks who wrote with quill pens for 10 hours a day 6 days a week ended up with callouses and arthritic knuckles (with nobs on)...\n\nLane Blume, Marrickville Australia\n\nno matter how poorly paid they were, Clarks had to dress smartly like a 'nob' (toff, or well-to do) Thus Clark was always jokingly referred to as that Nobby Clark\n\nJulian McCarthy, Kingston upon Thames UK\n\nI was led to believe that Clarke's were so called because in ancient times when not too may people had learned to read and write, they would employ the use of a scribe to do their writing for them. The scribe wore a kind of pinafore with many little pockets with diferent colour bottles of inks, these inks formed knobs on the scribes clothing, and in time people gave him the nickname of Nobby.\n\nMaureen Clarke, Norwich, Norfolk\n\nAdd your answer"
