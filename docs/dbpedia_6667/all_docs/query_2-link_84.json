        "text": "The white residue on your dishes is generally nothing to worry about. It is caused by increased mineral deposits that are present in hard water and this is not something we have control over. Our dishwashers are equipped with a water softening system, which minimises the impact of hard water, both on the appliance and the cleaning results. However, there are a few things that you should be doing to ensure that your appliance continues to function at its best and this involves descaling the dishwasher, using dishwasher salt to support the water softening system as well as using rinse aid.\n\nBy descaling the appliance you will break down the build-up of limescale in the appliance, which also helps to reduce the white spots on your dishes. To cope with the water hardness, your appliance also needs to be topped up by dishwasher salt in order to breakdown the minerals in the hard water and reduce the white residue left behind on your dishes. You can read more about descaling the dishwasher here.\n\nWe recommend descaling your dishwasher every 4-6 months depending on usage frequency, and to top up the dishwasher salt accordingly. Please do not use any other type of salt as a substitute, as this may increase water hardness as well as damage your appliance."
