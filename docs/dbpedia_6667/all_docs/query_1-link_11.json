        "text": "One glance at social media reveals a whole army of The Traitors fans, who are lapping up every tiny morsel of the BBC gameshow. From Claudia Winkleman's fake tan and tartan combo to the now iconic Scottish highlands location, the internet also loves picking apart the intricacies of lying and deceit, and everything that goes with the show we know and love.\n\nBut what's it actually like to be on The Traitors? Is it as complex and competitive as watching the show makes out? Would you really struggle to know who to trust? And what happens to contestants after the banishing dinners?\n\nWe caught up with Alex Gray from The Traitors season one to find out. The presenter abd acwas a Faithful during her time on the show, who was eventually recruited by the Traitors to join the dark side. When she declined, she was murdered.\n\nThe application process involved multiple rounds of interviews, and the cast had to do their own preparation\n\n\"It was a lot of interviews, and we had a psychology assessment to make sure we were OK to film, because it's very intense in there. We also had to do a video submission application, and then a round of two truths and a lie.\n\n\"I bought two books online about the psychology of lying, but essentially learned that it's actually very hard to tell if someone's lying to you or not. Super helpful! There isn't really anything that could prepare you for that - I tried to watch a couple of episodes of The Traitors Netherlands but they didn't have subtitles.\"\n\nProducers tried to keep everything a surprise, so natural reactions were caught on camera\n\n\"We were given no information - we didn't even know Claudia [Winkleman] was presenting. We didn't know where the castle was, what it looked like, or what the challenges were going to be. Nothing was scripted and nothing was premeditated - it was all very authentic.\"\n\nThe show is filmed over multiple weeks, and filming days can be long\n\n\"I was there for a total of two weeks. You're filming very long hours, you're up quite late at night and you're not sleeping, because your brain is not turning off. You're thinking about it constantly - I'd fall asleep, and then I'd be dreaming about who the Traitors were! And then I'd wake up because I'd have revelations of who the Traitors might be. The little sleep you do get, you're worried about being murdered.\"\n\nIt feels all encompassing, to the point where contestants forget it's a game\n\n\"The cameras are on you all day long. You're fully immersed in it, and you can't switch off. There was no packing it away like with a board game - and even when you're no longer in the castle, you're still ruminating over stuff that happened; 'What if I had done this differently? Maybe this person is a Traitor?' You weren't told who the Traitors were when you were murdered or banished, so you were left wondering until the show aired. Obviously you realise it's a game - we're not idiots - but you're fully immersed in it, and it can feel like your emotional brain takes over from logic.\"\n\nContestants don't get to say goodbye to their fellow castmates when they're murdered or banished\n\n\"When you're banished, you're whisked away in a car and put on a plane back home. When you're murdered, you're told the next morning when the others go to breakfast. You're not told anything [about who the Traitors are]. Then you're obviously at home worrying about the edit and what's going to make the cut, how it's going to come across. You're reliving it, and it's interesting because you have your own memory of it. Viewers only see an hour of the edit each day, and it's weird seeing it condensed down.\"\n\nThe challenges aren't all filmed on the grounds of the castle\n\n\"We were moving around for them, and a lot of the time we would have blindfolds on, so it was always a shock. With the fairground [challenge], they didn't want us to see it [before filming] to spoil it, so when we took our blindfolds off it was like, 'Wow, that's amazing.'\n\n\"We filmed every day, and obviously, some of the challenges are physical, and some were more mental. I love pushing myself physically, so I loved the barrel challenge. The missions were my favourite part [of the show] because it was all about camaraderie, and we all came together with a common goal. Whoever was a Traitor, it didn't matter, because we all had a role to play; we all wanted to add to the money.\"\n\nThere's a welfare team on site to check in with contestants\n\n\"There was about one welfare person to every two cast members, just to make sure you all had snacks or if you needed a little moment to yourself. I have allergies, so couldn't eat the breakfast food, and there was always someone to sort it out. You could speak to a psychologist to ground yourself again and bring you back to reality if you needed it. To say, 'It's OK, it's not real life. It's just a game.' And then before the show came out, they would give us a little summary of each episode beforehand, just to prepare you mentally.'\"\n\nThe contestants are filmed all day, every day on the show\n\n\"Because we're all there together all day, anything could be said or anything could happen that could have an impact on the game. And if that's not caught on camera, it wouldn't make sense in the edit. But you end up forgetting the cameras are even there, they just blend it. It's weird how quickly you adapt to living your normal life.\"\n\nClaudia Winkleman doesn't have much involvement with the contestants\n\n\"It was obvious she wanted to talk to us and get to know us, but sometimes she'd come and get chatty and it was clear someone said something in her ear and she'd be like, 'Sorry guys, gotta go!' I think they wanted her to maintain this scary headmistress role, so that everytime we saw her it was like Pavlovian conditioning. From a production standpoint, she wasn't meant to make friends with us.\"\n\nContestants can't be anyone but themselves in there\n\n\"I think [in future episodes], people might try and put on a facade, or try and act a certain role. But from my experience of being in there, I don't even think the top actors could maintain playing a different person. It's so long and intense, you're under such a high pressure cooker environment that you're going to crack. It would be interesting to see someone try and pretend to be a different person, but it would be so challenging.\"\n\nThe Traitors continues on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 9pm on BBC One."
