        "text": "Tom Hardy's looking a bit dusty in a new picture from Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nThe actor - who recently exited the Suicide Squad film - looks like a piece of art in the stylised image from the upcoming post-apocalyptic movie.\n\nThe whole world recently went mad in the trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road and it looks as if it's right.\n\nIn the world of fire and blood, and sand, lots of sand, more sand than seems entirely necessary for even a desert, Tom Hardy is Mad Max, only not as you remember him.\n\n\"Out here everything hurts,\" says an ominous-sounding, shaven-headed Charlize Theron in the trailer.. \"You wanna get through this? Do as I say. Now pick up what you can and run.\"\n\nSo he does and it's very sandy. Did we mention there's quite a lot of sand in the post-apocalyptic creation from director George Miller? Because there is.\n\nHere's the 5 things we learned from the trailer:\n\nSand\n\nEnough sand! I'm itching just looking at it. It's not like degus are flocking to the flicks to watch movies for their sand-content. Dessert, wasteland, or whatever, it doesn't matter - tarmac's never looked so good.\n\nTom Hardy\n\nThat's all.\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nEven in a film with a gruff Tom Hardy, the Oscar-winning actress pulls out a performance that shows that she is large and in charge. No-one will mess with her. No-one should dare.\n\nEnough opera\n\nThe opera, all the opera. It's amazing how opera survived the apocalypse, isn't it? Cockroaches, sand and opera - that's what we've all got to look forward to.\n\nNo Mel Gibson\n\nThis is A Good Thing."
