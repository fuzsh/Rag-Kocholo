        "text": "Set in 1987, this movie centers on the son of a Pakistani immigrant to Britain, who become enamored of the music of Bruce Springsteen. Although most of the film's music is indeed by Springsteen, other period music can be heard as well, including an opening sequence set to the Pet Shop Boy's \"It's a Sin.\" One of the characters also specifically asserts that it's the best #1 hit of the year.\n\nDescribed by Wikipedia as a \"romantic fantasy… loosely based on the 1987 novel Strangers by Taichi Yamada,\" this film concerns a gay man on the cusp of a new relationship who somehow finds himself back at his childhood home, complete with his deceased parents, just as they were in the circa 1987 when he was 12 years old shortly before his parents were killed in a car crash—only he himself is an adult. Not surprisingly, the film includes music of this mystical late-eighties \"resetting,\" with the PSB version of \"Always on My Mind\" playing a significant and highly symbolic role (his mother even sings some of its lyrics directly to him), perhaps because the main character's late parents are indeed very often if not literally always on his mind. (The song also features very prominently in the film's trailer.) What's more, the Introspective version of \"I Want a Dog\" can be heard in another scene set in a dance club."
