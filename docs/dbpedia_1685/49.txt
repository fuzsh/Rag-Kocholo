He worked in a local record store, which helped to lay the foundations for his music career.

Career

Khaled first became known in the 1990s when he was a DJ on the Miami hip-hop radio station 99 Jamz. His job at the radio station is what led the group Terror Squad to hire Khaled as their DJ. Once he had a few credits to his name with Terror Squad, Khaled moved into curating albums and released his debut studio album "Listennnâ€¦ the Album" in 2006. Khaled went on to release "We The Best" in 2007, "We Global" in 2008, "Victory" in 2010, "We the Best Forever" in 2011, "Kiss the Ring" in 2012, "Suffering from Success" in 2013, "I Changed A Lot" in 2015, "Major Key" in 2016," "Grateful" in 2017, and "Father of Asahd" in 2019. His album "Khaled Khaled" was released in 2021, with "God Did" following in 2022.

One of Khaled's most successful songs is "All I Do Is Win," which features Ludacris, Rick Ross, Snoop Dogg, and T-Pain. The song is off Khaled's 2010 album "Victory" and was the album's second single. The song has been certified three times platinum by the RIAA.

Back in late 2015 and early 2016, some Snapchat videos of Khaled talking about his "key to success" got a lot of attention due to his larger-than-life personality. He became an internet star, and some people called him a "living meme." Today, Khaled is one of the most sought-after producers in hip-hop and a very popular social media personality.

In 2018, he joined Demi Lovato as the opening act for her Tell Me You Love Me Tour, which kicked off in San Diego, California, in February 2018 and ran through July 2018.

On May 21, 2019, DJ Khaled shared a new video for "Wish Wish," featuring Cardi B and 21 Savage. Directed by Khaled and Eif Rivera, the clip features lots of explosions, fire, and motocross riders, which looks like a B-level early-2000s street-racing movie raced into production to capitalize on the success of the first Fast and The Furious.

Khaled wrote the book "The Keys" which made the New York Times Best Seller list. The book includes his opinions on success, recounts life stories, and describes contributions from other musicians.

He has also worked as an actor, starring in 2017's "Pitch Perfect 3," 2019's "Spies in Disguise," and in 2020's "Bad Boys for Life."
