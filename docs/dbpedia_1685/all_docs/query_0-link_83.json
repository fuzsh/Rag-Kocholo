Khaled's value proposition is his extensive network of artists of whom he enlists to perform on studio recordings.

Furthermore, his interviews, quotes, or other presentative qualities have often been described as \"motivational\" or \"inspirational\". Despite commercial success, the albums in Khaled's discography have often garnered largely mixed receptions from music critics.\n\nVictory is the fourth studio album by American disc jockey and record producer DJ Khaled.
