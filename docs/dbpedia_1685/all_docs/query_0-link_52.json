        "text": "Let’s give props where props are due.\n\nThe mighty Prince Paul deserves praise for his role in elevating and popularizing the hip-hop album skit in with his work on De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising in 1989.\n\n“Rap records always had some dialogue in them, like, ‘Hey, man, I’m gonna smack you in the face,’ or, ‘Yo… let’s get it!’ but they weren’t sketches with a whole vibe to them,” Paul explained to the Red Bull Academy. “We did it to fill that void, to give our album some structure. It was just something we tried out and it evolved. We never thought it would become a rap album staple.”\n\nOh, boy, did it ever. Just ask Dr. Trevis, Ken Kaniff or Pain In Da Ass. OK, I’m reloaded!\n\nWhile the 1990s undeniably ushered in the golden age of the hip-hop skit, as the majority of artists slipped into the format and strived to eat up all the 80 minutes available on a compact disc, the new millennium has also brought its fair share of memorable interludes.\n\nWhether serving to push a narrative forward, giving us a breather from the beats, giving us a peek into the artist’s personality or simply making us laugh out loud, the rap skit still holds value. It may not be as prevalent a tool as it once was, but a good sketch can hold replay value and enhance the full-length experience.\n\nHere’s a sampling of some of the best skits from this century. Don’t be so quick to hit that fast-forward button. —Luke Fox"
