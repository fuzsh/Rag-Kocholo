Some of these artists are still among the biggest stars in music while others literally have not been heard from in years. Through our knowledge of the music industry and being on the pulse of everything these artists have got going on, we help fill in the gaps to keep you posted on what some of your favorites have been up to.\n\nThis list includes any male R&B singer who released their debut album between 2000 and 2009.
