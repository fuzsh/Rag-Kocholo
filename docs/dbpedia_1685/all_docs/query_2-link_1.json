        "text": "DJ Khaled and his We The Best Music Group have signed an exclusive deal with Epic Records, reuniting the record producer/executive with label Chairman and CEO L.A. Reid. Founded in 2006, We The Best Music Group is Khaled’s own label, studio and management, publishing and production companies. Khaled’s first release under We The Best/Epic Records, titled Major Key, will be available soon.\n\n“Khaled is a supremely gifted artist and social media guru whose music has defined hip-hop and R&B for the past decade,” said Reid, who first signed Khaled/We The Best to Def Jam in 2008. “With an extremely loyal fan base radiating world­wide out of Miami, every new release by Khaled has now become a firestorm event and his devoted legion of fans only grows bigger by the day. With Khaled’s passion and creative savvy, together with our dedicated and versatile staff, we are poised to reach even greater heights together than ever before.”\n\n‘Hip-Hop’s Quincy Jones’ DJ Khaled Reveals Who ‘They’ Are to Ellen DeGeneres\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nDJ Khaled released his debut album, Listennn… the Album, in 2006 on his fully indie We The Best imprint. Two years and several singles (“We Takin’ Over” and “I’m So Hood”) later, Khaled linked-up with Reid’s Def Jam for distribution. He climbed the Billboard charts with 2010’s “All I Do Is Win” and “I’m on One” a year later, and has sold over 15 million singles to date. He released his eighth studio album, I Changed A Lot, in late 2015.\n\nHe’s also amassed a huge social footprint, with 6 million-plus followers on Snapchat and another 3 million on both Instagram and Twitter.\n\nWatch DJ Khaled Explain Snapchat to Jimmy Kimmel\n\nCommented Khaled: “We The Best Music/Epic. Those two brands are synonymous with quality music. Iconic music. LA Reid was the first executive to give We The Best Music an opportunity to distribute my music on a grand scale. It is a very satisfying feeling to realign myself with someone who shares my vision of bringing fans the best music possible.”"
