        "text": "Known professionally as DJ Khaled, the DJ is an Arab-American DJ, rapper, record producer, record executive, and also actor, and writer. Born Khaled Mohammed Khaled in November 1975 in New Orleans, Louisana, the DJ has released 12 albums, won 31 awards, been nominated for 132 awards, and has become a supremely successful musician. He has collaborated with huge artists like Beyonce, Drake, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dog, Nas, Ludacris, Akon, and many more.\n\nWith parents as musicians, Khaled has always been interested in music, and first entered the scene in the 1990s as a host on the radio station, 99 Jamz. This gig led to him working as a DJ for the hip-hop collective Terror Squad on their live performances in 1998. Khaled also worked in record studios around this time, helping artists like Lil Wayne and Birdman in the industry. He operated under many different names throughout the years, with the most popular being “Arab Attack”.\n\nFollowing his success with Terror Squad, DJ Khaled released his debut studio album in 2006, Listennn… the Album which reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 charts. He released his next album We The Best in 2007 which reached number eight. His following two albums, We Global and Victory chartered in the top ten on the US Billboard 200. Victory contained the single “All I Do is Win” which become certified triple platinum.\n\nKhaled become internationally recognized after his fifth studio album in 2011, We the Best Forever which featured the top ten hit, “I’m on One”. His next two albums, Kiss the Ring (2021) and Suffering from Success (2013) both charted in the top ten on the Billboard 200, but his eighth album I Changed a Lot (2015) only peaked at number 12. Khaled’s ninth album, Major Key (2016) was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It was also certified gold and received a Best Rap Album Grammy nomination. It was around this time that Khaled’s popularity also grew thanks to his social media activity.\n\nThe DJ’s tenth album, Grateful (2017) reached number one on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum, containing two big hit singles. In 2019 his eleventh album, Father of Asahd peaked at number two, but his single “Higher” won the Best Rap/Sung Performance at the Grammy’s (his first Grammy win). His latest two albums, Khaled Khaled (2021) and God Did (2022) both reached number one in the charts.\n\nKhaled has also done some work outside of music, appearing in the musical film, Pitch Perfect 3, as well as Spies in Disguise, and Bad Boys for Life and working as a judge on the singing competition, The Four. The DJ married clothing company founder, Nicole Tuck in 2005 who he shares two sons with, Asahd Tuck Khaled and Aalam Tuck Khaled.\n\nFamous DJ Khaled Trademarks\n\nDespite being in the industry for nearly two decades before his first album, DJ Khaled has become an internationally-recognized rap artist since his first album release in 2006. He has won several awards and has started to diversify his career. Protecting his assets and IP with USPTO could save him several future legal battles as well as millions of dollars. DJ Khaled currently has just 21 trademarks registered. Let’s take a look at his most famous ones, registered by ATK Entertainment, Inc.\n\nWe The Best\n\n“We The Best” was the first thing that Khaled trademarked. Not only was it the title of his second studio album in 2007, but “We The Best Music Group” is also the name of the American record label that DJ Khaled founded in 2008, and has become a popular catchphrase for the music mogul. He didn’t register the phrase for a trademark until 2012, but has since updated it throughout the years to cover:\n\nMusical sound recordings; downloadable musical sound recordings\n\nEntertainment services in the nature of recording, production, and post-production services in the field of music; production of musical sound recordings; music production services; entertainment services in the nature of presenting live musical performances\n\nmusical sound recordings; musical video recordings; headphones; protective covers and cases for cell phones\n\nClothing, namely, shirts, jackets, tops, caps, and hats; footwear; headwear\n\nDisc jockey services; music video production; entertainment services in the nature of recording, production, and post-production services in the field of music; production of musical sound recordings; music production services; entertainment services in the nature of presenting live musical performances; entertainment services in the nature of live disc jockey and rap artist personality performances; entertainment services, namely, live appearances by a professional entertainer; arranging, organizing, conducting, and hosting social entertainment events; master of ceremonies for parties, live musical entertainment performances, and special entertainment and social events; arranging, organizing and conducting and hosting night club parties; hosting special entertainment and social events for others\n\nElectronic cigarette liquid (e-liquid) comprised of vegetable glycerin\n\nOnline retail store services featuring clothing and apparel, footwear, fashion accessories, headphones, entertainment electronics\n\nEntertainment services in the nature of an ongoing music and talk radio program featuring music, comedy, current events, inspirational and motivational programming, and celebrity interviews\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nThe DJ didn’t trademark his stage name, “DJ Khaled” until 2016, despite releasing his first studio album under the name ten years earlier. The trademark largely covers his services as a DJ and his music. The rapper hasn’t updated what the trademark covers since registering for it. The wordmark trademark currently covers:\n\nMusical sound recordings; musical video recordings\n\nDisc jockey services; entertainment services in the nature of live disc jockey and rap artist personality performances; arranging, organizing, conducting, and hosting social entertainment events; master of ceremonies for parties, live musical entertainment performances, and special entertainment and social events; arranging, organizing and conducting and hosting night club parties; hosting special entertainment and social events for others\n\nKey logo\n\nKhaled has only one trademarked logo in his portfolio which features an illustration of a key emoji. This mostly relates to Khaled’s very popular videos on Snapchat in 2015 where he would share his advice, called “keys to success” and used the key emoji as part of these videos. He also has an album entitled “Major Key” (2016), a song called “I Got the Keys”, as well as a book released in 2016 called “The Keys”, a memoir that also shares his major keys to success. The DJ has trademarked several key-related slogans, but the key emoji is the only logo he has trademarked.

The DJ regularly uses the catchphrase in his social media videos and refers to having another success. Whether it’s a song, a possession, or an accomplishment, “another one” is all about building momentum. Khaled uses this phrase at the beginning of his songs, referencing ‘another’ big hit. He also used this phrase in a series of GEICO ads. The rap artist trademarked the character mark in 2016 and it applies to:\n\nShirts, tops, headwear, and footwear\n\nEntertainment and educational services, namely, providing motivational and inspirational non-downloadable video presentations online in the field of personal improvement and personal development; educational services, namely, providing regular public service announcements online in non-downloadable video format in the field of health insurance coverage, education, nutrition, and personal improvement; providing a website featuring non-downloadable videos and photographs containing inspirational and humorous topics of general interest; entertainment services in the nature of master of ceremonies services; disc jockey services; entertainment services, namely, live appearances by a professional entertainer\n\nRead more: Trademarking a catchphrase\n\nAsahd\n\nThe thing that Khaled has trademarked the most is his two sons’ names.

Seven of these trademarks are related to his children’s names. Khaled has trademarked several phrases, but hasn’t trademarked many of his album names or song titles, and also hasn’t covered much merchandise such as clothing. He has also hardly covered anything with the trademark of his name, not even merchandise. His most recent trademarks for his children’s names perhaps show that he starting to realize the importance of registering his IP and assets with USPTO and there will be more to come in the future. Trademarking can save you millions of dollars, time spent in legal battles, and future headaches. As someone with a net worth of $75 million, there’s a lot more he could be doing to protect himself."
