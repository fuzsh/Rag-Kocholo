        "text": "To what extent did the foreign, defense, and human rights policies of Benazir Bhutto, which were deemed quite liberal for the time she served as PM of Pakistan, contribute to the motives of her assassination?\n\nThe first source which will be evaluated in depth is Benazir Bhutto’s autobiography, “Daughter of the East” originally published in 1988. The origin of this source is valuable because the readers are privy to Benazir’s political and personal life from her perspective. Furthermore, the publication date of this source, 1988, strengthens its credibility as Benazir was at her political peak and had started her first term as the first female PM of Pakistan.\n\nThe purpose of choosing Benazir’s autobiography is because it has a coherent build-up from her life as Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s daughter to becoming Pakistan’s PM. The second source evaluated in detail is the documentary of her life titled “Bhutto” and released in 2010. The origin of this source is important because the documentary goes into great depth about Benazir Bhutto’s political journey and how she rose to power. Moreover, the release date of this source bolsters its authenticity because it was produced almost 3 years after her passing.\n\nThe documentary explored various aspects of the investigation conducted after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and opens up to controversial conclusions. Both sources delve into unnerving detail about Benazir Bhutto’s multiple foreign, defense, and human rights policies which were quite liberal for the time she served as PM of Pakistan, and deal with the possibility of how they could have led to her assassination.\n\nOther articles and opposing perspectives have also been analyzed as a result to give the investigation a coherent and equitable perspective and to stay true to an unbiased analysis of the research question.\n\nThe Pak-US relationship remained strained during 1988-1990. The US had already banned economic and military allowances via the Pressler Amendment which certified, “Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States assistance program will significantly reduce the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device.”\n\nDuring Benazir Bhutto’s first tenure, she signed various agreements to enhance Pakistan’s defense system. Benazir Bhutto visited the US to address the F-16 issue and asked the US to supply aircrafts and other military weapons that Pakistan had already paid for. It is discussed in various articles how Pakistan’s nuclear enhancements might have been perceived as a threat to India and the US, henceforth leading to her assassination.\n\nIn order to sustain an authoritative defense system for Pakistan, Benazir had to ensure Pakistan’s military forces had developed a modern and conventional arsenal to avert India’s threats, and to achieve this goal, Pakistan needed trustworthy allies to reach out to in times of crisis. However, the doubt always remained if Pakistan’s allies would really have its back in dire times of need.\n\nBenazir Bhutto’s personal style of responding to internal and external threats had an impressive effect on Pakistan’s relations with the US. Despite the enmity between Pakistan and the US, Benazir Bhutto’s diplomatic and political strategies proved that Pakistan could be respected globally without being seen as a menace.\n\nBenazir Bhutto’s time in office is partitioned into two periods: 1988 to 1990 and 1993 to 1996. Pakistan’s relations with the US occupy a vital place in Pakistan’s foreign policy. The two states have generally kept up positive approaches toward each other, but their interaction has not continuously advanced easily. During Benazir Bhutto’s second term, relations with the US were unsteady again and added to the aggression towards Pakistan and its leader, Benazir Bhutto.\n\nWhilst developing foreign policies in accordance with the world’s superpowers, Benazir Bhutto continued to work on Pakistan’s defense systems and carried on the agenda her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had initiated.\n\nBefore taking oath as the first lady Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto held an assembly with the US Ambassador Mr. Oakley, Caretaker President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and three Services Chiefs of Pakistan to discuss the current political circumstances. At that time, Pakistan occupied a noticeable place within the US foreign policy due to its vital location.\n\nThe US had essentially contributed to Pakistan’s financial advancement and had fortified its protection capability. President George Bush welcomed Benazir Bhutto on an official visit to the US. It is well known that the relations of the nations can be fortified through visits and signing diverse assertions from time to time. The fundamental proposal of her visit from a wide perspective was to reinforce companionship through mutual cooperation in economic, trade, and distinctive sorts of agreements.\n\nSince the mediation of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in 1979, Pakistan enjoyed an exceptionally great military association with the US. In 1989, Benazir Bhutto introduced an atomic control plant in Kot Addu where she reiterated her government’s desire to create atomic vitality for peaceful purposes.\n\nBenazir Bhutto said that the country was “committed to a peaceful nuclear policy for energy purposes. We do not want doubts to shadow Pakistan’s policy and in the process of isolating the country when there is so much goodwill around”. However, the US was of the opinion that Pakistan was still active in making an atomic weapon. President George Bush made clear that until and unless Pakistan stopped its nuclear weapon program the US would not give military and financial help to Pakistan.\n\nIt is likely that the resolute posture of Benazir Bhutto concerning Pakistan’s military buildup and economic potential was not the sole but definitely a very prominent cause.\n\nIf you want to submit your articles and/or research papers, please check the Submissions page.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article/paper are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial position of Paradigm Shift.\n\n(Visited 262 times, 1 visits today)"
