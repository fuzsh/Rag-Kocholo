        "text": "PATERSON – U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ-08) a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus released the following statement in response to the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto:\n\n“I am deeply disturbed by the shocking assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. My support and condolences go out to Ms Bhutto’s family and the people of Pakistan who have suffered a vicious attack upon their efforts to achieve democracy. As a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus I have long felt that the people of Pakistan deserve lasting stability and legitimate democratic institutions that can survive the rule of any one individual.\n\n“It is not nearly enough for the White House to condemn this assassination; it is time for this Administration to finally hold President Musharraf to account. Our lack of real action and strong support for democracy in Pakistan has destabilized the nation and crippled our ability to fight the extremists who thrive within the region. It has become clear that Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership is still thriving in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n“Today’s brutal assassination is not only a setback for democracy, but is an indication of the Bush Administration’s failed strategy in the war on terror that has seemingly forgotten where the 9/11 attack truly originated.”\n\n###"
