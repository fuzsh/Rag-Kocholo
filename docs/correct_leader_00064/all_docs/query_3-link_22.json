        "text": "Ms Bhutto had a volatile political career\n\nBenazir Bhutto followed her father into politics, and both of them died because of it - he was executed in 1979, she fell victim to an apparent suicide bomb attack.\n\nHer two brothers also suffered violent deaths.\n\nLike the Nehru-Gandhi family in India, the Bhuttos of Pakistan are one of the world's most famous political dynasties. Benazir's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was prime minister of Pakistan in the early 1970s.\n\nHis government was one of the few in the 30 years following independence that was not run by the army.\n\nBorn in 1953 in the province of Sindh and educated at Harvard and Oxford, Ms Bhutto gained credibility from her father's high profile, even though she was a reluctant convert to politics.\n\nShe was twice prime minister of Pakistan, from 1988 to 1990, and from 1993 to 1996.\n\nStubbornness\n\nOn both occasions she was dismissed from office by the president for alleged corruption.\n\nThe dismissals typified her volatile political career, which was characterised by numerous peaks and troughs. At the height of her popularity - shortly after her first election - she was one of the most high-profile women leaders in the world.\n\nYoung and glamorous, she successfully portrayed herself as a refreshing contrast to the overwhelmingly male-dominated political establishment.\n\nBut after her second fall from power, her name came to be seen by some as synonymous with corruption and bad governance.\n\nAsif Zardari has faced numerous corruption charges\n\nThe determination and stubbornness for which Ms Bhutto was renowned was first seen after her father was imprisoned by Gen Zia ul-Haq in 1977, following a military coup. Two years later he was executed after a much criticised trial on charges of conspiring to murder a political opponent.\n\nMs Bhutto was imprisoned just before her father's death and spent most of her five-year jail term in solitary confinement. She described the conditions as extremely hard.\n\nDuring stints out of prison for medical treatment, Ms Bhutto set up a Pakistan People's Party office in London, and began a campaign against General Zia.\n\nShe returned to Pakistan in 1986, attracting huge crowds to political rallies.\n\nAfter Gen Zia died in an explosion on board his aircraft in 1988, she became one of the first democratically elected female prime ministers in an Islamic country.\n\nCorruption charges\n\nDuring both her stints in power, the role of Ms Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, proved highly controversial.\n\nHe played a prominent role in both her administrations, and has been accused by various Pakistani governments of stealing millions of dollars from state coffers - charges he denies, as did Ms Bhutto herself.\n\nMany commentators argued that the downfall of Ms Bhutto's government was accelerated by the alleged greed of her husband.\n\nNone of about 18 corruption and criminal cases against Mr Zardari has been proved in court after 10 years. But he served at least eight years in jail.\n\nHe was freed on bail in 2004, amid accusations that the charges against him were weak and going nowhere.\n\nMs Bhutto also steadfastly denied all the corruption charges against her, which she said were politically motivated.\n\nShe faced corruption charges in at least five cases, all without a conviction, until amnestied in October 2007.\n\nPresident Pervez Musharraf granted Ms Bhutto and others an amnesty\n\nShe was convicted in 1999 for failing to appear in court, but the Supreme Court later overturned that judgement.\n\nSoon after the conviction, audiotapes of conversations between the judge and some top aides of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were discovered that showed that the judge had been under pressure to convict.\n\nMs Bhutto left Pakistan in 1999 to live abroad, but questions about her and her husband's wealth continued to dog her.\n\nShe appealed against a conviction in the Swiss courts for money-laundering.\n\nDuring her years outside Pakistan, Ms Bhutto lived with her three children in Dubai, where she was joined by her husband after he was freed in 2004.\n\nShe was a regular visitor to Western capitals, delivering lectures at universities and think-tanks and meeting government officials.\n\nArmy mistrust\n\nMs Bhutto returned to Pakistan on 18 October 2007 after President Musharraf signed into law an ordinance granting her and others an amnesty from corruption charges.\n\nObservers said the military regime saw her as a natural ally in its efforts to isolate religious forces and their surrogate militants.\n\nShe declined a government offer to let her party head the national government after the 2002 elections, in which the party received the largest number of votes.\n\nIn the months before her death, she had emerged again as a strong contender for power.\n\nSome in Pakistan believe her secret talks with the military regime amounted to betrayal of democratic forces as these talks shored up President Musharraf's grip on the country.\n\nOthers said such talks indicated that the military might at long last be getting over its decades-old mistrust of Ms Bhutto and her party, and interpreted it as a good omen for democracy.\n\nWestern powers saw in her a popular leader with liberal leanings who could bring much needed legitimacy to Mr Musharraf's role in the \"war against terror\".\n\nUnhappy family\n\nBenazir Bhutto was the last remaining bearer of her late father's political legacy.\n\nHer brother, Murtaza - who was once expected to play the role of party leader - fled to the then-communist Afghanistan after his father's fall.\n\nFrom there, and various Middle Eastern capitals, he mounted a campaign against Pakistan's military government with a militant group called al-Zulfikar.\n\nHe won elections from exile in 1993 and became a provincial legislator, returning home soon afterwards, only to be shot dead under mysterious circumstances in 1996.\n\nBenazir's other brother, Shahnawaz - also politically active but in less violent ways than Murtaza - was found dead in his French Riviera apartment in 1985."
