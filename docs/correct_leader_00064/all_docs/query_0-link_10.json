Due to the PPP only securing a plurality, the new government forged a coalition alliance with the MQM, ANP, JUI(FR) and other additional independents.[2]: 398 Following elections President Ghulam Ishaq Khan called upon Benazir Bhutto, later announcing the formation of a new government.[3]: 211 Benazir promised while taking oath on 2 December to eradicate illiteracy, poverty, restore student unions, liberate political prisoners, provide equal rights to women and free the media. However, the Army's continued influence and lack of a legislative majority led to her later declaring her government's freedom of action was \"institutionally, economically, politically (and) structurally\" constrained.[4]: 298 Later during Presidential elections the same year, Benazir Bhutto solidified her alliance with President Ishaq Khan through supporting his bid for re-election.[2]: 398 However later the two came into conflict, over the division of powers between the two offices and as the President continued to support Bhutto's opponent Nawaz Sharif.[2]: 401–402 Eventually on 6 August, 1990 Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued an order under Article 58(2)(b) dissolving the National Assembly causing the Prime Minister and the cabinet to cease holding office. The stated charges of dismissal for the Bhutto government were corruption and the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh.[2]: 402–403\n\nFollowing the 1988 elections, the PPP did not gain a majority but emerged as the largest single party with 93 seats, 11 seats short to form a majority. The second largest party in the National assembly being the IJI and its 55 seats. Independents had secured 23 seats, MQM 13 seats, and JUI (Fazlur-Rehman Group) 7 seats. Nawaz Sharif the following day announced that the IJI would form a government, according to Hamid Khan, Sharif intended to make up for his lack of a electoral plurality through the support of the President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.[2]: 397 Following MQM and ANP alliance with the PPP, the President instead decided to call upon Benazir to meet with him, and shortly later it was announced that the first civilian-led government in eleven years was to be formed.[3]: 211 According to Lawrence Ziring, Ishaq Khan pursued this path in order to establish stability \"as quickly as possible\" and because he was disinclined to see the army under Aslam Beg take control of the government following Zia's death.[3]: 210 Hamid Khan claims that Ghulam Ishaq Khan sought a full five-year term as President, so after \"delivering a majority in the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab to the IJI\" to counterbalance Bhutto he sought a deal with the PPP for his election. In the later Presidential elections that year, the PPP ignored its old ally Nawabzada Nasrullah for Ishaq Khan, who won with 603 votes out of 752.[2]: 398\n\nThe Islami Jamhoori Ittehad in Punjab would be able to secure 34.98% of the vote.[4]: 296 Despite the PPP (52 seats) securing more seats than the IJI (45 seats) in the National Assembly, in the Provincial Assembly the IJI secured got 108 seats compared to the PPP's 94. With the help of most of the independents the IJI would be able to form a government with Nawaz Sharif as Chief Minister.[2]: 399 Punjab would provide the main power base of the IJI, comprising both Nawaz Sharif and Junejo Muslim leagues and eight other allied parties held together by opposition to the PPP. According to Muhammad Waseem, the incumbent caretaker Chief Ministers used public funds to finance its candidates during the election. According to Ian Talbot, the requirement that voters produce identity cards also strengthened the IJI.[4]: 295\n\nIn Sindh the PPP had won 67 out of a 100 general seats in the Provincial Assembly, securing a majority. Out of 31 independents in the Assembly, 26 belonged to the MQM but ran on independent tickets. On 20 March, the period until with which Governors could appoint Chief Ministers had lapsed, hence Qaim Ali Shah of the PPP was elected by the Provincial Assembly as Chief Minister of Sindh.[2]: 398\n\nIn the NWFP no single political party had won an absolute majority. Out of 80 general seats the IJI had won the highest (28 seats), followed by the PPP (22 seats), ANP (13 seats) and as many as 15 independents. In order to form a government, Benazir approached Wali Khan head of the ANP to form a coalition, with the offer being accepted. Several independents also joined the PPP-ANP in NWFP. Aftab Sherpao would form the government as Chief Minister. Later when the PPP-ANP coalition broke down he would remain as CM.[2]: 398–399\n\nIn Balochistan, out of 40 general seats, 11 went to JUI(FR), 10 to the Balochistan National Alliance (BNA), 8 to the IJI, 4 to the PPP and the remaining seven to minor political parties and independents. The Provincial Assembly met on 2 December to elect the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the assembly and later to elect the Chief Minister of the province. Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali received 21 votes for and 21 votes against his bid for Chief Ministership. The Speaker issued a certificate declaring him elected by 22 votes including the casting vote of the speaker.[2]: 399\n\nPresident of Pakistan Prime Minister of Pakistan Ghulam Ishaq Khan\n\n1988-1993\n\nBenazir Bhutto[a]\n\n1988-1990\n\nFederal Ministers under Benazir Bhutto Name Portfolio Period Citation 1 Begum Nusrat Bhutto ● Senior Minister without portfolio 31 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 [5] 2 Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat ● Federal Minister of Commerce, Local Govt & Rural Development Industries 4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990 3 Makhdoom Amin Faheem ● Federal Minister of Communications\n\n● Federal Minister of Railways\n\n4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990\n\n6 December, 1988—23 March, 1989\n\n4 Agha Tariq Khan ● Federal Minister for Culture & Tourism\n\n● Federal Minister for Culture & Supports\n\n4 December, 1988—23 March, 1989\n\n30 March, 1989—6 August, 1990\n\n5 Rao Sikandar Iqbal ● Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Cooperatives 4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990 6 Sahabzada Yaqub Khan ● Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs 4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990 7 Syed Amir Haider Kazmi ● Federal Minister of Health, Special Education and Social welfare\n\n● Federal Minister of Education\n\n4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990\n\n6 December, 1988—23 March, 1989\n\n8 Jahangir Badr ● Federal Minister for Housing and Works\n\n● Federal Minister of Science & Technology\n\n● Federal Minister of Petroleum & Natural Resources\n\n4 December, 1988—23 March, 1989\n\n4 December, 1988—20 September, 1989\n\n6 December, 1988—6 August, 1990\n\n9 Aitzaz Ahsan ● Federal Minister of Interior\n\n● Federal Minister of Law and Justice\n\n4 December, 1988—6 August, 1990\n\n4 December, 1988—28 December, 1988\n\n10 Mukhtar Ahmad Awan ● Federal Minister of Labour Manpower & Overseas Pakistanis\n\n● Federal Minister of Labour\n\n4 December, 1988—11 November, 1989\n\n11 November, 1989—6 August, 1990\n\n11 Muhammad Hanif Khan ● Federal Minister of States and Frontier Regions & Kashmir Affairs\n\n● Federal Minister of Housing & Works\n\n4 December, 1988—23 March, 1989\n\n4 December, 1988—28 January, 1990\n\n12 Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani ● Federal Minister of Law and Justice 28 December, 1988—6 August, 1990 13 Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari ● Federal Minister of Water and Power 28 December, 1988—6 August, 1990 14 Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah ● Federal Minister of Education 23 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 15 Zafar Ali Leghari ● Federal Minister of Railways 23 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 16 Ali Nawaz Shah ● Federal Minister of Industries 23 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 17 Khan Bahadar Khan ● Federal Minister of Religious Affairs & Minorities Affairs 23 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 18 Khawaja Ahmad Tariq Raheem ● Federal Minister of Parliamentary Affairs 23 March, 1989—6 August, 1990 19 Mir.
