        "meta_description": "<p>Updated: April 16, 2010</p><p>Benazir Bhutto 1953 - 2007</p><p>Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of a prime minister of Pakistan who held that post twice herself, died on Dec. 27, 2007 in a suicide attack on a political rally as she campaigned to hold that post a third time.</p><p>Ms. Bhutto, who was 54 at the time of her death, was a member of one of Pakistan's most prominent families, albeit one touched by tragedy. Her father was ousted and hanged by the Pakistani military and two of her brothers died violent deaths.</p><p>Ms. Bhutto took over the leadership of her father's party and became the first woman leader of an Islamic country when she was first elected prime minister in 1988 at the age of 35. She served a total of six years in office before being dismissed in 1996 amid widespread charges of corruption against herself and her husband. She took up residence in London.</p><p>In the summer of 2007, with the encouragement of Washington, she entered into power-sharing talks with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who had seized power in 1999 from Ms. Bhutto's successor. But no deal was reached, and Ms. Bhutto returned to the country in October in an ambiguous position, not quite allied with General Musharraf and not quite opposed. When he imposed emergency rule in November, she waited several days before denouncing the move.</p><p>She was leading a rally for her Pakistan People's Party in the parliamentary campaign she hoped would restore her to power early in 2008 when she was killed.</p><p>In April 2010, a United Nations investigation into her assassination concluded that the failure of Pakistani authorities to effectively investigate the killing was \"deliberate\" and had been \"severely hampered\" by the country's powerful intelligence agencies.</p><p>The 65-page report did not answer the question of who killed Ms. Bhutto, or even give the precise cause of death, which occurred after a 15-year-old suicide bomber detonated his payload. But it concluded, \"No one believes that this boy acted alone.\"</p><p>The report was particularly scathing of the role of Saud Aziz, the police chief in Rawalpindi, the city where the assassination took place, who made a series of decisions that denied investigators valuable evidence. These included orders to hose down the crime scene less than two hours after the attack. Hosting long lunches and serving tea, he then delayed investigators for two full days from reaching the site, where they finally spent seven horus wading through a drainage sewer to retrieve a single bullet casing. Mr. Aziz was also criticized in the report for deliberately preventing an autopsy.</p><p>Ms. Bhutto had raised concerrns about Pakistanis she believed were a threat to her security with General Musharraf. His failure to provide Ms. Bhutto, a former prime minister, with the same security that was extended to two other former prime ministers, who were political allies, was particularly disturbing, the report said.</p><p>&#160;<a class=\"more\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/world/asia/28bhutto.html\">Read the complete obituary &#187;</a></p>",
