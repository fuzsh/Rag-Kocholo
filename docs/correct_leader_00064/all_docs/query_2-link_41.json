        "text": "Bhutto participated in a number of events during her 24-hour visit to Elon’s campus, holding a Q & A session, having a luncheon with students, holding a news conference with journalism students, and visiting the new Cannon Centre where she met staff members and other members of the campus community. She also stayed overnight at Maynard House with President Leo M. Lambert and his family.\n\n“I recall fondly that Prime Minister Bhutto sat with my wife, Laurie, and me in our sunroom and talked about her family,” Lambert said. “She was concerned about her mother, who was beginning to experience the frailties of old age at that time. It struck me that even though she was a world leader, she shared the same set of concerns that all of us have.”"
