        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nDecember 27, 2007\n\nCONTACT: Ryan Murphy\n\n(202) 225-2452 (Office)\n\n(202) 689-4825 (Cell)\n\nWilson Statement on the Death of Benazir Bhutto\n\nCongressman Joe Wilson (SC-02) issued the following statement today after hearing of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\n“I am deeply troubled and saddened by the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,” said Wilson. “This terrible act is a chilling reminder of the violent attacks in the Global War on Terrorism that took the lives of moderate leaders including President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in 1981 by terrorists who evolved into al Qaeda. President Pervez Musharraf himself has been subject to at least three assassination attempts by terrorists. Such attempts by extremists to undermine and destabilize the advancement of democracy and peace must not be allowed to succeed.”\n\n“I had the privilege of meeting Ms. Bhutto on November 30th in Islamabad at her home. We discussed her fond memories of speaking for the Lexington Medical Center Foundation several years ago. I witnessed her dedication to the people of Pakistan, her determination to stop terrorism, and her commitment to the tenants of democracy. My deepest sympathy is with her family and the people of Pakistan.”\n\n###"
