        "text": "Now that New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has hit world headlines by becoming only the second elected head of government to give birth in office, attention has naturally been drawn to the first such leader - Pakistan's late two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\nAnd there are some interesting coincidences here.\n\nMs Ardern's baby girl was delivered on 21 June - the very day Bhutto was born 65 five years earlier, in 1953.\n\nAlso, Ms Ardern is 37, as was Bhutto when she gave birth to her daughter Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari on 25 January 1990.\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari congratulated Ms Ardern.\n\nBut that's where the similarities end.\n\nMs Ardern announced her pregnancy a good six months before her expected delivery date. She has also taken six weeks' maternity leave and passed her duties to her deputy.\n\nBhutto kept her pregnancy secret and returned to work as soon as her doctor would allow.\n\nNot only was the country not told about her pregnancy, even colleagues were kept in the dark.\n\n\"None of us in the cabinet virtually knew that this prime minister was about to deliver a baby,\" Javed Jabbar, a member of her cabinet, later told the BBC.\n\n\"And then lo-and-behold suddenly we learn that she has not only gone and delivered democracy, she's also delivered a baby.\"\n\nBhutto was in stormy political waters at the time.\n\nWhen Bakhtawar was born, a military-funded right-wing alliance was besieging her government.\n\nShe had just survived a no-confidence vote, triggered by some of Pakistan's former ISI intelligence officials. They had tried to buy off Bhutto's supporters in parliament.\n\nAnd she was struggling to build support to undo the discretionary powers of the president to sack an elected government.\n\nThe ISI operation, codenamed Midnight Jackal, was revealed, and the move failed, but Bhutto couldn't undo the presidential powers.\n\nSo when she became pregnant she did not go public with the news and did not take maternity leave.\n\nIn fact, she had a quick Caesarean section performed by her gynaecologist and returned to work soon afterwards.\n\n\"The next day I was back on the job, reading government papers and signing government files,\" Bhutto later wrote.\n\n\"Only later did I learn that I was the only head of government in recorded history actually to give birth while in office.\n\n\"It was a defining moment, especially for young women, proving that a woman could work and have a baby in the highest and most challenging leadership positions.\""
