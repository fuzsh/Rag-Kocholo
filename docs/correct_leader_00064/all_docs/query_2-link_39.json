        "text": "Benazir Bhutto\n\nBenazir Bhutto (born 1953) became prime minister of Pakistan in 1988. Heir to the political legacy of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (prime minister from 1971 to 1977), she was the first woman in modern times to head the government of an Islamic state.\n\nBenazir Bhutto assumed the prime ministership of Pakistan after 11 years of struggle against the military regime of General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. She had taken up the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party— founded by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was deposed by General Zia in 1977 and executed in 1979. Over the following decade Bhutto mobilized opposition to the martial law regime, spending nearly six of those years in prison or detention. In a national election following the death of General Zia in August 1988, the People's Party won a plurality of seats in the National Assembly. Bhutto was invited by Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khah to form a government and was sworn in as prime minister on December 2, 1988.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was born in Karachi, Pakistan, on June 21, 1953. She received her early education in Pakistan. From 1969 to 1973 she attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she obtained a B.A. degree cum laude in comparative government. Between 1973 and 1977 Bhutto read politics, philosophy, and economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University. In December 1976 she was elected president of Oxford Union, becoming the first Asian woman to head the prestigious debating society.\n\nBhutto's plans to enter Pakistan's foreign service ended with the deposition of her father and a decision to dedicate herself to restoring a democratically-elected government. Despite lengthy periods of imprisonment and her self-exile in Europe beginning in January 1984, she directed the rebuilding and restructuring of the People's Party. She traveled widely, presenting the case against the Zia regime, attacking its violations of civil and human rights. In Pakistan, opponents of the regime defied the government's ban on political activity despite mass arrests and intimidation. While relentless in her criticism, Bhutto counseled her loyalists against any resort to armed confrontation, preferring instead to wrest power through the political process.\n\nMartial law ended December 30, 1985, but the civilian government that Zia, as president and army chief of staff, had installed three months earlier was based on nonparty elections. Hoping to revive the campaign for representative government, Bhutto returned to Pakistan in April 1986. Traveling across the country, she attracted crowds that rivaled any in Pakistan's history.\n\nOn May 29, 1988, President Zia abruptly dissolved the Parliament and dismissed his hand-picked but increasingly independent-minded prime minister, Mohammad Junejo. Fears that Zia would somehow keep the People's Party from contesting forthcoming elections were removed by his sudden death. Yet the People's Party's failure in the November election to win an outright parliamentary majority resulted in a politically vulnerable Bhutto-led coalition government. An alliance of opposition parties made it difficult for the prime minister to advance the kind of legislative program that had been promised to deal with the country's pressing problems. In particular, matters of social justice, including repeal of fundamentalist laws considered degrading to women, could not be enacted. It was politically expedient to avoid antagonizing religious elements, some of whom believed it \"un-Islamic\" for a woman to be the head of government. Faced with severe financial constraints, the prime minister also made little progress in bringing reforms to the education and health sectors or in curbing bureaucratic corruption.\n\nBhutto took care not to offend a military establishment which had allowed the return to a democratic system and refrained from direct interference in domestic politics. The army was appeased in the area of military spending and given wide latitude in formulating and implementing certain foreign and domestic policies, most notably Pakistan's role in orchestrating the Afghan war and terms for peace. Her government's dependence on the military increased with the outbreak of serious civil disorders and violence arising from persisting ethnic and regional antagonisms made more lethal by weapons siphoned off from the Afghan conflict.\n\nTo her credit, Bhutto released political prisoners and took other steps to restore fundamental human rights. Heavy restrictions on the press were lifted along with limitations on assembly by unions and student groups. She also gained stature for her success in outmaneuvering the combined opposition in its tactics to oust her from office. Unlike her father, who favored socialist rhetoric and nationalized many economic institutions and activities, Bhutto emphasized economic growth and argued for decreased government subsidies and greater privatization in the economy. During her tenure, the prime minister demonstrated considerable skill in winning international diplomatic and economic support for Pakistan and effectively used the Kashmir dispute with India to rally domestic public sentiment without unnecessarily inflaming it. Among Pakistan's leaders she was considered the most inclined to strive for improved relations with India.\n\nBhutto married Asif Ali Zardari on December 18, 1987. The son of a politically active, wealthy landowning family from the Sindh Province, Zardari's background was similar to that of his wife—not surprising since Bhutto acceded to a traditionally arranged marriage. They had two children.\n\nOn August 6, 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khah, apparently supported by the Pakistan military, suddenly dismissed Bhutto from the office of prime minister. Citing government corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power, Khah dissolved the National Assembly and declared a state of emergency. Bhutto called her dismissal \"illegal and unconstitutional\" and worried about the fate of her People's Party. The caretaker government continued its campaign against Bhutto by arresting her husband October 10, charging kidnapping, extortion, and loan fraud. In elections held on October 24 Bhutto's party suffered a major defeat. The victorious alliance named Nawaz Sharif, a conservative industrialist, to be prime minister.\n\nBhutto, vowing to seek office in elections to come, spent the next few years trying to regain support and political favor. She served as chairperson of the standing committee on foreign affairs of the National Assembly and was again elected to the position of prime minister of Pakistan in October 1993.\n\nIn November of 1996, Bhutto was again ousted from her post, this time by Farooq Leghari, the man she had chosen for president. Again accused of nepotism and corruption, Bhutto was placed under house arrest, though never officially charged with anything. Less than a year later, Bhutto again attempted to regain power.\n\nIn Pakistan's general elections in February 1997, Nawaz Sharif celebrated a landslide victory over Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) won a resounding 134 of 217 seats in the National Assembly while Bhutto saw the PPP reduced to a mere 19 seats and virtually erased from the key Punjab provincial assembly.\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine in March 1997, Bhutto said, \"If the elections had been fair, free, and impartial, the Pakistan People's Party would have won on the basis of the development work we have done, on the basis of restoring peace, of increasing education and health expenditures, bringing the deficit down, repaying debt and bringing peace to Karachi. The results were engineered…. The whole thing was a fraud for the people of Pakistan.\"\n\nIn her defeat, Bhutto said she no longer desired the prime minister's post. \"My father worked from morning to night. I worked from morning to night. My father, what did he get? He got hanged. What did I get? I got slandered,\" she said. \"Let there be a new leadership. I want my party to win the next elections, and I will help my party prepare to win. But I don't want to be prime minister.\"\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBenazir Bhutto is the author of two books, Foreign Policy in Perspective (1978) and her autobiography, Daughter of the East (1989). Several collections of her speeches and works have been compiled, including The Way Out (1988). Three books about Prime Minister Bhutto have been published in India: Benazir's Pakistan (1989), edited by M. D. Dharamdasani; The Trial of Benazir (1989), by Rafiq Zakaria; and Benazir Bhutto: Opportunities and Challenges (1989), by P. L. Bhola. The News International, a publication of the Jang Group, located at <http://www.jang.group.com>, gives up-to-date news of Pakistan's political climate. There is also a biography of Bhutto located on the World Wide Web entitledImran-net's Biography of Benazir Bhutto, which gives general background information on the ex-prime minister.\n\nUseful for an reader's appreciation of the difficulties facing a woman in political life is Women of Pakistan (1987), by Khawar Mumtaz and Farida Shaheed. Additionally, Emma Duncan's Breaking the Curfew (1989) presents a highly revealing picture of Pakistan's troubled political scene. □\n\nBenazir Bhutto\n\nBorn: June 21, 1953\n\nKarachi, Pakistan\n\nPakistani prime minister\n\nBenazir Bhutto became prime minister of Pakistan in 1988. She was the first woman in modern times to head the government of an Islamic state, and she followed her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who served as prime minister from 1971 to 1977.\n\nPolitical family\n\nBenazir Bhutto was born in Karachi, Pakistan, on June 21, 1953, the first of four children of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto. Benazir's parents were often away from home during her childhood on business related to her father's different jobs within the Pakistani government. Although the Bhutto family followed the Muslim religion, Benazir attended Catholic schools. She was also tutored at home in nonreligious subjects, the Muslim faith, and Arabic.\n\nBenazir Bhutto went to the United States when she was sixteen and attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she earned a degree in government. At this time she experienced quite a different culture from her Pakistani home. While she was at Cambridge, her father became prime minister of Pakistan. Between 1973 and 1977 Bhutto attended Oxford University in Oxford, England. In December 1976 she was elected president of Oxford Union, becoming the first Asian woman to head that famous debating society.\n\nVoice of democracy\n\nIn 1977 Zulfikar Bhutto was arrested and his government was taken over by General Zia ul-Haq (1924–1988), who declared martial law (the exercise of control by military officials over an area). Although many questioned the verdict, Benazir Bhutto's father was found guilty of plotting to kill a political opponent and was hanged in 1979. Bhutto decided to work to restore democracy to her country, although she and her mother were often arrested. She traveled widely, criticizing the Zia government for its violations of civil and human rights. Bhutto urged her supporters to avoid violence, preferring to gain power through the political process.\n\nMartial law ended in December 1985, but the government that Zia, as president and army chief of staff, had installed did not allow free elections. Hoping to revive the campaign for representative government, Bhutto returned to Pakistan in April 1986. She traveled across the country and attracted large crowds of supporters. Bhutto also married Asif Ali Zardari in December 1987. The son of a politically active and wealthy family, Zardari's background was similar to that of his wife—not surprising since it was a traditional arranged marriage. They had two children.\n\nBecomes prime minister\n\nAfter Zia died suddenly in August 1988, Bhutto led the People's Party to victory in elections held in November and became prime minister. It was difficult for her to make the kinds of changes she wanted, however. For example, she was unable to change laws that degraded women because she feared losing the support of religious groups, many of whom believed it was \"un-Islamic\" for a woman to be the head of government in the first place. She also had to be careful in dealing with the military, which she depended on to help control ethnic and regional disorders and violence in Pakistan. Bhutto also had little success in improving education and health care and in cleaning up government corruption (unlawful conduct).\n\nTo her credit Bhutto took steps to restore basic human rights. Restrictions on the press were lifted, and unions and student groups were allowed to gather freely. She also won respect by outsmarting her opponents in their attempts to oust her from office. Bhutto emphasized economic growth (increase in the production, distribution, and use of goods and services) and argued for less government influence in the economy. She also demonstrated skill in winning international support for Pakistan and sought improved relations with India.\n\nNo job security\n\nIn August 1990 President Ghulam Ishaq Khah, supported by the Pakistan military, dismissed Bhutto from office, claiming that her rule had been corrupt and had abused its power. Her husband was also arrested on several charges, including kidnapping. In elections soon afterward, Bhutto's party suffered a major defeat. Nawaz Sharif, a conservative (one who prefers to keep things as they are) businessman, was named prime minister. Bhutto vowed to return to office and spent the next few years trying to regain support. She was again elected as prime minister of Pakistan in October 1993.\n\nIn November 1996, however, Bhutto was ousted and accused of corruption for a second time by Farooq Leghari, the man she had chosen for president. After failing to regain power in elections held in February 1997, she claimed that the elections were fixed and said she no longer desired the prime minister's post. In April 1999 Bhutto was sentenced to five years in jail, banned from politics for five years, and fined $8.6 million on charges of corruption during her last term in office. Her husband received the same sentence. Bhutto maintained her innocence, and in April 2001 the Pakistani Supreme Court ordered new trials for both her and her husband.\n\nDespite the fact that Bhutto remained in exile from Pakistan, in autumn 2001 she traveled to India to campaign for a return to politics in her home country. At the time she planned to enter the race for prime minister of Pakistan in the October 2002 elections. In spring 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf (1943–) stated that Benazir Bhutto would not be allowed to become a candidate in the elections.\n\nBhutto continues to claim that she is innocent of corruption charges and remains involved in the politics of Pakistan as the leader of a Pakistani political group.\n\nFor More Information\n\nBhutto, Benazir.
