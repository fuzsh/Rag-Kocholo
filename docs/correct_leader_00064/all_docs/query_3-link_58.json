        "text": "We critically evaluated the political personality of Benazir Bhutto. In other words we tried to understand a new political trend that she introduced in Pakistani politics being first women Prime Minister as well as the short coming of her personality as a political leader. In this scenario Benazir Bhutto being young and first Prime Minister had too much to lose in her basket. She had to defend herself as a right choice by the people of Pakistan to the political fanatic as well as religious extremists who believed that elected regime of Benazir Bhutto was a mistake done by the people of Pakistan. Due to tremendous pressures on multiple posts due to the facts discussed above Benazir Bhutto’s government had done very little yet understandably decent in office, though no particular legislative steps were taken in practice in two years period. It looked that she had motives and will to do number of things but her government management lacked proper planning and scheming to tackle the tasks. She notable addressed number of issues in the parliament specially her strong will and intention to repeal the so called Hadood laws which were targeted by number of Muslim scholars as against the original understanding and rules or Shariah law as few of them were wrongly interpreted and corporate into the legislative system. But she took on practical steps to correct the flaws. In her parliamentary speeches as well as on international forums she kept speaking against the prisoner situation in the jails of Pakistan as she has also went through the agony of this system, but no corrective legislation was implemented except over 1000 political prisoner were freed from the jails. When it came to freedom of expression and liberties she had a very clear stance on them. For the very reason television and news mediums were given free walk across not only this but also ban on student unions and labour unions were lifted. It was in some ways the effect of Pakistan’s economic and financial situation also that she lacked funds to bring more effective and practical plans in action. In this regard it should not be ignored that when she took over the office of Prime Minister of Pakistan was at the verge of Bankruptcy and Pakistani administration had to made special compromises as to avail more loan to pay the previous loan. Intended for almost a decade Benazir Bhutto has been the most vibrant, energetic, and forceful parliamentarian in Pakistan. She was to some extent controversial hitherto admired political director in Pakistan. For the duration of a decade from 1986 almost till 1999 she has been on the center stage of politics in Pakistan, either inside or away of prime ministerial command, she demonstrated guts, nerve and mind in tackling martial law and in the course of action to facilitate a democratic and elected government. From the beginning to end of the elections she contested in 1988 till 1999, she portrayed the reflection of a leader who believed in and was developmental, futuristic, and judicious but with an independent temperament, sound equipped in varying comprehensive authenticity and aspirant to renovate Pakistan into an economically urbanized, autonomous, collectively broadminded, contemporary nation. Benazir Bhutto’s parliamentary skill of crowd enlistment and administrative altercation were proven to be far superior then her counter parts. She has been efficient and dexterous as a leader of the opposition, as compared to her tenure in prime minister’s office. She displayed her dedication to progressive ethics as a parliamentarian. In her biography she come into sight as an individual who was worn to shreds and stuck between the democratic and moderate model that she learned in oxford and Harvard and a tyrannical truth that she was practically living in Pakistan. In spite of the being deficient in practical legislative accomplishments including not being able to manage and gathering proper funds for the projects she was very speaking very active about in the parliament, her attractiveness, fame and recognition in the midst of the nation lingered solid. Benazir Bhutto was upholding the fragile sense of balance inside the realm, tiresomely acting to conciliate and bring as much positivity as was achievable. For this purpose there was nothing in bag for Benazir Bhutto known as trouble-free approach to achieve the desired. Prime Minister Bhutto's efforts at sustaining a sense of balance amid the splinter group in the country assembled through diverse consequences. Seeing that in every following circumstance, every bloc exercised its individual thoughts concerning how matters were taken care of and were done. The two for the most part stern and stem antagonism sections opposing her in and outside the parliament were the religious fundamentalist and Nawaz Sharif who at that time was heading the regional administration of Province Punjab, which had largest number of army personals led by Zia regime. Both hardened their aptitude of hostility towards newly elected Prime Minister. The functioning and mood of these elements was in no likelihood of supporting to build up a wounded country that was threatened with the possibilities of economic default but to make people of Pakistan realize what a big mistake they have done by electing a woman as their leader. As the majority conventional amongst the religious influential, went consequently very remote by maintaining and declaring that a female, in Shariah commandment had no standing and eligibility of escorting Pakistan as head of state. Standing and maintaining her stance in such conditions, on whole as a parliamentarian was the big achievement by Benazir Bhutto. She stands and stance was accepted and acknowledged internationally for being an examplenary parliamentarian internationally. She was acknowledged as a leader who helped Pakistan through its fight back to bring democracy, basic human rights and a democratic government back in the country. Her parliamentary popularity and acceptance can be imagined that when she visited United States in 1989, Twenty-five thousand people stood in the rain to eavesdrop to this 1973 graduate of Harvard. She was indeed a great woman, the great parliamentary leader and the courageous democrat (May her soul rest in peace).\n\nPakistan has been a victim of leadership crisis throughout its history of seven decades. This crisis owes its origin and development mainly to over development of non-representative institutions of civil and military bureaucracy and recurrent experience of military authoritarian regimes. In such a restrictive political atmosphere there rose to the political scene a leader who had will, guts and popular acclaim to challenge Ayub Khan when Ayub's grip on power was yet firm. This leader was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who established his political party—Pakistan People's Party—and developed it into a mass movement during the anti-Ayub campaign which culminated into the downfall of Ayub and his resignation from power in 1969. Bhutto gave his nascent party new heights and was able to successfully contest elections of 1970 with securing 81 National Assembly seats but all from the West Pakistan. The party that won 1970 elections was the Pakistan Awami League which got overall simple majority but almost all seats from East Pakistan (160 out of 162). However, the crisis of transfer of power deepened when Yahya Khan showed unwillingness to transfer power and the political movement in East Pakistan developed into a separatist movement culminating into secession of East Pakistan in December 1971. The Pakistan People's Party, in comparison to Awami League, was a new entrant but its meteoric rise was, in fact, due to the charisma of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who galvanized the party and achieved stunning success. However, Bhutto's downfall was also as meteoric as was his rise. There were many factors but his political behaviour—the way he exercised power— contributed enormously in his downfall. This article outlines, first, his formative influences and the process through which he assumed leadership role and was able to leave an indelible imprint on the history of country. Second, while in power he carried out reforms not only those he had pledged in his election manifesto but more: in this way he resorted to broaden his powerbase in transactional and transformational leadership paradigm. Third, having entrenched himself in the power spectrum of Pakistan he started behaving like a typical Sindhi wadera. He resorted to exercising power in a very arbitrary manner and this political behavior, the details of which ensue in this paper, explains his downfall and ouster from power. Formative Influences: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto \" s downfall was as meteoric as was his rise to power. He stemmed from feudalistic social structure and imbibed feudal idiosyncratic"
