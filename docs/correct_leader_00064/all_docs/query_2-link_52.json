        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAseefa Bhutto-Zardari, youngest daughter of late former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, began her political career by taking oath as a Member of Parliament in the National Assembly. She won uncontested from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, a seat previously held by her father, Asif Ali Zardari. Speaker Ayaz Sadiq administered her oath amidst applause from PPP lawmakers.\n\nAseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the youngest daughter of slain former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, on Monday formally launched her political career after taking oath as a Member of Parliament. She was elected unopposed as a member of the National Assembly last month from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad (formerly Nawabshah) area of her native Sindh province. The seat was vacated by her father Asif Ali Zardari after he was elected as the President.\n\nSpeaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq administered the oath of office to Aseefa, 31, amidst applause from her Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) lawmakers.\n\nThe X account of PPP posted a photo of President Zardari with his daughter and wrote, \"President @AAliZardari congratulating Bibi @AseefaBZ on taking oath as Member of the National Assembly, in Islamabad.\"\n\nIn a related development, her victory was challenged in the Sindh High Court by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-backed independent candidate Ghulam Mustafa Rind who named the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Aseefa as respondents.\n\nThe petitioner backed by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's party claimed that he was not allowed to contest the polls and his nomination papers were wrongly rejected.\n\n\"I was told that I didn't submit the electricity bill when our village doesn't even have electricity. When I went to collect the bill, I was detained by the police,\" the petitioner claimed.\n\nRind implored the court to overturn Aseefa's unopposed victory and reinstate the democratic process.\n\nAseefa holds a bachelor's degree in politics and sociology and a master's in global health and development. She initially served as a goodwill ambassador for polio eradication in 2012 which made her face familiar among masses.\n\nHer father, President Zardari, had announced plans to make Aseefa the first lady of the country.\n\nShe is one of the three siblings of former two-time premier Benazir who was assassinated during an election rally in 2007. Aseefa is quite popular with the PPP supporters due to her close resemblance with her mother.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
