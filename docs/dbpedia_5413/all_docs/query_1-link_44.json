Even members of the band thought it was probably over. \"There is a faint chance we'll continue,\" Peter Tork told Rolling Stone. \"I don't know whether we could structure something without Davy. I had a couple of thoughts, but I don't know if they're workable.\"\n\nWhat he didn't count on at the time was former Monkee Michael Nesmith returning to the fold. With the exception of a short European run of dates in 1997, Nesmith hasn't participated in any of the Monkees many reunion tours since their split in 1971.\n\nAs Rolling Stone announced this morning, he's had a change of heart and the three surviving members of the band will hit the road in November. We spoke with Nesmith via e-mail about the reunion tour and his other future plans.\n\nWhen I spoke with Peter and Micky shortly after Davy died, they said they hadn't really spoken to you since the 1997 European tour. Where and when did you guys first begin communicating?\n\nWe reconnected at a private memorial for David the three of us arranged that was held at a private home.\n\nWhat made you want to return to the band after all these years? Is this something you'd been contemplating for a while?\n\nI never really left. It is a part of my youth that is always active in my thought and part of my overall work as an artist. It stays in a special place, but like things in the past it fades in and out in relevance to activities that are current. Getting together with old friends and acquaintances can be very stimulating and fun and even inspiring to me. We did some good work together and I am always interested in the right time and the right place to reconnect and play.\n\nAny regrets about not joining them on their tour last year? Were you ever tempted to guest for a song or two last year?\n\nNo. It was, as usual, a question of schedules and timing and the focus of our individual work. Had there been an opportunity to join them I would have – but we were out of sync schedule wise.\n\nHow will the show address Davy's absence? Will songs he originally sang be included?\n\nDavid's presence and his past will be throughout the show. He will be missed in his absence, but very much on our minds and in our heart. We will include some of the songs he sang, and do our best.\n\nWhat sort of setlist can fans expect? Are there certain rarities you're hoping to bring back? Has the band been assembled yet?\n\nWe are focusing around Headquarters – our first real sojourn as a band – but the setlist will include all the Monkees fans expect. There are songs of mine and Peter's that have not been performed that we will play. The three of us will play the Headquarters material as we did in the studio – but the shows backing band for the other material will be the same as the last tours – with the exception of the inclusion of my son Christian on guitar.\n\nIs there any talk of recording new material?\n\nNo.\n\nAre you interested in continuing with the group after this string of dates ends in December?\n\nContinuing is a big word. If you mean receptive to more concert dates, as I say I am always interested – but much will depend on the logic of events.\n\nI've heard you might go on a solo tour and perform material from your RCA albums. Is that the case? If so, when might that happen?\n\nYes. But more than the RCA albums. There is a lot of material around later work in video that is fun to play as well. I am doing a short four-concert tour in October in the U.K. And I am looking at a longer solo tour in the States in the spring of '13.\n\nI also heard you want to write a book. What are the plans for that?\n\nI am in that process. This will be my third book – the first two are novels and this will be a type of nonfiction. I use \"type\" as an equivocator since there is some fiction in it. It is more amarcord than autobiography, more a study of events past in my life and times and how they fit together than a recollection. Vidal made the distinction in his book Palimpsest between the memoir and the autobiography – and that's a good definition for this new book – a kind of memoir – and Tropic of Cancer is another good way to look at the mixture of true stories and fictionally enhanced but real events. (Not to presume to compare myself with Miller or Vidal.) No publisher yet.\n\nFans haven't heard much from you in a very long time. Now there's all these projects seemingly at once. What's the impetus for all this?\n\nI feel this is the start of the ending for me here – or more precisely, as Churchill had it – the end of the beginning. Now is the time.\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/n...ing-return-to-the-monkees-20120808?print=true\n\n[h=3]They don't worry about their place in rock history. Besides, they're too busy singing on their reunion tour.[/h]By Randy Lewis, Los Angeles Times\n\n4:18 PM PST, November 9, 2012\n\nThe Monkees haven't toured together in more than four decades, so it seemed only logical that at a rehearsal this week in North Hollywood, the band's three surviving members might not be in sync.\n\nBut two days ahead of a short reunion tour that began Thursday in Escondido, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork communicated in a secret language as if it were still 1969.\n\nIn the middle of a long jam, Nesmith, 69, took his hands off his vintage-style Gretsch guitar and began addressing Dolenz in an elaborate sequence of arm and hand signals (think of ground crew guiding a plane in at LAX). Dolenz, 67, quickly answered in similar body language from behind his gold metal-flake drum kit. Tork smiled.\n\nNesmith, who hasn't taken part in a full-fledged U.S. tour with the other Monkees since 1969, then translated. \"This means,\" he said haltingly as he continued gesturing, \"chili … dog … with … cheese.\"\n\nYou can take the man out of the Monkees, but … well, you know where this is going.\n\nHumor is a key element in the camaraderie among these men, who along with the late singer Davy Jones vaulted to fame in 1966 with their hit TV show \"The Monkees\" and the string of recordings they made for each week's episode. Even though they were originally hired to portray a zany famous rock band on TV, the songs made bona-fide pop stars out of the four amateur actors-musicians.\n\nFollowing their first run-through of the whole set at a dress rehearsal Wednesday in Escondido, Nesmith exhibited genuine curiosity, and a little nervousness, when he asked a visitor how the show would come across: \"Do you think Monkees' fans will like it?\"\n\nNesmith has reason to question how they'll be received since the band will be touring without one of its lead singers, who was the British heartthrob of the band in the TV series. The reunion tour, which plays the Greek Theatre on Saturday, follows Jones' death this year of a heart attack. He'd toured periodically with Dolenz and Tork since the Monkees released their final album in 1970 and is being saluted in this round of shows through photos, film footage and recordings of some of his songs.\n\n\"Of course we miss Davy,\" Tork, 70, said, \"and it's sad to be playing without him. But when Davy, Micky and I were touring, it was sad to play without Mike.\"\n\nOver the years Nesmith skipped most of the Monkees reunions, citing commitments related to his solo career — including running the Pacific Arts music and video label he launched in the '70s, producing films (including \"Repo Man\") and writing two novels. (Nesmith trivia: He produced music videos for Lionel Richie's 1983 single \"All Night Long (All Night)\" and Michael Jackson's 1987 hit \"The Way You Make Me Feel.\")\n\nBut behind the scenes, Jones made remarks during the '97 British tour that hinted at tension with Nesmith, and the 2011 Monkees tour ended prematurely because of reported disagreements Dolenz and Tork had with Jones regarding business facets of the tour.\n\nThat's all water under the bridge. \"This show, it's not about a loss, it's not a memorial,\" Nesmith said. \"It's acknowledging the gain and the contribution that David made. At this time of our lives, we don't have illusions about what this is: It's about the good work we did.\"\n\nThe Monkees' career lasted barely four years but yielded four No. 1 albums, half a dozen Top 10 singles, three of which reached No. 1, a TV series that's become a comedy classic that still airs around the world and the avant-garde 1968 film, \"Head,\" which reflected the anarchic zeitgeist of the late-'60s while satirically relating the story of the Monkees' rise from creative puppets to masters of their own fate.\n\n\"There's no other story like it in entertainment,\" said music historian Andrew Sandoval, author of the 2005 career diary \"The Monkees.\" \"They released their first single in August 1966, the show premiered in September, and by January they'd won their fight for artistic control. It's as if the contestants on 'American Idol' came in one day and said, 'Fire the judges and the producers, we're taking over.' \"\n\nThat refers to the famous showdown between the Monkees — with Nesmith leading the charge — and music world impresario Don Kirshner, who controlled the music the group recorded, largely from his bevy of esteemed Brill Building songwriters including Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, and Neil Diamond.\n\nKirshner also had an authoritarian hand over how the band's records were made and packaged. The contributions of ace Hollywood studio musicians who played most of the music on the group's first two albums, \"The Monkees\" and \"More of the Monkees,\" went largely uncredited, creating the impression that all the music was played by Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith and Tork.\n\n\"When they handed me the second album and there were no musician credits on it, I started to smell a rat,\" Nesmith said. \"My position was, 'If you don't need me for this. Replace me. Tell people, \"Michael died. Here's the new guy, his name isn't Michael, it's Bubba.\" ' But the reaction was, 'No, you're right, there is something good here.' That's where the [1968 film] 'Head' came from.\n\n\"We thought it was a huge victory,\" he said. \"It was hard fought and it was brutal but it was worth it.... We came up against a corporate monster and just said no — and not in the Reagan-era sense of the word. In that sense, people recognized we don't need to be making stuff up. If you look at what we're actually doing, it takes your breath away.\"\n\nThat bit of pop history will underscore this tour, a portion of which will be devoted to their third album, 1967's \"Headquarters,\" the first after the battle the led to Kirshner's ousting.\n\n\"It's the first album we were the musicians on, the first which we had creative control over,\" said Tork, who performs and records with his own band, Shoe Suede Blues, when he's not occupied with Monkees business, while Dolenz has kept active in musical theater and recently released a new solo album, \"Remember.\" \"We were very pleased with ourselves — rightly or wrongly — with that album.\"\n\nThe reunion show also will include all the songs from \"Head,\" the experimental film written by Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson.\n\nToday the Monkees have no shortage of fans, and not all of them are boomers. The TV show went into syndication in the 1970s, then became a major hit with a new generation at the dawn of MTV, which ran episodes three times a day in the 1980s, leading to a major Monkees revival. Their original studio albums were reissued and returned the group to the Billboard charts two decades after it formed.\n\nNesmith, a pioneer of video music who received the first music video Grammy Award 20 years ago, recently set Monkees fans abuzz when he wrote on his Facebook page that Jimmy Fallon was begging to sing \"Daydream Believer\" in Jones' place on the upcoming tour, then subsequently teased that Kevin Spacey was lobbying for the job.\n\n\"I think I was just channeling Mike of the Monkees, reconnecting with his impish self,\" he said. \"I started to see from the feedback of [fans] responding to the notion about who should sing 'Daydream Believer' where it fit into so many people's lives.\"\n\nBut of the fans who bemoan that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has never inducted the Monkees, group members aren't among them. \"It's their museum [and] I don't feel the least bit slighted, or snubbed in any way,\" said Nesmith, the Texas-born musician famous for his green knit beanie and who was originally pigeonholed as \"the smart Monkee.\"\n\n\"The Monkees will be wherever they belong — I have a lot of confidence in that because of where we have popped up, in the right places, over time,\" Nesmith said. \"Put the Monkees in the Smithsonian if you want to do something worthwhile in terms of memorializing the band's place in the culture.\"\n\nBack in the day the Monkees' legitimacy was often questioned by those out of grade school, but it was never an issue for the band they were partly modeled after, the Beatles.\n\n\"The Beatles always got the whole Monkee thing,\" Dolenz said, adopting a Liverpudlian accent to quote John Lennon: \"It was John who was the first one to say, 'It's like the Marx Brothers.'\"\n\n\"The Monkees were in the mix with most of the lions of rock 'n' roll,\" Nesmith said, \"but we got there by special permission because of the TV show. None of us are fooling ourselves into thinking we are one of the great classic-rock bands. We are kind of an iconic garage band, sort of the inmates taking over the asylum, and we have a lot of fun.\"\n\nby Denise Crosby Aurora Beacon-News February 20, 2017\n\nFermilab Scientist Herman White and Assistant Director for Communications Katie Yurkewicz show Micky Dolenz the 15th floor of Wilson Hall during a tour of the lab in Batavia. (Fermilab / Handout)\n\nAs you can imagine, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory gets lots of really smart visitors to its Batavia site, among them high-ranking politicians and some of the world's top scientists, including Nobel Prize winners.\n\nBut Fermilab staff members were so excited about last week's guest, many of them were standing in the conference room looking out the big window to the entrance as they anxiously awaited the arrival of &#8230; 1960s pop star Micky Dolenz.\n\nWhen it comes to celebrity fandom, those physicists aren't monkeying around.\n\nDolenz &#8212; an actor, musician and director best known for his gig with the iconic group the Monkees on TV &#8212; contacted Fermilab archivist Valerie Higgins back in November about taking a tour of the facility.\n\nTurns out the multitalented entertainer has been a physics geek since middle school when a teacher ignited his passion for the subject. And he had visited the Batavia lab in 1970, while starring in a play at Pheasant Run Playhouse, when the gigantic accelerator tunnel was first being built.\n\nThe reason for this recent call: He was giving a concert in St. Charles and wanted to know if he could donate the 16mm film he'd taken from that tour nearly 50 years ago, as well as drop by for another visit.\n\nHiggins, of course, was more than ready to roll out the red carpet. Only 30, she's far too young to have watched the television show featuring the Monkees in their prime &#8212; it only ran from 1966 to '68 &#8212; but knew all the songs from the records her mom had kept over the years.\n\nPerhaps even more excited was Fermilab senior scientist Adam Lyon, who is associate division head for systems for scientific applications.\n\n<aside class=\"trb_ar_sponsoredmod\" data-adloader-networktype=\"yieldmo\" data-v-ymid=\"ym_1606461062581172542\" data-role=\"delayload_item\" data-withinviewport-options=\"bottomOffset=100\" data-load-method=\"trb.vendor.yieldmo.init\" data-load-type=\"method\"> </aside>Just typing that title tells me I'm in way over my head interviewing this guy. Thankfully, the very personable Lyon and I talked mostly about his own Monkees fandom. Now 47, he said he grew up watching the successful pop group in syndication, and, it turned out, his wife, Caryn, is a huge fan from watching the Monkees on MTV in college.\n\nEven after learning about Dolenz's interest in physics, Lyon and Higgins both were \"blown away\" by the amount of knowledge Dolenz knew as they and other Fermilab staff gave their guest a four-hour tour of the facility. That included the Main Ring: the original four-mile-round particle accelerator ring Dolenz saw being built in 1970.\n\nAccording to Lyon, Fermilab stopped using the Main Ring in 1997 and built a new accelerator in a new tunnel to feed particles into the Tevatron. Still, much of the Main Ring is intact with many magnets still in place.\n\nDolenz also got a tour of the remote operations center, the DZero and Tevatron, the MC1 building and Muon g-2 Experiment, and toured the MINOS underground neutrino area. And throughout the day, even surrounded by some of the brightest people in the world, he \"held his own,\" said Higgins, which delighted those really high-IQ folks to no end.\n\nBut their guest, she added, also was excited that he could talk to people about particle physics, as he described it, \"without their eyes glazing over.\"\n\nDespite having a concert the next day, Dolenz joined a group of scientists for a TGIF gathering at the on-site pub, staying until 10 p.m. conversing with physicists about such topics as the gravitational wave discovery, the Higgs Particle and the large Hadron Collider.\n\n\"It was clear he was just so happy to be in a room where everyone understood physics,\" said Higgins.\n\n\"I've been a fan of particle physics for my whole life. My first email address back in the early'90s was Higgs137,\" Dolenz said later in an interview with Fermilab staff.\n\nOf course the rest of us have no idea what that means, but it turns out he's referring to both the Higgs boson and the number of the fine structure constant, a number former Fermilab Director Leon Lederman observed as one of the most recurring in physics.\n\nI, for one, still don't know what that means &#8212; but I'm happy to report that, even after all that smart talk, Fermilab hosts could still see the other side of the Monkee known as the goofy one.\n\n\"He was playful, funny, friendly and eager,\" noted Higgins, \"but also very intelligent.\"\n\ndcrosby@tribpub.com\n\nBy Andy Greene | February 20, 2018 | Rolling Stone\n\nThe Monkees' Michael Nesmith and Micky Dolenz are hitting the road in June for their first-ever tour as a duo. They're calling the tour The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show (as opposed to simply \"The Monkees\") because their fellow surviving bandmate Peter Tork is not participating. Though the set centers around the classic group's vast catalog, Nesmith and Dolenz plan to roll out deep cuts and rarities.\n\n\"It will be very different than a Monkees show,\" Nesmith told Rolling Stone in January. \"I mean, it'll be Monkees music, but there's no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees. We're not. We're the remnants.\"\n\nThe Monkees reformed in 1986 shortly after MTV put their old television show into heavy rotation, earning them an entirely new generation of fans. With the sole exception of a brief fun of U.K. show in 1996, Michael Nesmith didn't participate in any of the reunion tours. Shortly after the death of Davy Jones, however, he stunned fans by returning to the group for three consecutive summer tours. He participated in their 50th anniversary LP Good Times! in 2016, but he stepped away from their touring outfit, leaving Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork to continue as a duo.\n\nOn September 16th, 2016 Nesmith - who resurrected his early 1970s country rock band the First National Band in early 2018 - played a show with the group at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles that was billed as a farewell to \"Monkee Mike.\" He doesn't view this tour as a reversal of that decision. \"This isn't Monkee Michael and Monkee Micky going out,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"[But] we're using the Monkees logo and name to promote it.\"\n\nPeter Tork explained in a press release that he was skipping the tour to focus on his upcoming Lead Belly tribute album, Relax Your Mind. \"I have in general made no secret of the fact that all these recent years of Monkees-related projects, as fun as they’ve been, have taken up a lot of my time and energy,\" he said. \"Moving forward, I have blues projects that I want to give my attention to, hence Relax Your Mind. So, I'm shifting gears for now, but I wish the boys well, and I've learned to never say never on things further down the line.\"\n\nNesmth also hinted that there might be slightly more to Tork's decision than the need to focus the Lead Belly album. \"I'm afraid I would betray a confidence if I said any more than, 'This is not a right time for him,'\" he told Rolling Stone. \"He has his reasons. They are very private.\"\n\nEven without Tork, the tour will be a great chance for Monkees fans to see Dolenz and Nesmith explore parts of the catalog that past tours have neglected. \"These 16 special performances will feature songs that span the group's entire career – from its 1966 eponymous debut to 2016’s Good Times,\" reads the press release. \"The shows will highlight many of Nesmith's compositions, including some that have never been performed live.\"\n\n\"I love being onstage with Micky,\" Nesmith says in a statement. \"We've been collaborating for over 50 years, so it's hard to believe it’s never been just the two of us. I'm excited to dust off some tunes that I haven’t played for a long time too.\"\n\nDolenz concurs. \"Right from the get-go, I admired Mike's songs,\" he said in a statement. \"When we used to get together around the campfire to sing in the early days, we were always doing his songs. We always had such a great a vocal blend; he was the one who encouraged me to write songs of my own. I've always been a big fan and now we finally get to do the Mike & Micky show that we riffed on back when we were shooting The Monkees.\"\n\nMicky Dolenz, Mike Nesmith Tour Dates\n\nJune 1 - Chandler, AZ @ Chandler Center For The Arts\n\nJune 2 - Los Angeles, CA @ The Orpheum\n\nJune 3 - San Diego, CA @ Humphrey’s\n\nJune 5 - Anaheim, CA @ The Grove\n\nJune 6 - Saratoga, CA @ The Mountain Winery\n\nJune 8 - Stockton, CA @ Bob Hope Theatre\n\nJune 9 - Stateline, NV @ Harrah's Lake Tahoe\n\nJune 12 - Denver, CO @ Paramount\n\nJune 14 - Chicago, IL @ Copernicus Center\n\nJune 15 - Huber Heights, OH @ Rose Music Center\n\nJune 16 - Cleveland, OH @ Cain Park\n\nJune 18 - Toronto, ON @ Sony Center\n\nJune 19 - Kitchener, ON @ Centre In the Square\n\nJune 21 - Philadelphia, PA @ Keswick Theatre\n\nJune 22 - New York, NY @ Beacon Theatre\n\nJune 25 - Red Bank, NJ @ Count Basie Theatre\n\nby Andy Greene October 10, 2018 Rolling Stone\n\nTwo years ago, the Monkees stunned a lot of people — especially themselves — when their 50th anniversary album Good Times! hit Number 14 on the Billboard 200 and earned them some of the best reviews of their entire career. There was a lot of talk about a followup, but nobody could agree on what direction to take. “We really caught lightning in a bottle with Good Times!,” says singer Micky Dolenz. “I remember people asking about a Good Times! 2, but that didn’t fire me up. It felt too risky to try doing that again.”\n\nBut then Rhino threw out the idea of a Monkees Christmas album, which the group somehow never did during their Sixties heyday or at any of their many reunions. Once Good Times! producer Adam Schlesinger signed on to project and everyone from Rivers Cuomo to XTC’s Andy Partridge, R.E.M.’s Peter Buck and even novelist Michael Chabon agreed to write songs, the idea became just too good to pass up. “It all came together so fast,” says Dolenz. “You have no idea.”\n\nChristmas Party (out Friday) is a mixture of new songs, like the Rivers Cuomo–penned “What Would Santa Do” and Andy Partridge’s “Unwrap You at Christmas” (which you can hear below) and classics like Paul McCartney’s “Wonderful Christmastime” and “Silver Bells.” There’s also a few left field takes like Alex Chilton’s “Jesus Christ.” Dolenz sings lead on the majority of the songs, but Michael Nesmith tackles “The Christmas Song” and “Snowfall.” “He didn’t want to write a Christmas song,” says Dolenz. “But when he heard about the project he went, ‘Hmmm. I think I’d like to do a couple of classics.'”\n\n[video=youtube;Jii6VtvY73o]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jii6VtvY73o[/video]\n\nThere are also two songs (“Silver Bells” and “Mele Kalikimaka”) that feature the late Davy Jones on lead vocals. They were recorded many years ago when he created his own Christmas album, though new instrumentation has been paired with his original vocals. “The originals weren’t even full-blown recordings,” says Dolenz. “They were demos, but thank goodness they had good, clean vocals.”\n\nPerhaps the most interesting song on the album is “House of Broken Gingerbread,” which Schlesinger wrote with Michael Chabon. The lyrics describe a surreal scene at a Christmas celebration where “mistletoe is hanging by a thread” and “the misfit toys just shake their head.” “Boy,” says Dolenz. “What crazy lyrics!”\n\nPeter Tork didn’t participate in the last Monkees tour and hasn’t been seen much in public over the past year. His sole contribution to the record is a banjo-driven rendition of “Angels We Have Heard On High.” “I love the fact that he put banjo on a Christmas song,” says Dolenz. “He’s had his health issues and we’re sending him good wishes.”\n\nThe album wraps up with a bluesy rendition of “Merry Christmas Baby” with Dolenz on lead vocals. “I hope I wasn’t kidding myself when I did that,” he says. “My pre-Monkees roots were Otis Redding, Fats Domino and Little Richard. I wear that hat on that song. I just didn’t want to embarrass myself.”\n\nThere are no plans to promote Christmas Party with any sort of live work, but Dolenz and Nesmith are returning to the road in March to play the four dates they had to postpone this year when Nez underwent quadruple bypass surgery. “Nobody knew, especially him, what was wrong and how bad it was,” says Dolenz. “The tour might have helped save him because if he’d just been sitting home watching TV, he might not have noticed how sick he was.”\n\nGearing up the Monkees machine for a mere four dates seems like a lot of work, but Dolenz says there’s “definitely a possibility” they’ll add on more shows to the itinerary. For now, though, he’s just happy that Nesmith is back in good health. “When I saw him again a few weeks back it was pretty emotional,” he says. “We’re really like brothers in that there’s so much unspoken and understood that can be said with just a glance.”\n\nHe’s also still in shock that the Monkees are still releasing new music after all these years and there’s actually an audience for it. “It’s just crazy,” says Dolenz. “The equivalent to Good Times! going Top 20 would have been someone like [Italian opera star] Enrico Caruso, who was popular in 1917, having a Top 20 record in 1967.”\n\nBy Chris Morris November 2, 2018 Variety\n\nThe rough, sometimes druggy genesis of the American independent movie business of the ‘60s and ‘70s was recalled by Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees during a sold-out 50th anniversary American Cinematheque screening of the band’s ill-fated feature film “Head.”\n\nLooking out into the Egyptian Theatre before the film unspooled, Dolenz drolly asked one audience member, “You’ve seen it? Can you tell me what it’s about?”\n\nThe evening was hosted by the Monkees’ Boswell, producer Andrew Sandoval, who asked for a show of hands of how many in the crowd were returning “Head” cultists and how many were seeing it for the first time. The 60 percent or so making return trips were hugely enthusiastic, but Sandoval wasn’t making any promises to the 40 percent newbies, warning dryly, “We’ll see how many of you are here when we’re done.”\n\nRelentlessly post-modern and lacking anything even vaguely resembling a conventional plotline, “Head” was the feature debut of director-writer Bob Rafelson, who co-wrote the film with then 31-year-old Jack Nicholson. Rafelson and creative partner Bert Schneider’s company Raybert had produced the hit NBC series “The Monkees,” which made stars of its fictitious, fabricated “rock band” — Dolenz, Nesmith, Peter Tork and David “Davy” Jones. (Ten years ago this month, Tork and Jones came to the same theater for a 40th anniversary screening, so now every member of the Monkees has been to the Egyptian to defend — or just share bemusement about — the movie.)\n\nUsing every au courant film technique at their disposal, the production team created a determinedly non-linear film that played further tricks with the already self-referential, self-parodying roles familiar to viewers of the Monkees’ Beatles-inspired show. It made for head-spinning moviemaking — and it also utterly confused, perplexed and alienated the group’s young fans, and maybe even its stars.\n\nReleased months after the cancellation of “The Monkees” by NBC, “Head” brought the band’s two-year run as a hit-making machine to an abrupt halt. Moreover, the film itself was a colossal, virtually unseen flop that essentially ended the quartet’s career. However, like all things Monkees, it was ultimately embraced in later decades by the Pre-Fab Four’s cable-bred latter-day cult.\n\nViewed today, “Head” plays at dizzying and somewhat fatiguing speed. The film careens from one parody to another, spoofing Westerns, prize-fighting pictures, science fiction and, most notably, war movies (as the film was shot at the height of the Vietnam conflict). Its quick-cut visual bombardment employed color-blasting solarization, multiple exposures, jazzy optical printing, vault footage (from Rita Hayworth in “Gilda” to TV car salesman Ralph Williams) and a live concert sequence shot in Salt Lake City.\n\nThough music seldom gets in the way of its antic shape-shifting, “Head” sports a couple of wonderful song sequences: a brightly solarized rendering of Gerry Goffin and Carole King’s “Porpoise Song,” shot underwater in the Bahamas, and Jones’ show-stopping song-and-dance reading of Harry Nilsson’s poignant “Daddy’s Song,” performed with the film’s choreographer Toni Basil.\n\nFollowing the picture’s conclusion, Nesmith and Dolenz returned to the dais, with the latter quipping in mock relief, “I’m so glad none of you left — or at least not many.”\n\nThe musicians noted that the style of “Head,” and in fact the entire emerging creative scene in Hollywood during the late ‘60s, centered around youthful, hip talents — Nicholson, actor Harry Dean Stanton, artist Ed Ruscha — who were then just beginning to garner attention. Nicholson, previously best known for his work on Roger Corman’s exploitation films for American-International Pictures, was “the king of those guys,” Nesmith noted.\n\n“Along came these young bucks,” Dolenz recalled, referring to such talents as Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper (whose huge 1969 biker hit “Easy Rider” would be released through Raybert). This new generation of directors, writers and actors were intent on “breaking down the old traditional Hollywood paradigm.”\n\nBoth Rafelson and Schneider had family roots in Old Hollywood: The former was the nephew of Ernst Lubitsch’s screenwriter Samson Raphaelson, while the latter was the son of Abraham Schneider, who succeeded Harry Cohn as the head of Columbia Pictures. The younger Schneider took a radical route, winning a 1975 Academy Award as the producer of “Hearts and Minds,” Peter Davis’ Vietnam War documentary.\n\nNesmith noted that the use in “Head” of a notorious and shocking piece of Vietnam news footage — General Nguyen Ngoc Loan’s summary execution of a Viet Cong prisoner on a Saigon street in early ’68 — upset him so much that he couldn’t watch the rest of the film at an early screening. But Schneider was insistent on using the scene, telling the musician, “No, it’s anti-war, and it’ll have a big effect on the war.”\n\n“Bert was very politically motivated and very left-wing,” Dolenz said, while Sandoval added bluntly, “Bert and Bob were both provocateurs.”\n\nNew ideas called for new techniques, both Nesmith and Dolenz noted. When the script for “Head” was being developed, the Monkees spent some time in Ojai, tossing ideas around with Nicholson and Rafelson. “We stayed pretty stacked up that whole weekend,” Nesmith recalled. “Rafelson said, ‘We’ll just riff.’ Nicholson was the king of riffing… He kept us all really high.”\n\n“Jack came over to the house a number of times…[and] talked and smoked a bit,” Dolenz remembered. “He was getting insight into our personalities.”\n\nYet, in the end, despite significant creative input from the Monkees, Dolenz admitted, “I’m not sure what it’s all about… I don’t know exactly what Bob and Bert had in mind.”\n\nFrom these group sessions emerged a movie with a unique structure: The first and last sequences in “Head” feature a leap off Long Beach’s Gerald Desmond Bridge.\n\n“The movie does not have a beginning or an end — it’s circular,” Dolenz said. He recalled that at a New York party to launch the film that drew such art world luminaries as Andy Warhol, the feature ran simultaneously on five unsynchronized Moviolas, allowing attendees to drop into the “story” wherever they liked.\n\nUltimately, moviegoers decided to drop out on “Head” completely. Poorly reviewed when it was reviewed at all, the feature swiftly disappeared off American screens. Its abject failure and the cancellation of “The Monkees” hastened the departure of Peter Tork from the group in early 1969; the remaining members called it quits in 1970. Many reunions would follow from the ‘90s on; Nesmith and Dolenz noted their plans for more duo concert dates in 2019. (A Monkees Christmas album featuring Dolenz, Nesmith and Tork was also released last month.)\n\nWhile Schneider (who died in 2011) and Rafelson went on to make such commercial and artistic successes as “Five Easy Pieces” and “The King of Marvin Gardens,” the cataclysmic flop of “Head” robbed the producers of an outrageous bit of advertising copy.\n\nDolenz recalled that when he asked Rafelson about the cryptic title of the movie, the director replied, “When we make our next movie, we’re gonna be able to say: From the Producers Who Gave You ‘Head.’”"
