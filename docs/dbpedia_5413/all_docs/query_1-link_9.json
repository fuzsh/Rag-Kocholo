I was playing through a Tech 21 SansAmp Blonde right into my mixer/PA-just the small monitors, with a little bit of stereo chorus into the board. Just magical. I seem to be on a Who kick lately, Bargain, Substitute, the Kids are Alright, just some fun jamming. I also throw in some John Denver and Glenn Campbell too. Now, you all have piqued my interest in some Monkey's material, I need to do some homework.\n\nthunder58\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nDec 23, 2010\n\n32,300\n\nTappan N.Y.\n\nApr 9, 2021\n\n#10\n\n@gretschguy , Seems you're looking for a blonde one ?
