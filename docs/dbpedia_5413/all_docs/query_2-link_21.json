        "text": "Howard Roberts was known as the 5th Monkee - he was a top L.A. session player - first on the list. I believe he did the Leads on \"Last Train to Clarksville\" plus he did most of their sessions.\n\nThe actual guitar players in the group were nothing special in my opinion - it was a group created by record executives using classified advertising to find the members. Something like a low-key American Idol approach - auditions but without the tv show.\n\nGlen Cambell was also an L.A. session player before making it as a singer & worked with the Beachboys.\n\nWasn't it the norm for session players to play on the records? I read that it was kind of a departure when they 'allowed' Roger McGuinn to play on the first Byrds recordings.\n\nWhen George Martin first booked The Beatles for a recording session, they had Pete Best as a drummer. When they turned up, a session drummer named Andy White was set up and ready to play. He actually played on the singlet version of 'Love Me Do' (Ringo played tambourine). When George martin realised that Ringo was a far superior drummer to Pete Best, he allowed him to play on the recordings. Ringo plays on the album version of 'Love Me Do' - you can tell the difference (no tambourine.)\n\nDanny Cedrone, a session player, was hired to play the lead solo on 'Rock Around The Clock'(he died a few short weeks later.)\n\nAh, I'm being a boring old fart - sorry!\n\nThere was a guy i knew a while back who was courted by some major labels... The lucky so and so was given a Rickenbacker by one of them (couldn't tell you which model, this was 15 years ago).\n\nHe told me with most record companies it was normal practice for session players to be used if it's felt that the artists are taking too long to lay down the tracks!\n\nI think it was all studio pros in the studio for the Monkees' first recordings. The band auditioned for the parts so the Monkees existed even before they got together.\n\nThe band had talent - Nesmith was a good writer and Dolenz, IMHO, was a much better singer than Davy Jones. So they eventually seized control of their own recordings, hooking up with Jack Nicholson and going psychedelic.\n\nI recall a documentary where Monkees mastermind Don Kirshner talked about giving them Sugar Sugar for a single release if they'd just stick together. But the band split up and Sugar Sugar became a worldwide smash for another manufactured group - The Archies.\n\nI also think that Roger McGuinn was the only Byrd that got to play on the Byrds' first singles.\n\nWasn't it the norm for session players to play on the records? I read that it was kind of a departure when they 'allowed' Roger McGuinn to play on the first Byrds recordings.\n\nWhen George Martin first booked The Beatles for a recording session, they had Pete Best as a drummer.

Andy White was hired because George Martin didn't know if Ringo could play.\n\nWhether or not Ringo was a far superior drummer is probably a bit unclear as no-one really knows for sure which version was released. Notes in studios were notoriously flakey in those days.\n\nWhen it came down to it, The boys wanted Ringo so as long as he could aquit himself competently then he was the guy for the job. (personally I thought Ringo was a great drummer..not a lot of technique but he had style)\n\nApparently, Steve Stills auditioned, but didn't get it because of 'bad teeth'. So he told a buddy of his--Peter Tork--to audition....\n\nAccording to Stills the teeth weren't the issue -they could've fixed the teeth. It was all about publishing rights. They wanted all of the publishing rights to the songs he would write and he wouldn't go for that. So he called Peter Tork and told him to get down there and audition for the part.\n\nThey used a lot of session players back in the day for many of the bands. Glen Cambell, Carol Kay (on bass), James Burton. Barney Kessel did the guitar work on the first two Ricky Nelson records -he was a friend of Ricky's dad from the big band days. It was a pretty common practice to use session players to either get the parts right or to speed up the process. Even Jimmy Page played on recording sessions that, according to him (and said with a sly grin) \"would shock people if they knew who\".\n\nThe main reason that the Monkees broke up was because Mike and Peter were serious about their music where Mickey and David had no music talent at all except singing. mickey was an actor and David chased the ponies as a jockey. The studio wanted to make the monkees play the music and act as the studio wanted, not as Mike and Peter wanted. Towards the end the studio gave in (after a law suit) let the boys produce their own music and the TV show. It wasn't long afterwords the show shut down. The Monkees tried a comeback in the late 80's or early 90's, Mike did one gig and walked away to never return as a Monkee. Mike is now doing country. There is a video out called the History of the Monkees. It was really well done.\n\nEven Jimmy Page played on recording sessions that, according to him (and said with a sly grin) \"would shock people if they knew who\".\n\nGOLD-fing-er!\n\nThough the liner notes on the album credit Vic Flick with the guitar work, Page has said it is actually him. Outside of some acoustic strumming there isn't much guitar on the famous Shirley Bassey sung version of the theme, but there is a ripping instrumental version of the theme on the soundtrack album and it is most likely that version is the one featuring Page's guitar playing."
