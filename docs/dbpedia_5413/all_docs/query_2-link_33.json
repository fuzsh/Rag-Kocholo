        "text": "For usable bowls - that is, for a bowl that is meant to be actually used (kitchen or whatever) - anyone care to offer up guidelines? I ask because I recently happened to run into someone that does bowl turning (definitely not an AAW member, though) and , I hesitate to criticize someone, but I know of him from LONG ago, and even back then, he had, let's say, a certain reputation, among certain circles that I was in... Anyhow, he took it upon himself to try to tell me that my bowls were Too THIN! (an 8 inch salad bowl in ash that is a bit over 1/4 inch wall thickness - maybe closer to 5/16 inch) and claimed that they \"couldn't hold the weight\" (whatever that was supposed to mean) I quite literally had to bite my tongue to try and remain polite (there were others around as well, none were turners.. but they'd known the guy much longer than they'd known me - I was the new kid on the block... so to speak)\n\nWell , I got home, decided to test out what *I* think (thinking that my wall thickness was perfectly fine - HIS bowls were quite thick - most appeared to be over a half inch thick walls, even for a 7 or 8 inch bowl , though many that I saw were rather straight-sided.) I took my bowl and turned it upside down on the floor and actually just stood on it (as in like a step stool) and figured, if a bowl can hold 180 lbs of human being, it's probably plenty strong enough to hold as many apples or potatoes as could be fit into it...\n\nSo, my question is -- How thin is too thin? are there any sort of real guidelines (wall thickness to diameter ratios? particular use cases? ) Not looking for any validation (I am satisfied with my bowl results so far, for the use I intended them for when I turned them - I'm not letting some guy that may or may not really have a clue tell me what is right or wrong... since, really, there ISN'T really right or wrong when it comes to designs turned on the lathe..., right?) But, I'd definitely like to get some ideas from the REAL turners on this forum and the AAW as to what actually might be a little too thin or too thick, when a bowl is turned for a particular use or purpose..\n\nI don't measure thickness, it's right when it looks and feels good. Some light weight woods I leave thicker as I think they need a little weight to feel correct. Denser wood objects might be a little thinner.\n\nIf I had to guess (I'm too lazy to go measure) most of my bowls probably fall somewhere in between yours and those of your acquaintance. If he likes his bowl thick, good for him. If you like yours thinner, that's good too. Diameter and thickness are easy to measure, and thus critique by those who have no other concept of design. Much more goes into a well designed and executed bowl than those two parameters.\n\nI think we often spend too much time trying to meet the expectations of others. If you like the bowls you make, that's all that matters.\n\nThis was pretty much exactly my thought process when I was turning most of my bowls to date (but then I haven't been turning bowls all that long, and I'm self-taught from reading here and elsewhere, and youtube videos ) and just because of that being self-taught , but aware enough that the guy was nowhere near being as authoritative on turning (or flatwork for that matter) as he probably would have liked people to think, I wanted to get some further opinion on the subject.. which obviously is why I turned to the forum here ... But, between Emiliano and Paul, seems the consensus rather sort of prefers what to me seems about right to my sense of proportion.. I guess I should trust my gut instinct a little more..\n\nOn the other hand, I was more curious if there were among us, some engineer types that might sort of break down the whys and wherefores of wall thickness and any relevance it might have to the form or shape of a bowl.. To my thoughts, a typical tapered/curved bowl upside down, forms a triangle , and thus would have greater strength and stability than a straight sided (forming a square shape) bowl... but then again it is just my sense of the ideas.. I never went beyond H.S. Diploma but tend to be autodidactic.. (so I learn quickly.. I went from being a small engine mechanic to an auto mechanic to computer programmer and systems administrator as my full time jobs, all the while developing other skills and hobbies from woodworking to resin casting, sewing, cooking, gardening, needlepoint, etc) Anyhoo... from the gist I get of some engineering concepts that I picked up along the way somewhere (probably when working for a construction company as the fleet mechanic.. which is where I first ran into someone elses opinion of the guy I mentioned,, LOL!) just seemed to me shape and form for functional might by nature of intended use, necessarily be different , as opposed to shape and form for decorative (which really is limited only by the imagination)\n\nSo I wondered if there might be any basis to utility bowl design guidelines other than \"to each his own\"\n\nAgree with most all the comments - if it feels right to you, looks right relative to the bowl size then it's right. I used to fret over wall thickness then quit. I've made and sold lots of bowls and have never had anyone decide to buy or not to buy based on wall thickness. I've heard it said here and other places - the only people that really give a flip about wall thickness are turners. That said - consistency does make a big difference to me. Early on for me it was common to have a nice edge wall thickness and then get much much thicker as it went toward the bottom and the bowl would just feel clunky and out of proportion. I've gone back and returned a few that I could manage to mount. It's subjective to me. If a natural edge and the bark is bold and sturdy I'll leave it a bit thicker to highlight the bark. If it comes off or is just not interesting I'll turn it thinner and move on. I do work to keep it consistent since everyone wants to pick them up and feel them before they buy and consistency makes them feel better. At least to me. In general, I find 5/16 - 3/8 a good target but I seldom if ever actually measure them. Do a few and you'll know when it feels right. Consistency also greatly minimizes cracking during the drying process for natural edge bowls, hollow forms, etc.\n\nSo far, seems to me it is a case of \"Just do your thing\" - I guess only thing that really bothered me (being relatively new to turning and totally new to the \"market booth\" experience) was just the doubt that comes when someone with several years experience (albeit not necessarily GOOD experience) tries to tell you what you're doing wrong... I'd be willing to bet he'd have found something \"not done right\" with something turned by someone like Ellsworth (assuming, that is, he wasn't aware whose work it was.) So, my plan for any future markets, I'll also take along some props (buy a couple bags of fruit, some flower arrangements at the grocery store before the event, take along some costume jewelry and other props, etc) to stage my work .. and if someone again tries to say \"that's too thin\" I can always dump a heap of fruit in a bowl and ask them \"how much weight does it NEED to hold?\" Thanks for the replies.. I feel somewhat better, and a bit vindicated..\n\nI also learned that some things that \"everybody else\" (meaning Youtube, etc) says \"They sell like hotcakes at markets\" .. does not necessarily apply around here. Example- Weed pots / bud vases - I got a lot of comments from people as to why my vases were \"unfinished\" - though they were done in the supposedly popular style leaving the bark , knots, bit of branches, etc on them... that stuff don't wash around here, I guess.. so I'll keep a couple or three of my better ones, and toss the rest on the firewood pile.. I did only turn them for the specific purpose of selling at the markets, so it may have had an effect on my design choices.. but even my best ones got odd looks from just about everybody that came by... So I guess I can say, I am learning my local market\n\nHere's a tip for you Brian. It seems you don't want a critique of your work, so say so when you walk in with it. Some people don't take criticism well, others are fine with it. I'm in the group who find it incredibly valuable for other turners to give me opinions on my turnings.\n\nNo actually I have no problem with criticism... My post was because I wanted opinion from more sources than just one person whose word-of-mouth reputation gave me reason to have doubts as to the veracity of his claims... I wanted to know the opinions of more than just one person because I have nothing else to compare to, and by all I have seen (in most photos on here at the AAW) it seems rare to see a bowl as thick as those I saw held up to me as examples...\n\nHOWEVER, I also was not sure enough whether those photos were just \"art\" or if they were actually designed as usable. I suppose I would say - Items that might fall into the category of \"Production\" marketable items - not necessarily the most beautiful, best looking ones (which I tend to suspect are the ones that get posted in galleries.) - I did not want to waste my efforts trying to turn more bowls intended for market, that more than just a few might deem as being \"too thin to use\", or too fragile, etc. (Hence my question whether there was any science/formula behind form/design/thickness, such as ratio numbers, etc.)\n\nIn short, I don't want to be wasting my lathe time making stuff that I don't necessarily want for myself or someone else, and that DOESNT sell (despite several dozen \"big city\" turner videos out there that say they sell like hotcakes) - If I was turning just for me, I wouldn't bother with some of the stuff I do.. but I want to try and create some stuff to sell at market (to generate revenue to support my shop).\n\nLike John, if I don't enjoy turning it, like it when I'm done and learn something in the process then I won't. Every bowl I make is not my favorite but I would put any of them on a table in my house. At least until my wife saw it. Figuring out what folks will buy is a very tough challenge to use to drive what you turn. I've done a lot of local markets (rural TN) and it took a while to see what people were interested in. Even then I would do a market and sell a lot, do another market across town and sell almost nothing, etc. So many variables - weather, calendar, other events, other vendors, location in the market, price expectations, etc. I've done enough now to only be able to know what the likely best selling items are in my area but, other folks here have very different markets and demographics. A 9-12\" natural edge bowl with character (knots, bark, bug holes, etc) sells well for me most of the time. Some events I can sell a number of hollow forms, next event no one even picks one up. I guess my input from this is make what you like, your friends and family like and then find some local markets and try a variety. Selling online is a whole different world of course.\n\nHmm.. definitely some food for thought here. I sort of already \"knew\" that probably selling at a market like this would probably be hit and miss... but have found that I can't always depend on research on what sells; what sells well in one area, might not sell at all in other areas... I do have a couple people I can depend on for honest opinion (insofar as how something LOOKS and FEELS or being useful..) at least now so I think I may just try making a sample of whatever comes to mind or that I want to try and then see what THEY think. (Indeed, couple days ago, got told one of my flatwork projects was a) too big, and b) ugly as &^$^.. despite me admiring my hand-cut dovetail work, and beauty of the grain selection in the wood.... So, I know to not make any more of those. LOL!) But none of them are really engineer types that could constructively critique on design/suitability for purpose (neither is the one offering that so-called \"helpful\" criticism that triggered this post)\n\nAs for selling online, honestly, no thanks.. I used to move a quarter million a year in ebay dollar volume, shipping over 1500-2000 packages a month, and just the thought of turning back to organizing and setting up the efficient logistics again to stock & ship product myself makes me think again about trying to sell on etsy or elsewhere that might require me to offer shipping. I just don't want to deal with all that again. (plus the constant fees and percentages that those places swipe off the top.) I may consider it as a last resort, if I can't seem to get any momentum going on local sales. (people around here are just CHEAP when they're buying, nothing is ever worth what you're asking, and you gotta deliver to them in the next town over.. but when they are selling, whatever it is, seemingly is made of gold... probably some of you know how that goes, in very tiny rural areas. )\n\nFor usable bowls - that is, for a bowl that is meant to be actually used (kitchen or whatever) - anyone care to offer up guidelines? I ask because I recently happened to run into someone that does bowl turning (definitely not an AAW member, though) and , I hesitate to criticize someone, but I know of him from LONG ago, and even back then, he had, let's say, a certain reputation, among certain circles that I was in...

But, I'd definitely like to get some ideas from the REAL turners on this forum and the AAW as to what actually might be a little too thin or too thick, when a bowl is turned for a particular use or purpose..\n\nIt's always good to 'meet' another woodturner whose first name is Brian! I tend to turn my wall thicknesses to a 1/4 inch or more, which some turners think is too thick. I would rather concentrate on the shape and design of the turning than on the achievement of a very thin wall. That said, some of my segmented twisted objects are a challenge to turn internally because the shapes generated by the multi-axis approach are triangular and not circular. I was turning the inside of one of my segmented twisted shapes when the tool started to chirp at increasing frequencies. I wondered if the tool was just chattering until I saw a hole opening up in the wall. I guess I found out what the limit on thickness is. Not to be defeated by a hole in the shape, I created three matching holes in the twisted vase and called it a redesign. The message here is to listen to what the wood is telling you as you engage the wood. If you don't listen, you often get an unwanted surprise.\n\nHere's an image of that 'redesigned' segmented twisted vase.\n\nAttachments\n\nhole in wall vase.jpg\n\nMy view on thickness has evolved over time. Most of my turnings lately are 6-7” pieced candy bowls, or 9-14” twice turned. I’m self taught, and from the reading I did when I first started turning ~25 yrs ago I thought that it had to be thin to be good.\n\nI’ve made a number of 1/16-1/8” that frankly look nice, but I don’t find as functional; nor do people gravitate towards these when examining my work. I also have a number of bowls where I started the rims around 3/16” and got down around 1/16” at the bottom of the curve near the base, or sometimes in the middle of the foot - I’ve decidedly not liked getting this thin and inconsistent even though the curves are graceful.\n\nI’ve turn some thick for artistic purposes, or with a thick rim to show off some wood characteristic. Some of these in larger bowls are 5-8-3/4” (couple with expanded rims up to 1.5”) and I like them.\n\nOver the last year the pandemic gave me more shop time and I turned a couple hundred bowls and plates. Add that to the 50 or so laying around the house gives me a lot of data points to compare. I also did some experiments with thickness and glues subjecting them to multiple dishwasher cycles as a stress/accelerator.\n\nMy current thinking is that sometimes I intentionally choose to go very thin, or thicker for artistic purposes. But as a general rule I like:\n\n~1/4” - 5/16” consistent wall thicknesses for 6-7” bowls.\n\n~3/16-1/4” consistent walls for 5-6” bowls\n\n~3/16” generally for small plates (up to 8-9”)\n\n~1/4” generally for larger plates (~12”), thinner towards rim\n\nLarger bowls 9-14” I tend to like 5/16-3/8”, but have a couple natural edge ones at 1/4” that my wife loves (even though they look too thin to me) and a couple that are intentionally ~5/8” that just work well with that design.\n\nMy stress experiments showed me that 1/8” and less did not hold up well, but 3/16”+ Titebond 2&3 joints survived many dishwasher cycles so I try not to go below 3/16” anymore.\n\nSmooth fair curves and consistent wall thicknesses are the things I think about most, thicknesses are influenced by the rim geometry I choose; and each bowl design evolves at the time as I turn it (and as Odie would say “become one with the wood” )."
