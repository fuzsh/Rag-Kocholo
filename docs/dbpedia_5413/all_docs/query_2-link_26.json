        "text": "So I get in my truck, start it, and hear a song I'm positive I have not heard in like 40 years.\n\nIt was on the oldies station, (yea, go figure)......\n\nWho played that lead? I doubt it was Michael Nesmith......\n\nAnd, what was the gear. I never thought about it 40 years ago.\n\nMurph.\n\nGoogle says:\n\nThere were two versions of Valleri recorded and \"released\" during the Monkees' popularity. The first version, used in Season 1 of the TV show, was never released on a single or LP until the early 1990s. If you have any of the early episodes, you will see the video (it was used twice) where Davy is put onto a cherry picker and raised above the floor as he sings. In this version, the guitar bridge was played by Louis Shelton.\n\nThe following year Valleri was included on the Monkees' fifth LP, the Birds the Bees and the Monkees, and was released as a single. On this version you will also hear a horn section during the instrumental parts. The guitarist on this version was again famed sessions guitarist Louis Shelton.\n\nThroughout the years, Glen Campbell has been credited with performing on the first version of the song. However, records kept at the Colgems studios state that Shelton was indeed the guitarist.\n\nOh well..........\n\nTim,\n\nYou reminded me about something............\n\nA while back there was a \"Tequila\" thread and I believe one of the factoids put Seals and/or Crofts with Glen Campbell at some point in the Champs' existence.\n\nDoes that mean if we can find 3-4 more \"degrees\" we may end up with Kevin Bacon on lead (no Tele, though--I think he's a Gibson guy)?\n\nEd\n\n\"valleri\" is a great track, and one that doesn't get as much notice as other Monkees hits. i don't get too hung up on the Monkees not writing a lot of their own material, or using studio musicians. they were lots of fun and made some terrific records.\n\nwonder how many of our favorite recordings feature work by secret studio musicians?\n\non a side note, i seem to remember that Mike Nesmith DID play guitar on \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\", one of my favorite Monkees hits.\n\nThis thread is THE BEST EVER!\n\nThe VERY FIRST record I ever owned was Valerie by The Monkees. I remember it well...mom took me grocerie shopping (she couldn't leave me at home alone on the farm because I was afraid the cows would get me)...I picked out my favorite cereal from the cereal isle...and inside the cereal box was a Monkees vinyl record. I took it home, opened the box, poured out all the cereal, and found the record. It was VALERIE by the MONKEES! I bet I spun that record until the diamond wore thru it.\n\nOn a side note, listening to the song today, it sounds like the guitar solo has a tad bit of guitar doubling. Maybe a delay or recording trick. It's kind of a let-down finding out that Nesmith didn't actually play it. Next your gonna tell me that they DIDN'T really just spend the day monkeying around.\n\nThe VERY FIRST record I ever owned was Valerie by The Monkees.

I bet I spun that record until the diamond wore thru it.\n\nI had a Monkees cereal box record, too. It was \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\". IIRC, though, it wasn't inside the box, it actually was part of the box and I had to cut it out of the box with a scissors. Also, I think that the cereal was Honey Combs.\n\nI loved that song. When I try out fuzz boxes it's the first thing I play. If it can nail the tone, it's a keeper.\n\nI dated a girl named Valerie. She hated that song, and the one by Steve Winwood, and the one by Richard Thompson and the one by...\n\nand inside the cereal box was a Monkees vinyl record\n\nThat is how I obtained The Archies - Sugar Sugar. Cut me some slack. I was 6 years old. I cut it off the back of a Honey Combs box and played it in the square shape that I cut.\n\nThanks for the Valeri info. I always wondered that my self.\n\nJim"
