        "text": "Click here to download a pdf version of this pattern.\n\nSizes: adult medium\n\nFinished Measurements: 15″/38 cm circumference and 10 1/2″/27 cm tall (unstretched, see note below)\n\nYarn: 3 skeins Debbie Bliss Cashmerino Aran (55% merino wool/33% microfiber/12% cashmere; 82 yards/90 meters; 1.75 oz/50 g), color #300506\n\nMaterials:\n\n1 set size 10 1/2 double-pointed needles\n\n1 stitch marker\n\n1 large tapestry needle\n\n1 2 1/2″ Clover pom-pom maker (optional)\n\nGauge: 17 stitches and 19 rows = 4″/10 cm in 1 X 1 rib stitch with two strands held together\n\nA note about gauge and finished measurements: this hat is worked with two strands held together throughout and is meant to be worn stretched out to fit snugly on the top of the head. Unstretched, the finished circumference will be considerably smaller than average adult head measurements.\n\nInstructions:\n\nCast on 64 stitches with two strands held together. Place stitch marker at beginning of round. Work in 1 X 1 rib stitch (*knit one, purl one*, repeat from * to * until end of row) until hat measures 8″/20.5 cm from cast-on row.\n\nBegin shaping top of hat as follows:\n\nTop Round 1: (work 6 stitches in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–56 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 2: (work 5 stitches in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–48 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 3: (work 4 stitches in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–40 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 4: (work 3 stitches in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–32 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 5: (work 2 stitches in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–24 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 6: (work 1 stitch in rib patt, knit 2 together) 8 times–16 stitches remain\n\nTop Round 7: knit 2 together 8 times–8 stitches remain\n\nDo not bind off. Cut yarn leaving a tail approximately 12″/30.5 cm from knitting needle and thread the end through the tapestry needle. Insert the tapestry needle into the last stitch in the row purlwise and thread it through all the stitches on the dpns. Remove each dpn slowly as you thread through all the stitches on that needle. Pull the yarn taut forming a circle. Tie the yarn off.\n\nPom-pom: you can use a Clover 2 1/2″ pom-pom maker or do it yourself by wrapping the yarn around a stiff piece of cardboard (or something similar) about 2 – 2 1/2”/5 – 6.5 cm wide. Wrap the yarn around the cardboard until the pom-pom is the desired thickness. Cut yarn about 20”/51 cm from the cardboard. Thread the end of the yarn through the tapestry needle and wrap it three times around the center of the pom-pom loops, pulling them taut. Pull the pom-pom off the piece of cardboard. Make a strong, tight knot in the yarn wrapped around the center of the pom-pom. Cut the ends of the pom-pom loops and trim to form a round ball of the desired size. Attach the pom-pom to the top center of the hat with the tapestry needle and yarn.\n\nEnjoy your groovy new hat! Wear it and you’ll get the funniest looks from everyone you meet!\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this pattern, or you just want to send me some pictures of your finished Michael Nesmith Hat, email me at thelyfsoshort{at}att.net or fill out the comment box below."
