        "text": "Ugh\n\nDown to micky\n\nI think I’m feeling old\n\nI keep a death watch on my friends from back home.\n\nWhen I talk to my sister back there,it's who's died?\n\nLots of my closest friends from high school and college are gone and I'm talking 50's and 60's here.\n\nMy ex just died at 58 last year.\n\nYou know somethings up when you walk into a local bar and there's a plaque on a chair commemorating somebody you had gym class with.\n\nSaw that in Colaiuta's home town of Republic at one of the bars.\n\nTerrible loss, When I was small, the Monkees reruns on Saturday mornings were my first introduction to any kind of rock band, Micky was probably the first drummer I became aware of. I had all their records by the time I was school-aged and practiced to them while I was learning to play (still do)\n\nIrrespective of the \"fake band\" stuff, Mike Nesmith was a great writer, penning some of their best tunes as well as some great stuff on his own (and of course \"Different Drum\"). Also quite an innovator in the video industry.\n\nI remember seeing them on their '86 tour, and a few times since then. Very sad to see some influences from our formative years passing away.\n\nThanks for the music Mike.\n\nI got to see him and Mickey just last month in Milwaukee and then again in St Louis. He was having a blast performing and basking in love from the audiences. This one is tough around my household. My girlfriend has some ties to the family and Ive been a big Monkees fans since childhood. Love Nez’s solo stuff and his video album Elephant Parts is one of my favorite things.\n\nVariety has posted a great interview with Mike's manager detailing his recent, final shows and how high a wave Mike went out on, performing for strong numbers and much love.\n\nI'm relieved to read how much Mike had finally come to terms with the Monkees's legacy after decades of dismissing it. At last, he even seemed to embrace what the Monkees meant for the fans.\n\nA major David Letterman fan on youtube posted Dave's interview with Mike from 1983, and it's mostly about Elephant Parts. It even features clips.\n\nHard to pick a favorite Beatle, but Mike was definitely my favorite Monkee. Rest in Peace, sir.\n\nMonkees’ Manager on Michael Nesmith’s Final Months: ‘He Died Knowing They Were Beloved — He Finally Got It’\n\nIt might've been Michael Nesmith's desire to do one last tour and tell his fans that he \"got it\" that kept him alive, says their manager."
