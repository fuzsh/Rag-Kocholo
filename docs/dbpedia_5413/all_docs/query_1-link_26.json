        "text": "Dear Furum,\n\nI read that one of Mike Nesmith of the Monkees Gretsch guitars was converted from a 6 string to a 12 string. And that a second one was made custom for him in the Gretsch factory.\n\nI think the natural finish one was the factory 12 string right?\n\nI think I would like to make a reproduction of this guitar. Buy an absolute basket case 6 string, and make a new 12 string neck for it.\n\nWhich 6 string guitar would be the best starting point? A country Gentleman or a Country Club model?\n\nThanks\n\nChris\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfuBREMXxts\"]YouTube - The Monkees - I'm a Believer [official music video][/ame]\n\nSomething like this?\n\nThis was my project last year. It was a long, painstaking build but worth the struggle. I'll bet Mr Gretsch never used Home Depot maple\n\nmy favorite guitar\n\nNice nice nice! Do you have more pics of the build as you did it!?\n\nAre CC and CG models different?\n\nDoes the Country Club model have the same body dimensions and construction as the Nesmith 12 string? I would like to construct a reproduction similar to the one blackvet made, by replacing the headstock and modifying the fingerboard inlays.\n\nPerhaps starting with a guitar like this one?\n\nI would need to drill and add that additional switch to the right of the bridge.\n\nI just am wondering if the bodies on the 60's gretsch guitars are all shaped the same or if they are different from model to model. Since I will be looking for a basket case natural finish guitar, from the 60's, I am wondering if I should only use a Country Gentleman for a base for my project, or if Country club models are the same (except for that extra switch)\n\nThanks\n\nAny double cut 17\" body model will work for a conversion. Mikes had a flip up Mute so a Country Gent with one will be one less thing to reproduce.\n\nMike's converted 12 string was a Tennesean, NOT the natural double cut 12 you see in most of the TV shows. The converted guitar was only in the Pilot.\n\nThe guitar pictured has the volume/tone knobs in a slightly different position than the Nemith 12 string. It's still sort of unclear how Mike Nesmiths 12 string came to be...I think it's safe to say the body is a Tennessan...not a Gent. It has a single mute also. For your project your best bet would be to find a \"blond\" Tennessian \"project\" guitar...one that has neck problems. The neck would have to be removed and replaced with a scratch-built one with a 12 string headstock. The tailpiece would also have to sourced... Sounds simple enough??? NOT! It turned out easier for me to start from scratch..."
