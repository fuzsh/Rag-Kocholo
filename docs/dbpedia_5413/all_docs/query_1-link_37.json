        "text": "The Monkees member Mike Nesmith had significant success\n\nIn 1967, when the made-for-TV band the Monkees was selling more records than the Beatles and using Jimi Hendrix as an opening concert act, Mike Nesmith was the most musical Monkee.\n\nHe was the lead guitarist, one of their first music producers and a composer of such Monkees hits as \"Mary, Mary\" and \"Listen to the Band.\" When the show's producers released an album by their fictional band, it was Nesmith who protested they were trying to deceive the public into believing the Monkees were a real band. After that, actor Micky Dolenz learned to play drums and the band played their own instruments in concert and on their next LP, \"Headquarters.\"\n\nAfter \"The Monkees,\" Nesmith was the only band member to have significant musical success. He assembled the First National country band before the Monkees' breakup and had hits with \"Joanne\" and \"Silver Moon.\"\n\nCombined with his composition of Linda Ronstadt's 1967 breakthrough single, \"Different Drum,\" he can credibly be called a pioneer of country rock.\n\nBut Nesmith, a native of Houston, never restricted himself to just one genre of music or art. He also pioneered music videos, having won the first Grammy Award for long-form video in 1982 for his hour-long NBC TV show, \"Elephant Parts.\" He produced the music videos for Michael Jackson's \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and Lionel Richie's \"All Night Long.\"\n\nHis Nickelodeon TV show, \"PopClips,\" was sold to Time-Warner/Amex and developed into MTV.\n\nHe's continued to produce films, including \"Repo Man\" and \"Tapeheads,\" and make music. He toured with surviving Monkees Peter Tork and Dolenz in 2012 and 2013, and did a \"Movies of the Mind\" tour showcasing his wide range of music.\n\nHe's now performing in support of a live album from that tour. His stop Sunday at Stagecoach: California's Country Music Festival won't include his early non-country music, but Nesmith talked about that and more in a recent interview.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: I know you have Texas folk roots, but your first solo album, \"Wichita Train Whistle Songs,\" was a rock-big band fusion. What kind of musical statement were you making using session players (including Palm Desert-based drummer Hal Blaine) to record that kind of music?\n\nNESMITH: I was swinging at the brass ring that \"Chicago\" finally hit. Clearly I missed.\n\nThe Monkees famously rebelled against using session musicians, even though all of the top L.A. bands of that time used them. Why was it so important for you guys to play your own instruments?\n\nIt seemed an issue to the rock press at the time, but we only tried one album: \"Headquarters.\" It was a huge hit for us but the realities of us doing a weekly television show and creating a flow of music for that at the same time was just out of reach. So the final result was a mixture of self-played songs and self-produced songs and some of the product from the Brill Building.\n\nYou have some very good session players on \"Movies of the Mind.\" At this point, do you see an advantage to using studio guys instead of trying to keep a band together?\n\nYes. Session players are some of the finest musicians in the world. Session players can keep the work fresh. However, there is something to be said for building a show around a group of players and the band arrangements. I am doing that now with the Movies of the Mind show. I think any decision between \"band\" or \"session cats\" is really a false choice after all. They are not mutually exclusive.\n\nYour work after the Monkees ranked with some of Southern California's great country rock. I really liked your psychedelic treatment of \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds.\" But there was so much country rock in 1969, it was as if everyone had gotten burned out on LSD and started creating simpler music. Why did you return to country and why do you think it became such a trend with Gram Parsons, Linda Ronstadt and the like?\n\nI don't think country rock was really anything other than Southern California music. It was in the water and of the times that came together here in the late '60s. My roots are Texas blues and early rock — and I made no conscious choice to create or work in those forms or the form that is now called country rock. I wrote the songs I recorded for the most part and that would usually drive the arrangements and instrumentation. Those decisions were made with no regard to genre or titles.\n\nSpeaking of LSD, what do you remember about shooting the film, \"Head\" (written by Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafaelson and starring the Monkees) in the Palm Springs area? Is it true you guys walked out for a day because you weren't allowed to direct yourselves or receive screenwriting credits?\n\n\"Head\" was shot in and around a lot of usual film locations in Southern California. Palm Springs had a large area of dunes that was used for the desert segments.\n\nWe refused to report to work the first day of filming because of a contractual dispute that was quickly resolved. We never expected — and I personally didn't want — to direct or get screenwriting credits. Jack Nicholson wrote \"Head\" fair and square. We all contributed in our own way, but he was and is the legitimate author.\n\nNext to the Monkees, you may be best known for pioneering music videos. What do you think of music videos as an art form today? I see incredibly creative short films at our Palm Springs International ShortFest, but music videos seem past their prime as an art form.\n\nI think the music video has matured and come into its own in what you may be classifying as \"creative short films.\" The salient part of the music video had to do with the film grammar it introduced. That grammar is now part of the lingua franca of film in general — very widely used and alive.\n\nHow do you respond to all the changes in the music business with the collapse of record sales, the advance of streaming and the proliferation of music festivals?\n\nI think the collapse of the traditional record business was a self-inflicted wound by the execs of the time and it would appear that the new music business is much better off for it. We seem to be in a transition stage now and the writing is not fully written on the walls of what the business may become. But my sense is that we are in for much better times for the artist and the patron.\n\nMIKE NESMITH BIO:\n\nBorn: Dec. 30, 1942\n\nBest known for: Wearing a wool hat as a member of The Monkees\n\nBiggest solo hit: \"Joanne\"\n\nWhere to see him next: Sunday at the Stagecoach country music festival at the Empire Polo Club, 81-800 Avenue 51, Indio. Tickets are sold out. He plays Tuesday at the Roxy in West Hollywood and Wednesday at the Belly Up in Solana Beach."
