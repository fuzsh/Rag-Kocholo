Edmond Undergraduate Student Paper Competition\n\nRepellency Effects of Incorporated Worm Castings and Compost Tea Sprays on Whitefly Populations for Poinsettia Production (Euphorbia pulcherrima)\n\nErin L. Cathcart*, Patrick N. Williams, and Kris-Ann E. Kaiser, Department of Agricultural Sciences, 213 S. Oakley Applied Science, Murray State University, Murray, KY 42071-3345\n\nEvery year the Murray State University horticulture program produces poinsettias for holiday sales. Fungicidal drenches and systemic insecticides are used to control soilborne pathogens and whitefly populations. This one crop uses more chemicals than any other crop during the year and without some type of control, a salable plant would not be possible. There were four experimental treatments each with four repetitions using a randomized block design: treatment 1, control containing no worm castings or compost tea sprays; treatment 2, 10% worm castings incorporated in the commercial growing substrate only; treatment 3, 10% worm castings incorporated and sprayed with the worm compost tea; and treatment 4, worm compost tea sprays only. Compost tea was applied every 2 weeks. Pinching, watering, shading, and fertilization followed a normally recommended schedule for production. No significant differences were found among treatments, but were found between repetitions and benches. Whitefly counts ranged from 130 to 1374 per plant, and none were considered marketable.\n\nShortening Germination Periods for California Poppy (Eschscholzia californica) Using Incubated Worm Casting Substrates\n\nWilliam T. Criner*, Justin D. Sparks, Patrick N. Williams, and Kris-Ann E. Kaiser, Department of Agricultural Sciences, 213 S. Oakley Applied Science, Murray State University, Murray, KY 42071-3345\n\nOne-year-old worm castings were added to Pro Mix BX® substrate at 20% by volume and incubated at a substrate temperature of 22.2 °C (72 °F) to observe germination rates of California poppy (Eschscholzia californica). Three different treatments were studied to determine the shortest germination periods: treatment 1, control received no incubation period; treatment 2, incubated for 7 days; and treatment 3, incubated for 14 days. Dechlorinated water was used throughout the study to reduce effects of chlorine on microorganism populations. Normal germination rates and range for California poppy are between 60% to 70% at 21 days. Treatments 2 and 3 were significantly different for germination percentage on days 10, 12 and 14 at P ≤ 0.001 over treatment 1. Treatments 2 and 3 had germination percentages higher than normal from 76% to 82% on days 10, 12, and 14. Treatment 1 germination rate was within normal range on day 10, but exceeded normal range for days 12 and 14. Incubated worm casting substrate mixtures increased germination percentages and reduced days to germination.\n\nLandscaping for Water Quality: Designing a Demonstration Garden for the Friends of Lake Keowee Society Headquarters\n\nDavid Warren* and Mary Haque, Department of Horticulture, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634\n\nClemson University Landscape Design students along with the Friends of Lake Keowee Society (FOLKS) joined together in an effort to create a demonstration garden to help educate the community about protecting Lake Keowee and its surrounding watersheds. In order to accomplish the goals of the project, the team followed a five-step landscape design methodology that included research, site analysis, conceptual design, preliminary design, and final design. The design showcases different low impact development (LID) techniques that improve water quality. A few examples of low impact development (LID) techniques used in the design include constructed wetland, rain garden, rain barrel, porous pavements, and shoreline buffer. These demonstration features will help educate the community about the importance of landscaping for water quality.\n\nNitrogen Mineralization in Greenhouse Turnips (Brassica campestris L.) Amended with Compost and Organic Fertilizer\n\nRachel Ben-Avraham*, Danielle Treadwell, and Mike Alligood, Department of Horticultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0690\n\nOrganic fertilizers, unlike inorganic fertilizers, depend on biological and chemical processes to release plant available nitrogen. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of organic matter on mineralization of nitrogen from organic fertilizers. Turnips were grown in pots in a polyethylene fan and pad greenhouse under four levels of organic matter (OM) that were made using commercially available mushroom compost and builder's sand to simulate typical OM content in Florida soils (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%). Two different fertilizers approved for use in organic production, Perdue 4-2-3, and Nature Safe 8-5-5, and two sources of inorganic fertilizer, CaNO3 (15.5-0-0) and NH4SO4 (21-0-0), were added at the same concentration of N-P2O-K2O. Treatments were analyzed over 7 weeks for plant available nitrogen in pot media solution and plant nitrogen content. Both OM and fertilizer source affected plant available nitrogen, but there was no interaction between the two factors. Mineral nitrogen increased as OM increased in every week. Plant available nitrogen (mg N/kg media) in week 7 increased as organic matter increased when averaged over fertilizer sources (16.2%, 44.2%, 62.7%, and 82.4% for 0%, 1%, 2%, and 4% OM, respectively). Plant available nitrogen was greatest with inorganic fertilizers compared to organic fertilizers, whereas organic fertilizers followed similar trends to the control, with no fertilizer. Organic 4-2-3 and NH4SO4 had higher plant nitrogen contents than the other treatments. Within fertilizer source, plant nitrogen generally increased with increasing OM except in the case of organic 4-2-3 + 2% OM. In the 7 weeks of this study, mineral nitrogen in pot media solution with the inorganic fertilizer treatments was greater than the organic fertilizer treatments. The greatest differences in mineral nitrogen and plant nitrogen content were observed with increasing soil OM, illustrating the benefits of having soils high in organic matter.\n\nNorman F. Childers MS Graduate Student Paper Competition\n\nUtilization of Commercially Available Pollenizers for Optimizing Triploid Watermelon Production\n\nPeter J. Dittmar*1, David W. Monks1, and Jonathan R. Schultheis1, 1North Carolina State University, Department of Horticultural Science, Raleigh, NC 27695-7609\n\nDifferent planting arrangements of diploid (pollenizer) watermelon cultivars were tested for optimizing yield and fruit quality of triploid (seedless) watermelon fruit. The treatments with one pollenizer cultivar included ‘Companion’, ‘Super Pollenizer 1’ (‘SP1’), and ‘Summer Flavor 800’ (‘SF800’). The treatments with a combination of two pollenizers included ‘Companion’ + ‘SP1’, ‘Companion’ + ‘SF800’, and ‘SP1’ + ‘SF800’. Plant arrangement was compared by planting ‘SF800’ in a hill and inter-planted method. Transplant timing of pollenizers was compared by planting ‘SP1’ at the same time as the triploid plants and 3 weeks after triploid transplanting. The final treatment contained no pollenizer to determine if there was pollen movement between plots. There was some pollen movement between plots; however, it was minimal as fruit set in the no pollenizer plots was less than 12% of the highest yielding treated plot. For the individual pollenizers in 2005, plots with ‘Companion’ had the largest individual triploid fruit weight compared to ‘Mickylee’, ‘SP1’, or ‘SF800’. ‘Companion’, ‘Mickylee’, or ‘SP1’ resulted in greater marketable triploid fruit yield than ‘SF800’ in 2005. In 2006, using only ‘Companion’ had greater yields than ‘SF800’. ‘SF800’ had fewer triploid fruit with hollow heart than ‘Companion’. Combining ‘SP1’ or ‘SF800’ with ‘Companion’ decreased individual fruit weight in 2005 compared to ‘Companion’ planted alone. However, combining ‘Companion’ + ‘SF800’ increased individual triploid fruit weight compared to ‘SF800’ planted alone. ‘SF800’ + ‘Companion’ in 2005 and ‘SP1’ + ‘Companion’ in 2006 increased marketable yield compared ‘SF800’ or ‘SP1’ pollenizers planted alone. Planting pollenizers in the hill decreased triploid yields compared to inter-planting the pollenizer. Transplanting ‘SP1’ 3 weeks after the triploid plants decreased marketable yields and increased the severity of hollow heart in the triploid fruit. Growers should consider pollenizer selection, planting arrangement, and time of transplanting to optimize triploid production.\n\nStaking, Guying, and Root Ball Anchoring: The Efficacy of Tree Stabilization Systems Installed on Recently Transplanted Trees\n\nAlexis A. Alvey* and P. Eric Wiseman, Department of Forestry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0324\n\nRecently transplanted landscape trees are prone to destabilization from wind gusts. Various forms of staking and guying are used to prevent tree destabilization, but little scientific evidence exists for their efficacy. In this experiment, the efficacy of three generic tree stabilization systems (TSS) was tested. In Spring 2006, 24 balled and burlapped white ash (Fraxinus americana ‘Autumn Purple’) were transplanted to a field site in Blacksburg, Va. At planting, one of four TSS treatments (staking, guying, root ball anchoring, or control) was installed on each tree. Five weeks after planting, destabilization tests were conducted on the trees using a cable winch mounted to a skid-steer loader. First, a force simulating a 55 mph wind gust was applied to each tree. Destabilization was significantly greater for control trees (mean of 16° from vertical) than for trees with TSS (all means less than 3° from vertical). However, there was no significant difference in destabilization among TSS types. Each tree with a TSS was then stressed to complete system failure. The guying system endured significantly greater force before failure than the staking and root ball anchoring systems. The staking system endured significantly less force than the other two systems. The material costs and installation time for each TSS were also evaluated. The staking system was twice as expensive ($7.03) as the guying ($3.31) and root ball anchoring ($3.00) systems. All three systems took between 5 and 6 minutes to install. The guying system required significantly greater time to install than the root ball anchoring system, which did not significantly differ from the staking system. Based on our results, TSS protect recently transplanted landscape trees from destabilization by heavy wind gusts. From a practical standpoint, there were negligible differences among the TSS in terms of failure force and installation time. However, the staking system was twice as expensive as the other two systems, which may warrant consideration when choosing a TSS.\n\nResponse of Texas and Florida Live Oak (Quercus virginiana) Seedlings to Water Deficit Treatments\n\nAmber Bonds* and Thayne Montague, Department of Plant and Soil Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409-2122\n\nLive oak (Quercus virginiana) is a common landscape tree in much of the United States. Although in native areas live oak can be found in mesic and xeric climates, little research has been conducted to determine if provenance differences exist in the response of live oak to deficit irrigation. Therefore, this research investigated gas exchange in response to water deficit irrigation treatments of live oak seedlings from a mesic region Groveland, Fla. (USDA Hardiness zone 9), and a xeric region, Justiceburg, TX (central Texas) (USDA Hardiness Zone 7). In May 2006, 1-year-old live oak seedlings were shipped to Texas Tech from Groveland, Fla. Acorns from Justiceburg were collected from several trees in Oct. 2005. Acorns were germinated and planted according to standard nursery practices. In June 2006, all seedlings were placed outside under shadecloth for 2 weeks and then in full sun for a month to acclimatize. Twenty-one seedlings from each location were brought into a greenhouse, assigned one of three watering treatments (control seedlings were watered every day; moderate water deficit seedlings were watered every other day; and severe water deficit seedlings were watered every fourth day), and arranged in randomized complete blocks. Mid-day stomatal conductance and leaf temperature were measured every fourth day prior to irrigation of severe drought seedlings. Outdoors, prior to irrigation treatments seedlings from Texas had greater stomatal conductance and lower leaf to air vapor pressure deficit (LVPD) when compared to seedlings from Florida. In the greenhouse, seedling gas exchange was influenced by water deficit treatment and provenance. Stomatal conductance and LVPD for Texas seedlings did not differ among water deficit treatments. However, Florida seedlings exposed to severe drought had lower stomatal conductance and a greater LVPD than seedlings exposed to control or moderate irrigation treatments. Regardless of irrigation treatment, seedlings from Texas had greater stomatal conductance and lower LVPD when compared to Florida seedlings. Our data indicate that the response of live oak seedlings from central Texas and Groveland, Fla, differs in their response to water deficit treatments and that live oak trees from central Texas may be better adapted to xeric sites than live oaks from a more mesic environment.\n\nInfluence of Four Salinity Treatments on Growth and Leaf Nutrient Content of Three Taxodium Genotypes\n\nLijing Zhou* and Dave Creech, SFA Mast Arboretum, P.O. Box 13000, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX 75962\n\nAbbreviated as BC, MC, and hybrid in this abstract, baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L Rich var. distichum), montezuma cypress (Taxodium distichum var. mexicana Gordon), and Taxodium × ‘Nanjing Beauty’ (a hybrid, BC × MC) were subjected to acute applications of four salt rates in a container study. Beginning 22 May 2006, zero, low, medium, and high rates of sea salt solutions were applied one time per week for 13 weeks (0, 17, 60, and 103 mol·m−3). When no salt damage was evident, the decision was made to double the rate (0, 34, 120, and 206 mol·m−3), and this protocol was continued for another 12 weeks. Plants were harvested on 15 Nov. 2006. A two-way factorial design with four randomized blocks was utilized. Irrigation between salt solution applications was via sprinkler when needed. Leachate readings via the pour-through method indicated that only one sprinkler irrigation was needed to bring substrate conductivity down to just above background. During the 24-hour exposure periods, roots were subjected to conductivities approaching 20 decisiemens/m with the high rates. In spite of doubling the rate in midcourse of this experiment, all plants survived and few exhibited salt damage symptoms. There was no significant salt rate effect on growth, as determined by the wet weight of aboveground parts. There were genotype differences. The hybrid produced higher wet weights than BC and MC. However, MC exhibited the greatest increase in height of the three genotypes. The explanation is growth habit differences. The cutting-grown hybrid was heavily branched and plagiotropic, while MC enjoyed a strong leader. Na concentration in Taxodium leaves increased as sea salt concentrations increased. The K:Na ratio in Taxodium leaves decreased as salt concentration increased. Of three Taxodium genotypes, BC exhibited the highest leaf content of Na, Ca, and S; MC had the lowest leaf content of Na, Ca, and S; the hybrid was in-between. Work plans include repeating this experiment but at much higher rates, and field trials of germplasm in saline locations in East Texas.\n\nInfluence of a Modified Pot-in-pot Production Strategy on Root Temperature and Growth of Rhododendron × ‘Mrs. G.G. Gerbing’ in Full Sun\n\nBrennan Whitehead* and David Creech, Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 13000, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX 75962\n\nIn Texas, container plants in nurseries can experience excessive container temperatures, particularly during the hot summer months. Root damage can be severe and plant quality can lower. A raised bed, double-row pot-in-pot production research plot (200 ft × 6 ft) was established at the north end of the SFA Mast Arboretum with sockets in a triangular design with plants 24 inches apart in rows 8 inches apart (3.45 square ft per socket pot). This design was basically a modification of the Jay Fraleigh Nursery GRO-ECO (U.S. Patent No. 6,865,845) strategy in a full sun site. This study monitored the influence of black or white weed barrier, or whether a “mid-irrigation line” was used or not on growth of Rhododendron ‘Mrs. G.G. Gerbing’ plants. The mid-irrigation line (emitters 12 inches apart) was oriented between the two rows of socket pots and intended to apply light, frequent irrigations in such a way that they cool the soil and nearby socket pots. A randomized block design was used with six blocks containing the four treatments. A total of 196 azalea containers used in this portion of the study, which began 7 Apr. 2006 and was terminated 7 Oct. 2006. All plants were irrigated with a single emitter. Records of the time and volume of irrigation were kept throughout the study. The rate and timing of fertilization (OsmocoteR 18–6–12) were adjusted throughout the trial based on conductivity readings. The growth and root temperature data from the pot-in-pot research plot were compared to data collected from a full sun aboveground container area and a 50% shade house area. Temperature readings were taken at the edge, center, and bottom of the containers in the three areas during the hottest time of the summer. Plant height and dry weight were measured at the termination of the experiment. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed on the temperature data. A randomized block ANOVA test was performed on the dry weight and height of the plants. When statistically analyzed, there were no significant differences in container temperatures or growth between the four treatments. The pot-in-pot azaleas were superior when compared to plants grown in a nearby full sun aboveground area and the 50% shade house by the horticulture facility. While not analyzed because of location differences, the pot-in-pot azaleas were more uniform, of good color, and had a strong root system.\n\nConsumer Preference and Postharvest Life of Field-grown Fresh-cut Sunflowers\n\nKara Howard*1, Ellen Peffley1, Jorge Vizcarra2, and Chad Davis3, 1Department of Plant and Soil Science, P.O. Box 42122, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX 79409; 2Department of Animal and Food Sciences, P.O. Box 42141, Lubbock, TX 79409; 3Department of Agricultural Education and Communications, P.O. Box 42131, Lubbock, TX 79404\n\nThere is a developing market for field-grown cut flowers in Texas. The overall goal of this study was to identify a floral crop that could be field grown in the Texas South Plains and marketed freshly-cut. A survey of Lubbock, Texas, florists revealed sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.) were favored by most. Sunflower is a crop grown on 54,000 acres in Texas harvested for either seed or oil. Since agronomic cultivars were already in production in our area, they were included in this study to determine if they had value as a cut flower crop. Eight agronomic and eight ornamental sunflower cultivars were grown in a variety trial in Summer 2006 in a completely randomized block design. To learn which cultivar consumers preferred, a study was conducted where stems were harvested and photographed when blooms were at “partly open” and “fully open” stages. Florists and Texas Tech University students participated in an online sunflower cultivar survey that included the sunflower images, where florists were asked if they would use the cultivar for sale, and students if they would buy the cultivar. Mean ratings of responses were determined for each cultivar. Both groups gave high mean ratings to agronomic and ornamental cultivars. Florists responded they would sell agronomic cultivars and students responded they would buy agronomic cultivars. Demographic data were collected and are being analyzed. In a second study, postharvest life of cut stems was investigated. When ray florets were open 45°, stems were harvested and held in double-distilled (DD) water or floral preservative in a factorial arrangement of treatments. Ten days is an industry standard for postharvest life of cut flowers. Most sunflower cultivars in this study met or exceeded the 10-day mark regardless if held in DD water or floral preservative. Some cultivars demonstrated a significantly longer postharvest life when in floral preservative than when in DD water. Significant differences in postharvest life also occurred between some cultivars.\n\nTiming of Herbicide Application Affects Weed Control\n\nDiana R. Cochran*1, Charles H. Gilliam1, D.J. Eakes1, Glenn R. Wehtje1, Patricia R. Knight2, and James Altland3, 1101 Funchess Hall, Department of Horticulture, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849; 2Mississippi State University, Coastal Research and Extension Center, Biloxi, MS 39532; 3North Willamette Research and Extension Center, Oregon State University, Aurora, OR 97002\n\nThis study evaluated three herbicides, BroadStar (150 lb/acre), Rout (100 lb/acre), and Snapshot (200 lb/acre), applied at 0, 3, 7, and 10 days after seeding (DAS) trade gallon containers with Eclipta alba (eclipta) or Euphorbia maculata (spotted spurge) at 25 seed per container. Each container was filled with a pinebark : sand 6:1 (v:v) medium amended with Polyon 17–6–12 (17N–2.6P–10K) at 6.35 kg·m−1 control-release fertilizer, dolomitic lime at 2.27 kg·m−1, and micromax at 0.89 kg·m−1. Data were collected at 7, 14, 28, 38, 45, and 60 DAS and weed fresh weights at 60 DAS. Results indicated BroadStar, Rout, and Snapshot applied at either 0 or 3 DAS resulted in similar eclipta and spotted spurge control. When comparing eclipta numbers at 7 and 28 DAS, weed numbers were reduced by BroadStar (87%), Rout (70%), and Snapshot (48%) when applied at 7 DAS. Similarly, eclipta numbers were reduced by BroadStar (85%), Rout (73%), and Snapshot (48%) when applied at 10 DAS. With spotted spurge, weed number was reduced at 28 DAS when BroadStar (94%), Rout (85%), and Snapshot (51%) were applied 7 DAS. Similarly, at 10 DAS spotted spurge number was reduced by BroadStar (96%), Rout (56%), and Snapshot (53%) at 28 DAS. These data show BroadStar, Rout, and Snapshot have limited postemergent control of Eclipta alba and Euphorbia maculata when applied soon after germination.\n\nGrowth Modification of Bedding Plants using ChromatiNeting\n\nCharles R. McElhannon*, R.J. Kessler, G.J. Keever, and W.G. Foshee, Horticulture Department, Auburn University, 101 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849\n\nCommercial markets require growers of bedding plants to produce a product which has uniform height and is within preset specifications. Chemical applications of plant growth retardants (PGRs) have been used for decades to reduce internode extension. The use of photoselective filters as an alternative to PGRs has been studied since the early 1990s and has been shown to modify plant growth. Five colors of ChromatiNeting, a photoselective filter produced by Polysac, were used to determine growth responses of six bedding plants (Dianthus barbatus ‘Dynasty Red’, Lycopersicon lycopersicum ‘Sun Leaper’, Capsicum annuum ‘Sweet X3R Camelot Hybrid’, Ipomoea tricolor ‘Crimson Rambler’, Brassica oleracea ‘Patron’, and Brassica oleracea ‘Blue Vantage’) in a double polycarbonate greenhouse in Auburn, AL. Each ChromatiNeting color and a control of ambient light conditions were replicated 3 times in a randomized complete-block design. Plant height and two widths, from which a growth index was calculated, were measured at 2 and 5 weeks after transplanting. Black ChromatiNeting reduced shoot height in dianthus, pepper, morning glory, broccoli, and cabbage but shoot height was the same as blue and gray in several cases. Pearl ChromatiNeting yielded the tallest plants in tomato, pepper, morning glory, broccoli, and cabbage but these plants were the same height as ambient light or red in several cases. Black ChromatiNeting resulted in the lower GI in dianthus, tomato, pepper, morning glory, broccoli, and cabbage but blue and gray resulted in the same GI in several cases. Pearl ChromatiNeting yielded larger GI in dianthus, tomato, pepper, morning glory, broccoli, and cabbage but ambient light and red resulted in the same GI in several cases. ChromatiNeting has potential as a growth-modifying photoselective filter; however, more studies are needed to identify responses of different species.\n\nThe Effect of Drought on Root Growth of Two Native Landscape Shrub Species\n\nMatthew F. Wilkin*, Amy N. Wright, Robert C. Ebel, and D. Joe Eakes, 101 Funchess Hall, Horticulture Department, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849\n\nUnderstanding plant response to drought can provide insight into irrigation requirements and relative drought tolerance of landscape shrub species. The objective of this study was to utilize the Horhizotron™ to evaluate root growth of Myrica cerifera L. (wax myrtle) and Illicium floridanum Ellis (Florida anise tree) when portions of the root system are exposed to different levels of soil moisture. Myrica cerifera and I. floridanum were placed in Horhizotrons on 9 Feb. and 15 June, respectively. Quadrants were filled with Greens Grade™ Profile™ amended at a standard nursery rate. Four irrigation frequencies were randomly assigned to quadrants in each Horhizotron: substrate watered daily (≈20% moisture by volume), substrate rewatered once dried to 15% moisture, substrate rewatered once dried to 10% moisture, and an unwatered substrate. Daily 400 mL water was applied to the root ball, and when watered, quadrants received 400 mL water. Weekly root growth measurements were taken by measuring horizontal root length (parallel to the ground) of five longest roots visible on each side of a quadrant. Dry weight of roots in each quadrant was determined for M. cerifera and I. floridanum on 79 and 107 days after planting, respectively. Myrica cerifera root lengths were lowest in the unwatered substrate, while root lengths in all other substrates did not differ. Illicium floridanum root lengths in the substrate watered daily and in that rewatered at 15% moisture were similar and higher than in substrate rewatered at 10% moisture or in the unwatered substrate. Myrica cerifera root dry weight was lower in the unwatered substrate than in the well-watered substrate, similar to root lengths. Illicium floridanum root dry weights in the daily watered treatment and in that rewatered at 15% moisture were similar and higher than in the other substrates. This experiment indicates that root growth of M. cerifera and I. floridanum can persist as long as some portion of the root system is receiving some water.\n\nMulch Type Influences Root Growth of Native Woody Shrub Species\n\nJulie L. Guckenberger* and Amy N. Wright, Department of Horticulture, 101 Funchess Hall, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849\n\nDevelopment of a root system into the surrounding soil is essential for survival of transplanted container-grown plants. The need for reliable planting techniques that encourage root growth in adverse conditions has prompted research into planting above grade. Myrica cerifera (wax myrtle) and Illicium floridanum (Florida anise tree) plants were removed from their containers and planted in Horhizotrons in a greenhouse in Auburn, Ala., on 1 Mar. and 6 June 2006, respectively. The Horhizotron contains four glass quadrants extending away from the root ball, providing a nondestructive method for measuring root growth over time of roots of the same plant into different rhizosphere conditions. Each quadrant was filled with 100% soil in the lower 10 cm. The upper 10 cm of the quadrants were filled randomly with either: 1) pine bark (PB); 2) peat (P); 3) cotton gin compost (CGC); or 4) more soil (100% soil, no mulch control). This practice was intended to simulate the above-grade planting practice with the lower half the root ball in soil and upper half in mulch. Horizontal root lengths (length measured parallel to the ground) of the five longest roots visible along each side of a quadrant were measured weekly. At 44 days after planting (DAP), roots of M. cerifera were longer in quadrants with CGC or P than in PB or 100% soil, and roots grew into both the upper mulch and lower soil layers. Myrica cerifera root dry weights were similar among treatments, illustrating the importance of measuring root length over time to determine extent of root development laterally into the treatments. At 115 DAP, roots of I. floridanum were longest in quadrants with P or PB than in CGC or 100% soil, and roots grew mostly into the mulch layers. Illicium floridanum root dry weights were highest in P and PB. Results suggest that utilizing the above-grade planting technique can increase post-transplant root growth of native woody shrubs over traditional planting in 100% soil.\n\nUsing Degree Days to Predict Nitrogen Mineralization from Organic Amendments\n\nAlejandra Sierra*1, Danielle Treadwell1, Eric Simonne1, and Donald Graetz2, 1Department of Horticultural Science, P.O. Box 110690, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0690; 2Soil and Water Science Department, P.O. Box 110510, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0510\n\nCrop nutrition in organic production is based mainly on the decomposition of plant and animal-based organic amendments. Environmental factors such as temperature play an important role in the mineralization and nitrification of nitrogen (N). In the past, growing degree days have been successfully used to predict N release from crop residues and manures. A 5-week study was conducted during two seasons (spring and summer) and two locations (greenhouse and lab) to evaluate the utility of cumulative degree days (CDD) for predicting the ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3 −-N) release rate from five organic amendments: blood meal (BLM), feather meal (FM), bone meal (BM), rock phosphate (RP) and potassium magnesium sulfate (SPM) and two controls: an inorganic fertilizer (CON) and potting media with no amendment (NA). Amendments were mixed with an approved organic potting media at a 1 to 5 ratio and maintained at constant moisture. Temperature of the air was recorded in 15-minute intervals using a data logger and was used to calculate degree days (DD). The NH4 +-N and NO3 −-N release rates were determined from leachate samples taken every week throughout the study. The rate of NH4 +-N and NO3 −-N release rates increased with increasing temperature, and could be predicted across locations and seasons using CDD. NH4 +-N cumulative release rate from NA (Y = 0.00029CDD, R2 = 0.35), FM (Y = 0.003845 CDD, R2 = 0.61), BLM (Y = 0.03630CDD, R2 = 0.62) and CON (Y = 0.0139CDD, R2 = 0.95) had a linear response to CCD. Similar to NH4 +-N, NO3 −-N release rates had a linear response to CDD for all treatments (NA Y = 0.00219CDD, R2 = 0.28; FM Y = –2.26 + 0.01029CDD, R2 = 0.76; BLM Y = –1.92 + 0.00878CDD, R2 = 0.73; BM Y = 0.01087CDD, R2 = 0.54; RP Y = 0.0039CDD, R2 = 0.29; SPM Y = 1.176 + 0.0025CDD, R2 = 0.60; CON Y = 1.29 + 0.0367CDD, R2 = 0.98). Degree days are a potential tool to predict N mineralization and nitrification from organic amendments, and therefore synchronize release with plant N requirements.\n\nSudden Inundation Effects on Urban Landscape Plants\n\nKaren Blackburn* and Ed Bush, LSU AgCenter Department of Horticulture, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803-1068\n\nOn 29 Aug. 2005 Hurricane Katrina caused significant flooding of the New Orleans metropolitan area for durations of up to 4 weeks in certain locations. A study to evaluate the differential urban landscape plant survival was initiated 1 Oct. 2006. Nine woody ornamental species were evaluated for sudden inundation tolerance. Plant species evaluated included three groundcovers (asian jasmine, liriope, and green mondograss, three shrub species (azalea, japanese yew, yaupon holly) and three tree species (crape myrtle, live oak, southern magnolia). Inundation treatments consisted of three depths (0%, 50%, and 100% of canopy) and two durations (2 and 4 weeks). Species, flooding depth, and duration affected each species differently. Asian jasmine at both durations and depths resulted in mortality. Liriope and mondograss showed tolerance at 50% and 100% flooding depths and both durations. Azalea plants submerged for both depths resulted in a reduction in plant quality. Plants submerged at 100% for both 2 and 4 weeks resulted in dead plants as witnessed in New Orleans following Katrina. Japanese yew leaves submerged at 50% were damaged, but leaves surviving above the waterline remained intact. These plants seemed to localize foliar damage. Yaupon holly plants showed similar results. Southern magnolia trees resulted in complete mortality with 50% and 100% inundation and both depths. Crape myrtle plants showed no differences among inundation treatments of 50% and 100%. All treatments showed decreased quality compared to the control. Magnolia trees in the most damaged sections of New Orleans also resulted in mortality. Live oak trees performed best of the three tree species. Although inundation treatments reduced plant quality, trees survived both flooding depths and durations. Overall, the results of the inundation study were similar to the actual flooding from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nWarren S. Barham PhD Graduate Student Paper Competition\n\nSemi-quantitative Measurement of Carotenoid Development in Four Watermelon Colors: A Discussion of the Impact of Ploidy and Other Genetic Factors\n\nJennifer Waters*1, Haejeen Bang1, Angela Davis2, Daniel Leskovar3, and Stephen King1, 1Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center Department of Horticultural Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843; 2SCARL, USDA-ARS, Lane, OK 74555; 3VFIC, Department of Horticultural Sciences, TAES, Uvalde, TX 78801\n\nCarotenoids are important health-promoting compounds which act through their anti-oxidant activity to reduce the risk of some cancers, heart disease, macular degeneration, and may even improve immune responses. Watermelon is an important source of lycopene and other carotenoids. Understanding the development of these compounds in the growing fruit may improve our ability to promote increased levels or accumulation of specific carotenoids. This study measured the accumulation of 35 carotenoid species at four time points post-pollination (10, 20, 40, and 55 days) in four watermelon colors at two ploidy levels (2n and 3n). The resulting patterns of development align well with putative dominance regiments, known points of mutation in the pathway, and may be able to predict other disruptions leading to color change. From this, hypotheses about regulation of the watermelon carotenogenic pathway were formulated. Finally, this developmental data show fundamental differences in patterns of carotenoid development between diploid and triploid varieties. It is critical to understand the construction and regulation of the carotenoid pathway before successful attempts can be made in manipulating the pathway to obtain a product of even higher health-promoting potential.\n\nClean Chip Residual Substrate for Container-grown Perennials: Effect of Supplemental Nitrogen Rates\n\nCheryl R. Boyer*1, Glenn B. Fain2, Charles H. Gilliam1, Thomas V. Gallagher3, H. Allen Torbert4, and Jeff L. Sibley1, 1101 Funchess Hall, Horticulture Department, Auburn Univ., Auburn, AL 36849; 2USDA–ARS Southern Horticultural Laboratory, Poplarville, MS 39470; 3Department of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849; 4USDA–ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory, Auburn, AL 36832\n\nClean chip residual (CCR) is composed of pinebark (PB) (≈42%), needles (≈9%), and wood (≈49%) from residue remaining after in-field harvesting of pine wood chips for the paper industry. This study utilized aged (6 months) pinebark and fresh CCR in combination with four rates of supplemental nitrogen (0, 0.23, 0.45, 0.68 kg·m−3 N; 42N–0P–0K Polyon coated urea). Treatments were amended with 6.35 kg·m−3 Polyon 18N–2.6P–10K, 2.27 kg·m−3 dolomitic limestone and 0.68 kg·m−3 MicroMax. On 6 June 2006 liners (72 cell pack) of buddleia (Buddleia davidii ‘Pink Delight’), gaura (Gaura lindheimeri ‘Siskiyou Pink’), and coreopsis (Coreopsis rosea ‘Sweet Dreams’) were transplanted into (2.8-L) containers, placed outside in full sun, and overhead irrigated as needed. Pour-through extractions were conducted at 1, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after planting (DAP) to determine pH and electrical conductivity (EC). Leaf chlorophyll content was quantified at 30, 60, and 100 DAP on buddleia. Growth indices were recorded at 30, 60, and 90 DAP. Flower numbers were counted at 60 and 90 DAP (buddleia). Substrate shrinkage was recorded at 7 and 90 DAP. Shoot dry weight and percent rootball coverage were recorded at 100 DAP. Plant growth indices (90 DAP), percent rootball coverage, shoot dry weight, and substrate shrinkage at the end of the study were similar among all species for substrate and fertilizer effects. Leaf chlorophyll content of buddleia was also similar at 90 DAP for all treatments. Flower number was similar for both substrate and fertilizer effect for buddleia at 90 DAP and gaura at 60 DAP while coreopsis exhibited a slight substrate effect at 60 DAP with plants grown in PB having more flowers than those grown in CCR. EC and pH levels were within acceptable ranges throughout the study. Results indicate that buddliea, gaura, and coreopsis exhibit similar growth when grown in PB or CCR and do not require supplemental nitrogen during production.\n\nIdentification of Molecular Markers Associated with Sweetpotato Resistance to Sweet Potato Virus Disease\n\nDouglas W. Miano*1, Don R. LaBonte1, and Christopher A. Clark2, 1Department of Horticulture, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Louisiana Agricultural Experimental Station, Baton Rouge, LA 70803; 2Department of Plant Pathology and Crop Physiology, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Louisiana Agricultural Experimental Station, Baton Rouge, LA 70803\n\nA total of 47 unrelated sweetpotato genotypes were selected and classified into two phenotypic groups as resistant or susceptible to sweet potato virus disease (SPVD). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker profiles were generated for each individual and used in association studies to identify markers suitable for identification of plants possessing a resistant reaction to SPVD. AMOVA analysis found significant (P < 0.002) variation between the two phenotypic groups using 206 polymorphic AFLP markers. Discriminant analysis and logistic regression statistical methods were used to select informative markers, and to develop models that would classify the two groups. A training set of 30 (from the 47) genotypes, consisting of 15 grouped as resistant and 15 grouped as susceptible, was used to develop the classification models. Four similar markers, which gave a 100% correct classification of the training set, were selected by both discriminant and logistic regression analysis. A classification model consisting of the four markers gave a 94% correct classification of the 17 genotypes used as test groups.\n\nMorphological and Physiological Studies on Liriope and Ophiopogon Species\n\nCatherine Broussard*and Ed Bush, 128 Julian C. Miller Hall, Department of Horticulture, LSU Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803\n\nMorphological and physiological studies have been performed on liriope and ophiopogon (collectively referred to as liriopogons) to gain factual evidence and clear up misnomers in the nursery industry. Flower and root characteristics have been described to assist green industry professionals in distinguishing between liriope and ophiopogon in addition to the individual species within these two genera. Root and flower morphology of 19 commonly used liriopogon cultivars were studied and categorized into two genera and eight species using taxonomic keys previously established by L.H. Bailey and H. Harold Hume. These were Liripe muscari (erect flowers, superior ovaries, tufted root system), L. spicata (erect flowers, superior ovaries, rhizomatous root system), L. exiflora (erect flowers, superior ovaries, rhizomatous root systems), L. gigantea (erect flowers, superior ovaries, rhizomatous root system); Ophiopogon japonicus (drooping flowers, semi inferior ovaries, rhizomatous root system), O. jaburan (drooping flowers, semi-inferior ovaries, tufted root system) and O. planiscapus (drooping flowers, semi inferior ovaries, rhizomatous root system). 13C and 15N analysis was performed on two species, resulting in determination of C3 mode of photosynthesis for liriopogons. Future studies will be performed on species by comparing root and flower characteristics of known species. This will assist the nursery industry in categorizing new cultivars such as ‘Cleopatra’, ‘Marc Anthony’, and ‘Emerald Goddess’.\n\nVariation in Ecophysiological Traits of Mexican Pecan Provenances\n\nMadhulika Sagaram*1, Leonardo Lombardini1, and L.J.Grauke2, 1Department of Horticultural Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-2133; 2Pecan Genetics and Breeding Program, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 10200 FM50, Somerville, TX 77879\n\nAn assessment of leaf physiological traits of pecan provenances growing in Sommerville, Texas, was conducted during Summer 2006. The trees representing the provenances were grown from seeds collected from 19 locations chosen within the native range of pecan distribution. Thirteen sites were located in Mexico and six in the United States. The objective of the study was to provide an understanding of patterns of geographic variation within the natural range for physiological (net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, photosynthetic efficiency, and instantaneous water use efficiency) traits. No differences in net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and instantaneous water use efficiency were observed between provenances. The study showed that photosynthetic efficiency of the tested provenances were significantly different (P < 0.05) in July as well as Aug. 2006. The provenance obtained from Saucillo (western Mexico) showed the highest values of photosynthetic efficiency during both the July and August measurements, whereas the provenances from eastern Mexico showed the lowest values. These results suggest that pecan provenances from a dry environment have a higher photosynthetic efficiency than provenances from humid environments. This study could provide useful information for a breeding program aimed at developing more drought-tolerant cultivars.\n\nObstacles to the Determination of Nitrogen Loads from Field-grown Tomatoes\n\nAparna Gazula*1, Eric Simonne1, Michael D. Dukes2, George J. Hochmuth1, Robert Hochmuth3, and David W. Studstill1, 1Horticultural Sciences Department, 1241 Fifield Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0690; 2Agricultual and Biological Engineering Department, 107 Frazier Rogers Hall, P.O. Box 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611; 3North Florida Research and Education Center–Suwannee Valley, 7580 County Road 136, Live Oak, FL 32060\n\nWith the development of total maximum daily load legislation, in-field nutrient load measurements are required to assess the impact of land use on groundwater quality. Our objective was to determine the effects of a combination of fertilizer and irrigation programs (N fertilizer at 100% or 200% IFAS recommended, and irrigation at 100% or 300% IFAS recommended rates) on soil mineral N load using three different width estimates: mean wetted width, maximum wetted width, and raised bed width under a plasticultured crop. Based on previous studies, we assumed 1) a rate of 2 cm/day of vertical water movement, 2) seasonal water movement of less than 1.5-m depth, and 3) a uniform distribution of fertilizer in the wetted zone. ‘Florida 47’ tomatoes were grown on Lakeland fine sand during 2005 and 2006. At the end of the tomato crop (75–80 days after transplanting), 1.5-m-deep soil samples were collected at the drip tape emitter from all the treatments. Seasonal NO3-N + NH4-N load from the six treatments ranged from 0.77 to 1.20 kg·ha−1, which was less than expected. Moreover, the coefficient of variation was 86%. The results suggest that the assumption that fertilizer is uniformly distributed in the wetted zone was likely incorrect and a high leaching zone may exist immediately below the drip tape. It is also likely that the rate of vertical water movement was greater than 2 cm/day, thereby moving fertilizer deeper than 1.5 m. Hence, sampling procedures for load determination from drip-irrigated plasticultured crops should be done multiple times and/or from greater depths, and should take into account nutrient distribution in the soil.\n\nExtension Section\n\nSuccess of the Pecan Management Course at Oklahoma State University\n\nEric T. Stafne*, B. Dean McCraw, and Becky L. Carroll, 360 Agricultural Hall, Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Stillwater, OK 74078\n\nThe pecan management course at Oklahoma State University is now in its 10th year. Initially it began as a 1- or 2-day course, but has expanded to being taught over a 9-month period. The current course has 32 student contact hours over eight class periods. New leadership of the course has prompted investigations into past attendance for needs assessment of future courses. Attendance numbers were compiled to determine appropriate course length, months in which to hold the course, and to discern any patterns evident over the 10-year period. An average of 33 persons attend the course per year with an average of 72% attendance over all months. Classes have varied in their average attendance over the 10 years, ranging from 57% attendance to 86%. Attendance appears to increase following “on” pecan harvest years and fall following “off” years. Price obtained for pecans may be a factor, but its impact was not immediately evident. Classes held early in the year are better attended than those during the summer, especially the month of August, likely due to competition with other activities. The data derived from past courses will allow for decision-making to improve course attendance in the future.\n\nSo, You Wanted to Accept the Null Hypothesis? Analysis and Interpretation of Fertilizer Trials in the BMP Era\n\nEric Simonne*, Monica Ozores-Hampton, Ramon Littell, Meagan Brennan, and Aparna Gazula, University of Florida, Horticultural Sciences Department, Gainesville, FL 32611-0690\n\nWith the development of best management practices, fertilizer recommendations have to reconcile profitability with environmental stewardship. On-farm fertilizer demonstrations and trials are needed to 1) validate statewide recommendations under different growing systems; 2) propose adjustments where needed; and 3) facilitate growers’ adoption. Statistical techniques such as analysis of variance, mean separation tests, and polynomial regression may not be enough when yield differences that need to be detected based on economical considerations are small compared to the inherent variability of field data. For example, using current prices, it takes approximately 4 to 10 25-lb/acre boxes of tomato to offset the price of N at 100 lbs/acre. Detecting yield differences of this magnitude may require an unpractical number of replications. Binomial distribution, power calculation, and nonlinear regression should also be considered for the analysis of on-farm fertilizer trials.\n\nTeaching through Games\n\nMary Lamberts* and Christian Miller, UF Miami–Dade County Extension, 18710 SW 288th St., Homestead, FL 33030\n\nThe authors used two different “games” as Extension teaching strategies with several diverse audiences and have found advantages and disadvantages for both games. The first “game” is an exercise where participants had to find job-related information on program-specific pesticide labels and record it as teams or individuals. The second “game” is a variation on the television game show Jeopardy. For both games, the team or individuals with the most correct answers “wins” some type of “prize.” Audiences for the label reading games included Miami–Dade County Parks and Recreation Department employees, South Florida Aquatic Plant Management Society workshop attendees, and members of the South Florida Golf Course Superintendents Association. The two Jeopardy audiences included participants in a pesticide review class and a continuing education unit (CEU) workshop. Materials for the label game include portions of pesticide labels using a different color paper for each label, a worksheet on either legal or ledger paper, and a supply of pens or pencils. The Jeopardy game needs “money” and the game itself. Audience-appropriate “prizes” for the winning team or individual(s) are needed for both games.\n\nProblems. When the label game was first used, instructors “graded” the results at the end of the session. This was very time consuming and difficult to do since some participants added unanticipated answers. A suggestion is to give teams the expected answers and possible points for each section and have each team's answers “graded” by another team. This would still allow for questions, but would greatly speed up the process. The problem with the Jeopardy games was that not all participants were equally familiar with the chosen subject matter categories. Some people knew most answers, while others just observed but may not have learned the desired information. This game has been more successful when used at the end of more traditional workshops since it serves as a novel review. Despite the problems, participants do enjoy learning through games. Games are highly interactive and can lead audience members to find information they might otherwise ignore. Prizes are expected, but are not the most important part.\n\nA Regional Training Program for Methyl Bromide Transition: Regulatory Update, Alternatives Research, and On-farm Projects\n\nR.M. Welker1, J.P. Smith*2, G.E. Fernandez3, D.W. Monks3, P.M. Brannen4, E.B. Poling3, and F.J. Louws1, 1Department of Plant Pathology, Gardner Hall 3403, Box 7616, NCSU Campus, Raleigh, NC 27695; 2CUCES–Lexington County, 605 W. Main St. Suite 109, Lexington, SC 29072; 3Department of Horticultural Sciences, Kilgore Hall 128, Box 7609, NCSU Campus, Raleigh, NC 27695; 4Department of Plant Pathology, 2106 Miller Plant Sciences Bldg., University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602\n\nA 2-year in-service training program supported by the Southern Region IPM Center, Southern Region Small Fruit Consortium, and the USDA Methyl Bromide Alternatives Program has familiarized 61 county agents and certified crop advisors with the current status of methyl bromide regulatory and availability issues, new concepts in mulch film technology, and completed and ongoing research into methyl bromide alternatives. Also, attendees reviewed and critiqued on-farm research/demonstration projects designed to show growers currently available methyl bromide alternatives, as well as discussing and planning needed on-farm work for the future. The training involved both classroom and hands-on activities designed along the “Train-the-Trainer” model in order to facilitate extension of the information to growers and other users of methyl bromide. Notebooks to be used in further training exercises were distributed and contained information on methyl bromide alternatives research, calibration spreadsheets for applications of methyl bromide alternatives using existing application equipment, high-barrier mulch film technology, and product information for new application equipment and techniques.\n\nMaking Fire Ants Easier to Live with: Alabama Cooperative Extension System's Fire Ant Education Program\n\nKathy Flanders*, 201 Extension Hall, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, Auburn University, AL 36849\n\nSince 2000, the Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) and the Alabama Fire Ant Management Program have conducted educational programs on imported fire ant management. Our sustainable approach to fire ant management makes fire ants easier to live with while reducing social, economic, and environmental costs. A tiered training approach was used. In 2000, forty county extension agents were trained in fire ant management. In 2001, educational publications and teaching materials were developed with input from these agents (www.aces.edu/dept/fireants). From 2002 to 2004, agents trained the next tier of trainers, called fire ant management advisers. By teaching those who are likely to pass on their knowledge, we multiplied our own training efforts. We estimate the impact of this program to be $1.3 million annually. Results from pre- and post-testing showed that we increased the knowledge of our fire ant management advisers by 29%. For every dollar spent we get at least $30 in savings for our stakeholders. In 2004, extension agents continued to conduct fire ant education programs. In addition, they started field demonstrations of bait-based management programs. Beginning in 2006, specialists and agents from ACES have been involved in developing imported fire ant eXtension, using a grant obtained from eXtension. The Alabama Cooperative Extension System is the lead institution on the grant. Imported fire ant eXtension will be launched to the public in Apr. 2006. Several other organizations have collaborated with ACES in implementing this program. Our partners include the Alabama Fire Ant Management Program, Alabama A&M University, USDA–ARS, USDA–APHIS, the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries, the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, the Southern Region SARE Professional Development Program, and eXtension.\n\nGrowing Farmers and Establishing Local Markets\n\nJohn Braswell*1 and Nana Mejia2, 1Mississippi State University, P.O. Box 193, Poplarville, MS 39470; 2National Center for Appropriate Technology, 106 Crape Myrtle Circle, Covington, LA 70433\n\nLocal direct markets for selling locally grown food products in Mississippi are very disorganized and largely nonexistent. There are many benefits to local markets to growers, consumers, and communities for health, economic and sociological reasons. There is growing interest and support in local markets from community leaders, consumers, and growers. An organization originated from Loyola University, marketumbrella.org, has an excellent program to develop high quality farmers’ markets and work with market managers. After Hurricane Katrina, several organizations took an interest in South Mississippi and identified the lack of local food systems as a serious deficiency. Grants were given by the Kellogg Foundation and Ford Foundation to Mississippi State University (MSU) Extension, National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT), marketumbrella.org, the Ocean Springs Fresh Market, and the Moss Point Market to develop local food systems. MSU and NCAT's function was to develop growers. Three workshops were held to instruct growers on fruit and vegetable crop production and diversification, crop scheduling and season extension, marketing techniques and options, community development considerations, value added options, food safety, grading and handling, and postharvest practices. Growers became familiar with their production and marketing options and made decisions on the best marketing avenues for their farm. A number of the growers involved in the workshops have gone on to grow and sell at the various markets they learned about at the workshops. Several have developed value added products and all have improved their marketing techniques so they are more successful at marketing their products.\n\nFruit Crops Section\n\nVirus Diseases of Blackberry and Raspberries\n\nRobert R. Martin*1, Rose C. Gergerich2, James Susaimuthu3, and Ioannis E. Tzanetakis4, 1USDA-ARS Horticulture Crops Research Lab, Corvallis, OR; Department of Plant Pathology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR; Department of Plant Pathology, Cornell University, Cornell, NY; and Department of Molecular Biology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR\n\nTwo viruses have been associated with Blackberry yellow vein disease (BYVD). One of these viruses, Blackberry yellow vein associated virus (BYVaV) is a member of the genus Crinivirus and has been identified in blackberries exhibiting the BYVD in several states in the southeastern US. If consistent with known criniviruses, BYVaV should be transmitted by whiteflies, although this has not yet been demonstrated. A second virus, designated as Blackberry virus Y (BVY), is a member of the family Potyviridae, but lacks the signature DAG motif and therefore it likely will not be transmitted by aphids. It lacks several common features of the family and contains an alkB domain, suggesting it may represent a new genus in this virus family. The vector of this virus has not yet been determined, but eriophyid mites and aphids are being tested. In some cultivars of blackberry, these viruses in single infections do not cause symptoms. When both viruses are present, dramatic leaf symptoms and plant decline are observed. BVY has not been identified in all symptomatic plants, suggesting there may be other viruses that in combination with BYVaV are able to cause BYVD. In red raspberry, the possibility of a virus complex being responsible for severe crumbly fruit rather than single infections with Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) is being investigated. Two viruses have been identified from red raspberry that exhibited a chlorotic leaf flecking and were free of RBDV. Based on partial sequence analysis, these viruses should be aphid transmitted. One of the viruses belongs to the genus Closterovirus and has been identified in raspberry material from Washington and Scotland. It has also been found in several isolates of raspberry leaf spot and raspberry leaf mottle from Scotland, suggesting it may be a component of the raspberry mosaic complex. Recent work with developing control strategies for Tomato ringspot virus and RBDV will also be presented\n\nToward the Perfect Blackberry in Cultivar Development\n\nJohn R. Clark Department of Horticulture, 316 Plant Science, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701\n\nExcellent progress has been made in the last 40+ years to improve quality, fruit size, productivity, plant adaptation, thornlessness, and other characteristics in cultivar options of southern blackberries. These improvements have contributed to expansion in blackberry production, initially for local and pick-your-own sales, and more recently in expanded retail marketing through shipping of fruit. Further expansion is occurring worldwide where blackberries can be grown and markets are available to sell the fruit profitably. Envisioning further improvement toward the “perfect” blackberry allows one to dream of what can be done to make this small fruit crop more desirable by consumers, marketers, and growers. The first area of focus toward perfection is on fruit quality, with an emphasis on sweeter berries. Soluble solids content of 10% or more is recognized by consumers to be much improved over that of wild berries or older cultivars. Flavor aspects such as reduced acidity levels and enhanced flavor components can further expand consumption. Other fruit quality characteristics such as reduced seediness, retention of black color, lack of berry leakiness, freedom from mold, and others can be improved further. Berry size and productivity continue to be areas of focus in breeding, and adequate variation exists for these traits to allow more advances to be made. Plant adaptation has become a more substantial issue as production expands to lower-chilling environments. Variation in chilling requirement plus the incorporation of the primocane fruiting trait will facilitate blackberry production expansion to occur with better adapted cultivars. This an exciting time for blackberries, and the road to “perfection” is unfolding in further cultivar improvement.\n\nEvaluation of Blackberry Production Systems\n\nJim Pitts* and Robert Boozer, Auburn University, Chilton Research and Extension Center, 120 County Rd. 756, Clanton, AL 35045\n\nThree trellis systems were evaluated for harvest efficiency, fruit yield and fruit quality for two blackberry varieties, ‘Apache’ (thornless type) and ‘Kiowa’ (thorny type). Results were recorded during the 2003-2006 harvest seasons. Trellis systems employed were freestanding, shift trellis (Stiles), and two-wire static trellis (Powell). Plant spacing was 2 feet in the row for the freestanding, and 4 ft in the row for the shift and two-wire static systems. Fruit were harvested two times per week. Fruit quality for ‘Kiowa’ was highest each season and harvest efficiency best 3 out of 4 years on the two-wire static trellis. Two years out of four, fruit yields of ‘Kiowi’ and net returns calculated per acre were highest for the shift trellis. ‘Apache’ did not perform well in this planting and berry size was not affected by trellis type.\n\nSymptomology of Simulated Herbicide Drift Injury in Grape\n\nJoseph G. Masabni*, University of Kentucky Research and Education Center, P.O. Box 469, Princeton, KY 42445\n\nGrape is a crop on the rise in Kentucky, with 30 operating wineries. Growers choose ideal locations for grape production. However, these same locations are also best suited for corn, soybean, or hay production. In the last few years, a lot of vineyards have been established in the areas heavily invested in corn or soybean. Consequently, complaints of drift injury on grapes have been reported when neighboring fields are sprayed with early season preplant burndown herbicides. In order to teach grape and non-grape growers the potential of herbicide drift injury on grapes and the symptoms of injury of various herbicides, an experiment was conducted at the research station in Princeton, Ky. The experiment consisted of agronomic herbicides not labeled for grape, and of herbicides currently labeled on grape, sprayed directly on the foliage at 1/100X, 1/10X, and 1/2X rates to simulate drift injury. The X rate is the low end of the labeled rate range specified for each herbicide. The experiment was applied twice in 2006, on June 23 or mid-season, and on July 27 or late season. Results varied with various herbicides and ranged from complete desiccation with triclopyr to minor leaf yellowing with atrazine, to no injury. 2,4-D and dicamba, sprayed at lower rates ranging from 1/1000X to 1/100X, didn't show any injury symptoms typical of growth regulators. It is speculated that the grapevines are more tolerant to 2,4-D and dicamba drift damage in mid and late season. This experiment will be repeated in 2007 to evaluate 2,4-D injury potential at the budbreak stage.\n\nEvaluation of 38 Peach Cultivars in Western Kentucky\n\nJoseph G. Masabni* and Dwight Wolfe, University of Kentucky Research and Education Center, P.O. Box 469, Princeton, KY 42445\n\nCultivar choice is one of the most important decisions every fruit producer makes. Although cultivar performance and fruit quality information is very useful, obtaining this information is time consuming, due to the time required for fruit trees to start production. It is also expensive due to the large number of cultivars available. In 2004, a block of 37 peach cultivars was planted. The phenology of each cultivar was recorded in 2005 and 2006. Also recorded in 2006, was yield, fruit size, and percent soluble sugars or Brix. The top three yielding peach cultivars in 2006 were ‘Glowingstar’, ‘PF 20-007’, and ‘Laurol’, with 68.5, 56.9, and 56.4 lb/tree, respectively. These top yielders didn't have the largest fruit size at harvest. The largest fruit size was collected from ‘Encore,’ ‘John Boy II’, and ‘PF Lucky 21’ with 11.3, 6.9, and 5.7 oz/fruit, respectively. PF 5B and PF 1 ripened 30 days before ‘Redhaven’, and ‘PF Lucky 13’ ripened 7 days before ‘Redhaven’, while ‘Snow Brite’, ‘PF 15A’, ‘RedStar’, and ‘Summer Breeze’ ripened on the same date as the standard ‘Redhaven’. The latest-maturing cultivars Encore, Snow Giant, and Laurol were harvested as last as 21 Aug. or 5 weeks after ‘Redhaven’. Soluble sugars or Brix ranged from 8% to 12%, a difference not easily detected by the human palate.\n\nPainting Your Way through Peach Culture\n\nKathryn C. Taylor1, Frank Funderburk2, and Wayne Mitchem3, 1Department of Horticulture, University of Georgia, Byron, GA 31008; 2Peach County, Cooperative Extension Service, University of Georgia, Fort Valley, GA 31030; 3Department of Horticultural Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695\n\nWhite exterior-grade paint, a common tool that can be implemented more widely and efficiently, was used for protection against herbicide damage to 1-year-old trees. Use of trunk painting is not a new idea for trunk protection from herbicides. Our intention was to determine if paint could be applied to young trees in bulk as a preplant preparation. Important to the viability of this technique is to determine what care must be taken to keep paint from some portions of the tree, for example, the roots or apical buds while placing paint on other portions of the tree, the trunk. Five paint treatments were implemented preplant: painting the entire tree, painting the trunk only, painting all but the roots, painting all but the apical buds or an unpainted control. Four herbicide treatments were used: flumioxazin, flumioxazin + crop oil, flumioxazin + paraquat, or paraquat. The best tree growth was observed in trees that received flumioxazin + crop oil treatment and paint treatments in which either the trunk only or all but the roots were painted. Poorest growth was observed when either the roots were painted or unpainted trees were exposed to either treatment including crop oil. The study indicates that bundles of trees may be inverted into paint up to the planting depth (not covering the roots with paint) as an inexpensive, efficient means of protection of the green bark from herbicide damage during the first year of culture.\n\nPreliminary Assessment of Captan Impact on Fruit Finish\n\nKathryn C. Taylor1 and Phillip Brannen2, 1Department of Horticulture, University of Georgia, Byron, GA 31008; 2Department of Plant Pathology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602\n\nA conventional recommendation for peaches grown in the Southeast has been that the fruit should not receive captan applications within 30 days of harvest to avoid inking. In recent history, we have been pushing that recommendation to only 20 days before harvest to allow for the use of this material as a resistance management tool against the loss of dimethylation inhibiting fungicides. Additionally, during the recent past we determined that implementation of daily brush cleaning on packing lines, reduced the level of powdered pesticide formulations like captan, which tended to build up on packingline brushes, contaminating fruit with unduly high levels during packing. Because captan is a particularly abrasive material we tested the hypothesis that the primary source of captan injury was physical and exacerbated by brushing during fruit packing. Our study demonstrates that application of captan even within 4 days of harvest did not significantly increase inking when packed over clean packing line brushes. However, contamination of packing line brushes with captan or even application of captan in the wax without brushing caused substantial inking. Continued study is underway, as this study was conducted during a drought year. We may find that application close to harvest during a wet year or with overhead irrigation may contribute to inking.\n\nAnalysis of Long-term Pecan Tree Yields from Three Different Orchards Involving Numerous Varieties Using Mixed Model Analysis Techniques\n\nBenjamin G. Mullinix* and Patrick Conner, University of Georgia Tifton Campus, Tifton, GA 31793-0748\n\nRecords from pecan trees have been maintained from 1919 through the present from two orchards and for several years for a third orchard. Data for the different years pertaining to an individual tree is influenced by the effect of Year and by correlated responses from year to year. When considering multiple trees for the same variety spread over numerous varieties covering better than seventy years, the task of sorting out where the variation in responses lies becomes daunting. Using mixed model analysis provides an answer to some of these problems. A transformation that is useful is to find the cumulative yield over the years for each tree. The total yield for each tree can be divided into each year's cumulative value to arrive at a growth function which begins at zero and ends with 100%. Also, cumulative yield can be transformed using log10. The yearly estimate across trees is a mean percentage increase in total yield. The estimate for each variety is the mean yearly increase in yield. Instead of working with estimates of means, part of the analysis will be reported as components of variance. Only varieties will be reported as estimates of mean effects.\n\nThe Blueberry Orchard Bee\n\nBlair J. Sampson1,2, James H. Cane3, and Patricia R. Knight1, 1Mississippi State University, Coastal Research and Extension Center, 1815 Popps Ferry Road, Biloxi, MS 39532; 2USDA-ARS Thad Cochran Southern Horticultural Research Laboratory, 810 Hwy. 26 W., Poplarville, MS 39470; 3USDA-ARS Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory, Logan, UT 84322-5310\n\nBlueberry orchard bees prefer to forage at flowers identical to those of blueberries. There are other species of orchard bees and a few can be purchased as pollinators for apples, almonds, cherries, strawberries, and raspberries. However, these bees prefer other bloom sources to blueberry. Only the blueberry orchard bee has the instincts needed to be an effective and manageable blueberry pollinator. In fact, the bee does better feeding its offspring pollen and nectar from blueberry rather than from its own natural host plants (bearberries and barberries). Tests in Alabama and Mississippi show that females emerging as early as 1 Feb. and as late as 1 Apr. can pollinate blueberries cultivated from central Florida to North Carolina west to Louisiana and Texas. Each pollinating female visits as many as 10,000 blueberry flowers in her short 3-4 week lifespan and is responsible for setting about 12 kg of berries. Blueberries set by flowers pollinated by blue orchard bees are just as large and can be harvested as early as those resulting from pollination by southeastern blueberry bees, which are regarded as the most important native pollinators of southern blueberry crops. Orchard bees have the added advantage of being actively managed by blueberry growers. We discuss the history of our research program, bee propagation, and future efforts for commercially releasing the blueberry orchard bee.\n\nBlueberry Splitting Tendencies as Effected by Fruit Firmness\n\nDonna A. Marshall*, James M. Spiers, and Stephen J. Stringer, Thad Cochran Southern Horticultural Laboratory, Poplarville, MS\n\nUnderstanding the cause of fruit splitting in blueberries is difficult. Researchers have been working on the problem of fruit splitting in various fruit crops for more than 70 years. If a few key factors that cause splitting in blueberries can be identified and these factors can be evaluated in new potential cultivars, then long-term reductions in commercial blueberry fruit splitting are feasible. Blueberry breeders strive to develop a blueberry that is firm in texture. Yet, in previous studies splitting-susceptible fruit had higher fruit firmness values than splitting-resistant varieties. This study was initiated to further investigate the correlation between splitting susceptibility and fruit firmness. Rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei) and southern highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum X) blueberry cultivars and selections were used to determine if berries with higher measurements of fruit firmness had a higher splitting occurrence. Berries were measured for fruit firmness using a QTS25 and/or a FirmTech2 instrument. Fruit were submitted to laboratory-induced splitting. Correlations were determined by SAS. A significant negative correlation was found between splitting and deformation values tested on QTS25. No other significant correlation was found between splitting and firmness measurements.\n\nThe Influence of Nitrogen Rate on Pecan Kernel Necrosis, Leaf N Concentration, Yield, and Nut Quality\n\nMichael W. Smith*, Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078\n\nPecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) C. Koch] kernels (cotyledon) of ‘Pawnee’ displayed a consistent malady not described previously that was designated as “kernel necrosis.” The severest form of the problem was blackened, necrotic tissue engulfing the basal one-half to one-third of the kernel. The mildest form was darkened tissue in the dorsal grove at the basal end of the kernel. The problem was first observable during the gel stage of kernel development. No symptoms of kernel necrosis were visible on the shuck (involucre). Soil concentrations of nitrate were unusually high in the soil profile during January. Groundwater used for irrigation was contaminated with 34 mg·L−1 NO3-N. An experiment evaluated three nitrogen (N) rates, 0, 0.8 g·cm2 cross-sectional trunk area applied in March, and the producer's current N rate of 1.6 g + 1.6 g + 1.2 g·cm2 cross-sectional trunk area N applied during the second week in March, first week in June, and first week in September, respectively, on the incidence of kernel necrosis, leaf N concentration, soil NO3 concentration, yield, nut quality, and growth over five years. Nitrogen received in the irrigation water by all trees was 142, 191, 127, and 147 kg·ha−1 N in 2002 through 2005, respectively, as NO3 from the groundwater. Leaf N was affected by treatment only once during the study. Nitrates accumulated in the soil, increasing 24% in three years when no supplemental N was applied, except in the contaminated irrigation water. Kernel necrosis was either not affected by N treatment or during one year kernel necrosis was highest without supplemental N application. Tree yield, kernel quality, and growth were not affected by N treatment. Alternate bearing was apparent, suggesting that abundant N will not alleviate this problem. Kernel necrosis is a severe problem in this orchard, and has been identified in several orchards at low frequencies. The cause of kernel necrosis remains unknown.\n\nFloriculture, Ornamentals, and Turf Section\n\nAdopt-A-Tree: A Reforestation Program to Replace Lost Urban Canopy due to Disasters\n\nAdrian G.B. Hunsberger, University of Florida/IFAS Miami-Dade County Extension, 18710 SW 288th Street, Homestead, FL 33030\n\nMiami–Dade County Florida has an average tree canopy cover of less than 10%, compared to the national average of over 30%, with some areas having only 2% canopy cover. This low tree canopy coverage is due in part to losing one-half million backyard trees to the Citrus Canker Eradication Program. Countless additional trees have been lost from hurricanes and floods. To help replace lost tree canopy, Miami-Dade county applied and received a $6,000,000 grant which was used to create the “Adopt-A-Tree” Program. This allows Miami-Dade County homeowners to “adopt” two high quality locally grown trees per year. Tree adoption events are held throughout the county, with priority given to areas with the poorest tree canopy. University of Florida/IFAS Miami–Dade County Extension faculty provided input on program development and horticultural advice, conducted grades and standards workshops for nursery growers, developed bilingual (English and Spanish) educational materials, and staffed “adoption” events. As part of the “adoption” process, homeowners must attend an educational component before receiving trees. This includes a hands-on demonstration of correct planting procedures, which is important for our very shallow soils. Extension's educational materials are distributed to participants as part of the “adoption” process. During the past five years, over 120,000 people have been taught basic tree care; over 100,000 trees have been distributed at “adoption” events. Fruit trees are the most popular and non-flowering native trees the least popular. Program participants were surveyed 1 to 2 years post-adoption. An average of 79.2% trees survived, 96% of participants stated that the program met or exceeded their expectations, and 94% said that the educational materials were useful. In addition to the main goal of reforesting the county, this program has produced several additional effects: increased public awareness of the Extension as an educational resource, improved quality of nursery trees, and increased knowledge of proper tree care. The number of trees to be distributed will eventually total 184,000 and is by far the largest urban reforestation project of its kind in Florida.\n\nGrowth and Production of Ginger Lilies under a Sustainable Agroforestry System with Moringa in the U.S. Virgin Islands\n\nRamon A. Arancibia*1, Manuel Palada1, Mack Thetford2, and Shibu Jose2, 1University of the Virgin Islands–Agricultural Experiment Station, St Croix, VI 00850; 2University of Florida–West Florida Research and Education Center, Milton, FL 32583\n\nGrowth and production of ginger lilies (Alpinia purpurata) were evaluated in an alley cropping system with moringa (Moringa oleifera) in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ginger lilies were planted on 1 June 2005 as monoculture and in alleys (5 m wide) between rows of moringa trees (5 years old). The spacing was 0.9 m in row and 1.7 m between rows with two rows of ginger lilies in the alleys. Plot length was 10 m. Plots were divided in two subplots with and without fertilization (30 kg·ha-1 weekly of 20-20-20). In addition, moringa trees were partially pruned every 3 to 4 months and the biomass (foliage) was used as green manure for the alley crop. Nitrate concentration in the sheath sap was 448 and 150 ppm in the fertilized subplots and non-fertilized, respectively. In contrast, nitrate and potassium concentrations were the same in full sun and alley suggesting that moringa biomass was not sufficient to increase the nutrient status of the crop. Shade from moringa trees reduced solar radiation in the alley plots to 29% of that in full sun that resulted in reduced growth and number of floral spikes. Flowering started 6 and 10 months after planting in the monoculture and the alley, respectively, but harvest of commercial quality spikes was obtained after 13 months. In this first season of production (July to Dec. 2006), 31, 19, 10, and 3 flowers per plant were harvested in the fertilized monoculture, non-fertilized monoculture, fertilized alley, and non-fertilized alley, respectively. Production under a sustainable agroforestry system, although lower due to the shady conditions, is still a viable option to increase production and value of marginal forest areas.\n\nThe Impact of Foliage Container Garden Sales on Identifying Consumer Needs, Trends, and Preferences\n\nEmily Stefanski*1 and James L. Gibson2, 1Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of Florida, 1545 Fifield Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611; 2Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of Florida–Milton, 5988 Highway 90, Milton, FL 32583\n\nRetail garden center sales in Florida have increased from $5.1 billion in 2000 to $6.9 billion in 2005, with container garden sales being an economically important component of this trend. Florida is a state recognized for its wholesale production of foliage plants. In 2005, foliage plants represented $476 million of the total $976 million in total sales of floriculture crops. Identifying new marketing strategies and generating consumer data are important goals to improve foliage plant sales, therefore the objective of our study was to measure retail consumer preferences of foliage plant container gardens. In the fall of 2006 three types of foliage plant container gardens in green or terra cotta-colored, 25 × 25-cm pots displayed in three retail areas of a plant sale. Locations included the landing zone (before the entrance), transition zone (from entrance to inside), and the destination zone (within the retail setting). Consumer preferences and demographics were measured using a post-purchase survey. Results indicated more container gardens were purchased from middle-class females who were novice gardeners who frequently purchased plant material. More container gardens were purchased when displayed near the entrance. Container color had little impact on consumer preference, with more interest in high-quality foliage plant container gardens with unique color combinations.\n\nInfectivity of Mycorrhizal Products Marketed for Trees in Urban and Landscape Soils\n\nP. Eric Wiseman*1 and Christina E. Wells2, 1228 Cheatham Hall, Department of Forestry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061; 2151 Poole Agriculture Center, Department of Horticulture, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634\n\nCommercial products containing propagules of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widely marketed to improve woody plant performance on urban and landscape soils. The infectivity of commercial mycorrhizal inoculants has rarely been subjected to independent testing. Over a 3-year period, commercial mycorrhizal inoculants were evaluated in a series of greenhouse experiments using corn (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), trident maple (Acer buergerianum), and sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) as host plants. In corn and sorghum, colonization rarely exceeded 5% when plants were treated with anonymously purchased products. In contrast, a lab-cultured inoculant of similar composition yielded mean colonization of 38% to 61%. Despite the near absence of colonization, commercial AMF products generally improved shoot growth and increased soil concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in a dose-dependent manner. Commercial AMF products did not increase mycorrhizal colonization or shoot growth in magnolia or maple saplings. In a subsequent experiment, product-treated magnolia seedlings developed little or no mycorrhizal colonization, whereas plants treated with a lab-cultured inoculant were 74% colonized. If commercial AMF products are to receive broad acceptance as amendments for urban soils, manufacturers must better demonstrate that their products are compatible with current retail distribution methods and can promote mycorrhizal colonization under the conditions of their intended use.\n\nEffects of Vernalization and Photoperiod on Growth and Flowering of Three Coreopsis Cultivars\n\nJ. Raymond Kessler* and Gary J.Keever, 101 Funchess Hall, Department of Horticulture, Auburn University, AL 36849\n\nCoreopsis grandiflora ‘Early Sunrise’ and ‘Baby Sun’ and Coreopsis lanceolata ‘Sterntaler’ plants were treated with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks of vernalization (VER) at 4.4 °C and then placed in a greenhouse under either natural photoperiods (NAT) beginning in November or night-interrupted lighting (NIL) . ‘Baby Sun’ flowered 100% under NAT and NIL, indicating that VER was not required for flowering. NIL reduced DTF compared to NAT indicating that the response to photoperiod in this cultivar is quantitative. ‘Sterntaler’ flowered 100% after 4–8 weeks of VER; however, none of the plants flowered after 0–2 weeks of VER, indicating a qualitative requirement for at least 4 weeks of VER for flowering. NIL reduced DTF compared to NAT, indicating that the response to photoperiod in this cultivar is also quantitative. ‘Early Sunrise’ flowered 100% after 4–8 weeks of VER. None of the plants flowered after 0-2 weeks of VER, except those receiving 2 weeks VER under NIL that flowered 50%. Because 50% flowering would not be acceptable in practical application, the VER requirement for ‘Early Sunrise’ may be considered qualitative requiring at least 4 weeks of VER for flowering. NIL did reduce DTF compared to NAT. Therefore, the response to photoperiod in this cultivar is quantitative.\n\nBiology and Control of the Strawberry Rootworm in Container-grown Ornamental Crops\n\nCharles Hesselein*1 and David Boyd2, 1Mobile Ornamental Horticulture Research Center, PO Box 8276, Mobile, AL 36689-0276; 2USDA-ARS Southern Horticultural Laboratory, P.O. Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470\n\nSeveral systemic insecticides, Safari (12 and 24 oz), Celero (5.6 and 11.3 oz), Flagship (0.2 oz), Marathon II (21.8 fl oz), and Discus (120.3 and 167.7 fl oz), along with the non-systemic insecticide Talstar (10 and 40 fl oz) were applied as drenches to 1-gal potted ‘Pink Pear’ azalea plants for control of a leaf-feeding beetle, the strawberry rootworm (Paria fragariae). (Rates, in parentheses, are amount of product per 100 gal.) Multi-branched cuttings were removed from these plants in the field, beetles were placed on those cuttings and treatments were evaluated in the laboratory 8, 28, 56, 106, and 173 days after treatment (DAT). Treatments were evaluated both by counting living and dead beetles and a visual rating of damage caused by foliar feeding at least 6 days after exposing beetles to treated foliage. Eight DAT, only the 24-oz Safari and 11.3-oz Celero treatments had more dead beetles than the control (2 and 2.8 dead of three beetles respectively, 0.3 for the control). Twenty-eight DAT, the Safari, Celero, Marathon II, and Discus treatments had more dead beetles than the control (50%, 63%, 67%, 100%, 100%, and 100% of recovered beetles dead, respectively, 8% for the control). On this date, the 12-oz Safari treatment was less effective than the Marathon II and both Discus treatments. Only the 24-oz Safari treatment had more dead beetles than the control 173 DAT (38% of recovered beetles dead, 8% for the control). Differences were noted among treatments for damage rating on all dates. Eight and 28 DAT, treatments containing Safari, Celero, Marathon II, and Discus had lower ratings than the control. Treatments containing Safari, Marathon II, and Discus had lower foliar damage ratings than the control 56 DAT, with Marathon II and Discus having lower ratings than Safari. On 106 and 173 DAT, Marathon II had lower foliar damage ratings than the control. It appears that the dose response for feeding cessation (i.e., damage) may be lower than that required to kill beetles. Due to the expense of drench-applied treatments, it is likely that only Marathon II, Discus, and possibly Safari drenches are practical for growers to use for control of the strawberry rootworm. More work needs to be done to determine the efficacy of spray treatments and the effect of drench treatments on media dwelling larvae.\n\nIrradiation of Lagerstroemia to Induce Sterility\n\nDavid Knauft* and Michael Dirr, Horticulture Department, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602-7273\n\nHalf-sib seed populations from two Lagerstroemia cultivars released by the University of Georgia breeding program, ‘Cherry Dazzle’ and ‘White Chocolate,’ and from one breeding line designated DWF 07-00 were treated with gamma radiation at 0, 15, 20, 30, and 40 kr. The treatments were imposed to induce sterility, with the goal of eliminating unattractive seed capsules from the plant, potentially increasing flowering duration, and providing an example of proactive research designed to address invasiveness in horticultural plants. Seed treated with the 30 and 40 kr dosages germinated but failed to survive past the cotyledonary leaf stage. The 15 kr dosage provided the largest number of viable seed in all three populations. At least 55% of the plants from all treatment combinations produced flowers the first year from seed. In one population of DWF 07-00 30% of the plants from 15 and 20 kr irradiation produced flowering plants without seed the first year of the study. In the second year, however, 85% of those plants produced at least some seed, suggesting physiological immaturity the first year from seed. Correlation of days to first flower between the first and second years were nonsignificant. None of the sterile plants have sufficient horticultural merit to be considered for cultivar release. While most of the sterile or low seed-set plants did not exhibit long flowering duration, several selections produced flowers for more than 150 days and are being used in breeding efforts.\n\nField Evaluation of Palms in Hardiness Zones 7b and 6b\n\nGary L. Wade, Department of Horticulture, 221 Hoke Smith Building, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602-7273\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate selected palm species for their hardiness and adaptability to hardiness zones 7b and 6b. A replicated field planting of eight palms was established at a Watkinsville, Ga., research station, hardiness zone 7b, on 29 Apr. 2004. Palms planted were needle palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), Birmingham sabal (Sabal ‘Birmingham’), Brazoria palm (Sabal ×texensis), Louisiana dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor ‘Louisiana’), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), Kumaon palm (Trachycarpus takil), and windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei). On 23 June 2005, a replicated field planting of seven palms was established at research in Blairsville, Ga., hardiness zone 6b. Palms planted at this location were needle palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrx), Bulgarian windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) (seed collected in Bulgaria), Taylor form windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) (seed collected from palms in Raleigh, N.C.), McCurtain County dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor (seed collected from palms in McCurtain Co., Okla.), Louisiana dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor ‘Louisiana’), Birmingham sabal (Sabal ‘Birmingham’), and Brazoria palm (Sabal ×texensis). Growth measurements and cold damage assessment will be done over a 5-year period. The palms in the Blairsville study were provided cold protection their first year by enclosing them in wire hoops filled one-third full with dry pine straw and covered with 3-mil white plastic. No cold protection was provided to the Wakinsville palms. At the Watkinsville location, two Sabal palmettos and one Sabal minor ‘Louisiana’ died during the first winter. No additional palms have been lost since the first winter, and all remaining palms, with the exception of Rhapidophyllum hystrix, have shown significant growth increases over 2 years. At the Blairsville site, Sabal minor ‘Louisiana’ showed the greatest growth increase the first year (62%), Raphidophyllum hystrix showed no growth increase the first year, while the other palms grew an average of 20% during the first year. None of the palms in the Blairsville study died during the first winter. However, some of the species at that location have shown significant frond damage after several nights of single-digit temperatures during the winter of 2006–2007.\n\nFinal Summary of All-America Daylily Evaluations: Rust Observations, Flowering, and Landscape Performance\n\nAllen D. Owings*1, Gordon E. Holcomb2, C. Allen Broyles3, Ann L. Gray1, and Edward W. Bush1, 1128 J. C. Miller Hall, Department of Horticulture, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803; 2444 Life Sciences Building, Department of Plant Pathology and Crop Physiology, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803; 34560 Essen Lane, Burden Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70809\n\nAll-America daylily cultivars have been evaluated in LSU AgCenter landscape trials from 2003–2006 to determine susceptibility to daylily rust (Puccinia hemerocallidis), flowering performance and overall visual quality. Individual plants of ‘Bitsy’, ‘Starstruck’, ‘Black Eyed Stella’, ‘Lullaby Baby’, ‘Judith’, ‘Bitsy’, ‘Leebea Orange Crush’, ‘Frankly Scarlet’, ‘Plum Perfect’, ‘Chorus Line’, ‘Lady Lucille’, ‘Miss Mary Mary’, and ‘Red Volunteer’ were placed in full sun rows of Olivier silt loam soil. Plants were ranged in a replicated completely randomized design and mulched with pine straw mulch twice annually. Plants were drip irrigated as needed to prevent stress. Slow-release fertilizer was applied twice annually—once in the spring at 1 lb N/1000 sq ft and once in the summer at half the spring rate. Fungicides were not applied during the study. Plants were rated for daylily rust presence annually in September and November. Plants were rated weekly from March through October annually for flower and bud presence. Resistant cultivars were ‘Miss Mary Mary’, ‘Chorus Line’, ‘Lullaby Baby’, and ‘Bitsy’. Slightly susceptible cultivars were ‘Black Eyed Stella’ and ‘Frankly Scarlet’. ‘Plum Perfect’ was moderately susceptible. Highly susceptible cultivars were ‘Red Volunteer’, ‘Lady Lucille’, ‘Starstruck’, ‘Leebea Orange Crush’, and ‘Judith’. Cultivars in bloom the most days were ‘Miss Mary Mary’, ‘Lady Lucille’, ‘Bitsy’, and ‘Black Eyed Stella’. The earliest to bloom cultivars were ‘Bitsy’, ‘Black Eyed Stella’, ‘Judith and ‘Miss Mary Mary’. Repeat bloomers were ‘Lady Lucille’, ‘Bitsy’, and ‘Black Eyed Stella’.\n\nInitial Landscape Shrub Rose Observations: ‘Knock Out’, ‘Home Run’, ‘Wild Thing’, and ‘Nearly Wild’\n\nAllen D. Owings*1, C. Allen Broyles2, and Ann L. Gray1, 1128 J. C. Miller Hall, Department of Horticulture, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803; 24560 Essen Lane, Burden Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70809\n\nA landscape evaluation of shrub rose cultivars was conducted at Burden Center in Baton Rouge, LA, in 2006. Rose cultivars compared for overall performance and blackspot susceptibility were ‘Knock Out’ (Conard-Pyle, 2000), ‘Home Run’ (Weeks, 2006), and ‘Nearly Wild’ (Jackson and Perkins, 2007). A control cultivar, ‘Nearly Wild’, was included for comparison. No. 1 grade bushes were planted on 4-ft centers in April in raised 48-inch rows composed of Olivier silt loam soil. The planting location was full sun. Drip irrigation was provided as needed to prevent stress. Pine straw mulch was added at planting. Slow-release fertilizer was applied at the rate of 1.5 lbs N/1000 sq ft in April and at 1 lb N/1000 sq ft in July. Fungicide was not applied and pruning was not conducted. Visual quality ratings based on a scale from 1 to 5 were taken twice monthly June through October. Blackspot disease ratings were taken in August and October. Blackspot was not observed on ‘Knock Out’ or ‘Home Run’. Minor blackspot was noted on ‘Nearly Wild’ and ‘Wild Thing’ with ‘Nearly Wild’ having approximately 20% of foliage with blackspot and ‘Wild Thing’ having approximately 10% of foliage with blackspot by October. Visual quality was highest for ‘Knock Out’. ‘Home Run’ had quality ratings slightly less than ‘Knock Out’ but greater than the other two cultivars. In some months, ‘Home Run’ and ‘Knock Out’ were not significantly different in terms of plant quality. ‘Nearly Wild’ and ‘Wild Thing’ had the lowest visual quality ratings over the evaluation period.\n\nPostharvest/Plant Biotechnology Section—Breeding vs. Molecular Approaches\n\nImproving Shelf Life of Blackberries through Conventional Breeding\n\nJohn R.

Moore envisioned vast improvement of this “native” southern U.S. crop through crossing and selection of existing germplasm. He used the recurrent mass selection system of breeding, a system that utilizes the crossing of complementary parents that show positive phenotypic traits, and selecting the superior progeny at fruiting. Great advances were made, and by 1983 four cultivars had been released that were superior to previous developments. The release of ‘Navaho’ in 1989 was a hallmark achievement in that it had erect, thornless canes, the first cultivar to exhibit this combination of traits. ‘Navaho’ was also identified to have much better shelf life than thorny cultivars, and in the early 1990s the interest for a cultivar that had shelf life for more than 1 to 3 days was developing, as pre-picked sales (rather than pick-your-own) were becoming more common. This led to the development of a cooperative research endeavor between the University of Arkansas (John R. Clark) and USDA-ARS (Penelope Perkins-Veazie) to expand postharvest evaluations of blackberries. Early progress indicated that: 1) ‘Navaho’ could be stored for up to 2 weeks in appropriate conditions; 2) firmness in field evaluations did not always translate to good shelf life; 3) substantial variability for shelf life was present in the Arkansas breeding germplasm; and 4) a protocol for routine evaluations could be developed to screen a wide range of genotypes, including evaluations for berry firmness, leakiness, development of mold, and retention of black drupelet color. This effort has led to expanded recommendations of commercial potential of newer cultivars such as ‘Apache’ and ‘Ouachita’ for the shipping market. Identification of superior parents for shelf life potential has led to hybridizations for improved shelf life to be undertaken with substantial further phenotypic advances identified. The relationship of breeder and postharvest physiologist in this effort has allowed substantial advances in technology for producers, resulting in major expansions of blackberry production in the South, other regions of the United States, and other countries.\n\nCarotenoid Analysis using the Puree Absorbance Method for Germplasm Screening\n\nAngela R.

This is the case with quantifying carotenoids in fresh fruits and vegetables. Carotenoid content can vary significantly between varieties; therefore a method to rapidly screen germplasm for high carotenoid levels is desirable. Many laboratories have attempted to develop reflectance colorimetric methods to determine carotenoid content with varying degrees of success. Attempts to use reflective colorimetric values to estimate lycopene content in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai) have not been successful. To avoid the inherent problems with reflective color readings on the surface of cut watermelon, our group has successfully utilized a xenon flash spectrophotometer to measure absorbance of opaque purees of watermelon flesh. This absorbance can then be used to estimate total lycopene content in red fruit and total carotenoid content in canary yellow-fleshed watermelons. We have shown that our puree absorbance method also works well for estimating lycopene in fresh tomato purees and many processed tomato products. Preliminary results suggest that this method will also work for beta-carotene in cantaloupe and prolycopene in orange watermelon. The R2 values using this method compare well with other published methods, with ranges between 0.88 and 0.99 depending on the type of fruit and carotenoid being evaluated. The puree absorbance method is fast, accurate, requires no hazardous solvents, and yields values"
