The made-for-TV rock band hit the air and the pop-charts in the mid-60s.\n\nDavey Jones, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and, of course, Michael Nesmith. After they broke up in 1970, Nesmith recorded a string of solo albums and last month, kicked off his first solo tour in nearly 21 years.\n\nGuest\n\nGeoff Edgers, Boston Globe Arts Reporter (@geoffedgers)\n\nSee\n\nMichael Nesmith at the Somerville Theatre on Saturday, April 13th\n\nRead\n\nWired: \"The news media, it's true, sticks to Nesmith's Monkee-ness like gum on a go-go boot. Never mind that Nez helped invent MTV and country rock, that he published a novel and pioneered a home-video distribution business, and that he cut 13 post-Monkees albums and produced cult film classics like Repo Man. And never mind that Nesmith - who could choose to be as ostentatious and narcissistic as the next gazillionaire rock star - instead carries on the philanthropic traditions of his mother, Bette Graham, the inventor of Liquid Paper typing-correction fluid.\""
