        "text": "Course Guide: Sedgefield is an original Donald Ross design which has typical Carolina course overtures. A short Par 70 by modern standards, the course still favours accuracy from the tee over outright power. Ultimately streaky scorers have got the job done here, with scoring being dictated solely by the firmness of the greens when wind isn’t a factor.\n\nChampion Bermudagrass greens were laid for the 2012 renewal and they undoubtedly run faster than the tired Bentgrass putting surfaces they replaced, particularly if conditions remain dry. But as the greens have settled scoring continues to improve with -21/258, -22/258, -21/259, -22/258, -21/259, -20/260 and -20/260 being 7 of the last 8 winning totals.\n\nSedgefield Country Club, Greensboro, North Carolina: Designer: Donald Ross 1926, with Kris Spence renovation 2007; Course Type: Carolina, Mid-score, Short Length; Par: 70; Length: 7,131 yards; Number of Holes with Water In-Play: 6; Number of Sand Bunkers: 52; Acres of Fairway: 25; Fairways: Bermudagrass; Rough: Bermudagrass 2.5″; Greens: 6,000 sq.ft average featuring Champion Bermudagrass; Stimpmeter: 12.5ft.\n\nCourse Scoring Average & PGA Tour Difficulty Rank:\n\n2023: 69.47 (-0.53), Rank 22 of 50 courses\n\n2022: 69.26 (-0.74), Rank 27 of 50 courses\n\n2021: 68.88 (-1.12), Rank 34 of 51 courses\n\n2020: 68.78 (-1.22), Rank 29 of 41 courses\n\n2019: 68.18 (-1.82), Rank 41 of 49 courses\n\nFairway Widths (yards): Below are the fairway widths for Sedgefield Country Club and how they compare to recent courses that we’ve seen on Tour:\n\nSedgefield: 250 yards from tee: 29 yards wide; 275:28; 300:26 325:23; 350:22.\n\nTPC Twin Cities: 250 yards from the tee: 38 yards wide; 275:38; 300:31; 325:30; 350:36.\n\nTPC Deere Run: 250 yards from tee: 41 yards wide; 275:40; 300:36 325:33; 350:30.\n\nDetroit Golf Club: 250 yards from tee: 34 yards wide; 275:34; 300:35 325:34; 350:33.\n\nTPC River Highlands: 250 yards from the tee: 38 yards wide; 275:36; 300:29; 325:29; 350:28.\n\nPinehurst Number 2: Average 35-45 yards wide.\n\nMuirfield Village: 250 yards from the tee: 34 yards wide; 275:32; 300:28; 325:24; 350:27.\n\nHamilton G&CC: 250 yards from the tee: 29 yards wide; 275:29; 300:29; 325:27; 350:28.\n\nColonial: Average 25-30 yards wide.\n\nQuail Hollow: 250 yards from tee: 33 yards wide; 275:32; 300:31; 325:30; 350:29.\n\nHarbour Town: 250 yards from tee: 29 yards wide; 275:26; 300:22; 325:26; 350:22.\n\nOaks Course: 250 yards from tee: 33 yards wide; 275:34; 300:29; 325:27; 350:26.\n\nMemorial Park: 30–40 yards at 300 yards.\n\nCopperhead: 250 yards from the tee: 24 yards wide; 275:20; 300:21; 325:23 350:19.\n\nTPC Sawgrass: 250 yards from the tee: 31 yards wide; 275:32; 300:30; 325:28 350:20.\n\nBay Hill: 250 yards from the tee: 32 yards wide; 275:33; 300:33; 325:39 350:29.\n\nPGA National: 250 yards from the tee: 29 yards wide; 275:27; 300:25; 325:27 350:25.\n\nRiviera: 250 yards from the tee: 33 yards wide; 275:27; 300:26; 325:26 350:28.\n\nTPC Scottsdale: 250 yards from the tee: 33 yards wide; 275:30; 300:28; 325:27; 350:27.\n\nPebble Beach: 250 yards from the tee: 33 yards wide; 275:33; 300:29; 325:30 350:26.\n\nTorrey Pines South: 250 yards from the tee: 26 yards wide; 275:27; 300:25; 325:24; 350:23.\n\nPete Dye Stadium: 250 yards from the tee: 29 yards wide; 275:27; 300:26; 325:26; 350:24.\n\nWaialae: 250 yards from the tee: 34 yards wide; 275:32; 300:34; 325:37; 350:34.\n\nPlantation Course: 250 yards from the tee: 59 yards wide; 275:61; 300:65; 325:60; 350:62.\n\nCourse Designer Links: For research purposes other Donald Ross designs include:\n\nAronimink – 2010/11 AT&T National & 2018 BMW Championship\n\nDetroit Golf Club – Rocket Mortgage Classic\n\nEast Course at Oak Hill – 2013 + 2023 PGA Championship\n\nEast Lake Country Club – Tour Championship\n\nPinehurst Number 2 – 2014 & 2024 U.S. Open\n\nPlainfield – 2011 & 2015 Barclays\n\nCourse Overview: Sedgefield CC is perennially one the two easiest Par-70s on the PGA Tour alongside Waialae CC (Sony Open). Take 2023 with 20 players finishing double-digits under par. Set to the south-east of Greensboro, the course has a typical Carolina feel with tree-lined fairways, pine straw and Bermudagrass throughout. Fairways are quite tight but relatively easy to find if conditions are soft.\n\nStatistically driving accuracy often helps (yes you read that right), but the key to the course, which measures just over 7,200 yards, are Ross’s green complexes which although undulating and surrounded by shaved run-off areas are actually large for the length of the course.\n\nIf the Champion Bermudagrass greens are receptive (as they were for Rounds 1 and 2 in 2023) that’s the green light for low scoring. Winners here year-in, year-out, must hit a minimum 14 greens per round and invariably break par every 1 in 3 holes. A fast start, excellent and consistent approach play, and a hot putter are they keys to victory, plus it’s noteworthy that the front 9 plays far easier and has to be capitalised upon.\n\nWyndham Championship Winners: 2023: Lucas Glover (-20); 2022: Tom Kim (-20); 2021: Kevin Kisner (-15); 2020: Jim Herman (-21); 2019: J.T.

High of 88.

All in all I’d downgrade winning to around mid-teens.\n\nPlayer Strokes Gained Rankings: These top 25 in the field rankings are based on an 8-tournament window that stretches back to the U.S. Open which includes both PGA Tour and DP World Tour events, where recorded.

I didn’t read them great yesterday. I think a lot of us that have played here a lot are so used to the greens being so, so fast and then with the weather we’ve had, they’re not that. So there’s a lot of different speeds, different reads that it’s hard to get out of your head when you’re used to them being so fast.\n\nI grew up on putting a lot of Bermuda greens, I seem to read the greens pretty well. I think I’m OK laying back off the tees a lot to make sure I’m in the fairway. When my irons are sharp, I seem to be able to make a lot of birdies. I think you try to attack this place a little too aggressive and miss some fairways, it can bite you. I learned that quite a while ago. I think it’s just a “fairways first” mentality, and then if you get some good numbers and hit it close, you’ve got a good chance to make some birdies.”\n\nTom Kim (2022): “Yeah, I mean, I just, I didn’t really feel uncomfortable. Normally it’s all kind of a mental thing, I feel like. Just you want to start good and a start like (A quadruple bogey on the 1st hole) that wasn’t the best, but I told myself, hey, imagine if you make two more bogeys a day, it’s just one hole, so just keep pushing. There’s definitely a lot of opportunities out there. You know, I got a good birdie on 3 to just kind of get my momentum and had a really good up-and-down on the par 5. Just kind of kept pushing. Felt like after the first hole I kind of played really solid.”\n\n“I feel like I take it one day at a time. Just because I’ve been playing well, I played well last week, this could be a really different week. I told myself it’s a fresh start. This is my fifth, sixth week in a row, I played a lot of golf coming from Scotland as well, but I feel ready and I’m happy to be out here.”\n\nKevin Kisner (2021): “My record’s pretty good here at Sedgefield and I enjoy where everybody– we’ve got to put the ball in the same place. And then I love the greens surfaces, obviously what I grew up on. There’s less of those courses on Tour than ever, so when we get to weeks like this, I really have to be on form to play well and these are my chances to hold the trophies.”\n\nJim Herman (2020): “ Yeah, 61, it’s great anytime you can do that. Just gave myself good looks. You’ve got to be below the hole, got to have makeable putts out here or you’re going to be playing defensive. If you’re above the hole, you’re going to be just lagging all day long. I had a really good approach game today, I think I hit almost every green. The one green I did miss, I putted in from off the green. Yeah, good iron play. Starts off the tee with me, got to hit it in the fairway. I’m not as long as most guys out here, so I’ve got to put it in play, give myself a chance from the fairway.”\n\nJ.T. Poston (2019): “ Ball-striking’s been really good, haven’t missed many greens. Just keep giving myself a lot of looks and hit a lot of good putts. Made a few, but just really steady, solid golf for the most part. The golf course was easy enough to where if you hit fairways, you could attack some pins, and my iron play was really solid all week. So it was nice to give myself some looks, and today I finally made some putts and was able to get that low one in there.”\n\nBrandt Snedeker (2018): “Yeah, I’m playing a lot better than I have been early in the year. I’m excited about the way I’m rolling the ball, putting great again. For whatever reason, seems like every week I have a bad round or a bad nine holes that kind of keeps me out of contention. So a big focus this week is staying patient. This is a golf course I had a lot of success on, I love it. It breeds kind of my kind of play hit, hit fairways, hit some greets, lots of wedge opportunities. It’s going to turn into a birdie-fest like it always does because the course is in great, shape so you know what you have to do when you step up on the first tee, put the ball in play and give yourself a lot of opportunities. So excited about that and excited about seeing how my game’s feeling. After last week at the PGA I kind of found something I thought on the weekend and hopefully it kind of stays in there and gives me a good chance to win this week.”\n\nHenrik Stenson: “I think whenever you play a week after a Major championship, which isn’t all the time for me I found in the past you can find the golf courses quite easy when you play the tougher course the week before and you still kind of keep a strong mindset in terms of one shot at a time which, again, you always want to have but probably even more so at the Majors. It’s crucial. I’ve had some good success in particular playing in Germany the week after the U.S. Open a lot of times and done well.\n\nHave left the driver out this week. Strong 3-wood, 4-wood and 2-iron. Putting myself in position and trying to stay out of that Bermuda rough. If you do that you got pretty short clubs and you can be accurate with your second shots. Plenty more of the same tomorrow. I’m trying to be kind of offensive to defensive spots, if you know, off the tee on a few of holes but then you get a lot of 8, 9 irons, wedges into these greens and they’re pretty receptive. You can be pretty aggressive if you’re feeling you got good numbers and feels right, go for it. We’ll produce a lot of birdie chances the first two days. My putting has been excellent. I’ve seen the lines nicely. Hit a lot of good putts and I’ve been hitting a lot of good iron shots as well, some wedges and some mid to short irons, and that’s kind of what I keep on doing and trying to hit a lot of fairways with the 3-wood and trying to attacking the hole and that’s been working nicely so far. No need to change that for tomorrow.”\n\nLuke Donald: “It’s a course I really enjoy. I love the design of this course. The greens are very true, very fast, quite undulating. You have to have some imagination. And nice to get off to a solid start. Conditions were nice out there. The greens are holding for the most part and not too much wind. So, you’re playing well there’s some opportunities out there. I struggled a little bit visualizing that tee shot. It was a couple tee shots you don’t see them land and 18 is one of them. I hit a poor tee shot left and had to chip out. I had a good number with a little wedge, stick it to that pin. Would have been disappointing to drop one there after playing so well for the rest of the round.”\n\nWebb Simpson: “It goes back to the point of the golf course. Bay Hill, Tiger won so many times. Akron produces long hitters winning there. Depending on the golf course you kind of create your own pool of winners that are usually going to win there, whereas this course, like I said, it favours nobody. So I think that’s what makes it hard to repeat, that if you have a field of whatever, what did we have, 156 players, that most everybody in the field has a legitimate chance to win whereas, you know, maybe you go to San Diego, I can’t remember the last time somebody who didn’t bomb it winning there. That’s a place where you take out 50 percent of the field from the start of the week. like I said earlier about the golf course, I don’t think it’s one where you have to play many years to learn it, where a lot of courses you do. Like Augusta is a good example whereas this golf course is more straight in front of you and, again, it’s a level playing field for everyone which I wish we played more like these.”\n\nTiger Woods: “The golf course is tricky. I know it’s wet and the fairways, ball in hand but the greens are so fast. They’re so speedy. Hideki, myself, even Brooks, we ripped a couple putts down there probably 10, 15 feet past the hole and even though as wet as they are, they’re still that fast downhill, down-grain and got to respect it and it puts such a premium on iron play to put the ball in the right spot and give yourself putts. For the majority of the day I was putting myself in perfect spots where I can be aggressive.”\n\nIncoming Form of Wyndham Championship since 2012:\n\nLucas Glover: MC 3M Open/ 5th Barbasol/ 6th JDC/4th Rocket.\n\nTom Kim: 9th Rocket/26th 3M Open/47th Open/3rd Scottish Open.\n\nKevin Kisner: 63rd WGC St Jude/73rd Open/8th Rocket/5th Travelers.\n\nJim Herman: 77th PGA/MC Memorial/MC Workday Open/33rd RBC Heritage.\n\nJ.T.

Pan, J.T. Poston, Seamus Power, Davis Riley, J.J. Spaun, Kevin Streelman, Adam Svensson, Brendon Todd, Jhonattan Vegas, Gary Woodland, Will Zalatoris.\n\nRecent winning totals of -20, -20, -15, -21, -22, -21, -22, -21, -17, -17, -14 and -18 highlight that the key to success in Greensboro is two-fold: make plenty of eagles and birdies plus minimise dropped shots. It’s also worth noting that we’re returning to a Champion Bermudagrass-greened golf course this week – naturally many have played months of Bentgrass, Fescue and Poa Annua grasses. Indeed this is the first Bermudagrass greened tournament since the U.S. Open in mid-June.\n\nAcross the recent PGA Tour schedule the only courses where Champion Bermudagrass greens feature are Congaree (2021 Palmetto Championship & 2022 CJ Cup), the Country Club of Jackson, The Dunes Golf and Beach Club (2024 Myrtle Beach Classic), TPC Southwind and Quail Hollow (since the 2017 PGA Championship), plus Pinehurst Number 2 which hosted this year’s U.S. Open also featured Champion.\n\nIt won’t surprise in a tournament where 4 straight rounds of 65/66 is the target that streaky scorers dominate the contending positions. However game-wise since the swap to Champion Bermudagrass greens it’s safe to say that Garcia, Reed, Villegas, Love III, Si Woo Kim, Henrik Stenson, Brandt Snedeker, J.T. Poston, Jim Herman, Kevin Kisner, Tom Kim and Lucas Glover all primarily won through their ability to create enough birdie opportunities with neat tee-to-green play which they then converted.\n\nThose looking for Donald Ross-positive players should look no further than PGA Tour tracks Aronimink (AT&T National 2009/10 + 2018 BMW Championship), Detroit Golf Club (Rocket Mortgage Classic), East Lake (Tour Championship) as well as Oak Hill (2013 +2023 PGA Championship) and Pinehurst No2 (2014 + 2024 U.S. Open).\n\nSedgefield has a habit of producing 1st time PGA Tour winners with Tom Kim, J.T. Poston, Si Woo Kim, Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Arjun Atwal and Ryan Moore all recording their first main-Tour victories here since 2008. FedEx Cup standings-wise, Webb Simpson was 12th in the standings when he captured his first title here at 20/1 in 2011. Since then 102nd, 78th, 105th, 187th, 44th, 75th, 80th, 83rd, 192nd, 69th, Special Temporary Member (Tom Kim could only qualify for the FedEx Cup Playoffs by winning the Wyndham) and 112th suggest that we should certainly consider players a little deeper than the very obvious candidates this week."
