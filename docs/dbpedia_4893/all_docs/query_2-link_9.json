        "text": "WANT to get to Glastonbury from Hartford? Just take the Whitehead-Conland Highway south to the Christopher Columbus Highway, crossing the Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge Bridge in Wethersfield. Exit at 25N. Go east, crossing over the Justin A. DeNino and the William Putnam bridges before turning south onto the Veterans of Foreign Wars Highway. If you take Exit 8 and go into the eastern portion of Glastonbury, you will be traveling the 94th Infantry Division Memorial Highway as far as the Hebron line.\n\nOr, you can swing onto Route 17 from the VFW Highway, continuing into South Glastonbury where you will cross over Roaring Brook on the Alexander L. Bocciarelli Bridge.\n\nThe confused can just go by the map: Take Route 91 south to Route 3 east to Route 2 south to Glastonbury. Continue on Route 17 to South Glastonbury.\n\nHighways and bridges in Connecticut have been sprouting names for a while, as the Legislature decides to honor an individual or group, but this year has been like no other. Thirty roads and bridges have been named, a record for a single year, almost twice as many as last year.\n\nThe new honors included bridges named for two men lost in the World Trade Center attack, two sections of highway named for state troopers killed in the line of duty decades ago, and a section of road named for an early explorer.\n\nBut people driving over the bridges or along the roads see the commemorative signs the Department of Transportation puts up and often wonder who these people are or why they are being honored. Christopher Columbus (Route 91 in Cromwell) is obvious, as is Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge (a bridge in Wethersfield on Route 91) But Ernest J. Morse (Route 108 in Trumbull) and Thomas DeAngelis (a bridge on Route 173 in West Hartford)?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
