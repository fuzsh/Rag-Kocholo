        "text": "Kilpatrick cleared to face Roscommon in SFC tie\n\nPublished\n\n21 June 2024\n\nTyrone midfielder Conn Kilpatrick has had his proposed two-game ban set aside and is now available for selection for Saturday's All-Ireland Preliminary quarter-final against Roscommon at Healy Park.\n\nKilpatrick was cleared at a meeting of the GAA's Central Appeals Committee (CAC) on Friday night.\n\nIf the ban had been enacted, Kilpatrick would also have missed a potential quarter-final next week if the Red Hands progress.\n\nThe Tyrone player received a straight red card during last weekend's round-robin group fixture against Cork at Tullamore.\n\nHe was sent off after an off-the-ball altercation was flagged by a linesman.\n\nHis potential suspension had been doubled from one game to two because it was his second straight red of the year - the player having also been dismissed during his side's Allianz Football League win over Roscommon.\n\nThe proposed ban was upheld by the Central Hearings Committee during the week but the CAC has now ruled that the influential Kilpatrick should be free to face the Rossies."
