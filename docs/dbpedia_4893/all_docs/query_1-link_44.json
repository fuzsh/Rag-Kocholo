What the hell were you doing back here?\"\n\n— Mark McCluskey to Michael\n\nCaptain Mark McCluskey was a corrupt Irish-French police captain in the service of the Tattaglia Family and Virgil Sollozzo in The Godfather Game.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMark McCluskey's father was also a police captain who took his son on visits around the station, where he would be given gifts of cash by the cops, who were under his father's protection and also worked for him. It was then that his son decided to follow in his father's footsteps.\n\nMcCluskey served 20 years on the force. At first, he was an honest and good cop. However, while he was still a patrolman, he became easily susceptible to bribes in order to supplement his salary, particularly once he needed to support his three sons. Even when he rose to captain, he only took home €110 a week. He was also good friends with Bruno Tattaglia, who had gone to the Forman School with one of McCluskey's three sons in Connecticut in America. McCluskey would clear the records of Bruno's employees in return for large cash rewards, and free trips to Bruno's stripclub, The Luna Bar. This friendship led to McCluskey meeting Virgil Sollozzo. Under the pretext of cultivating Sollozzo as an informer, he agreed to become the drug dealer's bodyguard, the money paying for the funeral of his sister-in-law back in Ireland.\n\nMcCluskey and Sollozzo[]\n\nMcCluskey assisted Sollozzo by removing the guards from Vito Corleone's hospital room in Little Town and throwing them out, so that Sollozzo and his men would have a clear shot on the Don. However, the Don's youngest son, Michael happened to visit that evening and noticed the lack of guards. Michael called his brother Sonny about the problem and moved Vito to a different hospital room.\n\nDeath[]\n\nOne evening in the car on the way to Luis' Restaurant for a meeting with Sollozzo, McCluskey apologised Michael for his crankiness the other night at the hospital.\n\nMichael asked \"Can I go?\" before going to the bathroom, which angered Sollozzo, but McCluskey just cleaned the toilet, \"So, watch where you pee, Michael.\" However, one of Pete Clemenza's men planted a gun behind a toilet in the bathroom. Michael got it, and returned as if nothing happened. He then stood up and shot Sollozzo twice in the head, then shot McCluskey once in the neck and once in the head. Sollozzo died instantly, McCluskey pitched forward onto the table, breaking it in half. While Sollozzo died on his seat, McCluskey died on the ground.\n\nIn the game[]\n\nMcCluskey's first name was first mentioned in game and not at all in the film. In the game he has the same original lines as he did in movie and also the same role."
