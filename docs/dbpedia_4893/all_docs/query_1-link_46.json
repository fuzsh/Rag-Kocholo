        "text": "Deirdre M. Daly, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced that CHAD McCLUSKEY, 44, of San Clemente, Calif., was sentenced today by Senior U.S. District Judge Alfred V. Covello in Hartford to 65 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, for his role in a meth distribution ring.\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, this matter stems from a joint investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Connecticut State Police’s Statewide Narcotics Task Force. The investigation, which included the use of court-authorized wiretaps, controlled purchases of meth, physical surveillance and the use of an undercover officer, revealed that McCLUSKEY and his girlfriend, Kristen Laschober, sent shipments of meth to Kevin Wallin of Waterbury over the course of approximately four years. After receiving the shipments of meth, Wallin distributed the drug to other dealers and sold it to his own customers. Some of the shipments were sent on consignment with the understanding that Wallin would pay McCLUSKEY and Laschober with proceeds generated from his distribution of the drug.\n\nFor a time during the conspiracy, McCLUSKEY and Laschober supplied Wallin with between one and three pounds of meth on a monthly basis.\n\nMcCLUSKEY and Laschober were arrested in Las Vegas, Nev., on January 10, 2013. On April 18, 2013, they each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing methamphetamine (“meth”).\n\nWallin was arrested on January 3, 2013. On April 2, 2013, he pleaded guilty to the same charge.\n\nLaschober and Wallin await sentencing.\n\nThis matter is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick Caruso and H. Gordon Hall.\n\nPUBLIC AFFAIRS CONTACT:"
