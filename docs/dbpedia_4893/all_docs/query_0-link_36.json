Two distinct haplogroups are evolving from the McCloskey DNA Project: E-m35/E-v13 and M222:\n\nE-m35 is one of four primary DNA haplogroups considered to be the “founding lineages for the Jewish people (www.jewishgen.org)”[1]. In an article about Jewish ancestry of Lowland Scots and Northern Irish, the name McCloskey is specifically named on page 30.[2][3]\n\n[1] Hirschman, Elizabeth C.
