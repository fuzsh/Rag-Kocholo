Given the impeccable care I have received from these specialists, I feel more like a member of their extended family rather than a patient.”\n\nKristi\n\nPatient since 2016\n\n“I have always received thoughtful, reassuring and thorough care... My appointments are never rushed and my questions are always answered. As an older woman, this is important to me. I recommend this practice without hesitation.”\n\nAnonymous\n\nPatient since 2017\n\n“Who looks forward to a doctor visit? I do! This practice builds relationships with their patients by demonstrating patience, warmth, and professionalism. Each doctor is productive and compassionate and the office staff is helpful and personable, while creating a comfortable space. I have been a patient since I was 16 and they delivered both of my babies; for all 33 years, they have been incredible. This educator gives Sound ObGyn a solid A+.”\n\nIngrid\n\nPatient since 1987\n\n“I have been a patient here since age 18 and I am now 44. I work in the medical field and this practice is by far the most professional and experienced. I actually look forward to seeing the providers and the staff are always pleasant and extremely helpful.”\n\nKrista\n\nPatient since 1994"
