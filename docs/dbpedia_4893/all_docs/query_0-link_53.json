        "text": "Brian Dooley\n\nCitation Information: Dooley, Brian. Excerpts from Black and Green. The Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland and Black America. Pluto Press: London, 1998. Reprinted here by permission of Pluto Press.\n\nBlack and Green. The Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland and Black America. p. 46-48.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, he (Currie) was familiar with the political struggles of the American civil rights movement ‘and very much aware of the constitutional and legal background to it’. In October 1967, Currie warned Stormont that if social reforms weren’t forthcoming extra-parliamentary activity would be introduced within a year.\n\nWhile Currie’s perception of the US civil rights movement was based on his formal studies and through the media, for other activists the influence was more direct. Derry radicals O Dochartaigh and Eamonn McCann both spent time working in London in the mid-1960s. For McCann, this meant exposure to the international left, joining the anti-nuclear Aldermaston march, and involvement in the beginnings of the anti-Vietnam War movement. By 1966, he says, he ‘would have known quite a lot about (black American radical) Stokely Carmichael and political splits between the Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee and the NAACP’. In fact, McCann met Carmichael at a conference in London in the mid 1960s, where McCann spoke about discrimination in Northern Ireland.\n\nO Dochartaigh, meanwhile, was encountering the US civil rights movement via his membership of the Connolly Association, a London-based socialist Republican organisation dedicated to the ideals of Irish revolutionary James Connolly, executed for his part in the 1916 Easter Rising. The Connolly Association’s membership base was drawn from the Irish community living in England, Scotland and Wales, and it produced a newspaper, the Irish Democrat, which reported on the struggle for civil rights in Northern Ireland and in the US. As early as February 1964, the Irish Democrat produced an editorial which declared that discrimination in Northern Ireland ‘is the exact parallel of the Negro question in the United States, for in that country the freedom of the people as a whole is dependent entirely on the emancipation of the coloured people.’\n\nThe following year, the Democrat reminded readers of Cromwell’s part in shipping thousands of Irish to plantations in the Caribbean, and suggested that the Irish living in Britain had much in common with their West Indian neighbours, and featured a photograph of Catholic nuns from the New York archdiocese taking part in a civil rights march in Harlem. O Dochartaigh became a correspondent for the Irish Democrat on his return to Derry in 1966, and remembers the influence of the paper’s international page in comparing American blacks with the position of Catholics in Northern Ireland. The international page carried a long piece in February 1967 expanding on the similarities between Northern Ireland and the American South:\n\n…there is regional discrimination siting industry away from coloured area — just as industries are kept to the Lagan valley of Ulster, while [Catholic areas like] Newry, Derry and Strabane do without. There are negroes’ jobs and white man’s jobs — just as there are Catholic and Protestant jobs in the six counties …there are whole trades where negroes do not work and are not encouraged to work. This goes for Catholics in the six counties also…Irish people should take an interest in and support the struggle for negro rights in the U.S.A.\n\nThe experience of the American civil rights movement and its increasingly apparent similarities with the situation in Northern Ireland meant that some sort of direct action was likely. In June 1968, Austin Currie suggested to the Nationalist Party’s annual conference that a campaign of civil disobedience should be adopted. On 20 June, he took action himself in an incident which drew more attention to the issue of discrimination than anything that had happened before. Currie, who had been looking for an opportunity for some time to make a dramatic gesture, heard of a house being allocated to Emily Beattie, a 19-year old unmarried Protestant woman in an area where 269 people were on a housing waiting list. ‘This was the perfect symbol. I said at the time that if I live to be hundred I’ll never get a better case to symbolise the situation in Northern Ireland,’ he said.\n\nCurrie went to the house in Caledon on the morning of the day the woman was due to move in and, with two other\n\n…broke a back window with a poker and got into the house and barricaded ourselves in…we continued to be barricaded in the house for a number of hours. Eventually the RUC arrived and they and Emily Beattie’s brother battered down the front door and ejected us straight in to the cameras.\n\nThe incident was carried on the BBC evening television news. For many people in Britain, it was the first they had heard of religious discrimination in Northern Ireland, and it made a bigger impact on the British public than all the CSJ documents of the previous four years. Currie recalled that he wanted to maintain the momentum in the media with a civil rights march.\n\nI put the proposal [to Conn McCluskey] that it was time to get away from just disseminating facts and figures, time to get away from the civil liberty group in Britain upon which they had based the civil rights association up to then and to take it to the streets."
