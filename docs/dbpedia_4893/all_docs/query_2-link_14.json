        "text": "Gov. Ned Lamont chose CRT’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg Women’s Empowerment Center to announce a new state website and hotline for women’s reproductive services. Gov. Lamont, and other key state and local leaders, discussed the importance of this reproductive-rights resource.\n\nThe new reproductive rights hotline and website offers information about:\n\n• Understanding your rights\n\n• Finding a provider\n\n• Paying for an abortion\n\n• Transportation and travel\n\n• Resources for health care professionals and providers\n\n• Community support\n\nPlease visit https://portal.ct.gov/reproductiverights or call 1-866-CTCHOICE to speak to someone about abortion in Connecticut.\n\nCRT’s Women’s Empowerment Center opened in May 2019. It offers access to meaningful mentorships and provides a safe and open space for women to develop the skills they need to reach their full potential.\n\nCheck out WTNH’s coverage of the Press Conference:\n\nhttps://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/state-leaders-unveil-services-providing-information-on-reproductive-rights-in-conn/\n\n/\n\nhttps://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2161-scaled.jpg 1920 2560 Irene Mackey https://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/community-renewal-team-logo.svg Irene Mackey2022-08-09 14:50:412022-08-09 17:00:14Gov. Lamont and Others Announce a New State Website and Hotline for Women’s Reproductive Services\n\nLocal, award-winning artist Micaela Levesque selected to complete massive mural at 330 Market Street in Hartford\n\nHartford – The Community Renewal Team (CRT) is sponsoring the creation of a massive public mural that will be painted on the side of its multi-service center in Hartford (330 Market St.) to honor the life-long commitment to women’s rights and social justice of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, along with other remarkable women leaders. The artist chosen to complete the work for CRT is East Hartford resident Micaela Levesque, whose vibrant artistic vision and skilled portrait work will make this mural a landmark for downtown Hartford for years to come.\n\n“After a long, and rigorous search process, CRT is thrilled to have chosen Ms. Levesque to complete this important mural on our behalf,” said CRT’s President and CEO, Lena Rodriguez. “We can think of no better way to honor RBG’s legacy than to ensure that her memory lives on through the work of CRT’s Women’s Empowerment Center. Justice Ginsburg’s accomplishments will be felt for decades to come. We know that all women in our community today – especially the next generation that is coming of age now – are better off because of her.”\n\nIn addition to prominently featuring Justice Ginsburg, the mural will also showcase the following female leaders:\n\nVice President of the United States Kamala Harris;\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor;\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama; and\n\nElla Grasso, the first woman elected Governor in Connecticut and in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the five portraits that will be featured in the mural, the artist plans to add a variety of painted symbols that will add to the depth and complexity of the finished work of art.\n\nMs. Levesque previously won the “Best in Show” award at CRT’s 2020 National Arts Program show in Hartford for a painting of her self-portrait.\n\n“The ideas of this mural align perfectly with my own artistic vision,” said artist Micaela Levesque. “When I learned that this RBG-inspired mural would be on the side of the building for CRT’s Women’s Empowerment Center, I knew I wanted to be involved. I am so excited to bring a visual representation of these iconic women to Hartford. You will see that I am going to put myself completely into this project and will be so proud to stand behind the finished work.”\n\nThe building where the mural will be painted houses CRT’s Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Women’s Empowerment Center in Hartford, which offers a safe and open space for women from Hartford and Middlesex Counties to develop the skills they need to reach their full potential.\n\nThe goal of CRT’s Women’s Empowerment Center is to encourage women to find stable careers, establish financial security, and commit themselves to life-long personal growth and success. The Center provides specialized and holistic case management, support groups, financial literacy and personal development classes, intensive one-on-one mentorship, entrepreneurship, and leadership training to help women thrive.\n\nThe Center also offers members networking opportunities to meet successful women from various backgrounds and careers. These opportunities are essential to bridge gaps derived from economic barriers and other social determinants. Relationships developed through these networks build pathways to better futures.\n\nCRT’s Women’s Empowerment Center meets a critical regional need. Of the female-headed households living in Hartford, 46.6% do not have a spouse or partner present (source). Additionally, 29% of females living in Hartford are living below the poverty line (source). CRT has a history of offering female-centric initiatives (e.g., helping women gain employment skills, leave abusive circumstances, decrease substance use and recidivism, and enabling grandparents, particularly grandmothers, to raise their grandchildren). CRT’s Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Women’s Empowerment Center represents the culmination of these efforts.\n\nWork on this massive mural – it is expected that it will be visible to passing cars on I-91 – began on August 17, 2021, and Ms. Levesque anticipates completing the project in approximately five weeks.\n\nWhile it will be possible for the public to see the work being done to complete the mural over the next five weeks, a public unveiling and celebration of this tribute to RBG and other women leaders is being planned for mid-September (exact date to be announced).\n\nThis mural was made possible by a Neighborhood Beautification grant from the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving.\n\n###\n\nEditor’s Note: Artist Micaela Levesque is available for media interviews, upon request. It is anticipated that Ms. Levesque will be on-site painting six days a week, from 10 am – 7 pm each day, with a one-hour break per day.\n\nAdditionally, high resolution files of conceptual sketches by the artist depicting what the mural may look like upon completion are available for publication.\n\n/\n\nhttps://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RBGMuralConceptArt_MicaelaLevesque-Crop.jpg 563 564 Jason Black https://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/community-renewal-team-logo.svg Jason Black2021-08-18 13:57:402021-08-20 19:52:53CRT Will Honor Legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Other Women Leaders with Powerful Mural for Women’s Empowerment Center in Downtown Hartford\n\nFree 14-week online course begins Sept. 7, 2021, open to adults (18 and over) in the Greater Hartford area\n\nHartford – The Community Renewal Team’s (CRT) annual Financial Literacy Institute is now accepting applications for the fall semester.

And now the service can provide transportation to COVID-19 vaccine appointments, too.\n\nThe RSVP Greater Hartford/Central CT Volunteer Medical Transportation Program has been bridging this transportation gap providing thousands of trips to seniors and veterans in multiple cities and town in Central Connecticut since its inception in January 2016.\n\nThe VMT program has grown to include eight cities/towns: Berlin, Cromwell, New Britain, Plainville, Southington, Suffield, Windsor, and Windsor Locks.\n\nNeed a Ride from the VMT Program?\n\nSeniors and veterans requesting rides for the first time call the RSVP office (860-519-3484) and provide initial client information along with anticipated future needs for this free service. From that point forward, they will be in our system and can simply call and provide their specific ride request when needed.\n\nStart Serving as a Volunteer Driver Today\n\n“You can help meet the transportation needs of seniors and veterans in the communities we serve by volunteering with RSVP as one of our regular drivers,” said Strong. “Seniors will greatly appreciate your service, because you make it possible for them to continue living in their own homes and still have access to all the medical services that they need.”\n\nAs a volunteer driver with the VMT program, you will be on an on-call list along with other volunteers. When new requests for service come in, volunteers receive a notification and can pick and choose the appointments that fit in with their schedule.\n\nWith this volunteer call-list system, we can provide seniors and veterans with access to a free, reliable, non-emergency medical transportation service.\n\nTo become a Volunteer Medical Transportation driver you must:\n\nBe at least 55 years of age\n\nHave a good driving record\n\nHold a current and valid driver’s license\n\nHave liability automobile insurance coverage\n\nDrive an automobile that is in a safe, road-worthy condition\n\nProvide information for criminal background screening\n\nRegister & train as an RSVP volunteer – contact information below\n\nMileage reimbursement: Funding is provided to reimburse volunteers of the Medical Transportation program for their mileage to and from their own residence.\n\nMileage reimbursement is paid to volunteer drivers from the time they leave their home to their clients’ destination and back at the rate of 36 cents per mile. (Note: This is less than the federal rate, so volunteers do not need to claim on their income taxes as income.)\n\nInsurance for drivers: RSVP provides insurance coverage on all members through secondary personal liability and accidental death & dismemberment policies. Your coverage is in effect from the moment you leave your home, and while you are engaged in volunteer activities, until you return.\n\nHow to Get Involved: For more information about this valuable program – either to become a volunteer, or to request a future ride – please email Theresa Strong at: [email protected].\n\nFunding for this program is provided in part by the Older Americans Act through the North Central Area Agency on Aging and AmeriCorps Seniors. In addition, annual donations are made from local cities/towns, and private citizens/businesses.\n\nEditor’s Note: Staff from CRT’s RSVP are available for interviews about this free transportation program.\n\nFor more information, please contact CRT’s Communications Director, Jason Black at 860-230-4535.\n\n###\n\n/\n\nhttps://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RSVP_MTVPdriver3-crop.jpg 1196 1600 Jason Black https://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/community-renewal-team-logo.svg Jason Black2021-04-15 12:38:232021-07-20 17:03:01CRT’s RSVP Medical Transportation Volunteer Program Provides Free Roundtrip Rides to Seniors and Veterans for Medical Appointments\n\nHartford – Spring may be here, but many of us are still worried about those home-heating bills! Do you know how you will pay to heat your home this year? Will you have the financial resources to do so?\n\nIf you are worried about how you will pay these big monthly expenses, the Community Renewal Team (CRT) may be able to assist you with your home-heating costs!\n\nFortunately, the deadline for all eligible households to apply for the CT Energy Assistance Program has been extended to Tuesday, June 15, 2021!\n\nCRT can help individuals and families complete the application by phone, email, or in-person at our multi-service center in Hartford located at 395 Wethersfield Ave., Hartford.\n\nThe Connecticut Energy Assistance Program is available to both homeowners and renters living in Connecticut to help them cover their home-heating expenses during these difficult times.\n\nCRT is encouraging everyone throughout the state of Connecticut to find out if they qualify for this FREE program.\n\nWho qualifies to receive help from the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program?\n\nThere are income eligibility requirements to qualify for the CT Energy Assistance Program, and the Community Renewal Team can help you check to see if you are qualified.\n\nIn fact, the income eligibility requirements, per household, are quite generous – there is no harm in checking to see if you qualify, and there’s no shame in using this important service!\n\nAccording to the Connecticut Department of Social Services, decisions regarding eligibility are based on the number of people living in your household. Specifically, household size includes both homeowners and renters that pay separately for heat; AND renters whose heat is included in the rent, as long as more than 30% of gross income is paid towards rent.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor a single person, the income level is up to $37,645.\n\nFor two people in the home, the income level is up to $49,228.\n\nFor a household of 4 people, the income level is up to $72,394.\n\nSo again, many more people may be qualified this year than previously thought possible – it is worth checking to find out!\n\nWhat types of home-heating options are covered by the CT Energy Assistance Program?\n\nFor those who qualify for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, home-heating assistance pays for a household’s primary heating source, and this includes many different ways to heat your home. Heating sources include: oil, natural gas, electricity, propane, kerosene, coal, and even wood and wood pellets.\n\nHow do I apply for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program?\n\nCRT maintains a call center with representatives ready to speak with individuals and help them complete their application over the phone. The call center representatives speak both English and Spanish.\n\nIf you live in Central Connecticut (i.e., Hartford County or Middlesex County), the fastest way to apply for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program is to call CRT’s Energy Assistance Hotline @ 860-560-5800.\n\nNOTE: Due to COVID-19, ALL Applications can be taken over the phone – this is for the health and safety of both CRT’s staff, and for the individuals applying for Energy Assistance.\n\nOutside of Central Connecticut, please call 2-1-1 to find the Community Action Agency that can assist you.\n\nCRT’s hotline number is: 860-560-5800, and it is available 24-hours a day – if you leave a message, someone will get back to you!\n\nYou can also visit the Energy Assistance Page for more information.\n\nFor more information, please contact CRT’s Communications Director, Jason Black at 860-230-4535.\n\n/\n\nhttps://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Radiator_graes-magazine-unsplash800.jpg 540 800 Jason Black https://www.crtct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/community-renewal-team-logo.svg Jason Black2021-03-22 15:23:032021-07-20 17:03:34Application Deadline for CT Energy Assistance Program Extended to June 15, 2021 – CRT Can Help You Apply Now\n\nHARTFORD — As they say in the arts, “The show must go on!” And this year is no exception for the Community Renewal Team’s (CRT) 30th Annual National Arts Program® (NAP) for artists of all ages and skill levels, from Middlesex and Hartford Counties who are invited to submit their work now for the 2021 art show, which for the first time will be entirely virtual.\n\nTo accommodate the safety needs of the artists, judges, and guests who will view the artistic work submitted, this year’s National Arts show will be hosted in an online gallery format.
