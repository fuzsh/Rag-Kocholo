        "text": "Hello, my name is Jack McCluskey and I am in the middle of my repeat junior year of high school at the Canterbury School in New Milford Connecticut. My goal now for a very long time is to run at the collegiate level while gaining an education that will further my success in the future! I am the type of kid who will give you everything they have until the last ounce is completely out of me. On every team I have been on since a very young age I have been recognized as a leader on and off the playing field. I was one of three selected captains this year on my cross country team as it is only my second year at this school. Playing two varsity sports at such a high level has taught me how to manage my time in the classroom as well as on the ice or the courses.I will give you my absolute best in the classroom, on the field, and around campus and bring the positivity and competitiveness with me!"
