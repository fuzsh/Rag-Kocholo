Conn McCluskey set a Championship Record yesterday, at the All Ireland Schools Championships, in Tullamore. This was a great new PB for Conn (Minor Boys) with a high jump of 1.70.

Molly Mullally (Senior Girls) marked her last All Ireland Schools Championships by winning the Triple Jump, not too far off her PB, with a jump of 11.37, and she also finished 4th in the Long Jump with a good leap of 5.29. To add to these great results we had an excellent win for Lauryn Healy (Inter Girls) in the High Jump with a new PB of 1.66.

Cillian Connolly and Tim Daly, and Blackrock College also won the Inter Boys Relay with Rhys Keogh in the squad. Oatlands finished 2nd Inter Boys with Lawrence, Oscar and Daniel on the team, and also finished 3rd Senior Boys with Robert and Andrew Hayes playing a big part.
