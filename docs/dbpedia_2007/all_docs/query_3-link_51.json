These are some of the questions the cadre will help you answer for yourself as you participate in awesome, hands-on activities and tours. Specifically, our goal is to inspire you to\n\n• develop leadership skills,\n\n• learn about aviation, space, and technology,\n\n• commit to a habit of regular exercise, and\n\n• live the Core Values.\n\nAs cadets of the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary, your training will emphasize not only leadership and character, but fitness and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) as you explore career opportunities in those areas and so much more.\n\nFinancial Assistance Help with tuition and uniform expenses is available.
