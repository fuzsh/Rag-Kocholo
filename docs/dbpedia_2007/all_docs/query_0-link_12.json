We always seek out the highest quality American-made and union-label items. Your ideas and comments are always welcome.\n\nWho We Are\n\nElizabeth Wagley, publisher of The National Memo and proprietor of the National Memo Store, started her career in media at the Christian Science Monitor TV, but went on to work in the fields of human rights and public health. With twins, she has returned to media with a keen understanding of how responsible journalism educates and brings critical change. Her Bill of Rights scarf is a conversation starter on all her Zoom calls. Elizabeth can be reached via email: Elizabeth@nationalmemo.com\n\nWe’re most grateful to all our customers for their support. In these dark and challenging times, we need the sunlight of independent journalism more than ever – with an informed and engaged citizenry standing up to the forces of illiberalism and bigotry."
