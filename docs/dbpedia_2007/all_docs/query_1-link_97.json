The National Park Service adopts policies and procedures to carry out the intent of the laws, regulations, and higher-level authorities that govern management of the national parks and National Park Service programs.\n\nThe NPS Directives System is the basic source of Service-wide policies and required or recommended practices and procedures. It consists of three levels of documents that comprise a policy reference library."
