        "text": "Some people may receive unsolicited phone calls, emails, or other communications from individuals fraudulently claiming to be from the Tax Court, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or Federal government agencies and demanding immediate payment by money order, gift card, debit card, or other means to settle a tax debt.\n\nThe Tax Court does not want anyone to be victimized by a tax scam. It is important that you know that the Tax Court will never do any of the following:\n\ncall or email demanding payment of immigration visa application fees or taxes;\n\ncall or email threatening arrest;\n\ncall or email insisting that a specific payment method be used to pay Court fees, a tax debt, or requesting credit or debit card numbers over the phone.\n\nThe IRS posts current warnings and alerts about all types of tax scams on its website (including information about how to report tax scams). In addition, you may file a consumer complaint about a tax scam with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These websites are maintained by the FTC and FBI â€” government agencies that are unrelated to the Tax Court.\n\nIf you would like to verify that the communication you received is really from the Tax Court please call the Court at (202) 521-0700."
