        "text": "To help meet the goals of FEMA’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, FEMA re-established the Public Assistance Steering Committee.\n\nThe committee is an advisory group of state, territorial, tribal and local government representatives designed to help improve the Public Assistance process for applicants. The committee first convened in 2017 to provide real-world partner perspectives, inform strategic program changes and discuss overall program improvements.\n\nImprovements\n\nFEMA is now beginning to implement proposed changes from the committee. Below is a listing of items the agency is doing to improve the Public Assistance process. These measures will be formally adopted and included in future versions of the “Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide.”\n\nSimplifying the Processes\n\nIn March 2022, FEMA made the first changes based on recommendations to help speed recovery efforts and reduce applicant burdens.\n\nSimplified documentation requirements for unobligated projects.\n\nWaved the requirement that unobligated projects with completed small projects must be prepared based on actual costs.\n\nAdjusted the deadline for projects with work already completed.\n\nBegan deploying technical experts from FEMA Consolidated Resource Centers to aid project scoping and development for complex operations and projects.\n\nReleased the “Public Assistance Sampling Procedure” to reduce documentation level requirements.\n\nProvided examples allowing a FEMA Regional Administrator to approve time extensions for project closeout.\n\nStreamline Public Assistance\n\nIn September 2022, FEMA took these additional steps to streamline Public Assistance.\n\nAllowed additional flexibility in costs claimed for power restoration work.\n\nEliminated size requirements for the eligibility of the removal of hazardous trees, limbs, branches, and stumps for debris removal projects.\n\nAllowed applicants to develop cost estimates faster without using consensus-based codes in 50% rule calculations.\n\nNot requiring separate cost analysis from work performed through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact during disaster response and recovery operations.\n\nSimplifying Management Cost\n\nIn March 2023, FEMA released a Memo “Simplifying the Public Assistance Program - Management Costs” to further streamline Public Assistance as it relates to Management Costs documentation for force account labor.\n\nFEMA now accepts a summary of force account labor and equipment costs incurred for administration and management of PA awards. The summary should capture work and costs being claimed, including:\n\nnumber of employees;\n\nlist of equipment used and the equipment rates;\n\ntotal labor and equipment hours (or miles for vehicles) spent during the time frame;\n\ntotal labor and equipment costs; and\n\ngeneral description of all tasks performed by individuals during the time frame.\n\nApplicant funding is still based on actual costs incurred, but FEMA now requires less detailed documentation as a starting point.\n\nDetailed documentation will only be requested if additional review is necessary due to questions or concerns. Recipients and Subrecipients are still required to retain actual cost documentation pursuant to federal record retention regulations and may be asked to provide documentation for audits or to support appeals or arbitration cases.\n\nIndependent Assessment of FEMA’s Public Assistance Program Now Available\n\nEffective Jan. 20, 2023, the findings and recommendations of the 2022 Public Assistance (PA) Assessment are now available.\n\nThe purpose of the PA assessment was to determine if the PA National Delivery Model and the establishment of the Consolidated Resource Centers were meeting the original design intent from 2017 to standardize PA Program delivery; increase accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity; and improve timeliness and accessibility for processing grants for states, localities, Tribal Nations, and territories (SLTT). A contract to conduct the assessment was secured in early 2022.\n\nThe resulting independent report will aid in meeting the agency’s commitment to simplify and streamline program requirements, reduce the burden on stakeholders/applicants and expand access to PA grant funding.\n\nRead the Report\n\nKey Findings\n\nPA assessment key findings include the following:\n\nThe PA National Delivery Model has increased transparency and accuracy in the execution of the PA Program.\n\nThe obligation of over $50 billion in almost three years (March 2020- December 2022) in response to COVID-19, compared to an average of $5-8 billion per year outside of COVID-19 events (2018-2020), may not be possible without the PA National Delivery Model.\n\nPA assessment recommendations include:\n\nBuild more flexibility into the delivery of the PA Program through re-evaluating existing Consolidated Resource Center operating procedures and increasing FEMA staff deployments to partner with stakeholders.\n\nInstitute an approach for the PA Program to identify and elevate possible policy or processing inconsistencies for resolution.\n\nAdjust the current policy development and publication process to reduce confusion for internal and external stakeholders.\n\nApply a unified risk-based approach to delivering the PA Program to streamline program requirements and promote consistency.\n\nIncrease training opportunities, including a focus on building targeted skillsets for those that execute the PA Program, to enhance customer service.\n\nConsistently engage FEMA Regions, applicants, and recipients when updating PA Program policy or processes to support effective change management.\n\nFEMA’s efforts to address the recommendations from the PA assessment are well underway and will continue throughout 2023 and future years as needed."
