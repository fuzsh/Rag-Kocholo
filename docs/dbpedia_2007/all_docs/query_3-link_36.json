        "text": "Title 38 U.S.C. Section 2021\n\n\"...the Secretary of Labor shall conduct, directly or through grant or contract, such programs as the Secretary determines appropriate to provide job training, counseling, and placement services (including job readiness and literacy and skills training) to expedite the reintegration of homeless veterans into the labor force.\"\n\nThe Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP) is an employment focused competitive grant program of the Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and Training Service (DOL-VETS), the only federal grant to focus exclusively on competitive employment for homeless veterans. Initially authorized in 1987 under Section 738 of Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, HVRP and its companion programs are currently authorized under Title 38 U.S.C. Sections 2021, 2021A and 2023.\n\nThe Goals of the Grant Program are to:\n\nProvide career exploration, training, placement, and supportive services to veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness, empowering them to secure good jobs in stable, high-demand occupations paying livable wages.\n\nEstablish strong partnerships between public, private, and nonprofit organizations, especially those that employ and partner with veterans who have experienced homelessness, to deliver equitable services to marginalized veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness to assist in overcoming barriers to employment.\n\nHVRP grant recipients accomplish these goals through a variety of core services:\n\nKnowledge of Population\n\nGrant recipients understand the unique needs of the veterans they serve and structure to meet those needs.\n\nOutreach\n\nGrant recipients use a flexible, non-threatening approach to meet veterans where they are. Outreach also includes activities to engage partners and employers.\n\nAssessment / Intake\n\nGrant recipients assess each veteran to determine program eligibility and to gauge job readiness and willingness to engage in employment services.\n\nCase Management\n\nGrant recipients use a veteran-centered approach to develop an Individual Employment Plan (IEP) based on individual's strengths and preferences while addressing barriers.\n\nJob driven Training and Placement\n\nGrant recipients provide training that is targeted to the specific industries, occupations, and skills that are in demand locally. Training services can be provided in-house, through partners in the community, or through the local American Job Center.\n\nCollaboration\n\nGrant recipients collaborate with public and private partners at all levels (federal, state and local) to provide supportive services and access to housing.\n\nNational Priorities and Local Implementation\n\nHVRP serves:\n\nVeterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness\n\nHomeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children\n\nJustice-involved veterans\n\nThe HVRP establishes national priorities for the overall program. Each HVRP grant recipient contributes to these priorities by placing veterans in these populations into competitive employment at the local level.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2024 HVRP Terms and Conditions (PDF) Updated July 2024\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2023 HVRP Terms and Conditions (PDF)\n\nList of Current Grantees (nvtac.org)\n\nProgram Documents\n\nGOTR TPR/TPN Checklist (PDF)\n\nOn-site Assessment Form 2017 (PDF)\n\nAt-Risk Income Eligibility Calculator (XLSB) Updated July 11, 2024\n\nHVRP Budget Narrative Template (XLSB) Updated March 29, 2024\n\nHVRP Award Amendments Change Request Form (XLSB) Updated April 1, 2024\n\nActive Policy Guidance\n\nVETS policies are on the Policy Guidance | U.S. Department of Labor page.
