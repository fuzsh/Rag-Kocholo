        "text": "What are PFAS?\n\nPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are a large class of chemicals found in many consumer products, as well as in industrial products such as certain firefighting agents called aqueous film forming foam (AFFF). PFAS is also found in essential use applications such as in microelectronics, batteries and medical equipment.\n\nTwo types of PFAS – perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – are components of legacy Aqueous Film Forming Foam the Air Force began using in the 1970s as a firefighting agent to extinguish petroleum fires; AFFF provides essential burn-back resistance, protection against vapor release and rapid extinguishment.\n\nThere is significant attention on PFAS releases from DoD activities and the subsequent potential impact to human health and the environment. The presence of PFAS in the environment is a national issue due to its wide-spread use in many industrial and consumer products. The Department of the Air Force recognizes the importance of this issue and is committed to addressing PFAS in a deliberative, holistic, and transparent manner.\n\nFor more information, visit the FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS page.\n\nPFAS in the Environment\n\nWhen released into the environment, PFAS can enter the soil and migrate through surface water (including lakes and rivers) and groundwater. In some cases, these waters serve as a source of drinking water for individuals (private water wells) or a municipality. Not all groundwater is used for drinking water, and the groundwater that is used for drinking water is often treated before consumption. This treatment ensures that the water that is ultimately consumed by the public is safe and meets all state and federal requirements for water quality. Additional information about PFAS in drinking water and PFAS in groundwater and DoD’s investigation efforts are included here.\n\nReports indicate most people in the United States have been exposed to PFAS and have PFAS in their blood. The Department looks to and supports the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and state health departments’ ongoing PFAS environmental exposure and health effects research correlating blood levels to adverse health impacts. Additional information regarding PFAS exposure can be found on the EPA website (https://www.epa.gov/pfas) and on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry website (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/).\n\nAir Force Response\n\nThe Air Force’s PFAS investigation work and mitigation actions are guided by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and applicable state laws.\n\nLearn more about CERCLA\n\nElimination of the Use of Aqueous Film Forming Foam\n\nIn September 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced the first qualified fluorine-free foam (F3) for use, initiating the replacement of AFFF for firefighting activities at military installations. Additional F3 products that meet the specification requirements have since been qualified and approved for use by the Military Departments. The Air Force has started the transition process.\n\nIn addition, the Air Force is taking additional steps to reduce or eliminate unnecessary foam releases by:\n\n• Locking out and removing AFFF tanks from hangar fire suppression systems.\n\n• Conducting fire training exercises in double-lined pits to prevent soil and groundwater impacts.\n\n• Treating any uncontained releases of AFFF as if it were a hazardous-material spill and requiring immediate cleanup."
