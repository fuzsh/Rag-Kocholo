        "text": "Four of North Carolina’s Administrative Law Judges have chambers in county courthouses outside of Wake County. Judge Jonathan S. Dills is the resident administrative law judge in the High Point, Guilford County Courthouse. Judge Selina Malherbe is the resident administrative law judge in the Mecklenburg County Courthouse. Judge Samuel K. Morris is the resident administrative law judge in the Jacksonville, Onslow County Courthouse. Judge David F. Sutton is the resident administrative law judge in the Haywood County Courthouse.\n\nWhen contested cases are scheduled to be heard in these courthouses, the emergency crisis administrative orders and protocols issued by the Senior Resident Superior Court judges in those counties control. These orders and protocols supersede the directives issued by the Chief Administrative Law Judge for the Raleigh headquarters of the Office of Administrative Hearings. You may find a copy of the Administrative Orders governing those counties respectively at one of the following links: Guilford County, Haywood County, Onslow County, Mecklenburg County.\n\nIn addition, when contested cases are scheduled to be heard in any of North Carolina’s one hundred counties, the emergency crisis administrative orders and protocols of the respective Senior Resident Superior Court judge controls all aspects of the hearings in those county courthouses. These emergency orders can be found on the website of the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts at the following link: https://www.nccourts.gov/locations\n\nThe Rules Review Commission (RRC) is the executive agency created by the General Assembly in 1986 and is charged with reviewing and approving rules adopted by state agencies. The statutory authority for the RRC is found in two places. The authority for the RRC itself is G.S. 143B-30.1 and following. The Commission’s substantive review procedures are set by the General Assembly and are codified in the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 150B, Articles 1 and 2A.\n\nLearn more about the RRC"
