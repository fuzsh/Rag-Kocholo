        "text": "CISA has updated the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) 3.0 training course on the Federal Virtual Training Environment (FedVTE) Learning Content Management System (LCMS). The training offers a comprehensive overview of the modernized TIC initiative, as mandated by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum (M) 19-26, and explains how agencies can harness the updated TIC 3.0 guidance to bolster their cybersecurity posture. The training includes the new TIC 3.0 Cloud Use Case and updates the Branch Office Use Case, the Remote User Use Case, and the Security Capabilities Catalog. Additionally, the training provides insights into leveraging TIC 3.0 guidance to ensure a secure migration to cloud environments and establish a robust foundation for implementing a zero-trust security framework.\n\nThe training is designed with the following Learning Objectives:\n\nIdentify the goals of the modernized TIC initiative and the guidance available to help agencies.\n\nLearn about how to implement the TIC 3.0 guidance and how it complements other federal initiatives.\n\nLeverage the flexibilities available in TIC 3.0 to secure hybrid and cloud environments.\n\nUnderstand how to use the TIC 3.0 guidance as a pathway to implementing zero trust.\n\nTo access the updated FedVTE TIC 3.0 Training, click on the link: FedVTE TIC 3.0 Training. Upon reaching FedVTE website, log in to existing account using email and password. New users can register by clicking “Register Here”. After logging in, navigate to the “Cybersecurity Courses” section. Select “All Cybersecurity Courses” and use the search bar to find the course titled “Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) 3.0”. Once you locate the course, simply click on “Start Course” to begin. When starting the course, you will see some buttons to control the course:\n\nTop left:\n\nClicking on the three-dash icon displays the search function, course outline, replay content, or exit.\n\nClicking on the paper icon shows transcript notes for the current slide.\n\nClicking on speaker icon enables play or pause audio.\n\nClicking on the play or pause button starts or stops the audio narration.\n\nTop Right:\n\nClicking on the arrows permits moving to the next or previous slide.\n\nBottom Right:\n\nA next button appears after the narration finishes to take you to the next slide.\n\nOMB M-19-26 tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with modernizing the TIC initiative to help accelerate the adoption of cloud, mobile, and other emerging technologies. To further this effort, CISA has released guidance to assist federal civilian agencies in their transition to contemporary architectures and services.\n\nThe updated TIC guidance provides agencies with the flexibility to secure distinctive computing scenarios in accordance with their unique risk tolerance levels. Agencies are expected to reference the initiative’s Program Guidebook, Reference Architecture, and Security Capabilities Catalog to determine how to protect their environments to conform with their risk management strategy and the security considerations outlined in TIC use cases.\n\nThe TIC 3.0 Cloud Use Case is the final document of the “initial Common TIC Use Cases” outlined in the OMB M-19-26. The TIC use cases posted to this site are not an exhaustive representation of all the scenarios agencies may wish to consider when securing their environments. Agencies are encouraged to combine uses cases, as appropriate, to suit their needs.\n\nLinks directly to pdf versions of the TIC guidance can be found at the bottom of the page: Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) 3.0 Core Guidance Documents, under Resource Materials.\n\nTIC Use Cases\n\nThe modernized initiative, M-19-26, no longer requires agencies to route traffic through TIC access points if they have a TIC alternative. The purpose of TIC use cases is to provide agencies with guiderails for implementing TIC 3.0 in scenarios that do not necessarily require the use of a TIC access point. The use cases supplement the guidance detailed in the Reference Architecture.\n\nTIC use cases provide guidance on the secure implementation and configuration of specific platforms, services, and environments. The guidance is derived from TIC pilots and best practices from the public and private sector. Each use case identifies security architectures, data flows, and environments applicable in a given scenario and describes the implementation of relevant TIC security capabilities. TIC use cases articulate:\n\nNetwork scenarios for TIC implementation,\n\nSecurity patterns commonly used within the federal civilian enterprise, and\n\nTechnology-agnostic methods for securing current and emerging network models.\n\nTIC use cases are designed to be general architectures for securing specific scenarios that agencies can use as a framework to build their own use cases custom to their mission needs and risk tolerances.\n\nAgencies must understand the inherent risks in implementing scenarios that do not leverage TIC access points. Agencies must leverage the use cases, in coordination with guidance from their senior officials accountable for risk management, to implement compensating controls that fortify their network and cloud environments. Additional information on use cases can be found in the Use Case Handbook.\n\nThe TIC Cloud Use Case is the final use case that satisfies M-19-26 requirements.\n\nTIC Use Cases and Security Capabilities Catalog agencies can refer to are listed below. The latest updates were made December 22, 2023, to Security Capabilities Catalog, Branch Office Use Case, Remote User Use Case, Cloud Use Case, and the Response to Comments on Cloud Use Case.\n\nTraditional TIC Use Case – Describes the architecture and security capabilities guidance for the conventional TIC implementation.\n\nBranch Office Use Case – Describes the architecture and security capabilities guidance for branch offices.\n\nRemote User Use Case – Describes the architecture and security capabilities guidance for remote users.\n\nCloud Use Case – Describes the architecture and security considerations for deploying different cloud services.\n\nSecurity Capabilities Catalog – Indexes security capabilities relevant to TIC.\n\nTIC & National Cybersecurity Protection System\n\nAs outlined in the TIC 3.0 Program Guidebook, TIC and the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) initiatives will continue to support and complement each other in accordance with the Federal Cybersecurity Act of 2015. However, CISA will provide independent guidance for each of the respective programs.\n\nNCPS is supporting the TIC modernization efforts via the release of its Cloud Interface Reference Architecture (NCIRA). NCIRA is being released as two individual volumes. NCIRA Volume One (pdf, 4.06MB) provides an overview of changes to NCPS that accommodate collection of relevant data from agencies’ cloud environments and provides general reporting patterns for sending cloud telemetry to CISA. NCIRA Volume Two (pdf, 3.61MB) (currently in draft) builds on the concepts presented in NCIRA Volume One and provides an index of common cloud telemetry reporting patterns and characteristics for how agencies can send cloud-specific data to NCPS. Individual cloud service providers can refer to the reporting patterns in this volume to offer guidance on their solutions that allow agencies to send cloud telemetry to CISA in fulfillment of NCPS requirements.\n\nAs agencies architect their networks to adopt the TIC 3.0 use cases, agencies are required to engage with the NCPS Program to determine the appropriate telemetry that is being shared with CISA. Please visit CISA's NCPS page for more information."
