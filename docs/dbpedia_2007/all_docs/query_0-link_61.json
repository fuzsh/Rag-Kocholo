Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”\n\nWe collect Device Information using the following technologies:\n\n“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier.

In addition, we may use your device information for advertising retargeting.\n\nSHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.

You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n\nFinally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.\n\nAs described above, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.\n\nYou can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting:\n\nFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads\n\nGOOGLE - https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous\n\nBING - https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads\n\nAdditionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.\n\nDO NOT TRACK\n\nPlease note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.\n\nYOUR RIGHTS\n\nIf you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted.
