The National Governors Association has provided platforms for Governors to communicate with each other and to easily follow what’s happening in other states across the country on a daily basis. We connect Governors and their key staff members with policy experts and thought leaders to help forge practical solutions to the challenges they face. Through our programs, we develop and share guidance so that Governors might find what works best to address the unique situations that arise in their states. By accessing the best information, communicating with federal and local levels of government, and learning from each another, Governors are successfully meeting today’s pressing challenges."
