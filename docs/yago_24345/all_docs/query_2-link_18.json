        "text": "So, after nearly 42 years, \"All My Children\" ended its run today. I was pretty sad. It's more than a show, you know?\n\nAnyway, one of my ways of dealing was thinking about the next generation of characters. They have enough kids to have a whole bunch of fresh storylines for years to come. I only created one just to keep the Wallingford line going since it was one of Pine Valley's first families. Older characters of course are necessary and built in. Here's my thing on how it would go with the young kids once they are grown.\n\nLila Rae Alcazar:\n\n-Daughter of Skye Chandler Quartermaine and Lorenzo Alcazar\n\n-Cousin to Lorenzo Santos\n\n-Cousin to AJ Chandler\n\nAge: 19\n\nOccupation: Tabloid photographer\n\nLila is full of mystery after growing up secretly in London. She showed up at the Chandler Mansion, wanting to be part of the Pine Valley action. There is an outstanding arrest warrant for her back home. For now, she’s in Pine Valley’s spotlight and uses that spotlight for her advantage, showing no loyalty to any Pine Valley rivalry or alliance.\n\nAJ Chandler:\n\n-Son of JR Chandler and Babe Carey\n\n-Nephew to Kathy Martin\n\n-Nephew to Jenny Martin\n\n-Nephew to Victoria Hayward\n\n- Cousin to Lila Rae Alcazar\n\n-Cousin to Lorenzo Santos\n\nAge: 21\n\nOccupation: Chandler Junior Executive\n\nHe’s disappointed with being the least successful Adam Chandler. He wants instant success but can’t get it. He might have to attempt to take Miranda’s company just to have a company to his name.\n\nVictoria Hayward\n\n-Daughter to David Hayward and Cara Castillo\n\n-Aunt to A.J.\n\n-Second cousin to James.\n\nAge: 13\n\nOccupation: High School Student\n\nShe is an intelligent girl torn between her father’s cynicism and her mother’s optimism. She’s realized her family is ostracized in many Pine Valley circles. As a result she is intentionally offbeat herself to keep from getting close to people but can’t help but being drawn to the Pine Valley social circle.\n\nWilliam Hubbard:\n\n-Son of Frankie Hubbard and Mia Saunders\n\n-Adopted brother to Lucy Mercado\n\nAge: 29\n\nOccupation: Limo driver, odd jobs\n\nWilliam came to town full of lies at first. He couldn’t get close to his birth mother due to her Fusion executive status. The Hubbards first realize he’s in town when he gets arrested for breaking and entering. He resents that his birth father was living happily ever after with a new family while he succumbed to peer pressure and got involved in some criminal activities. He can be very cruel and if a crime is committed there’s a chance he’s in on it but now he is in a town where his grandfather is the chief of police.\n\nEmma Lavery:\n\n-Daughter to Ryan and Annie Lavery\n\n-Sister to Spike\n\nAge:23\n\nOccupation: Low level newspaper person\n\nWorships her father but otherwise hates most of the town. She is something of a man stealer but is filled with too much negativity to settle down for long. She enjoys working at the paper because she’s always looking to expose secrets and see the collateral damage. The only people that can put her in her place are her father or a good sparring partner. She and her brother get into it at times but she ultimately loves him more than she outwardly shows in her behavior.\n\nSpike Lavery:\n\n-Son to Ryan Lavery and Kendall Hart\n\n-Brother to Emma\n\n-Brother to Ian\n\n-Cousin to Gabrielle and Miranda\n\nAge: 19\n\nOccupation: Student/Fusion Employee\n\nHe is best friend to Miranda Montgomery. Has a reasonably good relationship with his mother and brother but doesn’t want Fusion as his legacy. However, he knows he is his mother’s only hope for a legacy since Ian is unreliable. He often does whatever he can to maintain the family happiness even at the cost of his own happiness.\n\nJames Martin II:\n\n-Son to Jamie Martin and Maggie Stone\n\n-Nephew to Kathy\n\n-Nephew to Jenny\n\n-Second cousin to Trevor\n\n-Second cousin to Victoria\n\nAge: 13\n\nOccupation: High School Student\n\nYoung kid who is basically good but is always trying to find his place with older students such as Gabrielle Montgomery and Trevor Martin. He’s fiercely loyal to Gabrielle which makes him both a doormat and frequently caught up in her bad behavior.\n\nJenny Martin:\n\n-Daughter to Tad Martin and Krystal Carey\n\n-Sister to Kathy\n\n-Aunt to AJ\n\n-Aunt to James II\n\n-Cousin to Trevor\n\nAge: 18\n\nOccupation: Student\n\nA bit selfish and surprisingly entitled despite not being a Pine Valley millionaire. She wants a boyfriend who can take her to the top and while Ian is a Slater/Kane legacy she feels he’s too much of a slacker to get her where she needs to go. She’s a social climber at middle class status. Shares traits with her father.\n\nKathy Martin:\n\n-Daughter to Tad Martin and Dixie Cooney\n\n-Sister to Jenny\n\n-Aunt to AJ\n\n-Aunt to James II\n\n-Cousin to Trevor\n\nAge: 23\n\nOccupation: Intern at Fusion\n\nShe wants to work hard and prove herself. She sees her future in cosmetics but is worried that she will never be appreciated for who she is because her validity as a worker depends on who she is dating. This is a conflict for her as she would never accept a handout but is scared her own merits would not be good enough to achieve her dreams. She is a force of nature who will go after what she wants.\n\nTrevor Martin:\n\n-Son to Jake Martin and Amanda Dillon\n\n-Cousin to Jenny and Kathy\n\n-Second cousin to James II\n\nAge: 16\n\nOccupation: Student/ Works at Chicken Fast Food Restaurant\n\nNice guy with a habit of living outside his means in an attempt to keep his girlfriend, Gabrielle Montgomery. A fool for love, he gets in trouble as he tries in vain to be interesting enough to keep a Kane woman while his family is always trying to install values in him.\n\nLucy Mercado:\n\n-Daughter of Maya Mercado and Mookie.
