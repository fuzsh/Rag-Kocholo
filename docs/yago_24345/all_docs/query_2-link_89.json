        "text": "Greenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nJust - I tried to remember when we weren't stressed to the max. Our honeymoon may have been the best time ever. I was just hoping that maybe tonight we could feel like that for just a few hours, let you remember how much I love you, how happy I am that I'm your wife, just like that night.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nCome here.\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nWhat? What are you...\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nI remember everything. I remember it was going to be the first time that we made love as husband and wife. And I remember thinking to myself that my bullet wound was easy compared to waiting to make love to you. I wanted you so bad. I want you now. I want you right now.\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nHow long? How long have you known that you love me?\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nWell, I know - you know, I know I've been falling for a while.\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nYou didn't say a word?\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nI wouldn't let myself, not until I was absolutely dead sure.\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nThat...\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nThat I could love you as much as Leo did. You remember that day in the park when you said that you were waiting for someone to give you that kind of love, the whole heart kind? Well, now I can. My whole heart is yours.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nI got halfway to the Valley Inn, and I stopped. What the hell was I thinking?\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nI hated that you left.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nYou're my wife. You're my beautiful wife. I'd be an idiot to be anywhere else.\n\nGreenlee Smythe du Pres Lavery:\n\nI love you so much.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nI love you. This is where I should be, now and always. Come here. Come here.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo way. A kiss on the boo-boo and that makes it all better? How the hell could she be so patronizing?\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nThis is not the time...\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo, no, really, how can she do this to Bianca? After this pretty little show. She'll have her prefect baby, her perfect marriage, and her perfect life, and what the hell will Bianca have?\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nKendall, it's all right.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo, Bianca, it really isn't all right. She's not doing this to ease your pain. She's doing this to cover her own pathetic guilt. Isn't that right, Babe? Isn't that what you're doing?\n\nArabella 'Babe' Carey Cramer Chandler:\n\nNo.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nOh, really, no? ok, well you know what, you don't deserve a happily ever after, Babe, and after everything you've done, you will never, ever get it. Your fairy tale will crash and burn, and you'll deserve everything you get.\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nKendall, don't.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nAnd when the sky falls, you'll remember this day and exactly what I said.\n\nMyrtle Lum Fargate:\n\nTime to hide those spinning wheels.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nThis had to be said, Bianca. You cannot believe a word out of that girl's mouth.\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nShe's my friend!\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nShe's a user. She doesn't care who she guts on the way. She's only out for herself. Isn't that right Babe?\n\n[a semi-hysterical Brooke tries to explain the significance of Babe's pregnancy to Tad and informs him that he may be a grandfather]\n\nTad:\n\nA grandpa? Jamie's pregnant? Boy, there's a medical first.\n\nBrooke:\n\nThis isn't funny. I just had an up-close-and-personal with Pine Valley's newest cowgirl.\n\nTad:\n\nUh-huh. Babe managed to rope you in? [chuckles] See what I did there?\n\nBrooke:\n\nStop it. Babe told me that she's pregnant.\n\nTad:\n\nWell, great. That is big news. Why aren't you shrieking at Adam? She's married to HIS son.\n\nMichael Cambias:\n\nMs. Kundera can't touch me. None of you can. You know what, the funny thing is each and every one of you have tried. But your pathetic attempts to take me down have failed. And you want to know why? Because I don't stop until I get what I want. And that day has finally arrived. My mission here in Pine Valley has been accomplished. First, I took over Fusion. Which by the way, ladies, was like taking candy from a baby. Then I set my sights on enchantment. Mr. Larraby, I look forward to working with you. And to complete the triecta, as of this morning. It appears as if Adam Chandler can take his retirement to that little trout stream in Canada. I'm Chandler Enterprises new C.E.O. So, I'm sure you're wondering what that all means for you. Well, it means I own this town and everybody in it.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nI wonder if it's the number of nights that really matter. I mean, love, it's more than just the physical part. It's whether or not you connect. You can't plan who you fall in love with.\n\nJamie Martin:\n\nWell, how do you even know if it's real? I mean, so many people fall in love and go through the motions, but it's not even close.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nMaybe some people don't even get to have it.\n\nJamie Martin:\n\nOr they don't recognize it when it comes along.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nOr when you do finally get it so deep it's a part of you, only to have it taken away. You know, when I - when we couldn't find Bianca, I experienced an emptiness I've never felt before, I mean, like what it would be like if Bianca had never surfaced again. I had to put that out of my mind. I had to forget it.\n\nJamie Martin:\n\nIt's complicated - love. It's so unique every time, with every person. And when the real thing comes along, I guess we just have to hope we see it.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nOr hold onto it.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nHey, maybe you want to talk about something, you know?\n\nErica Kane:\n\nWhy on earth would I bear my scars to you?\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nMaybe I can help you, be a friend.\n\nErica Kane:\n\nA friend? Oh, no. Please, no more friends, please. I have had it up to here with people who have claimed to be my friend. Who say that they only mean well and they want to help me and they only have my best interest at heart.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nThat sounds like someone who's been burned pretty badly.\n\nErica Kane:\n\nDon't shrink me, Mr. Slater. I can see straight through you. Yeah, be hind this nice, sympathetic smile is someone that wants something.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nLike what?\n\nErica Kane:\n\nWell, why don't you tell me? You're the one who activated your, ahem, search engine. How would you like it if I did a little sneak peek into your past, did a little search on you? Everyone is hiding something, Mr. Slater. How deep and dark are your secrets? Oh, I am very sure you're hiding quite a lot, but you know what, I don't care, keep your secrets to yourself. The last thing I need in this world is another so-called friend that I should trust my life with, because it only dead-ends in betrayal.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nYou want to tell me what the hell you were trying to pull out there?\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nDid you see Babe? Did you just see what she did? She has the nerve to offer a consolation prize, honorary mommy? What the hell is that? I mean, what could Bianca possibly do with that? Sit and watch Babe be the mother that Bianca will never get to be? It's stupid. It reeks.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nBabe was just trying to help.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo, Babe was trying to cover her own butt and make herself look good. She was trying to show what a big heart she has so no one will know what a liar she really is.\n\nRyan Lavery:\n\nWhat? Where do you get this stuff?\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nOh, please don't tell me you can't see it, Ryan, come on. Babe is all about playing the bimbo matriarch of the Chandler clan. When really she a selfish, lying, stupid little b*tch.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo, the big diva has not song yet. Ryan and I are not over.\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nHello? Ryan is not here. Ryan left with his wife.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nOh, so what? That's just a pesky little detail. It doesn't matter. And, hey, aren't you the cheerleader who told me to go after Ryan and never give up on love?\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nThat was before Ryan put a ring on Greenlee's finger.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nDetails - blah, blah, blah. Forget them. Just focus on the big picture and never lose heart, because I know in mine - I know in my heart, Bianca, I'm right. I know I'm right. Ryan doesn't want to give up on me any more than our mother wants to give up popping champagne corks.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nRemember when we kissed? Or when I kissed you?\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nIt's kind of hard to forget.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nAnd I, blew it off, like it didn't mean anything.\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nYeah.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nIt was a big fat lie. That kiss, and that whole moment, hasn't left me yet. And I think about it, and I think about you, and I think about doing it again. Bianca, I think I love you.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nI mean I swore to you I wasn't gay. I told you that I loved you, just not 'like that.' And now here I am telling you that I do love you like that... I think. I don't know. Can you please tell me again how did you know that you were gay?\n\nBianca Montgomery:\n\nWell, it wasn't like somebody flipped a switch. I think I always knew somewhere deep inside. I just didn't want to admit it, deal with it. I mean come on, how could Erica Kane's daughter be a lesbian, right? And then finally I did admit it to myself, who I was and I accepted it.\n\nMaggie Stone:\n\nI just wish I knew what that meant. Accepting what? Admitting what? Am I gay? Or is it just you? Am I a straight girl who has a crush on a gay friend? Or am I gay and sleeping with guys to prove that I'm not?\n\nErica Kane:\n\nYou slept with Ryan's brother before you stole the company out from under him?\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo, no, I didn't steal it, I didn't steal it. Adam and J.R. did. Ok, but here's the kicker - Ryan tried to convince me earlier today that he's completely over me for good, which, of course, that can't be. I mean, it's impossible, and we are going to prove that. And you know what's so great about you and I doing this together is that you hate Greenlee just as much as I do, so it's perfect! Plus, mother, you are the queen of creativity. You're so creative. I mean, the truth is i'm running out of ideas, but the two of us putting our heads together could be so amazing!\n\nErica Kane:\n\nKendall, you have to stop. You're talking like a crazy person.\n\nErica Kane:\n\nGetting back at Ryan isn't the answer.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nNo? Ok. All right, fine. Honestly, tell me this... if your father were still alive, standing here right now, what would you do?\n\nErica Kane:\n\nI'd kill him! But you can't equate Ryan with my father.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nOk, well, yes, I agree the crimes were completely different, but the result was pain. Someone hurts you, you make them suffer.\n\nErica Kane:\n\nWell, you wanted me to suffer once. You remember how that turned out.\n\nKendall Hart Cambias:\n\nYes, but I was a kid. Now I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing and I love it. There is nothing more satisfying than paying back hurt for hurt. It's ok, mother, you don't have to worry about me.\n\nErica Kane:\n\nNo, I'm scared for you, Kendall. I'm scared for all of us. I'm scared for you and Bianca and myself.\n\n[Kendall has given Zach a plane ticket to Haiti, where they can get divorced quickly]\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nYou know what? This date's not going to work for me.\n\nKendall Hart Lang Slater:\n\nMake it work.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nLove to, but I can't.\n\nKendall Hart Lang Slater:\n\nWell, what? Is there something going on at the casino? I mean, I can handle it.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nNo, I took the afternoon off.\n\nKendall Hart Lang Slater:\n\nWhat's so important that you can't reschedule it?\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nI'm rearranging my sock drawer.\n\nKendall Hart Lang Slater:\n\nYeah.\n\nZachery Slater:\n\nNo, it's serious business. I mean, I've got the gym socks touching the dress socks. It's a real mess. Anyway, we've got to reschedule this divorce thing.\n\nBabe Carey:\n\nJosh and I, we were just talking about how cool your style is. Your look, it's so far ahead of the curve. It's so -\n\nZarf:\n\nRetro?\n\nJosh Madden:\n\nRetro is where it's at. If you'd look at the papers I gave you, you'll see the key demographics are 16 to 25 year old women, and they love to revive old fashions.\n\nBabe Carey:\n\nWhich is totally true, and the whole early glam look is making a major comeback; New York Dolls, Ziggy Stardust -\n\nZarf:\n\n[standing up from his chair] Thank you. Goodbye.\n\nBabe Carey:\n\nWhy? We just...\n\nZarf:\n\n[about to exit] You've already had 30 seconds; now I'm not only bored, but highly annoyed.\n\nBabe Carey:\n\n[pause]... Mike Patton is not God! Look, I know he's one of your musical idols, and he's talented; no question. But God? Don't you think that diminishes the contributions of the other members of his bands? Faith No More? Mr. Bungle? I dunno, maybe even Tomahawk?\n\nZarf:\n\nYou've been reading my blog.\n\nAdam Chandler:\n\nWhy did you go over to their side? Hmm? When was it you decided that J.R was less important than your big your brother, Jeff, and that science project he calls a son?\n\nTad Martin:\n\nLet's get one thing straight. I love that boy every bit as much as you do, and I am willing to do anything to pull him through this. Because, personally, I don't think Dixie can survive losing another child.\n\nAdam Chandler:\n\nDid you get rid of the damn car?\n\nBarry Shire:\n\nThe car involved in the... accident was crushed, broken into pieces, and sent to six different countries. It's how these things are done...\n\nAdam Chandler:\n\nFirebomb it! Blast it into space! Just make sure that car doesn't come back to haunt my daughter."
