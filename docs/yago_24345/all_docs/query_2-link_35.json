        "text": "“No Great Name on Earth” by Maisie Wiltshire-Gordon\n\nBLAST, TMR’s online-only prose anthology, features prose too vibrant to be confined between the covers of a print journal. In “No Great Name on Earth,” Maisie Wiltshire-Gordon muses on the similarities between her mother and Dorothea Brooke, the main character from George Eliot’s Middlemarch. Apparently without regret, both women give up public pursuits for unsung family lives. Perplexed by this outcome, Wiltshire-Gordon weaves literary criticism with personal memoir to investigate how values and aspirations can shift over time, opening up new and valid avenues for happiness.\n\nNo Great Name on Earth\n\nMaisie Wiltshire-Gordon\n\nThe summer after my freshman year of college, my mother read Middlemarch out loud to us. My older brother was away for a summer research program, but three of us were at home: my twelve-year-old brother, sixteen-year-old sister, and me. It wasn’t unusual for my mother to read books aloud, but we knew that George Eliot’s most famous novel was her favorite. We grew up with the story of my mother’s ultimatum to my dad early in their relationship: if this was going to go anywhere, he’d need to read Middlemarch.\n\nI was working as a camp counselor that summer, and in the afternoons when I came home, or after dinner when it was still light out, we’d sit in somebody’s bedroom and listen to her read. We usually picked my little brother’s room, since it was the biggest and he was the most difficult to corral. I’d sit on the bed, knitting; Virginia would stretch out on the floor; Skip would sprawl next to me or needle Virginia or dig through his closet for forgotten amusements.\n\nIn July, after we’d read about a third of the novel, Virginia left to clear trail in Maine for six weeks. Loath to wait for her return, we decided to record our reading sessions and email them to her so she would be up-to-date when we were together again in August. By the end of the month, we’d sent her seven and a half hours of footage, which she dutifully listened to among the eastern pines.\n\nI forgot about these recordings until ten years later, when I was assigned Middlemarch in a graduate seminar on the realist novel. I loaded them onto my phone and played them on long runs: Eliot’s story and my mother’s commentary and our sporadic interjections made a calming soundtrack along the COVID-quiet streets.\n\n***\n\nIf you ask him now, my brother will insist that he was bored the whole time. This claim is not without evidence: “Skip, don’t throw that, please,” my mother says more than once. At one point I yelp because Skip has poked me with my knitting needle. There’s an altercation involving a blanket, which he wants off and I want on. Still, he wasn’t entirely disengaged. He sounds genuinely upset when Fred Vincy defaults on a loan, forcing the poor Garths to sacrifice their savings to cover for him. Fred had a hundred pounds toward the debt, but he spent it on a horse that has gone lame. “I have tried everything—I really have,” Fred insists.\n\n“No, you didn’t!” Skip interjects. “First of all, just use the hundred pounds to pay the—”\n\n“Sell the flute,” I suggest. “It’s not like he can play it anyway.”\n\n“Yeah, sell your flute! Or beg from your sister!”\n\n“Well, but he enjoys the flute,” my mother says reasonably. “He could get a job, how about that?”\n\nMy mother is not a theatrical person, but she reads with expression. She adopts a monotonous drawl for Casaubon; an earnest, straightforward voice for Dorothea; a light, musical tone for Rosamond. Occasionally the text doesn’t make it obvious who’s speaking, and she mixes up the voices. “Oh, this is Sir James,” she realizes once, after beginning in Celia’s light flutter; she rereads the speech in a more sensible baritone. She offers definitions and editorial commentary as necessary: “When you say ‘friends’ in an English novel, it means ‘close relatives’”; “tatting is like knitting, but tatting is making lace.” When Mr. Brooke announces his run for office, she gives a brief history of the English parliament and the changes happening at the time. We get a description of Dorothea after her honeymoon, and she points out the aesthetic contrast: the Christmas-red of Rome gives way to Lowick’s spare white walls, enclosed and tomblike.\n\n***\n\nThe Fred Vincy–Mary Garth storyline held the most pathos for my brother. But for the novel itself, Dorothea Brooke is more central: Middlemarch begins and ends with a reflection on Dorothea as a modern-day Saint Theresa, an “ardently willing soul” in search of “the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self.” And at the novel’s climax, Dorothea’s choices are the ones the narrator asks us to attend to most closely.\n\nStill, I can understand why Skip wasn’t drawn to her. She’s idealistic and earnest, and at times comes across as holier-than-thou. In the opening scene, Dorothea and her younger sister are looking at some jewelry they’ve recently inherited. Dorothea makes a little speech to Celia about how she doesn’t care for earthly things. But then she sees an emerald ring that she particularly likes and has to do some mental gymnastics to make room for her liking it: “They look like fragments of heaven,” she says. The narrator tells us that “her thought was trying to justify her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.” (Celia, who also likes the emerald ring, is irked.)\n\nBut Dorothea has a commitment to helping others that overshadows these small hypocrisies. And her performative morality diminishes as she finds opportunities to do real good, to make a meaningful difference. She learns that her husband’s aunt was denied any inheritance for marrying a Polish refugee, and she’s willing to sacrifice her own income to make restitution. She sees the poor conditions of the tenant-farmers on her uncle’s land, and she devises a plan to build what’s essentially an affordable housing development. (This was the part of the novel that my father, an urban planner, found most compelling.) Dorothea has principles, and she’s not content for them to remain an abstraction. The narrator tells us she feels a “desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do, what ought she to do?” This is what draws me to her—why I like her, even in spite of her initial Puritanism. She wants to do something that matters. She has education, money, and energy, and she feels a call to make the most of it.\n\n***\n\nMy mother had time to spend afternoons reading to us because they decided my dad would be the one with the career. After all, his job could support the whole family, whereas she was teaching as an adjunct lecturer in anticipation of an academic position once she finished her PhD. She started her dissertation the year before my brother was born, and she kept teaching and writing even once there were two of us. But her progress slowed, and when my sister arrived three years later, they moved to the Chicago suburbs to escape the intensity of the city. My mother packed her dissertation notes into brown boxes that traveled with us to our new house, where they sat in the study unopened and unmissed. She’s still on the rolls at the University of Chicago in a state called “ABD”: all but dissertation.\n\nOf course, her intellect didn’t shrivel once she gave up academic work. Instead of the Tudors and Stuarts, her focus was the Wiltshire-Gordons. “Hyphen. G-O-R, D-O-N,” we’d hear her on the phone, the same patient cadence for every parent-teacher conference she scheduled or doctor’s appointment she confirmed. She found more interesting projects, too. She rewrote the bylaws for the community school we went to when we were little. She managed the household finances: long-term and short-term savings, diversified investments, charitable donations. She organized family trips and redesigned her mother-in-law’s dilapidated kitchen with my uncles serving as the labor.\n\nThe ease with which my mother accomplished these tasks has always made me feel that she could do absolutely anything she wanted to.\n\n“Mom, would you say you’re undaunted?” I asked her once.\n\nShe laughed. “That would not be a word I would use.”\n\n“You never are daunted, though,” I said.\n\n“Well, nothing has ever come along to daunt me.”\n\n***\n\nEarly in the novel, Dorothea marries Edward Casaubon, a man much older than she, whom she’s drawn to for his knowledge and seriousness. She imagines that her marriage will be something like a research assistantship, providing her with the training she needs in order to make a difference in the world. “I don’t feel sure about doing good in any way now,” she reflects. But “I should learn everything then…I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it was possible to lead a grand life.”\n\nIt doesn’t quite turn out this way. Casaubon is insecure about his own work, reluctant to let her help him, and jealous of her efforts to help others. Dorothea embodies every virtue he wants from a wife. But “whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon,” the narrator wryly observes, “was an idea which could hardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy. As if a man could choose not only his wife but his wife’s husband!”\n\nWe must have read this passage soon after my birthday: my mother notes, “Maisie, you are now Dorothea’s age, because she’s nineteen.”\n\n“But I’m not married to Casaubon,” I say.\n\n“No, and you’re not likely to be, either,” she replies.\n\nIt’s not likely, of course, because Casaubon is a fictional character and thus not available to marry a real human; furthermore, he has already chosen Dorothea, to whom he remains married until his death in Chapter 48. In any case, I hope I’d know better than to marry a man thirty years older who gives no sign of emotional readiness for partnership. Having held a research assistantship myself, I am quite satisfied for that experience to remain a professional one.\n\nI can see the appeal for Dorothea, though: the possibility of building a life with an intellectual equal, someone who thinks deeply and shares her principles. How tempting—I know this!—how tempting to ignore practical concerns in favor of the electricity of thinking with someone who knows things I don’t. But my vision is too clear—or maybe it’s that the practical has a way of making itself painful—and I’ve always given it up.\n\n***\n\nThe literary critic Catherine Gallagher argues that Middlemarch is “structured like a triptych”: continually moving between specific description, general type, and back again to the particular case. For example, a description of Mary Garth gives way to what Gallagher calls “the general category of persons by which we are to make sense of [her]”: “If you want to know more particularly how Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded street to-morrow.” But such generality “seems to want experiential grounding,” Gallagher writes, and the narrator soon returns to Mary’s unique traits: her distinctive smile, her singularly sharp tongue. “If you made her angry, she would not raise her voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever tasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget it.”\n\n“Experiential grounding” would be an apt euphemism for the various side plots captured on our recordings. In Chapter 27, my mother worries that the hat I’m knitting will be too small; in Chapter 36, she is proven wrong. Skip starts throwing things in Chapter 23 and never stops. But my favorite moments happen when our dialogue weaves with the story itself. It’s a sign of Eliot’s ear, and her success at creating characters who are at once particular and universal. The matronly Mrs. Garth has two young children who follow her around the house, doing their lessons as she cooks and folds laundry. Her instruction is peppered with various asides: “Those apple peels are for the pigs, Ben.” My mother’s narration features similar interruptions. “Please don’t toss that, honey bun.” (Later, more forcefully: “Skip. Stop throwing that.”)\n\nIn Mrs. Garth’s lesson on the Romans, Ben has trouble remembering yesterday’s facts about Cincinnatus. Moments later, when Fred is confessing his debts to Mrs. Garth, Skip chimes in: “He can sell Diamond, right? Can’t he sell Diamond?”\n\nMy mother patiently reiterates the central plot point from ten minutes earlier. “No, Diamond is lame now.”\n\n“What?! He’s totally lame? I thought he was only a little lame.”\n\n“If a horse is lame, you can’t get much money for it! He had a bad temper, nearly killed a groom, caught his foot in a rope, and lamed himself. That’s the situation. Skip, please don’t do that.”\n\nOn the next day’s recording, Fred is still worrying over his debts when Skip pipes up again. “But Fred has more money now. For selling the—for putting the horse down.”\n\n“He doesn’t have any more money. He gave it to Mrs. Garth.”\n\n“No! Horse flesh! Horse meat!”\n\nMy mother is baffled. “Horse meat? No, they don’t eat horse meat.”\n\n“No, c’mon,” Skip says. “They don’t eat it, but he sold it. That’s what he was doing in the alleys.”\n\n“That’s what he was trying to do; he never managed to do it! The horse was lame—he had the buyer lined up, and the horse went lame!”\n\n“Yes, I know, but now he can sell the horse meat.”\n\n“Yeah, that’s what I’m saying, they don’t eat horse meat. Anyway, we’re trying to hear about Mr. Wrench, who is coming on the morrow…”\n\n(Listening to this recording again, I finally located the source of the misunderstanding. Skip is at least partially vindicated: Fred’s unsuccessful foray into horse-trading is described as “a bad bargain in horse-flesh.”)\n\n***\n\nMy mother and I both feel dissatisfied with the end of Middlemarch. After his death, Casaubon leaves Dorothea an inheritance but restricts it with a petty codicil: if she ever marries Mr. Casaubon’s cousin, she must forfeit the whole sum. Dorothea, who finds she does in fact love Mr. Casaubon’s cousin, gives up the money.\n\nIn the epilogue, we learn that Dorothea devotes herself to her new husband’s career. It’s a good career: he’s working for political changes that increase representation and help the common people. But she doesn’t do any of the things she used to want to do. She doesn’t manage money for public interest projects. She doesn’t design and build an affordable housing development. And—what I find most unsettling—she’s okay with this. She feels that her life is happy, fulfilled, valuable: “Dorothea could have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should give him wifely help.” It seems like the novel wants us to be okay with this, too. Its closing exhortation asks us to see an immense ethical value to her life with her husband and children, even though it’s behind the scenes, even though it’s not public and well-documented like her husband’s work.\n\nBut my mother and I both feel a grief at this. We feel that Dorothea had plans, and we wish she could have executed them. My mother isn’t quite as taken with Will Ladislaw as Dorothea is. “She could have found someone else,” she says.\n\n“But she wanted to marry him,” I say.\n\n“Heaven knows why,” she says.\n\nMy dad, of course, was a sensible choice in every way—and she loved him. So I suppose it’s hard to know what she would have done if he hadn’t been a sensible choice. Probably she wouldn’t have loved him.\n\n***\n\nIn his essay “The Art of Decision-Making,” Joshua Rothman describes a fundamental paradox to the way we approach life-changing choices. We make those choices based on what’s important to us, what we value. But, for big decisions—whether to change jobs, move across the country, have children—the result will change what we value. “Before having children, you may enjoy clubbing, skydiving, and LSD,” Rothman writes. Or “you may simply relish your freedom to do what you want.” After having a child, these things are much harder to come by. Instead, you stay in on the weekends, looking at trucks on the street and reading books about racecars where the couplets don’t quite scan. You’ve given up the things you used to want to do. “And yet,” Rothman writes, “as a parent, you may not miss them. You may actually prefer changing diapers, wrangling onesies.” Parenthood will turn you into the person you feared becoming. But you may find that this is exactly the person you want to be.\n\nHow do you plan for your own future, then? How do you make decisions in pursuit of a sense of fulfillment—a life you find valuable, enjoyable—when the terms of that fulfillment are subject to change based on the very choices you’ve used to pursue it?\n\nEven if my goals go unchanged, my career path is far from assured: I’m working toward a PhD in the humanities, where jobs are notoriously hard to come by. I know that even though I love the work I’m doing, and even if I keep loving it, it might someday be relegated to a hobby—the way it was before grad school, when I would spend my workdays wrangling Microsoft PowerPoint and weekends parsing Levinas and Wittgenstein. I can imagine changing the way I spend my time. But it’s more disconcerting to imagine changing my values: that something could be so important to me and then, simply—stop mattering.\n\n***\n\nMy mother picked me over the English legal system and development of common law under the Stuarts. I don’t mean to make a false dichotomy here: people study English common law and the Stuarts without shortchanging their children. My mother doesn’t frame it this way, either, as if one choice was virtuous and the other morally bankrupt. Still, there are subtle variations in the story depending on when you ask her.\n\n“I didn’t have time for it once Virginia was born,” she says sometimes, as if the dissertation naturally fell by the wayside. But every choice she makes is deliberate, it seems to me; and if something falls by the wayside it’s because she has decided to let it fall by the wayside.\n\n“Well, yes, that’s true,” she says. “We decided that Dad would be the one with the career.”\n\n“Why?” I ask her.\n\n“I wanted to spend more time with all of you,” she usually says.\n\nWe have this conversation a lot. I don’t know why I keep asking her the same questions. Maybe because it seems so out of character, that she would choose not to finish something that mattered to her. But this is what she keeps trying to explain—that it stopped mattering to her. She cared about it, and then she found that she cared about being a parent more. For all her planning ahead, she’s not rigid. You can make a plan and then change it, which is still more useful than not having a plan at all. If she reads a book and discovers it’s repetitive and superficial, she won’t waste her time making it to the last page. (That said, she reads so fast that she might as well finish it.)\n\nSometimes she comes a little closer to what I guess I’m fishing for. “Dad was more established. When we got married, he was almost done with grad school, and by the time I was deciding whether to finish my dissertation, he was making enough to support all of us.”\n\nRegret: I think that’s what I’m trying to hear. A sense that she still feels the PhD was a worthwhile endeavor, that in a different world she would have liked to finish it. And I care about this because I am in the middle of a PhD myself: I am about to start my dissertation, and I find it intimidating, and I worry about not finishing. And so I’m listening for reassurance that this is a worthwhile way to spend my time. It’s the sort of thing children often want from their mothers, I suppose: validation and encouragement. I want to know that she thinks I’m doing something worth doing. I want to know that she’s proud of me.\n\nBut maybe I’m also listening for regret because I know it’s a gift she gave me—that time with her growing up, those afternoons reading Middlemarch. And so I’m alert for any indication that she wishes it had been otherwise. Are you sure it was worth it: I know what it cost you.\n\n***\n\nDorothea is a serious person. “Ardent” is the narrator’s favorite epithet for her. She’s not dour—she laughs along with others’ light-heartedness—but I don’t think she tells a single joke in the whole novel. My mother just manages to surpass her in this regard: she knows one joke, and she will tell it if you accuse her of a lack of levity. (It is not a funny joke. “How do you make a peanut butter sandwich?” it begins—something along those lines—and I don’t remember the ending, except that if you have the gall to ask my mother for a joke you are getting what you deserve.)\n\nBut she laughs at our jokes, my dad and my siblings and me. I suspect she knows we need this from her, because she has a genuine laugh, but also a laugh-of-acknowledgement that recognizes the attempt at humor and responds to the bid for connection: your jokes aren’t funny but I like that you tell them. Her real laugh is a much greater prize; and sometimes when we’re all in the kitchen we’ll each try our various gambits, the repartee for her benefit, to see who can provoke a genuine smile.\n\n“Do you relate to Dorothea?” I asked her once.\n\n“No,” she said.\n\n“But Dorothea has principles, and you have principles,” I said.\n\n“Well, she has principles and ambition. And I just have the principles.”\n\nIn fact, this does sound like Dorothea—Dorothea at the end of the novel, who gave things up but wanted to give them up. She wanted a life with Will Ladislaw more than the life she could have without him. She never did the grand things she planned. But her small acts of selflessness ripple outward, and they turn out to make her own happiness possible, too.\n\nWhat are the big things you could have done? You could have done anything you wanted. You could have had a career like my dad’s, if you had decided you wanted one.\n\n“I did do what I wanted,” she says.\n\n***\n\nThree weeks ago, I took my qualifying exams. I sat across a table from a classicist, a literary theorist, and a philosopher and answered questions for three hours while the sweat soaked my shirt. Then they sent me out of the room while they deliberated. An eternity later, they called me back and declared my competence.\n\nThis means that I am now, like my mother, ABD.\n\n***\n\nThere are so many respects in which I want the same things as my mother, so many ways I want to be like her. I’m a different person, I know that: she’s more analytical; I’m more interested in feelings. She likes logistical projects; I prefer creative ones. But I’m better at my creative projects because she asks me how I plan to manage them. I’m more emotionally stable because I see how placid she is, how calmly she responds to discord, how she’s able to take one issue at a time without letting old hurts spill into new ones. And she’s the one who taught me to care about academic work, she and my dad both: to investigate ideas deeply, to work hard at them. To care about literature.\n\nAnd if I turn out like my mother, how could I be anything but grateful? She’s not perfect, of course she’s not—but if someone said, this is the life you’re going to have, I would count myself lucky beyond belief: not least because it means having four children who love each other. “I did do what I wanted,” she says, and I want her to have done it; I want her to have read Middlemarch to me on summer afternoons.\n\nI don’t know how to want something else for myself, though. I mean, I do—I do want something else for myself. I want to do things that are bigger, that are more public. I’m wary of the impulse toward selflessness, wary of giving in to it, as much as I believe in it—as much as I think it’s one of the most important things about me or about any person.\n\nWith anyone else it would be easier: to say, we’ve made different choices, and that’s fine. But I have tried so hard to make choices the way my mother does, because she is wise and honest and thinks ahead. So I find myself following along with her decisions, wanting so much of what she wanted, and wondering whether I will come to the same moment: ABD and deciding not to finish. She says it doesn’t feel like grief. But we both grieve for Dorothea, for what she didn’t do.\n\n***\n\nDorothea is not my mother’s favorite character. Wry and judicious, Mary Garth holds that honor. Dorothea, by contrast, strikes her as childlike—even at the end of the novel, when she has decided to marry Will and reconciles herself to a life without riches.\n\n“Remember what she tells him?” my mother says. “‘I will learn what everything costs’! Whereas all those other Middlemarchers have had to pay attention to what things cost the whole time.”\n\nI have more sympathy for Dorothea than she does, although I’m also fond of Mary Garth. But my favorite character in the novel is the narrator.\n\n“Is that cheating?” I ask her.\n\n“I guess not,” she allows. “It’s not Eliot herself; it’s a voice she’s created.”\n\nIn case my mother’s opinion holds less weight outside her family, I’ll add that the scholar J. Hillis Miller is also on my side: the narrator asserts a personhood, he argues, through subjective choices about how to tell the story. At the beginning of Chapter 15, the narrator explicitly comments on the task at hand: “I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web.” Miller asks us to “note that personifying ‘I.’ The narrator of Middlemarch can only with difficulty be thought of as a purely neutral or neuter narrative voice.”\n\nMiddlemarch’s narrator is the reason the story is worth reading. She is funny yet insightful, satirical but never belittling. On its own, the plot offers its share of intrigue, but it’s the narrator’s keen eye and turns of phrase that make the novel what it is. Self-important patients like Mr. Trumbull, for instance, are no rarity—but only our narrator finds quite this way of describing it:\n\n“[Mr. Trumbull was] much sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the importance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited to the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to indulge him with a little technical talk.”\n\nMany of the characters in Middlemarch imagine futures for themselves that have little grounding in reality: Fred’s faith in his own good luck; Casaubon’s expectation that marriage will bring rapturous happiness. But the narrator is playfully, thoughtfully attentive to the world as it is. Miller describes the voice as “sympathetic…but also deliciously ironic, mocking, and clairvoyant in his (her, or its) insight into human folly.” She’s an alert observer of the life around her, and the novel invites us to join her in that observation.\n\nIn other words, she is a writer.\n\n***\n\nAll but dissertation: as if my coursework constituted everything, as if the dissertation really were the only thing left.\n\nMaybe I am listening for my mother’s regret because I can’t choose what she did. When she was my age and writing her dissertation, my mother had been married for six years, already had my brother, and was pregnant with me. Whereas the choice I have right now is between writing on Henry James or Virginia Woolf.\n\nFor my mother, “ABD” seems much more accurate. She really did do everything else, everything that mattered to her. And when you have the rest, maybe you don’t need the dissertation after all.\n\n***\n\nThe novel closes by reflecting on Dorothea’s life and impact, with sentences as exquisite as they are famous:\n\n“Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Dorothea’s life does not remain in obscurity. Even as the narrator asks us to recognize the ethical value to acts unseen and unsung, she herself has taken up the task of seeing and singing them. We recognize the exquisiteness of Dorothea’s generosity in part because of the exquisiteness of that sentence—that public, historic sentence. I admire Dorothea’s selflessness. But I also admire the narrator, who found language for it.\n\nThe narrator: who perhaps never faces the forked path that Dorothea does. We don’t know much about her life, after all—whether she’s married; even whether she’s a woman. And we don’t know whom she’s addressing. She could be speaking to three teenagers sprawled in a childhood bedroom, the youngest of whom only pays intermittent attention—or to a committee of literary scholars hanging on her every word. Of course, she does speak to both these groups, and indeed anyone who picks up Middlemarch, whether she can imagine that audience or not: we are all reading the novel that gives words to a hidden life.\n\nDorothea didn’t need the words, though. She never knew her life was narrated, that millions of readers saw her choices and her kindnesses. And as far as I can tell, she didn’t wish for it.\n\nWhen I told my mother I was working on this essay, she said, “No need to write about me!” I’ll clarify, then, that it’s not for her I’m writing it. This is no favor to her, to publicize her quiet life: she studied history but she never needed to be part of it.\n\n“Do you think you’re Dorothea?” I ask again, always circling back to the same questions.\n\nBut she has never been one to indulge a metaphor if she doesn’t have to. “No, I’m just myself,” she says.\n\nAnd I am narrating her, not because she needs her life to be told, but because I would like to tell it. I want to make something that lasts, and this seems worth saving: that things are not so ill with me as they might have been is mostly owing to her.\n\n***\n\nMaisie Wiltshire-Gordon is a 2022-2023 Emerging Critics Fellow with the National Book Critics Circle and a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, studying the relationship between ethics and literary form in twentieth-century novels.

Finding a partner in life is hard enough. Finding someone on Tinder is close to impossible. Mikka Jacobsen’s essay takes us on a series of Tinder dates during which Jacobsen tried to figure out why so many men listed Kurt Vonnegut as a favorite author in their profiles. “Kurt Vonnegut Lives on Tinder” first appeared in print in TMR 43:3 and was published in Modern Fables by Freehand Books (copyright © 2022 by Mikka Jacobsen). You can read an interview with the author here.\n\nKurt Vonnegut Lives on Tinder\n\nBy Mikka Jacobsen\n\nSomeone like Chuck Palahniuk, I’d totally get. You ever read Choke, about the sex addict?” I grip my throat and shudder.\n\n“Or Bukowski.” Luca nods solemnly.\n\n“Yes!” I squeal. “Exactly! Bukowski. That’s good.” We are milling under a weak spring sun outside a breakfast diner, postfeast. I’ve been enthralling Luca by telling her something weird about Tinder. All married friends like a good Tinder story. They find it hilarious and thrilling, the way single friends find the same story humiliating and terrible. On Calgary Tinder—amidst the rifle-shining and gleaming scales of fresh-caught fish, the deer carcasses and camouflage, the “partners in crime” flashing peace signs while proudly “living life to the fullest”—I’ve noticed an odd and surprisingly literary phenomenon. Nearly every second male profile lists Kurt Vonnegut as its favourite writer. I say odd, but I’m not yet sure. I myself have never read any Vonnegut. In fact, the only person I can recall loving him was Trevor S. from grade twelve English, who had a burning passion for Slaughterhouse-Five, spiky blue hair, and a weight problem like my own. We were hardly friends, though I knew no one else as frenzied as I was by books. Perhaps this is why I remember that he loved Slaughterhouse-Five—though it could be the title itself, which is magnificent and lodges in the mind. I don’t recall much else about Trevor, except that he wore the same massive nubby black sweatshirt every day, and I imagined he had a crush on me. Do I need to say he was not popular? Well, neither was I. But in terms of tiers, I fancied mine one above his and thus didn’t wonder much about him.\n\nSo. Has Luca read Kurt? Does she like him? Would she say he’s most suited to chubby blue-haired high school boys? Is he worth the investment?\n\nLuca thinks for a moment. Her face loosens from the Bukowski grimace. A flash of mirrored sunlight flickers over her cheekbones. So there is truth, I think with an admiration surprisingly untouched by envy, to the phrase “pregnant glow.”\n\nShe opens her mouth to say something undoubtedly clever, but before she can get any word out, a man with a pompadour, leather jacket, and aviators thrusts into our conversation, scarf flying as though he’s been blown in by a wind. Heretofore, he’d been leaning against a bicycle rack near the diner door, presumably waiting for his name to be called.\n\n“Slaughterhouse-Five,” he barks.\n\n“Pardon me?” I say, taking a step backward.\n\nLuca has doubled over in laughter.\n\n“Slaughterhouse-Five,” he says with the authority of the pilot he appears to be impersonating, “is the only one you need to read. If you’ve read that one, you’ve read them all.”\n\nHe looks like he’s about to offer more advice, but I grip Luca by the sleeve to tug her away.\n\n“Well,” says Luca, still laughing, “that is the only one I’ve read.”\n\n***\n\nOf course, not everyone lists a favourite author on a dating app. But in the words of a meme attributed to John Waters, “If you go home with somebody and they don’t have books, don’t fuck them.” My Tinder profile is snappy and announces its literary prowess. I list my favourite authors in order—Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson, Maggie Nelson. Hint to the reader: if any date opened conversation by asking my thoughts on “The Glass Essay,” I’d be undressed within the hour. This has never once happened. Not even on a date with a self-published author who promisingly announced his favourite book as Toni Morrison’s Beloved. I germanely asked if he’d ever seen a ghost (my first-date banter is exceptional). He sneered! “You don’t believe in ghosts, do you?” he said. This after it had been made clear, by my mention of the early-aughts afternoon television show Crossing Over with John Edward, that I do and fervently. The self-published author made a horsey sound of displeasure over what he called an evolutionary failure. By that he meant me.\n\n“I thought,” he tsked, “that humans had evolved past the need for banal superstitions.”\n\nThe pervading love of Vonnegut seems intellectually interesting in a way that almost nothing about a dating app is intellectually interesting. So I have decided to read him. If nothing else, it will make for more unforgettable table-side banter. I will read Vonnegut and forthwith date only those who call him their favourite writer. A timely and novel literary experiment. Likely a divining rod for true love.\n\n***\n\nThe first thing you will notice about Vonnegut is that he loves a simple, muscular sentence. Both prose and plot line are as easy to follow as Simon Says, which is perhaps why he is beloved by high school boys. But do not mistake syntactic simplicity for undeveloped craft. The well-chosen verb, the surprising image—both blossom in Vonnegut. Take, for instance, this wet dream of a sentence from Cat’s Cradle: “He exhaled fumes of model airplane cement between lips glistening with albatross fat.” Stop and read it aloud. Such crisp prose! Such imagination! Or consider the snips of dialogue uttered by one of Vonnegut’s more rounded women characters, Bluebeard’s termagant Circe Berman. Said to narrator Rabo Karabekian: “You hate facts like poison.” So sharp! Said of the self-important writer Paul Slazinger: “the spit-filled penny whistle of American literature.” What a zing!\n\nIn keeping with this slick style, Vonnegut more than once pronounces hatred for the semicolon. Reading his 2005 collection of essays, A Man Without a Country, you might cringe over this strange aphorism: “Here is a lesson in creative writing. First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.” (Indeed, the “hermaphrodite” is a common trope for Vonnegut. Bluebeard’s Mussolini-loving Dan Gregory calls Joan of Arc one after Rabo offers her as an example of a woman who has excelled in a field besides domesticity. Rabo can’t think of any others.) You would likewise be hard-pressed to locate more than a handful of compound-complex sentences in any Vonnegut book. The man barely has use for the comma. He does, however, have a great penchant for italics.\n\nIt might be easy to cast Vonnegut as a purveyor of boyish machismo. Chapters are peppered with his hand-lettered bathroom-graffiti-like slogans and cartoonish drawings, such as the asterisk-esque asshole that appears in the prologue of Breakfast of Champions. Vonnegut’s voice is irreverent, antiauthoritarian, the same spirit that animates teenagers immemorial. His mode is satirical, and he possesses a dry wit that, one might argue, rather mercifully sandbags the current deluge of outrage rising all around us. Ours has burgeoned to a self-serious climate where it feels almost impossible—and always crude—to make a joke of any sort (more on this later).\n\nDespite the joys of his irreverence, however, it is all too easy to sink in the morass of sexism, if not outright misogyny, muddying the plots of Vonnegut’s novels. The steady stream of male veteran narrators who lust after and often eventually bed a much younger woman—Cat’s Cradle’s eighteen-year-old Mona Monzano, for example, a denizen of the fictional Caribbean island San Lorenzo, whom the twice-divorced narrator calls a “sublime mongrel Madonna.”\n\nVonnegut’s women characters are often so stock and paper-thin you can’t help but feel a fresh tide of anger when encountering them. This is particularly so in Slaughterhouse-Five. Billy Pilgrim’s mother (whom Billy naturally dislikes) is described as a “standard-issue, brown-haired, white woman with a high-school education.” Billy’s wife, “ugly Valencia,” is rich and fat and perpetually eating candy bars. Billy’s proposal of marriage to Valencia is thought to be “one of the symptoms of his disease.” She dies of overexcitement and poor driving. The pornographic film star Montana Wildhack, a very young and buxom creature entrapped with Billy in an extraterrestrial Tralfamadorian zoo, raises Billy’s child while Billy absents himself to time travel at will. Vonnegut illustrates Montana’s breasts with a crude drawing that features, in between mosquito-coil nipples, a locket containing the lines of the Serenity Prayer—an indication of his twin obsessions: sex with young women and free will. In the prologue, where the Vonnegut-like narrator explains the decades-long gestation of Slaughterhouse-Five, we get ideas such as this on a war buddy’s wife: “Mary O’Hare is a trained nurse, which is a lovely thing for a woman to be.” We see reporters who took the jobs of men during World War II called “beastly girls.” To be fair, Vonnegut, a true misanthrope, seems to dislike men as much as he dislikes women. Or at least the vileness of his male characters suggests this is so.\n\nPossibly the strongest argument for women is made in Bluebeard. As the title suggests, and as all Vonnegut books do, Bluebeard peers behind the doors hiding the bone records of villainy. In Vonnegut’s analog, Bluebeard’s forbidden room becomes veteran Rabo Karabekian’s locked barn. Instead of murdered wives, the barn contains an enormous realist mural depicting World War II atrocities. The mural is titled Now It’s the Women’s Turn. Reading Bluebeard made me think a bit differently, kindlier, about Vonnegut, though it seems inescapably obvious that his prose is of a staunchly different generation. A sort of “dad joke” writer, who frequently uses words from the fatherly lexicon—snooze, old fart. A writer whose aphorisms read like this: “We are here on Earth to fart around. Don’t let anybody tell you any different.” A writer who pens a wisecrack thus: “My wife is by far the oldest person I ever slept with.” I can easily imagine my own father making such quips. And I’m not sure any of this bodes well for my latest man-catching stratagem.\n\nIt seems, too, that the world agrees with the man in the aviators. Slaughterhouse-Five is everywhere considered Vonnegut’s masterpiece. No one I ask can name another of his books, not even Breakfast of Champions, made into a 1999 feature film starring Bruce Willis. “There are novels so potent,” writes James Parker of the Atlantic, “and so perfected in their singularity, that they have the unexpected side effect of permanently knocking out the novelist: Nothing produced afterward comes close.” Parker is waxing rhapsodic about Slaughterhouse’s continued relevance on its fiftieth anniversary in March of 2019. And I must say, at times I too find Slaughterhouse strikingly prescient, at least in its cynicism and apocalyptic visions. Visions induced, like our own, by atomic weaponry and fossil fuels. But even so, even so. Why is the book so popular among the twenty-five- to forty-five-year-old males of my Tinder filter? There are many counterculture writers, writers who celebrate machismo, antiwar and pacifist writers, funny and satirical writers. Why Vonnegut?\n\n***\n\n“So, why Vonnegut?”\n\nI am at an Original Joe’s, where Brad, the first of my Vonnegut dates, suggested we meet. I was initially put off by the Original Joe’s suggestion. If you’ve not had the pleasure, think chain restaurant and let the name guide your imagination. But things are looking up. It turns out they have a taco night.\n\nOn Tinder, Brad’s profile consists of glamour shots and a few requisite action scenes that look to be professionally done—in uniform with a stick on the ice, muscles bulging up a climbing wall. In the few sentences that make for getting to know someone on Tinder, he has written a fairly creepy line: “Let’s be perfect, together, Forever.” Reading this, I was both immediately suspicious and electrified.\n\nBrad shrugs. “I like science fiction,” he says dully. “You know, before I went to medical school, I worked for NASA.”\n\nI spill ground beef into my lap. Brad largely ignores my Vonnegut question so he can continue to talk about his work. Abruptly, he sets down his fork. Brad has a hobby. He’s already told me. The hobby is an endless search for the perfect fork. The perfection has to do with the shape of its tines. So Brad sets down his subpar-tined fork, wipes his puckered pink lips with a napkin, and retrieves his wallet. I admit I am startled by this swift turn of affairs. He removes a five-dollar bill, smooths it with a snap, and lays it on the table. Five dollars, I’m about to inform him, will be a tad shy of the bill that has not yet arrived because I’ve not come close to finishing my taco. But no.\n\n“I used to be an engineer,” he says, tapping the top of the bill.\n\nLettuce hangs from my mouth.\n\n“I helped design the Canadarm.”\n\nI, naturally, have never heard of the Canadarm. It takes a minute before I realize it is featured on our currency. When I brag about this to my friend Eliot later, he scoffs. “What is he, like, seventy?”\n\n“A doctor and an engineer?” I say around the lettuce.\n\n“Yup.” He folds away his wallet.\n\nI’m gulping wine while Brad tries to catch my gaze over the orange flicker of the fake tea light.\n\n“Neither of us,” he announces, “has any time to waste. So let’s not beat around the bush.” Brad has blinding, denture-like teeth. He is wearing a suit jacket. I am wearing purple lipstick and a halter top.\n\nMy lips curl in a lewd smile. “That’s a funny phrase, if you think about it. The other day, a friend told me a story about how he was facilitating some government training session and inadvertently said ‘bent over a barrel.’ He’s worried he might be fired!”\n\n“I have five questions,” says Brad.\n\n“Oh!” I think Brad is proposing a game, or that we are meant to be having a nice time.\n\nOne: Have you ever been married?\n\nTwo: Do you have any children?\n\nThree: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime?\n\nFour: Do you have any addictions?\n\nHe wags a finger at me. “And that includes smoking.”\n\n“Five,” he concludes: “Is there anything you want to tell me before this goes any further?”\n\nI am so flabbergasted I actually respond to this blaze of rifle fire. Brad, blowing on the barrel and holstering his gun, informs me that he approves. I do not have time to wonder whether equating childbearing with crime is appalling or pleasing.\n\n“Now,” he says, “I’m sure you’re wondering the same about me.”\n\n“No, actually. I was wondering what you liked about Kurt Vonnegu—”\n\nThat wagging finger again. “I’ll play fair.” He steadies his gaze and without pause shoots off his five-point response.\n\n“And five,” he says, out of breath and winking. “I’ve already confessed my fork fetish.”\n\n“Five, five,” I am thinking. “Like, as in Slaughterhouse?”\n\n“You’re sure you don’t smoke?” he asks as we move through the door and part ways.\n\nSince Brad never told me, I’m left to my own devices to guess what he likes about Vonnegut. Perhaps, I think with self-satisfied glee, he enjoys how the women in Slaughterhouse are mere props. Perhaps he cackles over the only woman mentioned in the Dresden plot, the one in a photograph attempting to copulate with a horse—a slice of historical pornography carried by the masochistic soldier Roland Weary. Perhaps, due to his affiliation with NASA and the robotics industry, Brad simply admires the science-fictional elements—Vonnegut’s Tralfamadorians and their fourth-dimensional concept of time, where everything that has ever happened and will ever happen occurs simultaneously and where unpleasant states, such as death, are just one moment of many that can be visited at will. But even the Tralfamadorians are implicated in the seedy and the pornographic. They imprison Billy Pilgrim and Montana Wildhack naked in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore so Tralfamadorians may watch the humans mate.\n\n“So far, Kurt, you have not fared well,” I’m thinking as I beg a cigarette from a teenager at a bus stop. I bow, and she cups a lighter about my mouth. “It may as well be Bukowski or Palahniuk,” I mutter.\n\nUnder our cloud of smoke, the teenager nods in sympathy.\n\n***\n\nYears ago, I worked at a not-for-profit resource centre run by and for people with disabilities. I found the job difficult. My English degree, I felt, had not equipped me for the complexity. I managed the centre’s volunteer program, and this was often humiliating for all—a twenty-three-year-old in a velvet minidress commandeering a group of disenfranchised middle-aged adults. I was, according to my own boss, meant to boss these volunteers around. “Our mandate is to provide workplace skills. Office skills,” she said, “so that a volunteer might get a paying job someday. You have to impose structure. Office-like expectations.”\n\nCan you imagine? I’d have to reprimand a former nurse with fibromyalgia for a too-long break or command a fifty-five-year-old in a wheelchair to fold a stack of brochures all afternoon or shame Steve for looking at Facebook while I myself spent the day looking at Facebook. I was asked to tell Jordan, my favourite volunteer, to stop answering the phone after another staff member complained that his voice was unintelligible. Our main office task was awarding the decals that allowed you to park in accessible stalls.\n\nIf you’ve ever held a job like this, where you were in charge of adults who are treated like children, you might understand the surge of ugly pity I am hoping to hide as I smile at Lance—my second Vonnegut date—with his stringy corn-coloured hair and moon face. He has a graying tooth and dust of sugar on his chin from a half-eaten donut. His breath smells of sour coffee. I have the embarrassing sense of being in charge on an outing with the resource centre’s volunteers.\n\n“I haven’t sat across from a pretty girl for a long time,” he is saying, rubbing a shaking hand over the sugar, his whiskers. “It’s nice.”\n\nI feel like the Tralfamadorian who compares a moment in time to a bug trapped in amber.\n\nA wistful look breaks over Lance, a look of such terrifying longing that for a moment I wonder if he has just been released from prison. The first much-whispered-about woman I ever knew to online date—back in the early aughts, in the days of Plenty of Fish—when this fallen woman brought her new boyfriend to a barbecue, my friend Lauren whispered to me that he was a killer. He’d been convicted of murder! Twice! Once at his own brother’s wedding! No one was to talk about it. “Since it might set him off,” Lauren said.\n\nI in turn whispered this to my then boyfriend, Jeffrey Makin. Jeffrey liked Lucky Lager and nicknames. He called himself, after he’d downed a few Luckys, “Makinmania.” He called me “Slug,” for reasons to do with my pace—not, he said, my physique. He called my tiny, beautiful, blonde best friend Alice, who is brash and a breaker of things and has a voice like a linebacker, “Killer.” During the barbeque, Makinmania inevitably emerged. And he kept calling out to Alice, loudly, across our backyard.\n\n“Hey, Killer!” he yelled as I hissed for him to pipe down, darting my eyes at the online boyfriend, “grab me another Lucky.”\n\n“Hey, Killer,” Makinmania shouted, “how ’bout some ketchup?”\n\nLance doesn’t have the look of a criminal. He does have the aura of someone used to being treated as though he doesn’t possess rights or dignity. It turns out Lance has for some time been living in a group home for men with schizophrenia.\n\nI take this news with a blink and ask about Kurt, a nice neutral subject. All the while I remember showing Lance’s Tinder profile to Alice. It had looked fine to me: no guns, no carcasses, no costumes, no wraparound sunglasses.\n\nTo which she replied, “Mikka, no.” She found his photos menacing.\n\nI said rather defensively, “I like to give people a chance.” This, it now appears, is a bald-faced lie.\n\nLance doesn’t want to talk about Vonnegut. Whom he really wants to talk about is David Foster Wallace. When he finds out I’ve just finished Infinite Jest, he is ecstatic. “The footnotes,” he is saying, “they’re meant to be structured like a tennis match. Do you get it? Do you? Like, back and forth, back and forth. Your eye becomes the ball.”\n\n“What’s your favourite Vonnegut book?” I say, trying to abate the climbing DFW exuberance.\n\n“No,” he shakes his head. “I’m talking about Wallace.” He sounds almost scornful over my stupidity.\n\n“Looks like my kombucha is all done.” I feel a tremor of guilt as I hurry myself away from him, glancing over my shoulder to ensure he’s not attempting to follow and calling out a false promise that we might do this again sometime.\n\nHis face looks dull in the sunshine.\n\nI both wish and do not wish that Lance and I had talked about Vonnegut. I would argue that much of Slaughterhouse-Five’s originality and profundity is found in Billy Pilgrim’s own mental illness, PTSD. The abrupt jumps through narrative time—a veterans’ hospital in New York state, the slaughterhouse in Dresden where he and fellow prisoners of war survive its fire-bombing, a scene from Billy’s wedding, the ruins of a plane crash—this narrative time travel is either Billy experiencing the true nature of time, as shown to him when he was abducted by the Tralfamadorians, or a symptom of PTSD. Vonnegut’s form—the shortspliced scene, the quick dive through decades—fuses to the content and acts as both brilliant plot device and heartrending metaphor. What might it be like to read Slaughterhouse with a brain full of what Vonnegut calls “bad chemicals”? How would it feel to follow a character who believes wholeheartedly in his own delusions, particularly when Vonnegut leaves space for an alternate reading, where Billy Pilgrim’s ability to “come unstuck in time” is offered as not merely psychosis but semi-plausible reality?\n\n***\n\nThe comedian Kabir and I are in a wooded tavern. I am waiting for him to say something funny.\n\n“That’s the thing,” he says, “everyone always expects a comedian to be funny.”\n\n“Exactly!” I say.\n\n“We spend time crafting jokes, we’re hilarious onstage. But in regular conversation? No.”\n\nLet me tell you, this is a shock. I almost think he is wisecracking.\n\n“Vonnegut?” He looks at me like I’ve also said something deeply unfunny. “Yeah, I read Slaughterhouse-Five in high school.”\n\nThat’s it. He moves on, telling me about touring schedules, his new routine. I’m so hardwired to listen to a man’s voice that I attend, like a cocked-head spaniel, to descriptions of comedy clubs in Grande Prairie and hecklers in Fort Mac, to confessions of pennilessness, to a long tale on how a comedian gets his start. Like a rapt audience, I listen and listen without being once asked a question myself.\n\nIt is only later, when I take stock of the date, that I fantasize about a more interesting conversation, where Kabir offers erudite intellectualisms about literature. What truly elevates Slaughterhouse-Five, he is saying in my mind, is satire. If satire’s mode is one of derision, it seems to follow that the satirist is a cynic and a misanthrope. Undoubtedly the most famous British satirist, Jonathan Swift, was a human hater if there ever was one.\n\nYes, Kabir, I am thinking, I completely agree.\n\n“Humanity deserved to die horribly,” Vonnegut’s recurring science-fiction writer character, Kilgore Trout, says in Breakfast of Champions, “since it had behaved so cruelly and wastefully on a planet so sweet.” Maybe this is tongue-in-cheek? But keep in mind that Kilgore Trout is often thought to be a stand-in for Vonnegut. Reading A Man Without a Country, essays written in the era of Bush Jr. and near the end of Vonnegut’s life, it is hard not to come away infected with the bitterness that seems to have eaten through the essayist himself. He compares Americans to Nazis. He suggests that new strains of disease, such as AIDS, are signs of the earth trying to rid itself of human life. He cites The Jerry Springer Show and announces, “Like my distinct betters Einstein and Twain, I now give up on people, too.” The final piece in the collection is a poem simply titled “Requiem.” Its last lament is spoken by the Grand Canyon: “‘It is done.’ / People did not like it here.” A sentiment that perhaps, in the end, reveals Vonnegut’s true twin obsessions: satirical biblical exegesis and human extinction.\n\nSurprisingly, “Requiem” isn’t the bleakest moment in a very bleak book. This comes when Vonnegut renounces his own comic voice. He writes, “Humor is a way of holding off how awful life can be, to protect yourself. Finally, you get just too tired, and the news is too awful, and humor doesn’t work anymore.” On admitting that he is no longer funny, Vonnegut writes, “There may have been so many shocks and disappointments that the defense of humor no longer works.” Note the passive construction here, the tentative maybe of the assertion—not even the writer himself knows why. It is heartbreaking that Vonnegut, so hotly funny in Slaughterhouse-Five, has given up. If the satirist’s desire is to exaggerate folly in order to ameliorate it and if Vonnegut’s focus across his oeuvre is to lampoon the stupidity and atrocity of war, then it is surely no surprise that he finds himself unable to muster even a derisive laugh. And this was in the years of George W. Bush. What would Vonnegut think if he were living today?\n\nTo be honest, Kabir, I’m not always sold on satire. Maybe because I was bullied so much as a child. In some ways, it’s like the worst species of hipsterism. A mocking irony that only others in the know understand. If you are smart enough to be in on the joke, the humour works caustically. But if you take it in earnest? Your mustache suddenly feels creepy.\n\nI love old country music, and I own a copy of Merle Haggard’s classic album Okie from Muskogee. The lines of its title song are what, to my mind, Trump means by MAGA. Okies from Muskogee don’t smoke marijuana or take LSD. They don’t do things like burn their draft cards on Main Street, and they still wear “manly footwear,” like football, and respect authority figures. I have never played this record in company, as my love of it fills me with shame. Recently, I was listening to Cocaine and Rhinestones, a podcast about the history of twentieth-century country music. The host, Tyler Mahan Coe, devotes a whole episode to this song. It is, he argues, satire. The first time Merle played it live, a group of Green Berets rushed the stage. Merle thought they were going to attack. But the Green Berets loved it; they wanted Merle to play the song again. Coe suggests that after the very people Merle was making fun of came to love the song, he couldn’t then say, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. I’m making fun of you.” The whole song is a joke! When I told this to a country singer friend of mine, he seemed shocked that I hadn’t known this, or figured it out myself.\n\nI am now free to love Merle Haggard openly, but understanding his mockery feels both exhilarating and bleak. I do love a good joke, but not one made at my expense. And for the most part, I dislike irony in others, preferring to its distancing intellectualism the vulnerability required of earnestness. And so much of humour, so much of Vonnegut’s humour particularly, relies precisely on irony. It’s what makes his work so hard to critique. If I balk at his portrayal of women, for instance, or how many of his male protagonists are middle-aged men sleeping with near teenagers, or a flimsiness of characterization, or his essay in A Man Without a Country where he opens with the line “Let’s talk about women” and proceeds to describe our central ailment as an addiction to talking, then maybe I’m just not getting it. Maybe Vonnegut is mocking the very types of people who do and say and believe these things. And if I take any of it at face value, I’m missing the point entirely. I’m a uniformed private out there in the crowd, fevered with adoration and singing along with Merle about Old Glory and “living right and being free.” My lighter ablaze and a tear in my eye.\n\nAre we becoming a culture of bad readers, a stunned species that has no use for context or careful and slow consideration? My gut reactions to Vonnegut—my insistent feminism, for instance—feel dangerously like a symptom of the plague of outrage leaping its way through the public forum. It seems that nobody, anymore, has a sense of humour. Perhaps, given the way things are, we simply can’t. Yet I worry about a whole culture of Bush-era Vonneguts, a world where people can no longer laugh, even derisively. But then, I worry too about the kinds of things defended by can’t-take-a-joke retorts. Think of the storm that raged in the comedy world about whether male comedians ought to tell rape jokes (their answer, the men’s, was resoundingly yes). Or the endless and tiresome debates about “political correctness.” I like to think of myself as a funny person, even a funny writer. I, like Vonnegut of old, use humour as a way to skirt ruin. But as I read Vonnegut, I feel an oddly split consciousness. Part of me is appalled, and part of me can’t tell if that was always and in each instance the point. And, to be honest, it troubles me that he remains so popular, so revered. In another 2019 golden-anniversary Slaughterhouse commemoration, Kevin Powers of the New York Times calls Vonnegut a writer of “unmatched moral clarity,” a writer who “could cut through cant and sophistry and dissembling to expose our collective self-deceptions for what they are.” It’s hard not to feel a bit disappointed by all this. How can someone of such gender-biased prose continue to be lauded as a writer of unparalleled conscience?\n\nI hadn’t even remembered the dick jokes in Slaughterhouse-Five when I was out with the comedian, likely because Kabir was so insultingly unfunny. But they’re all I can think about now as I sit rigidly on a blanket in Riley Park with Vlad. It must be a nervous reflex. I ruefully must tell you that Vlad has turned up looking nothing like his Tinder profile. He has wraparound sunglasses, a sharp and alien-looking Adam’s apple, and an Eastern European accent.\n\nThe lack of resemblance, he assures me, is not what I’m thinking. He, Vlad, is a psychotherapist. One so irresistible a client became enamoured. When he told her nothing must happen between them, she created a fake (!) Tinder profile and lured him into a drawn-out online romance. Until Vlad discovered the truth and almost died over the ethical implications. This is the reason for the fake photographs.\n\n“The lengths people will go,” he says.\n\nI suspect he’s married.\n\nForever careful to protect a man’s feelings, I decide to stay for a polite-but-not-misleading amount of time. I’m still curious about Vonnegut, though none of my dates seems interested in talking about him. I’d thought I was on to something, an uncovered coincidence that might, if properly pursued, lead to love. Perhaps I don’t need to tell you that I’m partial to this kind of fatalistic thinking, synchronicity and signs in the firmament. But I now wonder if favouring Vonnegut isn’t just more empty social-media signaling. A counterculture writer, somewhat literary, someone you remember reading once in high school and whose hipness, by your naming, might rub off on you. Rub off! Plus, all those dick jokes! Slaughterhouse-Five literally opens with a man-from-Nantucket-style limerick and contains, I am afraid to say, the declaration that, Billy Pilgrim “had a tremendous wang.”\n\nVlad doesn’t mention the dick jokes. All he wants to talk about is Anaïs Nin.\n\nSadly, by this point, I can’t rise to the occasion.\n\n***\n\nIf anyone ever asks, what I think is most profound in Vonnegut is the struggle to come to terms with the notion of free will. Of all the visited planets in the universe, say the Tralfamadorians, “Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.” There’s no such thing, they tell Billy Pilgrim. Everything that has ever happened and will ever happen is happening simultaneously. In fact, they know how the universe ends. The Tralfamadorians are testing a new fuel for flying saucers, a “Tralfamadorian test pilot presses a starter button, and the whole Universe disappears.” Billy asks why, if they know this, the Tralfamadorians don’t stop the test pilot from button-pressing. “He has always pressed it,” they say, “and he always will.” A lurid analogy indeed in the Cold War era of Slaughterhouse-Five. After events both banal and genocidal, the narrator includes the phrase “So it goes,” the phrase being the existential motto of Tralfamadore. Might this explain—maybe at a subconscious level, maybe the psychotherapist could have told me—why Calgary Tinder so likes Vonnegut? Because, really, Tinder is a galaxy of infinite choice in the realm where we’ve been so often sold the idea of destiny. And who, when plucked up by its hormonal squalls, doesn’t believe that love is somehow ordained? And this feeling! Isn’t it one that makes life, for all its terrible weather, worth living?\n\nThe element of chance that so often attends the lore of soulmates can lend one a sense of complicity in the universe: if I hadn’t gone to the party, if she hadn’t missed her train. But this very element appears vapid in the face of technology like Tinder. How terribly sad. I want to believe, more than anything, in fate. Vonnegut does too, I think. Yet he equally despises those who would surrender free will. Isn’t this desire an ultimately childish wish to never be held to account? Which is why Tralfamadorian explanations of time and fate are so appealing. But I am an admitted believer in ghosts and psychics, John Edwards and palm readers. I want to find order in a mostly awful world. I want, like a child, to be assured that my life will be beautiful—a beauty that is always in the future, written but not held in my palm. I think it has something to do with hope. As Vonnegut says of this need in A Man Without a Country: “Crop failures, plagues, eruptions of volcanoes, babies being born dead—the guessers often gave us the illusion that bad luck and good luck were understandable and could somehow be dealt with intelligently and effectively. Without that illusion, we all might have surrendered long ago.” Surrendered, as Vonnegut himself seems to have done.\n\nStill, he continued to write.\n\nTechnological progress, another target of Vonnegut ridicule, steals from romantic myth that hopeful, fatalistic element and has made a cynic out of me. I don’t know if so much choice, so much free will, is good for us. At the same time, without it, as Vonnegut’s novels so smartly suggest, no one is responsible for anything. That dick pic has always arrived, and it always will.\n\nSo it goes.\n\n***\n\nMikka Jacobsen is a writer from Calgary.

In her story “The Witches of Detroit” Maureen Aitken examines family tragedy and its aftermath from the perspective of two middle-school girls who form an unexpected bond.\n\nThe Witches of Detroit\n\nby Maureen Aitken\n\nWhen my mother ran out of excuses to keep me home from school—a cold, pneumonia, the flu—the principal told her I had to return or repeat the sixth grade. By then, two weeks of mourning had turned to three. By then, fall had slipped away, and the year’s first snowfall had grayed in the streets and formed an ice shell over the lawns.\n\n“Fine,” my mother told the principal. “But if my daughter dies of respiratory failure, I’ll blame you.”\n\nThat first morning at school, when the bell rang for classes, the tan-tiled halls closed in so small, and the floor tilted so slightly. People I knew, Janice and Matt, talked to other people with dampened voices, as if their fists were cupped together around their mouths.\n\nI sat in the same wood chair as before, saw Mr. Armstrong with his pocket protector, then walked the same Santa Maria Street toward home. One family didn’t shovel their sidewalks, so the snow turned to ice. I slipped, landing on my leg, then my hand, until all of me fell.\n\nAbove me, these huge tree limbs arced, bare, with fine younger limbs hanging in clusters. I’d never noticed how the branches reached above the sidewalk and over the street. A cardinal on a far limb flew away. The cold on my back, the sky above, and something about the utter collapse relaxed me. Someone walked around me.\n\nThe ice numbed the back of my head. I took a deep breath in, sensing where the cold met my lungs, where the chill seized my throat. When the beep of hospital monitors erupted in my brain, it froze instantly, hung there, arrested. My mother crying, my father’s face, my sadness. The memories barely whispered before they iced in mid-movement, filling me with such space, such release. I couldn’t think.\n\nMore people passed. Someone asked, “Walk much?” A boy chuckled at a high pitch, like a creaky seesaw. The numbness came as a relief. Mother Nature would ease my pain. I was about to close my eyes. More than that. Since he’d left, I saw this hole ripped in the day. Maybe it had been there all along. It could take anything. People. Cars. Mom. Me. It scared me, to feel what was there one day, gone the next. But lying on the ground, for the first time, I thought, I give up being scared of you.\n\nThen from above, hair and a face started to arc over my sky like a moon. It took me a second to realize it was Lauren, a girl in the grade above me, who said, “I heard your dad died.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said.\n\nShe nodded. “I lost mine, too.”\n\nLauren reached her hand out. I hesitated. Lauren was a year ahead of me, but she seemed twenty years older. She stood tall with big boobs and a little pudge, and she passed the halls without talking to anyone in particular, so people thought she was either cool or crazy. The school was a mix of races, with a few Filipino and Latina students. But Lauren? They couldn’t figure her out. When someone asked, she’d tell them to fuck off. People steered clear of her, and the way she leaned over me, she could have thought like a kid, and easily spit on me. But she didn’t. So I grabbed on.\n\nWe walked past the alley, the house with the red fence and the dog that long ago pushed his head through a screen, which flapped in the wind as we passed. The dog inside stared at us like we were steak on stilts, his nostrils smearing the window, his barks muffled by the glass.\n\nPeople waved to Lauren as she talked about biology class and how we learned everything from the wolves. When they were sick, they went alone to die, she said, because they didn’t want to infect anyone or slow the pack down.\n\nThe rip in the sky, still there, felt less scary. “I like the writing classes, and literature. I just read A Catcher in the Rye.”\n\n“Well, I’ve read stuff too,” Lauren said.\n\n“Like what?”\n\n“Horror,” Lauren said. “I’m a big fan of guts.”\n\nA paper turkey hung from a window of Jill Robinson’s old house. Jill and her family had moved away, like so many, in the summer, when few noticed. It was the time of Jimmy Carter, white flight, and stagnation, at least here. Every summer people moved away, with their absence not felt until fall. Jill Robinson’s old house now had another family there. The people next door had moved to California.\n\nThe trees breathed. It was weird, to feel their inhales for the first time. “All of the trees,” I said. “They sense us.”\n\n“Maybe you hit your head,” Lauren said. “I heard if you fall asleep, you might die.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nThe street I’d known my entire life stretched out before us, the brick houses, slumping from neglect, some windows covered with sheets, the early Christmas lights, the Thanksgiving paper turkeys of brown, yellow, and orange.\n\nAt my house, with the missing bricks, we stood. I want to say I was sorry for her loss. Lauren had just started at the school, so I hadn’t known she’d lost her father.\n\nBut Lauren interrupted me. “If you trip again, don’t stay down.”\n\n“It felt good,” I said. Mr. Johnson drove by with his shepherd running behind the car, in his version of walking his dog.\n\nLauren folded her arms and shook her head. “You have to be strong. Otherwise, life’ll crush you.”\n\nMr. Johnson turned left. “It already has.”\n\nLauren’s breath plumed out in fogs into the cold and then gone. “Cool.” She turned and walked toward home without a goodbye and without looking back.\n\n***\n\nOn Friday, I was walking with my friend Janice when Lauren stopped me in the hall and passed me a book. “Okay, read this. You’ll see.”\n\nAfter Lauren walked away, Janice said, “She’s so cool.”\n\nThe book was Helter Skelter, about the Manson murders. At home, I made Mom a chicken sandwich and did my homework at the dining room table so she wouldn’t feel alone. For two hours, she sat on that couch under the living room window, gazing into some unknown land. It was her version of being in the cold, so I got it. I made her coffee. When I brought it to her and she took a sip, she choked.\n\n“Well, that should wake me up,” she said. She took another sip. I watched her from the dining room table, and when my homework was done, I snuggled up next to her and thought of Lauren and her guts obsession and fell asleep.\n\nI finished Helter Skelter by Sunday morning. I wanted to know if Lauren read books like this because of her father. Maybe he’d died in some brutal way. Or was it a way of fighting off the pain? Mom hadn’t gone to church since the funeral. I thought to walk the book over to Lauren’s house, even though I wasn’t completely sure where she lived.\n\n“I’ll be right back,” I said.\n\n“Where’re you going?” Mom asked. She reached her hand out to me.\n\n“Just down the street to return this book,” I said. “I don’t have to go.”\n\n“You go,” she said. “I’ll make lunch. We’ll eat in an hour.”\n\n“Sure,” I said. “I’ll be right back.”\n\nFour blocks over, past the barking Rottweilers, an abandoned house, and the one of stone and brick with the oboe player inside—I searched out the block where I’d seen Lauren raking leaves. The cold breeze and the snow felt crisp. A passing car with two parents and two kids in back made my heart hurt. I had to stop. I saw, then, a small rock above the snow, as if it were trying to run away. I put it in my pocket and walked slowly, searching for signs.\n\nI heard yelling at one house and then the word “Lauren.” I stood in front of the house, trying to tell if the yelling had laughter in it or anger. Someone moved upstairs, and I thought to keep walking when Lauren opened the front door and said, “You finish it?”\n\nShe waved for me to come in, even though a woman’s yelling had grown stronger.\n\nLauren walked straight upstairs, and I followed. In the hallway was a picture of Mrs. Delaney, Lauren as a baby, and, apparently, Mr. Delaney. Mrs. Delaney was black. Mr. Delaney was white. But the weird thing was their faces. They didn’t match. Mrs. Delaney had saucer eyes, like Gladys Knight. Kind eyes. Mr. Delaney’s whole face was pinched, with little eyes and a mouth without lips, like a rat.\n\nThe yelling got louder. A slam of the phone.\n\n“Is everything, like, okay?”\n\n“Oh, that’s my Aunt Gloria with my mom.”\n\nWe were upstairs and in her room before she said, “Aunt Gloria’s a lawyer. She represents my mom.”\n\n“For what?” I said. “Never mind. That was dumb.”\n\n“Ask all you want,” Lauren said and sat down in the window box. “My stupid father cheated on my mom. Now they’re divorcing or trying to. Aunt Gloria said Mom will take him for everything.”\n\nI froze. “What? I thought your father was dead.”\n\nLauren sprayed some Love’s Baby Soft on and sniffed her wrist. “Dead to me.”\n\nShe straightened her back. “Aunt Gloria found out the truth. He had an affair with someone five years older than me. Got her pregnant, too. That’s grounds.”\n\nMy brain tried to fix Lauren’s story, got stuck.\n\n“He’s dead to me, too, and I haven’t even met him.”\n\nI thought changing the conversation might help, so I said Helter Skelter was so scary, especially the parts about how crazy Charlie Manson controlled women.\n\n“Yeah, and then they tried to take the baby out of Tate’s body.”\n\nI put my hands over my ears. “Stop. Gross.”\n\nLauren nodded. “I told you I like guts. How sick or high do you have to be to do that? I’m supposed to be a doctor. So I should know. There goes Aunt Gloria.”\n\nA woman in a blue dress walked out to her car. A quiet came over the house, and soon a gentle knock at the door.\n\n“Lauren? Aunt Gloria said goodbye.”\n\nLauren’s mom opened the door slowly and then snuck into the room. She was tall, elegant, and thin in her crocheted short dress of bright colors, her hair pulled back in a bun.\n\n“Mom this is Mary,” Lauren said. “Her dad just died.”\n\nMrs. Delaney sat up. “Oh, I am so sorry, Sweetie. I am so, so sorry.”\n\nI had to think fast not to burst out into tears. “Lauren was just saying she’s going to be a doctor.”\n\nMrs. Delaney smiled. “Yes, like her grandfather. What in God’s name are you reading?”\n\n“Reading about the Tate murders,” Lauren said. “It has anatomy in it.”\n\nMrs. Delaney shook her head slowly, turned, and walked out without saying a word. Lauren smiled. “What’s—” I started to say but Lauren put her finger to her lips. She leaned forward, waiting for something.\n\nMrs. Delaney came back with five dollars. “Go buy some smart books. And I want to see what you buy. No horror or astrology, you hear me?”\n\nWe both said, “Yes. Ma’am” together. She restrained a smile and went to make more phone calls. Lauren and I walked to my house. When I unlocked the door, Mom was happy to see me, but then her face fell a little to see Lauren. I knew that face, the one where it was just us, and now others would arrive back into our lives.\n\n“Mom, this is Lauren, from school.”\n\n“Oh, hello,” she said, brightening again. We split my sandwich and convinced my mom to drive us up to the Library Bookstore, with used, cheaper books we could afford. A droop in her face, one of such sadness, came over her. “I guess it’s time to move on, right?”\n\nIt didn’t dawn on me that this was the first time she’d left the house in three weeks. She moved as though ghosts surrounded her. Lauren sensed this, I think, because when Mom stopped to let us out, Lauren said, “We all need to find something good.”\n\nThe small bookstore had a cooking section, and my mom stayed there, looking at the jackets with faint interest. I went over to the literature section and found a cheap Pride and Prejudice. I’d heard of it but didn’t understand the fuss over the first pages.\n\n“What’s some dead British woman going to show us?” Lauren said.\n\nI put it back.\n\nWe found two books that Lauren’s mother would like: me The Grapes of Wrath and Lauren found The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\n\nWe wandered around until we found a display table called “Witches and Warlocks,” with two shelves underneath. “The Book of Spells,” Lauren read. “Sweet.” We studied the back jackets as if they mattered.\n\nWe found Witchcraft. We did the math and bought three more books, but we were still twenty cents short.\n\n“I’ll give it to you,” the owner said. “Good to see girls reading something valuable.”\n\n“Yeah, I hear Steinbeck is great.”\n\nThe bookstore owner was framed by First Editions, the valuable stuff, on display at the center, and stacks running two feet over her head.\n\n“No, dear. The witchcraft books. Changed. My. Life. But don’t tell people.”\n\n“Why not?” I asked.\n\nShe looked at me like I was some kind of new dumbass.\n\n“People fear witches. Besides, we just find each other.”\n\n“Cool,” I said.\n\nMom came back from the cookbook section with one slim book on soups and studied our selections. “This is a bizarre fixation.” She pointed to our books. As we walked out into the cold air she said, “You girls happy?”\n\n“Yes,” we said in unison. “Thank you.” She didn’t talk about the books again. We walked over to the cake shop, and Mom bought four items to go, chocolate cupcakes for us, a dark chocolate one for Mom, and a carrot-cake muffin. It was Dad’s favorite. I held my breath when I saw it.\n\nIn the middle of the bakery, she looked down at her selections and froze, knew just then that there was no husband at home waiting for this. Not only did she have to see her home again without him; she would have to see his absence anew at every errand and event until, years later, he would be rooted out of her life.\n\nI grabbed the food. “Good idea,” I said. “We’ll set it at his place at the table for Dad and eat it in his honor.”\n\nMy mother nodded. “Yes, we’ll do that.”\n\nLauren and I ate the cupcakes in the back seat, stamping the pages of our books with icing fingerprints, our teeth stained with clumps of chocolate.\n\nThe next day Lauren rifled through the book of spells and found four incantations. I wanted to talk to my dead father, and Lauren wanted her father to move away; Lauren wanted a protection spell for her mother; then I wanted one for my mother. We wrote them down on the back of a receipt.\n\n“But first we need to start with a test spell, something small,” Lauren said.\n\n“A dollar.”\n\n“That’ll work.”\n\nWe sat facing the windows and said, “Great Mother, we offer these spells, in your honor.”\n\nWe read the spells several times, with the list of all four wishes and the dollar test.\n\n“Now let’s burn the list,” Lauren said. She went to grab it.\n\n“No way. We’re experimenting. We need to test the outcomes.”\n\nWe didn’t wait. My mom found us lifting up the couch cushions, pulling out lint balls, a tie, and change. She gave us a bag. “Put the lint in here.”\n\nWe found $1.23 in change in the couch and stared at each other, wide-eyed. “It works,” Lauren said.\n\nChristmas was in a week. For Christmas we bought each other rabbits’ feet, mine in blue and Lauren picked green.\n\nChristmas arrived. Mom and I had gone to buy a tree, but that had been Dad’s job, so we bought one too late, and too small. We had four gifts, which we’d wrapped together, so the surprise was gone. Some aunts and a few cousins would come over today at three. But I made a fire and we sat there, Mom and me, in the early morning, listening to the fire crackle, watching the wood burn hard and full.\n\n“Thank you,” I said. “For the gifts.”\n\nMom nudged me. “This is just one of those holidays we get through.”\n\nI hugged her tight then, as if she might fall through the floor. I felt something on my cheek. It was a tear that had dropped from her face. Then we both cried, for a long time, just like that.\n\nLauren and I talked on the phone that day, and I told her I’d like us to create a potion or a spell that could take away so much death, that could pull out the grief.\n\nShe stopped by, and we walked to a nearby park, swiped the snow off the swing seats, revealing the wood with chipped green paint, with names and words scored with knives. We sat down, and she understood my sadness.\n\nLauren said we would remember these days when we were in high school together.\n\n“These are the days where everything starts.”\n\n“My dad’s dying wish was that I would go to this dumb school, out in the burbs.”\n\n“We’ll see,” she said. “Let’s make a spell for it.”\n\nI pushed back a little on the seat, and then forward. “A spell to be friends forever.”\n\nShe said, without even asking, “Eternal Mother, we vow to be friends forever, to right the wrongs. Send us the signs we need to know.”\n\nCurtains moved at the house next to the park. It must have been Crazy Ethel, watching us.\n\n“We don’t want signs,” I said. “Take that back.”\n\n“Why?’\n\n“Signs are dangerous. Great Mother, heal my mother of her grief. We vow to be friends forever, but forget what Lauren just said about signs.”\n\n“You can’t take back a spell,” Lauren said.\n\n“I just did.”\n\n“It’s in all the books.”\n\n“Still did it,” I said.\n\n***\n\nI thought of Lauren’s spell two days later, as Mom and I watched the news in the den. A picture of Jill Robinson’s face came up, the girl from grade school who’d moved away. The picture was the one taken at our school. We had a black-and-white television, so it was all hard to see.\n\n“Mom,” I said. “I knew her.”\n\n“That girl?”\n\n“Yeah, she moved last summer.”\n\nThe reporter said Jill had been shot in the face. Her body had been dumped on the side of the freeway.\n\nThe reporter stood on the side of I-75, the part in the good, rich suburb, and said, “They dumped her body here.”\n\n“That’s horrible,” Mom said.\n\nI saw a spot in the snow. It was gray. I couldn’t imagine Jill going with any guy. She was too shy. She’d have run. Did the man cast a spell on her? It wasn’t fair. She was the nicest person I knew.\n\nI leaned in, trying to make out the stain.\n\n“That’s awful,” Mom said. “But they’ll find who did it.”\n\n“Is that blood?” I asked. Mom leaned forward, too.\n\n“No, that’s just dirt. It’s the freeway.”\n\n“Uh-huh.”\n\n“Whoever did this moved her,” she said. “We’ll pray for Jill. Jill Robinson.”\n\n“I’ll pray that whoever killed her rots in hell,” I said. I had done, I thought then, all the wrong spells. I’d cast a spell for a dollar when I should have cast one to protect Jill’s life.\n\nMom turned to me, as if shaken from a trance. “You and Lauren need to be more careful.”\n\n“Don’t worry, Mom,” I said. “We have special powers.”\n\n“Somebody should.”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nMom stared at the television, even the corny car ads. I wanted to grab her hand, go get ice cream. She was in a daze, but I couldn’t let her go, not to my father, and not to the rip in the sky that made us all so vulnerable, that could swallow us whole.\n\n“Maybe all the energies of this world protect you,” I said. I held her hand.\n\nShe couldn’t take her eyes away from the television. I didn’t blame her. I, too, longed for the numbness, for the cold, for grief to freeze midair. But if we went, all that would be left were the child killers, the doctors who didn’t cure cancer, the husbands who cheated on their wives. The Charles Mansons of the world would take over.\n\nI went into the kitchen and took my father’s carrot-cake muffin, cut it in half, and brought it back to the couch. I picked up my half, “Here’s to the ones who protect us from the other side. Who show us the way to happier days.”\n\n“Amen to that,” she said, and picked up her half. She bit into the cream-cheese frosting, the orange carrot center. It tasted so good, as if these bites conjured autumn in the rain, sweet roots fresh from the soil, as if right then the seasons promised to encircle us with wonder after wonder, in the days of our lament.\n\n***\n\nMaureen Aitken’s short-story collection, The Patron Saint of Lost Girls, won the Nilsen Prize, the Foreword Review INDIE Prize (Top Prize for General Fiction), and was listed as one of the Kirkus Best Indie Books of the Year.

Most of them require typical martial facts (name, numbers) and writing samples, while one includes a prompt. This year’s prompt: “If you could select one literary text that every English major should read, what would you select and why?”\n\nThe question seems simple—all one has to do is reach over to the bookshelf and pick a favorite at random—but the modifier of literary, seemingly slipped in so frivolously, skews the earth’s axis and hurls the cosmos into the ocean. What exactly does it mean to be literary? How can we define or, even, show it?\n\nI think the answer can be found in the texts themselves. I’ve been reading submissions at TMR for a year now. Most of the job is analyzing stories and trying to put into words why they do or don’t function well. Sometimes it’s fairly easy: there is no characterization, or the style relies on clichés. Other times a story is perfect mechanically, but it lacks the indescribable quality of great writing, a unified force of magic that, I suppose, we describe as “literary,” the popularly pithy label like the hundreds of others we invent to try to express the matter that lies in the area between life and literature.\n\nI’ve read in many places and heard from many people that “literary” is only a term used to market books. That’s a fair argument, though I think it’s too easy of an escape to the question of what makes something literary, and I don’t want to fall into the whirlpool of genre fiction debates and how some works are misunderstood, etc. etc. This adjective also isn’t just limited to books, as by now it’s accepted that genres like film and music and television can be well written, that they can transcend from the “ordinary” into the “literary.” But the adjective does come from the word literature, and it’s the genre whose works have longest lingered on our tongues and minds.\n\nIt’s easy to say that the components of literature must be present and masterfully executed to make something literary: vivid writing, developed characters, a complex plot. But what does that make of descriptive poetry, or a play?\n\nA few months ago I read Clare Cavanagh’s translation of Nonrequired Reading by Wislawa Szymborska. It’s a collection of newspaper columns in which Szymborska reviews various books that don’t usually get critiques (self-help books, an annual calendar) and uses them to muse on life. The micro-essays are terse and vivid, and they generate the cumulative feeling of having flipped through a poet’s notebook. But does that mean they’re not literary because they were published in newspapers, or because there are no sustained characters or plot, because the pieces don’t have many unifying qualities besides a premise and an inquisitive tone? Of course not.\n\nSo the aforementioned components can be present—they usually are—but they aren’t required. The effect, of magic and discovery, is required. For something to be literary, it must a regenerative force, a carefully constructed mirror, without a smudge or any the maker’s fingerprints. Every time somebody returns to a literary text, they see something different in it, an effect reliant on the present condition of the reader and the depth of the text. And every time somebody else goes to the text, they see similarities, but they detect different components. Both people see the eyes, but one sees the hair and the other sees the chin. Only the mirror-maker has the complete image, for their completion contains an intricate depth, as well as a mystery of having explored and created it.\n\nSome of our great mirror-makers are those deigned as literary authors. Shakespeare, of course, so skillfully implemented wordplay and interesting interactions and opposing ideas that his plays and sonnets continue to engage readers and scholars today, more than four hundred years since he wrote them. Flannery O’Connor merged concurrent literal, symbolic, and religious narratives in each of her Complete Stories. The writings of Willa Cather and Robert Frost, to take two other genres, can easily be read on literal terms, while masterful craft—ambiguity!—lurks behind their printed letters.\n\nIt should be noted that in the end the artist does not have full control over how they will be branded, whether their work earns them immortality, or even what readers understand of their writing. Of course, authors labor to limit confusion and misunderstanding, and to open certain parts of their writing to questions, whether to reflect life’s qualities, or to the imagination, or to complicate narrative, or to do whatever they want their art to do. But that’s not to be confused with confusion because of poorly-drawn scenes and characters. The mastery, of course, must be there.\n\nThe starchy observer might, again, argue that I’m being some sort of elitist by using these terms—literary, art, poetic—but it’s not mere labeling, or oppression. I doubt that the writers I mentioned earlier sat, with pen in hand, to develop an inspiration, thinking, I’m going to make this one literary, really literary—so it sticks for a long time. Greek bards didn’t recite hexameters to fossilize their echoes on eternity’s bookshelves. If one’s goal is to craft an emotional mimesis, to make their work like life, which has no certainty and definitely no neat resolution, then they will do so, and the label will come afterwards if they are successful. But it’s simply a label, and it’s the effects and qualities of that label that we’re after. Only time, like with all things, controls the rest.\n\nWhen Henry trudges into the rain at the end of A Farewell to Arms, there is no full resolution to his story, or his life. He has enough momentum to walk off the page and join us, for some time, strolling in our minds and our world. When Riggan leaps out of his hospital room window at the end of Birdman and his daughter comes in moments later, looking through it first at the ground and then to the sky, we have an ambiguous, open ending. The magic prevails. The suspension of disbelief continues to mesmerize us. The story lingers in our consciousness for much longer, and it becomes something more than a 300-page novel or a two-hour film. It becomes something magical, something so intricately constructed that it has a reality of its own. That, I suppose, is when we know that something is literary, that it, like the great mysteries of life, has the substance to survive the unyielding passage of time.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Martin Cathrae\n\nThe R&B Genuwine Book Club for Frequent Flyers: A True Hollywood Story\n\nBy Bradley Babendir\n\nI never expected Mr. & Mrs. Smith to feel like an apt metaphor for my relationship with my significant other, Rachel Rowsey. I didn’t expect to wake up on the morning of April 22, 2015 to read an assassination on my character penned by someone I trusted so much. But Mr. Smith didn’t expect Mrs. Smith to try to kill him, either. So I thank Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for their hard work and help getting through this tough time.\n\nUnfortunately, I’m not a trained assassin. Actually, that’s probably a good thing. Being a trained assassin seems like a miserable existence. I’ve watched enough Scandal to know that for sure. Fortunately, Rachel isn’t a trained assassin either, so nobody is going to die as a result of this feud.\n\nRegardless, I cannot stand by while I am accused of things that are simply not true. I was a journalism major for approximately one-quarter of my time as an undergraduate at the University of Missouri, which means I have an obligation to the truth. In Rachel’s column, she says that the “Books Received and Read” score in our relationship puts her up five to nothing.\n\nThis, readers and ravenous pursuers of all that is factual, is false. A slander. A lie. In June of 2013, Rachel gave me The Fault in our Stars, a book that I read in its entirety in a timely fashion. In the words of much-maligned Chicago White Sox announcer Hawk Harrelson, “you can put it on the board, yes!” That’s one for Bradley. At worst, 5 to 1.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! The fifth book to which she refers is The Confessions of Noa Weber, a book which she has not yet finished. I have also not yet finished The Pillars of the Earth. This means the score is either 5 to 2, or 4 to 1. Either way, that’s some big progress for Team Brad. Movin’ on up.\n\nThe controversy does not stop there, either. It never does. As Ms. Rowsey mentioned in her column, I also read two of the books for which she is giving herself credit. Technically, I gave them to myself in order to read them alongside her (as was the basis of her column), so they cannot be counted for my score. However, reading those books did cut into my free reading time, which made it harder to finish the books that I was given. I’m not saying the game was rigged, but I’m not not saying it, either. It’s the book club equivalent of the 2002 NBA Western Conference Finals.\n\nFurthermore, I have to call into question the entire system of scoring itself. A book is not a standard unit of measurement. What really matters, when it all comes down to it, is page count. Tiny babies read tons of books. Because the books they read are tiny. Do those tiny babies deserve credit for reading all those books? No, they don’t. Babies can’t do anything. Rachel, who is not a tiny baby (95% confidence in that statement), has read 1600 pages. I, on the other hand, have read 1348. Yes, I’m still losing. But I’m a lot closer.\n\nBut, am I still losing? No. Enter the last truth bomb:\n\nPure volume statistics never give a fair picture. Efficiency is important. In this case, the number of books read should be considered in the context of the number of books gifted in the first place. And here is where Ms. Rowsey greatly falters. By my count, Rachel has given me three books. I’ve finished (or nearly finished) two. That’s a .667 batting average. Those are all-time great numbers. Triple crown numbers. All-Star. Hall of fame. Meanwhile, I have given Ms. Rowsey 11 books, of which she has finished six. That’s a .545 batting average. Great, elite, Hall of Fame, too. As good as .667? I don’t think so.\n\nWhy You Should Read a Book and Stop Skimming Wikipedia\n\nBy Lance Nichols\n\nAt the beginning of next semester it will be two years since my hometown high school went completely digital. All students received a school-issued Mac, virtually all textbooks shelved for inexpensive, downloadable files, and paper homework is nearly nonexistent. Every student would be apart of the network and use web apps to complete assignments, much like Blackboard in college. When I was told this educational “evolution” was going to take place the year following my graduation, I, with the rest of my graduating class, felt slighted. We had to hand-write most of our work and lug around old, outdated textbooks. Who doesn’t want a “free” Mac-book to listen to music, play MMORPGs (massively-multiplayer, online role-playing games), and sometimes do homework?\n\nI feel quite differently now.\n\nOn this, The Missouri Review’s slick, sleek website, it is fairly easy to find and accomplish any task a reasonable Internet surfer might imagine they need to perform, whether or not they are familiar with the literary magazine. That is good. I’d like to think the straightforward nature of our website might lead to an increase of submissions from authors that otherwise wouldn’t think to submit—authors who, for whatever reason, have no familiarity with literary magazines, entirely. It is always my goal to listen for voices that might otherwise go unheard, and what better way to do that than with the exposure and access the Internet gives to residents and users? It’s the democratization of the voice, itself, right?\n\nThis hopeful, progressive sentiment is doubtful. Visitors to our site are likely to be subscribers or prior submitters—a smaller, insular group with specific, literary interest. Though it is disheartening to see that population continue to shrink, it doesn’t make literature and the literary world any less valuable.\n\nQuite true, inversely, just because something is popular doesn’t make it good. Unfortunately, that is the mechanic of the Internet. In fact, the route through which I’m sure many of you came to this post, Google, has a business model that runs as cool as a perpetual-motion machine thanks to its ingenious algorithms and marketing scheme. Roughly, AdWords presents sites with high-traffic and high ad-space bids. But content filtered by traffic is not truly representative. The obvious implication is that, first, our choice of search engine will have at least some effect on our results, but also it will be those on the Internet the most who will determine what the rest of us see. Don’t believe me? Just open up a new tab to Youtube, pick a video about or involving a woman (but really, this would work with truly any video), and scroll down to the comments. Notice that they shrilly screech with a distinctly masculine tone. There are those or any of the other organized, anti-feminist outbursts that erupt with seeming regularity. Beyond that, as stated before, those sites that are going to get the most traffic not only must be seen, they must be quick and easy to use—they must be “intuitive.”\n\nSuch is TMR’s great website: economic use of space, cohesive design, blocks of text only where completely necessary, such as submission instructions and blog posts. Even with the latter, brevity is key. Reading on the Internet is characterized by text that can be skimmed, and, Wikipedia-like, peppered with hyperlinks that lead off and away down an information rabbit-hole. Telling is the fact that on any of Wikipedia’s millions of pages, clicking on the first link in the text and then repeating the process for subsequent articles will inevitably lead you to the page for “philosophy.” I’m definitely not the first to illustrate how antithetical such superficial reading practices are to understanding any philosophy; as any meme will tell you, the Internet loves irony.\n\nSo how do"
