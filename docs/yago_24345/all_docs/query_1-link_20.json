        "text": "Post by togetherforever on\n\nCharacter Basics\n\nFull Name: Thaddeus James Martin\n\nNickname(s): Tad, Tad The Cad\n\nAge: 48\n\nAppearance\n\nLook:\n\nScars or Tattoos: N/A\n\nPortrayed By: Michael E. Knight\n\nPersonality:\n\nBasic Personality: Tad Martin is a good man who's seen his ups and downs through life. There's a reason why some people call him Tad \"The Cad\" since back in the old days as a teenager, he hooked up with a lot of women. Now Tad has changed into a responsible man with new vaules. He loves his family and friends, always trying to lighten up the mood or cheering others up by joking around. Tad will defend the people he cares about in a hearbeat when all hell brakes loose, to support them. He's not perfect and knows that but tries everyday to do good in Pine Valley.\n\nAccent: None\n\nOccupation: Private Investigator & Partner in Martin and Devane Investigations\n\nHistory\n\nBirthplace: It all started when Tad was just ten years old, left and abandon thanks to his abusive father, Ray Gardner.\n\nFamily: Ray Gardner (biological father - deceased) , Opal Cortlandt (biological mother), Joe Martin (adoptive father), Ruth Parker (adoptive father), Adrian Sword (brother), Jenny Gardner (sister), , Pete Cortlandt (half brother), Jeff Martin (adoptive brother), Tara Martin (adoptive brother), Phil Brent (adoptive brother), Bobby Martin (brother adoptive), Jake Martin (brother adoptive)\n\nFriends: Jessie Hubbard, Angela Hubbard,Krystal Carey, Liza Colby, Ryan Lavery, Brooke English, Jackson Montgomery, Erica Kane Montgomery...\n\nRomantic Connections: Pam Coulson, Dottie Thornton, Liza Colby, Marian Colby, Dixie Cooney\n\nBarbara Montgomery, Francesca, Skye Chandler Quartermaine, Gloria Marsh, Leslie Coulson\n\nSimone Torres, Krystal Carey, Diana Henry, Hannah Nichols, Taylor Thompson.\n\nCurrent - Dixie Cooney Martin\n\nHistory: Thaddeus James Martin was born on September 1, 1963 to Ray Gardner and Opal\n\nSample Post:\n\nThaddeus James Martin needed a walk in the park to clear his head a bit. He just finished a case he worked on since he's a Private Investigator and still does it to this day. The job required hard work and a lot of detective skills and people wondered why he couldn't join the PVPD or another part of law enforcement. Tad knew people in the PVPD wouldn't stand him or even would not work with him, except for the Chief of Police, his best friend, Jesse Hubbard. It's safer for him to stay as PI and even though Dixie was worried about his safety, she gave him her blessing. Dixie's always supports Tad despite it involving action and danger, and Tad always has his lady's back.\n\nSitting down on the bench, Tad took a deep breath, breathing in and out slowly. He looked around, seeing children playing on the swings, the rides, everything. It made him smile, remembering everything about his girls, his boys, how much they meant to him. Even though JR and Jamie are grown adults, he'll never regret being the father they needed, especially to Kathy, Jenny, etc. He learned how to love and live thanks to Joe and Ruth, The Martin Family. They took him into there home, teaching Tad the responsibilities and lessons on how to be a man. Suddenly his cell phone rang and he took it out seeing the ID. He press the button to accept and put it close to his ear. \"Hello?\" he asked whoever it was."
