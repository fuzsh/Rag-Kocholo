        "text": "1 9 7 0 – 2 0 1 1 (USA)\n\n10,755 x 60 minute episodes\n\nFirst airing on Monday 5 January 1970, this long-running ABC soap concerned itself with the lives of the Chandler family, the Tyler family and the Martin family.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Martin family had become history (they were to reappear years later) while the Tyler family became the show’s primary set of characters.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Pine Valley, not far from New York City, the show was never afraid to tackle the odd controversial subject in its time and was the first daytime soap to air the issue of abortion.\n\nWithout question, the most popular character to appear on All My Children was the infamous femme fatale, Erica Kane, played by Susan Lucci. Erica became the woman viewers loved to hate – a self-centred, ambitious woman who, during the course of the show, was married no less than 11 times to eight different men in 24 years.\n\nHer chain of inter-personal relationships and marriages was so frequent and complex that she ended up with a hyphenated surname longer than the average firm of lawyers: Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler.\n\nBy 1991, five of the original cast were still on the show; veteran film actress Ruth Warrick, Susan Lucci, Mary Fickett, Frances Heflin and Ray MacDonnell.\n\nOver the years, hundreds of performers played regular running roles in the series, including such familiar names as Anne Meara, Ann Flood, Kelly Rippa and Lauren Holly. Actress/comedienne Carol Burnett made a guest appearance in 1976 playing a hospital patient, and she returned as a regular character for several episodes in 1983.\n\nScreen legend Elizabeth Taylor, who was a devoted fan of the series, played a walk-on role on the show, as she had done before on the General Hospital series.\n\nIn 1995, All My Children celebrated its 25th year on television with a week of special episodes that commemorated its successful, audience-pleasing past as one of television’s most popular daytime drama series.\n\nAs with most US daytime soaps, ratings declined in the new millennium and the final episode of All My Children aired in September 2011.\n\nAll My Children was the creation of prolific soap opera writer Agnes Nixon, who was also responsible for such hit daytime series’ as Another World, Search For Tomorrow and One Life To Live.\n\nDr Charles Tyler\n\nHugh Franklin\n\nPhoebe Tyler-Wallingford\n\nRuth Warrick\n\nAnn Tyler\n\nDianna De Vegh (1) Joanna Mills (2) Judith Barcroft (3)\n\nLincoln Tyler\n\nPeter White\n\nErica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler\n\nSusan Lucci\n\nAmy Parker Tyler\n\nRosemary Prinz\n\nBrooke English Cudahy Chandler Martin Martin\n\nJulia Barr\n\nRuth Parker Brent Martin\n\nMary Fickett\n\nDr Joseph Joe Martin Sr\n\nRay MacDonnell\n\nKate Martin\n\nKay Campbell\n\nAdam Chandler\n\nDavid Canary\n\nStuart Chandler\n\nDavid Canary\n\nSean Cudahy\n\nAlan Dysert\n\nHector Santos\n\nRaúl Dávila\n\nLenny Wlasuk/ Professor Langley Wallingford\n\nLouis Edmonds\n\nStan ”Mr. U” Ulatowski\n\nEugene J.
