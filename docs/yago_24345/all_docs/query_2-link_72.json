        "text": "Bringing back a topic from the old thread\n\nTaylor Miller (Nina) said one of the reasons she left, was that they kept repeating the same story-line of breaking up Cliff and Nina, and then having them get back together.\n\nIronically when she left, and was replaced by Heather Stanford, Taylor said if she knew what the writers had in store (having Nina go crazy and then wind up with memory loss) she would not have left as that was a dynamite storyline. She said she was a bit envious she didn't get a chance to do that.\n\nEveryone here said Heather Stanford sucked, but she graduated from Yale School of Drama, so maybe she is more of a theater actress and TV is not her medium? Peter Bergman also did say he questioned her acting abilities as well. But if that is the case, how did she get through Yale?\n\nAnyways go 1:25 into video to see Nina ( Heather Stanford) go absolutely crazy (which is why Taylor wished she had not quit, as she would have loved to play Nina crazy)\n\nI knew any hope of the show rebounding was over for good when they did the Vanessa drug lord story. Plus the timeline was so screwy at the time -- in order to make her Sam Page's mother with Richard Fields - they had her Hollywood starlet phase when she was about 40. And she also managed to have two later in life children close together that no one knew about, including her grown or almost grown son.\n\nIt is too bad because she was really good as an amoral - borderline sociopath socialite who hated Erica and dug her claws into Palmer and had a creepy relationship with son Leo and antagonistic relationship with David. The show went from almost being back on track with some good recent hires to starting the final decent down the drain.\n\nI always thought the initial plan was to make David be Eric Kane's son. It would have fit into Vanessa being a young starlet and marrying the person David thought was his father out of necessity and being resentful for being in a loveless marriage. It also fit with why she had a secret vendetta against Erica when she first came to town. That obviously changed when Erica and David became involved. Heyward and Lucci had good chemistry, but they did not do much with them as a couple, and think they could have gotten more long term out of them being siblings. They certainly had certain personality similarities. It would have added some extra drama when David hid the fact Babe's baby was actually Bianca's.\n\nVanessa vs. Erica was more interesting than Vanessa vs. Greenlee. Erica and Vanessa were better matched, whereas the would put Greenlee in helpless ingenue mode (which she normally was not) and Vanessa would easily devour her. Plus Vanessa was more subtle and sneaky early on which made her scheming against Erica more interesting.\n\nSome of those '80s clips, Lucci is overwrought and I remember her shrieking when Mona died, but it made sense because this was Erica Kane losing her mother.\n\nI agree that the Bianca intervention, Lucci was fabulous. I think when Lucci underplayed, it was her biggest strength. When Erica had to compose herself and drop the airs, she was really fabulous. I think my all-time favourite scene was the goodbye scenes with SMG's Kendall. Seeing Erica try to say goodbye to a daughter she can't bring herself to fully love was some strong acting. Actually both Lucci and SMG were amazing. The tension between them actually worked in the scenes because there was a wall that both were trying to break down but couldn't and it resonated with the characters.\n\nI don't think there is anything embarrassing about crying at a scene like Myrtle's death. Some of the deaths on AMC were hard because we knew the actors had died as well.\n\nActually these threads have really moved me because I realize how much I loved and miss AMC and wish it was back on the air. And seeing all the love for the show and its characters - and referencing characters who I thought I only remembered (calling Gloria!) is why I love Datalounge.\n\nThe Kendall - Erica goodbye scene was well done. It was nice to see them take the high road with the exit when they could have easily had Kendall written out by going full-psycho. They did a nice job balancing them coming to terms and really wishing each other well, but knowing that they would probably never be close.\n\nUntil there was a recast years later, although even then they actually did a pretty good job of taking their time of them becoming close and doing it in stages. They did not go from hating each other to Kendall calling Erica mom - there was a transition stage where they were civil but not esp. close, but they both cared about Bianca.\n\nI agree with the decline in writing on soaps. Whoever wrote Erica's testimony dialogue did a great job of outlining the horror of the rape with just a few descriptions. Good acting by a lot of people in this episode, and the actress playing Livia had enough gravitas that she was a believable lawyer. You also got to see Mona be bad ass one last time. Frau Heflin must have gotten sick not too long after that.\n\nThe other scene that stands out for me that Lucci effectively underplayed was when she returned Maria's baby to her. I actually thought, as bad as that story line was, that she might win an Emmy from that scene.\n\nI agree with the insights on Erica. Her overall journey as a character - specifically how she was written and positioned - was interesting.\n\nIn the 70s, she filled a story function - she was the troublemaker and a catalyst for story (like Phoebe). Agnes wrote a very human reason - her need for love because of abandonment issues. Obviously the character took off and they devoted more screen time to her.\n\nThat resulted in having to up the stakes and the stories for Erica. Combined with the overall \"glitz\" of the 80s, you get Erica the model, becoming famous, etc. The wonderful serendipity of it is, by this time, the writers realized that Lucci had comedic abilities and could pull off Erica's outrageous narcissism in a funny and charming manner. Thus you get what I call the \"glory years\" for Erica - from about 1980 - 1987 - where the character was primarily played for comedic purposes. I do not think it's a coincidence that this is the time frame where Lucci started to become a household name (helped in part by the Emmy losses).\n\nStarting in 1987 with Travis through the mid 90s, Erica lost her edge. A big part of that was the birth of Bianca which, understandably, was a decision made to help the character grow and evolve (as much as I would have loved Erica to continue as an unchecked ego maniac, I can understand why others might not). This period - for me - is remembered more for the quality of the stories than Erica herself. People were obsessed with Erica and Jack but I found them boring. The Kendall story, despite making zero sense continuity wise, was interesting and gave Lucci something good to play.\n\nThe pill addiction story from 95-96 was, to me, the last great Erica story. I thought Lucci was fantastic, not only in her breakdown speech but in the powder room scenes before (whispering to herself in the mirror \"I am Erica Kane. I am Erica Kane\" as a mantra of reinforcement to herself to not fall apart). Her screaming at Maria and Brooke, crawling on the bathroom floor picking up dropped pills, lashing out at Myrtle. Those episodes ranged from comedy to tragedy in a moment. They were great.\n\nAfter that, it seemed the writers didn't really know what to do with Erica. They knew they needed to write for her because she was the face of the show and the most famous daytime star out there. But Erica had already become famous, and matured (slightly) due to the deaths of Mona and the birth of Bianca. Also, post pill story, I noticed Lucci seemed to get more self conscious in her acting. The posturing, posing and hair flipping started to increase. It was almost if she was trying to fight her age through making Erica more coquettish. The unfortunate thing was that no one seemed to try to figure out what the next big journey for Erica was. What does the latter half of life look like for, ultimately, an incredibly insecure person who has achieved so much? A \"lose everything and start over\" story could have been interesting but they never went there.\n\nWhen Erica was positioned as reactionary to her family there was interesting material: Bianca's intervention, coming out, rape, the baby switch. You got to see her be the mama bear, which Lucci played well. And they never, NEVER played her comedic skills enough. She's actually a good comic actress.\n\nWhat would Erica have been like from 97-2011 if she had the same level of clarity that she had for her first 27 years? I've always wondered. What do you all think?\n\nRegardless, I miss this show. I miss Erica. Life is so scary and hard. Knowing Pine Valley was there, day in and day out, always gave me a little bit of comfort in its stability. It is so sorely missed.\n\nThe waitress story line was when she was Erica was in hiding from Travis after she discovered he faked his kidnapping which led to Bianca being kidnapped. It always irritated me how Travis basically blamed everything on Erica for the demise of their first marriage when what he did was really unforgivable.\n\nNice post R297. I wish more of the 70's stuff would have survived. I agree, while the Woman of the Year speech was memorable, I thought the episode leading up to it where everything went wrong, Erica finding out Adam bought her award, the press overhearing Dimitri tell her they were through, the spilled wine, the trembling while trying to put on lipstick in the bathroom was the one where her acting really shone.\n\nThis is more of Eden's story, but her last good story line might have been the coming out story. Lucci had no problems showing Erica as a very flawed mother.. Even before the coming out when planning a big party for Bianca, I thought she really nailed the narcissistic mother who has a hard time not seeing her daughter as an extension of herself. I also thought she was used well in the end of the baby switch story line. There was a scene when she goes to see the baby and silently realizes the baby is a Kane and you see all of the reactions on her face - including a quick -- I will cut you Tad as he tries to pull her away. It was odd that the story ended with Babe far away during the resolution and Bianca in a coma (the ultimate confrontation was pretty tame), but Lucci Canary, and Jacob Young really did some good work bringing the story to its conclusion. The scenes between Erica and Adam used their history well.\n\n[quote]Erica is the only one I know who can screw on soap operas, take no birth control pills or anything and never get pregnant\n\nExcept for when she was taking birth control during her marriage to Tom, and while Erica did not become pregnant, Lucci sure did. I do remember a scene with Erica and Mona when Erica discovered she was pregnant with Bianca. Mona basically asked her was she not being careful, and Erica replied they were, but whoever said accidents usually happen at home was correct. Funny how I can remember scenes from the 80's and early 90's and have basically forgotten every plot post 2003.\n\nThe Eric Kane as a clown was one of the stranger ones. When she was starting to suspect that he was her father, they made a big deal of him faking his death and alluding that he had done something wrong and might be dangerous. Once she brought him home, that was completely ignored - no legal consequences and no criminal ties. They even underplayed the emotional repercussions for his actions in faking his death not to mention causing major abandonment issues for Erica growing up.\n\nThey briefly teased that he might get involved with Natalie, but mostly he was just a sounding board for Erica and someone to side with Travis during the Erica/Jack/Travis triangle. I think his exit story was a handful of episodes. He and Erica had a disagreement and out of spite he left an sold his Enchantment shares to Natalie or Adam. It was odd, because he and Erica had been getting a long well and it seemed like an extreme reaction. His year on the show as barely a supporting character was strange considering who he was and all the issues he had caused that had driven Erica for the entire run of the show. If you are going to bring Eric Kane back from the dead (which was a mistake in the first place) - do something with him.\n\nLucci had such good chemistry with her brother and had some nice scenes before and after the intervention - but yes - the episode was not her best dramatic moment. I wonder how she would have played it ten years later when she was starting to down play some of her crying scenes. He showed up for her alcohol intervention. There were a few moments there where I thought she was going to go over the top -- but she ended keeping it reigned in for the most part.\n\nLoved Erica and Adam going at it and Erica's bad Raising Kane acting. I kind of wish they would have gone with Erica and Adam as an actual couple at the end of the series, which they appeared to be doing but instead went with Erica and Ryan and Adam and Annie. Although their friendship was pretty good at that point and a true romantic pairing probably would have blown that up. Still it would have been better than Ryan or Jack part 10.\n\nKristen Jensen (first Laurel) was an ex-model. She had done some acting, but nothing really major. She wasn't really given anything too challenging during her short 3-month stint and thought she did well enough with what she was given. Her Laurel was a mystery woman. She gave an interview to one of the soap magazines afterwards and said she was totally blindsided by the firing. The producers didn't indicate they had any problems with her work or that she needed to change anything. She just had gotten an apartment too since she was living in LA when she landed the part.\n\nI'm not sure if she could've handled the more difficult storylines La Fortune's Laurel got, like her evil ex showing up, her killing him in self defense and hiding the body. La Fortune did pull that of well, but Laurel soon became very insufferable. Fans were rooting for Janet over her (and they certainly did try writing Janet into a corner, and were even set to write her off at one point, just goes to show how good Robin Mattson was as Janet). Funny how fans can change things when they aren't buying what they writers/producers are selling.\n\nA lot of people blame The Ice Princess for the death of soaps. But it wasn't the first crazy adventure story on the soaps. Hell, even Ryan's Hope - which won Emmy's for Best Writing six times during its short lifespan - had storylines about an Egyptian Mummy curse, and King Kong where a gorilla kidnapped Delia, and that was before the Ice Princess.\n\nBut perhaps the popularity of The Ice Princess caused the balance to shift. It was just one story at the time, but after its success it seemed that crazy escapades became the norm rather than the occasional. I think it's sentiments like R460 that changed what soaps originally were. I liked listening in on those conversations between friends, hearing their takes on the events going on around them. I liked the slower pacing... miss a day or two, and catch right back up.\n\n(I'm reminded of the scene in Golden Girls where Blanche is reading the comic strip Apartment 3-G in the newspaper. Dorothy gets nostalgic, and mentions she hasn't read it in years. Blanche tells her she'll get her caught up: \"it's later the same day...\")\n\nComing from someone who wasn't a huge Ice Princess fan, the first part of that story was excellent, the introduction of Alex Quartermaine, Laura becoming secretary at ELQ and developing a rivalry with Alex, Lesley having split from Rick and starting to date Tony Cassadeine, and everyone on the hunt for the Ice Princess even if they didn't exactly know why it was so valuable. Once they revealed the power of the Ice Princess and introduced the Cassedeine's island, they lost me.\n\nKelsey had a lot of potential - esp. when she still had a bit of an edge. I think the actor playing Bobby had left by then, they messed up Scott, and they Kevin story line had run its course, so I wonder if they just decided to scrap that whole young adult set. They might have shifted to Ryan-Gillian-Greenlee by this time. I thought Greenlee showed up to stalk Cosgrove's Scott.\n\nI actually kind of liked Charlie and Cecily. Too bad they did not put a little more effort into their story. By that time, they did not spend much time on the second tier players. The show was shifting utilizing their entire cast - tier one players on 3 to 4 times a week - second tier players 2 to 3 times a week, three or four story lines on during a day --- to having the same people on every single day for weeks at a time. There is a reason why so many of the supporting players introduced never took off in the later years, people would only see them 3 to 5 times in a month."
