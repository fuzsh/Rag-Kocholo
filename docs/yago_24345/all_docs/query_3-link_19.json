        "text": "Post by Di Henry on\n\nCharacter Basics\n\nFull Name: Di Henry\n\nNickname(s):\n\nAge: 38\n\nAppearance\n\nScars or Tattoos: None visible\n\nPortrayed By: Kelli Giddish\n\nAccent: Southern/American\n\nOccupation: Fusion employee\n\nBasic Personality: Very tough, independent and brave. Tries to do the right thing most of the time but can be deceptive. Good sense of humor and adventurous. Cares deeply for family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBirthplace: Crow Hollow, West Virginia\n\nFamily:\n\nSeabone Hunkle (father)\n\nLila Kirby (mother)\n\nDel Henry (brother)\n\nWill Cortlandt ( half-brother)\n\nDixie Cooney-Martin (half-sister)\n\nLanie Cortlandt (half-sister)\n\nLouise Kirby (aunt)\n\nJ.R Chandler (half-nephew)\n\nKathy Martin (half-niece)\n\nAdam Chandler III (half-great-nephew)\n\nFriends: Tad Martin, J.R Chandler, Brooke English, Aidan Devane\n\nRomantic Connections:\n\nGarret Williams (lover)\n\nKevin Sturgess (lover)\n\nTad Martin (lover)\n\nAidan Devane (lover)\n\nHistory:\n\nDi was raised in Crow Hollow by her Aunt Louise after she was too much of a burden for her mother to handle, and always wanted to belong to a real family. She later wound up behind bars where she met Krystal Carey and was introduced to David Hayward. David was fascinated with Di because of her similarities to her presumed dead half sister Dixie Martin. After Di was released she was nearly run over by her ex boyfriend, who was afraid since Di was out of prison she'd come clean about his crimes.\n\nDavid agreed to help Di start over, if she went along with his plan to impersonate Dixie, so she could use her influence on J.R/help Babe get custody of Little Adam. Di agreed to the plan, dyed her hair blonde, and took a job as a nanny at the Chandler Mansion under the name Diana Cole, where J.R and later Tad, felt an instant connection to her. David played on this by manipulating DNA and fingerprints and managed to convince Tad and J.R that Di really was Dixie.\n\nDi-xie then revealed she stayed away after losing Kate and undergoing reconstructive surgeries, because she sank into a depression, but came back because she needed her family. J.R accepted Di-xie as his mother, while Tad was suspicious and hurt she would stay away from him.\n\nHowever Di/David's plan unraveled when Del Henry came to town, and concluded that Di-xie was really his other half sister, however he agreed to keep Di's secret.\n\nAlso at this time, Garret \"Dragon\" Williams, who had killed Noah Keefer and was now targeting his widow Julia was back in town, and Di's past with him came back to bite her when she and Julia were nearly killed by Garret. After the incident, Tad learned Di wasn't Dixie, but it did not stop him and J.R from eventually forgiving her, and Tad eventually proposing.\n\nHowever, once Dixie came back to Pine Valley alive and well, and Di agreed to keep her sister's secret, Tad ended his relationship with her.\n\nDespite all the drama, eventually Di bonded with her sister and regained her relationship with her family when she helped in the search for Kate. She also got involved with Aidan Devane and took a job working at Fusion when the Satin Slayer crimes began. Later she moved to New York but was involved in a confusing, dangerous scheme of Annie Lavery's when she set her up for the kidnapping of her daughter Emma, and was seemingly killed in a struggle over a gun during a confrontation with Annie.\n\nHowever due to a case of mistaken identity, Di is very much alive and is trying to return to Pine Valley to start her life over."
