        "text": "For the first time in memory, ABC received the most nominations in bids for the 25th annual Daytime Emmy Awards announced Wednesday, edging perennial leader CBS.\n\nCBS still possessed the most-nominated program, its top-rated soap opera “The Young and the Restless,” which accounted for 18 of the network’s 49 nominations. ABC garnered 52 nominations--twice the total for NBC--while PBS tallied 48.\n\nIn what has become the most closely watched part of the annual ceremony, “All My Children’s” Susan Lucci also secured her 18th nomination as best actress in a drama, having never won for the long-running ABC soap.\n\n“All My Children” received 17 Emmy bids in all, while 16 went to another ABC serial, “General Hospital,” which has claimed the Emmy as outstanding drama three straight years. Those two programs will again vie for honors in that category, along with “Young and the Restless” and NBC’s “Days of Our Lives.”\n\nIn its second year of eligibility, “The Rosie O’Donnell Show” also reaped the most nominations of any series in the talk-show balloting, with 13, compared to eight for her top syndicated competitor, “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” and for ABC’s Barbara Walters panel show “The View.”\n\nIn addition to those three entries, best talk-show nominees are NBC’s “Leeza” and the syndicated “Live With Regis & Kathie Lee.” Last year, the Emmy voters chose O’Donnell as best host, but Winfrey’s program was named outstanding talk show.\n\nThe high-rated syndicated tandem “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” are again nominated in the game show category, joined by last year’s winner “The Price Is Right,” “Pictionary” and the offbeat cable series “Win Ben Stein’s Money.”\n\nAs usual, PBS’ “Sesame Street” walked away with the most nominations among children’s programs, with 11, followed by seven apiece for “Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy,” “Reading Rainbow” and “Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?”\n\nThe WB network also totaled 10 nominations--twice as many as better-established competitors Fox Kids Network and Nickelodeon--for its children’s fare. Two WB programs that carry the imprimatur of director Steven Spielberg, “Pinky and the Brain” and “Animaniacs,” nabbed bids as outstanding animated program.\n\nOther lead acting candidates include Lucci’s co-star David Canary, Eileen Davidson (“Days of Our Lives”), Jacklyn Zeman and Anthony Geary of “General Hospital,” “Guiding Light’s” Cynthia Watros and Kim Zimmer, Kin Shriner (ABC’s “Port Charles”), and Eric Braeden and Peter Bergman, from “The Young and the Restless.”\n\nPrograms airing between Feb. 6, 1997, and Dec. 31, 1997, were eligible for consideration. The awards, presented in 59 categories by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, will be televised May 15 as a prime-time special on NBC.\n\nSome of the other major nominations:\n\n* Lead actress, drama series: Susan Lucci (as Erica Kane), “All My Children,” ABC; Eileen Davidson (as Kristen), “Days of Our Lives,” NBC; Jacklyn Zeman (as Bobbie Spencer), “General Hospital,” ABC; Cynthia Watros (as Annie Dutton) and Kim Zimmer (as Reva Shayne), “Guiding Light,” CBS.\n\n* Lead actor, drama series: David Canary (as Adam Chandler), “All My Children,” ABC; Anthony Geary (as Luke Spencer), “General Hospital,” ABC; Kin Shriner (as Scotty Baldwin), “Port Charles,” ABC; Eric Braeden (as Victor Newman) and Peter Bergman (as Jack Abbott), “The Young and the Restless,” CBS.\n\n* Supporting actress, drama series: Julia Barr (as Brooke English), “All My Children,” ABC; Amy Carlson (as Josie Watts Sinclair), “Another World,” NBC; Vanessa Marcil (as Brenda Barrett), “General Hospital,” ABC; Amy Ecklund (as Abigail Blume), “Guiding Light,” CBS; Victoria Rowell (as Drucilla Winters), “The Young and the Restless,” CBS.\n\n* Supporting actor, drama series: Michael E.
