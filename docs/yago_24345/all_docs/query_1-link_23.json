        "text": "E.J. was born in 1997.\n\nPhilip was born in 1995, the same year Will was born. In fact, I remember Will and Philip would be babysat together or have playdates. Then Philip was aged in 1999 to a teenager.\n\nBelle was born in 1993. At John and Marlena's wedding she was the six-year-old flower girl and when they came back from their honeymoon she was 15.\n\nShawn was born in 1987.\n\nStephanie was born in 1990, and is now younger then Philip.\n\nBrady was born in 1992, I do believe. I noticed the show avoided showing Isabella's year of death on her gravestone this past week but showed her year of birth as 1965. So she was like 5-10 when she had him, depending on how old they are trying to make Brady now.\n\nIt may screw up timelines if they are especially callous, but by and large, I don't care. *I hate* watching (and waiting for) child characters to grow up on screen with their actors. It's tedious to me. IMO, no child actor on a soap should retain the role for longer than five years. Then its time to recast/SORAS. OLTL is terrible about finding eight year old child actors are keeping them into their twenties. I don't need to see an indefinite eleven/twelve year old version of a character, who is shown a few times a month playing video games and/or acting either too young or too wise for his age. You can't do anything with them during that stage. They're too young for the high school sex/drug storyline...and their too old to play the adorable tyke caught in the middle of a custody battle. Starr Manning should have SORAS/recast right around the time she ran away in New York, and Matthew Buchanan (well IMO EA shouldn't have been hired, period, but...) should have been aged up right around the time of Nora's stroke. How I long for the days of the mid-late 80s/early 90s, when kids like Kevin Buchanan went from being twelve one week to sixteen the next. I like the kid playing Jack Manning now, but in another year, I want him to be in high school.\n\nThis is a list I have been working on over at SoapsWEB. It is very incomplete but it lists the real birth years of characters based on the ages when they either debuted or were born onscreen:\n\n1940\n\nRobert \"Bob\" Hughes (son of Chris & Nancy Hughes, As The World Turns) - November 15\n\n1952\n\nMichael Bauer (son of Bill Bauer & Bertha Miller, The Guiding Light) - March\n\n1954\n\nPhillip Brent (son of Nick Davis & Amy Parker;

They are no where today because their story ran out long before it should have.\n\nIt is another example of stunt writing that ends up hurting a show in the long run just for a mometary benefit.\n\nWay too often characters were SORASed long before their time which resulted in good characters like Julie and Doug on Days, Ellen on ATWT, Claire on ATWT, David on Days and so many others being retired to pasture long before their story should have ended. Why do you think someone like Eileen Fulton did the Grandmother clause. She saw what SORASing did to Claire Lowell and Ellen Stewart.\n\nAnd William Bell made the biggest mistake he ever made in his career by pushing Mike Horton and David Banning to the ages he did way too soon. You would have thought he would have learned over at ATWT when he and Irna did the same thing to Dan Stewart.\n\nWhy waste a character before it's time.\n\nThat's pretty much how I see it.\n\nThere would be no need to do anything with them at that age because the stories would still be revolving around their parents, who, because of the lack of SORASing, would still be viewed as \"young\" instead of \"old.\" If SORAS never existed, Y&R would have an actual teen scene with Billy, Daniel, Lily, Colleen, and Nate right now. Jill would be 50 and not pushing 60. Victor and Nikki wouldn't be grandparents five times over by now, they'd still have a daughter who is 26 and a son who is 21. Look at B&B. Instead of Brooke having two kids pushing 30 (or is Ashley already over 30?), her oldest would be 19, and she wouldn't look so damn pathetic acting like a lovesick schoolgirl. Over to ATWT, going down the Lowell/Stewart line. Ellen had Dan in 1958, so he'd be 50 and she'd be about...oh, about 68 years old. Instead of Dan becoming father to Emily in 1972, he would have become father to her in around 1985 or 1986. Emily would be in her early 20s. Allison would be like 5 or 6 years old. Susan would be in her late 40s.\n\nIt makes me go grrr. When SORAS is used, it's like the writer is basically saying, \"Look, we don't have anything else to do with these characters anymore...we simply can not think of anything else to write at all for them, so we're going to push them aside and take their 10-year-old kids and make them 20-year-old kids. And then we'll tell with them the same stories we told with their parents.\" It's lazy writing at its worst, IMO.\n\nOLTL may not have the best younger set but I think they were smart not to rapid age most of their younger characters. Jessica, Starr, Matthew have all had stories which carried parts of the show (with Matthew, not the bullied in school story, but some of the stories leading up to his paralysis). You can get drama from rapidly aging kids, yes, but I can't say I've seen lots of great drama from that on soaps who have done that in recent years (I think the aging of Steffi/Phoebe on B&B just created two very boring young women who had no chemistry with any man they were paired with). In the long run neither Kevin nor Joey benefited from some of the rapid aging. Kevin was inexplicably aged 10+ years when Kirk Geiger was fired, and this led to two very unpopular recasts and a long period of irrelevance. Joey was a great teen character with Chris McKenna. Then he became an obviously much older man with Nathan Fillion. Was Nathan a great talent? Yes. But he only really had one good story (the fling with Dorian). Then after he left, nothing was left for Joey. He was increasingly disconnected from the show, he no longer had any real place in his family. He's been a non-presence for 12 years now, even during the time he's been on the show. Would that have happened if Chris had stayed around? I don't know."
