        "text": "Soap fans fond of hanging out in Llanview will have to wait a while for their next visit.\n\nProspect Park has decided to suspend production on One Life to Live until a lawsuit between the production company and ABC, the now-online soap’s former TV home, is resolved.\n\nIn the meantime, Prospect Park will focus on a second season of the revamped — and more popular, at least online — All My Children. According to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story, AMC writers are working on Season 2 scripts now.\n\nRELATED | AMC and OLTL Stars on What’s New — and Improved — About the Resurrected Dramas\n\nAfter OLTL‘s TV sign-off but before its web debut earlier this year, several of the daytime drama’s characters migrated to ABC’s General Hospital. During that time, two of them — Cole and Hope Thornhart — were killed in a car accident. The Prospect Park suit alleges that the characters were temporarily on loan to ABC (so that the actors could keep working), and that the network sabotaged the online endeavor by playing Grim Reaper.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of unexpected challenges plaguing both soaps’ inaugural online seasons. First, claiming that viewers were overwhelmed, Prospect Park cut the weekly installments from four to two per series… which earned fans’ ire, anyway. Then, both shows went on hiatus earlier than planned due to a (now resolved) labor dispute.\n\nBoth dramas recently wrapped their first online seasons. Prospect Park boss Jeff Kwatinez tells the Times production on a new bunch of AMC episodes will begin this month."
