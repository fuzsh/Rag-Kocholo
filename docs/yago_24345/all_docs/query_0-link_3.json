        "text": "As a rebellious teen, Brooke came to Pine Valley to be raised by her rich aunt. Under Aunt Phoebe's watchful eye, Brooke grew into a responsible young woman, became a reporter and met and married Tom Cudahy. They became the parents of a daughter, Laura, who was later tragically killed by a drunk driver. Brooke was shattered and Tom became an alcoholic, leaving the marriage. Brooke found some relief when she gave birth to Jamie, fathered by Tad Martin. They have maintained a strong friendship for the sake of their son.\n\nThe string of men in Brooke's life looks like a list of those discarded by Erica Kane, and Brooke is frequently reminded of that by Erica and none too kindly. After Tad, Brooke had a brief relationship with a reclusive artist, that ended when his former love returned and reclaimed his heart. She found solace in her adolescent adopted daughter, also named Laura.\n\nOn a return flight from New York, accompanied by Edmund, Maria and Maddie Grey, the plane crashed and all aboard were killed except Edmund, Maddie, Brooke and a man named, Jim. Being a reporter, Brooke teamed with him to try to determine why the plane had crashed, and discovered he had known Laura in the past and had taken pornographic pictures of her. As Brooke and Jim's relationship deepened, she eventually realized he was only after her money and had been instrumental in the plane crash. When she confronted him with evidence, they argued, and she shot him. She was exonerated at a later trial. (Only in soap operas can you get away with murder.)\n\nBrooke busied herself in community service, had a brief fling with Dimitri Marick, and then fell for Revered Eliot Freeman. She turned him away when she later learned that he had assumed a new name and was really the man behind the wheel when her darling Laura was killed.\n\nWorking with Edmund at Tempo Magazine brought him and Brooke closer together, and eventually the two became engaged. Their marriage was destined for happiness until Brooke spied a woman she believed to be Maria Grey. When Maureen Gorman's memory returned, Brooke confessed that she had known that Maria was alive for some time, and Brooke's marriage with Edmund was annulled allowing him to reunite with Maria. Brooke fell into Adam Chandler's bed and swore him to secrecy, but Jamie found out. It didn't last because Brooke still loved Edmund.\n\nBrooke's relationships were put on the back burner when Jamie became involved with JR Chandler's wife, Babe, and believed he might be the father of the baby she carried. To Brooke's relief the child was JR's. Her joy was short-lived as Edmund was found dead in a barn at Wildwind and she discovered she, rather than Maria, had been named executor of his will.\n\nBrooke, always with a good heart, looked after the needs of Edmund's children, and even took in Amanda Dillon, a past love of son, Jamie's, when Amanda's mother was found to be the responsible one for the blast at the masquerade ball. Brooke left town in December of 2006.\n\nBrooke returned to Pine Valley in March 2010 upon hearing that Tempo Magazine needed an Editor. She moved into the Chandler Mansion and supported the family as JR battled cancer. During this time her feelings for Adam resurfaced. She reunited with Adam and the two left town together.\n\nBrooke and Adam returned to Pine Valley in 2011 to help a troubled JR, who lost the mansion. Brooke bought the house for Adam with money from her inheritance from her Aunt Phoebe. While home, they discovered that David had been keeping Stuart alive. They threw a party at the mansion, where JR lurked and shot at someone."
