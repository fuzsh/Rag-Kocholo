        "text": "The Park\n\nSitting on the bench with a female client this morning, Tad was showing her evidence of what he found and discovered when it came to her faithless boyfriend. Pictures of her boyfriend with another woman, hanging out during some late nights at clubs and even some recordings of the phone call from her boyfriend to his mistress. All of that made her sad, frustrated and angry which Tad could not blame her for. Being 'Tad the Cad' back in those days made Tad regret the people he hurt such as Liza, Dixie and so on and forth. During those he was young and stupid as a young adult, but then even as an adult he was unfaithful at times too. Thank god Tad wasn't still doing that these days currently or Dixie would of really left Pine Valley and never come back. Finishing up his meeting with his client, he asked her if she wanted to keep what Tad investigated and just showed to her before she nodded her head. Handing over the evidence in a ziplock plastic bag before the two of them stood up. Shaking hands, she thanks Tad before leaving the park while Tad watches her, wondering what she's up to. He would not want to be in the guys shoes right now, but as Tad was about to leave, some guy bumped into him while he was running.\n\nTad - \"Hey, watch where you're going!\"\n\nThe guy stopped and turned around facing Tad, it was Aidan who slowly smiled a bit while Tad was shocked to see him. Aiden was dressed in a grey tank top, shorts and sneakers, looking all sweaty from his forehead.\n\nTad - \"A...Aiden? So the reports were true after all you were really released from prison\"\n\nAidan - \"Of course Tad, who did you expect to see?\"\n\nTad - \"No one actually, I was about to head back to the office, you know, the same old one we used to work in together. You should come by and check it out, say hello to the guys\"\n\nAidan - \"You, Jesse, your nephew and your other brother right?\"\n\nTad - \"Yeah, how did you know? Wait, don't tell me, you always keep tabs on certain people like me right?\"\n\nAidan - \"Sort of...my time in prison caused me a lot of time to think and reflect on what I did back then. The people I hurt and betrayed, but at least now I am back for the time being then I will leave town again\"\n\nTad - \"Sounds good, where are you staying right now?\"\n\nCarl - \"Aiden wait up!\"\n\nThe two men see but also hear Carl who was dressed in a tank top, shorts and sneakers too who was running before he stopped. Panting with his hands on his hips, Carl looks up at Aidan and Tad before he smiled, recognizing who the man with grey hair is.\n\nCarl - \"Oh, I am sorry, I hope I didn't mean to cut in between you two. You must be Tad Martin right?\"\n\nTad - \"Yes, that's correct and you are? Do we know each other?\"\n\nCarl - \"Well...let's just say that a man you're familiar with who's out of jail has told me a lot of about you. And nope, I am not talking about Aidan, the name's Carl by the way. I'm Robert Gardner's personal assistant, this guy over here is Robert's bodyguard\"\n\nTad - \"His what!?\"\n\nAiden rolled his eyes and sighed, wishing Carly hadn't had done that but after he was let out of prison, he knew right off the bat that the guy sometimes talks a big game. Carl nodded and grinned at the same time, glad to see that Tad who was just starting to process this news was shocked but slowly started to not be happy. The man who knew Aidan for all of these years since they first met, formed an investigation firm, a good friendship, Aidan goes to jail and THIS is how he repays Tad including his other friends he's back stabbed? He's now working for one of Tad and Jesse's most hateful enemies in the entire world alongside this other guy in Carl who Tad didn't know damn thing about. Aidan obviously didn't want it to come out that he was working with Gardner like this, but it wasn't like the spy to just do something, then move on. Oh no, that's not him at all, but how was he going to tell Tad of his plans with Carl with them. There was a lot Carl could not hear or know about Aidan's true intentions, what he didn't know actually as Tad continued to look at Aidan. He was still waiting on an explanation coming from the british spy himself, one that Aidan would have to explain to him clearly.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Hubbard Residence\n\nJust about there at his parents home, Frankie looks over at his wife and noticed her looking out the window, thinking, worrying herself about Henry. Frankie hated for her to go through something like this, where a man who used to remember Henry as his whore is now back from the so called dead to haunt her. Seeing him with Randi at the Fusion offices was shocking but also made Frankie uncomfortable for what could happen moving forward. At the end of the day he just wanted Randi to be safe and not worry about North, but Randi won't let that happen. She had every right to worry about what Henry may do, but what could Henry have that's so strong against Randi? Well for starters, the night when Henry 'died' and how Randi covered it up with Jesse. Now that's a powerful weapon to use against the Hubbards but this was going to cause Madison some exposure. Frankie wasn't going let to Henry get the best for them in this situation and there's William? He was never told the story of how Henry died, and now Henry could come after William too. Parking near where his parents live, Frankie and Randi get out as they walk up to the door together hand in hand before Frankie rings the door bell, then Angie opens it.\n\nAngie - *Smiles* \"Hey baby, what you brings you by? Your dad and I were about to leave for works, he's upstairs getting his things together\"\n\nFrankie - \"Morning mom, unfortunately this isn't a social visit or anything. We got to talk before you guys go, so I called Brot and Natalia to come over here too, it's very serious\"\n\nAngie - \"You called Brot and Natalia? Frankie, Randi, are the two of you in any trouble? Don't tell me one of you got into a fight\"\n\nRandi - \"It's better that we talk about it inside, it's very important Angie\"\n\nAngie - \"Um...okay then. Come in\"\n\nThe couple comes into the home after Angie steps out in the way, wondering what trouble the two were in this time. Angie loved her son but sometimes he would get into some of the most ridiculous things ever, even when he was a kid too. Walking down the stairs dressed for work, Jesse with his bag in his hand sees Frankie and Randi before he smiled.\n\nJesse - \"Hey Frankie, Randi, what a surprise this is I thought you guys would be at work already\"\n\nRandi - \"If someone by the name of Henry North hadn't come back, maybe we wouldn't be here this morning\"\n\nJesse arched his eyebrow as his ears perked hearing the name of Henry North. Jesse wasn't sure of what Randi spoke of at first but started to figure it out.\n\nJesse - \"Say what again? Did you just say Henry North? But he's-\"\n\nFrankie - \"Dead dad...we know... not anymore. He came to the Fusion offices last night to spook and provoke Randi. I'm just glad I was there so that punk would not hurt my wife\"\n\nAngie - \"Are you sure he's alive? Like, not dead dead?\"\n\nRandi - \"Yes Angie, I saw him with my own two eyes. It was like he had soul left in him and he just wanted his revenge right then there...he looked so demonic and angry\"\n\nJesse - *Sighs* \"Great...just what we need. First Gardner and now North is back, what the hell were we thinking of covering up?\"\n\nAngie - \"Oh gee Jesse, you think? This could come back and bite you two on the ass, you should at least been honest\"\n\nThe doorbell rings again so Angie walks up to the door to answer it. When she stops, Angie looks back at Jesse, Randi and Frankie putting her hand on her lips.\n\nAngie - \"I'll answer it, that must be Brot and Natalia but if not you guys need to be quiet, don't talk so loud okay?\n\nRandi - \"What if Henry exposes everything we did? And what about Madison? He might come after her next, she needs to know\"\n\nFrankie - \"If she's working today at Fusion you can let her know. She's going to be devastated but also surprised to see her\"\n\nRandi - \"She will be but I bet you won't be shocked to find out that I am pregnant with your child\"\n\nFrankie, Jesse and Angie - \"You're what!?\"\n\nNatalia - \"You're pregnant with Frankie's kid! This is so great!\"\n\nComing into the house with Brot after Angie opened the door for them, Natalia hugged Randi in excitement that she was going to be an aunt again. Angie, Brot, Frankie and Jesse were all stunned to hear the unexpected news of Randi's pregnancy but the only thing was, now Frankie had to look out for their soon to be child that will come into the world at some point. He could even see it on her face that she was scared of the outcome of what could happen. What if Henry tried to kidnap her and cut the baby out of soon to be grown womb that has her baby in it? Okay, maybe Randi was over thinking things but the man was unpredictable. Henry could have many connections all he wanted to and with one word he could tell them what he wanted, then it was done. When Randi was Henry's whore, while waiting for him in bed she could hear the private conversations by him raising his voice at whoever including Madison when something went wrong. If Randi stayed with Henry would it have been either good or bad? Maybe a bit of both but mostly bad since Henry was powerful and could do whatever he wanted. Now that he's returned, nothing could get in Henry's way again.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTempo Magazine\n\nBrooke English, the managing editor and CEO of Tempo Magazine, was at her desk going over some of the stories and articles that were submitted to her online through e-mail. Her phone had rang before she picked it up and heard her adopted daughter in Laura's voice. The day Adam died was the most saddest day for her, finding him in bed on the morning of it and he wasn't responding. EMT's came and took him to the hospital but it was already too late, he was pronounced dead when Angie told her what happened. Adam's heart gave out and even if he had surgery beforehand for a heart transplant it wouldn't have worked. Since Adam's death, Brooke has done her best to move forward from running Tempo Magazine and bringing them back into the fold. In Adam's will once it was revealed to the Chandler family, not once did it say for any of his children or other relatives to run the company except for Brooke or the board of directors. So Brooke decided to step down as CEO of the company but still has a strong partnership with Chandler Enterprises since Tempo was an affiliate for the company. Ending her call with Laura, Brooke continued to look into the articles that would be on the next issue of Tempo Magazine. Suddenly she felt a surging pain in her head that caused Broke to groan in annoyance. Before she knew it, the pain went away before a knock was heard on the door that caused her to look up, seeing Dimitri.\n\nDimitri - \"Hello Brooke\"\n\nBrooke - *Smiles a bit* \"Dimitri, this is a surprise. I expected my secretary to inform me of your arrival unless you swooned her away\"\n\nDimitri - \"Well your secretary went to the bathroom so I decided to sneak in in a bit and visit one of my old friends\"\n\nBrooke - \"Since you put it that way Dimitri, I guess I have some time to kill before going through articles takes most of my attention for the rest of the day\"\n\nDimitri - \"Or I could take you out for lunch and you could hold off on everything until you get back that is.\n\nToday is a beautiful day you know?\"\n\nBrooke arched her eyebrow and felt a little intrigued from Dimitri's offer. Since Adam's death, the man has been there by her side, but despite her not ready for a relationship, maybe this was Dimitri's chance of asking her out.\n\nBrooke - \"Trying to ask me out for lunch Dimitri?\"\n\nDimitri - \"Now I know what you're thinking Brooke, this isn't a date or anything, it's just...me being a good friend to you, that's all\"\n\nBrooke - \"Or maybe the count trying to sweep a red head like me off of her feet and asking her out on a date after that as well? Right \"\n\nDimitri chuckled. Brooke, despite her appearance and her rapport as a reporter, businesswoman, etc, she wasn't dumb and can figure people out in a heartbeat. That was one of the reasons the man fell so in love with Brooke, she was such an accomplished lady, so beautiful in every way.\n\nDimitri - \"Brooke, like I said this isn't a date, it's just me being a friend. We can at least sit down, eat, catch up and have a good time\"\n\nSam - \"You should take him up on his offer Brooke. Knowing my uncle over here, he really is a charming man when it comes to the ladies\"\n\nDimitri - \"What the...?\"\n\nBrooke - \"Sam\"\n\nDimitri turned around and Brooke looked over Dimitri to see Samuel Grey leaning against the doorway with a smile on his face. Dimitri and Brooke did not see this coming as Brooke immediately gets up before hugging the young man tightly catching Sam off guard a bit but he couldn't blame her. She was just glad to have Sam back, as Dimitri watched on and smiled, glad to see Sam too but he didn't see this coming as well. Julia was back at Wildwind trying to get everything of her life back together and focusing on healing after being on the run so many times over the years, but Sam didn't know that much about Julia actually being alive, hiding from the Dragon. At some point Dimitri had to tell Samuel the truth about Julia but also about his father too who's in recovery, though still in a coma. It was going to be a lot to get through but he hoped Sam understood the reason why his uncle and his mom did what had to be done. Maria also knew about his father's fate and didn't tell her children, her son and her daughter Maddie who's being kept in the dark too. Dimitri didn't want to keep secrets from his nephew who's like a son to him. Edmund would not want Dimitri to shun out Sam from learning everything about the truth.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Park\n\nAiden caught himself in kind of a pickle here thanks to Carl's big mouth as Tad stared at him, waiting for an answer. From the look on Tad's face, Aidan knows he's let Tad down but this wasn't the first time you know? The second time he let Tad down was when Tad confronted Aidan when he was on the run with Kendall. Him showing up at the shack unannounced was something Aidan didn't see coming, but he could tell Tad was worried and wondered why his friend was acting so strong. Looking back before Aidan was about to kill Kendall, maybe he could of opened up to Tad on what's going on, that way Aidan could of thought twice about his potential killing of Kendall before calling Zach and letting him handle everything else. Someone other than Aidan could of took care of Kendall, she wouldn't have nearly suffered because of the man she thought was her friend. Carl on the other hand watched both Aidan and Tad, waiting for one of them to speak as well before he started to do some stretching himself. Maybe the guy was going to eavesdrop but it wouldn't hurt to know all about Tad Martin. Carl never knew anything about Aidan's friend or anyone in the town for that mattet except a couple people like Jesse, Angie, etc.\n\nAidan - \"Um...Carl, you mind giving us a minute?\"\n\nCarl - \"Of course Aidan, take all the time you need. Just don't expect me to let you easy for the rest of our son, I will be over here continuing to stretch. Nice to meet you Tad\"\n\nIgnoring him, Tad showed a fake smile before Carl moved to the side and continuing to stretch while Aidan clears his throat to get his attention\n\nAidan - \"Alright Tad, I know what you're thinking, it's not what you think it is though\"\n\nTad - \"How so? And who the hell is that Carl guy? Is he one of Robert's goons?\"\n\nAidan - \"He's an assistant for Robert and handles everything. He may look like some armature but Carl is not slouch Tad\n\nTad - \"What about you? Are you a slouch? Are you starting to fall off the cliff because from what I just heard, you allowed Robert to buy your soul\"\n\nAidan - \"It's not what you think Tad, I just need the money from him. Then i'll be on my merry way Thaddeus. That way, you and Pine Valley don't have to worry about me for long\"\n\nTad - \"So, you're not staying in Pine Valley?\"\n\nAidan - \"Long term? No but when I have enough then I will make my exit, you really think I want to stay in this rubbish town?\"\n\nTad - \"At first no, I can see it in your eyes that you want to be done with Pine Valley. But what about Kendall? There's many people like her you let down Aidan, she was one of them\"\n\nAidan - \"Did I let you down Tad? You were there before all of it happened, I was surprised you didn't come to your good senses to prevent me from doing the unthinkable to Kendall\"\n\nTad - \"Because I thought you knew better Aidan, something was off about you that day when I showed up. From what I can tell something was off and you weren't yourself. Let's say I refused to leave, would you have killed me?\"\n\nAidan frowned and looked down on the floor briefly. Tad's question hit Aidan right in the gut, it was like Tad didn't know who Aidan was anymore and that hurt, because the Aidan he remembers knows his friend would not do that.\n\nAidan - \"No, I wouldn't but you would have been taken out. You wouldn't have died Tad, I told you I had it all covered\"\n\nTad - \"But you didn't and you could of killed Kendall. Don't even tell me it's because of Greenlee because she would never approve anything like that. Kendall was her friend, almost like a sister, how do you think-\"\n\nAidan - \"Enough Tad, enough alright? I don't need the guilt trip, okay? Your buddy messed up but there's nothing I can do to erase it, it's done\"\n\nTad - \"That's true but at least you can make it up to her. She was in an incident in Paris, France the other night and wasn't found\"\n\nAidan looked shocked. Aidan never heard of this before, especially when he came to the mansion the first night, just wanting to rest and take it easy.\n\nAidan - \"She was involved in an incident?\"\n\nTad - \"Yeah, some guy in a truck crashed into her as her car went off the road. Ian and Spike are okay but they may need surgery due to their injuries\"\n\nAidan - \"I had no idea Tad...what about Kendall?\"\n\nTad - \"They haven't found her so I sent Adrian to Erica, Jackson, Ryan and Zach in Paris. They could use an extra hand Aidan...but it's up to you\"\n\nAidan - \"I need to continue my run Tad, it was good talking to you\"\n\nTad - \"Just...just be careful when it comes to Robert, he's a dangerous man and will turn on you when you don't expect it. Watch out for Carl too\"\n\nAidan - \"Don't worry...\"\n\nAidan was about to leave, then puts his hand on his shoulder whispering in Tad's ear. Tad didn't know what he was going to say to him but at least he needed to hear the guy out.\n\nAidan - \"I have a plan...see you later\"\n\nAidan catches up with Carl before they continue their run through the park which made Tad curious of the last thing the spy said to him. Obviously it hinted that Aidan wasn't really working for Robert because of the money and other things, he was also trying to see what dirt comes out of it. Right from the jump Aidan knew Robert was up to no good, even when he's working with the FBI, he wasn't on the right side. He was going to use his corruption and connections to get what he wanted. Though as long as Aidan stayed in the clear and at least pretend to act like he's affiliated with Robert then he should be fine. Then there's Carl, Aidan didn't know how much he tried to listen to when Aidan was speaking to Tad. But maybe he could of picked up some of the conversations but to Aidan's non surprise Carl did at least get some of what they spoke of. Carl was no suspicious of Aidan but he wasn't going to pull the rug out from him now. Robert had to know too just in case they were actually dealing with a traitor on their team. Tad watches on before he walks away, hoping Aidan had a plan or at least something when it comes to Robert. Aidan was there the night when Robert tried to take Angie so this should not happen but for now, the man was on a mission to get the goods on Gardner so he had to stay with him.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Hubbard Residence\n\nExplaining everything to Natalia and Brot about Henry's return, Randi and Frankie made sure to not miss any other detail. Jesse and Angie heard everything again when it comes to the former district attorney, it felt so nauseating for them to go through this again. Jesse always viewed North as a hot shot, a punk who wanted to show he was tough and takes a bite out of crime but the one weakness he had was not understanding or loving anyone enough. That's how Madison felt, as she told the Hubbard family how Henry didn't love her enough, only seeing her as some kind of trophy, some object while he gets satisfaction from someone else like Randi or the next woman he found attractive too. Angie was worried of how this could bite them all in the end, heck, she may faces charges for being an accessory since Angie knew. But she had fait that the good lord would help them and protect them from any danger. Robert Gardner, Henry North, who's next? They weren't wishing for any of them who are a threat, but it may be a taste of what's to come. Brot and Natalia listened to everything before Frankie and Randy finished explaining the situation.\n\nNatalia - \"Well...that's not good\"\n\nBrot - \"I agree...with Henry coming back, he can blow this thing sky high. Also, he could sue you AND Jesse for the cover up Randi\"\n\nFrankie - \"That's it? Henry is a threat to my wife, we don't know what he's going to do next so that's all? Come on guys\"\n\nNatalia - \"Frankie, were just trying to be realistic. North might come after you, but the man doesn't need to use a weapon or a gun to kill you two. Henry has the law on his side for this one, he'll use all his resources of what's available\"\n\nRandi - \"Great, and it could be over for all us. Here I am pregnant and could go to jail on what happened to Henry\"\n\nFrankie cups her face with his own hands as a hopeless Randi looks up at her husband's eyes that she could never get enough of.\n\nFrankie - \"Hey, look at me, don't talk like that okay Randi? We'll find a way to get out of this, I promise\"\n\nAngie - \"Wait, I think I got an idea. How about you talk to him Randi?\"\n\nRandi - \"Me?\"\n\nFrankie - \"Not a snowball's chance in hell mom, are you kidding?!\"\n\nAngie - \"Listen to me, if Randi talks to Henry privately and convinces him to drop everything then that's that, right?\"\n\nFrankie - \"And what if that man says no and comes after me, all of you? What are you guys going to do? We can't take this laying down\"\n\nJesse - \"You're mother makes a good point Franklin. I think Randi can pull it off ,but if you're going to be there for her you can't act like a hot head\"\n\nBrot - \"Yeah, he's right Frankie. Besides, do you want me or your sister to arrest you and take you down to station? That is if you assault North, that's something you don't want man\"\n\nFrankie - \"Brot, you know me. I don't care about North or anything he wants from us. We just want him to leave Randi and us alone for good\"\n\nRandi - \"You know what Frankie, Jesse's right, we'll talk to him together but you have to cool it okay? The last thing we need is our child's father in jail\"\n\nFrankie - \"I'll cool it Randi but I swear, if that man lays a hand on you, touches you inappropriately...I will kill him\"\n\nAngie - \"Frankie! Don't say that!\"\n\nNatalia - \"And also don't forget, were still cops. We need to do our jobs if you bust Henry up out of the blue\"\n\nBrot - \"She's right man, don't mess this up okay? Randi and our soon to be nephew or niece need their dad in one piece when the birth takes place\"\n\nFrankie - \"You're right, I am sorry guys, alright? I just want to make sure Randi and my unborn child are safe, William too\"\n\nJesse - \"He's another one you need to talk too about this Frankie, don't forget\"\n\nRandi - \"And Madison, she has to know as well. When I see her at the offices for Fusion we'll talk, but we better get a move on Frankie, I don't want to be late\"\n\nFrankie - \"Same here, but we'll leave this up to you Randi to figure out with Madison. Let's go baby\"\n\nAngie - \"I'll see you at the hospital Frankie and please stay out of trouble okay? I love you\"\n\nJesse - \"I love you too son\"\n\nFrankie hugs his mom and dad before Randi hugs his parents as they along with Natalia and Brot leave the house. Jesse and Angie grab their things before they leave to follow the others, as for the soon to be grandparents, all they wanted was for their children to be happy, successful but also become good parents too. There were so many times where Jesse and Angie could of done better for Frankie despite doing the best they could, then Angie and Jacob raising Frankie and Cassandra after Jesse. But what matters is that their children were going to be okay right? Henry North was nothing to them, just some guy who was trying to act all hot shot and throw his weight around. North didn't scare any of them, he was no boggie man or definitely a monster but Jesse felt like he wanted to investigate North's resurgence. Someone on the outside had to bring North in and make sure to provide him what he needs to know. Could it have been Gardner this entire time? Shaking his head before he waved goodbye at Angie as he watched her leave, Jesse had to go to Tad and Charlie for his help on this one. A lot of things didn't add up but maybe paying Robert a visit to his mansion unannounced wouldn't hurt, right?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTempo Magazine\n\nAfter hugging Brooke, Sam hugged his uncle Dimitri who he hasn't seen a long time either. Sam blamed himself for not keeping up the contact with other relatives in his family that much, but Dimitri can understand Sam's a grown man. He's been going to college in Berkeley, California and just graduated too so from what Maria told Dimitri once when they visited Edmund, she mentioned Sam working as an intern for newspapers, etc. It didn't surprise Dimitri, Sam was his own man and following in the footsteps of his father that he missed so much unless the count could tell him right here, right now. That would require that Sam or Brooke to not tell anyone until the coast was clear, this wasn't the right time. Dimitri didn't want to ruin the moment between all three of them, even when the man hasn't seen his nephew in such a long time. Of course, Sam would be furious of finding out the truth but Dimitri hoped he understood the reasoning. The safety of their families were on the line which includes the safety of Sam himself. Letting go of Dimitri, he looks over Sam and places his hand on her shoulders as he smiled at his nephew. He looked so much like Edmund to him.\n\nDimitri - \"Welcome home Sam, now this is something I didn't expect at all\"\n\nSam - \"Took you two by surprise huh? Maybe I should do that more often\"\n\nBrooke - \"When did you get back?\"\n\nSam - \"A couple of minutes ago before landing in Pine Valley from a long flight. Feeling rested and settled, I thought coming by my dad's old stomping grounds for a visit would be okay\"\n\nBrooke - \"Of course it is Sam, it's so good to see you. Are you staying in town for the time being?\"\n\nSam - \"Actually indefinitely\"\n\nDimitri - \"You mean...\"\n\nSam - \"Yes uncle Dimitri, i'll be staying in Pine Valley for the long haul. Now before you two ask I will be staying at the dorms for PVU until I graduate\"\n\nBrooke - \"Oh Sam, this is great news! So just to be sure, you're attending PVU?\"\n\nSam - \"You got that right Brooke, I am transferring from Los Angeles University since there's more I need to know more about my roots here\"\n\nDimitri - \"Well that's uh...great to hear Sam. Whenever you want to come by at Wildwind you just let me know\"\n\nSam - \"Of course uncle Dimitri, it's been too long since I was there the last time. I bet the place has changed a lot\"\n\nDimitri - \"Not quite, I mean yes, returning to Wildwind and looking around the entire home needed some moving around including adjustments to make it look real nice. You'll be impressed\"\n\nSam - \"Sounds great, can't wait to see the place but I don't want to intrude on you or anything else. Hopefully you understand\"\n\nDimitri - \"Thank you Sam, just don't be afraid to come to Wildwind okay? You've always family to me Sam\"\n\nBrooke - \"And if you need anything from me too, don't hesitate, just ask Sam. Your father did so much for me back then, so I want to do the same for you\"\n\nSam - \"Actually, I was wondering if I could intern here at Tempo magazine for the time being while attending college\"\n\nBrooke and Dimitri were surprised to hear Sam's question. Now this would make Edmund so proud to hear that his son wanted to work here if he was alive today.\n\nBrooke - \"Say no more Sam, you're in, we can talk about it some other time\"\n\nDimitri - \"Actually Brooke, if you don't mind maybe Sam would love to join us for lunch, just the three of us\"\n\nSam - \"Are you sure? It's not like me to intrude on any plans you have with Brooke. I can wait another time\"\n\nBrooke - \"You know what, it's okay Sam, you can come with us. I'm sure we can catch up on all things going on in Pine Valley\"\n\nSam - \"That works for me, when do we leave?\"\n\nBrooke - \"We can go right now, let me get my tings and we'll be out the door\"\n\nBrooke did exactly that before she left her office with Dimitri and Sam, telling her receptionist to hold all calls until she gets back from lunch wherever that may be. Dimitri is a man of intrigue at the same time so where he would take Brooke and Sam to lunch was a surprise for both of them. Brooke welcome the distract, the visit but also going to lunch when feeling her head hurt before Dimitri came into the office that she never felt before. Maybe it's the long hours of stress she has put in for Tempo since Adam died, despite visiting Jamie and calling Laura front time to time. She could take a break at some point but there was so much more she could do. Jamie would tell his mother right off the bat to get rest and time off from Tempo, but at the end of the day it's Brooke's call to make. Dimitri, as he leads Brooke and Sam to his limo, thinks of what to do now that Sam was back in town. Yes, he was welcomed any time to come to Wildwind but Julia's safety mattered too. Maybe once Dimitri came home by himself and spoke to Julia, she would allow it. She didn't know about Edmund either so that was another issue of itself since it's very complicated, Sam had the right to know everything when it comes to his father.\n\nEND OF EPISODE 9"
