Dr. Joe Martin succeeded Dr. Tylor to the Chief of Staff position. Even though Charles did divorce Phoebe, they still maintained a close relationship until his death.\n\n2. Did Phoebe ever battle alcoholism?\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\nShe did have a fight with the bottle but thankfully gave it up. Even though she became one with a drinking problem, Phoebe still managed to be a busybody in Pine Valley, scheming against various people like Amy Tyler, Kelly Cole, Mona Kane Tyler, and more. However, she always held a soft spot for her niece, Brooke English.\n\n3. Linc Tyler returned to whose funeral in 2005?\n\nAnswer: Phoebe Wallingford\n\nLinc came back to pay his final respects to his mother, Phoebe. Many other notable people from Phoebe's past paid a visit to the ceremony, like Chuck Tyler (Charles Tyler II), Kelly Cole, Benny Sago, and Tom Cudahy. The funeral consisted of Pine Valley residents reading some notes left by Phoebe in the case of her death.\n\nThese notes returned back to her past interactions with the many characters of \"All My Children.\"\n\n4. Which of these groups was Phoebe Tyler a member of while she was in Pine Valley?\n\nAnswer: Daughters of Fine Lineage\n\nNot only was Phoebe a member of Daughters of Fine Lineage but she was also part of the Pine Valley Historical Society.

How much money did Phoebe offer Eddie Dorrance to marry Kelly Cole?\n\nAnswer: $50,000\n\nShe paid him a whopping $50,000 to wed Kelly, but Kelly and Eddie never made it down the aisle.
