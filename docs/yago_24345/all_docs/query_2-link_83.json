Sort of like magical online shop with extremely fast shipping and delivery all attached to your body.\n\nOutfit ・ (view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]\n\n━━ 𝐏 𝐄 𝐑 𝐒 𝐎 𝐍 𝐀 𝐋 𝐈 𝐓 𝐘 ━━\n\nCyril is a reserved and introverted individual‬ who prefers to keep to himself, such as reading or writing alone and researching history. He struggles with anxiety that has overcame him for a majority of his early teenage years. He is highly soft-spoken and struggles with speaking and standing up for himself. Although he is passionate about standing up for and defending those who are vulnerable to being oppressed. He is fiercely loyal to his friends which in turns render him sometime vulnerable to betrayal. He is optimistic while naive which causes him to always see the goods in everyone even when he has been betrayed and taken advantage of. He is an easily forgiving person and wishes for only peace in the world. He is also extremely observing and calculative, thanks to his quiet nature that he is able to easily blend into the background and observe his surroundings to his advantage. However, this gives him a cold and stoic image that sometimes causes anyone who doesn’t know him to deem him as unapproachable, even though he is always happy to help whenever approached. Beneath his exterior, he is just a softie who want to be free to loved and be loved and cared for.\n\n━━ 𝐇 𝐈 𝐒 𝐓 𝐎 𝐑 𝐘 ━━\n\nCyril was born and raised in Vienna, Austria before moving to live in Tokyo, Japan and Marseille, France (his father’s home country) at 4 and 6 years old. His father is of Nigerian-French descent while his mother is of Egyptian-Japanese-Native American descent. He and his family eventually moved to live in the US permanently when Cyril was 7 and his twin younger siblings were born. His magical ability manifested around the first time of his arrival to the US. Even though it has manifested in him at such a young age, no one has ever taken notice of it due to the fact that his parent were constantly occupied with works and strange occurrences only ever happening coincidentally whenever no one is paying attention on him. This might’ve been his early ability to sub-consciously control his magic which indicates his massive magical potential. As he grew up, Cyril had always regarded his strange ability as a normality, although he understood that it must be kept only to himself. A number of incidents that happened in his early teenage years which almost exposed his ability sparked a severe anxiety disorder which caused to him to desire to be overlooked in fear of doing the wrong thing and thus exposing his secret. Consequentially, Cyril also involved himself with modern-day witchcraft for a period of time. This is also what sparked his interest in researching into the witch trials in the past. As he dove further into the subject, he discovered his family’s ancestry and learned that a pair of his ancestors were accused of witchcraft and persecuted during one of the early European witch trial. However, this doesn’t necessarily explain his magical ability considering that his ancestors might’ve also just been innocent victims to the trial. It wasn’t until the first time he witnessed the world of Greek mythology in real life, in which he saw a battle between some monsters and demigods as a result of him manipulating the Mist that obscured it, that he began to suspect his true lineage. He manipulated the Mist in order to reach Camp Half-Blood and demigods. Through their helps and his own, Cyril learned of his true ancestry. Cyril is a many generations legacy of the goddess Hecate. His accused witches ancestors were truly demigods and children of Hecate, therefore capable of performing real magic. This magical lineage had slowly faded and became muddled ever since from generations to generations until almost non-existent to the point that the family even has no recollection of ancestors who were involved with the early European witch trials. Magic has almost completely vanished from the bloodline, Cyril is the first in many generations and centuries to be born with full magical abilities. Staying at the camp, the Hecate’s cabin allowed Cyril to stay with them. Although, his magical ability are still not at an impressive level, with proper trainings and experiences, he has the potential to become a powerful magic wielded, even stronger than Hecate’s direct children themselves and many powerful sorcerers in history.\n\n━━ 𝐑 𝐄 𝐋 𝐀 𝐓 𝐈 𝐎 𝐍 𝐒 𝐇 𝐈 𝐏 𝐒 ━━\n\n‪FAMILY ・\n\nFather ・ De'Andre Adetokunbo\n\nMother ・ Velvet Johnson\n\nSiblings ・ Jethro Adetokunbo (brother), Vivienne Adetokunbo (sister)\n\nLOVE INTERESTS ・\n\nMarshall McSporran (enbyfriend)\n\nOrfeus Blood-Moon (boyfriend)\n\n━━ 𝐎 𝐓 𝐇 𝐄 𝐑 ━━\n\n‪Strongest Skills ・ Magic, Knives throwing, Historical knowledge\n\nWeakest Skills ・ Socialising\n\nFacts(s) ・\n\n・He can speak English, French, German and conversational Japanese.\n\n[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\n━━ 𝐍 𝐀 𝐌 𝐄 ━━\n\nO r f e u s | R o b i n | L e a n d e r | B l o o d - M o o n\n\nOrfeus | ・ | the darkness of night\n\nRobin | ・ | bright fame\n\nLeander | ・ | lion-man\n\nBlood | ・ | son of Lloyd\n\nMoon | ・ | writing\n\n━━ 𝐁 𝐀 𝐒 𝐈 𝐂 - 𝐈 𝐍 𝐅 𝐎 𝐒 ━━\n\n1 7 | T r a n s - M a l e | H o m o s e x u a l / P a n s e x u a l\n\nAge ・ 17\n\nGender ・ Trans Male\n\nPronoun(s) ・ He/Him\n\nSexuality ・ Homosexual/Pansexual\n\nGodly Parent ・ Iris, blessed by Apollo\n\nBirthday ・ 16th June ; Gemini\n\nYears at Camp ・ 3\n\nNationality ・ American/Canadian/Korean\n\n━━ 𝐏 𝐑 𝐄 𝐅 𝐄 𝐑 𝐑 𝐄 𝐃 - 𝐖 𝐄 𝐀 𝐏 𝐎 𝐍 ━━\n\nCrossbow ・\n\nThis is able to not only shoot out normal arrows, but special arrows that can cause different effects, such as pure light, rainbow explosion and flames, etc. The arrows are followed by a trail of rainbow.

While he is sometimes easy-going and carefree and likes to goof around, he can also be quite serious and tough at times. He does not care much about others’ opinions just as long it does not get in his way and prefers to get along with everyone and goes with the flow. However, when he is in his serious mood, he jokes less and prefer to focus on getting things done as he is quite a committed and determined person. He always keep his promise and fulfils any duty that is required of him no matter the circumstance. He is still just a sweet and caring guy who is always nice to everyone and can easily understand and relate to someone. Orfeus is quite secretive though, believing that others don’t have to deal with his business and does not struggle to keep secrets if he sees that it is necessary. Sometimes he can be a bit too cunning and loses himself in employing any mean to get his way. He is energetic which fuels his impulsive nature. He is not very good at thinking before doing something which gets him to quite some troubles. Although, he considers courageous and not afraid of many things which further fuels his impulsiveness. Despite sometimes causing troubles, he is still responsible and reliable. He is determine to fix any trouble that he has caused and can be depend upon by anyone he is close with for help. He always try to keep every situation cheerful and light no matter what trouble he is stuck in which affects how sometimes he doesn’t grasp a bad situation.\n\n━━ 𝐇 𝐈 𝐒 𝐓 𝐎 𝐑 𝐘 ━━\n\nOrfeus was born in Vancouver, Canada but raised in Incheon, South Korea until middle grade. From birth, he was blessed by Apollo, as Orfeus is actually the reincarnation of Hyacinth, Apollo’s male lover. He had a good childhood with loving and supportive parent and a close relationship with his step-family, being raised alongside them. He realised his gender identity at a young age but has kept it a secret for most of his childhood. After moving back to Canada, he finally came out to his parent at age 12 and met with supports and acceptance from both his father and step-father. He has a close relationship with all of his adopted triplet half-siblings. He began transitioning the following year. Unfortunately, he was bullied at school during the process which caused his family to have to move many times and eventually even across countries. He made very little friends due to this reason. However, during the transitioning process is when he first connected with his birth mother, the goddess Iris who appeared in astral form, disguised as dreams, offering him helpful advices but he still didn’t know that he is a demigod. He also started social media pages that grew in popularity, sharing his everyday life and interests. He also developed an interest in makeup and drag. Problems began to appear during his teenage years when monsters began attacking not only him but his family. Iris appeared to him again and revealed to him that he is a demigod. He was told to go to Camp Half-Blood which he eventually decided to go in order to protect not only him but his family. He utilised one of his demigod gift of illusion to help convince his parent. Orfeus is incredibly proud of his identity, he considers himself unapologeticaly queer, and has used his platforms to spread important awareness for what he stands for. He is very passionate about standing up for the LGBT+ community and is not having any of intolerance, close-mindedness, ignorance or hatefulness. Sometimes he attends Pride Parades and uses his gift as a child of the goddess of literally rainbow to spice up the events.

She is a no nonsense type of person. She doesn’t like to mess around and prefer to perform her tasks and duties well. Being a hundred years old biologically and spending most of her times in the wild with her fellow hunters, she is quite old-fashioned and out-dated and doesn’t quite modern humour. This makes her seem to be even more of a stern person because she isn’t quite able to grasp a light-hearted environment. She is incredibly passionate about things that she care about and is fiercely loyal and protective. She will go to extreme means to ensure the safety of those that she cares about which makes her very self-less, always willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of others. She hates betrayal more than anything in the world, especially to ones that she cares about. Her loyalty makes her extremely trustworthy and reliable about her, many people finds it easy to share their struggles with her. Although her fierce loyalty makes her prone to being taken advantage, those that betrays her better be ready because she will not let them get away with it and will ensure that they will be taught a lesson and never undermine her again. She used to despise men, having live for so long surrounded by mostly women, for their toxic masculinity and the way the society is constructed patriarchally. However, Hortense has learned to become more comfortable with some men, mostly those who are actually nice. She fully supports feminism and strongly believes that women are fully capable of anything, she is passionate about empowering other women to express their confidence and independence.\n\n━━ 𝐇 𝐈 𝐒 𝐓 𝐎 𝐑 𝐘 ━━\n\nHortense was born in the 1900s on her mother’s island. Her mother is Circe who imprisoned her father for many years on her island. Her father was a Japanese immigrant and emigrated to the United States and worked as a sailor. During one of his work duties out in the sea, his boat was lost among the sea and they stumbled upon Circe’s island. Her father and the other men that were on the boat were then imprisoned the island. Soon afterwards, her father formed a romantic relationship with Circe who later became pregnant with Hortense. At three years old, her father was released and moved away from the island, leaving Hortense to live her mother. Growing up on the island, Hortense learned many powerful magical abilities personally from her mother, alongside her other apprentices. Despite the magical lessons that she received from her mother, they had a rough relationship, Hortense wasn’t exactly close with her mother and they often argued. Hortense sometimes even disapprove of Circe’s actions as she grew older. At twelve years old, Hortense finally was able to find a way to escape from the island, she snuck onto a boat that was planning to leave the island. Upon arriving to the United States, she was homeless for many months and struggled severely to adapt to the new environment. She was not accustomed to the way of living of the other people not on the island. She got herself into many troubles by using magic which she eventually learned to conceal from mortals. While away from her island, she also planned to look for her parent, eventually she was able to find him, only to find out that he actually already had a family even prior to him arriving on the island. She also found out she had two half-siblings. Her father allowed to stay with his family for a few month before Hortense realised that she wasn’t exactly welcomed and ran away again to live on the street. While homeless and starving, she met with the goddess Artemis and her hunters at the age of 15. The goddess found out her background, took pity on her and offered her to join her hunters which Hortense gladly accepted and she was immortalised. She was a hunter for a very long time, traveling to many places alongside them and learning many useful skills to survive. She was fiercely loyal to the goddess and became one of the most skilful hunter. Many years later, she finally came to a hard decision to give up her immortality for a mortal life in order to experience normal things because she realised she have spent sufficient times to repay her gratitude to the goddess. For a faithful duties, Artemis peacefully granted her wish. As a mortal, she remained 15 years old in appearance and moved to Japan to connect with her cultural heritage. Eventually, she moved back to America and decided to live in Camp Half-Blood.\n\n━━ 𝐑 𝐄 𝐋 𝐀 𝐓 𝐈 𝐎 𝐍 𝐒 𝐇 𝐈 𝐏 𝐒 ━━\n\nFAMILY ・\n\nFather ・ Tomoya “Thomas” Kinomoto\n\nHalf-siblings ・ Reo Kinomoto (brother), Sakura “Cherryline” Kinomoto (sister)\n\nLOVE INTERESTS ・\n\nImmaculata Makepeace (girlfriend)\n\n━━ 𝐎 𝐓 𝐇 𝐄 𝐑 ━━\n\nStrongest Skills ・ Magic, Hunting, Hand-to-hand combat, Martial art\n\nWeakest Skills ・ Holding back her opinions\n\nFacts(s) ・\n\n・Se is currently studying Japanese.\n\n・She helps keep the Artemis cabin clean, despite not being a hunter anymore.\n\n・She has a gothic 20’s fashion sense."
