        "text": "01 of 25\n\nSusan Lucci as Erica Kane\n\nWhile many characters came and went in the 41 years All My Children aired, Susan Lucci’s Erica Kane was a mainstay through and through. In fact, the actress got her big break on the show in 1970!\n\n\"I loved Erica Kane from the moment I read my first audition scene, and I will always love her. She made me feel like I can fly,\" Lucci said of her iconic role per PEOPLE's All My Children special edition issue.\n\nWhile playing Erica was her main gig up until the show wrapped in 2011 — earning her 21 Daytime Emmy nominations and one win — she landed other roles over the years including a few appearances on Dallas, an episode of That’s So Raven and in 1998 she starred in Annie Get Your Gun on Broadway. Since the show ended, Lucci has continued to act, appearing on Army Wives, Hot in Cleveland and all four seasons of Devious Maids. In 2008, Lucci also placed six on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nEven longer than her role on All My Children was her marriage to late-husband Helmut Huber who died in 2022 at the age of 84. Lucci is mom to two adult children, Andreas Huber and Liza Huber, and also a proud grandma.\n\n02 of 25\n\nDavid Canary as Adam and Stuart Chandler\n\nWhen David Canary stepped into the roles of twins Adam and Stuart Chandler on All My Children in 1989, he was no stranger to television. In the late 1960s, he appeared on Peyton Place and later landed roles on both the big and small screen including Bonanza, The Doctors and Another World.\n\nOf his roles on AMC, which Canary won five Daytime Emmys for, he said \"It was hard work. I loved both of them very much. If there were long periods when Stuart wasn't around, I missed him desperately.\" Per IMDB, his last billed role was in 2013 when the show was briefly revived as a web series.\n\nCanary died in 2015 at the age of 77, per The New York Times.\n\n03 of 25\n\nMichael E. Knight as Tad Martin\n\nMichael E. Knight’s role as Tad Martin on All My Children, was one of the actor’s very first onscreen gigs right out of acting school. Knight appeared in the role for decades and earned three Daytime Emmy awards along the way before reprising it on the short-lived All My Children reboot in 2013. Though his tenure in the AMC universe might have come to a close, his career in soaps was far from over as he has since appeared on The Young and the Restless and more recently, General Hospital.\n\n04 of 25\n\nCameron Mathison as Ryan Lavery\n\nWhen Cameron Mathison joined the AMC family in 1998, he had just a few onscreen roles under his belt. As Ryan Lavery, Mathison’s character was a part of one of the series’ famously elaborate weddings when he married Esta TerBlanche’s Gillian Andrassy in 2001. Throughout the show Ryan also had romances with Alicia Minshew's Kendall Hart and wedded Rebecca Budig's Greenlee Smythe.\n\nAfter the show wrapped, the roles kept coming for Mathison who appeared on series like Desperate Housewives, Drop Dead Diva, Hot in Cleveland and an array of TV movies. In 2021, he landed another recurring soap spot on General Hospital.\n\nThe actor and his wife, Vanessa Mathison, are parents to one son, Lucas, and a daughter named Leila. In 2019, the actor underwent surgery to treat kidney cancer. \"The tumor is gone and I even got to keep 80% of my kidney 😊,\" he wrote on Instagram following the procedure.\n\n05 of 25\n\nRebecca Budig as Greenlee Smythe\n\nJust a few years before beginning her years-long tenure as Greenlee Smythe on All My Children in the late 1990s, Rebecca Budig began her stint on Guiding Light as Michelle Bauer.\n\nBudig’s soap career did not stop there. By 2014, she had landed the role of Hayden Barnes on General Hospital, whom she portrayed until 2021. Her most recent film credit came in 2022’s Fit for Christmas with Amanda Kloots.\n\n06 of 25\n\nWalt Willey as Jackson Montgomery\n\nWalt Wiley joined the AMC cast in 1987 as Jackson Montgomery and remained a mainstay throughout the show's run. Since the show, Wiley has continued to act appearing on the series Tainted Dreams from 2014 to 2017 and most recently, reprised his role as Montgomery on General Hospital in 2023.\n\n07 of 25\n\nAlicia Minshew as Kendall Hart\n\nAlicia Minshew had only been in the industry a few years when she landed what would become a near decade-long stint as Kendall Hart, Erica Kane’s daughter, on All My Children in 2002. Like many of her costars, Minshew appeared on the 2013 web series as well as series like Beacon Hill, Tainted Dreams, The Blacklist and her most recent credit, per IMDB, is an episode of Eltingville in 2021.\n\nMinshew welcomed daughter Willow in 2009 with her husband, Richie Herschenfeld.\n\n08 of 25\n\nMark Consuelos as Mateo Santos Jr.\n\nWhen Mark Consuelos auditioned for All My Children in 1995, he left with more than a role — he also met his future wife! Consuelos landed the role of Mateo Santos Jr. — the love interest of Kelly Ripa’s Hayley Vaughan — and stayed in the role for more than a decade. While still appearing on the series, he took other roles in shows like 1-800-Missing, Hope & Faith and an episode of Ugly Betty.\n\nSince the show has wrapped, Consuelos has continued to act, appearing on shows like American Horror Story, Alpha House, Pitch, The Night Shift, Only Murders in the Building — as Selena’ Gomez’s dad — and Riverdale, in which he recurred from 2017 to 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Consuelos replaced Ryan Seacrest in his role as cohost on Live with Kelly and Ryan and now hosts Live with Kelly and Mark with Ripa — his wife of more than 27 years. The two are parents to three children: Michael, Lola and Joaquin.\n\n09 of 25\n\nKelly Ripa as Hayley Vaughan\n\nKelly Ripa’s big break came in 1990 when she landed the role of Hayley Vaughan — a character she would portray for two decades. During that time, Ripa landed roles outside of the show including one of the titular characters in Hope & Faith from 2003 to 2006.\n\nSince All My Children, Ripa has had her fair share of guest spots on television shows, often appearing as herself, on series like Hannah Montana, 30 Rock, Broad City and Nashville. In 2019, she even made a special cameo on Riverdale alongside her husband. Of course, her longest-running gig outside of AMC has been as morning show host, first on Live! With Regis and Kelly starting in 2001. The gig turned into Live with Kelly and Ryan and is now Live with Kelly and Mark.\n\n10 of 25\n\nJill Larson as Opal Cortlandt\n\nAfter starting out in the industry in the early 1970s, Jill Larson stepped into the role of Opal on All My Children in 1989 and carried it through the end of the series. During her time on the show, Larson landed other roles including Were the World Mine and Shutter Island.\n\nLarson reprised her role on the 2013 reboot and appeared on shows like The Young and the Restless, Vinyl and Hunters as well as films like The Taking of Deborah Logan, Forever, Christmas on Honeysuckle Lane and most recently, A Holiday I Do.\n\n11 of 25\n\nJames Mitchell as Palmer Cortlandt\n\nJames Mitchell already had a decades-spanning career in television, film and Broadway when he stepped into the role of wealthy businessman Palmer Cortlandt in 1979. He had appeared in films like 1949’s Colorado Territory, 1950’s The Toast of New Orleans and 1953’s The Band Wagon and several more before beginning his 30 year turn on the soap in a role that would ultimately be his last.\n\nMitchell died in 2010 at the age of 89, per the L.A. Times, just weeks after appearing on the show’s 40th anniversary episode.\n\n12 of 25\n\nEileen Herlie as Myrtle Fargate\n\nLike Mitchell, Eileen Herlie also had decades of experience on her résumé when she jumped into the role of Myrtle Fargate in 1976 which would earn her three Daytime Emmy nominations. She played Gertrude in 1948's Hamlet opposite Laurence Olivier and Jean Simmons and forged a Broadway and film career throughout the '50s and '60s. In 1960, Herlie earned a Tony nomination for her performance in Take Me Along.\n\nThe actress appeared on AMC until 2008, with her final performance coming just months before her death at age 90, per The New York Times.\n\n13 of 25\n\nJacob Young as J.R. Chandler\n\nBefore landing the role of J.R. Chandler in 2001, Jacob Young had already ventured into the world of soaps as Rick Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful, a role he played from 1997 to 2018, and Lucky Spencer on General Hospital in the early 2000s.\n\nIn the years since, Young has starred in TV movies and made appearances on shows like Beacon Hill, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series and The Walking Dead. His most recent screen credit, per IMDB, was in a short titled Prepare for Launch in 2022.\n\n14 of 25\n\nJulia Barr as Brooke English\n\nAfter appearing on several episodes of Ryan’s Hope in 1976, Julia Barr stepped into the role of Brooke English on All My Children in 1978 — a role she would play for decades to come. After the show ended in 2011, the Daytime Emmy-winner was one of the actors who reprised their roles on the 2013 reboot — her last onscreen credit.\n\n15 of 25\n\nThorsten Kaye as Zach Slater\n\nBefore playing Zach Slater on All My Children, Thorsten Kaye had acted in both movies and on TV, including a few episodes of One Life to Live in the late 1990s and a recurring part on Port Charles in the early aughts. Kaye appeared on AMC for several years and reprised his role in the 2013 reboot as well.\n\nHe appeared in the first two seasons of Smash and played Ridge Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful from 2012 to 2023.\n\nKaye shares two children with his wife, One Live to Live actress, Susan Haskell.\n\n16 of 25\n\nEva LaRue as Maria Santos Grey\n\nEva LaRue had been acting since the late 1980s, having scored a recurring role on Santa Barbara, before stepping into the part of Dr. Maria Santos Grey — a one-time love interest of Zach Slater — in 1993. LaRue appeared in various projects throughout the 1990s and early 2000s including episodes of Head Over Heels, Soul Food and George Lopez. In 2005 she began her seven-season stint as Natalia Boa Vista on CSI: Miami.
