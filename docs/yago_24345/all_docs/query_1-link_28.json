It would also be quite subjective, since everyone has favorites but not everyone has the same favorites.\n\nCarrie Fairchild\n\nTelly Talk Enthusiast\n\nLV\n\n3\n\nMessages\n\n2,313\n\nReaction score\n\n5,682\n\nAwards\n\n7\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Park West\n\nAug 25, 2023\n\n#3\n\nI’m going to throw in my two cents, from the perspective of an outsider looking in. As I mentioned on here before, US daytime soaps only aired sporadically in Ireland and the UK, so a lot of my knowledge of them came from what I’d read or heard elsewhere before they gradually became more accessible via the internet. So my opinions of who was a “big name” as such, often came from the star’s profiles and reputations or later fandom around their characters. There’s some that probably deserve a mention but have been forgotten in the mists of time (Mary Stuart for her run on Search for Tomorrow)\n\nSoap queens: Erica Kane, Marlena Evans\n\nSupercouples: Luke & Laura, Cruz & Eden\n\nFamilies: The Forresters (for remaining at the centre of B&B since it’s inception), The Spauldings\n\nGrande Dames: Katharine Chancellor, Beverlee McKinsey’s Alexandra Spaulding\n\nDaniel Avery\n\nAdmin\n\nLV\n\n6\n\nMessages\n\n7,812\n\nReaction score\n\n14,640\n\nAwards\n\n16\n\nLocation\n\nSunny South Florida\n\nMember Since\n\nJune 10, 2000\n\nAug 25, 2023\n\n#4\n\nFirst, I think we should settle on a list of the US daytime soaps worthy of note. I focus mainly on those that lasted at least five years, but a few with shorter runs that deserve mention. If I forgot someone, please remind me. Obviously not all of these were crazy-popular, so there will be greater attention paid to some than others, and the older shows likely will suffer since fewer of us have seen them.\n\nAll My Children\n\nAnother World\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nCapitol\n\nThe City (about 1.5 yrs.)\n\nDark Shadows\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nThe Doctors\n\nThe Edge of Night\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nGuiding Light\n\nLoving\n\nLove of Life\n\nOne Life To Live\n\nPassions\n\nPort Charles\n\nRyan's Hope\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nSearch for Tomorrow\n\nThe Secret Storm\n\nSomerset\n\nSunset Beach\n\nTexas (2 yrs.)\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\ntommie\n\nTelly Talk Hero\n\nLV\n\n3\n\nMessages\n\n6,448\n\nReaction score\n\n9,394\n\nAwards\n\n9\n\nLocation\n\nSweden\n\nMember Since\n\nI dunno\n\nAug 25, 2023\n\n#5\n\nI mean, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) even got to do the voice-over for the Beyond Salem episodes, taking over from Macdonald Carey, so I think she has a status in this.\n\nWillie Oleson\n\nTelly Talk Schemer\n\nLV\n\n8\n\nMessages\n\n19,589\n\nReaction score\n\n34,307\n\nAwards\n\n22\n\nLocation\n\nPlotville, Shenanigan\n\nMember Since\n\nApril 2002\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#6\n\nI'm pretty sure that Sally Spectra was the most entertaining character in US daytime soap.

It's also a great name, isn't it?\n\nI had her on my grande dames list but took her off for some reason. She’s definitely one of the most colourful and is the only soap character to have a waxwork in Tussauds in Vegas & Amsterdam, so she definitely has icon status.\n\nDaniel Avery\n\nAdmin\n\nLV\n\n6\n\nMessages\n\n7,812\n\nReaction score\n\n14,640\n\nAwards\n\n16\n\nLocation\n\nSunny South Florida\n\nMember Since\n\nJune 10, 2000\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#8\n\nAll My Children\n\nAnother World\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nAMC:\n\nObviously most regard it as \"That show with Erica Kane\". It was a lot more than that, obviously, but she falls into the Top Character category and was part of some of the Top Couples, what with her multiple marriages. Other notable characters include Adam Chandler, Tad Martin, Joe Martin, Kendall Hart, Phoebe Wallingford, Brooke English, Angie Hubbard and Dixie Cooney. Popular couples include Erica/Jackson, Erica/Travis, but also Jenny/Greg, Brooke/Adam, Jesse/Angie, Tad/Dixie, Leo/Greenlee, and Stuart/Marian. Some of their core families are the Martins (probably their \"top\" core family), the Cortlandts, the Montgomerys, and the Tylers.\n\n(I didn't watch this show regularly, so I'm sure I missed some other popular names...feel free to add on.)\n\nAW:\n\nThis was \"my\" soap, my all-time favorite so I might have to stop myself from writing a list thirty feet long.\n\nNotable characters include Rachel Davis Cory, Iris Carrington, Felicia Gallant, Vicky Hudson, Donna Love, Liz Matthews, Alice Frame, Mackenzie \"Mac\" Cory, Russ Matthews, Jake McKinnon, Steve Frame, Jamie Frame, Carl Hutchins, and Cass Winthrop. Popular couples include Mac/Rachel, Alice/Steve, Jake/Paulina, Donna/Michael, Vicky/Ryan, Sally/Catlin, Cass/Kathleen, and Sam/Amanda. Their prominent core families include the Matthews family, the Corys, the Hudsons, the Loves, the Frames, and McKinnons.\n\nATWT:\n\nNotable characters on this show include Bob Hughes, Tom Hughes, John Dixon, Holden Snyder, James Stenbeck, Kim Hughes, Barbara Ryan, Lisa Hughes Grimaldi, Lily Snyder, Lucinda Walsh, Carly Tenney, and Margo Hughes. Popular couples include Kim/Bob, Holden/Lily, Margo/Tom, Carly/Jack, Luke/Noah, and Steve/Betsy. The Hughes family reigned supreme on this show from Day One, though there were also the Snyders, the Montgomerys, the Stewarts, and Grimaldis.\n\nDallasFanForever\n\nTelly Talk Supreme\n\nLV\n\n5\n\nMessages\n\n21,563\n\nReaction score\n\n37,517\n\nAwards\n\n17\n\nLocation\n\nBethpage, NY\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#9\n\nI guess there are really no wrong answers for these questions, as it all pretty much comes down to preference and which shows we were a fan of more than others.\n\nFor me, it all starts with the families. The Abbotts and Newmans (Y&R), the Forresters, Logans and Spencers (B&B), the Lewis’s and the Shaynes (GL) were all among my favorite daytime families.\n\nMy favorite characters would include Victor Newman, Jack Abbott, Caroline Spencer Forrester, Ridge Forrester, Roger Thorpe, Erica Kane and Reva Shayne.\n\nFor couples, and this is the toughest one, among my favorites back then were Lauren & Paul (Y&R), Taylor & Ridge (B&B), Reva & Kyle (GL), Mindy & Roger (GL), Eric & Stephanie (B&B), Tracy & Brad (Y&R), and Nikki & Victor (Y&R).\n\nI feel like I’m leaving out so many more that I’d like to mention on all three topics but I’m sure as this thread moves on I’ll keep thinking of more.\n\nDallasFanForever\n\nTelly Talk Supreme\n\nLV\n\n5\n\nMessages\n\n21,563\n\nReaction score\n\n37,517\n\nAwards\n\n17\n\nLocation\n\nBethpage, NY\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#10\n\nI'm pretty sure that Sally Spectra was the most entertaining character in US daytime soap. It's also a great name, isn't it?\n\nFor me, the most underrated actress on daytime back then. She was quite the show stealer. There was no bigger event than a Sally Spectra-Stephanie Forrester scene. It always meant something when their paths intersected, and the show was very smart to keep them apart sometimes for months at a time without any interaction. It made their feud mean so much more.\n\nDaniel Avery\n\nAdmin\n\nLV\n\n6\n\nMessages\n\n7,812\n\nReaction score\n\n14,640\n\nAwards\n\n16\n\nLocation\n\nSunny South Florida\n\nMember Since\n\nJune 10, 2000\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#11\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nCapitol\n\nThe City (about 1.5 yrs.)\n\nB&B:\n\nSome of the major characters I recall are Eric Forrester, Thorne Forrester, Ridge Forrester, Bill Spencer, Jr., Stephanie Forrester, Brooke Logan, Taylor Hayes, Sally Spectra, and Macy Alexander. I'm sure @Emelee has other favorites, but I admit I haven't watched B&B closely over the years. Some of the most prominent couples are of course Brooke/Ridge and Ridge/Taylor, Thorne/Macy, Stephanie/Eric, and (heheh) Eric/Sheila. The Forresters and Logans have always been the central, core families.\n\nCapitol:\n\nThe show only lasted ~5years, so the key characters mostly remained throughout its run: Sam Clegg, Trey Clegg, Tyler McCandless, Mark Denning, Sloane Denning, Myrna Clegg, Clarissa McCandless, and Julie Clegg. Their main couple initially was Julie/Tyler, but we also had Sam/Myrna, Brenda/Wally, Clarissa/Mark, and Sloane/Trey. The three core families were the Cleggs, McCandlesses, and Dennings.\n\nThe City:\n\nIt was a spin-off of Loving, so it was mix of characters that relocated from the old show, and some newly-created characters just for this show. Sydney Chase was the central character at first, but since it only lasted a year and a half, there were no real breakout characters and even Sydney left at one point. The characters were mostly unrelated to one another, so there were no \"core families,\" and I cannot recall a single \"popular couple\" to come out of this series. They had borrowed characters and couples from other soaps---not just Loving, but from AMC (Angie Hubbard) and GH (Tracy Quartermaine).\n\ntommie\n\nTelly Talk Hero\n\nLV\n\n3\n\nMessages\n\n6,448\n\nReaction score\n\n9,394\n\nAwards\n\n9\n\nLocation\n\nSweden\n\nMember Since\n\nI dunno\n\nAug 26, 2023\n\n#12\n\nOh yes, The City actually aired in Sweden as I'm sure @Emelee and @Karin Schill remembers.

What a horrible show beneath Morgan!\n\nYeah. I think when it was known that Morgan was leaving, they phased Tracy Quatermaine in to take over from Sydney, with the two characters sharing the screen briefly. It had such a short run, I don’t think The City generated any legendary characters (IMO). There were good actors on the show but no characters that would necessarily be regarded as legendary today (not including already established characters from GH or AMC)\n\nkcmimichar\n\nTelly Talk Fan\n\nLV\n\n0\n\nMessages\n\n319\n\nReaction score\n\n852\n\nAwards\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\nU.S.A.\n\nFavourite Movie\n\nChinatown\n\nAug 27, 2023\n\n#18\n\nIt was really an effort to save Loving.

Its lead character in the early years was Victoria Winters, though other notable characters included Barnabas Collins, Dr. Julia Hoffman, Quentin Collins and Angelique Bouchard. The series featured time travel plotlines where actors played the ancestors of their present-day characters, so one actor might have played five or more different characters over the course of the series. The Collins family was the only core family, as the mansion was called Collinwood and the town, Collinsport. Prominent couples across all time periods included Barnabas/Josette, Barnabas/Julia, Maggie/Joe, Quentin/Beth, and Carolyn/Chris, though romance was not as important to the series overall.\n\nDOOL:\n\nProminent characters include Tom Horton, Roman Brady, Mickey Horton, Stefano DiMera, Steve \"Patch\" Johnson, John Black, Victor Kiriakis, Alice Horton, Maggie Horton, Marlena Evans, Kristen Blake, Kayla Brady, Kim Donovan, Jennifer Devereaux, and Laura Horton. Days specialized in 'supercouples' for decades, with such couples as Roman/Marlena, Kim/Shane, Bo/Hope, Patch/Kayla, Jack/Jennifer, and Justin/Adrienne. There were also the early favorites like Tom/Alice, Mickey/Maggie, and Marlena/Don. Core families included the Hortons, the Bradys, the DiMeras, the Kiriakis family, and the Johnsons.\n\nThe Doctors:\n\nProminent characters included Dr. Matt Powers, Dr. Nick Bellini, Dr. Steve Aldrich, Toni Ferra, Carolee Simpson, Nola Dancy, Penny Davis, and Dr. Althea Davis. Popular couples included Nick/Althea, Toni/Mike, Maggie/Matt, and Jason/Nola. Two other \"prominent couples\" worthy of mention were husband/wife teams who wrote the show at certain points: Richard and Esther Shapiro; and Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock. Both couples also later wrote for Dynasty. Since The Doctors was much more focused on the workplace than home life, it did not have any prominent families that I can recall other than the Aldriches.\n\nLast edited: Aug 29, 2023"
