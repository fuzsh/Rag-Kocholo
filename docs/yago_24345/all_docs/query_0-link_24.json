        "text": "Part 2 of 3....\n\nALL MY CHILDREN THROUGH THE YEARS: 1980 - 1989\n\nOver the course of 25 years, ALL MY CHILDREN has had a rich and fascinating\n\nhistory. Here are some highlights from the past 1/4 century.\n\n1980\n\nALL MY CHILDREN's second decade began in disaster for Erica Kane when\n\nbusiness at her disco, named Erica's, dwindled suddenly upon the opening of a\n\nhot new competitor, the Steam Pit. Customers stayed away from Erica's in\n\ndroves, and the final blow came when the city rezoned the area, forbidding\n\nErica to play music after midnight. Alone and despairing, Erica was forced\n\nto close the disco, but the inimitable Erica didn't languish in defeat for\n\nlong. She failed at Hollywood stardom, but met cosmetics magnate Brandon\n\nKingsley, who offered her a top modeling job, which she accepted behind Tom's\n\nback. When he discovered her latest deception, Tom called a halt to their\n\nmarriage once and for all and headed to the Caribbean for a quickie divorce.\n\nDespite Erica's machinations to keep them apart, Tom made plans to marry his\n\nnew love, Brooke English.\n\nPalmer attempted another scheme to keep Cliff and Nina apart when he falsely\n\ninformed his daughter that she was losing her sight due to a hopeless\n\ncondition related to her diabetes. Palmer convinced Nina to return her\n\nengagement ring to Cliff, who turned to nurse Sybil Thorne for comfort.\n\nCliff was ripe for seduction. And Sybil knew how to manipulate a man. They\n\nmade love.\n\nNina underwent a successful procedure to restore her lost vision and happily\n\nreconciled with Cliff. They married at Cortlandt Manor, but the damage was\n\ndone. Sybil was pregnant. Cliff broke the news to his new bride as gently\n\nas he could. But Nina reacted hysterically, and spurred on by Palmer, left\n\nCliff and returned to Corltandt Manor.\n\nKelly Cole was convicted and sentenced to death row for the murder of her\n\nmanager, Eddie Dorrance, but was released from jail when Lincoln Tyler's\n\npainstaking investigation revealed the real killer to be Claudette\n\nMontgomery, who, while trying to flee, was critically injured in a car crash.\n\nAs Claudette's life slipped away, Linc convinced her to confess her guilt.\n\nBilly Clyde Tuggle escaped from prison, then drugged and raped his wife,\n\nEstelle, and planned to bury her alive in a cemetery with her new love, Benny\n\nSago. Chuck Tyler heroically overpowered Billy Clyde and rescued his dear\n\nfriends. Benny presented Estelle with an engagement ring, but their\n\nhappiness was marred when Estelle learned she was pregnant with Billy Clyde's\n\nchild. Benny convinced a reluctant Estelle to marry him, and they agreed to\n\ntell everyone that Benny was the father of the baby.\n\nDonna Tyler failed in her efforts to buy a black-market baby, and frustrated\n\nby her inability to give Chuck a child, she left him. Donna fell under the\n\nspell of Palmer, who convinced the impressionable young woman to move in with\n\nhim at Cortlandt Manor and obtain a speedy Caribbean divorce from Chuck.\n\n1981\n\nFor many Pine Valley residents, 1981 was a year filled with anguish and\n\nsorrow. Paul Martin and the Tylers grieved when their beloved Ann was blown\n\nto bits by a bomb that was really meant for her political candidate husband.\n\nBrooke made the horrifying discovery that the woman she believed to be her\n\nmother, Peg English, was actually code-named Cobra, the leader of an\n\ninternational drug cartel.\n\nNina's friend, Monique Jonville, convinced Nina to reconcile with Cliff.\n\nSybil Thorne gave birth to Cliff's baby, and Palmer paid her not to give the\n\nchild up for adoption. Cliff found Sybil dying from a gunshot wound. On her\n\ndeathbed, Sybil implicated Cliff, who was arrested for murder. Cliff's hopes\n\nlooked dim as he stood trial for the crime. Monique Jonville came forward\n\nto confess on the stand that she knew the murderer -- Tom Cudahy's no-good\n\nbrother, Sean. In the process, she shocked the court by revealing that she\n\nwas Nina's not-so-dead mother, Daisy.\n\nWith his world collapsing around him, Palmer went on a drinking binge, was\n\nmugged, and suffered a complete loss of memory. Palmer Cortlandt, one of the\n\nworld's wealthiest men, went to work as a busboy at Foxy's, a Center City\n\nbar! Upon recovering, Palmer returned to Cortlandt Manor -- determined to\n\nwin back his first love, Daisy.\n\nUnder the influence of drugs, teenager Tad Martin smashed up the family\n\nstation wagon. Then, when the pressure of life at home proved too much, he\n\nran away. If he'd stayed in Pine Valley just a few months longer, Tad would\n\nhave met his real mother and his long-lost sister. In the summer of 1981,\n\nOpal Gardner, an outrageously wacky woman turned up on the Martin doorstep\n\nwith her sweet and innocent teenage daughter, Jenny. Jenny, a girl from the\n\nwrong side of the tracks, instantly fell in love with Greg Nelson, the\n\nclean-cut son of one of Pine Valley's leading families.\n\nErica was stunned to discover that her boss and lover, Brandon Kingsley, had\n\na full, complicated life that he hadn't clued her in on. Still, Erica had\n\nevery intention of marrying her man --- as soon as he agreed to divorce his\n\nwife, Sara. But Sara had no plans to give up her position as the one and\n\nonly \"Mrs. Brandon Kingsley.\" Brandon soon discovered that he had\n\ncompetition for Erica -- both privately and professionally. Kent Bogard, a\n\nhandsome young millionaire, and his father, Lars, tantalized Erica with an\n\nexciting offer to leave Sensuelle Cosmetics to become the spokesperson for an\n\nentire new line of cosmetics named after her!\n\n1982\n\nWhile honeymooning in Switzerland, Palmer and his new wife, Donna, met up\n\nwith Chuck Tyler and his new girlfriend, Melanie Sawyer. When a sudden storm\n\nthrust its way onto the mountain, Chuck and Donna took shelter in a cave,\n\nwhere they made love. Donna got pregnant and firmly believed the child was\n\nPalmer's. Daisy and Palmer knew better, because years earlier, Palmer had\n\nbeen rendered sterile in a polo accident. At year's end, Donna gave birth to\n\na son.\n\nJealous of Jenny's relationship with Greg, Liza Colby stunned Jenny with an\n\nincredible secret -- telling her that her father had been locked away for\n\nraping Ruth Martin four years earlier. Stunned by the horrifying truth,\n\nJenny paid a visit to her father in jail, and was so upset with the reality\n\nof the despicable nature of her family that she fled immediately for New\n\nYork. She spent an exciting summer with Frank Grant's streetwise nephew,\n\nJesse Hubbard, who was also on the run after Liza had falsely accused him of\n\nrape.\n\nThe battle for Erica's hand exploded at a New York restaurant when Brandon\n\nand Kent came to blows. Defeated in business, Brandon accepted a job in Hong\n\nKong and tried to convince Erica to come with him. Torn between her career\n\nand her love life, Erica made her decision when Lars Bogard offered her a\n\nstarring role in his new movie. Erica was finally going to become a\n\nHollywood legend! Brandon had finally had enough of Erica, and broke off\n\nwith her for good, reconciling with his wife Sara.\n\nThe mysterious and mousy Silver Kane arrived on Erica's doorstep, claiming to\n\nbe her half-sister. Busy with her many pursuits, Erica allowed Silver to\n\nstay on with her as her assistant.\n\nDespondent over his dismissal from Pine Valley University, music professor\n\nMark Dalton distanced himself from his busy wife, Ellen, and behind her back,\n\nbegan an affair with a student, Pamela Kingsley. Ellen confronted Mark about\n\nthe affair, and when he admitted to it, she left him.\n\nNina and Cliff fought when her new career as a Cortlandt Electronics\n\nexecutive kept her away from her family. On the job, Nina became obsessed\n\nwith fellow exec, Steve Jacobi. When a giant storm hit Pine Valley, the two\n\nco-workers were stranded alone together at Cortlandt Manor. In front of a\n\nroaring fireplace, they eyed each other. Atop a bear-skin rug, they\n\nsuccumbed to their passion.\n\n1983\n\nThanks to evil Ray Gardner, 1983 started out with a bang! In his vengeful\n\nquest to get even with the Martins, Ray had set a bomb to go off at the\n\nstroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in the Martin basement. When he\n\nrealized that his daughter, Jenny, was in the house, Ray grabbed his\n\nexplosive device, ran out of the house, clutching the ticking time bomb to\n\nhis chest. In this uncharacteristically selfless act, Ray Gardner died when\n\nthe device detonated.\n\nTad Martin came home to his grateful family, who had worried about his\n\nwelfare in the months he wandered aimlessly around the country. Tad's\n\nparents, Joe and Ruth, noticed right away that their little boy had changed.\n\nThe road had toughened Tad. He was older, wiser, savvier. And sexy!\n\nCliff and Nina's marriage was very much on the rocks, as Nina continually\n\ndaydreamed about her sizzling sexual encounters with her handsome lover,\n\nSteve Jacobi. One day, Cliff, on an errand to Steve's apartment, stopped\n\nbefore knocking on his door when he overheard strange noises from inside. It\n\nwas Nina making love to Steve! Cliff returned home and coldly broke the news\n\nto Nina that he wanted a divorce. Within days, Cliff secured a Caribbean\n\ndivorce.\n\nSilver Kane revealed a shocking secret to Erica when she admitted that she\n\nwas having an affair with Erica's beau, Kent Bogard! Furious with her lover,\n\nErica confronted Kent at the Founders' Day Ball. Their argument picked up\n\nlater in Kent's hotel room. In a struggle, the gun Erica had given him for\n\nhis birthday discharged. Kent slumped to the floor. He was dead. Silver,\n\nwho had witnessed the accidental shooting, lied to the police, saying that\n\nErica had murdered Kent in cold blood. Erica was arrested and released into\n\nMona's custody. When she learned that there was no chance for an insanity\n\nplea, Erica ran, pausing long enough to disguise herself as a nun to attend\n\nKent's memorial service! Erica finally gained her freedom when Tad saw\n\nSilver's picture in the Bulletin and immediately recognized her as Connie\n\nWilkes, a grifter he had met in California. After Tad assisted in identifying\n\nSilver as an impostor, Erica was cleared of the charges against her. Connie\n\n\"Silver\" Wilkes was extradited to California where she ended up in prison.\n\nBut Erica paid a heavy price, too. Due to all the notoriety, Lars refused to\n\nresign her as An American Beauty, the spokesperson for his cosmetics company.\n\n1984\n\nAfter becoming paralyzed, Greg Nelson broke up with Jenny Gardner to spare\n\nher the burden of living with a cripple. When he eventually recovered, a\n\nstill-glum Greg believed he had lost Jenny to Tony Barclay. Unbeknownst to\n\nGreg, Jenny had written him a declaration of love, which Greg's mother, Enid,\n\nhad hidden. \"She loves me! Jenny loves me!\" stammered Greg when he finally\n\nread the tender note, barely able to contain his excitement. But this was\n\nJenny and Tony's wedding day! In a flash, Greg raced to the church, hoping\n\nand praying he could stop the ceremony. In unison, the heads of the stunned\n\nwedding guests lurched to the rear of the church, where Greg Nelson stood,\n\nwild-eyed, at the freshly opened doors. In a flash, he charged up the aisle,\n\npunched out Tony in the middle of the wedding ceremony, and convinced Jenny\n\nto take him back.\n\nTo the strains of their special song, Irving Berlin's \"Always,\" Jenny and\n\nGreg married on Valentine's Day. They joyously planned to have a baby.\n\nTony, however, plotted to kill Greg by rigging his jet-ski to explode. At\n\nthe last minute, though, Greg and Jenny switched jet-skis, and Jenny was\n\nkilled.\n\nMillionaire Adam Chandler secretly plotted to win the love of Erica Kane.\n\nFirst, he had to get her lover, Mike Roy, out of the picture! Adam knew that\n\nMike enjoyed writing, and that his special interest was Tibet. So, to\n\naccomplish his goal, Adam arranged to have Mike Roy sent on a book-writing\n\nassignment to that faraway land. The fact that Mike and Erica argued about\n\nhis leaving was icing on the cake. With Mike gone, Adam pulled out all the\n\nstops to claim his prize. Adam saw to it that Erica never knew that he was\n\nbehind Mike's departure. Angry and on the rebound, she married Adam and\n\nmoved into the Chandler mansion.\n\nErica grew highly suspicious when she began hearing eerie noises coming from\n\nthe west wing of the Chandler Mansion. Adam was obviously keeping a closely\n\nguarded secret. Finally, Erica found out the truth -- Adam had an identical\n\ntwin brother named Stuart!\n\nTad was secretly being paid by Edna Sago to date her daughter, Dottie, and\n\nthe young woman fell hard for him. Phoebe had taken Hillary, Langley\n\nWallingford's daughter by a former wife, under her wing. Tad fell in love\n\nwith college student Hillary. To hang on to Tad, Dottie threw away her birth\n\ncontrol pills and became pregnant. Dottie tried to get Tad to marry her, but\n\nhe was reluctant because of his love for Hillary. Tad did marry Dottie, but\n\nwhen she miscarried, she didn't tell Tad. Meanwhile, a friend of Tad's, Bob\n\nGeorgia, fell in love with Hillary.\n\nEllen and Ross, truly in love, married. Attending the wedding was Ross'\n\nhateful former wife, Cynthia Preston, who, on Palmer's invitation, moved into\n\nCortlandt Manor with her son, Andrew.\n\n1985\n\nTo test his wife Erica's affections, Adam faked his own death. Erica had\n\nrealized she was still in love with Mike and, after Adam's \"death,\" got\n\nengaged to Mike. When Adam reappeared alive, Erica was furious. If she\n\nreally wanted a divorce, Adam told Erica, she must choose between Adam's\n\nfortune and her love for Mike. She chose Mike.\n\nDaisy was arrested and brought to trial for the murder of sleazy Zach\n\nGrayson. She was convicted and sent to prison. Fortunately, her unjust\n\nimprisonment did not last long. Soon after Daisy's incarceration, Donna Beck\n\nTyler began to have strange nightmares and started to sleepwalk. Donna's\n\nfiance, Benny, found blackmail photos of Cynthia and Ross in Donna's closet\n\nand began to suspect that Donna knew more about this murder mystery than even\n\nshe was able to understand. Donna agreed to take truth serum, and under its\n\ninfluence, she remembered that she had indeed been at Zach's apartment the\n\nnight of the murder. She vividly recalled seeing a pocketbook with the\n\ninitial \"W\" on it, and shouted out that the killer was Marian Colby. (\"M\"\n\nlooks like \"W\" upside down.) Marion, Liza's mother, who had been sleeping\n\nwith Zach, confessed to the crime. Even though Marion claimed the murder\n\nwas self-defense, she was sent off to jail, but was released in record time\n\nfor providing certain \"favors\" to the prison warden.\n\nDonna's wedding to Benny was marred by a distressed and deeply disturbed\n\nNina, who mistakenly believed Donna was responsible for her mother Daisy's\n\nunhappiness. Secretly carrying a gun into the wedding, Nina tried to shoot\n\nDonna -- and missed! Obviously deranged, Nina was sent off to a mental\n\nhospital, where she regressed, believing she was a teenager again.\n\nErica took a job as editor of Tempo magazine. A handsome man named Jeremy\n\nHunter talked to Erica about doing some artwork for the magazine.\n\nUnbeknownst to Erica, Jeremy had been sent there from Tibet -- he was the\n\nmonk Mike had saved! The two were attracted and fell in love, but Jeremy was\n\nreluctant to make love because he had taken a holy vow of celibacy.\n\nAngie Hubbard was attending medical school and deeply committed to finishing\n\nin the top of her class. One of her professors, Dr. John Voight, a married\n\nman, tried to take advantage of Angie by suggesting that she could improve\n\nher grades and her standing by submitting to an affair with him. Angie,\n\nanguished by this dilemma, eventually reported the sexual harassment to her\n\nhospital superiors, resulting in Dr. Voight's dismissal.\n\nTragedy struck Pine Valley when beloved Kate Martin died peacefully in her\n\nsleep. She was deeply mourned by everyone, and eulogized by her son, Dr. Joe\n\nMartin.\n\n1986\n\nTo Erica's relief, Kantu, the Tibetan monk leader, released Jeremy from his\n\nholy vow of celibacy. For the first time, he was free to be with the woman\n\nhe loved without the overwhelming sense of guilt that had plagued him for\n\nmonths. Still, there was more trouble on the horizon for Pine Valley's most\n\npopular lovers. Though Natalie Hunter was married to Jeremy's father, Alex\n\nHunter, she cared for only one man -- Jeremy! And the last person she wanted\n\nto have him was Erica! To make matters worse for Natalie, she learned that\n\nshe was pregnant -- with Alex's child. After Alex's death, Natalie claimed\n\nthat a drunken Jeremy was the father of her unborn child! A stunned Jeremy\n\nfelt compelled to marry her, leaving Erica in the lurch. But not for long!\n\nErica and Jeremy continued their hot love affair in a secret apartment.\n\nCliff Warner's fiancee, Dr. Amy Stone, was tragically struck down by a\n\ndrunken driver. As Amy clung to life, Dr. Joe Martin called upon Pine Valley\n\nHospital's most skilled surgeon -- Cliff Warner! -- to try and save her life.\n\nCliff operated, but Amy's injuries were too massive. Her death devastated\n\nCliff. Fortunately, Nina was there to pick up the pieces of his shattered\n\nlife. After reuniting in Maine, Cliff and Nina became engaged to marry for\n\nthe third time.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, the guests gathered at the church for Tad Martin and\n\nHillary Wilson's wedding. But the groom failed to show up! That morning,\n\nrobbers had ransacked the local bank, with Tad inside, locking him and Robin\n\nMcCall in the vault. When the calamity was cleared up, Tad and Hillary were\n\nmarried in a simple ceremony at the Wallingford Mansion.\n\nA slick young con man named Wade Mathews, slithered into Pine Valley, setting\n\nhis sights on rich dowager, Phoebe Tyler Wallingford. In swift fashion, wily\n\nWade succeeded in splitting up Phoebe and Langley, then lured the former Mrs.\n\nWallingford to the Caribbean where, in a drunken stupor, she became his wife!\n\nBack in Pine Valley, Wade and his girlfriend Shelly plotted to poison Phoebe,\n\nbut the plan backfired when Shelley tumbled to her death down Phoebe's\n\nstaircase. When Phoebe was jailed, Wade started selling off Phoebe's\n\npossessions, but a newly released Phoebe discovered his treachery. Caught\n\nred-handed, Wade drugged Phoebe, and left her to die. Fortunately, Phoebe\n\nsurvived and Wade was apprehended -- as he tried to make his way out of town\n\ndressed as a woman!\n\n1987\n\nNina was devastated when Cliff was reported to have been shot and killed\n\nwhile delivering medical supplies to a war-torn South American country.\n\nHolding her grief inside, Nina headed to Martha's Vineyard to be alone with\n\nher memories of Cliff. Before long, her dear friend, Matt Connelly, arrived.\n\nIn Matt's comforting arms, Nina finally broke down, let out her grief, and\n\nthey made torrid love. To the surprise of her family, Nina returned to Pine\n\nValley as Mrs. Matt Connelly. To everyone's shock and surprise, Cliff turned\n\nup alive having been held prisoner by the rebel forces. Cliff and Nina\n\nenjoyed a romantic reunion, reaffirming their love with a night of passionate\n\nlove-making. Nina shared herself with Cliff, but couldn't bring herself to\n\nreveal that she had married Matt. Upon hearing the truth that his wife had\n\nmarried another man, Cliff stormed out on Nina.\n\nJesse Hubbard's old flame, Yvonne Caldwell, turned up in town nine months\n\npregnant, declaring that Jesse was the father of her child. But later,\n\nseeing the error of her ways, Yvonne called Angie and admitted she was lying.\n\nJesse went undercover, and discovered, as he had suspected, that \"Mr. Big\",\n\nthe leader of a baby-selling ring, was his very own father-in-law, Les\n\nBaxter! Angie arrived on the scene just in time to witness the horrifying\n\nsight of her husband holding a gun on her father! In the ensuing struggle,\n\nLes fell down a stairwell and died. Jesse received a commendation for his\n\nheroic efforts, but the reward was bittersweet. Angered by her husband's\n\ndeception, Angie left Jesse.\n\nErica spearheaded an \"intervention\" on her brother, Mark Dalton, who had\n\nbecome a cocaine addict. Alone in a room, Mark's loved ones pointed out all\n\nhis lies and deceits, swearing that they wouldn't have anything to do with\n\nhim anymore unless he sought professional help. About to be abandoned by\n\nthose he loved, Mark checked himself into a rehabilitation center.\n\nCindy Parker, a sweet and kind young widow in desperate need of a place to\n\nstay, arrived in Pine Valley with her young son, Scott, in tow. Cindy\n\naccepted Angie Hubbard's gracious offer to live in her house. Within days of\n\nher arrival, Cindy grew smitten with her son's art teacher, the kindly Stuart\n\nChandler.\n\nNatalie Hunter began -- and ended -- an affair with Ross Chandler. When\n\nRoss's marriage to Ellen ended because of it, and Natalie chose to marry\n\nPalmer Corltandt, Ross bitterly raped Natalie. Ross's adopted daughter,\n\nJulie, having heard Natalie's screams, fled Cortlandt Manor in tears. Ross\n\nstood trial and was sent to jail after making a last-minute confession.\n\nErica hoped that her new love, senatorial candidate Travis Montgomery, would\n\npropose to her. Caught up with his many business and political interests,\n\nTravis did not exactly have marriage on his mind. That situation changed\n\ndramatically when Erica became pregnant with his child.\n\n1988\n\nOn February 8, with Travis by her side, Erica gave birth to healthy baby\n\ngirl, Bianca, after a difficult pregnancy in which she was diagnosed with\n\ntoxemia. Tending to her every need, Travis gave Erica a wedding ring,\n\npromising to put it on her finger no matter what happened.\n\nThe romantic triangle of Cliff, Nina, and Matt grew ever more complicated\n\nwhen Nina became pregnant. Having slept with both Cliff and Matt, Nina\n\nrealized that either man could be the father of her unborn child. Believing\n\nthat she truly loved Matt, the pregnant Nina sadly divorced Cliff and left\n\ntown with her new man.\n\nAngie broke the sorrowful news to Cindy that she had AIDS. Stuart Chandler\n\nvowed to stand by the woman he loved. Cindy was harassed and nearly killed\n\nin a fire set by a vigilante group who wanted the young AIDS victim to leave\n\ntheir town. Cindy would have died in the fire had it not been for the heroic\n\nefforts of Adam Chandler's daughter, Skye, who was now married to Tom Cudahy.\n\nSkye raced into the burning fire and rescued Cindy, but having inhaled the\n\nnoxious smoke, she passed out and fell into a long coma. During this time,\n\nTom made the shocking discovery that his wife had been a member of the\n\nAIDS-fearing vigilantes, and it was she who arranged the fire, only to have\n\nsecond thoughts at the last moment. While Skye was in a coma, Tom turned to\n\nBarbara Montgomery for comfort.\n\nHaving served his time in prison for killing Sybil Thorne, Tom's wayward\n\nbrother, Sean, showed up in Pine Valley determined to start a new life.\n\n\"It's a new me, Tom,\" Sean promised his brother, but his money-grubbing ways\n\nquickly became apparent once again when he set his romantic sights on Cecily\n\nDavidson, whose bottomless trust fund made Sean salivate. Against the wishes\n\nof Cecily's meddling mother, Bitsy (who stubbornly insisted that a former\n\nconvict would not make a suitable husband for her daughter), Cecily agreed to\n\nmarry Sean. Unbeknownst to anyone, Bitsy wanted Sean all to herself. She\n\nhad even suggested to Sean that he dump Cecily and run away with her!\n\nStuart and Cindy married in a beautifully tender ceremony in which they\n\nrecited their own vows. Soon after, Cindy's weakening condition forced her to\n\ngo in and out of Pine Valley Hospital. With Stuart's support, Cindy bravely\n\nfought off the infections that ravaged her frail body, each time returning\n\nhome to resume as normal a life as she possibly could under such difficult\n\ncircumstances.\n\nAngry and distraught over Jeremy's love for Natalie, Silver Kane confronted\n\nNatalie in her apartment. In a struggle, Natalie's gun, which she used for\n\nprotection, discharged, and Silver fell to the floor -- dead.\n\nWith Natalie's help, Palmer Cortlandt dumped the body in a pond on his vast\n\nestate, and blackmailed Natalie into becoming his wife again. Later, Natalie\n\nwas cleared and married Jeremy, but Palmer was sent to jail for his role in\n\nthe cover-up.\n\nJesse Hubbard, now a police officer, was gunned down by a bullet meant for a\n\nslick and shady figure named John Remington. In her quest to avenge Jesse's\n\ndeath, an embittered and inconsolable Angie struck up a friendly relationship\n\nwith Remington.\n\nDixie Cooney and her brother, Will, left Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia, in\n\nsearch of Pete Cooney, their late mother's rich brother. Pete turned out to\n\nbe Palmer Cortlandt, who hired Dixie as a maid for Cortlandt Manor, not\n\nknowing that she was his niece.\n\nStrapped for money, a desperate Travis concocted a phony kidnapping plot in\n\nwhich his insurance company would pay 15 million dollars for his safe return.\n\nWhen the plot backfired, his accomplice, Steven Andrews, hell bent on\n\nrevenge, snatched Bianca and demanded 15 million dollars all for himself.\n\nTravis was able to get Bianca back, but in the process, he lost his wife.\n\n1989\n\nCliff Warner and Angie Hubbard got engaged, but while they were planning the\n\nwedding, Nina returned to town. Soon, Cliff and Nina discovered what they\n\nalways suspected - Michael was Cliff's, not Matt's, son. The ordeal\n\nshattered Nina's marriage to Matt, but it did have a greater purpose. It\n\nbrought the former sweethearts together again for a fourth marriage, and they\n\nleft to start a new life in Denver.\n\nAdam Chandler married Brooke English, but slept with the family nanny, Dixie\n\nCooney, upon learning that Brooke was sterile and could not give him a male\n\nheir. When her baby boy was born, Dixie refused to give the child to Adam.\n\nBrooke packed her bags, and Adam persuaded Dixie to marry him. In part two\n\nof his sinister master plan, Adam attempted to drive Dixie insane, and get\n\nher committed to a mental institution. If all went well, Adam, Jr., would be\n\nAdam's alone. Fortunately, Tad saved the day when he realized what Adam was\n\nup to, and helped Dixie escape from the hospital. Armed with a Caribbean\n\ndivorce, Dixie married Tad.\n\nIn February, 1989, Cindy Chandler lost her valiant fight with AIDS. Stuart\n\ndedicated an AIDS quilt in her memory and promised to raise her son, Scott,\n\nwith love and care.\n\nDiscovering he had a life-threatening brain tumor, Travis left town to have\n\nan operation, informing his loved ones he was having a mid-life crisis.\n\nWhat Travis didn't know at the time was that Barbara was pregnant with his\n\nchild. Continuing to keep her pregnancy a secret from Travis, Barbara\n\nMontgomery married Tom Cudahy, and midway through their wedding ceremony, she\n\nwent into labor.
