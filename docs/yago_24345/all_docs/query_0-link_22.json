        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Which of these women was only married once on \"AMC\"?\n\nAnswer: Ruth Martin\n\nNumerous marriages took place on the show during its 41 plus year inception but Ruth Martin was one of few long running characters who only married once. She and Joe Martin tied the knot in 1972 and remained married throughout \"AMC\" from that point onward. While Ruth had a previous husband named Ted Brent, they married before \"AMC\" began.\n\n2. Whereas this character had two rough pregnancies, only one of them resulted in an elective abortion. Who?\n\nAnswer: Brooke English\n\nBrooke had a total of three children while on the show: Laura Cudahy (with Tom Cudahy), Jamie Martin (with Tad Martin) and Laura Kirk English (she adopted her). However, she might have had two additional kids if the pregnancies boded in her favor. In the late 1970s, Brooke was impregnated by Eddie Dorrance via a sexual assault.\n\nShe ended up aborting this baby so as to escape those emotional scars. In 1994, she wound up with an ectopic pregnancy that nearly killed her. Luckily, the doctor ended up saving Brooke's life.\n\n3. While Erica Kane has held many jobs, one of them involved an unusual occupation for the world renowned philanthropist: waitress. She waited tables in Sea City after kidnapping whom?\n\nAnswer: Bianca Montgomery\n\nErica became upset when Travis made some unscrupulous decisions and wanted to harm him. To do this, she kidnapped their newborn daughter, Bianca, and headed to Sea City where she got a job as a waitress. Eventually, Erica and Bianca returned to Pine Valley but her marriage to Travis ended a short while later.\n\n4. This woman had only one daughter and one granddaughter: Rae Cummings and Skye Chandler. Who?\n\nAnswer: Myrtle Fargate\n\nIn early 2000, Rae Cummings was in Pine Valley trying to figure out where her husband, Daniel, was located. While there, she learned that Myrtle Fargate was her mother and, despite initially being at odds, held a great relationship. On\"General Hospital\", it was revealed that Rae's daughter was Skye Chandler and therefore Skye was Myrtle's granddaughter.\n\n5. Janet Green committed numerous crimes in town. However, she only trapped a woman once in a church basement during Trevor and Laurel's wedding. Who?\n\nAnswer: Kendall Hart\n\nJanet fooled many people throughout 1994 when she returned to town under an assumed identity. As a result, Trevor sued for full custody of Amanda and won, thus angering Janet. To retaliate, Janet wanted to kill Trevor at his wedding to Laurel (she also had plans to murder Laurel) but Kendall attempted to stop her. To get rid of this distraction, Janet trapped Kendall in the church basement at the facility where the wedding took place.\n\n6. As a lawyer, Trevor Dillon represented numerous clients but only one of them filed a civil lawsuit against the school board. Who?\n\nAnswer: Michael Delaney\n\nTrevor initially worked as a police officer in Pine Valley but then wound up practicing law. For all his cases in Pine Valley, they involved a criminal issue with the exception of one. In this particular case, Trevor represented Michael Delaney when he sued the Pine Valley School Board after they terminated him due to his homosexuality.\n\nDespite the toughness of this action, Trevor and Michael were successful in their suit.\n\n7. Which of these characters had one job as a waiter at Foxy's in the early 1980s?\n\nAnswer: Jesse Hubbard\n\nJesse came to town in 1981 as a young African American man born and raised on the wrong side of the tracks. His first job in Pine Valley ended up being as a waiter at a sleazy establishment called Foxy's. Jesse would go onto work in the restaurant business for a couple more years in the 1980s before finding his true niche: police work.\n\n8. Tad Martin was known to have a sly side to him. However, he only once fabricated evidence to get which person acquitted in a murder trial?\n\nAnswer: Brooke English\n\nTad hated seeing the mother of his son, Brooke, be on trial for murdering a sleazy pornographer turned terrorist, Jim Thomasen. To cement doubt into the jury's minds, he doctored crucial evidence to persuade them to find her not guilty. Sure enough, Brooke was not sentenced to a prison term.\n\n9. David Hayward was known to be one of the world's brightest medical minds. However, only one time did he give someone an unapproved drug after this person threatened him. Which person?\n\nAnswer: Edmund Grey\n\nDavid told Edmund that he was devising a new drug which would restore an amnesiac's memory. Since Edmund was desperate for Maria to remember her life with him, he really wanted this medicine. Edmund threatened David over this drug so David provided him with it to avoid being physically harmed by Edmund.\n\n10. Palmer ended up getting married a whopping four times throughout the 1980s. However, just one of these unions constituted a remarriage. Which lady did he remarry?\n\nAnswer: Daisy Murdoch\n\nPalmer schemed his way into many a woman's heart and this was never truer in the 1980s. Initially, he married a much younger Donna Beck but their marriage was short lived since he realized he was still in love with his first wife, Daisy Murdoch. Daisy and Palmer remarried sometime in the early to mid 1980s but were not husband and wife for that long. Palmer had two additional short term marriages with Cynthia Preston and Natalie Marlowe.\n\nSource: Author CAGuy0206\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor Gamemaster1967 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
