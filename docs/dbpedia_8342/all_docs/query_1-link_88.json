        "text": "SE JM\n\nA. The Status of the parliamentary administration\n\nThe Chancellery of the Sejm performs organizational, technical and consultative tasks related to the activity of the Sejm and its organs. The Chancellery of the Sejm could be defined as an integrated and full-fledged Sejm service system for legal, organizational, logistical, advisory and financial matters.\n\nThe operation of the Chancellery is based on the following rules:\n\n-political impartiality of the Chancellery of the Sejm,\n\n-information self-reliance of the Sejm (it relies on its own body of experts),\n\n-full budgetary autonomy (a draft budget is passed by the Marshal of the Sejm [Speaker of the House] on the motion of the Chief of the Chancellery of the Sejm, the Finance Minister automatically incorporates this draft into the draft of the national budget),\n\n-maximizing legislative assistance (i.a. through strengthening of legal expertise support),\n\n-conformity to the market principles (viz. running a restaurant, a hotel and provision of other services to the Members).\n\nThe aim of the Chancellery is to enable the MPs to perform their representative functions and also provide them with professional assistance including, in particular, access to professional literature, expertise, other reports and materials related to the work of the Sejm.\n\nThe Chancellery of the Sejm provides technical, organizational and financial means for the proper functioning of MPs' offices or other organizational units rendering services to MPs in constituencies. The members of legal services of the Chancellery of the Sejm attend the proceedings relating to bills and draft resolutions and are entitled make conclusions and remarks within the field of law and legislation.\n\nThe organization of the Chancellery of the Sejm is specified in the Statute of the Chancellery, promulgated on request of the Chief of the Chancellery of the Sejm, by the Marshal of the Sejm. The organizational units of the Chancellery of the Sejm, according to its Statute, are: the Executive Office of the Marshal of the Sejm, the Information Bureau, the Legal and Organizational Bureau, the Interparliamentary Relations Bureau, the Sejm Sittings Secretariat, the Legislative Bureau, the Bureau of Research, the Sejm Committees' Bureau, the Deputies' Service Bureau, Sejm Library, Sejm Publishing Office, Computer Centre, Parliament Guard, and units of administrative and financial nature (see diagram attached).\n\nIn Poland there is a fundamental distinction among public officials. Under Article 153 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland a corps of civil servants operates in the organs of government (the Prime Minister is superior of such corps of civil servants). The status of civil servants is regulated by the Civil Service Act (1998).\n\nOther officials come under the provisions of Employees in State Offices Act (1982), or Employees in Courts and Public Prosecutors Office Act (1998), or Employees in Local Government Offices (1990). They are employed under private law contracts and subject to the jurisdiction of Labour Courts.\n\nThe Employees in State Offices Act regulates the status of the administrative staff in the Chancellery of the Sejm, the Chancellery of the Senate, the Chancellery of the President, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Tribunal, the Commissioner for the Citizens Rights and some non-governmental bodies. The Act regulates also status of government officials who are not members of the Civil Service Corps.\n\nRights and duties of the parliamentary staff are specified by The Employees in State Offices Act, Internal Law enacted by the Marshal of the Sejm and by the Chief of the Chancellery and by individual private law contracts.\n\nRecruitment of employees in the Chancellery of the Sejm is an open and competitive process. Anyone who complies with the requirements specified in notices about vacancies can apply. The vacancies are published in the newspapers and, on the web site of the Chancellery office.\n\nSome of the posts in the structure of the Chancellery (posts connected with the legislative process) are subjected to the special procedure of recruitment which requires a 12-month preparatory service, which is a form of introductory training. This procedure is specified by the internal regulation of the Chancellery.\n\nSuch preparation gives candidates both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Theoretical part of the preparatory service consists of (amongst others):\n\n·information on functioning of the Sejm and legal information (legislative procedure, constitutional sources of law, rules of practice, EU law, status of a public officer),\n\n·basic knowledge about organisational and functional principles of a given office (strategy and legal basis for the functioning of a given office, etc.)\n\nDuring the preparatory service the candidate learns about the structure and tasks of the office, its specific units and the structure of subordinate organisational units, especially those, which have direct contact with the public.\n\nThe preparatory service ends with an interview before the examination committee. If the result is positive, the candidate gets a permanent contract, otherwise the contract is terminated. If the new employee demonstrates theoretical knowledge and practical skills and knowledge of organisational and functional principles relating to the exercise of the office, the Chief of the Chancellery may shorten the period of the preparatory service up to 6 months or even waive the obligation to go with it.\n\nThe most common procedure of recruitment for higher posts is internal promotion. Sometimes these posts are filled by way of competition. The Chancellery of the Sejm has its own salary rules different from Civil Service Corps rules.\n\nB. The relation between the political bodies and the parliamentary administration\n\nThe Chancellery of the Sejm is directed by the Chief of the Chancellery with assistance of no more than two deputies (art. 200 of the Standing Orders). The Chief of the Chancellery is appointed and recalled by the Marshal of the Sejm in consultation with the Rules and Deputies Affairs Committee. The opinion of the Committee is not binding for the Marshal. Deputy Chiefs of the Chancellery are appointed and recalled by the Marshal of the Sejm in consultation with the Chief of the Chancellery.\n\nThe Chief and his deputies are not subject to the provisions of Employees in State Offices Act, neither they are members of the Civil Service Corps.\n\nThe Marshal has not direct influence over the configuration of the parliamentary administration.\n\nC. The responsibility of the Chief of the Chancellery\n\nUnder Article 201 of the Standing Orders, the Chief of the Chancellery of the Sejm is the official superior of all the employees of the Chancellery of the Sejm and is responsible for their activity. He is also responsible for implementation of the budget of the Chancellery of the Sejm and for the property of the State Treasury administered by the Chancellery of the Sejm. Deputies of the Chief have their own areas of activity, but responsibility to the Marshal on behalf of the whole of the administration is borne by the Chief. The consequence of the hierarchical structure of the Chancellery is low autonomy of the middle grade executive staff. However, particular units inter-operate autonomously to some extent.\n\nIn the Chancellery of the Sejm there is no Standing Committees staff other than strictly technical one (secretarial and documentation clerks). The staff of each Standing Committee belongs to the Sejm Sittings Secretariat (one of the units of the Chancellery). The staff of the committee is accountable to the Chief of the Chancellery but also to the Chair of the Committee.\n\nD.Data on the parliamentary workload\n\nPoland, like most modern democracies, has a bicameral parliament. The legislative power is vested in the Sejm and the Senate. The Sejm of the Republic of Poland is composed of 460 Deputies The two legislative bodies are elected each for 4-year terms of office.\n\nThe Sejm debates in the course of sittings (there are no sessions). Timetable of the Sittings of the Sejm is set by the Presidium of the Sejm or by way of a resolution of the Sejm. Each sitting lasts from one to four days (usually Wednesday  Friday or Tuesday - Friday).\n\nDuring the first two years of the current term (the period between 19.10.2001 and 30.09.2003) there were 57 sittings of the Sejm (19 sittings in 2003) which covered 157 sittings days.\n\nUnder article 193 of the Standing Orders:\n\nThe Sejm shall pass bills by a majority of votes in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of Deputies, unless the Constitution provides otherwise. The same procedure shall apply to adoption of resolutions and other decisions, unless provisions of the Constitution, of statutes or the Standing Orders of the Sejm provide otherwise.\n\n-1.01.2002-31.12.2002  218 bills,\n\n-1.01.2003- 30.09.2003  157 bills.\n\nDuring 19.10.2001-30.09.2003 the Sejm adopted almost 600 bills, resolutions, and other measures.\n\nSejm committees are Sejm organs established for the consideration and preparation of matters under deliberation by the Sejm, as well as expression of their opinions on matters referred for their consideration by the Sejm, the Marshal of the Sejm or the Presidium of the Sejm. Committees are also supervisory organs of Sejm, within the scope specified by the Constitution and statutes.\n\nAccording to the established practice, the nature of standing committees reflects their subject-matter, functions or organizational status (i.e. its duties corresponds with the scope of activity of one of the supreme or central organs of the State). The Standing Orders of the Sejm establishes 25 standing committees.\n\nThe scope of activities of individual committees is specified in an appendix to the Standing Orders of the Sejm. The most important duties of standing committees include:\n\n- consideration of bills and draft resolutions;\n\n- consideration of resolutions, adopted by the Senate, relating either to introduction of amendments to the text of a bill passed by the Sejm or rejection of it,\n\n- consideration of reports and information from ministers and heads of the supreme organs of the State administration, as well as heads of other State offices and institutions;\n\n- analyse of activities of individual branches of administration and State economy;\n\n- giving opinion on motions to elect or appoint individual persons to, or recall from, particular State offices, which have been referred to them by the Marshal of the Sejm.\n\nIn order to deal with the matters not covered by the competence of its standing committees, the Sejm may establish special committees. Upon the creation of a special committee, the Sejm defines, by means of a resolution, its aims, principles and procedures of operation. Such committees operate temporarily and are dissolved upon the presentation of a report to the Sejm on the activities performed.\n\nThe average number of sittings of each committee during the period between 19.10.2001 and 31.12.2002 was 62.\n\nMain rules of the procedure of standing committee sittings are specified by the Standing Orders. However, there are many customs and practises which are not contained in this act.\n\nAccording to the Standing Orders the duty of the Marshal of the Sejm is to ensure the operation and punctuality of the work of Sejm and its organs. He has the power to control the regularity of the procedures adopted by the committees.\n\nE.Relations between the parliamentary administration and the legislative process\n\nThere are four units of the Chancellery which offer all kind of services connected with the legislative process:\n\n-The Sejm Sittings Secretariat is responsible for organising and preparing the plenary sittings. It sets up the order of all items of business which the Sejm will be dealing with during the sittings. It also supports the Presidium of the Sejm (the Marshal and the Vice-Marshals) in managing the internal affairs of the Sejm;\n\n-The Sejm Committees' Bureau is responsible for organising and preparing committees sittings;\n\n-The Legislative Bureau is responsible for compliance of draft legislation (drafts and amendments) with the system of drafting rules;\n\n-The Bureau of Research - on request of Deputies and the Sejm organs - gives experts' opinions and information about:\n\n·interpretation, contents and implementation of legal acts - mainly in the field of constitutional, administrative , civil, economy, labour and criminal law;\n\n·economic policy, agriculture, food industry, environmental protection, international economic cooperation, regional and transborder cooperation;\n\n·political systems of particular countries, legal regulations and institutional solutions binding in those countries,\n\n·European integration, international relations, Poland's foreign and defence policies;\n\n·work of ministries and other state institutions as well as non-governmental organizations;\n\n·taxation issues, functioning of certain financial institutions or financial mechanisms that exist in other countries;\n\n·general and particular solutions regarding education, health care, social security, housing policy, existing in foreign countries.\n\nThe Parliamentary Law Unit of the Bureau of Research is responsible for preparing - on request of Deputies and the Sejm organs - expert reports on consistency of bills with the Constitution.\n\nThe European Law Unit of the Bureau of Research supplies the organs of the Sejm with opinions on conformity of non-government bills with EU law.\n\n(The Standing Order requires a written statement to be attached to every bill as to its conformity with EU legislation. If the legislation is being proposed by the government, its conformity with EU law is verified by the Department of European Law in the Office of the Committee for European Integration. If it is not a government bill, the statement on conformity with EU law is verified by the European Law Unit of the Bureau of Research of the Sejm Chancellery. If the statement concludes that a bill does not conform to EU law, it does not preclude the bill from being passed but it does provide information on areas of non-conformity. Parliament must then consider such areas of non-conformity, and amendments may be proposed to overcome points of non-compliance.\n\nF.Latest changes in parliamentary administration\n\nThe most important changes in Polish parliamentary administration are connected with the ongoing process of European Integration. In 200, on the basis of covenant between the Chancellery of the Sejm, the Chancellery of the Senate, the Office of the European Integration Committee, the Governmental Legislative Centre and The French Parliament (Sénat and Assemblée Nationale), as well as the Spanish Senate, there was adopted a PHARE Programme: Institutional Strengthening  Administration. Parliamentary Legislative Procedures\n\nThe main purpose of the program was to enhance the harmonisation of the Polish legislation with the EU law. The objective of the program was to strengthen the governmental and parliamentary legislative process of transposition of the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe program contains the following components:\n\n(1) preparing a report which provides a complete picture of the situation and formulates recommendations in view of the following aims:\n\n·Improving the co-ordination between the Government and the Sejm and the Senate departments responsible for examining and appraising the conformity of the proposed domestic legislation to the EC legislation\n\n·Improving the efficiency of the procedure for preparing bills at Governmental level, Improving the efficiency of the legislative procedures for examination by the Sejm and the Senate of bills transposing the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe report was prepared after:\n\n-the assessment of the legislative procedures and methodologies at the parliamentary level,\n\n-the appraisal of the legislative and methodological procedures at Government level in the field of harmonisation of law (in particular the functions of the legal advice, as provided in France by the Conseil dEtat, the SGG) and assessment of inter-ministerial co-operation,\n\n-the assessment of the information circuits and access to relevant documentation.\n\n(2) Training of the administrative staff (approx. 230 persons):\n\n- training of drafters (Presentation of the techniques of transposition the Union law into the domestic legal system used in selected Member States and different methods of harmonising national laws within the European Union),\n\n- training of Parliamentary Committee staff (the aim was to improve the quality of work and organisation of the Parliamentary Committees and developing the level of skills of the staff as regards the assimilation of the acquis to enable them to channel Members of Parliaments requests correctly).\n\n- training of experts (the purpose of the training was to provide the concerned experts with a comprehensive knowledge of comparative law and of the existing procedures in different parliaments and governments of the Member States in order to enable them to identify, in minimum time, the difficulties that the transposition of the EU law to domestic law might entail).\n\n- study visits for staff in a Member States Parliament or governmental institutions (in France, Spain and Germany)\n\n(3) Training and study visit of parliamentarians\n\n(4) Setting up and development of the function of the Parliamentary Centre for European Documentation and Information (the Centre) The Centre was established at the Sejm.
