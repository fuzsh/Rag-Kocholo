        "text": "To date 4,221 libraries in 1,385 communes (70% of the target group) received support under five rounds of the program. More than 12,000 librarians have joined LDP activities.\n\nUntil 2015 the program was carried within the partnership of the Polish-American Freedom Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was part of a broader initiative of the Gates Foundation, “Global Libraries,” covering about a dozen countries. In Poland, the Information Society Development Foundation, established by PAFF in 2008, performed the role of manager from the outset of the Library Development Program. The Gates Foundation entrusted PAFF with a $31 million grant for the program.\n\n3,808 public libraries from 1,256 communes with populations up to 20,000 (nearly 60% of the target group) were involved in the program, recruited in three rounds between 2008 and 2015. 10,000 librarians received specialist support in the form of counseling and training, while libraries were equipped with nearly 8,000 pieces of hardware: computers, tablets, printers, multimedia projectors, and other devices. Additionally, libraries received software worth $18 million provided free of charge by Microsoft. 450 libraries received small grants for expanding their offer aimed at local resident activation. Funds for organizing 1,000 study tours found their way to librarians, who also participated in such experience exchange fora as the annual Library Congress.\n\nThe Library Development Program contributed to the emergence of many initiatives for strengthening the entire library system. LDP communication and advocacy efforts led to, among others, the establishment of the National Partnership for Library Development (consisting of more than 100 representatives of different backgrounds), 16 regional partnerships with provincial authorities aiming to promote public library modernization in areas with smaller populations, and local partnerships for library development in more than 300 communes.\n\nIn 2008 PAFF signed a cooperation agreement with the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, which initiated the multiannual “Library+” program carried out by the Polish Book Institute. The objectives of both initiatives were similar – the Foundation and the Ministry were shaping their activities in such a way that these could reinforce and complement each other. Another memorandum was signed with the Ministry of Administration and Digitalization and Orange, based on which all public libraries in the country were provided with free Internet access from 2009 to 2015. There were also joint actions carried out with the National Library, provincial public libraries, the Association of Polish Librarians, and numerous non-governmental organizations.\n\nIn 2012 the Information Society Development Foundation received the E-Inclusion Award for the Library Development Program from the European Commission in a competition that promotes best practices in using modern information and communication technologies and preventing digital exclusion.\n\nSince 2016 libraries in rural areas and small towns have been further supported by PAFF own funds through numerous training and e-learning courses for library employees and their local partners, grants for technological expansion of selected libraries, support in their networking and cooperation efforts aimed at benefiting the local community, as well as creation and development of innovation incubators based on library infrastructure. The LABiB initiative is being developed as well, which is a network of librarian-innovators using the LABIB.pl social portal to popularize best practices in activities held at libraries.\n\nThe years 2021 and 2022 saw the launch of the fourth program round financed from PAFF funds. Apart from continuing to work with the entire library network, this edition channeled support to 247 new facilities based in 79 communes. Participating facilities received 20 months of training and advisory, equipment, and ample opportunities for exchanging experiences.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the currently ongoing fifth round, another 166 facilities from rural communes, rural and municipal communes, and localities with up to 50,000 inhabitants joined the program. The program provides them in assistance in, among other things, preparing an offer of services aiding the integration of Ukrainian refugees with local communities, delivering non-formal education on climate change and natural environment protection to residents under the “Library for Climate” component, as well as providing digital education combined with assistance in improving digital literacy.\n\nThe program promotes a wide array of socially activating efforts, public consultations and actions aimed at involving the residents concerned in relevant issues. Libraries are flexible in their response to changing needs and emerging challenges. From day one of Russia’s 2022 aggression against Ukraine, libraries have been supporting refugees and reshaping their offer to help refugees become part of the local community.\n\nThe Foundation has disbursed $7,126,349, including $511,836 for the current edition."
