        "text": "An impressive 109 new libraries joined the ranks of those co-cataloguing with the National Library of Poland this year. This was possible thanks to their integration into the national library network with system Alma and search engine Primo, as part of the multiyear programme “National Reading Development Programme 2.0 for 2021-2025”. The integration of 109 new libraries into the system this year was possible thanks to fact that the system has already been implemented and is running successfully at the National Library of Poland, the Jagiellonian Library (the second-largest library in Poland and the country’s largest academic library), two regional libraries – the Voivodeship Public Library in Kielce and the Voivodeship Public Library in Lublin – and the libraries of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń and the Catholic University of Lublin.\n\nMore"
