This resource is only available on campus and cannot be accessed from off campus.\n\nRequires downloading client program and install the software (setup.exe.) from eastview.com. Please note that this client program is necessary to access the database, since there is no direct access URL that can be referenced. Other web browsers (e.g. Firefox ore Chorme) will not work, as Siku Quanshu contains archaic Chinese characters not included in the current Unicode standard. Once the client program is installed, users can open the program on their PC (only work with Windows, not MAC), select IP Login, and gain access from a computer with a PSU IP address.\n\nInstructions to install and use the GlobalProtect VPN.\n\nRegister for Day Pass using your PSU email address and you will receive a confirmation email from WRDS with a link for limited-time access (typically 24 hours). After the link expires, you can request a new WRDS Day Pass."
