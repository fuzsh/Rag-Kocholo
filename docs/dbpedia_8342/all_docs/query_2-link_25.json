        "text": "Cooperation with policy-makers will continue into the future as regulations implementing the new copyright law are put into place for the final phase of the legislative process, and as new issues emerge.\n\nRead the background, the main achievements and follow the timeline of the reform process.\n\n“The EIFL project grant in 2012 kickstarted library engagement in legislative reform. It got librarians in Poland thinking about copyright for the first time. It enabled production of the first position paper on library copyright issues that was submitted in the Ministry of Culture’s public consultation. Since then we have built on the work, and our position has evolved. But without doubt, support from EIFL got the process going.” - Barbara Szczepanska, Project Manager, Library and Information Services Manager at Hogan Lovells (Warsaw).\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2004, the Law on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights was amended when Poland joined the European Union. While there was a rather good list of limitations and exceptions, they were badly in need of updating for the digital world.\n\nIn February 2012, following the declaration that Poland would not join the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a plurilateral treaty being negotiated between industrialized nations, Donald Tusk (then Prime Minister of Poland, now President of the European Council) promised to continue the debate on digital freedoms.\n\nConsequently in March 2012, the Ministry of Administration & Digital Affairs announced the formation of five task forces to work on legislative reforms essential for the growth of a robust digital society in Poland, such as rights for Internet users, safeguards for privacy, and copyright law reform.\n\nThe consultation process on copyright law reform was launched by the Ministry of Culture in the spring of 2013 with the Copyright Forum, a multi-stakeholder group to lead discussions on the future shape of Poland’s copyright law.\n\nIt was essential that librarians took part, for one key reason: to ensure that libraries in Poland can fulfill their social and public responsibilities in the twenty-first century.\n\nObjectives for copyright law reform\n\nIn June 2012, the Centrum Cyfrowe Projekt Polska and EIFL partner consortium, the Poznan Foundation of Scientific Libraries, joined forces with four main objectives:\n\nto raise awareness of the importance of copyright limitations and exceptions and the role of libraries in contributing to a creative knowledge society and economy;\n\nto advocate for well-crafted limitations and exceptions that serve society to policy makers, national copyright experts, members of parliament, journalists, the wider library community, as well as to the general public;\n\nto ensure that librarians participated in the debate on copyright law reform in Poland, and\n\nto produce a draft law accommodating library problems and needs.\n\nProject timeline\n\nJune 2012 – December 2016\n\nChanges to Polish copyright law: main achievements\n\nFor the first time, libraries may undertake digital preservation, including for unpublished works. This means that Polish cultural and literary heritage, especially for unique or rare works, is legally safeguarded for the future (Art. 28.1.2).\n\nLibraries may digitize works in their collections and make them available to users on library terminals, in accordance with the European Court of Justice ruling in the TU Darmstadt case (2015/04/germany-technische-universitat-darmstadt-wins-landmark-case-with-hogan-lovells-digital-use-of-copyright-protected-works-in-public-libraries/). Art. 28. 3 permits libraries to digitize their physical collections, irrespective of whether the publisher offers a digital version of the work or not. In return, the number of copies made available at electronic reading points must not exceed the number of physical copies held by the library.\n\nLibraries may digitize material, with certain conditions, for use in virtual learning environments (VLEs). This provision (Art. 27. 2) will assist the development of e-learning and distance education.\n\nThe new law makes major changes regarding the use of works where the library cannot currently request permission either because the rightsholder can’t be found (known as orphan works), or where the work is no longer commercially available.\n\nIn accordance with the (ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm) European orphan works directive (2012), libraries in Poland are now permitted to digitize orphan works and to make them available online (Arts. 355 – 359). Since the directive has cross-border effect, libraries in other EU member states may also use Polish orphan works, and libraries in Poland can use works deemed orphaned in other EU countries.\n\nThe new law implements the (ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/20110920-mou_en.pdf) EU Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Key Principles on the Digitization and Making Available of Out-of-Commerce Works (Arts. 3510 - 3512). Poland is the third country after France and Germany to implement the MoU.\n\nThe European Directive on Public Lending Right (PLR), that grants the author or owner the right to authorize or prohibit the public lending of a work, is introduced into Polish law for the first time. In line with the majority of European countries, PLR is applied to works in public libraries only (Arts. 28. 1 and 351 - 354). Payment to authors for the lending of their books is based on actual library loans. Payments for PLR are paid by central government in a specially ring-fenced budget funded by taxes on gambling (such as the national lottery, and betting on sports).\n\nThe right to quote from whole works that are short, such as a poem, is now set out in the law. In addition, the purpose of the quotation includes scientific analysis, criticism, education, parody, pastiche, and caricature (Art. 29).\n\nTo facilitate creativity on new media, such as amateur videos or a library promotional video posted on social networks, a new article (Art. 292) permits the use of a copyrighted work that is ‘incidental’, such as a painting appearing in the background of a video or photo.\n\nThe paying public domain (or domaine public payant), a remuneration right for the use of works no longer protected by copyright, is removed from Polish law.\n\n“The project was a unique opportunity for me to study the practical operation of copyrigt in today’s libraries. I discovered that many of the problems faced by libraries touch upon a fundamental part of copyright theory i.e. the balance between authors’ and public interests. But the most rewarding part of the project was that I could help design solutions to the problems, in an attempt to bring the theoretical debate to a more practical level.” - Dr. Krzysztof Siewicz, Project Legal Advisor\n\nTIMELINE FOR THE REFORM PROCESS\n\n2012\n\nBringing the perspective of public interest institutions, their goals and social mission to the discussions. Libraries participated in five stakeholder meetings organized by the Ministry of Culture & National Heritage (responsible for copyright law) and the Ministry of Administration & Digital Affairs on copyright law reform initiated by the Prime Minister’s office. The library intervention is recorded in the official protocol of the meetings.\n\nDeveloping a common library position for the first time. Three consultation meetings were held with the library community including the National Library and Łazarski University Library in Warsaw, Jagiellonian University Library and Economic University Library in Krakow, University Library Toruń, Banking School Library and University Library in Poznań, Economic University Library and Public Library in Wrocław and the Information Society Development Foundation.\n\nRaising public awareness. An article on library copyright issues was published in the high profile legal section of “Rzeczpospolita”, one of the largest circulation national newspapers in Poland, written by Project Manager, Barbara Szczepanska.\n\n2013\n\nAnalysing library copyright provisions. A crucial output of the project was a legal analysis of provisions concerning libraries in Polish law (Act on Libraries and Act on Copyright), and the drafting of amendments to the copyright law to reflect the new reality for libraries and their users. The draft law was well received by the library community at large and endorsed by professional bodies including the Conference of Polish Academic Library Directors, the Conference of Public Library Directors, EBIB Association and the Polish Librarians Association.\n\nPromoting the library model law. Working with a professional media organization, videos were made to explain the library model law in a user-friendly way. (bibliosfera.net/BazaWiedzy/Barbara%20Szczepa%C5%84ska) View three videos online.\n\nIncreasing library visibility among legal experts. The library model law was published in the renowned legal journal Zeszyty Naukowe Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego. Prace z Prawa Własności Intelektualnej, stimulating discussion of library issues among legal academics.\n\n27 April 2013.
