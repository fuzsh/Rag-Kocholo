For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections hus been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to be available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factboc 'K. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. it is coordinated, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Basic trends (C) Poland is the largest of the East European Communist countries.' At the end of 1979 it had a population of 33.3 million people and a land area of 120,600 square miles slightly smaller in area than Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky combined, but with a population density approximately equal to that of Pennsylvania and Ohio. The economy has grown rapidly throughout the post -World War II period, and it is now in an intermediate stage of development much less advanced than the economies of France and West Germany but far ahead of those of Mexico and Brazil. The Polish economy is unique among the economies of Communist Eastern Europe in its retention of a private agricultural sector. Poland's gross national product (GNP) amounted to US$54.6 billion in 1972 (1971 prices). In terms of GNP per capita, Poland ranks behind all industrialized West European countries, and it is only moderately well -off by Communist standards. Poland's per capita GNP of US$1,650 in 1972 was not significantly different from those of Bulgaria ($1,620), Hungary ($1,700), and Romania ($1,470), but well below those of Czechoslovakia ($2,540) and ELsi Germany ($2,650). The most nearly comparable West European per capita GNP was in Ireland, with a per capita GNP in 1972 of about $1,740. Per capita GNP in the rest of Western Europe, except for Spain, Portugal, and Greece, was much greater. The difference in standards of living in Poland and in Western Europe is even greater than the difference between levels of per capita CNP. In its efforts 'to achieve rapid industrial development, Poland's Communist government has devoted a larger share of the national product to investment than is generally the case in Western countries, leaving a corre- spondingly smaller Share for consumption. In 1971, about 30% of Poland's GNP went into investment and another 20% went into government services, 'Throughout this chapter, references to Communist Eastern Europe refer to the group of count.-:es encompassing Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and Romania. administration, and defense. Personal consumption, which accounts for more than 60% of GNP in most Western countries, accounted for only.50% in Poland. Even though the government has directed a larger proportion of the country's resources to investment throughout the postwar period, there has also been some growth in consumption. In spite of its dependence on imports fc, a number of important industrial materials, Poland's raw material base, on balance, has been a positive factor in its postwar industrial growth. The country is poor or entirely lacking in iron ore, petroleum, manganese ore, potash, phosphate rock, and cotton, and must import the bulk of its supplies of those materials (Figure 1). Poland also imports large quantities of grain, which it uses to a large extent to expand its livestock production; livestock products are a major source of foreign exchange. The pattern of postwar industrial development, which emphasized iron and steel, aluminum, and more recently, petroleum processing and petrochemicals, has intensified the country's dependence on imported raw materials and increased its vulnerability to a cutoff of supplies. Poland's own extensive resources of coal, zinc, sulfur, and timber, well as its large, diverse agricultural output, are important sources of export earnings, which enable the country to pay for the imported. raw materials and t:l \"chinery it has required for rapid industrialization. Coal, timber, and agricultural and food products are the source of about three fifths of the hard currency export earnings. In spite of the rapid growth of machinery exports to other Communist countries, fuels and materials still make up about one -third of Poland's total exports to those countries. Polish technology is inferior by West European and U.S. standards, and the quality of industrial output is low. Neglect in the postwar periot has, to a large extent, left Poland's prewar industries with outdated equipment. The new industries, including iron and steel, machine building, and chemicals, have been developed largely in isolation from the froe world markets and have been little influenced by Western technology and marketing methods. Instead, 1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 FIGURE I.

As a result, much of the country's industry, although it covers a large part of domestic consumption and provides exports to other Communist countries and to less- developed Western countries, cannot meet the standards of the advanced market economies. This is particularly true of the Polish machine building industry. Its continued growth since the late 1950's has depended particularly on Soviet willingness to buy increasing quantities of Polish machinery. In Poland's industrial sector, only the food processing industry sells any sizable part of its output to the industrial West. Communist Party leader Gierek, who succeeded Wladyslaw Gornulka after the workers' riots in December 1970, is continuing with Gomulka's plan to increase Polish imports of advanced technology from the industrial West. The plan for 1971 -75 calk for purchases of Western capital equipment to double over the previous 5 years. Since the bulk of such purchases is financed by credits, Polish hard currency indebtedness will increase considerably. A doubling of imports of Western capital equipment in 1972 alone resulted in an increase of Poland's estimated medium- and long -term indebtedness to the industrial West from $1.2 billion at the end of 1971 to $1.5 billion at the end of 1972. B. Structure of the economy Poland has maintained satisfactory rates of economic growth throughout the postwar period, except during the early 1950's. GNP increased at an average yearly rate of 5% between 1950 -70, and 6% in 1971 -72 (Figure 2). Moreover, Poland avoided the sharp declines in the rate of growth that East Germany and Czechoslovakia suffered in the early 1960's, and has maintained a growth rate higher than that of Hungary, dough lower than that of either Bulgaria or Romania. The rate of growth -if industrial production, especially producer goods, has been high, averaging 7% a year during 1961 -70 and 8% during 1971 -72. (U /OU) Net agricultural output �less feed, seed, and waste� increased at a rate of only 1.8% a year during 1961 -72, a rate considerably slower than those of Bulgaria and Romania. Value added in agriculture, however, has increased more rapidly in Poland than in any other East European Communist country, reflecting the slower growth of industrial inputs in Poland. The growth of value added in Polish agriculture is estimated to have averaged 3.';% a year during 1961 -70 and 5.7 a year during 1971 -72. (U /OU) In 1972 about 47% of the GNP originated in industry and 21% in agriculture. The pattern of employment in the economy is quite different from that of output; in 1972, 36% of the 16.8 million working population were employed in agriculture, while 29% worked in industry and 35% in other nonagricultural occupations. The importance of industry to the Polish economy is largely the result of policies of the country's Communist government. As late as 1950, the relative shares of industry and agriculture were about the reverse of those in 1972: agriculture contributed 41% and industry 24% of GNP.

Mining and mefallurgy, including large hard coal and iron and steel industries, brown coal mining, and zinc, copper, sulfur, and aluminum ore mining and processing, make up a sizable segment of Polish industry, accounting for about 19% of gross industrial output and 15% of industrial employment in 1971. Machine building and food processing are Poland's two largest industries, contributing 27% and 18 respectively, of industrial output in 1971. The manufacture of chemicals, one of the most rapidly expanding industries in the economy, accounted for about 9% of industrial output in that year. (U /OU) In its postwar program for economic growth, the Communist government concentrated a large share of its resources on the development of industries that had little economic significance in prewar Poland -iron and steel, machine building, and chemicals -and on the development of newly discovered or unexploited resources -brown coal, copper, and sulfur. As a result of these policies, the new industries have developed rapidly. According to official figures, the 1971 output in machine building, which accounted for only 7% of gross industrial output in 1950, was 28 times the 1950 level, whereas the output of chemicals, which had accounted for less than 2% of the total output, was 18 times the 1950 level. Although the large prewar industries -hard coal, textiles, and food processing were relatively neglected during the postwar period and have grown more slowly, they are still as important as the newer sectors and are now receiving increasing attention. The shares of gross output, employment, and fixed capital in various branches of industry are shown in Figure 3, and the growth of gross output by branch is shown in Figure 4. (U /OU) Poland, like the other Communist countries, experienced difficulties in the mid- 1950's as a result of forced growth in heavy industry. It was obliged temporarily to hold down the growth of investment and relax its efforts in heavy industry in order to permit consumption to reach an acceptable level and to allow fuel, power, and raw material production to catch up with industrial requirements. Since 1958, the Polish Government again has maintained a high rate of investment to achieve high rates of industrial growth. This goal has been tempered, however, by concern that ,consumption should increase at a slow but steady rate and that a balance should be maintained between the production of fuels and other raw ma:arials and the growth of the industrial sectors that consume them. The pattern of Poland's industrial development since 1958 has been geared to export possibilities, to a much greater extent than in the early FIGURE 3.

Large investments in coal, chemicals, copper, and food processing are aimed largely at increasing long -run export capacity. (U /OU) 1. Agriculture, fisheries, and forestry (U /OU) a. Agriculture Poland is the largest agricultural producer in Eastern Europe (excluding European U.S.S.R.). About 62% of the land area is devoted to agriculture including 48% under cultivation and almost 14% in meadows and pastures (Figure 5). The amount of arable land per capita �about 0.46 hectare, in 1971 ranks among the top 10 countries in Europe. Poland's climate and soil permit cultivation of a wide variety of crops. Fairly mild winters with moderate rainfall are 4 favorable to the cultivation of winter grains. The frost free season is long enough for the successf ul cultivation of most summer grains, sugar beets, and potatoes. The predominantly sandy soils, however, require good management to make them highly productive. The agricultural sector has adequate investment funds, but industrial inputs are not available in sufficient quantity and quality. The socialized agricultural sector is much better supplied than the private sector with most types of agricultural machinery, fertilizer, breeding stock, and new varieties of seed. Storage and shipping facilities are inadequate as a result of persistent sho�tages of building materials and transportation equipment, especially refrigerated trucks, so that serious losses occur from spoilage. Moreover the regime has had scant success in recent years in attracting trained young men to the farms and keeping them there, so that a manpower shortage occurs during the harvest -eason even though about 36% of the Polish labor force (6 million persons) work in agriculture. The preference of trained agronomists and graduates of agricultural colleges for ad- ministrative positions in the cities rather than for jobs as advisors on farms further complicates the introduction of new agricultural technology. The principal crops grown are wheat, rye, barley, oats, sugar beets, and potatoes. Of the total area sown in 1971, 57% was in grains, 18% in potatoes, 6% in industrial crops (sugar beets, oilseeds, tobacco, and flax), 14% in fodder crops, and 5% in other crops. Rye, of which Poland is the world's second largest producer, is the country's most important grain crop, occupying 45% of the total grain acreage. The total area annually planted to ;sops in Poland has been gradually declining since 1960. In addition, there has been a shift in acreage from grain �which covered about 60% of sown land in 1955 �to fodder and industrial crops. Declining prices in the world sugar market led Poland, a surplus producer, to cut back sugar beet acreage some 14% between 1965 and 1970. Nevertheless, the output of sugar beets continued to increase because of the larger input of fertilizer; only in 1969 �a bad weather year �did, output fall below the 1961 -65 annual average. The rising price of sugar in the international market may induce Polish officials further to stimulate domestic output by boosting producer prices for sugar beets.

Agriculture Poland is the largest agricultural producer in Eastern Europe (excluding European U.S.S.R.). About 62% of the land area is devoted to agriculture including 48% under cultivation and almost 14% in meadows and pastures (Figure 5). The amount of arable land per capita �about 0.46 hectare, in 1971 ranks among the top 10 countries in Europe. Poland's climate and soil permit cultivation of a wide variety of crops. Fairly mild winters with moderate rainfall are 4 favorable to the cultivation of winter grains. The frost free season is long enough for the successf ul cultivation of most summer grains, sugar beets, and potatoes. The predominantly sandy soils, however, require good management to make them highly productive. The agricultural sector has adequate investment funds, but industrial inputs are not available in sufficient quantity and quality. The socialized agricultural sector is much better supplied than the private sector with most types of agricultural machinery, fertilizer, breeding stock, and new varieties of seed. Storage and shipping facilities are inadequate as a result of persistent sho�tages of building materials and transportation equipment, especially refrigerated trucks, so that serious losses occur from spoilage. Moreover the regime has had scant success in recent years in attracting trained young men to the farms and keeping them there, so that a manpower shortage occurs during the harvest -eason even though about 36% of the Polish labor force (6 million persons) work in agriculture. The preference of trained agronomists and graduates of agricultural colleges for ad- ministrative positions in the cities rather than for jobs as advisors on farms further complicates the introduction of new agricultural technology. The principal crops grown are wheat, rye, barley, oats, sugar beets, and potatoes. Of the total area sown in 1971, 57% was in grains, 18% in potatoes, 6% in industrial crops (sugar beets, oilseeds, tobacco, and flax), 14% in fodder crops, and 5% in other crops. Rye, of which Poland is the world's second largest producer, is the country's most important grain crop, occupying 45% of the total grain acreage. The total area annually planted to ;sops in Poland has been gradually declining since 1960. In addition, there has been a shift in acreage from grain �which covered about 60% of sown land in 1955 �to fodder and industrial crops. Declining prices in the world sugar market led Poland, a surplus producer, to cut back sugar beet acreage some 14% between 1965 and 1970. Nevertheless, the output of sugar beets continued to increase because of the larger input of fertilizer; only in 1969 �a bad weather year �did, output fall below the 1961 -65 annual average. The rising price of sugar in the international market may induce Polish officials further to stimulate domestic output by boosting producer prices for sugar beets. Poland has made relatively good progress since the mid- 1950's in raising yields per hectare of major grain crops and since the mid- 1960's, for root crops.

The neglect of agriculture and attempts at collectivization in the early 1950's resulted in slow recovery to prewar levels of productivity. The acquiescence of the Gomulka regi ne in permitting a private agricultural sector to operate stimulated a rapid increase in yields per hectare in the late 1950's and in the 1960's. The average annual yields of Poland's important grain crops were 25% to 45% larger in 1966 -70 than in 1956- 60 (Figure 6). Because of inferior agricultural technology, however, yields are generally still lower in Poland than in West European countries with similar soil and climatic conditions. Livestock production has been expanding in recent years and accounted for nearly 47% of the gross value of agricultural output in Poland in 1972. The numbers of hogs and cattle have risen over the past decade, reaching postwar peak levels of 17.3 million and 11.5 million, respectively, in 1972 (June 30 census). Sheep raising is far less important, and after small increases in the mid- 1960's, the number of sheep has been declining since 1968 (Figure 7). The number of horses also has declined in Poland, but to a lesser degree than in other East European countries. The small private farms that are still characteristic of Polish agriculture continue to use horses both for draft power and for local transportation. The overall increase in livestock production during the 1960's enabled Poland to increase the domestic consumption of meat and other animal products and to remain an important exporter. Red meat production FIGURE 7.

Meat exports, most of which go to Western countries, increased rather rapidly in the first half of the decade (to about 220,000 tons in 1965), but dropped to 172,000 tons by 1971. Efforts to better satisfy domestic demand for meat required not only a cut back in exports but also large imports of pork in 1970 -71 by the Gierek regime, with the result that in 1971 Poland was a net importer of meat. Incentives offered to livestock producers and improved feed supplies boosted pork production in 1972 above the planned level and sharply lowered import require- ments. Poland's most important meat exports are bacon and canned ham. Most of the bacon is sent to the United Kingdom, and most of the canned ham is sold in the United States. Exports of fresh beef ta Western Europe are also large. In addition to meat, Poland exports sizable quantities of butter and eggs, although exports of both have dropped since the mid- 1960's as West European production caught up with demand. The increase in livestock production has required Poland to import large quantities of feedgrains (including whea.) and oileake. G ain imports, which amounted to about 1 million tons a year until 1956, rose rapidly after that year and averaged 2.7 million tons a year during 1961 -65. GraRn imports were subsequently cut back in support of the plan of becoming self sufficient in grain; they totaled about 2.2 million tons per vear dorir:g 1966 -70. The plan was doomed to failure, however, as livestock production stagnated and Poland had to import 2.5 million tons of grain in 1970. Gierek's planners eliminated self sufficiency in grain production as a goal in the 1971- 75 plan, and 2.9 million tons were imported in 1971. During 1956 -66, over two- thirds of t!ie grain imports came from the West; close to one -third of the total came from the United States alone. Since 1966, the U.S.S.R. has supplied an increasing share of the grain imports, while the U.S. share has dwindled, due mainly to the cutoff of P.L. 480 credits in 1964. During 1957 -64, the United States supplied $538 million in credits on favorable terms, enabling Poland to import grains to build up its livestock production and boost exports of meat and dairy products. The profitability of meat exports has declined in recent years not only because low -cost P.L. 480 credits dried up, but also because an expanding domestic market for animal products has reduced the share of output available for export to Western Europe. In view of recent Soviet grain production difficulties, Poland, in 6 1972, purchased a larger share of its grain from the United States and other Western countries. This can be expected to continue in the short run. Polish agriculture is characterized by small, privately owned farms, rather than by the large collectives typical of other Communist countries. About 83% of Poland's agricultural land is in private hands, 15% in state farms, and less than 2% in cooperative (collective) farms. The private sector embraces over 3 million farms with an average area of 5.4 hectares of land each (Figure 8). Between 1949 and 1956 Poland tried to get peasants to join collectives, subjecting private farms to heavy taxation and discrimination in the allocation of industrial materials and equipment, but the collectivization effort was not pushed as hard as in other Communist countries, and by 1956 collective farms included less than 10% of all the agricultural land. In June of that year, collectivization as a goal was dropped, and existing collectives were allowed to disband. Although the number of collectives has fluctuated since then, the dissolution of collectives has generally kept pace with the formation of new ones. The collectives, which now comprise less Than 2% of the agricultural land, generally include holdings that were too small and too poor to be farmed as individual unite Agricultural circles economic organizations of private farmers organized mostly for mechanization purposes, and akin to some West European cooperatives -have been encouraged among farmers. Private ownership of land remains inviolate, however, and there has been no pressure to convert these organizations into collectives. Figures 9 and 10 show the threshing of grain on a private farm and a private farm market in Poland. Socialized agriculture in Poland is represented chiefly by the state farms, which are operated much like state enterprises in other sectors. State farms hold 15.1 of the agricultural land. They were formed for the most part after World War II on abandoned FIGURE 8.

They have since gained some new acreage from reclaimed land and through annexation of private farms whose owners died without or deeded their farms to the state in return for pensions. Most state investment in agriculture in the past has been channeled into state farms for the purpose of developing new farming methods and improving plants, seeds, and livestock breeds. The small size of the typical private sector farm and the noncontiguous nature of the plots (in some instances plots were separated by several miles) prompted the regime to initiate a series of land reforms on 1 January 1968. The reforms sought to increase the size of the average private farm and to consolidate landholdings by obligating the state to purchase small, marginally productive or scattered landholdings for subsequent resale in the form of contiguous plots; to guarantee a pension to older farmers who turn over land to the state; and to sell land from the state land fund to private farmers, as well as to state farms to enlarge their holdings. So far, the program has met with only limited success. Between 1968 and 1970 about 500,000 hectares were relinquished by the state land fund, of which only 43% was sold to private farmers. While the total number of private farms deelinei slightly, the number having less than two hectares each increased. Since the mid- 1950's, Poland has tried to increase efficiency and promote technical change in agriculture by greatly increasing the allocation of resources to the sector. In an effort to end agricultural stagnation, the Gomulka government nearly doubled average annual investments in the sector during 1956- 60, compared to those of 1950 -55. Total outlays in agriculture rose 48% during 1961 -65 and 68% during 1966 -70 over the levels of the preceding 5-year periods. Agricultural investments as a percentage of total investments have risen steadily since 1956, as shown in the following tabulation: 1950 -55 10.1 1956 -60 12.5 1961 -65 13.9 1966 -70 16.1 1971 -75 (plan) 14.0 1971 15.6 1972 14.7 During 1966 -70, agriculture accounted for a greater percentage of investments than at any other time during the postwar period, although the 16.1% share was less than the 16.5% share planned for that period. The shortfall was due mainly to the fact that private investments, which made up roughly one -third of all agricultural investments in that period, did not meet expectations because of the limited availability of building materials and agricultural machinery. The 1971 -75 plan envisions that about 55% of the total investments in agriculture will be generated by private farms. In 1971, the private sector's share of agricultural investments was 38 the highest level in a decade. Deliveries of industrial goods fertilisers, building materials, and machinery�to agriculture also showed a large improvement but still fell siort of demand. Although the Polish Government has continued to espouse the long -range goal of socializing agriculture, the retention of private ownership has enabled it to avoid the costly and less productive investments that other Communist countries have had to make in new collective facilities to replace privately -owned buildings. Moreover, the willingness of peasants to work harder on their own farms than on collectives has generally resulted in more efficient use of machinery APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 FIGURE 10. Private farm market In Poland (U /(;U) FIGURE 9.

On the other hand, private ownership presents the Polish Government with unique problems of control. The government sets goals for production and marketing of farm commodities as well as for raising the level of technology by increasing the use of machinery, fertilizers, and improved types of seed. It can achieve these goals only by indirect methods such as price incentives, allocation of industrial inputs, and peasant education. The government had relied to some extent on compulsory deliveries of agricultural products to guide farm output, but abolished them as of 1 January 1972. This was an important step toward improving efficiency of farm production, because it eliminated state interference in the farmers' sphere of decision making as regards specialization. The bulk of state procurement of agricultural commodities is now made through \"voluntary\" sales by private farmers. These sales are made in part under contract, in which the farmer agrees in advance of harvest or livestock slaughter to sell certain quantities of produce or livestock products to the state at a specified price. The farmer may also sell commodities to the state in quantities over and above those contracted. In an effort to encourage the signing of contracts, the state has generally offered a slightly higher price for contract than for above contract sales. Farmers who sign contracts with the government are also generally given priority in obtaining supplies of fertilizer, feed, seed, and building materials in state or cooperative stores. Since taking power in late 1970, the Gierek regime. has also stimulated output in the private sector by raising prices of slaughter livestock on three separate occasions, abolishing state control over sales of coal to farmers, settling land property rights, reforming the tax system, initiating a rural health service, and establishing new local administrative units. The success of these policy changes is most evident in the sharp increase in procurement of livestock in 1972, as well as in gains in total livestock output compared to 1970 and 1971. With retail food prices frozen, however, the subsidy cost to the government for livestock products is rising rapidly, as are farmers' incomes. This situation could lead to some upward adjustment in prices that farmers pay for industrial inputs and services. The Polish caloric intake (over 3,000 calories per day) is among the highest in Communist Eastern Europe and compares favorably with that of the United States. The share of starches in the diet, however, is considerably higher than in most other 0 northern European countries, and the share of meat; dairy products (except milk), fruits, and vegetables is correspondingly lower. Demand for pork his exceeded supplies since 1968; per capita annual meat consumption increased nearly 4 kilograms between 1968 and 1971 to 56 kilograms. By 1975, meat consumption is planned to rise to 63 kilograms per capita. b. Fisheries Poland's fishing fleet has almost tripled in size since 1960, reaching 141,700 gross register tons in 1071. Coastal and deep -sea fishing netted a new high of 488,500 tons of fish in 1971 mainly cod and herring� nearly 3 times the catch in 1960. All of this increase was. derived from Atlantic Ocean catches. In addition, commercial fisheries caught 13,600 tons of fresh -carter fish. The total catch of fish in 1972 was 520,400 metric tons. Polish exports of fish averaged about 53,000 tons annually during 1969 -71, compared with only 7,000 tons in 1950. Imports of fish �about 40% from the U.S.S.R� amounted to 13,400 tons in 1971. Per capita consumption of fish was 5.7 kilograms in 1971, among the highest in Eastern Europe. e. Forestry Forests covered about 8.5 million hectares in 1971, or more than one fourth of Poland's land area (Figure 11). More than 80% of the forest land is under state. control. Timber resources, maii.ly coniferous wood, are adequate for domestic needs and have ''jeen an important source of hard currency earnings. Since 1965, the annual timber cut has ranged between 16.4 million and 18.5 million cubic meters. Sizable timber exports have been achieved by cutting timber at a rate in excess of natural growth and by holding down domestic use. Exports of sawn wood were a record 952,000 cubic meters in 1964, but they dropped to 820,000 cubic meters in 1970 and 714,000 cubic meters in 1971. Most of the sawn wood has been sold to Western countries. In recent years sales of timber, furniture, and paper accounted for about 5% of Poland's total hard currency earnings. Poland imports some cellulose for its paper and textile industries. 2. Fuels and power (U /OU) a. Hard coal and coke Poland is one of the world's largest producers of both hard coa1 and coke. Output of hard coal in 1971 reached 145 million tons, and coke production 'By definition, hard coal includes both bituminous and anthracite coals. According to the international standard, hard coal is defined as coal having a gross calorific value of more than 5,701; kilocalories per kilogram on a moist, ash -free basis. APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 amounted to about 17 million tons. Coal production in Poland has increased steadily throughout the postwar period, because of a shortage of other fuels, especially crude oil, and because of strong demand for coal on international markets. Since 1970, ;coal production has increased by 5 million to 6 million tons (about 4 per year, and the planned growth rate through 1975 is the same. Four- fifths of the hard coal output is consumed domestically, and one -fifth is exported. Coal has been an important source of foreign exchange since the end of World War II. In 1571, coal exports totaling 30 million tons earned the equivalent of more than US$400 million, $220 million of which was in hard currency. About one -half of the exports have been going to the Communist countries, mainly the U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Hungary. Major importers in the non Communist world have been Italy, France, Finland, Denmark, Japan, and Austria. Coking coal exports amounted to about 6 million tons, or 20% of total.exports of hard coal, in 1971. Growing Western concern over air pollution should help keep the demand high for low sulfur Polish coal. Poland imports about 1 million tons of high -grade coking coal per year, most of it from the Urbanized or industrialized area Forest AGRICULTURE Oats, potatoes, livestock Rye, potatoes, livestock Wheat, sugar beets, livestock U.S.S.R. Approximately 2 million tons of coke are exported annually. Major recipients are the U.S.S.R. and East Germany. Polish hard coal is nearly all bituminous and is extracted almost exclusively from deep mines. Reserves are concentrated in the Upper and Lower Silesian basins along the Polish- Czechoslovak border and in the newly- discovered coal basin in eastern Poland between Lublin and the Polish Soviet bt;rder. Total possible reserves are estimated at about 100 billion tons to a depth of 1,000 meters and 150 billion tons to a depth of 2,000 meters. Hard coal is by far the most important source of primary energy in Poland, although its share is declining slowly.

The patter of fuel consumption in Poland differs sharply from the world pattern, in which coal and petroleum each account for about one -third of total consumption. Output of fuels and power is shown in Figure 12. In the early 1950's, the regime tried to increase coal production rapidly with a minimum of investment, relying on forced labor, overtime work, and the use of military personnel in mining. Since 1956, coal mining has received much greater emphasis in Poland's investment program, and large expenditures have gone into both the construction of new manes and the modernization of old ones. The production of coking coal has received special attention, and its share of the hard coal output has increased from about 1.5% in 1950 to 25% in 1971. The showcase of the Polish coal industry is an automated coal mine opened in Katowice in 1968. The Jan mine, named after Minister of Mining Jan Mitrega, operates with a handpicked staff of 160 miners and 69 engineers. It combines modern equipment- including computers-with up -to -date techniques, and serves as a training ground for mining specialists from all over Poland. By Polish standards, production results claimed at the mine have been impressive: 15 tons per man -day, as compared with an average of about 3 tons in other Polish mines. b. Brown coal Poland has large deposits of brown coal, located mainly in two areas: the Turow Basin in southwestern Poland near the Pol6ii -East German border, and the Konin -Turek Basin in the eastern part of Poznan province. A major new brown coal deposit was recently discovered in Belchatow, about 40 kilometers south of Lodz. Development of a mine in this area is expected to begin in 1976. 'For diacritics on place names see the list of names on the apron of the Summary Map in the Country Profile chapter and the map itself. Brown coal mining on a significant scale was initiated in 1956; since then output has been rising rapidly. The output of 34.5 million tons in 1971 was almost six tames the 1955 output. Part of the financing of brown coal development has come from East Germany, through credits repayable in deliveries of brown and hard coal. Most Polish brown coal is used in powerplants. e. Petroleum and natural gas Poland imports all but a small fraction if its supply of crude oil. In 1972, domestic production amounted to only about �347,000 tons. Extensive geological surveys are still conducted with Soviet assistance, but no major fields have been found in recent years, and prospects for greatly increased domestic production are not bright. Ir_ fact, production has declined during the past four years. Crude oil imports, all from the U.S. S. R., totaled 9.7 million tons in 1972. In order to meet long deferred needs, Poland doubled its imports during 1961 -63, 1964 -65, and again during 1966 -69. Imports will probably continue to increase rapidly through 1975. Because the U.S.S.R. may not be relied upon to continue supplying increasing amounts of crude to meet future Polish needs, Poland is seeking to import oil from the Middle East. Agreements were reached in 1973 with Iran and Iraq to supply crude oil. Crude oil is processed at the major refining and petroleum complex at Plock, about 75 miles northwest of Warsaw. The refinery, which began operating in August 1964, had a capacity of 2 million tons in 1966 and about 7 million to 8 million tons at the end of 1972. The present capacity of the Plock complex represents one -third of the planned size of the works. Oil from the U.S.S.R. is brought to the refinery via the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA) pipeline, v.hich crosses Poland from the U.S.S.R. to East 'Cermany. The 24 -inch pipeline, completed in December 1963, has been joined by a parallel 28 -inch line which was recently completed. 10 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 Construction is now in progress, under a contract with Snam Progetti of Italy, on a major new petroleum refinery at Gdansk. The refinery, scheduled to be completed in 1975, will be supplied with 3 million tons of crude oil annually from Kuwait under a long- term contract with British Petroleum. Plans are also being made for the construction of a third major refinery, to be located at Blachownia Slaska in southern Poland; this plant is to have an annual crude charge capacity of 6 million tons when completed in 1977. Crude oil may be supplied to it from the Middle East via a pipeline through Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The rapid expansion of refining capacity has made it possible for Poland to increase output of petroleum products from 876,000 tons in 1960 to 10.0 million tons in 1972. In the latter year, Poland produced about 80% of its supply of kerosene, fuel oils, and lubricating oils, as compared with only 30% in 1964. Sizable natural gas deposits discovered in recent years in the Carpathian foothills, and the promise of still greater discoveries, have encouraged the leadership to emphasize natural gas in the country's fuel baiance. Since 1960, gas production has risen rapidly, from 0.5 billion cubic meters to 5.8 billion cubic meters in 1972. A further increase in natural gas production to between 12 billion and 13 billion cubic meters by 1975 is planned. In 1968, reported gas reserves were on the order of 40 billion cubic meters. Since then, estimates have been revised sharply upward to 100 billion cubic meters or more. Several major pipelines have become operative and others are under construction. The most important line now in operation links the Rzeszow area, Poland's largest gas basin, with the fertilizer plant at Pulawy and extends to Lublin and Warsaw. d. Electric power The electric power industry has grown steadily throughout the postwar period, with particularly rapid increases occurring in the 1960's and early 1970's. Since 1960 the national electric power capacity nearly tripled, and Poland now ranks first in the Communist East European area in electric power generating capacity and production. Production in 1972 amounted to 76.4 billion kilowatt -hours (kw. -hr.). At the end of that year, the installed generating capacity was 16.1 million kilowatts (kw.). In 1971, the electric power industry accounted for 12.6% of Poland's fixed assets and 2.6% of the country's gross industrial output. Industry consumes two thirds of the total electric power output. The chemical and metallurgical sectors are the principal industrial consumers of electricity, using 47% of the total industrial allocation. Other principal industrial consumers are the fuel, metalworking, wood and paper, textile, and food industries. The remaining electricity is allocated to households, commercial and governmental establish- ments, and the transport, agricu!tural, and public utility sectors of the economy. All urban areas have household electricity, and by 1971 all state farms and most private farms were electrified. Thermal powerplants account for 95% of the total electric power cayacrty, and hydroelectric plants, the remainder. Thermal powerplants are fueled almost exclusively by domestic hard coal and brown coal. .almost one -half of the capacity is in the south central part of the country, where the largest concentrath of industry, the greatest urban density, and most of the hard coal mines are located. The largest powerplants, all thermal, are the 2- million -kw. Turoszow Turow, the 1.2- million -kw. Laziska Gome, and the 1.2- million-kw. Patnow. The combined capacity of these three powerplants comprises about 28% of the total national capacity. Use of waterpower is limited because most of the rivers have small volumes of flow and the predominantly flat terrain would require a consider- able expenditure of resources for dams to impound large reservoirs. Transmission of electric power is accomplished by a national network encompassing 460,000 kilometers of transmission lines, including more than 5,700 kilometers of extra -high voltage (220 and 400 kv.) lines. High voltage transmission lines cover a considerable portion of the country, connecting all important powerplants and providing service to the principal industrial and urban centers. The greatest density of transmission facil :es is in the south central part of the country, which includes the Upper Silesian Basin. The highest voltage transmission line (400 kv.) extends to this area from the large Turoszow Turow powerplant in the southwest. The distribution system ai!ows for exchanges of electricity with Czecho- slovakia, East Germany, and the U.S.S.R. These exchanges have local significance in the border areas but have little effect on the national power supply. Future development of the electric power base calls for an increase in generating capacity to about 20.5 million kw., with an annual production of 96 billion kw. -!a. by the end of 1975. The planned increase is to be accomplished primarily through construction and expansion of thermal powerplants. Two of the thermal plants under construction, the Kozienice and Gryfino Dolna Odra, are in the 1- million -kw. class. The largest 11 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 generating units in use have a capacity of 200,000 kw. Until recently, units of this size were imported from the U.S.S.R.; however, domestic industry now produces units of this size, and research has begun on the manufacture of 500,000 -kw. units. The first 500,000 -kw. unit is to be installed in 1975 or 1976 and will be imported from the U.S.S.R. Poland has recently announced plans to build its first nuclear powerplant. Scheduled to have a capacity of 444,000 kw., it is expected to be operational by 1982. 3. Metals and minerals (C) a. Ferrous metallurgy Poland has the largest iron and steel industry in the East European Communist area (excluding the U.S.S.R.) and the tenth largest in the world, ranking slightly behind Belgium. In 1972, the ndustry produced about 7.5 million tons of pig iron, 13.5 million tons of crude steel, and 9.2 million tons of rolled products. With the exception of coking coal, the industry is dependent on imports for most of its raw materials. Although there are relatively large iron ore deposits, they are difficult to mine and have an average iron content of only 34 From a peak level of about 3.0 million tons during 1966 -68, domestic iron ore production decreased steadily to 1.8 million tons in 1972. In the latter year, imports of iron ore, about 85� %0 of which came from the U.S.S.R., amounted to 12.5 million tons. Although the U.S.S.R. will continue to be its principal supplier, Poland plans to increase imports of iron ore from other current suppliers, Mcluding Brazil, Sweden, and India, to help cover its growing needs. Poland depends on imports for all alloying metals and ores for the production of ferroalloys. The Polish iron and steel industry is located mainly in the Katowice- Krakow area in the southern part of the country (Figure 13). The province of Katowice contains a cluster of about a dozen plants which, in 1971, employed 105,000 workers or 60% of the industry's labor force and accounted for 5.9 millit n tons of crude steel and 4.0 million tons of rolled products, each representing 46% of the industry's output. The largest single enterprise is the Lenin Metallurgical Plant, located at Nowa Huta, near Krakow. This integrated combine, which began production in 1955, had a labor force of 27,000 and an output of 5.3 million tons of crude steel and 3.4 million tons of rolled steel in 1971. Total Polish output of iron and steel, as well as other important metals and minerals, is shown in Figure M.

Most of the outlays went into the construction of new facilities, including the Lenin plant. The rate of investment in iron and steel was progressively reduced after 1955, however, to 9.6% of total industrial investment during 1956 -60, 8.3% ,luring 1961 -65, and 6.5% during 1966 -70. In spite of this !owered priority, the industry has maintained a steady rate of growth by concentrating investment on the elimination of bottlenecks and the expansion of existing facilities, particularly for the production of such items as cold rolled strip and sheet, tinplate, galvanized sheet, and wire. On balance, however, results have not been entirely satisfactory. The industry is still geared predominantly to the making of steel by the traditional open hearth method. Poland's only oxygen- converter steel mill was put into operation in 1966, and the output of steel by this method in 1972 was only one -fifth of total output, a very low share compared with more advanced steel producing countries. Even though Poland normally exports more steel than it imports, exports are generally weighted heavily with such low -value items as rails, heavy plate, and semifinished products, Whereas imports include a larger share of high -value items such as alloy steel, light flat rolled products, and special tubular steels. Poland has embarked on an ambitious program of expansion and modernization of its steel industry during the 1970's. Planned investments during 1971- 75 total 50 billion zlotys, or twice as much as in the 1966 -70 period. Production of crude steel is scheduled to reach 15 million tens by 1975, and the quality and :assortment of products are to be improved substantially. In the latter half of the decade a large integrated combine, now under construction, is to be put into operation in the Katowice area, with an annual crude steel capacity of 4.5 million tons. It will be equipped with large modern blast furnaces and oxygen converters A principal product will be semifinished steel for use in nearby plants, where rolling and finishing capacities are to be expanded and diversified. b. Nonferrous metallurgy Although generally small by world standards, Poland's nonferrous metals industries are among the largest in Eastern Europe. In the domestic economy these industries rank considerably behind the Polish iron and steel industry in terms of employment and value of annual output. In 1971, employment in nonferrous metallurgy amounted to about 57,000, or about one -third of that of ferrous metallurgy; the value of output in nonferrous metallurgy was nearly 36 billion zlotys, or 40% of that of ferrous metallurgy. Poland ranks ninth among world pri- Jucers of zinc but is second only to the U.S..R. among all Communist countries. Its output s more than adequate for domestic needs. In 1972, Poland produced 228,000 tons of zinc and exported 97,000 tons of zinc and zinc plate. Nearly all of Poland's zinc 13 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 output is derived from domestic zinc -lead ores; the remainder is obtained from concentrates imported mainly from non- Communist countries, including the United States. Total output of zinc -lead ores was about 4.0 million tons in 1972. The relatively small amount of lead contained in these ores is the basis for the production of metallic lead, supplemented occasionally by small imports of lead concentrates. The traditional source of Polish zinc, the sulfide ores of the Bytom Basin, is being exhausted, and a growing share of the national output is being derived from oxide ores in the Olkusz�Chrzanow region, where a highly mechanized mine is under development at Pomorzany. About one -third of the current metal output is refined by old, horizontal retort plants, some of which were built in the last century. Although no definite schedule has been established, the retorting methods are to be replaced by modern processes. Considerably greater use is planned for the Imperial Smelting Process, which currently accounts for about one -sixth of total zinc output. The process was adopted in 1968 in a new refinery at Miasteczko Slaskie, near Katowice. Difficulties were encountered in mastering the new process, but these reportedly have been overcome. The electrolytic process, which accounts for nearly one -half of current zinc output, may also see greater use. Domestic lead output 65,000 tons in 1972� covers about three quarters of domestic consumption. The remainder is supplied by imports of metallic lead, mainly from the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, and the United Kingdom. Cadmium, a coproduet of zinc ore, is produced in excess of domestic requirements and is exported to other Communist countries and to the West. Production of refined copper has increased by no less than 500% between 1960 and 1972, from 22,000 tons to 131,000 tons. Poland is the largest producer of copper among the Communist countries of Eastern Europe., and by 1975 it is expected to attain an annual output of 200,000 tons. This level of production will enable Poland to rneet its domestic needs, now rising rapidly in the electrical and telecommunications sectors, and will provide a sizable export surplus. Poland's objective is to become a major world producer of copper. Polish planners already are seeking foreign financial assistance to develop an industry capable of producing tip to 600,000 tons of copper annually. The rapid _owth already achieved in copper production and the potential for future expansion derive from the dis, Overy of rich copper ore deposits in southwestern Poland in the late 1950's, which are 14 estimated to be the seventh- largest in the world. Two major mines, financed ip part by a US$125 million credit from Czechoslovakia, were opened in 1966 at Glogow and Lubin to exploit these deposits. Substantial progress also has been ,Wade in the development of a third major mine at Rudna. This project, which has been helped vlong by a multimillion dollar long -term credit from France, is scheduled for completion in 1974. The volume of copper ore mined in Poland in 1972 was estimated at more than 10 million tons, and the planned output for 1975 is 14.5 million tons. Smelting and refining aperations are carried out at Glogow and Legnica. Poland's production of aluminum is small by world standards and ranks second to that of Romania in Eastern Europe. Output in 1972 amounted to 102,000 tons, or enough to cover roughly two- thirds of domestic needs. Imports from the U.S.S.R. made up the deficit. Although years of research have been devoted to the development of techmyltes to obtain aluminum from domestic clays, only limited experimental use has been made of such techniques, and Poland remains dependent on imports for its aluminum raw materials. Some bauxite is imported from Hungary and Guinea for domestic processing into alumina, but most local requirements for alumina are met by imports, principally from Hungary. A contract has been signet with Yugoslavia calling for annual deliveries to Poland of 120,000 tons of alumina over a 10 -year period, beginning in 1976. Poland has two aluminum reduction plants, each with an annual capacity of about 50,000 tons. One plant, located at Skawina, was built with Soviet assistance and was put into operatimi in 1954. A newer plant, employing French refining technology, was put into operation at Konin in 1966. Because of its location in a nonindustrial area, operations at the latter plant were hampered for some time by a manpower shortage particularly of skilled techni- cians needed to supervise the French process. Although these problems have been overcome, Poland has not gone ahead with its initial plans to expand capacity at Konin to 100,000 tons per year, due apparently to the lack to low -cost electric power (the use of lignite, the fuel source for the required additional power, apparently would he uneconomi- cal). c. Nonmetallic minerals and construction materials Poland has the third richest deposits of native sulfur in the world. The deposits, discovered during 1953 -56 at Tarnobrzeg, contain about 100 million tons of pure APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 sulfur. Sulfur mining in Poland began on a significant scale in 1961. Since then, output of elemental sulfur has increased rapidly to about 3.0 million tons in 1972. By 1975, output may reach 5 million tons, a level currently exceeded only by the Unite% States. Favorable geological conditions permit much of the incremental output to be mined by the highly efficient Frasch process. Sulfur exports have kept pace with domestic production and have become a major source of foreign exchange. Exports increased from 241,000 tons in 1965 to 1.8 million tons in 1970, 2.1 million tons in 1971, and, according to a preliminary report, 2.5 million tons in 1972. By 1975, Western experts estimate Poland will be exporting about 4 million tons per year. At present, more than 75% of the exports go to non Communist countries. Salt is found in abundance in Poland, and a small amount is exported annually. The country has only small resources of other nonmetallic minerals, and depends on imports for its entire supply of potash and all but a small fraction of its supply of phosphate rock. Poland has extended credits to the U.S.S.R. for the development of Soviet potash and is being repaid in deliveries of this material during 1970 -80. The arrangement has resulted in the U.S.S.R.'s replacing East Germany as Poland's principal source of potash. Poland also receives large annual deliveries of apatite concentrates from the U.S.S.R. Poland produces a wide variety of construction materials. The 1972 production of nearly 14 million metric tons of cement resulted in Poland ranking as the eleventh largest world producer and the largest among the East European countries. Cement output is inadequate to meet Polish demand, however, even though output has been growing at approximately a 7% annual rate for several years. The shortage has compelled Poland to become a net importer of cement, which is purchased primarily from the Soviet Union, although limited quantities are exported primarily to East European countries. This cement shortage should eventually be alleviated by the futurf completion of what will be the two largest Polish cement plants. The larger of these two plants is to receive its kilns and other equipment from the Soviet Union and is scheduled to begin production in 1976. Construction on the smaller one is expected to commence during 1973. The production of cement, as well as othe, construction materials, is shown in Figure 14. Poland produces sufficient quantities of lime and plaster to satisfy the needs of its construction industry. Since 1970, the output of lime for construction and industry has grown annually at a rate exceeding 6 The output of wall materials has increased fairly steadily at a slower pace than lime, although the growth rate of production of brick wall materials has been suLstantially less than all wall materials considered together. Poland has adequate clay resources to support increased brick production, but has invested relatively little in the expansion of brick capacity, which reflects a Polish preference for substitute wall mated; 's. Finally, the production of burnt tiles has continued its secular decline. In addition to cement, Poland carries on international trade in several construction materials. It has been a net exporter of window glass for several years, although in recent years this market has failed to grow. Poland's largest window glass customer is the United States, which has purchased a growing proportion of window glass exports. Other construc- tion materials exported by Poland include limestone, dolomite, fire clay, gypsum stone, gypsum cement, lime, and clay brick. Several construction materials are imported however, such as limestone, dolomite, kaolin, graphite, asbestos, asbestos cement, brick facing tile, and pre -cast concrete. 4. Manufacturing and construction (C) a. Machine building Machine building is Poland's largest industry, accounting for 27% of total industrial output in 1971. As the focal point of Poland's industrialization efforts throughout the postwar period, machine building has been accorded top priority in the allocation of investments, skilled labor, materials, and the best available management. Although the share of total investment going into machine building declined somewhat after 1955, the industry (including metal processing) still received about 15% of total industrial investment during 1956 -65. This share increased to 19% during 1966 -70. The gross value of output increased over 300% between 1960 and 1971. Exports increased even more rapidly than production. In spite of the rapid growth of its machine building industry, however, Poland remains highly dependent on imports for complex modern machinery. The Polish machine building industry produces a wide variety of p�ducts. Transportation equipment including railroad locomotives and cars, ships, and automotive equipment� accounted for about 34% of total output in the industry in 1971. \"Electrotechnical equipment,\" the term used by the Poles to describe such items as generators, transformers, cables, and electronic equipment, comprised 17% of total 15 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 FIGURE 15.

Production of selected items of the machine building industry is shown in Figure 15. Throughout the postwar period, Poland has been an important producer of railroad locomotives and rolling stock. It is second only to the U.S.S.R. in the production of freight cars in the Communist world. Although production declined c ,ring the 1966 -70 plan period, by 1971 output had nearly recovered to the peak level of 16,600 units produced in 1966. Generally, about two- fifths of the freight car output is exported, predominantly to the Soviet Union. Until 1960, Poland produced and exported large numbers of steam locomotives, first to the U.S.S.R. and later to the Peoples' Republic of China. Since 1961, however, it has been building mainly diesel and electric locomotives for domestic use. Poland ranks twelfth in the world in shipbuilding. Among Communist countries it is second only to tl :e Soviet Union. Output at Polish shipyards- confined mainly to three maior yards at Gdynia, Gdansk, and Szczecin (Stettin) almost quadruplet!. during 1955 -66 (to 433,000 d.w.t.) and increased another 62% through 1972 (to 700,800 d. w. t. The rapid growth in shipbuilding capacity has enabled Poland to increase the size of its own merchant fleet to i 2 million d.w.t. and to sell a considerable number of ships abroad. About 75% of Polish- manufactured ships are exported, mainly to the U.S.S.R. During 1960 -70, th. Soviet Union purchased 77% of total Polish exports of ships, representing an aggregate capacity of 2,331,000 d.w.t. The Poles now claim that every fifth ship in the Soviet nonmilitary fleet is Polish- built. In 1971, the number of ships delivered to the U.S.S.R. dropped sharply, while sales to the industrial West -which had been negligible totaled 229,000 d.w.t., of which 119,000 d.w.t. went to Norway and 64,000 d. w. t. went to West Germany. Polish shipyards build and export a variety of small to medium -class ships, including ore and coal carriers, tramps, coasters, general cargo, timber carriers, tankers, cutters, factory trawlers, training ships, and scientific research vessels. So far, the largest ship launched is a 55,000 -ton general cargo vessel.

Poland has a small but rapidly expanding motor vehicle industry. In 1971, the industry manufactured 90,000 passenger cars, 49,600 trucks, 9,900 buses, 41,200 tractors, and 176,600 motorcycles and motor scooters. 16 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 1965 1968 1969 1970 1971 Metalworking machine tools (thousand units) 34.5 33.0 33.4 33.4 na Mining machinery 164.0 175.0 191.0 201.0 na Metallurgical equipment 40.1 43.2 43.6 47.4 46.3 Chemical machinery. 57.3 57.8 62.1 68.4 no Construction and roadbuhding equipment. 46.9 77.6 92.3 107.0 109.0 Food- processing equipment............. 43.2 54.5 57.4 56.9 48.6 Textile machinery..................... 17.0 16.3 17.4 18.6 20.2 Agricultural machinery, excluding tractors (thousand zlotys\") 3,630.0 4,344.0 5,118.0 5,547.2 6,287.0 Tractors, two -axle (thousand units) 20.6 29.9 36.7 39.5 41.2 Roller bearings (million units) 34.1 42.2 45.4 51.4 na Electric rotary engines (1,000 kw.) 4,533.0 5,649.0 6,684.0 7,429.0 7,391.0 Transformers over 20 kv: a.

Production of selected items of the machine building industry is shown in Figure 15. Throughout the postwar period, Poland has been an important producer of railroad locomotives and rolling stock. It is second only to the U.S.S.R. in the production of freight cars in the Communist world. Although production declined c ,ring the 1966 -70 plan period, by 1971 output had nearly recovered to the peak level of 16,600 units produced in 1966. Generally, about two- fifths of the freight car output is exported, predominantly to the Soviet Union. Until 1960, Poland produced and exported large numbers of steam locomotives, first to the U.S.S.R. and later to the Peoples' Republic of China. Since 1961, however, it has been building mainly diesel and electric locomotives for domestic use. Poland ranks twelfth in the world in shipbuilding. Among Communist countries it is second only to tl :e Soviet Union. Output at Polish shipyards- confined mainly to three maior yards at Gdynia, Gdansk, and Szczecin (Stettin) almost quadruplet!. during 1955 -66 (to 433,000 d.w.t.) and increased another 62% through 1972 (to 700,800 d. w. t. The rapid growth in shipbuilding capacity has enabled Poland to increase the size of its own merchant fleet to i 2 million d.w.t. and to sell a considerable number of ships abroad. About 75% of Polish- manufactured ships are exported, mainly to the U.S.S.R. During 1960 -70, th. Soviet Union purchased 77% of total Polish exports of ships, representing an aggregate capacity of 2,331,000 d.w.t. The Poles now claim that every fifth ship in the Soviet nonmilitary fleet is Polish- built. In 1971, the number of ships delivered to the U.S.S.R. dropped sharply, while sales to the industrial West -which had been negligible totaled 229,000 d.w.t., of which 119,000 d.w.t. went to Norway and 64,000 d. w. t. went to West Germany. Polish shipyards build and export a variety of small to medium -class ships, including ore and coal carriers, tramps, coasters, general cargo, timber carriers, tankers, cutters, factory trawlers, training ships, and scientific research vessels. So far, the largest ship launched is a 55,000 -ton general cargo vessel. The Gdynia shipyard started construction of a 105,000 -ton vessel in 1972 and has b preparations to build a larger building dock, where 200,000 -ton and 400,000 ton vessels are eventually to be built. Poland has a small but rapidly expanding motor vehicle industry. In 1971, the industry manufactured 90,000 passenger cars, 49,600 trucks, 9,900 buses, 41,200 tractors, and 176,600 motorcycles and motor scooters. 16 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 To reduce a growing backlog of demand and to boost foreign sales of motor vehicles, Poland in 1967 embarked on a major program to expand and modernize its capacity for manufacturing passenger cars. The program has centered on the renovation of production facilities at the Fabryka Samochodtow Osc-bowych plant at Zeran on the banks of the Vistula near Warsaw. In 1971 the Zeran plant turned out about 60,000 \"Polish Fiats,\" the Polish version of the Fiat 125. In October 1971, Poland signed a cooperation agreement with Fiat for the construction in Poland of a new model car, the Fiat 126, a relatively low- priced small car, which will be produced in new facilities at Bielsko -Biala and Tychy. About 75% of the Italian supplies of equipment for the plant are to be repaid by deliveries of Fiat 126 components produced in Poland. Annual production is to begin at 3,000 units in 1973 and is to reach 150,000 units by 1979. Poland hopes to boost the total number of automobiles per 1,000 inhabitants from 15 in 1970 to 25 in 1975. Western technology is playing an increasingly important role in the Polish motor vehicle industry. In addition to the new Fiat deal, Poland has recently signed an agreement with the French firm of Berliet for the modernization of the Jelcz bus plant. The capacity of the plant eventually will be expanded to 5,000 buses annually, of which 1,700 will be produced under the Berliet license. The assembly of buses began in December 1972, largely from imported com- ponents. By 1975, more than one -half of the parts are to be made in Poland. Licenses purchased before 1970 include Weber carburetors, Leyland diesel. engines for trucks, Armstrong shock absorbers, and Westinghouse brakes. Large amounts of agricultural machinery, mainly for domestic use, are produced in Poland. The country also exports and imports some items, including tractors and harvesters. Branches of the machine building industry that produced agricultural equipment received a high priority during 1966 -70 in order to support the high rate of investment and mechaniza- tion in agriculture. Poland currently is upgrading certain types of tractors and combines with the installation of high compression Leyland ent!ines, manufactured under license. Poland produces much of its own mining, metallurgical, and construction equipment as well as textile machinery. It also exports a number of items in these categories, but it still depends on imports for many types of modern special purpose equipment. It buys such items as giant conveyors from East Germany, truck mounted cranes from Czecho- slovakia, and modern textile machinery from Western Europe. Production sharing ventures with Jones Cranes and Cole Cranes of the United Kingdom, Stetter of West Germany, Steyr Daimler -Puch of Austria, and Koehring International and International Harvester of the United States provide for cooperation in the production of heavy -duty cranes, concrete mixers, trucks for construction sites, hydraulic building machinery, and heavy tractors and crawlers. Poland also has imported a considerable amount of chemical machinery. Throughout the 1960's a high priority was given to expansion of the chemical industry, and Poland imported chemical equipment fro.a Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and the U.S.S.R., as well as from Western countries, particularly West Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Poland has traditionally been an important manufacturer of machine tools, producing abou, 350 different types in 1971. Many of the tools lack the precision, fine tolerances, and durability of Western tools, however, and others seem to be over- engineered. Nevertheless, almost one -half of all types of machine tools are exported, and machine tools are almost the only type of machinery and equipment for which the Poles have developed a steady export market in the industrial West. Since 1965, a growing number of agreements have been signed with Western industrial firms in the hope of improving the country's ability to sell machinery outside the Communist countries. Some agreements provide for Poland to manufacture certain items of machinery under Western license. In other cases, Poland has contracted to produce components of complete installations to be sold jointly with Western firms. Poland produces sizable quantities of military equipment for its own use and for export to the U.S.S.R. It is the second- largest producer of conventional armaments among the East European Communist countries, after Czechoslovakia. Poland manufactures tanks, armored personnel carriers, military aircraft, medium landing ships, submarine chasers, and naval auxiliaries. The country also imports large amounts of military equipment from the U.S.S.R., the value of which was estimated at between $175 million and $200 million in 1971. b. Chemicals The Polish chemical industry produces a wide variety of products, ranging from basic chemicals to more sophisticated goods such as chemical fibers, synthetic rubber, and pharmaceuticals (Figure 16). The industry has been granted a high priority in 17 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200070030 -5 FIGURE 16.

During 1961 -71, this share amounted to dacron, has been growing rapidly, while the production of rayon has remained about the same about 14 The output of the chemical industry has increased rapidly. In 1971, it was more than 18 times that of 1950 and twice that of 1965. The industry has been exceeded in its rate of growth only by the machine building industry. In 1971 the chemical industry accounted for 9% of total industrial output, compared with 1.6% in 1950 and 5.5% in 1960. Poland produces large amounts of sulfuric acid, synthetic ammonia, nitric acid, caustic soda, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid. Recent emphasis has been placed on increasing the production of fertilizers to support agriculture and also for export, and on the development of a large -scale petrochemical industry to provide the basis for an increased output of plastics, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubber. Petrochemical facilities at the Plock refinery have started production, using petroleum from the U.S.S.R. Poland's natural gas deposits may also be used for petrochemical production. Poland is by far the largest producer of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1971, the output of nitrogenous Fertilizer was nearly three times as large as in 1965, and the output of phosphatic fertilizer was twice as great. Phosphates and apatite from the U.S.S.R. are used in making phosphatic fertilizer. The entire supply of potash fertilizer is imported, mainly from the U.S.S.R. and East Germany. Spain and West Germany supply smaller amounts. Poland produces more than 80% of the chemical fibers used domestically. More than half of the 18 since 1965. Poland started producing synthetic rubber in 1959. By 1971, output covered more than 40% of domestic consumption. In 1965, Poland purchased a plant of Western origin to produce butadiene for use in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, thus eliminating the need to import this material. Production of plastics has been increasing rapidly. Output in 1971 was 2.6 times that of 1965, with the production of polyvinyl chloride _-ore than tripling. Polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polystyrene together made up 52% of the output in 1971. c. Light industry Light industry, including textiles, clothing and footwear, leather and fur processing, woodworking, and paper processing, represented almost 18% of gross industrial output in Poland in 1971. Output in this sector has grown far less rapidly than in the machinery and chemical industries. Several branches of light industry were well developed before World War II, especially the textile industry, which was the focal point of Poland's industrialization in the late 191h century. Throughout the postwar period, however, light industry has been neglected in the distribution of investments, materials, and skilled management. During 1960 -65, all branches of light industry together received only 8.3% of total industrial investment; this share was raised to 9.8% during 1966 -71.

Most investment has gone into the expansion of plants and equipment. The level of technology and the quality of output in Polish light industry are low compared with those of Western countries. Few items produced are attractive enough car are of sufficiently high quality to be sold profitably in developed Western countries. Many items sold in the industrial West can be marketed only at unprofitably low prices; thus, the bulk of Poland's light industry exports go to other Communist countries. Principal exports are clothing, footwear, textiles, and furniture. Th. -ow quality of output has also been a problem in the domestic market; it has discouraged the growth of sales beyond essential requirements and resulted in a rapid accumulation of stocks, particularly of clothing and household articles, during the 1960's. The Polish Government recognizes that the assortment, design, and quality of light industry goods must be improved if the country is to increase its exports and sell more profitably to the industrial West, meet increasing Soviet demand for high quality consumer goods, and raise the level of living of the Polish population. The regime has already taken steps to encourage better marketing abroad. Restrictions on the use of labor have been removed, and export enterprises are being given easy access to investment funds for those opportunities that promise a quick return in foreign currency. d. Food processing The output of the large and diversified food processing industry accounted for about 18% of total industrial output in 1971. Its relative importance has declined considerably since 1950, when it accounted for about one -third of Poland's industrial output. Throughout the postwar period, growth of output in food processing, which is closely linked to the growth of agricultural production, has been the slowest of all sectors of industry except coal mining. In 1969, Poland exported 14% of its total output of foodstuffs of animal origin and 6% of its output of foodstuffs of vegetable origin. In 1971, "
