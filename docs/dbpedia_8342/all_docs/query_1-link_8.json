        "text": "Producers of European statistics â€“ ONAs (Other National Authorities) are an integral part of the national and European Statistical System (ESS) and therefore, according to the Act on Official Statistics should comply with the European Statistics Code of Practice (ESCoP). ONAs are responsible for ensuring the quality of the statistics they produce and have the possibility to submit data directly to Eurostat.\n\nNot all institutions included in the Polish ONAs list submit data to Eurostat on their own or publish statistical data produced. In some cases, the transmission of data, in accordance with national arrangements, is done via Statistics Poland. Their dissemination in the national statistical system may also take place in publications and databases of the National Statistical Institute (GUS). For the convenience of users, reference is made below to the ONAs statistical products that are publicly available on ONAs websites (they might be available in Polish only).\n\nOther National Authorities responsible in the Polish Statistical System for development, production and dissemination of European Statistics:"
