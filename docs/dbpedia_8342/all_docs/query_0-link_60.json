        "text": "2024\n\nNew certificates for non-degree postgraduate studies and specialised training\n\n5 August 2024\n\nThe Minister of Science and Higher Education has signed an amendment to the regulation on documents issued in connection with the course or completion of non-degree postgraduate studies and specialised training. The new regulations will come into force on 1 October 2024.\n\nPursuant to the Act of 20 July 2018 the Law on Higher Education and Science, the provider of postgraduate studies and specialised training independently determines the templates for certificates of completion of such studies. The new regulations introduce changes to these documents indicating the necessary elements that must be included in the certificate. They will enter into force on 1 October 2024.\n\nNow certificates will have to include more information i.e.:\n\n1. the start and end dates of the postgraduate course,\n\n2. the number of hours of online courses and the number of ECTS credits allocated to those courses,\n\n3. information on the location of the practical placement (if any),\n\n4. information on training for a relevant profession or obtaining professional qualifications (if applicable),\n\n5. for persons preparing for the teaching profession: confirmation that the studies completed have prepared them for the teaching profession, with an indication of the subject or type of courses they can teach.\n\nIn addition, certificates will include the number of practical placement hours. The possibility of including printed information instead of the stamp of the person signing the certificate has also been introduced to facilitate preparation of the documents.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the quality of education, enable better evaluation of the course of study and provide graduates with more detailed certificates that can be valid for employers or professional qualification authorities.\n\nNational Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) and the Polish Academy of Science (PAN) - legislative work in progress\n\n11 July 2024\n\nThe following bills were added to the list of legislative work of the Council of Ministers: on amending the Act on the National Centre for Research and Development, the Act on the Polish Academy of Sciences and on the liquidation of the Copernicus Academy.\n\nNational Centre for Research and Development\n\nThe purpose of the proposed act is to introduce necessary procedural changes and to improve the functioning of the institutions supervised by the minister responsible for higher education and science and research institutes. The changes mainly concern the mode of appointment and dismissal, and the composition of the management bodies of supervised institutions, as well as the qualifications of persons performing the functions of director and deputy director in research institutes, and the financing of research institutes.\n\nThe key issues to be resolved are the matters related to the Minister's appointment of the NCBiR Director, as well as the selection procedure for the members of the NCBiR Council and ways to determine the term of office of its members.\n\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n\nThe main aim of the draft law is to consolidate the position of the Polish Academy of Sciences as a strong, autonomous scientific institution guided by the constitutional principle of freedom of scientific research by creating mechanisms to counteract current problems in the area of organisation and management, and to adapt the provisions of the law to the changing legal environment.\n\nThe draft law provides for amendments to:\n\n- supervision over the activities of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and its scientific and other organisational units\n\n- organisational structure\n\n- the status of PAN members\n\n- property management\n\n- finances.\n\nMinister of Science and Higher Education with conclusions after visits to 16 academic institutions\n\n26 June 2024\n\nThe Minister of Science and Higher Education summarised the sixteen meetings with the academic community held in all provinces of the country since February. The Minister met with all rectors and also listened to the ideas of thousands of students and doctoral students at open meetings. The conclusions of these visits will be reflected in the planned amendment to the Act Law on Higher Education.\n\nThe minister announced changes to raise the status of doctoral students, increase funding for research and development, and improve the financial situation of students. The amendment to the Act aims to adapt the legislation to contemporary challenges and the needs of the entire academic community.\n\nThe planned changes concern the following areas:\n\nQuality of education\n\nEqual opportunities for studying\n\nConsolidation of universities\n\nIncreased investment in research projects and international cooperation\n\nEvaluation system for academic institutions.\n\nSupporting students to improve their competences and skills\n\n18 June 2024\n\nThe Minister of Science and Higher Education announces a call for candidates for experts for the advisory team in the framework of the implementation of the project entitled \"Supporting students in raising their competences and skills\". Applications can be sent before 2 July 2024.\n\nThe Project assumes systemic support of universities (entities benefiting directly from the support) by enabling female and male students to participate in international competitions, competitions and conferences.\n\nThe aim of the Project is to support female and male students in the development of their:\n\n- competences and skills,\n\n- scientific activity\n\n- innovation\n\n- creativity,\n\nby enabling them to participate in international competitions, competitions, conferences.\n\nThe call for proposals was conducted on the basis of the Call of the Minister of Science and Higher Education and lasted until 24 June 2024. The value of funds allocated for the call for proposals in the current Call is PLN 12,500,000.00. The cost of implementation of one project cannot exceed:\n\n- PLN 80,000.00 - in the case of a project implemented by a single student or a female student;\n\n- PLN 500,000.00 - in the case of a project realised by a team of students.\n\nA total of PLN 27,500,000 is earmarked for the implementation of the project.\n\nOrganising and animating activities for the academic community\n\n6 June 2024\n\nThe competition is aimed at non-governmental organisations and other entities that carry out statutory activities in the academic environment for, among others:\n\n- equalising opportunities for students and doctoral students with disabilities,\n\n- supporting students at an early stage of their studies in order to prevent the phenomenon of abandoning studies (the so-called \"drop out\"),\n\n- student scientific movement and scientific circles,\n\n- raising the legal awareness of students and doctoral students as regards regulations concerning higher education and science - including watchdog activities,\n\n- the development of academic media, with particular emphasis on programmes devoted to studies, research and the popularisation of science,\n\n- popularising pro-environmental behaviour among students and doctoral students.\n\nThis year's thematic scope of the competition was extended to include activities supporting students at an early stage of their studies to prevent the phenomenon of dropping out of university.\n\nThe competition offered funding for initiatives for the academic community in the form of competitions, information campaigns, conferences, seminars, training sessions and workshops. The minimum grant amount was PLN 30 000, and the maximum PLN 120 000.\n\nA record number of 247 offers were submitted for this year's competition. In earlier editions, their number was: 75 (2020), 47 (2021), 54 (2022), 118 (2023). Of all the bids submitted this year, 123 qualified for substantive evaluation. 48 projects will receive funding totalling PLN 4.5 million.\n\nCall for tenders from the Minister of Science under the FERS Programme\n\n10 May 2024\n\nOn 9 May 2024, a call for bids from HEIs was launched as part of the project ‘Supporting students to improve their competences and skills’ funded by the European Funds for Social Development 2021-2027 programme.\n\nThe call is conducted on the basis of the Invitation of the Minister of Science and lasts until 24 June 2024.\n\nThe funds allocated for the call for proposals amount to PLN 12,500,000.00.\n\nThe cost of implementation of one project cannot exceed:\n\n1. 80 000,00 PLN - in the case of a project implemented by a single student;\n\n2. PLN 500,000.00 - in the case of a project implemented by a team of students.\n\nThe aim of the project is to support students in the development of their competences and skills, their research and scientific activity, innovation and creativity by enabling them to participate in international competitions and conferences.\n\nThe outcome of the project will be the acquisition of competences or qualifications by those participating in higher education and an increase in the total number of students who will take part in various forms of competition within the higher education system.\n\nSupport for students in 2024\n\n12 April 2024\n\nAccording to the Budget Act 2024, the funds to be distributed to universities amount to PLN 1.6 billion. In the main subsidy distribution, 1.5 billion has been earmarked. The remaining reserve (PLN 123.5 million) is intended for supplementary and corrective distributions during the year.\n\nThese funds will be used to increase subsidies for, among other things, additional needs of HEIs caused by an increase in the number of students entitled to benefits, and in connection with the change, as of 1 October 2024, of the income criterion entitling a student to a social grant. This threshold will increase from PLN 1,294.4 to PLN 1,570.5 (net) per person in the student's family.\n\nIn the proposed distribution of funds for grants for students and doctoral students in 2024, PLN 1.6 billion is planned. In addition, PLN 230 million will be earmarked for the renovation of dormitories and canteens, as well as over PLN 54 million for expenses related to the granting of the Minister's scholarships for outstanding achievements for students, doctoral students and young scientists. In total, PLN 374 million more was allocated to support students than last year. This is an increase of almost 25 per cent.\n\n\"Universities more accessible\" - NCBR competition\n\n5 April 2024\n\nThe National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) will allocate PLN 400 million to ensure that students with special needs can benefit from the offer of Polish universities. The funds for this purpose come from the European Funds for Social Development programme. Applications for funding can be submitted from 8 April to 28 June.\n\nThis is yet another NCBR competition under the European Funds for Social Development (FERS) programme, which will contribute to the elimination of barriers to access to higher education within the concept of 'Accessible University' .\n\nThe aim of the initiative is to remove barriers to access to higher education. The idea is to implement the principles of equal opportunities by, among other things, providing appropriate infrastructure and organising the educational process in such a way as to ensure that studies are adapted to the needs of all students, especially those with disabilities.\n\nSalary increases for university teachers - regulation signed\n\n21 February 2024\n\nThe Minister of Science and Higher Education has signed a regulation on determining the minimum basic salary of a professor at a public university. It provides for an increase in salaries as of 1 January 2024 by 30 per cent. This means that the salary of a professor will increase from the current level of PLN 7,210 to PLN 9,370. Funds for salary increases for academic teachers in public universities have been secured in the Budget Act for 2024.\n\nThe provisions of the regulation will enter into force on the day following the date of announcement, i.e. 22 February, with effect from 1 January 2024.\n\nThe salaries of academic teachers and research staff of the Polish Academy of Sciences and other benefits in the higher education system are correlated with the minimum salary of a professor.\n\nAccording to the Law on Higher Education and Science, the amount of monthly basic salary in a public university for an academic teacher may not be lower than 50 per cent of the salary of a professor, but for:\n\nuniversity professor - not less than 83 per cent\n\nan assistant professor - not less than 73% of that remuneration.\n\nThe minimum professorial remuneration set out in the regulation also affects a number of other benefits in the higher education and science system, such as the amount of:\n\nthe total monthly amount of social grant and rector's grant that a student may receive,\n\nthe monthly remuneration of the members of the board of a higher education institution,\n\nthe function-related allowance of an employee of a public higher education institution, including the rector,\n\nthe remuneration for promotion proceedings,\n\nmonthly doctoral scholarship.\n\nThe actual level of remuneration in public higher education institutions is shaped independently by the authorities of the institution within the autonomy they have in this respect, individually for each employee and taking into account the financial resources available.\n\nThe amount of the minimum rates of remuneration for academic teachers in particular staff groups after the planned increase will be as follows:\n\nprofessor - PLN 9,370.00 - increase by PLN 2,160.00,\n\nuniversity professor - PLN 7,777.10 - increase by PLN 1,792.80,\n\nassistant professor - PLN 6 840.10 - increase by PLN 1 576.80,\n\nassistant, lecturer - PLN 4,685.00 - increase by PLN 1,080.00.\n\nExpert Panel on the National Internationalisation Strategy of Science\n\n1 February 2024\n\nPreparations for the development of the National Strategy for Internationalisation of Science are underway. Representatives of universities, scientific institutes and other institutions operating in the field of science and higher education have been included in the work on the national strategy. The development of the strategy will take place under the leadership of the National Agency for Academic Exchange and under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.\n\nMembers of the team, which will be the main advisory voice for the preparation of the strategy, received their appointment letters from the Deputy Minister.\n\nAmong the most important factors for increasing the level of internationalisation, experts point to international study programmes, joint research projects and the issue of obtaining funding from the European Union and abroad. The National Science Policy, introduced in 2022, will be an important reference point in the multi-stage and complex process of working on a national internationalisation strategy.\n\n2023\n\nPLN 150 million for the development and renovation of dormitories\n\n28 December 2023\n\n87 universities will receive a total of PLN 150 million for the development and renovation of student dormitories. This is funding that has been allocated in the form of an increase in subvention for 2023. The maximum amount of support for one university is PLN 4 million.\n\nPLN 150 million will go to higher education institutions in the form of increases in subsidies from funding for the maintenance and development of teaching and research potential. Support will be given to higher education institutions offering student dormitories.\n\nSubsidy increases were granted to:\n\n- 85 public higher education institutions supervised by the minister responsible for higher education and science,\n\n- 2 non-public higher education institutions run by the Catholic Church, financed from the state budget under the rules of public higher education institutions.\n\nThe apportionment does not take into account the 14 HEIs that do not manage student dormitories or did not provided data in the approved reports for 2022. The amount has been calculated based on the proportion of places in student accommodation on 31 December 2022.\n\nRecord increase in spending on science and higher education in 2024\n\n20 December 2023\n\nExpenditure on science and higher education will increase by PLN 7 billion. This is an increase of nearly 22 per cent compared to the budget available to Polish science in 2023. The head of the Ministry of Science confirmed a 30 per cent increase for university teachers and a 20 per cent increase for other university staff.\n\nThe Polish Academy of Sciences will also receive additional funds. Its budget will increase by PLN 180 million in 2024. There will also be an increase in funding earmarked for the renovation, refurbishment and construction of dormitories. The Ministry will allocate PLN 150 million for this purpose.\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, it is planned to increase the minimum basic salary of a public university professor by 30 per cent, i.e. from the current level of PLN 7,210 to PLN 9,370. Funds for the increase in the remuneration of academic teachers in public universities have been secured in the Budget bill for 2024.\n\nSalaries of academic teachers and research staff of the Polish Academy of Sciences and other benefits in the higher education system are correlated with the minimum professor's remuneration.\n\nThe minimum professorial salary set out in the regulation also affects a number of other benefits in the higher education and science system, including, among others:\n\nthe total monthly amount of the social grant and the rector's grant that a student may receive,\n\nthe monthly remuneration of the members of the board of a higher education institution,\n\nthe function-related allowance of an employee of a public higher education institution, including the rector,\n\nthe remuneration for promotion proceedings,\n\nthe monthly doctoral scholarship.\n\nNew Minister of Science\n\n18 December 2023\n\nDariusz Wieczorek was appointed Minister of Science in Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government.\n\nOn 1 January 2024, the Ministry of Education and Science will be divided into: Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Science and Higher Education.\n\nThe power of innovation - the new OPI portal now available\n\n12 September 2023\n\nThe Information Processing Centre (OPI) prepared the Innowacje.opi.org.pl portal on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Science. This new address on the Polish Internet contains information on innovative projects which are particularly useful for entrepreneurs and the Polish scientific community. The new portal is not only an extensive database of innovations. Every user will also receive tips on where to find a suitable expert, a report, a scientific publication or even a free online course.\n\nThe Innowacje.opi.org.pl portal contains references to other OPI systems, such as the RAD-on portal, the Polish Scientific Bibliography, Funding Streams Service, NAVOICA or the Medical Research Agency system. Users will find here data on innovative publications and scientific projects, experts in the field, patents, research apparatus and research funding - including free reports and analyses. There is also a wide range of free online courses from the NAVOICA platform on innovation development.\n\nOPI is the main developer and operator of IT systems that collect data on Polish science and higher education. The scope of information in these systems is very broad, which may cause problems with finding specific information. By choosing the address innowacje.opi.org.pl, each user gains access to a large database of innovative activities arranged in a simple and logical manner.\n\nSigning of CEEPUS IV agreement\n\n9 September 2023\n\nDuring the CEEPUS Joint Committee of Ministers in Warsaw, the CEEPUS IV Programme Agreement, to which Poland is a signatory, was signed. The Polish Chairmanship of this Programme came during a period of intensive work and multilateral negotiations between the 15 countries of the region. Their main objective was to develop the text of a new CEEPUS IV agreement, enabling a smooth transition from CEEPUS III to CEEPUS IV in 2025.The CEEPUS IV agreement creates an appropriate legal framework not only for the development of existing regional cooperation within the programme, but also provides new opportunities for countries in the region in terms of academic exchange. Ultimately, the implementation of CEEPUS IV by 2032 will be an important element of cooperation between Central and Southern European countries, positively influencing the improvement of the level and quality of education and research through academic exchange and the development of young researchers.\n\nCEEPUS is one of the main programmes in Poland supporting international mobility. Every year, around 300 Polish students and doctoral students and around 350 academic staff participate in various forms of education and professional qualification improvement under CEEPUS III.
