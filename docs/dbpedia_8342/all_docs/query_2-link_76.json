        "text": "Apart from being home to historical collections and traditional prints the University Library also keeps gaining access to electronic sources of information. It provides a blend of online and zero-contact services, such as: Order a copy, Expert help from libraries Staff or Online Registration, designed to give its users the support and the access they need to scientific resources. Our vast library of electronic resources, including ebooks, ejournals, and databases are available from any location worldwide, thus enabling interaction between users.\n\nGreater Poland Digital Library\n\nIn 2002 the University Library launched one of its first innovative projects called the Greater Poland Digital Library – an IT and search system enabling a fast access to the Library digital collections. The project was initiated by the network of libraries in Poznań to preserve the regional cultural heritage by a long term online storage of resources. The main goal of the project is to offer an easy access to 4 types of resources: educational (manuals, coursebooks, scripts, and scientific monographies), cultural (selected manuscripts and prints of great historical value), regionals ( Poznań and Greater Poland related literature), and musical (notes and literature related to music issues). The Greater Poland Digital Library collections are indexed by the European Digital Library and by Digital Libraries federation gathering resources from all Polish digital libraries. At the Polish national level the University Library in Poznań has been cooperating for 17 years with NUKAT Center in creating the National Universal Central Catalogue. For many years the University library has been in the forefront (top 10) among 170 national libraries considerably contributing to compiling the unique collections.\n\nThe Open Education Coalition\n\nSince 2008 the University Library has been a partner institution of the Open Education Coalition affiliating both non-governmental organizations and educational, cultural and research institutions. Its goal is to build, promote and lobby to the benefit of open scientific and educational resources, understood as wildly available and accessible materials and recordings as well as free distribution and redistribution of derivative works.\n\nAMUR\n\nThe Library enhances access to information, advances scholarly communication, and shares research results using innovative digital platforms. In 2010 the University Library established a pioneer institutional repository called AMUR (Adam Mickiewicz University Repository) enabling the scientific Staff and PhD students to share their publications free of charge through the platform, thus enhancing the visibility and citations of their scientific achievements.\n\nPRESSto\n\nIn 2015 at the University Library PRESSto a platform publishing open journals edited by AMU was commenced. All the articles available through the PRESSto platform are reviewed and accessed online pursuant to the Creative Commons license. The platform aims at increasing the University prestige internationally by enhancing the reviewing journals publishing potential and by an extensive dissemination of its contents.\n\nThe AMU Kowledge Base\n\nSince 2020 the Library has been responsible for the administration and functioning of the Knowledge Base, aiming at improving the University science management, archiving and promoting results of the scientists’ research activity within different disciplines practiced at the University. The AMU Kowledge Base, being part of the Current Research Information system (CRIS), functions within Omega-Psir software."
