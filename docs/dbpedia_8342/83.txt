Over € 240 million for promoting reading in Poland

Under the National Reading Development Programme 2.0, over € 240 milion will be allocated in the years 2021 to 2025 to various forms of support and promotion of reading in Poland. In terms of its financial scale, this represents the largest multiyear programme run by the Ministry of Culture, National Heritage and Sport in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science. Three national cultural institutions are involved in coordinating the Programme – the National Library of Poland, the Book Institute and the National Centre for Culture Poland and the Ministry of Education and Science.

The Programme aims to promote reading in Poland and create the necessary conditions for the development of reading by encouraging pro-reading attitudes and strengthening the role of public, pedagogical and school libraries as centres of local social life and the gateways to culture and knowledge.

The National Library of Poland will be responsible for implementing one of the Programme’s priorities: Improving the offer of public libraries. This involves the purchase of new publications (buying print publications and providing public libraries with remote access to publications in the form of e-books, audiobooks and SynchroBooks). The National Library will also be responsible for building a nationwide network of libraries through the introduction of an integrated library resources management system. This entails implementing and maintaining a single system (Alma and Primo) linking the catalogues of almost 500 different libraries so as to facilitate access to information about the collections held by Polish libraries for users all over the country.
