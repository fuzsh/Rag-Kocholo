        "text": "Russian politician Mikhail Kasyanov has accused President Vladimir Putin of \"silently encouraging\" intimidation as a row over a menacing video continues.\n\nThe video posted by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a strong Putin ally, portrayed Mr Kasyanov though a sniper's gun sights.\n\nMr Kadyrov has criticised social network Instagram for removing it.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, Mr Kasyanov said Mr Putin was responsible for Mr Kadyrov's actions.\n\n\"He is one of the 45 governors of the [Russian] regions, appointed personally by Mr Putin, and Mr Putin is responsible for his behaviour personally,\" he told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford.\n\n\"He is supposed to stop his undertakings... but unfortunately there's no reaction. The fact that Putin who is guarantor of constitution doesn't stop Kadyrov - means it's some kind of silent encouragement at least.\"\n\nPutin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors'\n\nRamzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally\n\nHe and other Russian opposition politicians have described the sniper video, which appeared after the Chechen leader called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\", as a murder threat.\n\n\"They want to intimidate us and continue to create pressure on the opposition,\" Mr Kasyanov said.\n\n\"The main purpose is pressure on the opposition. To make fear. So that we stop our active policy.\"\n\nHe described Mr Kadyrov as \"one of the most outrageous pieces\" of the current Russian political system.\n\n\"Like all people in Russia, we should all be worried about what is going on,\" Mr Kasyanov said.\n\n\"But we've chosen our way and we have to stand up and continue to do our job.\"\n\nThe former prime minister argued that a campaign of intimidation was under way because the Kremlin feared the opposition speaking out about the economic crisis and other issues.\n\n\"That's why they are afraid of us,\" he said. \"Because we will describe who is responsible for the problems of the people.\""
