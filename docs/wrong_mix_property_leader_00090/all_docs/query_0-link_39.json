        "text": "üì£ Deutsche Welle honors Yulia Navalnaya and the Anti-Corruption Foundation with the Freedom of Speech Award. \"The Anti-Corruption and Yulia Navalnaya are dedicated to bringing light into the darkness of the corrupt and murderous system that is the Russian government,\" DW Director General Peter Limbourg said at the ceremony on June 5 at the Humboldt Carr√© in Berlin. Award laureate Yulia Navalnaya emphasized the importance of free speech, stating: \"Freedom of speech is not a weakness, but a strength, Alexei proved this with his entire life and work, (...) showing how the truth makes even an all-powerful dictator tremble with fear.\" She promised to continue the fight, believing that freedom of speech will ultimately triumph over propaganda. Ivan Zhdanov, CEO of the Anti-Corruption Foundation dedicated the award to the \"millions of people who have supported Alexei Navalny and the Anti-Corruption Foundation.\" In his laudatory speech, Germany‚Äôs Federal Minister of Finance Christian Lindner stressed that democracy and the rule of law cannot be taken for granted. Yulia Navalnaya \"reminded us, in the strongest possible terms, that it is the task of us all to fight for freedom and justice in Russia. The Anti-Corruption Foundation has defied all restrictions and has become a powerful symbol of the relentless fight against corruption in Russia.‚Äù Alexei Navalny founded the Anti-Corruption Foundation in 2011. After it was banned by Russian authorities in 2021, the team re-established it as an international organization to continue their work. Since 2015, DW has awarded the Freedom of Speech Award to spotlight the restriction of press freedom worldwide and to honor the exceptional work of journalists and human rights defenders. #Journalism #freedomofspeech\n\nüíôüß°üíú We are super excited to share a link to our brand new ‚ÄòSay it with a Smile‚Äô Charity Website.
