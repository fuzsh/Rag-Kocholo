        "text": "Vladimir Putin has been paraded in front of clapping crowds in Pyongyang during his first visit to North Korea in 24 years.\n\nWhat impact could the Moscow concert hall attack have on Ukraine? We spoke to the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko and asked what the country now expects to happen.\n\nIt’s been a day of mourning in Russia, for the 137 people killed at a rock concert on Friday – the deadliest attack inside the country for two decades. The Islamic State group said they did it and even released a video they say shows the attack. But President Putin and other Russian officials seemed…\n\nMore bodies of those killed in the attack on a Moscow concert hall have been found beneath the rubble of the building. President Putin claims the attackers were trying to flee Russia over the border to Ukraine. At least 133 people were killed and 140 injured after gunmen opened fire at the crowd in the…\n\nWe spoke to the exiled Russian journalist, Mikhail Zygar. I started by asking him if he was surprised that so many people came out to Navalny’s funeral in Moscow given the fact that the Kremlin was warning that they would be breaking the law.\n\nIran counts Russia as a key ally. Iranian drone technology has helped Russia in its war in Ukraine. Both regimes have faced opposition on their streets – and have put them down brutally at times.\n\nIn Brussels, farmers from Belgium and beyond have driven tractors towards EU headquarters, filling the streets with manure, burning tyres and clashing with police.\n\nThere’s a new claim by supporters of the late Russian opposition figure, Alexei Navalny today – they believe he was killed ahead of a planned prisoner swap between Moscow and Western governments.\n\nWe spoke to former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and began by asking for his assessment of how the Russian authorities have acted since the news of Navalny’s death was announced.\n\nThe West has tried to contain President Putin by sanctioning his oil industry – imposing a $60 a barrel price cap on its key export. The UK government says this has cost Russia hundreds of billions of dollars: but how effective has it really been?\n\nWe spoke to the Estonian foreign minister Margus Tsahkna, and started by asking him to what extent the death of Alexei Navalny has intensified the need for international action against Russia.\n\nYulia Navalnaya says she knows exactly why her husband was killed on Friday but while she’s not yet revealing the reason, she places the blame squarely at Vladimir Putin’s feet. In the meantime she’s been addressing European leaders, recording videos and vowing to fight on for what she calls a Free Russia."
