        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin faced heavy attacks both at home and from abroad yesterday as concerns over the imprisonment of tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky continued to mount.\n\nSigns of a full-blown crisis echoed inside the Kremlin walls as Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, the No. 2 power figure in the country, added his voice to those criticizing the handling of Mr. Khodorkovsky's case. The billionaire oilman was arrested at gunpoint last weekend and imprisoned on charges that many observers consider politically motivated.\n\nMr. Kasyanov, who was appointed to his post by Mr. Putin three years ago, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the federal prosecutor-general's move on Thursday to seize more than 40 per cent of the shares of the firm Mr. Khodorkovsky runs, OAO Yukos, the country's largest company.\n\n\"I will refrain from any assessment but my concern is great,\" Mr. Kasyanov said in televised remarks. The Prime Minister also said that he stood by remarks he made in the summer, before Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, that \"it isn't right to arrest someone for economic-related crimes.\"\n\nMr. Kasyanov's remarks followed the resignation of Alexander Voloshin, Mr. Putin's influential chief of staff, and seemed counter to Mr. Putin's admonitions earlier this week that the cabinet should stay out of the matter and let the prosecutor-general's office do its work.\n\nMr. Kasyanov and Mr. Voloshin are both members of a group of pro-business political moderates tied to former president Boris Yeltsin who are seen as losing influence within the Kremlin to a secretive group known as the siloviki; secret-service types who arrived on the coattails of Mr. Putin, himself a former KGB agent.\n\nThe crisis mood around the Kremlin was lightened somewhat by Mr. Putin's decision to appoint Dmitri Medvedev, 38, as his new chief of staff.\n\nMr. Medvedev has a reputation as a clever economist loyal to neither of the two feuding factions.\n\nWhile the appointment of Mr. Medvedev was greeted with relief by Russia's stock markets -- they rose tentatively yesterday after twice plunging earlier in the week -- international criticism continued to rise over the scandal's political dimensions.\n\nMr. Khodorkovsky was funding opposition parties, and Yukos has said it considers the fraud and tax-evasion charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky politically motivated. Its lawyers are now preparing to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn Washington, Pentagon adviser Richard Perle called for Russia to be expelled from the Group of Eight over the affair.\n\n\"No G8 country is allowed to treat its leading businessmen the way Russia treated Khodorkovsky,\" Mr. Perle said. \"I believe Russia is moving fast in the wrong direction.\"\n\nA day earlier, Senator John McCain, one-time U.S. presidential hopeful, said the United States should re-assess its relationship with Russia. \"It is past time for all friends of Russia -- and all who support strong U.S.-Russia relations -- to speak out about the ascendant role of the Russian security services in the Kremlin,\" he said.\n\nSources at Yukos say the company, which was in talks for a deal with U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and ChevronTexaco Corp. before Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, has been exerting all available influence to get the U.S. administration to speak out about the case.\n\nGermany, Russia's largest trading partner, also expressed concern yesterday. Thomas Steg, a spokesman for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, said that \"legal certainty is a central condition for the further integration of Russia into the international economy.\""
