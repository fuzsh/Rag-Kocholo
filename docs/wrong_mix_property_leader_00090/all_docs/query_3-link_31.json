        "text": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been taken to hospital after an antiseptic green dye was splashed on his face in Moscow.\n\nIt is the second time he has been attacked with zelyonka (\"brilliant green\" in English) this year.\n\nThe dye is a common antiseptic in Russia and has been used in protests there and in Ukraine.\n\n\"It looks funny but it hurts like hell,\" Mr Navalny tweeted.\n\nIt is not clear who carried out the attack, which happened near the offices of the Anti-Corruption Fund (FBK) that he founded.\n\nAccording to one report, external (in Russian) he was diagnosed with a chemical burn to the eye.\n\nMr Navalny has been doused with it twice this year. One of Russia's most popular bloggers, Ilya Varlamov, had it thrown at him twice on the same day on 26 April. And pro-Western politician Mikhail Kasyanov had it splashed in his face at a rally commemorating murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov.\n\nSo why brilliant green? It stains the skin and is hard to wash off, which can be a problem if you want to take the media spotlight. Also, it doesn't do any lasting damage, which means attackers will not be facing charges of grave bodily harm.\n\nBut the attackers don't always have the last laugh. When Mr Navalny was last doused he turned his green face into an internet meme and was imitated by his supporters."
