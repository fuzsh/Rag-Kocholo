        "text": "Opposition leader Mikhail Kasyanov said a group of men burst into a Moscow restaurant where he was dining on Tuesday night and threatened him, days after an ally of Vladimir Putin issued a video showing him in the cross-hairs of a sniper's rifle.\n\nKasyanov, who filed a police complaint saying his life and safety had been threatened, is a fierce critic of Putin. Kasyanov's liberal opposition Parnas party is planning to contest parliamentary elections later this year.\n\n\"In a restaurant in the centre of Moscow about 10 unidentified men of a non-Slavish appearance threw a cake at me and shouted threats at me after which they got away in their cars,\" Kasyanov said in a statement.\n\nMikhail Kasyanov told the Russian news agency Interfax that about 10 men of \"non-Slavic appearance\" entered a Moscow restaurant where he was dining Tuesday night and slammed a cake in his face. Kasyanov, who is chairman of the opposition \"PARNAS\" party, said the men also shouted insults.\n\nOther threats recently made to Kasyanov cast the event in a darker light.\n\nEarlier this year, Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechnya republic, called Russian opposition figures \"enemies of the people\" and later posted a video on Instagram that shows Kasyanov in the bull's eye of a rifle.\n\nLast Update: Feb 10, 2016 10:53 am\n\nKEYWORDS"
