Homotopia: A utopia for homosexuals. A place where queer people go to socialise, work, eat, shop, learn, pray, dance or date where they feel they can be completely themselves.

Coming out is never easy. And many of us have heard stories about the hard emotional work queer people must do to become publicly gay.

But what about the story of how parents, grandparents, siblings and extended families work out how to come out- not just as people who tolerate and accept their gay children- but who truly support and celebrate them?

Part one of Homotopia told the story of the places gay people go to create new families for themselves, often after being rejected by their biological ones. But now that we are living in a world that’s more gay friendly than ever before, is it possible for LGBTI folk to build homotopias, not away from their biological families, but with them?

In part two, producer Bec Zajac tells the story of her family’s rainbow transformation, speaks with the woman who was instrumental in the Victorian Country Women’s Association’s recent campaign to support same sex marriage, and introduces us to Luke, who grew up in the foster care system, and faced a particularly unique challenge when it came to talking about his identity with his foster family.
