        "text": "After an eight-year ban, LGBTQ+ couples returned to Polish national TV on January 6. Among them was famous gay couple Jakub and Dawid. Jakub was fired from Telewizja Polska seven years ago because he was gay. Now waving a rainbow flag on air, he had a pleasure to announce: “Homophobia is over on Polish TV”.\n\nThe last eight years have been difficult for the LGBTQ+ community in Poland. The conservative government enacted a number of regulations discriminating against sexual minorities – among them infamous LGBTQ-free zones. LGBTQ+ topics were also banned in national media. There were attempts to erase the rainbow flag even during the broadcast of Eurovision. Jacob lost his job after getting married to his husband seven years ago.\n\nIn December, after winning the elections, the democratic coalition took power and announced changes for the LGBTQ+ community. Prime Minister Donald Tusk decided to issue the Act on Civil Partnerships within the first 100 days after coming to power. National Television has also changed. The visit of LGBTQ+ couples with rainbow flags was symbolic as a new chapter for national television. Jacob is also expecting to become the host of a morning show on Polish TV.\n\nBrighton & Hove residents are invited to share their experiences with Brighton & Hove Libraries in an interactive installation at Jubilee Library, Brighton from Monday, January 15 to Sunday, January 28.\n\nFrom free books to study spaces to a great spot for catching up with friends, the library means different things for different people. The libraries are now curious to find out what they mean for you, to help them inspire a new generation of library users.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to contribute to a collective wall digitally with a tablet, where you can select a sticker and type in a message which will then appear on a screen. Or you can also share your thoughts via a traditional sticky note on the wall.\n\nThe installation is a part of the Community Connect project, which aims to attract new audiences to join the library community and remind everyone of the abundance of services the libraries provide, which go far beyond books.\n\nCouncillor Leslie Pumm, chair of the Equalities, Community Safety & Human Rights Committee, said: “I invite everyone to join in and leave their mark on the lovely new installation in the Jubilee Library.\n\n“It’s a wonderful way to provide feedback and share what the library means for you, but also to immerse yourself in experiences of others, get inspired and learn about what else the library has to offer.\n\n“Our library staff works very hard to provide a space that is safe and welcoming to everyone, but also serves as a vibrant beating heart of our communities.\n\n“New parents, budding business owners, newcomers to the city or anyone looking for a bit of joy, connection or creative outlets can find free and low-cost activities and resources here, meet up, get support and grow as their best selves.\n\n“We want more people to know about these opportunities, especially young people and those who may not have considered using our libraries before.”\n\nBrighton & Hove Libraries has been working with local design studio, Boyle & Perks, on the Community Connect project to encourage a new generation of library users and shape their future services for our diverse community.\n\nThe project aims to engage with young people between the ages of 12 and 19 and people who are interested in arts and culture who have not previously interacted with our libraries.\n\nIt uses feedback from over 300 people, collected through surveys and workshops with users, residents, and the local MET College.\n\nThe funding for the project is provided through the LibraryOn grant, developed by the British Library and funded by Arts Council England to connect libraries and people and celebrate libraries as cornerstones of local communities.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Education Minister Gabriel Attal as France’s first openly gay Prime Minister.\n\nAttal lives in a civil union with Stéphane Séjourné, a member of the European Parliament for La République En Marche. During his political career, Attal received antisemitic and homophobic hate speech on social media, which he once called “bucketloads of vomit” from internet trolls concerning his identity.\n\nOpinion polls show President Macron’s party trailing Far Right leader Marine Le Pen by around eight to ten percentage points. Gabriel Attal, who at 34 is also the country’s youngest Prime, will be tasked with trying to improve Mr Macron’s chances in the June EU elections.\n\nMr Attal, a close Macron ally, became a household name after being appointed government spokesman during the Covid pandemic.\n\nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, President Macron said: “Dear Gabriel Attal, I know I can count on your energy and your commitment to implement the rearmament and regeneration project that I announced. In fidelity to the spirit of 2017: surpassing and audacity. In the service of the Nation and the French.”\n\nThe Brighton & Hove Labour administration has given the go ahead for major transport and public realm project, Valley Gardens Phase 3.\n\nPhase 3 will complete the Valley Gardens project which will provide a new sustainable transport corridor for the city, together with a transformed city centre public space, from the Old Steine to the seafront.\n\nThe initial scheme design was approved in 2018. Since then, the preferred design option has been through modelling, and engagement through public consultation exercises, and stakeholder design workshops.\n\nThe plans for phase 3 include:\n\nImproved access for public transport, supporting more reliable journey times\n\nAn additional taxi rank near the Palace Pier junction as well as retaining two existing ranks\n\nNew obstruction-free (where possible) pavement design\n\nNew trees and landscaping\n\nSustainable outdoor event infrastructure\n\nNew separated cycle lanes, linking phases 1 & 2 of Valley Gardens to the seafront\n\nImproved lighting around Old Steine Gardens\n\nIncrease in parking bays for Blue Badge holders\n\nA new junction to replace the existing Palace Pier roundabout, including direct crossing points for pedestrians and cyclists and enhanced signalling to ensure the flow of traffic including buses.\n\nEnhanced bus stop design for safety of waiting passengers and effective passenger pick up.\n\nImproved setting around the War Memorial.\n\nCouncillor Trevor Muten, Chair of the Transport and Sustainability Committee, said: “We are delighted to be able to now press ahead with Phase 3 of the Valley Gardens scheme.\n\n“We have always been committed to delivering the final phase of the Valley Gardens improvements but had a responsibility to forensically check the details in view of the amount of money that is being invested in the last phase of this important project.\n\n“Given some of the ill-thought out transport schemes under the last Green administration, including the proposed Low Traffic Neighbourhood, we decided to review all transport schemes and are now satisfied that the Phase 3 design is the best possible for the city.\n\n“It was a Labour-led administration that approved the initial design in 2018 and that secured funding for the project.\n\n“We now have a final design which will enhance safer active travel, provide an improved transport system, and a fantastic public amenity in the heart of the city for residents and visitors. I am proud that it will be this Labour administration that delivers it.”\n\nLead Pic: Kate Hockenhull Photography\n\nVAULT – the creators of VAULT Festival, an independent festival of live performance for underrepresented artists – has announced that tickets for their first fundraising gala are now on sale. VAULT Gala: Light at the End of the Tunnel, will take place on Tuesday, March 19 in the Assembly Hall of the iconic Shoreditch Town Hall to raise funds towards the opening of VAULT’s new cutting edge central London venue which is due to open later this year.\n\nThe Gala will see an evening full of glamour, decadence and entertainment, held one year to the day since VAULT closed the doors of VAULT Festival for the final time in their original home, sparking the search for a new home to secure their future. With a new venue now secured, the gala will not only raise funds for VAULT’s new location, but also celebrate resilience, hope, a fervent commitment to the arts as the organisation enters into a new era, highlighting the challenges to the survival of arts venues over the last few years. Attendees can expect:\n\nA drink reception followed by a three course meal of seasonal and sustainable dishes from forward thinking East London catering company Juniper & Co accompanied by bubbles, wine, cocktails and artisanal beers from drinks partner Lost and Grounded Brewers.\n\nAn auction hosted by a soon to be revealed leading performer where guests can bid on exclusive experiences and memorabilia\n\nPerformances from top comedians, cabaret and drag artists representing the spirit and vibrancy of VAULT.\n\nTo cover the costs of the new venue, VAULT is raising money through a range of means including repayable social investment, grants from trusts and foundations, as well as public giving initiatives. In 2023, VAULT raised £62,572 including £22,914 in just one week through the Big Give Christmas Challenge to fund captioning, hearing loop and audio description equipment to help make their new venue accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nVAULT Gala is their latest fundraising initiative aiming to fundraise £40,000 to support the fit out cost of their new home, including structural works and production and technical infrastructure. Additionally, VAULT will be launching the #BuildVAULT public donations drive in February, aiming to raise £12,000 to go towards venue infrastructure, giving people the opportunity to sponsor different elements of the new venue, from individual toilets to entire spaces.\n\n2024 is an exciting year for VAULT with the launch of their brand new venue and the triumphant return of their flagship event VAULT Festival this autumn. VAULT’s festival of live work-in-progress shows, A Pinch of VAULT, is also returning for a third year showcasing new works from leading independent performance makers taking place at The Glitch and venues across Waterloo and Bankside from February 12 – March 10.

There has been a two-year hiatus in meetings with Britain’s leading LGBTQ+ group, Stonewall. The Minister should at least listen to a range of viewpoints. The safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ citizens should be the Minister’s goal,” added Mr Tatchell.\n\nThe foundation’s letter to Kemi Badenoch, signed by Peter Tatchell, states: “There is a majority consensus among LGBTQ+ people that the Government needs to do more to support trans people, tackle homophobic hate crimes and ban LGBTQ+ conversion practices.\n\n“Regrettably, reported instances of homophobic and transphobic hate crime are on the rise, propelled by often inflammatory, divisive and intolerant rhetoric.\n\n“Under successive Conservative governments, the UK’s ranking in the European LGBTQ+ rights league table has fallen from first to 17th place. This is very disturbing and merits urgent rectification. A similar decline in health or education would rightfully be deemed a national disgrace.\n\n“By listening to the perspectives of a range of LGBTQ+ organisations, it will, I hope, help inform you and your policy making, as well as shape your input to the Conservative manifesto for the upcoming general election,” the invitation letter notes.\n\nREAD the invitation letter to Kemi Badenoch here\n\nMeet Brighton & Hove City Council‘s Shared Lives team at Jubilee Library on Thursday, January 11 and find out how you could use your spare room to support someone by providing regular short breaks or full-time home\n\nShared Lives carers provide support for people with learning disabilities, mental health needs, or other support needs. They can support them lead fulfilling lives by providing them with regular short breaks or a full-time home. Carers are paid a weekly fee with significant tax benefits.\n\nEbby moved in with Jackie and Jim under the Shared Lives scheme in 2015. Jackie explained: “It’s so rewarding to be able to open my home and make a difference. Ebby and I know each other well, and I can support her in doing the things she likes. I’ve really seen her develop her skills over the years.\n\n“We make plans together and do fun things like going out for meals, trips out, and holidays, as well as the everyday tasks to support Ebby, joining in with things around the house and doing as much for herself as possible.\n\n“I think it would be great if more people came forward to give people the chance to live this way.”\n\nCouncillor Tristram Burden, Lead member for Adult Services said: “Shared Lives carers provide fantastic care, but we are always looking for more people to support those who need it.\n\n“We’re looking for people from across Brighton & Hove with the time and space to consider opening their homes to someone who needs support and help them to live more independently in their communities.\n\n“If you think you might be suitable, please contact our Shared Lives team to learn more.”\n\nFor more information, email info.sharedlives@brighton-hove.gov.uk, call 01273 295550 or visit the Shared lives website.\n\nYou can find out about becoming a Shared Lives carer and meet the Shared Lives team at the drop-in session at Jubilee Library from 10am to 4pm on Thursday, January 11.\n\nLead Pic: Dr Jane Padmore, CEO of Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust and Neil Blanchard, Chair of Southdown\n\nSussex Partnership has joined forces with voluntary sector organisations to enhance the support available for people with mental health problems, learning disabilities and neurodiversity.\n\nSeven organisations representing the voluntary community and social enterprise sector (VCSE) and Sussex Partnership have signed the Sussex Compact, an agreement which sets out a vision for working in partnership to shape and deliver non-clinical services.\n\nThrough adopting new ways of working, it will help all the organisations meet the needs of the community with improved support and services.\n\nDr Jane Padmore, Chief Executive of SPFT, said: “I am delighted to sign up to this compact. It is a bold commitment about how we are working differently and is an example of how we are committed to working in partnership to improve the lives and services for people with mental health problems, learning disabilities and the neurodiverse.”\n\nNeil Blanchard, Chair of the Sussex VCSE Alliance and Chief Executive of Southdown, which provides specialist care, support and housing in Sussex, added: “Sussex not-for-profit organisations and charities are at the forefront and frontline responding to local communities’ needs; holding trusted relationships to provide access to advice, guidance and support.\n\n“With increasing pressure and demand on services, we are committed to being true strategic partners with the Sussex Partnership where our skills, experience and local knowledge can be fully utilised and respected to help design new solutions. To make this a reality requires new ways of working. The Sussex Compact, cowritten with the Sussex Partnership, acts as a great starting point.”\n\nThe VCSE sector has long provided a range of support to the NHS, including delivering services and being partners in strategy development. There are 257 voluntary organisations and charities working in Brighton & Hove, East Sussex and West Sussex delivering mental health and wellbeing support and 45 specific mental health organisations. They range from small grassroots organisations to larger organisations.\n\nThe Clock Tower Sanctuary (CTS), a charity that supports young people experiencing homelessness in Brighton & Hove, has welcomed new CEO Fabia Bates.\n\nFabia Bates, who replaces Frances Duncan who leaves CTS following six and a half years as CEO, brings over 20 years of experience in Brighton’s community and voluntary sector including at Survivors’ Network and Community Works. She also has experience as both trustee and chair at two local charities – the Trust for Developing Communities, which supports communities facing poverty and exclusion, and Hummingbird Project, which supports young refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nFabia Bates said: “I’m delighted to be joining the wonderful team at CTS. I’ve lived in Brighton for nearly 25 years and am acutely aware of the impact of their work, and how vital it has become in recent years. I’m looking forward to working with the staff, volunteers, partners and of course the young people, to continue to ensure a safe, supportive and positive space for the young homeless community in the city.”\n\nFabia’s appointment follows the publication of the charity’s 2023 Impact Report, which saw their demand for services increase year on year. More clients were sleeping rough in the final quarter of 2023 than ever before, up from 9% to 25%, with more than 2,500 individual visits made to the charity’s day centre by 133 individual young people last year.\n\nFundraising remains crucial to deliver these services as the charity receives no statutory funding. Despite it being one of the most challenging years for fundraising, CTS was able to generate over £48,000 from its 2023 Christmas Appeal, which will fund the drop-in service for two months.\n\nFrances Duncan, who is leaving CTS as CEO to work on new projects, said: “We couldn’t help any of our homeless young clients without the incredible support of everyone who donates, supports, volunteers and helps us raise these crucial funds – so thank you to everyone who supported us in 2023.”\n\nFrances added: “This has been the best job and I’m absolutely delighted that I can handover to Fabia Bates who is taking over as CEO. She’s incredible and brings many talents including a strategic outlook, strong partnership capabilities, relevant networks, and an ability to get things done. All are essential as the charity strives to make homelessness for young people a rare, brief and non-recurring event.”\n\nAlex Rees, chair of trustees, added: “I’m so pleased that Fabia Bates is joining as the new CEO at CTS – she has incredible experience of dealing with issues that this city faces and she’s the perfect person to help us deal with the many challenges that we face to ensure we continue delivering the support that our young people need.”"
