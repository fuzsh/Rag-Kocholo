In the 1920s, the term \"lavender boy\" was used to describe gay men who were accused of not being masculine enough. Even Abraham Lincoln was once referred to as \"lavender\" by a historian. Lavender became associated with lesbians who wanted to be included in the women's movement. In 1970, activists disrupted a women's event wearing T-shirts that read \"Lavender Menace\" to fight against discrimination. The crowd welcomed them into the fold, and in 1971, lesbian rights became a \"legitimate concern of feminism.\" As a business, it's important to understand the cultural importance of LGBTQIA+ history. By recognising and celebrating the resilience and strength of our community's history, we can create a more inclusive workplace and foster a sense of belonging for all employees. Let's continue to learn from our past and work towards a more equitable future for everyone. #LGBTQ+ #inclusion #diversity #belonging #community #history"
