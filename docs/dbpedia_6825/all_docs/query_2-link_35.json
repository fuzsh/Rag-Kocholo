        "text": "The study presented is a comparative investigation into multimodal discourses (O’Halloran, Tan, Smith & Podlasov, 2011) of same-sex relationships and desire in The Simpsons and Steven Universe. Analysis is applied to 15 key episodes in order to examine the way in which same-sex, or non-heterosexual romantic desire and relationships are presented in an aging and more recent animated TV show, commonly viewed by both adults as well as children; this is done in order to examine the ways in which homosexuality is routinely presented in each. Analysis adopts a Foucauldian interpretive approach to language (Arribas-Ayllon & Walkerdine, 2008) alongside other multimodal aspects of discourse (e.g. imagery; sound) in order to analyse constructions and representations of gay relationships and desire and how they are situated within the shows. Findings suggest that while The Simpsons adheres to the standard reproduction of prejudicial, stereotyped and marginalising discourses, Steven Universe takes a more unique and emotionally orientated approached to the constructions of discourses involving same-sex relationships and desire and that the progression of gay visibility in cartoons is only now extending beyond fleeting, two-dimensional stereotypes towards more intimate and romanticised discourses of same-sex relationships and desire.\n\nFrom its creation The Simpsons proved different, but how the irreverence of a show can be enough for the American public to select this sitcom as it preferred primetime watching time? How the show confronts capital issues of our decadent society as race, gender, religion sex and first, family and marriage. It’s not all in the humor or the quality of color or maybe selecting aggressive topics like the environment of corruption. How the gender representation in topics like homosexuality in majority of male characters on the show affect the way the audience react to them. Multiple recog-nitions around the world, but also critics about their political agenda and controversy. This show create a momentum for success on television for shows oriented to social aspect and adult anima-tion, awakening also a wave of copycats around the world. The success of the sitcom resides in big part in how the show presents actual social topics that make them attractive for all. Now society is moving on, moral decay is all around and a family show, with a very dysfunctional family, agree, it’s getting behind. Are we seeing the last of them or the team have more surprises under their hat? Will see. That’s the reason of the few ideas put together in this paper.\n\nPresented at the Midwest PCA/ACA conference in October 2017, and also published in a longer form in the Fall 2017 issue of Red Feather Journal. Children’s animation remains a highly contested space, under great scrutiny due to its presumed importance in forming the identities of children. As a result, queerness (in all its forms) has long been relegated to mere connotation through subtext. More recently, however, a shift has been made with series such as The Legend of Korra and Steven Universe, which are more explicit in their denotative expressions of queer identity. What role does oppositional queer reading, primarily as understood by Alex Doty, play in this evolution? This paper argues that nonheterocentrist interpretations of children’s animation has destabilized our understanding of media intended for children, and that this alteration may be due in some part to the ability of fandoms to influence the creators of this media.\n\nABSTRACT This article studies the representation of queer characters and themes in the contemporary adult animated sitcom. We argue that even though popular culture is often assumed to reiterate and consolidate the discourse of heteronormativity, adult animated sitcoms create space for queer resistance. Since the genre draws on postmodern strategies of representation, we argue that queer resistance is subversively articulated through instances of pastiche and parody. It is embedded in content that is both complicit with and critical of the heteronormal. Through a textual thematic analysis of Family Guy, this case study illustrates how postmodern textual strategies create deconstructionist instances that expose and subvert the hegemony of heteronormativity."
