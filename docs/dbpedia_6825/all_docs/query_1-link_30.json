Instead of releasing people, they are squeezing over 1,000 women and transgender people into the two remaining women’s prisons. This has aggravated overcrowding (bringing Central California Women’s Facility’s population dangerously close to 4000), created dangerous conditions and health care is getting much worse. What’s more, they have added yet another men’s prison to their inhumane system.\n\nCOME SHOW SUPPORT FOR ALL PEOPLE LOCKED UP IN CHOWCHILLA’S PRISONS!\n\nTELL THE FEDERAL JUDGES OVERCROWDING MUST STOP NOW!\n\nBRING OUR LOVED ONES HOME!\n\nRides available by bus and carpool.
