I am transsexual, meaning that despite I have XY-genome, psychologically I am a woman,\" she added.\n\nThe Family Code of Russia claims that marriage is \"a voluntary consent of a man and a woman\" but Irina and Alyona consider themselves to be the first LGBT married couple in the country.\n\nIrina is on hormone therapy, wears her blonde hair long and likes feminine clothes and make-up and, despite living her life as a woman, the couple have been able to register their marriage without violating laws due to the biological discrepency.\n\nHowever, the event has angered St Petersburg MP Vitaly Milonov, who is a vocal opponent of same-sex marriages and vowed to investigate the legality of their union.\n\n\"I understood their [registry office workers'] unconvincing arguments; they formally approached the issue and saw passports, but not people. I told the head [of the wedding registry office] that it is criminal negligence,\" he told local media, according to Russia Today.\n\nMilonov said he is going to get prosecutors involved to try to avoid such \"ugly insults to millions of Russian families in the future.\"\n\nRainbow List 2014\n\nShow all 101\n\nThe marriage is considered to be a monumental step toward getting same-sex marriages legalised in Russia, and one of the bridesmaids, Marina Teodori, is reported to have said: \"This is a big step for all of us. Most of us want formally get married, but in Russia it is still impossible.\n\n\"For us it is the realisation of our dreams. We hope many will have this opportunity.\"\n\nHowever, not all LGBT-activists agree that Irina and Alyona should be considered a gay couple as they argue that their union is not between two biological males or females.\n\nGay rights campaigner Nikolay Alekseev told Russia Today: \"This is in no way a same-sex marriage. This is a question of transgender, not homosexuality.\"\n\n\"This is an old story, there had been such cases before. A certain gender is written in a passport, but how they dress for the wedding is their business,\" he added.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
