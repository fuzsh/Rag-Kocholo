May 17 was chosen to commemorate the World Health Organization's decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder, in 1990. It is currently celebrated in more than 130 countries, including 37 where same-sex acts are illegal. This year's theme is \"No One Left Behind: Equality, Freedom and Justice for All\". The world has just celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – a document that is much more than a cornerstone of international law: It is a guide to navigate the deeply divided world, a set of values that everyone can live by and ultimately a force of good. And yet, we know that \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\" represents a promise not yet fulfilled – for 2SLGBTQ2+ people across the world and for everyone experiencing the suffocating impact on their lives of diverse layers of inequalities. This year's IDAHBT theme is a call for unity: Only through solidarity for each other will we create a world without injustice, where no one is left behind.” ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍🩷🩵 #InternationalDayAgainstHomophobiaAndTransphobia #ForeverProud #ForeverProgressing #2SLGBTQ #Equality #Freedom #Justice #IDAHBT\n\nKey facts: 62 countries have laws that criminalize private, consensual, same-sex sexual activity, mainly for men. Almost half of them are Commonwealth jurisdictions. 12 of them have jurisdictions in which the death penalty is imposed or at least a possibility for private, consensual same-sex sexual activity. At least 6 of these implement the death penalty. 14 countries criminalize the gender identity and expression of transgender people. In many more countries, transgender people are targeted by a range of laws that criminalize same-sex activity and vagrancy, hooliganism, and public order offenses. It is important to note that legality of same-sex sexual acts cannot be read as evidence of a safer living environment for people with diverse sexual orientations or gender identities or expressions. In many of the States where consensual same-sex sexual acts are legal, the social stigmatization of people who are perceived as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender remains alarmingly high.

The two main political parties right now are using trans rights as political pawns ♟️(this comes as no surprise to the community). However specifically the Tories, if kept in power, can create so much damage by changing the Equality Act and protections against the trans community, including the legal definition of biological sex and access to single sex spaces 🤯 Doing so will make it nearly impossible for trans people to exist safely in society 😭 The problem here is this uneducated fear mongering & hate speech (from both sides) will speak to uneducated voters looking for an enemy and there is a genuine possibility they can stay in power 😩 Trans people are NOT the enemy, but instead an extremely vulnerable part of society that make up less than 1% of the population 🌍 We are not up for discussion. Our lives matter and we are human beings just trying to get on with our sh*t. It genuinely makes me sick to my stomach that I pay takes and contribute to an economy in a country run by politicians that argue the validity of my existence & are trying to take away my rights 🔗 So educate yourselves, your loved ones and your colleagues that trans people just want to be loved and trans kids deserve to grow up 🏳️⚧️ And sign up here to get rid of the tories, with free stragic voting advice in your area : https://lnkd.in/dNnbbqbP ⚡️ Thea xoxo #translivesmatter #transisbeautiful #lgbtq #pridemonth #toriesout\n\nNo one left behind: equality, freedom and justice for all! Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT). With equality, freedom and justice in mind, we want to bring attention to the recently announced review of Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) in the UK. Following years of targeted anti-trans sentiment, the proposed RSHE guidance states simply that \"gender identity should not be taught\". Pushing trans and nonbinary people from the public eye doesn't change the reality that we exist. Children should not be brought up with a narrow and unrealistic understanding of human diversity, leaving them woefully unprepared for a naturally diverse world. Simply not teaching about gender will not prevent kids from being trans and non-binary, but it will teach those kids to live in enforced silence and shame. We are still feeling the repercussions of Section 28. A repeat of that injustice is being threatened again, now. The gov review of the RSHE statutory guidance consultation is open now and closes 11:59pm on 11 July 2024. Please fill it out - let's oppose the utter inadequacy of this proposed guidance, together (link in our bio). Not one child or young person should be left behind. Equality, freedom, and justice for ALL! #Proud2Be #Trans #Nonbinary #Gay #Bi #IDAHOBIT #IDAHOBIT2024 #LGBT #LGBTQ #LGBTQIA\n\nYour beliefs shouldn't take away from the freedom of others. \"Seriously, is freedom the core principle of everything in this country? Yes or no? You know what that means? That means your personal beliefs do not get to take away other people's freedoms. If you're sitting in this room right now, and you're somebody who thinks I don't, there are people who do this, who thinks I don't think LGBT, any of the letters should exist. Everybody should be heterosexual. How many agree there are people in this country who believe that yes or no? Okay. That's, Hey, you could choose to believe that. That's very different than saying you all have to believe it because I do. Okay. That's not freedom anymore. How many of these are a huge difference when you start sitting in this room thinking, because of what I've been taught, what I believe, everybody must believe this, if you agree with me, that's dangerous to just say dangerous.\" 👉 Learn more at https://lnkd.in/gntE7Q4Q #CenterForRespect #MikeDomitrz #Culture #Respect\n\nEvery day that the Commonwealth Government fails to introduce its long-promised reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act is another day that an LGBTQ student at a religious school wakes up scared to go to school because they can be legally mistreated because of who they are. And another day that an LGBTQ teacher fears losing their job for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with whether they can actually perform their job. This situation is unacceptable, as is the fact the road to change continues to drag on. We must continue to keep the pressure up on the Albanese Government until they are finally forced to take action. Part of sustaining that pressure is conveying our message, about the urgent need for reform, to new audiences. In that context, a couple of weeks ago I sat down for an extended interview with ex-ABC journalist Josh Szeps, for his podcast ‘Uncomfortable Conversations’, which has now been published. An edited version of that chat can be listened to via Spotify: https://lnkd.in/gnkh-VF7 And found at Apple: https://lnkd.in/gwnQFdKS Or on YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gJvhTvse I understand the full hour-long conversation is available to his paid subscribers, too. Anyway, it was an interesting conversation, and I think/hope I managed to articulate the case for change convincingly. Let me know your thoughts, either way, in the comments. #auslaw #auspol #lgbtiq #sexdiscriminationact #nswpol #antidiscriminationact #religiousfreedom #humanrights\n\nIt was created in 2004 to draw the attention of policymakers, opinion leaders, social movements, the public and the media to the violence and discrimination experienced by LGBTQ+ people internationally. In under a decade, May 17 has established itself the single most important date for communities to mobilize on a worldwide scale. The Day represents an annual landmark to draw the attention of decision makers, the media, the public, opinion leaders and local authorities to the alarming situation faced by lesbian, gay, bisexuals, transgender and intersex people and all those who do not conform to majority sexual and gender norms. May 17 is now celebrated in more than 130 countries, including 37 where same-sex acts are illegal, with 1600 events reported from 1280 organizations in 2014. These mobilization unite millions of people in support of the recognition of human rights for all, irrespective of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. The International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is not one centralized campaign; rather it is a moment that everyone can take advantage of to take action. The date of May 17th was specifically chosen to commemorate the World Health Organization’s decision in 1990 to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder. The International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia has received official recognition from several States, international institutions as the European Parliament, and by countless local authorities. Most United Nations agencies also mark the Day with specific events. #ablgbt #ab #yyc #yeg #alberta #ablgbtchamber #businessAB #supportlocal #albertabusiness #supportlocalalberta\n\nI can’t imagine how distressing it must be to be Trans in this current climate. Just imagine being painted as sexual predators, misguided children and sports cheats by turns. Never mind that these narratives contradict, aren’t supported by evidence and are being being used in the same way propaganda has always been used. Time for some basic empathy and time for a history lesson. Remember when it was your sexuality that made you the ‘bogeyman’ or the colour of your skin. Remember when women weren’t allowed to think for themselves or anyone that didn’t own property. This is why we say we have to learn the lessons of history of be doomed to repeat the same mistakes. Here we go repeating those same mistakes again. This time we are ‘othering’ Trans people. Next time it could be you!"
