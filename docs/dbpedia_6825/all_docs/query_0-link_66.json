        "text": "It is often said that gay scenes of towns and cities outside London suffer from provincial conservatism. From my own experience, I think it is true that in those environments people tend to get fed up quickly, as their lives and relationships become increasingly repetitive and incestuous.\n\nLast October, I moved from Glasgow to Liverpool – two cities with many similarities. Both are historically working-class seaports and both have held the title European Capital of Culture.\n\nYet, as I moved into what I came to discover was the gay quarter of Liverpool, I was surprised by the sheer differences between the two cities and their gay scenes.\n\nOn my first Saturday night out in Liverpool, I made my way with some fellow Glaswegians to the renowned queer hotspot, Garlands. But despite, the overabundance of camp Judy Garland imagery in the place, I found the club teeming with macho men.\n\nThe comparisons with Village People end there, however. As we pranced around awkwardly for two hours, I couldn't help but notice the lack of same-sex affection that one usually comes to expect in gay clubs. Indeed, by the end of the night, one of the male friends who had accompanied me was being aggressively spoken to for flirting with what turned out to be a heterosexual man.\n\nIn the weeks following this, I was woken by the news that a trainee police officer called James Parkes, at just 22 years of age, was beaten up around the corner from my home, in a violent homophobic attack which left him fighting for his life.\n\nThere were also rumours that the Pink nightclub, in the same district, was to be closed temporarily following a series of alleged incidents (which the club denied).\n\nNow of course similar things happen in London but in a smaller city, when several happen in quick succession one can't help but feel a little anxious and confused.\n\nAfter speaking to the owners and promoters of gay venues, I started to get to the root of why Liverpool was different. The first issue was an economic one. Quickly it became apparent that business-minded owners were unwilling to restrict their door policies, arguing that their entrance rules shouldn't be exclusive to the gay community. Considering the multiplicity of gay venues that all play cheesy music and sell cheap booze, it would make little economic sense for them to limit their clientele when there is such direct competition. But when I begged for a right to feel safe in a nightclub, one gay venue owner argued back that this would be tantamount to \"ghettoising\" the queer community from the rest of society.\n\nSurely this makes little sense. If gay venue owners are worried about maintaining business, there should be fewer venues, and these very sites should hold more diverse events, while encouraging an open-minded atmosphere.\n\nFor comparison, Glasgow – a larger city than Liverpool – has a similar number of LGBT venues. And although these have their own tiresome pitfalls, the difference is that physical expressions of affection between gay couples are rarely something that Glasgow clubbers need to worry about. Even in the slightly rougher queer places in Glasgow, such as the bear-friendly Revolver Bar, and Bennett's, the expression of physical warmth between same-sex couples is protected by the managers, who operate a tolerant door policy.\n\nBut the complexities of Liverpool don't end there. Equally thorny, is the expectation that all Liverpudlians are, to put it crudely, \"scallies\". This idea that men in Liverpool need to exude a tough exterior is perplexing, as this notion of the \"scally\" is often associated with violence, and aggression.\n\nIs there perhaps a problem reconciling this persona with that of the open-minded queer community? Do angsty teenagers feel threatened by the notion that gay men can be just as tough as they are, and as such seek to stake their claim by consciously choosing to hang out in, and attack their queer hub?\n\nThere are plans for the local council and businesses to turn Liverpool's gay district into a pedestrian-friendly quarter, in the hope of instigating a safe cafe culture akin to that of Canal Street in neighbouring Manchester. In my opinion, this kind of forced regeneration is futile. Liverpool is a smaller city that needs to develop its own niche, without continuing to live in the shadow of its nearby rival.\n\nCertainly, there need to be a different means for members of the gay community in Liverpool to have dialogue with each other. At a time when police cars are frequently patrolling the gay quarter, there should be less intimidating forums for LGBT individuals to find their sense of community. An example of this was evidenced in the wake of the attack on James Parkes, when the Homotopia queer arts festival gained an increasingly prominent political role, inviting police officers and councillors to speak at their launch, in turn encouraging debate. Elsewhere, a few independent promoters have launched alternative club nights such as Chew Disco, with some success.\n\nIf this desire for change continues to ripple across the city, then we may find a far more organic gay movement forming – one that takes into account the diversity of identities within the city, and that helps develop a sense of protected, local solidarity."
