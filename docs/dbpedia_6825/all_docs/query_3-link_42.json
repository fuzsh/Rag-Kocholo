        "text": "This article explores rabbinic traditions that see in the character of Joseph a figure of uncertain sexual orientation. I examine a series of rabbinic and biblical texts in which an unconventional gender dynamic may be present. While it is true that these biblical and rabbinic texts ran contrary to the normative ideational and behaviorally prescriptive traditions concerning sexuality presented by the main body of biblical and rabbinic texts, it is nonetheless true that the texts I examine invite readers to see an alternative dynamic through their stories. I will employ a variety of methodologies, including philological/critical scholarship, close literary reading, and queer theory, through which we might most profitably examine the interpretative traditions I consider.\n\n6. Theodor, J. and Albeck, Ch., Bereshit Rabba with a Critical Apparatus and Commentary (Jerusalem: Wahrmann, 1965), 1008Google Scholar. Theodor-Albeck offers a wide variety of variant readings, in particular with respect to the morpheme משמשם. This appears to be a hypercorrection for מסמסם, from the root סמם (Steven E. Fassberg, personal communication, May 2, 2016). Considering the midrashic context, it would appear that the rabbis intimate that Joseph ground up ingredients (as in preparing a mixture in a mortar and pestle) and “applied it” to his eyes. Alternatively, if one chose to read the variant ממשמש, one would understand that Joseph “touched up” his eyes. See below.\n\n7. Or possibly “curl.” See Ulmer, Rivka, Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2009), 248CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Joshua Levinson has suggested depilation as a possible midrashic reference, see “Cultural Androgyny in Rabbinic Literature,” in From Athens to Jerusalem: Medicine in Hellenized Jewish Lore and in Early Christian Literature, ed. Kottek, Samuel, Horstmanshoff, Manfred, Baader, Gerhard, and Ferngren, Gary (Rotterdam: Erasmus, 2000), 136Google Scholar. If the latter is intended, one might have expected additional midrashim to focus on the episode of shaving Joseph's body hair in Genesis 41:14 as a source of rabbinic concern. However, it does not appear to be the case; see e.g., Bereshit Rabbah 89:9; Kasher, Menahem, Encyclopedia of Biblical Interpretation, a Millennial Anthology (Torah Shelemah) [in Hebrew] (New York: American Biblical Encyclopedia Society, 1938), 6:1539–40Google Scholar. In Bamidbar Rabbah 10:10 the shaving of Joseph is singled out as something done for beauty. The medievals seem to be divided with respect to precisely what hair Joseph shaved (Ibn Ezra, Bekhor Shor, Naḥmanides) but none appear to regard it with opprobrium. For a modern perspective, see Fried, Lisbeth S., “Why Did Joseph Shave?,” Biblical Archaeology Review 33, no. 4 (2007): 36–41Google Scholar, 74. I am grateful to Ms. Osi Drori for her stimulating questions about this particular episode, when she attended my presentation, אורינטציה מינית בתיאור דמותו של יוסף במקרא, בספרות הרבנית ופרשנות ימי הבינים, at the World Congress of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem, August 10, 2017.\n\n9. Lori Lefkovitz, in an essay otherwise replete with insightful observations, states that Bereshit Rabbah employs this identical description (“apply make-up to his eyes, fix his hair and dangle his heel”) for Abel; see Lefkovitz, Lori, “Not a Man: Joseph and the Character of Masculinity in Judaism and Islam,” in Gender in Judaism and Islam: Common Lives, Uncommon Heritage, ed. Kashani-Sabet, Firoozeh and Wenger, Beth S. (New York: New York University Press, 2015), 155–80Google Scholar. However, I cannot find any such reference to Abel; the closest thing is the observation of the midrash that when the “evil inclination” sees a person engaging in these behaviors, he states “that man is mine!” (Bereshit Rabbah 22:6 [Theodor-Albeck, 1:211–12]). Lefkovitz also treats this midrash in “Coats and Tales: Joseph Stories and Myths of Jewish Masculinity,” in A Mensch among Men: Explorations in Jewish Masculinity, ed. Brod, Harry (Freedom, CA: Crossing Press, 1988), 21Google Scholar.\n\n13. This argument may be considered fraught, of course, for how does one determine attitudes towards deeds or objects whose “gender” in antiquity might be completely other than what our own contemporary world assigns them? For example, consider Sara Elise Phang's discussion of whether so-called “feminine objects” found in Roman military archaeological sites necessarily indicate the presence of women in the camps, or whether the objects might belong as well to men. See The Marriage of Roman Soldiers (13 B.C.–A.D. 235): Law and Family in the Imperial Army (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 127–28Google Scholar, and in particular, nn. 42–25. I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer for pointing me towards this source.\n\n22. As the nineteenth-century rabbinic exegete R. Samuel David Luzzato cautioned, “The fourth principle [of biblical exegesis] … is the love of truth. It should be the purpose of our endeavor to discern the truth of the writers’ intentions. Nor should there be in the chambers of our hearts a desire to discover in the Holy Scriptures a sustenance and strengthening for faith and theology that have come to us from other sources, whether they be of philosophical logic or beliefs about the [Bible]”; Luzzato, Samuel David, introduction to Commentary on the Book of Isaiah [in Hebrew] (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1970), viiiGoogle Scholar.\n\n27. Joshua Levinson has dealt with this episode in rabbinic literature in two extensive and well-argued articles: see “An-Other Woman: Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. Staging the Body Politic,” Jewish Quarterly Review 87, nos. 3–4 (1997): 269–301CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and “Cultural Androgyny in Rabbinic Literature,” 119–40. As I was unaware of these articles when I undertook my own study, my initial approach to the Joseph material was virtually exclusively historical-critical and diachronic; Levinson's interest in the material was quite different, therefore, from my own. As he explicitly states, his focus is the “use of gender discourse to establish cultural identity, that is, how discourses of gender were employed to produce and police discourses of identity in the social formation of rabbinic Judaism” (“An-Other Woman,” 274–75; “Cultural Androgyny,” 133–36). However, prodded by an anonymous reviewer, I have come to understand the importance of the kinds of questions Levinson (and others) have posed. I will return to these questions below.\n\n31. The trope of Joseph's beauty continued to be developed in other literary genres in the Middle Ages. Consider, for example, a homoerotic Hebrew poem by Isaac ibn Mar Saul that compares the beauty of a young boy to several beautiful male biblical characters, Joseph among them: צבי חשוק באספמיה / יצרו רב עלילה / והמשילו והשליטו / עלי…/ יפה תואר כיריח …/ כמו יוסף בצורתו… “Beloved gazelle in Spain, crafted by Divine Master / who has enabled him to rule and master / Me … / Beautiful of stature as the moon / like Joseph in his form”; see Schirmann, Jefim, Studies in the History of Hebrew Poetry and Drama [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1979), 145–46Google Scholar. This poem was translated elegantly, if less literally, by Scheindlin, Raymond P., Wine, Women, & Death: Medieval Hebrew Poems on the Good Life (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1986), 87Google Scholar. For yet another translation and a discussion, see Lowin, Arabic and Hebrew Love Poems in Al-Andalus, chapter 2: “‘He Has Slain Me Like Uriah’: Ibn Mar Shaul's Unexpected Love Triangle.”\n\n41. A similar rabbinic narrative, redolent of the גפפ/נשק language employed here, is found in Midrash Shir Ha-shirim 8:1: אמ״ר פנחס מעשה בשני אחים שהיה אחד במירון ואחד בגוש חלב נפלה דליקה בבית זה שהיה במרון ובאת אחותו מגוש חלב התחילה מגפפתו ומחבקתו ומנשקתו ואומרת לית דא מבדה לי דהוה אחי באננקי ונתפלט ממנה, “Said R. Pinḥas: It happened with two siblings, one of whom was in Meron and one of whom was in Gush Ḥalav. A fire befell the house in Meron and his sister came from Gush Ḥalav, and began to embrace him, hug him, and kiss him. She said to him ‘there is not one who can despise me, for he is, perforce, my brother.’ And he ran away from her.” Note that the brother here, at least, is concerned that the nature of the physical contact is inappropriate to siblings. I am grateful to Naama A. Weiss for bringing this midrash to my attention, and for our fruitful discussions about it.\n\n42. Hasan-Rokem, Galit, The Web of Life: Folklore in Rabbinic Literature. The Palestinian Aggadic Midrash Eikha Rabba [in Hebrew] (Tel Aviv: ‘Am ‘Oved, 1996), 29–36Google Scholar. For a contrary perspective, cf. Fraenkel, Yonah, Sipur ha-’agadah, ’aḥdut shel tokhen ṿe-ẓurah: Koveẓ meḥkarim (Tel Aviv: Ha-kibbutz Ha-me'uḥad, 2001), 236–52Google Scholar, especially p. 247 n. 50. I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer for pointing me to this contemporary discussion. To be sure, the verbs גפפ and נשק are often found together in rabbinic literature, and not always with erotic connotation. For example, with respect to the question asked of R. Eliezer by a “wise woman” (B. Yoma 66b), about the inconsistency of divine punishment of Israel following the incident of the Golden Calf, the Talmud observes איתמר רב ולוי חד אמר זיבח וקיטר בסייף גפף ונישק במיתה, “It was said by Rav and Levi: one said, ‘He who sacrificed and burned incense, [his punishment is] by sword; he who embraced and kissed [the calf, his punishment is by divine] execution.’” Similarly, in Shir Ha-shirim Rabbah 5:16:3, it is reported that the heavenly angels attempted a kind of resuscitation on the Children of Israel upon seeing them swoon (lit. “die”) following God's opening speech at Mount Sinai, כך כשדיבר הקב'ה עם ישראל אנכי ה’ מיד פרחה נשמתן. כיון שמתו התחילו המלאכים מגפפין ומנשקין אותם, “So it was when the Holy One spoke with Israel, ‘I am the Lord …,’ immediately their souls flew off. Since they had died, they [the angels] embraced them and kissed them.” Nonetheless, particularly with regard to the pathos of this aggadic narrative, it seems to me that Hasan-Rokem makes the better case.\n\n44. See Leviticus 18:22, 20:13, and the ways these verses have almost universally been interpreted in rabbinic literature (e.g., B. Sanhedrin 54ab; B. Yevamot 83b). An analogous rabbinic aversion was typically expressed also with respect to otherwise licit heterosexual touching that might lead to love-making (דרך חיבה ותאוה, “the way of affection and desire”) that is forbidden at specific times, e.g., during a woman's menstrual cycle. The sources on the subject are numerous; see, e.g., B. Shabbat 13a, and Rashi there: even ostensibly innocuous activities, such as eating together, let alone kissing and caressing, are forbidden מפני שמתוך שמתיחדין יבא לבעול, “because they are alone together, he may come to have intercourse [with her].”\n\n45. In the rabbinic imagination, Mrs. Potiphar's interest in Joseph was preceded by that of her husband. See B. Sotah 13b where, wondering why the Bible calls Potiphar סריס פרעה, often translated as “a courtier of Pharaoh” but which also could be understood as “a eunuch,” the Talmud reports this wordplay-based interpretation: ויקנהו פוטיפר סריס פרעה: אמר רב שקנאו לעצמו. בא גבריאל ופירעו. מעיקרא כתיב פוטיפר, ולבסוף פוטיפרע, “And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's bought him [Genesis 39:1]: Rav said: He bought him for himself, but Gabriel came and mutilated him. Originally his name was written ‘Potiphar’ [i.e., here in Genesis 39:1] but afterwards ‘Potiphera’ [Genesis 41:45].” In other words, playing on Rabbinic Hebrew פרע, “to destroy, mutilate,” “Potiphar” was mutilated, “Potiphera,” thus becoming a eunuch. See also Bereshit Rabbah 86:3.\n\n46. See what is for the Bible a lengthy description, Genesis 39:8–10, in particular Joseph's statement, “You are [my master's] wife. How then could I do this most wicked thing, and sin before God?” For ancient interpretations that describe Joseph's exemplary moral character in this episode, see Kugel, Traditions of the Bible, 442–43. One text Kugel presents there emphasizes this dimension in particular (4 Maccabees 2:2–4): “It is for this reason, certainly, that the temperate Joseph is praised, because by mental effort he overcame sexual desire. For when he was young and in his prime, by his reason he nullified the frenzy of his passions. Not only is reason proved to rule over the frenzied urge of sexual desire, but also over every desire.”\n\n47. Indeed, it seems that she functioned as with magician's stagecraft: with one sweep of her hand she whisked Joseph's cloak off his body like the magician does when pulling a tablecloth off a table under a stack of champagne glasses! See Kugel, In Potiphar's House, 97. Even if one were to imagine rabbinic understanding of slave clothing as minimal and easily removed, the almost ineluctable movement of “clothed to naked” seems overly brisk. Gordon J. Wenham, Genesis 16–50 (Waco, TX: Word Books, 1994), 376, writes, “To pull … garments off against the wearer's will must have involved surprise and violence”; to this, I would add, “unless the wearer was complicit.” See his citation of Haran, Menahem, “Clothing (מלבושים),” in Encyclopedia mikra'it (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1962), 4:1034–50Google Scholar (note in particular photographs and images, 1035–44).\n\n50. B. Sotah 36b. See Rashi on Genesis 39:11, who echoes this talmudic passage. Islamic tradition, as well, reports that Joseph and Mrs. Potiphar (there, “the wife of al-‘Aziz”) intended to consummate their attraction for one another. As Shari Lowin describes, “the wife of al-‘Aziz lay before him and he sat between her legs, or Joseph loosened her clothes as she lay before him, and/or he loosened his own, or he ‘sat with her as a man sits with his wife’”; see Lowin, Arabic and Hebrew Love Poems in Al-Andalus, chapter 7, “The Cloak of Joseph.” Lowin also notes (n. 96) that other Islamic interpreters state that “she managed to untie seven knots on Joseph's trousers before Joseph came to his senses and raced out of the room.”\n\n56. Bereshit Rabbah 87:7 (Theodor-Albeck 3:1072); see also Y. Horayot 46d. With respect to Joseph, approaching the moment of climax, and seeing his father's image, Dalia Marx writes, “It is hard not to notice an Oedipal undertone in the midrash about Joseph encountering the image of his father while he is in a woman's bed. The image of the ‘great father’ appears in the middle of the sexual act, cools off his son's passion and denies his manhood.” See Dalia Marx, “Joseph and Gender Complexity,” Parsha E-letter, Vayeshev (Genesis 37:1–40:23) (December 2014), http://rhr.org.il/eng/2014/12/joseph-and-potiphars-wife-gender-compexity/. Levinson, “An-Other Woman: Joseph and Potiphar's Wife,” 299, also draws our attention to what he terms “the Freudian family romance,” but particularly stresses the cultural dimension that is his main point: “Why would Joseph's act of adultery result in the subsequent loss of his patrimonial connections? By cross-coding the gender and the cultural codes, not only is the foreign other troped as female, but masculine sexual identity … becomes a sine qua non of cultural identity” (298).\n\n64. See below. In Rashi's oft-cited methodological statement (in his commentary on Genesis 3:8), this might thus be considered an instance of אגדה המיישבת דבר המקרא ומשמעו, “an aggadah that settles a matter of Scripture and its sense.” On my reading of this methodological statement, along with a slight emendation of the received version, see most recently Robert A. Harris, “What's in a Blessing? Rashi and the Priestly Benediction of Numbers 6:22–27,” in Birkat Kohanim: The Priestly Benediction in Jewish Tradition, ed. Martin Cohen and David Birnbaum (New York: New Paradigm Matrix, 2016), 254 n. 10. Having recently examined Rashi's commentary in the authoritative, thirteenth-century Leipzig MS Hebrew 1 during a visit to that city, I will take this opportunity to correct one aspect of that note: contrary to what I write there, Rashi's methodological statement does survive in the manuscript, though partly faded and partly deficient due to some degree of medieval damage. Despite the unique reading in the manuscript, which I will address in a future study, the fundamental idea remains the same.\n\n70. In an otherwise anomalous interpretation of Genesis 35:22, David Kimḥi holds that following the birth of his twelve sons, Jacob abstained from further sexual relations with any of his wives and, monk-like, devoted himself exclusively to the worship of God. (וישמע ישראל: ופירש מן האשה, זהו שאמר: ויהיו בני יעקב שנים עשר, כי לא היה עוד בן והיה פרוש עוד כל ימיו מאשה ומדרכי העולם והתעסק בעבודת האל, זהו שאמר: והיה ה‘ לי לאלהים “And Israel heard: And he separated himself from the woman, as it is said: And the sons of Jacob were twelve. Indeed, he had no more children after that, and he remained celibate and removed from the ways of the world all the remaining days of his life, and occupied himself with the worship of God, as it says: And the LORD shall be my God [Genesis 28:21].”) No analogous medieval commentary of which I am aware offers any remotely comparable interpretation of Joseph's lack of further progeny after Ephraim and Manasseh.\n\n75. אין המקרא הזה אומר אלא דרשני “This verse says nothing other than ‘expound me’!” The formula is famously found in Rashi's first midrashic interpretation of Genesis 1:1. Surprisingly, the complete expression does not appear elsewhere in rabbinic literature (though elements of it do), but one may state that the sentiment behind Rashi's gloss animates virtually the entirety of midrashic enterprise with respect to biblical verses. See the observation by J. D. Eisenstein, ’Oẓar Midrashim: A Library of Two Hundred Minor Midrashim [in Hebrew] (New York: Noble Offset Printers, 1915), vii: למלאכת הדרוש האגדי השתמשו בכל פסוקי תנ”ך כ”ז שהיו יכולים להוציא מהם איזה דבר טוב ומועיל, ובפרט הפסוקים הקשים והסתומים, ומורגל בפיהם לומר אין המקרא הזה אומר אלא דרשני “For the purpose of expounding narrative [the sages] used all of the Bible's verses on any occasion that they could derive from them some worthy or useful teaching, and especially with respect to difficult and obscure verses, and they were accustomed to saying, ‘This verse says nothing other than expound me.’” On this formula, see also the addenda to Berliner, Abraham, Rashi on the Torah: The Commentary of Solomon B. Isaac (Berlin: Levant, 1866)Google Scholar, 182b n. 1.\n\n85. Marx, “Joseph and Gender Complexity,” cites only the midrash in B. Berakhot 60a, and concludes: “The author of the midrash seems to feel there is something essentially feminine about Joseph. He explains it with the judgment Leah passed upon herself and her sensitivity towards her sister, worrying that if Rachel gave birth to fewer males than the handmaids it would disgrace her. That is why she had the fetuses switched: the fetus in her womb turned into a girl, namely Dinah, whereas Rachel, who was supposed to give birth to a daughter, had a son—Joseph. This midrash explains … Joseph's latent femininity.” However, without referencing the expansive translation of the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which explicitly mentions the switching of the fetuses (but even at that, not that the male fetus “turned into a girl”), she deduces implications from the Bavli that are not explicitly present in that text.\n\n86. Thinking about the targum's midrash from a reader-response perspective, were one to want to suggest a gender relationship of some kind between the two fetuses that results in the births of Joseph and Dinah, one might build an interesting case through reference to quantum information processing. Quantum computing relies on two basic principles of quantum mechanics: superposition, meaning that a quantum “object” essentially occupies multiple states at the same time; and entanglement, whereby two or more quantum objects can share their states even if they are separated from one another by great distances. Based on these quantum mechanical principles, one might consider Joseph and Dinah in the wombs of Rachel and Leah as an entangled quantum system, instantaneously sharing their quantum states (via superposition and entanglement). In any case, through quantum computing one can measure or otherwise understand the relationship between what had appeared to be two separate objects, but which are really one and the same; see https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/quantum-computing-101. For a wonderful prose explanation of quantum computing, see Phillip Ball, “How Quantum Mechanics Could Be Even Weirder,” The Atlantic, June 22, 2016, http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/quantum-mechanics-weird/487691/. I am grateful to my friend, Dr. Shalom Wind, of the Columbia University Applied Physics Department, for introducing me to this subject.\n\n93. According to several midrashim, Jacob knew he had endangered his ostensibly favorite son by sending him to his brothers (Genesis 37:12–13); see Kasher, Torah shelemah, 6:1408–11, and notes there. For an Islamic interpretive tradition that Jacob endangered Joseph even as he intuited his brothers’ hatred for him, see Sura 12:11–13: “They said, “O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors? Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians. [Jacob] said, ‘Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware.’” I have cited this from the text found at The Noble Quran, www.quran.com. On this sura and its treatment in post-Quranic commentary and medieval Islamic poetry, see Lowin, Arabic and Hebrew Love Poems in Al-Andalus, chap. 7, “The Cloak of Joseph.”\n\n95. Biblical Hebrew רכות might mean “weak” or “soft.” Ibn Ezra refers to a Karaite interpreter (with whom he disagrees) who believes that an initial aleph has elided, and that the word should be understood as though it were ארכות. Assuming that the Karaite did not simply mean that Leah's eyes were “long,” that is, “almond-shaped,” presumably, the meaning would then be “crusty, scabby,” that is, in need of healing; see the word אֲרֻכַת, “healing,” in Jeremiah 8:17: כִּי מַדּוּעַ לֹא עָלְתָה אֲרֻכַת בַּת־עַמִּי, “Why has the healing of the daughter of my people not arisen?” While an Arabic cognate might have led either Karaite or Rabbanite exegete to think of this interpretation, it is curious that there is a rabbinic midrash that might also have contributed. In B. Bava Batra 123a a midrash relates the circumstances through which Leah's eyes became “injured” or “weak”: ?כתיב: ועיני לאה רכות. מאי רכות … רב אמר: לעולם רכות ממש ולא גנאי הוא לה אלא שבח הוא לה, שהיתה שומעת על פרשת דרכים בני אדם שהיו אומרים שני בנים יש לה לרבקה, שתי בנות יש לו ללבן, גדולה לגדול וקטנה לקטן, והיתה יושבת על פרשת דרכים, ומשאלת: גדול, מה מעשיו? איש רע הוא, מלסטם בריות; קטן, מה מעשיו? איש תם יושב אוהלים, והיתה בוכה עד שנשרו ריסי עיניה, “It is written And the eyes of Leah were weak. What [is meant by] weak? … Rav said: indeed [her eyes] actually were weak—but that was no disgrace to her but a credit. For at the crossroads she heard people saying: Rebecca has two sons, [and] Laban has two daughters; the elder [daughter should be married] to the elder [son] and the younger [daughter should be married] to the younger [son]. And she sat at the crossroads and inquired: ‘The elder one, what are his deeds?' [And the answer came that he was] a wicked man, a highway robber. ‘How does the younger man conduct himself?’—‘A quiet man dwelling in tents.’ And she wept until her eyelashes dropped.”\n\n98. Ibn Ezra (commentary on Genesis 39:6) quite tersely expresses recognition of the connection between the description of Joseph's beauty and Rachel's in a single word: כאמו, “[Joseph's beauty is] like his mother's.” See Cohen, Menachem, Mikra’ot gedolot “Ha-keter”: A Revised and Augmented Scientific Edition of ‘Mikra’ot Gedolot’ Based on the Aleppo Codex and Early Medieval Mss, vol. 2, Genesis (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1999), 113Google Scholar. Bereshit Rabbah likewise observes the connection between the biblical narrator's description of Rachel's beauty, and of Joseph's; see Bereshit Rabbah 86:6 (Theodor-Albeck 2:1059). A contemporary commentator writes, “This sort of language in reference to male beauty is unusual in the Bible and draws our attention for that reason if no other. But in addition it teaches us something about Jacob's reasons for feeling so close to this particular son.… Joseph resembled his mother and so was a constant reminder of her for the bereaved Jacob.” See Cotter, David W., Genesis (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2003), 291Google Scholar.\n\n101.

Although I have considered the potential of ancient Semitics to aid in understanding the root n-‘ -r in some sort of sense indicating sexual arousal, I have thus far been unsuccessful. In fact, the only occasion when I have found such a suggestion in print was in a surprising (and unsubstantiated) source, Braude's English translation of Bialik-Rawnitzki's Sefer ha-’aggadah: “The commentator seems to take na‘ar as a nominal form of the stem ‘r (‘to awake, to become sexually mature’).” Following this observation, the editor adds: “So Rabbi Julius Kravitz of Tucson, Ariz.” Ḥayim Naḥman Bialik and Yehoshu‘a Hana Rawnitzki, The Book of Legends equals Sefer Ha-Aggadah: Legends From the Talmud and Midrash, trans.

Greenstein, “Verbal Art and Literary Sensibilities in Ancient Near Eastern Context,” in The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Ancient Israel, ed. Susan Niditch (Chichester: Wiley Blackwell, 2016), 471–72. Greenstein notes that “a special type of literary art that was oriented to the eye was the scribal joke.… A cuneiform scribe may write a word in a surprising or punning manner for the amusement of his colleagues” (471). See also Ilana Pardes, Countertraditions in the Bible: A Feminist Approach (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992), 104–5, where the author treats the ambiguity of the morpheme [ושכבת[י, and interprets it as not necessarily an archaism but rather as a deliberate plot device employed to provide additional nuances of meaning in the narrative. I am grateful to Edward L. Greenstein for this reference.\n\n118. Making this distinction between the sons of the concubines and Joseph's “other” brothers is in keeping with the typical way in which proponents of the Documentary Hypothesis divide the chapter; see, e.g., Richard Elliott Friedman, The Bible with Sources Revealed: A New Look into the Five Books of Moses (New York: Harper SanFrancisco, 2003), 92–93. See Rashbam, who makes a similar distinction in his comment on the phrase היה רועה את אחיו בצאן, “He shepherded with his brothers among the sheep,” in Genesis 37:2. See also Ginzberg, Legends, 5:326 n. 9.\n\n119. On Jacob as an egocentric character see Meir Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985), 474. For other studies that have helped me frame my contention that the narrator of Genesis presents the character of Jacob, throughout, as egocentric and self-centered, see: John Edward Anderson, Jacob and the Divine Trickster: A Theology of Deception and Yhwh's Fidelity to the Ancestral Promise in the Jacob Cycle (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2011); Susan Niditch, A Prelude to Biblical Folklore: Underdogs and Tricksters (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000), 93–125; Richard D. Patterson, “The Old Testament Use of an Archetype: The Trickster,” Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 42, no. 3 (1999): 385–94; Yair and Valerie Zakovitch, Jacob: Unexpected Patriarch (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012).\n\n120. The reader learns that Dinah spends the entirety of Genesis 34 in the household of Schechem (and Hamor), as she is only freed by Simon and Levi's rescue in v. 26: וַיִּקְחוּ אֶת־דִּינָה מִבֵּית שְׁכֶם וַיֵּצֵאוּ, “They [Simon and Levi] took Dinah from the house of Schechem and they left.” See Sternberg, Poetics of Biblical Narrative, 441–82. I am aware that Sternberg's reading of this narrative has been challenged by, inter alia, Fewell and Gunn; nonetheless, I am persuaded by the essential claims of Sternberg's interpretation. Cf. Danna Nolan Fewell and David M. Gunn, “Tipping the Balance: Sternberg's Reader and the Rape of Dinah,” Journal of Biblical Literature 110, no. 2 (1991): 193–211; see Sternberg's rejoinder, “Biblical Poetics and Sexual Politics: From Reading to Counter-Reading,” Journal of Biblical Literature 111, no. 3 (1992): 476–79.

Insofar as Zarhi is a poet, I give her wide birth to imagine the world of biblical narrative and to state its truth as she wishes to recompose it, so to speak. It is a different case altogether, I think, when modern writers impute their own reality to ancient (or medieval) circumstances. A case in point is Rachel Adelman's reading of Leah Goldberg's poem, “Jacob and Rachel.” Adelman writes, “While in Genesis, Leah ‘becomes’ Rachel on the wedding night (Genesis 29:23–25, and Rashi on Genesis 29:23–25), the poem suggests the inverse exchange of identities.” However, where Adelman might be on solid ground in her interpretation of the twentieth-century Hebrew poem, she has overread Rashi (on v. 25), who draws no such conclusion. See Rachel Adelman, “Breaking the Distaff of Silence: The Voice of Rachel the Matriarch in Modern Israeli Poetry,” in The Bible Retold by Jewish Artists, Writers, Composers and Filmmakers, ed. Helen Leneman and Barry Dov Walfish (Sheffield: Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2015), 63.\n\n136. Levinson, “An-Other Woman,” 272; see n. 9, there, for additional bibliography. In general, the character of Joseph as presented in the postbiblical Judean literature is much “flatter” and more one-dimensional than in rabbinic literature, and more consistently and conventionally “pious and chaste.” See, e.g., the Testament of Joseph (especially chapters 1–9) within the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs narrative (“I struggled with a shameless woman who kept prodding me to transgress with her, but the God of my father rescued me from the burning flame.”) in James H. Charlesworth, The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983), 819–21; Josephus, in Antiquities 2.4.2–5 (41–54) in H. St. J. Thackeray, Josephus in Nine [I.e. Ten] Volumes, vol. 4, Jewish Antiquities, books 1–4 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; W. Heinemann, 1961), 184–95; Philo, “On Joseph,” 9–10 (44–52) in F. H. Colson, G. H. Whitaker, and Ralph Marcus, Philo: In Ten Volumes (and Two Supplementary Volumes): with an English Translation, vol. 4 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; W. Heinemann, 1984), 162–69.\n\n146. An excerpt from Rosen-Zvi's citation and translation of this passage should suffice to clarify his point about the violence in the rabbinic text: “At that time R. Tarfon recited this verse: ‘I saw the ram goring westward and northward, and all the animals were unable to stand against it …’ (Daniel 8:4)—[this is] R. Akiba. ‘As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth …’ (ibid., 5)—this is Jose Haglili and his answer. ‘And he came to the ram with the two horns … and he ran at him in his mighty wrath … he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns’ (ibid., 7)—this is R. Akiba and R. Simon b. Nanas. ‘And the ram had no power to stand before him’ (ibid.)—this is Akiba, ‘but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him’ (ibid.)—this is R. Yose Haglili, ‘And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power’ (ibid.)—these are the thirty-two elders who voted in Lydda and declared it clean.”\n\n151. To draw this essay's case more precisely, one might contrast the sages’ treatment of the Joseph narrative with their virtual neglect of the biblical narrative that features the relationship between David and Jonathan. Despite the strong affection of Jonathan for David described by the biblical narrator, and despite the powerful, even if enigmatic, expression of love David expresses for Jonathan in the lament for his fallen friend, rabbinic midrash is all but utterly silent on the relationship between the two. Whatever biblical evidence to the contrary contemporary readers might find in supporting this as a homoerotic relationship, ancient and medieval rabbis seem uninterested in it for almost any purposes. For the few rabbinic notices, see B. Sanhedrin 104a (on 1 Samuel 20:42); M. Avot 5:16; Yalkut Shimoni, part 2, remez 141 (on 2 Samuel 1:26; see David Kimḥi and Gersonides there).\n\n153.
