        "text": "IN MANY WAYS, MY TIME LIVING AT TOM HOUSE WAS DEFINED BY STUART SANDFORD. NOT ONLY WERE HIS WORKS PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN THE HOUSE DURING MY RESIDENCY, BUT HE SHEPHERDED ME AROUND THE QUEER ART SCENE IN LA. I WON’T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP, BUT LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY, HE’S A REAL PAL AND A TRUE LOVER OF THE ARTS. STUART’S WORK SPANS THE EROTIC GAMUT: PHOTO, SCULPTURE, FILM, WRITING, AND CURATION. HIS WORK HAS BEEN FEATURED IN SOLO AND GROUP EXHIBITIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AS WELL AS IN NUMEROUS PUBLICATIONS— MY FAVORITE, “THE HOUSE OF STUART” IN LALA MAGAZINE. ALTHOUGH STUART IS BACK IN HIS HOMELAND (MERRY ENGLAND), HE IS PARTICIPATING IN AN ONLINE EXHIBITION VIA CULTUREEDIT / TOM OF FINLAND STORE IN CONJUNCTION WITH TOM’S 100TH BIRTHDAY. THE WORK IS A CELEBRATION OF THE SAME IDEALS TOM BELIEVED IN— GAY JOY AND LIBERATED SEXUALITY. CHECK OUT THE SHOW ONLINE, AND PURSUE AVAILABLE WORKS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRODIGAL RETURN TO LA, STUART!!!\n\nJAMISON KARON: WHAT WERE YOU DOING CREATIVELY THAT ORIGINALLY LED YOU TO TOM HOUSE?\n\nSTUART SANDFORD: I’D RECENTLY BEGUN WORKING ON A NEW SCULPTURAL PROJECT (MY ONGOING SEBASTIAN PROJECT) AND HAD SPOKEN ABOUT IT WITH GARY EVERETT, THE THEN DIRECTOR OF HOMOTOPIA (THE UK’S BIGGEST QUEER ARTS FESTIVAL). HE’D WORKED WITH DURK DEHNER AND TOM OF FINLAND FOUNDATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND SET UP A MEETING AT TATE BRITAIN WHILST I WAS STILL IN LONDON.\n\nWHAT WAS LIVING AT THE HOUSE LIKE IN THE BEGINNING?\n\nIT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ADJUST INITIALLY AS THE SPACE OPERATES ESSENTIALLY AS BOTH COMMUNAL LIVING SPACE AND ALSO GALLERY/MUSEUM OPEN TO THE PUBLIC SO THERE’S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR PRIVACY AND ALONE TIME, WHICH IS SOMETHING I THRIVE WITH. IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING INTO THE RHYTHM OF THE SPACE.\n\nHOW DID YOU INITIALLY DECIDE TO DO A SERIES OF POLAROIDS (1421 LAVETA TERRACE)?\n\nI’D BEEN WORKING WITH PHOTOGRAPHY IN MY PRACTICE SINCE ART SCHOOL BUT HAD NEVER REALLY WORKED WITH POLAROIDS. I WANTED TO CHALLENGE MYSELF WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHILST ALSO PAYING HOMAGE TO A VERY SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE AND POLAROID ABSOLUTELY LENDS ITSELF TO THOSE MOMENTS, THOSE NEVER TO BE REPEATED MOMENTS, MOMENTS OF SPONTANEITY, OF EROTICISM, OF STILLNESS, AND BEAUTY. I CONTACTED POLAROID AND THEY SPONSORED THE PROJECT, PROVIDING ME WITH A CAMERA AND AS MUCH FILM AS I COULD SHOOT.\n\nTHOSE POLAROIDS ARE VERY SENTIMENTAL TO ME, BECAUSE I DID MY RESIDENCY NOT LONG AFTER YOURS, AND IN MANY WAYS THEY REFLECT MY OWN EXPERIENCE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE INSTANTANEOUS MOMENTS, AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT?\n\nTHE GREAT THING ABOUT A POLAROID CAMERA IS HOW SMALL IT IS, WHICH MAKES POINTING IN PEOPLES FACES AND OTHER PLACES QUITE EASY AND MUCH LESS INTIMIDATING THAN, SAY, A FULL SIZE SLR WITH LENSES AND FLASHES. IT’S THE REASON I’VE ALWAYS USED 35MM POINT AND SHOOT CAMERAS TOO, THEY LEND THEMSELVES TO THESE INSTANTANEOUS MOMENTS.\n\nYOUR WORK, PARTICULARLY YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, BRINGS MEMORIES OF OUR ESCAPADES IN LA. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PERSONAL NATURE OF YOUR WORK?\n\nI HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH 99% OF THE PEOPLE THAT I PHOTOGRAPH, EITHER AS FRIEND OR LOVER AND WHEN I STARTED TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS I WAS FOLLOWING A SNAPSHOT AESTHETIC POPULARIZED BY MANY ARTIST-PHOTOGRAPHERS BEGINNING WITH WOLFGANG TILLMANS AND NAN GOLDIN. I WANTED THEM TO FEEL RAW AND VULNERABLE AND INTIMATE AND EVEN IF THEY ARE STAGED/RESTAGED THEY STILL DOCUMENT A MOMENT IN MY LIFE AND THOSE IN MY ORBIT.\n\nDID YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS CHANGE WHILE LIVING AT TOM HOUSE?\n\nI DON’T THINK LIVING THERE CHANGED MY ART PRACTICE PER SE BUT I DID BECOME INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LARGER MORE COMMUNITY FOCUSED PROJECTS, LIKE THE QUEER BIENNIAL FOR EXAMPLE, AND I’M GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF SHAPING THAT AS THE FILM CURATOR SINCE ITS INCEPTION.\n\nYOUR WORK SPANS MANY MEDIUMS, FROM PHOTOGRAPHY, TO SCULPTURE, TO FILM. ALL FORMS WHICH ARE REPRESENTED IN THE NEW EXHIBITION. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THESE FORMS INTERACT?\n\nALL MY WORK SHARES THE SAME CORE THEMES AND IDEAS THAT I WANT TO PRESENT AND EXPLORE, AND FOR ME IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT DICTATES THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEDIUM TO EXPRESS THAT IDEA.\n\nAS YOU KNOW, I’M QUITE FOND OF THE IMAGES OF BRENT CORRIGAN IN THE GARDEN. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO PHOTOGRAPH SUCH AN INFAMOUS PORN STAR? AND WHY IN THE GARDEN? HOW DID IT COME ABOUT?\n\nWELL BRENT WAS MY NUMBER ONE ALL TIME PORN STAR CRUSH SO IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE TO MEET HIM AND SHOOT HIM. I THINK HE HAD CONTACTED TOFF ABOUT POTENTIALLY HOSTING HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE HOUSE AND I ASKED HIM TO POSE FOR ME AND HE WAS VERY KEEN TO DO SO. I’D NEVER MET OR SHOT A PORN STAR BEFORE SO I WASN'T SURE HOW IT WOULD GO, BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF BEERS AND SOME TIME JUST CHATTING IT WAS A BREEZE. HE SURPRISED ME WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE AND SENSE OF HUMOUR. OH AND THE GARDEN WAS THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR THE SHOOT, SOMEWHERE CALM, PEACEFUL, BEAUTIFUL, AND SERENE AS I WANTED TO CAPTURE SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE NORM, AND I THINK I DID.\n\nAS YOUR WORK CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THEMES OF ADOLESCENT NARCISSISM REMAIN… BRENT CORRIGAN, SEBASTIAN, SEAN FORD… HOW DO THESE FIGURES CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR MESSAGE? AND HOW HAS THAT MESSAGE EVOLVED OVER TIME?\n\nGOOD QUESTION. HAS IT EVOLVED? I’M NOT SURE. IT’S DEFINITELY BECOME MORE MATURE AND MUCH MORE TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT BUT I THINK ALL TRUE ARTISTS ARE OBSESSED WITH SOME IDEA, SOME THEME, AND REALLY WE JUST MAKE THE SAME WORK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TRYING TO EXPLORE/PRESENT THAT IDEA OR THEME AND I THINK THAT’S OKAY.\n\nTHE SEBASTIAN RELIC SERIES HAS BEEN EVOLVING SINCE I MET YOU. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA TO HAVE FRIENDS AND PATRONS PEE ON THE BRONZE HEAD?\n\nI’D LOVE TO SAY THAT WAS MY IDEA BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A GALLERIST I WORK WITH THAT GAVE ME THE INITIAL IDEA. AS I WAS STAYING AT TOM HOUSE AT THE TIME, IT MADE SENSE TO MAKE USE OF THE SPACE AND THE PEOPLE THERE AND MAKE IT A COMMUNAL ART PROJECT FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT ORBIT AROUND TOM HOUSE.\n\nWHO IS PEEING IN THE VIDEO? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS FILM ADDS TO THE SCULPTURE?\n\nTHAT’S ACTUALLY A FRIEND OF OURS BRYCE, DON’T YOU RECOGNIZE HIS CUTE BUM? I TOOK SOME DOCUMENTATION PHOTOS WITH HIM AS WELL. I ALWAYS SAW THAT VIDEO IN MY MIND WHEN I STARTED THE PIECE, SLOW MOTION WITH PEE SPRAYING EVERYWHERE AND GLISTENING IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF THE GARDEN, A GOLDEN SHOWER FOR THE SEBASTIAN HEAD, IF YOU WILL.\n\nYOUR WORK POST TOM HOUSE CONTINUES TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THE SPACE. HOW HAS TOFF CREATED A PLATFORM FOR YOUR BRAND OF SEXUALITY?\n\nTHE WHOLE ETHOS OF TOM’S WORK, FOR ME, IS A CELEBRATION OF QUEER LOVE, SEX, AND DESIRE, AND I HOPE MY WORK RESONATES WITH THAT. I FEEL PART OF THE TOM HOUSE AND TOM OF FINLAND FAMILY AND CAN’T IMAGINE NOT COMING BACK TO THAT AMAZING SPACE AND CONTINUING A DIALOGUE.\n\nWHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NOW? AND WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME TO LA??\n\nI HAVE TWO NEW STATUES I’M WORKING ON THAT I HOPED TO HAVE FINISHED FOR THE SUMMER BUT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT COVID-19 STATE OF AFFAIRS WE ALL FIND OURSELVES IN, THEY WILL BE READY LATER IN THE YEAR. I’M ALSO FINALIZING MY FIRST BOOK SINCE 2017, WHICH IS OF MY POLAROID COLLAGES. I BEGAN THOSE AT THE END OF 2018 AND I’VE REALLY ENJOYED THE PROCESS OF MAKING THEM. THAT SHOULD BE OUT AROUND JUNE. OH AND I HOPE TO BE BACK IN LA END OF SUMMER IF ALL GOES WELL, IT FEELS LIKE HOME AND I MISS IT TERRIBLY.\n\n© 2020 CULTUREEDIT / Tom Of Finland Store\n\nDano Santana\n\nStuart Sandford\n\nD: I am a huge fan of your work.\n\nS: Thank you so much.\n\nD: I was introduced to your art and you as an artist because of the sculpture you did with Sebastian Sauvé. I feel like that is something you might hear a lot because you worked with him during those years when Sebastian was this kind of top model. He was getting a lot of recognition from the fashion industry and then all of a sudden, he is doing something with fine art, which was new and very cool.\n\nS: It was great actually because when I had the idea to do the statue, which was always intended to be the selfie statue, I didn’t know at the time who the statue would be of. But, actually, Sebastian was great. When I had the idea of Sebastian Sauvé, and in my mind he was perfect, I just emailed him. He told me he had seen one of my series, called Cumfaces, which coincidentally was actually the first time that worked with the selfie. The Cumfaces series was in 2007, followed by another series in 2010, which was also done with the selfie. The Sebastian statue is the sort of the third iteration of the selfie. So I had this continually evolving idea, and I just needed to find the right person.\n\nD: And Sebastian and the selfie?\n\nS: Sebastian was perfect. He has this fantastic classical profile. His nose, his lips, and his chin.\n\nD: Like a Greek God.\n\nS: Exactly, Greco-Roman sculptures and statues were one of the inspirations behind the work. Especially because one of the biggest inspirations was this real-life guy called Antinous. Antinous was Emperor Hadrian’s boy lover back in 120 AD, and he was supposed to be the most beautiful boy that ever lived. When Antinous died, Emperor Hadrian commissioned more statues, paintings and likenesses of him than any other figure in Greco-Roman History. Through that process, he became worshipped, and he became an idol, and people turned that into a religion. There are lots of statues of Antinous, but there is one significant statue, there is no real title or name, but some call it Standing. Anyways, he is in a position where he is looking slightly downwards, and his left arm is extended as though he could be looking at his hand, and so that was the pose that I had Sebastian stand in. He is looking into the camera and taking the selfie.\n\nD: Which is cool.\n\nS: Thank you, thank you.\n\nD: It’s also really cool for you to be in Mexico right now, and I don’t know if it was a coincidence because I do know that your friend Hector is here, but all of these interviews and all of these photoshoots going on are related to Pride because it is the month of June.\n\nS: Yeah, Pride month, yeah.\n\nD: Yes, Pride month and the big celebration will take place on the last Saturday of the month here in Mexico.\n\nS: Oh, I won’t be here then.\n\nD: Aw, well that’s our Pride. I always try to do something related to Pride, but I also want to do something interesting with people who are inside of the LGBTQI+ community; people that are trying to do more with the community, or trying to put out something like a statement. I know a little something about your art and you within the community, but can you tell us about your work in your own words?\n\nS: Sure, so I work with photography, and I work with sculpture, painting, installation. I graduated from art school in 2006, so I have been making work ever since then. For me, what the work is about is when we’re teenagers, and when we’re an adolescent, we are trying to figure out who we are, our identity, our sexuality. When we form these ideas and these opinions, we are gathering from our friends, from our parents, from media, from many different sources and many different influences, and it’s about trying to figure out who we are. That desire to understand is kind of where the basis for all my work is. Not only is it about discovering, but about building the person you are. And so sex and sexuality is imperative within that. When I first started taking photographs, and when the photographs slid into the sculptural work that I’ve been doing mostly more lately, I wasn’t really seeing a lot of celebration and a lot of celebratory depictions of LGBTQI+ people, and I wanted to do that, I wanted to show that. I want my work to always be fun, but not funny. I am very serious about my work but definitely fun and definitely celebratory, and definitely, it is necessary to be visible as LGBTQI+ people.\n\nD: Do your pieces have statements, or do you protest any sentiments through your work?\n\nS: That’s a good question. I feel it is not necessarily a statement because I don’t believe that artists should be telling you, and I don’t think they should be instructing you. I think they should be asking questions. I think they should be prompting you, and I believe that good art should make you think, and it should make you question, and again within visibility and depictions within gay men or lifestyles, I think that is the statement. It’s funny because I was talking with a fellow artist saying, ‘Oh maybe I should write a diary about my trip to Mexico, but also generally, I should write a diary.’ He is a painter, and what he was said to me is ‘Well, I don’t do that because my work is my diary, and it’s my statement.’ I think that should be true. So, I don’t have a specific statement, but my work very much speaks for me, or I want my work to speak for me. Also, I am very conscious that I am a gay man, that I am producing imagery that is gay or queer, and I actually like the word queer a lot. I really like that word. I think it is the visibility that is the most important and that is the statement that I want people to see, for people to feel, and the celebratory fact that yes we have oppression, and repression, and suppression in many, many countries. We face the death penalty for being LGBTQI+ in several countries, and so the visibility and the fact that we are here and we are queer is important.\n\nD: Yes!\n\nS: What is that from? It’s the we’re here, we’re queer, get used to it. It’s the big old statement from, is it ACT UP? I think it is an ACT UP thing?\n\nD: Yes it is a Queer Nation and ACT UP thing. Now, the next question is about your creative process. Can you tell us about how you have developed a piece or a series?\n\nS: It really depends. For example, the new sculpture, Ouroboros. Ouroboros is an ancient Egyptian symbol of the snake or serpent eating its own tail. It is a symbol of fertility, eternal youth, and the changing of the seasons. I have a collector from Switzerland who just came to me and said, ‘Oh, I would love to have a sculpture of a guy sucking his own dick,’ and I thought to myself, that’s kind of boring, I’m not into interested in that depiction. Although there is sex in my work, I don’t consider my work to be erotic. I am not interested in turning you on, I am interested in making you think, but not necessarily in giving you a hard-on. If that happens, then that is perfectly fine, but that is not my intention. So, when he came to me, I was a little unsettled, but then when I thought about it and was researching the idea of the Ouroboros, it made sense to create this figure, this very classical idea, and merge the two together. I had been working a lot with traditional concepts. Again, with the Sebastian, and with these historic materials again, the bronze and the marble. That’s the way that I was thinking, in a classical sense. Because I don’t just want to have a painting of a dick or a photograph of a dick and have no narrative to it. For me, the narrative is critical, and I want you to look at a piece of mine and assume that there is a narrative behind it. For example, with my photographic work, I always want you to think there is a narrative there, even if you’re just looking at one image, there is certainly a narrative behind it. I also like the idea that you look at my work as a whole. So you look at my photography, then into the sculptures, then into the paintings, and that you can see the narrative and this story that’s happening within the work becomes evident. I always want to make sure that there is a story you can connect to.\n\nD: For me, it is exciting to see that your work has a sense of fashion or edginess. Is that something you do intentionally, or does it just happen? For example, the Sebastian seems obviously connected to fashion because he is a well-known model, but with Cumfaces, there was something nuanced in the images that made it feel substantially fashionable, but also very clearly fine art.\n\nS: I definitely see that. When I first started taking photographs, I was very much influenced by photographers such as Wolfgang Tillmans, who comes from the sort of snapshot culture. Although he never did any fashion photography. And Nan Goldin, who also didn’t do fashion photography, but instead had the snapshot aesthetic. So I think what you are seeing came from that. Actually though, back in the day, I did a couple of fashion shoots, but I didn’t really enjoy it at all because I wasn’t in control. I had to tell a narrative that I suppose I wasn’t interested in telling. Someone else’s story. I definitely see it though, specifically within the photography and with the Sebastian statue. Because of who I chose, that choice does have that fashion edge, and that’s something I’m delighted to have. I mean, I very much consumed magazines when I was younger; The Face, ID, Dazed and Confused, which I think filters in too. Just like watching TV, it’s not a TV, but were watching billboards and advertisements just like we watch TV, it definitely filters into our psyche and into our consciousness.\n\nD: So was Sebastian a conscious or unconscious decision? Or a bit of both?\n\nS: The thing with Sebastian and being a fashion model was really interesting because I did want someone who was known, if you were in that world, you knew who he was. And if you weren’t in that world, then you didn’t kind of know or care. I definitely thought about the fact that he has an identity, and I knew I wanted to slightly remove him from the fashion world and take him into a fine art context. That was part of the process and the project itself. Now, the underwear he is wearing in the statue is Zara. He told me one story about when he went to a Zara casting for kids. Well, Sebastian is like 6’ 4, I mean, he’s huge. He turned up, and at first, they were like, ‘what the hell, he’s too big,’ and they were turning him away. But somehow, he did it, he got the job because they decided he had the perfect look for it in the end. Those are the underwear he had on. I don’t think they were Zara Kids, but they were his, the ones he is wearing as the statue.\n\nD: How has it been working in CDMX? Did you come to CDMX to work?\n\nS: Originally I came here to do an exhibition. I planned this exhibition with a gallery, and I was going to do the work here. We would have been exhibiting around now, actually, around June. But it didn’t happen, because the gallerist, and I’m not sure what happened, but he just stopped returning my calls, messages, emails, and I just..\n\nD: You got ghosted.\n\nS: Yeah! He ghosted me. I didn’t come here for that show only, but that was potentially the main reason, was to make the work here, and to have this exhibition.\n\nD: Wow, I’m really sorry.\n\nS: It’s totally fine. It turns out I am kind of glad that I didn’t do it because I already feel as though the work that I was going to make was very much focused on a romantic situation, an ex-boyfriend. I was going to recontextualize the relationship and make a whole body of work around it. Later I realized I already did that with a previous project, so why do that again and why was I revisiting it? Even though it didn’t happen, and that’s a shame, it’s better because it made me move further on with my work and with other projects. I’ve been working on other projects here. I have an exhibition which I curated here and is in Los Angeles. I did most of the curation work here, and I’ve been working on two new commissions as well. So, I have been working plenty, but of course, I have been trying to explore the city, meet people, and I’ve been trying to learn Spanish. It’s funny, a couple of people back in Los Angeles, where I am based, were saying, ‘ Oh I would love to go to Mexico for four months, six months.’ I have to remind people, I’m not here for a vacation, I’m here to work. I wish I were on holiday for four or six months, that would be something special, but no, I am happy here, happy to be working. The new commission, it’s a new selfie statue with a guy called Sean Ford. He is an adult entertainer, and this commission came from a big collector of mine in London. We did the 3D scanning for the sculpture here. He was in Mexico City for a party, and so I brought my 3D scanning guy and got it done here.\n\nD: The next question was going to be why Mexico City, but that kind of answered it.\n\nS: It was the exhibition, but also, living in Los Angeles, it’s very, you know, it’s the only major American city that isn’t white Anglo-Saxon influenced. It is Latin American, it is South American. It has a very different energy and a very different vibe. When I started meeting people in LA, I started making friends with a lot of Mexican-Americans and some from South America, or other parts of Latin America. It piqued my interest in coming to Mexico and exploring. So that was another reason to come here. Growing up in England, I never had any exposure to Latin American culture or Mexican culture, so for me, to come and explore that, to think about it and to educate myself, was another reason for coming.\n\nD: So far, what’s been the most inspirational part of your stay?\n\nS: I think it’s just the people. The people that I’m meeting and the energy in this city is something special. The art, like the fine art scene and the art scene here, seems to be really, really, really, something special right now. The energy here for that is an inspiration. You know when you’re in a space, and you have to create in a vacuum? When you’re surrounded by lots of other creative energies, it can be tough because you’re battling against your own desire to create. You are fighting this vacuum of known creativity. But here, it doesn’t seem to feel that way. It feels as though there is *snapping* something happening. I mean that’s what you have when you have a city of what, 21 million people? It is constantly *snaps* like this *snaps*\n\nD: As a foreigner, how do you see the LGBTQI+ community in Mexico?\n\nS: Thriving and vibrant. Before I came here, I knew this group of guys who did this party, Traición. I met them in LA, so I knew that that was happening here. It’s extremely vibrant. And then my roommate, he takes part in the Vogue Balls, and I went to a couple, they were great. It has this underground energy. Obviously you can go to Zona Rosa and see the same old stuff that you can find in any place, but still, it has this underground spirit, like the Traición party, and like Pervert.\n\nD: Is there something else that you want to add?\n\nS: I mean, this was a pleasure, and thank you very much, I have had a wonderful time here.\n\nD: Well, thank you for this opportunity and for giving me a little bit of your time. I never thought I would interview you.\n\nS: That is actually really flattering.\n\nD: I think I saw your first stuff on Facebook or something like that. I thought it was so cool because I used to love Sebastian, as you know he was on all the covers, and then he posted some of your work. At first, I thought he was selling his own series until I checked further and discovered you.\n\nS: Actually, one thing that we might be doing is because he said to me, ‘oh we need to make the big one.’ Because the whole plan was to do an 8-foot version, that was the plan from the start. He wrote to me a month or so ago, and he was saying well, we need to finally do it. He said, ‘Let’s try to raise some money through crowdfunding or Kickstarter so that we have the money to do it.’ He told me that if we reach a certain goal, ‘I’ll do a nude version of it,’ and I thought to myself, that would be pretty great. So maybe that will happen at some point. For me, it’s not important that I do a nude version because the reason I had him wearing the briefs was to make the image about a very specific point in time. I wanted this statue to show that we are way less open to nudity, male nudity, than the Greeks or the Romans, were. But we will see, maybe it will happen, perhaps it won’t.\n\n© 2019 Dano Santana/The Guest Magazine\n\nI had a serious wanking-in-public phase some ten years ago. Now, bringing this back-to- mind I have to ask myself, why on earth did I, a shy blue-eyed angel-boy, risk my ‘good kid’ opinion just to get a shot of adrenaline in my head supplemented by a shot of spunk from my cock? No, it wasn’t for Art. I wish it was. It was because sex in public is, and always will be (until the very end of this prudish, straightlaced and sad world), a human being’s natural need. From natural need develops social phenomenon. And from social phenomenon develops a desire to symbolically represent this reality – in other words, a twisted mind’s creative urge some call art.\n\nFirst an elucidation on why Stuart Sandford’s recent work, documenting gay cruising grounds in Europe, and his image for the Bloc Billboard are particularly significant. His photos often border on the public-private debate; he edges the subject, crosses the line, makes the spectator confused. It is a matter of his art’s base and super-structure. Such is the case with the ‘Venice’ billboard. Its significance reaches out beyond his previous works, which have explored the male body, or rather a cultural projection of it. This time the body is gone. The usual object of mapping is no longer there. Background becomes Object. It’s a shift from portrait to landscape. But all the same, there is Stuart’s trademark double meaning. This Venice cruising area, looking like any place, anywhere, receives its base and super-structure. The base is very plain. Just bushes one may say, mere sand, no big deal. But the super-structure is what really smacks you. The bushes and the sand become something close to institution after comprehending all of the following:\n\nThere should be men there doing their nasty pleasures, seeking a trade, becoming a trade, performing either the act of devoted desperation or simple fellatio. But we’re not going to get that. Neither in this billboard nor in Stuart’s series of landscape photos and videos probing the same subject. This is the moment when the story becomes unreservedly sad. It is close to the moment we get from the snapshot images of Dean Sameshima who made a series of photographs of sex places in Los Angeles[i] . Dowdy buildings on dowdy streets. Padlocked doors. Cabin 2768 closed in 1995. The sun pouring down like it’s five minutes to Armageddon on Hollywood Boulevard. Nostalgia is a common element of both Sameshima and Sandford’s art. Nostalgia is the feeling penetrating the mind, fingering the brain, rimming that hole in a continuum of time whilst looking at those photos. For these are the places where men hunted for love. Not just for trolling[ii]; neither a casual blow-job nor coital intercourse with a married cab driver. Bungee-jumpers without the bungee. Cruising areas were always sovereign space for the queer. Also, a state of mind so sensitively described in one of Justin Chin’s poems:\n\nLick my butt, I will lick yours then.\n\nWe will take care of the world’s shit later[iii].\n\nBut are we actually considering a real social phenomenon or rather an overconfident or even cock-sure judgment? I believe the proof lies somewhere there in Berlin’s Tiergarten, where in the 30’s SA thugs bunked-up before having to send the rest of the cruisers to Dachau just a few years later; they are now scattered on the streets of Eastern Europe where forbidden pleasures used to be cultivated in war-time-ghettos, in a true anus mundi. Or perhaps today, in Queens New York, where lucky hipsters may blow to their sheer\n\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼disbelief a closeted Hassid. Cruising areas were the setting of classless and raceless activities of bum bandits, the unconscious revolutionaries of arse.\n\nImagine it’s 1952, you’re a well off WASP, living with your unaware wife and children in an Edwardian house, you pretend to enjoy your life and believe you really like the new Queen, but at heart you just crave for fucking men. What do you do? You cruise. You cottage. You gag for it with any stranger who just wants to get his knees dirty. Never underestimate the capacity of sex for social-change. Remember Pasolini’s Teorema[iv] ? If that’s not a phenomenon then what is it?\n\nStuart’s Venice beach, a place where one could once get a blow-job, suntan and sunstroke at the same time is now abandoned. There’s no one left there. And I don’t mean the actual absence of men on the billboard. The institution of public sex-place is withering. The queer of today have joyfully deserted spots like this, instead choosing dating websites, naively trusting they are now civilized. Not quite. In this particular sense Stuart’s frequently voyeuristic art becomes more in the manner of an archivist.\n\nMost gay men now prefer to select and to be selected. They publicise themselves and their cocks like in some sort of advert. Many queers are now logged on dating websites harshly demolishing the frolicking pleasure of getting fucked in a local park. Now it’s just teens and twinks. Oldies and daddies. Muscle and leather. Categories. Sorts. Classes. Men voluntarily put themselves into groups of membership users like they have become products in the local ASDA.\n\nThis billboard however possesses a culture jamming factor. But I’m not going to write about the Billboard Liberation Front[v] because Stuart’s piece is not really about that. There is a certain reference though within his Bloc project heading in that direction. Culture jamming has been characterized as a form of public activism, generally in opposition to commercialism and the vectors of corporate image. This is one of the crucial shifts in the “shag me in the bushes movement” and of what has happened to it in recent years. It has become part of a corporate image. Today there is always someone getting his share from a human being willing to fuck. And I don’t mean a threesome. One pays. One may log in. One may browse.\n\nI’m sure Stuart is utterly happy showing you a billboard that sells nothing. Just nostalgia. At least that’s what comes for free. His work is just like looking back in time. Like re- visiting the house you were born in all those years ago. It looks the same but there’s something different. Something is lost.\n\nNOTES\n\n[i]Dean Sameshima, Wonderland, 1996/97\n\n[ii] There are a number of Polari used in this text. Polari was a form of cant slang used in the gay subculture in Britain where it was used to disguise homosexual activity from potentially hostile outsiders. There is some debate about how it originated. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polari\n\n[iii] Justin Chin, Bite Hard (Manic D Press), 1997\n\n[iv]Pier Paolo Pasolini, Theorem (Teorema), 1968. Terence Stamp plays a mysterious figure who appears in the lives of a typical bourgeois Italian family. He engages in sexual ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼affairs with all members of the household: the devoutly religious maid, the sensitive son, the sexually repressed mother, the timid daughter and, finally, the tormented father. The stranger gives unstintingly of himself, asking nothing in return. Then one day he leaves, as suddenly and mysteriously as he came. Unable to endure the void in their lives, the mother becomes a nymphomaniac, the son an artist, the daughter a catatonic and the father a sexual prowler. The servant, on the other hand, appears in the last scene casually performing a miracle. On its release, the religious right and the Vatican criticized the film’s sexual content. The Left considered it “ambiguous” and “visionary”.\n\n[v]The Billboard Liberation Front is a group of “culture jammers” devoted to ‘improving’ billboards by changing key words to radically alter the message, often to an anti- corporate message.\n\n© 2008 Lukasz M.
