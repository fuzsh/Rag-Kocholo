        "text": "New Norse Studies, edited by Jeffrey Turco, gathers twelve original essays engaging aspects of Old Norse–Icelandic literature that continue to kindle the scholarly imagination in the twenty-first century. The assembled authors examine the arrière-scène of saga literature; the nexus of skaldic poetry and saga narrative; medieval and post-medieval gender roles; and other manifestations of language, time, and place as preserved in Old Norse–Icelandic texts. This volume will be welcomed not only by the specialist and by scholars in adjacent fields but also by the avid general reader, drawn in ever-increasing number to the Icelandic sagas and their world. Table of Contents Preface; Jeffrey Turco, volume editor: Introduction; Andy Orchard: Hereward and Grettir: Brothers from Another Mother?; Richard L. Harris: “Jafnan segir inn ríkri ráð”: Proverbial Allusion and the Implied Proverb in Fóstbrœðra saga; Torfi H. Tulinius: Seeking Death in Njáls saga; Guðrún Nordal: Skaldic Poetics and the Making of the Sagas of Icelanders; Russell Poole: Identity Poetics among the Icelandic Skalds; Jeffrey Turco: Loki, Sneglu-Halla þáttr, and the Case for a Skaldic Prosaics; Thomas D. Hill: Beer, Vomit, Blood and Poetry: Egils saga, Chapters 44-45; Shaun F. D. Hughes: The Old Norse Exempla as Arbiters of Gender Roles in Medieval Iceland; Paul Acker: Performing Gender in the Icelandic Ballads; Joseph Harris: The Rök Inscription, Line 20; Sarah Harlan-Haughey: A Landscape of Conflict: Three Stories of the Faroe Conversions; Kirsten Wolf: Non-Basic Color Terms in Old Norse-Icelandic\n\nThis article proposes that the oft-dismissed Sneglu-Halla þáttr (Tale of Sarcastic Halli) is not simply a series of virtuoso vituperations peppered with sexual-cum-barnyard humor, nor “a series of episodes that could have been arranged otherwise as well,” but a text that repays close attention, both for original audiences as well as for scholars of Old Norse-Icelandic literature. I argue that its eponymous hero establishes his social position at the royal Norwegian court by ensconcing himself within a sustained series of allusions to myths of the Norse god Loki, while framing his peers, and even his superiors, as the sexual deviants, low-lifes, and numbskulls of a déclassé “folktale” world. Sneglu-Halla þáttr thus presupposes considerable literary connoisseurship, detailed knowledge of the Norse mythographic tradition, and a consciousness of high and low genre that reflects concerns of shifting social classes and political powers in thirteenth and fourteenth-century Iceland. Ultimately, I leverage this reading to articulate a reappraisal of medieval Icelandic narrative prose—most often lauded for its “realism,\" \"straightforwardness,\" and \"objectivity”: I offer that this deceptively “simple” tale adheres to the same aesthetic principles of complexity, ambiguity, and allusiveness that characterize the Skaldic poetry that is its ostensible subject.\n\nIn this dissertation, I intend to draw out and describe the queer themes within the literature of Old Norse mythology using a queer theoretical framework to examine textual sources. I will examine the Poetic Edda, Prose Edda, Gesta Danorum, Heimskringla and some of the Icelandic Sagas as well as Grágás law code texts for comparison of themes. Using queer theory I will provide a re-interpretation of themes, characters and relationships within specific examples from these texts and demonstrate the “queerness” therein. Queer theory provides a means of refuting the cis-heteropatriarchal framework through which much of Old Norse literature is analysed and therefore works to prevent the erasure of queer individuals from historical sources. With this approach I am able to demonstrate distinct themes of queerness which relate to transformation of bodies through magic and shapeshifting, queer relationships and suppression of queerness by medieval Christian practices and the use of cross-dressing to embody non-normative roles and different gender expression. The queerness of individuals in the literature is characterised in Óðinn and Loki’s movement through gender, the relative acceptance of their defiance of norms and the actions they take. This is also seen for mortal characters in Old Norse mythology albeit with lesser acceptance by their peers and more risk in view of the Grágás law codes. These themes speak to the evident queerness in Old Norse myth and also point towards the possibility of a greater understanding and acceptance of the fluid nature of gender and sexuality in the Viking Age.\n\nThis article is a study of AM 152 fol., an early-sixteenth-century vellum manuscript. One of its scribes was Þorsteinn Þorleifsson, the brother of the rich and powerful Björn Þorleifsson in Reykhólar in Northwest Iceland. I argue that Björn was the manuscrip’s patron and may have been involved in the selection of texts. The sagas in the codex are a varied collection of family sagas, legendary sagas and romances; despite the sagas’ disparate settings, they have many themes in common. By analysing these sagas, we can recover certain historical attitudes regarding moral values and social behaviour, and they speak to the patron’s (and perhaps his associates’) self-image and ideology or mentality. The sagas of AM 152 fol. are often narratives about young upper-class men and their development into responsible adults who behave according to certain norms and moral values. A heavy emphasis is placed on fraternal bonds and remaining loyal and supportive to one’s brother despite his possible deficiencies. The heroes’ (and their brothers’) antagonists are usually immoral, ill-tempered and deceitful men who are characterised by a lack of moderation, prudence, and justice. I argue that such narratives would have been appealing to Björn and his brother Þorsteinn, who were involved in a long-standing inheritance dispute with their cousin Björn Guðnason, who may have embodied the same kinds of qualities as the sagas’ villains. Second, another frequent theme in the sagas is monstrosity and especially its connections to violence against women. Monstrous figures are marginalised and othered, but when examined more closely, the saga heroes often have monstrous physical features and engage in the same behaviour as these characters. Their violence against women is usually displayed in a comic light or otherwise suppressed and dismissed but there is a great deal of overlap in the natures of humans and monsters, suggesting certain vulnerabilities when it comes to social conduct. The latter could be contextualised with fears regarding the presence of foreign merchants and fishermen in Iceland in the late medieval period, but they could just as well be a vehicle to discuss such behaviour in the audience’s own community."
