The two main political parties right now are using trans rights as political pawns ♟️(this comes as no surprise to the community). However specifically the Tories, if kept in power, can create so much damage by changing the Equality Act and protections against the trans community, including the legal definition of biological sex and access to single sex spaces 🤯 Doing so will make it nearly impossible for trans people to exist safely in society 😭 The problem here is this uneducated fear mongering & hate speech (from both sides) will speak to uneducated voters looking for an enemy and there is a genuine possibility they can stay in power 😩 Trans people are NOT the enemy, but instead an extremely vulnerable part of society that make up less than 1% of the population 🌍 We are not up for discussion. Our lives matter and we are human beings just trying to get on with our sh*t. It genuinely makes me sick to my stomach that I pay takes and contribute to an economy in a country run by politicians that argue the validity of my existence & are trying to take away my rights 🔗 So educate yourselves, your loved ones and your colleagues that trans people just want to be loved and trans kids deserve to grow up 🏳️⚧️ And sign up here to get rid of the tories, with free stragic voting advice in your area : https://lnkd.in/dNnbbqbP ⚡️ Thea xoxo #translivesmatter #transisbeautiful #lgbtq #pridemonth #toriesout\n\nHere are the directions issued by the Hon'ble CJI in the Same-Sex Marriage Case. -The Union and State Governments along with the governments of UTs are directed to: i. Make sure there is no discrimination towards queer community. Ii. Make sure that the queer community is not being discriminated against while accessing goods and services which are available to everyone else. iii. To make efforts toward sensitisation of the public about queer identity. iv. Create hotline numbers for the queer community in case of violence or harassment. v. Establish shelter houses for the queer community facing discrimination or violence. vi. Make sure that treatments which aim to change gender of persons are ceased with immediate effect. vii. Make sure that inter-sex children are not forced to undergo operations for their sex. Take extra care if they are incompetent for a valid consent. viii. Make sure no person is forced to undergo hormonal therapy etc. Also recognize the self-identified gender of all persons. #samesexmarriage #supremecourt #india #gender #directions #government\n\nNo one left behind: equality, freedom and justice for all! Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT). With equality, freedom and justice in mind, we want to bring attention to the recently announced review of Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) in the UK. Following years of targeted anti-trans sentiment, the proposed RSHE guidance states simply that \"gender identity should not be taught\". Pushing trans and nonbinary people from the public eye doesn't change the reality that we exist. Children should not be brought up with a narrow and unrealistic understanding of human diversity, leaving them woefully unprepared for a naturally diverse world. Simply not teaching about gender will not prevent kids from being trans and non-binary, but it will teach those kids to live in enforced silence and shame. We are still feeling the repercussions of Section 28. A repeat of that injustice is being threatened again, now. The gov review of the RSHE statutory guidance consultation is open now and closes 11:59pm on 11 July 2024. Please fill it out - let's oppose the utter inadequacy of this proposed guidance, together (link in our bio). Not one child or young person should be left behind. Equality, freedom, and justice for ALL! #Proud2Be #Trans #Nonbinary #Gay #Bi #IDAHOBIT #IDAHOBIT2024 #LGBT #LGBTQ #LGBTQIA\n\nKey facts: 62 countries have laws that criminalize private, consensual, same-sex sexual activity, mainly for men. Almost half of them are Commonwealth jurisdictions. 12 of them have jurisdictions in which the death penalty is imposed or at least a possibility for private, consensual same-sex sexual activity. At least 6 of these implement the death penalty. 14 countries criminalize the gender identity and expression of transgender people. In many more countries, transgender people are targeted by a range of laws that criminalize same-sex activity and vagrancy, hooliganism, and public order offenses. It is important to note that legality of same-sex sexual acts cannot be read as evidence of a safer living environment for people with diverse sexual orientations or gender identities or expressions. In many of the States where consensual same-sex sexual acts are legal, the social stigmatization of people who are perceived as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender remains alarmingly high.

May 17 was chosen to commemorate the World Health Organization's decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder, in 1990. It is currently celebrated in more than 130 countries, including 37 where same-sex acts are illegal. This year's theme is \"No One Left Behind: Equality, Freedom and Justice for All\". The world has just celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – a document that is much more than a cornerstone of international law: It is a guide to navigate the deeply divided world, a set of values that everyone can live by and ultimately a force of good. And yet, we know that \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\" represents a promise not yet fulfilled – for 2SLGBTQ2+ people across the world and for everyone experiencing the suffocating impact on their lives of diverse layers of inequalities. This year's IDAHBT theme is a call for unity: Only through solidarity for each other will we create a world without injustice, where no one is left behind.” ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍🩷🩵 #InternationalDayAgainstHomophobiaAndTransphobia #ForeverProud #ForeverProgressing #2SLGBTQ #Equality #Freedom #Justice #IDAHBT\n\nYour beliefs shouldn't take away from the freedom of others. \"Seriously, is freedom the core principle of everything in this country? Yes or no? You know what that means? That means your personal beliefs do not get to take away other people's freedoms. If you're sitting in this room right now, and you're somebody who thinks I don't, there are people who do this, who thinks I don't think LGBT, any of the letters should exist. Everybody should be heterosexual. How many agree there are people in this country who believe that yes or no? Okay. That's, Hey, you could choose to believe that. That's very different than saying you all have to believe it because I do. Okay. That's not freedom anymore. How many of these are a huge difference when you start sitting in this room thinking, because of what I've been taught, what I believe, everybody must believe this, if you agree with me, that's dangerous to just say dangerous.\" 👉 Learn more at https://lnkd.in/gntE7Q4Q #CenterForRespect #MikeDomitrz #Culture #Respect\n\nHugely important step forward for the LGBTQ+ community in Hong Kong with this Court of Final Appeal decision that the failure of the government to provide alternative means of recognising same-sex partnerships is a violation of the constitutional right to privacy. Progress towards equity and equality for same sex partnerships has so far been driven by our fantastic courts and the tireless efforts of brave and dedicated advocates. **** “By a majority, as indicated in paragraph 214 above and as provided below, subject to receiving written submissions from the parties (whereupon the following Declaration and accompanying Direction may be modified or confirmed) [the Court]: (i) Declares that, the Government is in violation of its positive obligation under Article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships (such as registered civil partnerships or civil unions) and to provide for appropriate rights and obligations attendant on such recognition with a view to ensuring effective compliance with the aforesaid obligation. (ii) Directs that operation of the abovementioned Declaration be suspended for a period of two years from the date of the final Order to be made after receipt of the parties’ written submissions, to afford the Government time to comply with its aforesaid obligation.” **** Now for our Government to create the legislative framework. #lgbtqrights #hongkong #progress\n\nBig tech is exploiting the LGBTQIA+ community to avoid regulations, causing serious damage. Companies claim they are attempting to make their platforms safer. Still, evidence suggests their hyper-targeted algorithmic processes increase users' vulnerability to mental health issues like anxiety, despair, eating disorders, and suicide ideation. Among LGBTQIA+ adolescents, 24% were more likely than non-LGBTQIA+ youth to be recommended dieting or pro-eating disorder content whenever they used the platform. 56% of LGBTQIA+ kids and 32% of non-LGBTQIA+ youth reported experiencing cyberbullying at some point. These businesses aren't driven to improve; they're rewarded for keeping the issue under wraps. Instagram's pro-eating disorder material generates about $230 million in revenue annually. The Kids Online Safety Act would force Big Tech to stop engaging in unethical commercial activities.
