        "text": "This chapter offers an introduction to the central themes, concepts and debates in queer theory. It explores three trajectories that queer studies has taken. First, it investigates the necessity of, and possibilities for, decolonising queer studies, focusing in particular on translation, conceptual innovation and alternative genealogies as decolonising strategies. Second, it illuminates a tradition of materialist analysis in queer studies while also demonstrating how the relationship between queer communities and capitalism is historically contingent and shifting. Third, it scales up concerns with race and class to the international level, demonstrating how queer politics matters to global politics. Not only are queer lives shaped by international structures and processes; these international dynamics might themselves be queer, haunted as they are by figurations of normality and perversion.\n\nIn the last few decades, much of queer theory and sexuality studies has been engaged in analyzing and resisting the – often partial and exclusionary – assimilation of queer subjects into the cultural and economic fabric of the nation-state. As illiberal anti-gender rhetoric and politics (re)surface across Europe, it might seem as though queer theory ought to reconsider its critiques of queer liberalism and homonationalism – in the face of neo-fascist threats and LGBT-free zones, recourse to liberal ideals of human rights and national acceptance may assume increasing credibility and even urgency. But can anti-gender politics really be so neatly opposed to “progressive” values of gender equality and gay rights, as supposedly modeled by Nordic countries? This article seeks to complicate this apparent opposition between anti-gender politics and homonationalist rhetoric by tracing the racist and nationalist tendencies that transverse both projects. I argue that not only does the homonati...\n\nIn theorising \"gay rights as human rights\", International Political Theory necessarily engages a fraught terrain: the real world politics of rights for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans* and queer people is deeply contested. While now recognised by the UN and leading democratic states (if still incompletely and often haphazardly), LGBTQ 1 rights are denied in many other quarters. Empirical research in global sexuality politics demonstrates the value of human rights in securing protections for LGBTQ people; at the same time, it highlights the ambiguities associated with the universalizing claims of this rights politics. In this chapter, I discuss how the use of LGBTQ rights claims highlights the need for critical theoretical approaches to human rights. These approaches consider the practice of human rights-specifically here of LGBTQ rights-in the context of real world politics. Theorists are required to go beyond normative and abstract claims, such as the one made famous by Hilary Clinton at the UN, that \"gay rights are human rights\"; they are also required to consider the politicized and sometimes antithetical use to which such claims are put in the foreign policies of states and the behaviour of other international actors. The practice of gay rights by states and other agents, like the practice of other human rights, can be caught up in a politics which undermines the emancipatory impetus of the initial social movement.\n\nIn light of the recent attention to the incarceration, surveillance, and policing of non-normative people in the Middle East and North Africa, this article does not seek to offer alternatives to systems of justice. Instead, our argument revolves around the need to turn the concept of justice on its head, by demonstrating that justice within the context of the nation-state is in its essence a de facto and de jure mechanism of policing and surveillance. To do so, this article draws on Michael Foucault's notion of state-phobia from a de-colonial perspective, intersectional feminist theory, and Hisham Sharabi's conceptualisation of the Arab-state as neo-patriarchal. This article highlights the need to move away from the post-colonial benevolent imaginary of the state, as a result of people's desire for self-determination, to a more realistic de-colonial conceptualisation of nation-states that emerged post-colonisation, as sites of oppression. This article will also shed light on the role of civil society in reinforcing the unjust justice sought within nation-state frameworks by drawing on the examples of the recent crackdown on non-normative people in Egypt, and the example of non-normative Palestinians living under occupation. The Egyptian and Palestinian cases are, respectively, one of an allegedly sovereign state that overtly restricts gender and sexual freedom, and another of an occupying state that nominally guarantees gender and sexual rights. These examples are used to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings of this article, through which we seek to problematise and break binaries of justice versus injustice, and the state versus civil society, in an attempt to queer the concept of justice."
