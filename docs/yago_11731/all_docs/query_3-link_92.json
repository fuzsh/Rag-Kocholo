        "text": "I just got \"Mad Monster Party\" off the shelf to watch when I saw this. Sad news and hope the family are doing ok. I don't know much about Mr. Rankin but I do like all his work that I am aware of. Frosty and Rudolph help with the Christmas cheer here every year and have been enjoyed for many years.\n\namong a million other projects, he and Jules Bass did the 1977 hobbit animated feature, not to mention the late 80s thundercats and silverhawks series.\n\nalso, as far as their stop-motion animation holiday films go, the year without a santa claus rules. I more or less aspired to be Heat Miser when I was five.\n\nLooks like drasil beat me to the punch on the non-holiday specials, and I agree that The Year Without A Santa Claus was one of their best (that bit with Mother Nature telling off the Heat Miser and Snow Miser is my personal favorite). Interesting how the Rankin-Bass cartoon version of The Hobbit was generally considered cheesy but has been more enjoyable over time for me than the recent movies. I also loved The Thundercats (\"Feel the magic, hear the roar!\").\n\nAmazing how many of us still watch these long after childhood, which I think speaks to their quality. RIP"
