        "text": "Arthur Rankin Jr., 89, whose\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nremains television's longest-running Christmas special, died of natural causes last Thursday in Bermuda, where he had retired.\n\n\"Arthur was the Walt Disney of stop-motion animation,\" said Rick Goldschmidt, who chronicled the history of Rankin-Bass productions in books and a website. \"He was a great influence on the Tim Burton films and even more so on Pixar.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Rankin and partner Jules Bass also produced traditional, hand-drawn animation, their studio was best known for its stop-motion technique called Animagic, which differed from clay motion in its use of small, wire-jointed dolls.\n\nBurton, who told the Los Angeles Times last year that he had \"a fond burning feeling\" for the Rankin-Bass holiday specials he watched as a child, created movies such as Nightmare Before Christmas using the same style of jointed figurines.\n\nOther Rankin-Bass stop-motion works include The Little Drummer Boy (1968), Santa Claus Is Coming to Town (1970), Here Comes Peter Cottontail (1971), and The Year Without a Santa Claus (1974).\n\n\"In all our pictures we had an antagonist who becomes the good guy,\" Mr. Rankin said in a 2005 interview for the Archive of American Television, \"and the underdog fulfills his quest.\"\n\n1964's Rudolph took more than a year to make because of the painstakingly slow pace of stop-motion production, \"but the show is not just the technique,\" Mr. Rankin told the Washington Post in 2004. \"It's the story, the characters, the music. We knew what we needed: warmth. Rudolph showed us that.\"\n\nMr. Rankin, the son of vaudevillians, was hired as a graphic designer and art director for ABC television after serving in the Navy in World War II.\n\nIn the late 1950s he went to Japan to study the techniques of stop-motion animator Tad Mochinaga, who used figurines and miniature sets to make his films. Mochinaga would later supervise the animation of a number of Rankin-Bass shows.\n\nJohnny Marks, who wrote the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" was afraid that his hit could be tarnished if the TV project was a flop, but when it aired on a Sunday afternoon before Christmas, the ratings vanquished any fears of failure."
