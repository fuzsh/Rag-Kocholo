        "text": "My assumption is that, as a theatrical film, this had a bigger budget than all the Rankin/Bass TV holiday classics we all know and love. Sadly, it really doesn't show in the final product, other than in its all-star cast. It's pretty rough going at times and I think a couple of rethinks could have improved it tremendously. For one, the hybrid of live-action and animation doesn't work so well. It's mentioned in the commentary on the Blu-Ray that the producer was aiming for another ùôàùôñùôßùôÆ ùôãùô§ùô•ùô•ùôûùô£ùô® and was highly dissatisfied with what he got, which makes sense since this is a turd sandwich next to that film. The transitions between live-action and animated are hardly seamless, in fact, they‚Ä¶\n\nThere are wonderful moments in here. The character design, as in every Rankin Bass stop motion production, is spectacular, a nice mix of fairy tale aesthetic and celebrity caricature. Same with the production and costume, the live action sequences feel like the village out of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, colourful and fun. But this is also really long, covering three Hans Christian Andersen stories as well as a framing narrative.\n\nThe biggest problem might be that it starts off with the best story, a devastating spin on The Little Mermaid, and goes downhill from there. Or that Chris, our main character, acts like such an ass in that story that it's really hard to root for him from then on.‚Ä¶"
