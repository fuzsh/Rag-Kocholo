        "text": "The Daydreamer is a 1966 stop-motion animated/live-action musical fantasy film produced by Videocraft International (a.k.a. Rankin/Bass Productions). Directed by Jules Bass, it was written by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Romeo Muller and is based on the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. It features seven original songs by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. The live action sequences were filmed at the New York World’s Fair, while the “Animagic” puppet sequences were staged by Don Duga at Videocraft in New York. Among the cast were the American actors, Paul O’Keefe, Jack Gilford, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton (both from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz), and the Australian actor Cyril Ritchard; who also made his voice appearance in three of their other animated productions: The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye: The Emperor’s New Clothes in 1972, The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow in 1975, and The Hobbit in 1977 (his final film role shortly before his death).\n\nThe film was Videocraft’s first theatrical feature production to be distributed by Embassy Pictures, located in Los Angeles, California and headed by the executive producer Joseph E. Levine. Embassy Pictures later theatrically released the company’s two other films in 1967, Mad Monster Party and The Wacky World of Mother Goose.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn the village of Odense, Denmark, a teenaged Hans Christian Andersen, commonly known in this film as Chris, lives with his father, a poor but honest shoemaker. After returning home from fishing by the river, Chris witnesses his father being treated poorly by Mrs. Klopplebobbler, a frequent and grouchy customer who insists that her shoes be done immediately. Papa Andersen wants a better life for his son and as such stresses education, coaching Chris to study hard. He tells Chris of a place called the Garden of Paradise, where flowers are the candy of knowledge. Later that night, Chris is visited by the Sandman, who comes and tells him that the Garden of Paradise is very much real. Chris, who’s bored with studying and would much rather obtain knowledge from the Garden’s many flowers, asks the Sandman to show him the way, then runs away from home.\n\nThe next morning, Chris takes a boat ride and falls asleep, beginning to daydream. A terrible storm tears Chris’ boat apart and he drowns beneath the ocean. He is rescued by the Little Mermaid, who takes him to her sisters and her father, Father Neptune. Her father explains to her that Chris has drowned. Her sisters tell her that the Sea Witch possesses a magic potion that can revive drowned humans. She goes to the Sea Witch’s lair and for help and bargains with the witch for the magic potion. She tells the mermaid that she will grant her the potion, but under the condition that if Chris fails to accept her love, then she will become an outcast both land and sea. She agrees, believing that Chris will love her and stay. After reviving Chris, the two spend some time enjoying the sea, until Chris tells her he was on his way to the Garden of Paradise when she found him. The mermaid wishes to accompany Chris on his journey, but when they breach the ocean surface to look for the shore, Chris tells her that he plans to go alone and bids her goodbye, leaving her behind on the rock in tears.\n\nChris awakens from his daydream and finds an ugly duckling left behind by his family. He decides to take the little duckling along with him. Meanwhile, Papa Andersen finds Chris’ note and discovers he ran away. He rushes out of the house and sets out to find Chris, only to end up stranded on a small island in the middle of the river. Elsewhere along the river, Chris begins to daydream again as his boat drifts off. When he awakens, he meets up with two tailors named Zebro Zenith and Zachary Zilch. Unaware that they are really con artists, they tell Chris that they know the way to the Garden of Paradise, and they will take him there if he assists them with an important task. They make their way to the palace and meet his majesty the Emperor, who is very dissatisfied with his wardrobe. They tell him that their garments are “invisible to witless dullards, but not to those with exquisite tastes.” Of course, no one will admit to not seeing the material after a statement like that, especially the Emperor. The tricky tailors get a big advance of money, gold and silver threads, and silks. They begin to work on the Emperor’s new wardrobe, but Chris says he cannot see it. They tell him that it is invisible to fools and fools are not allowed in the Garden of Paradise to keep him quiet, out of fear that their ruse will be exposed. The next day, the Emperor leads a grand procession, presenting his “new clothes” to his subjects. However, one little boy in the crowd notices that the Emperor is really naked, and soon the crowd notices this too. The tailors abandon Chris and flee from the angry townsfolk, leaving Chris behind to flee himself.\n\nBack in reality, Chris is awakened and greeted by Big Claus, the mean-spirited game warden, who falsely arrests Chris for poaching, as he believes Chris is the person who has been poaching ducks (since the boy has the ugly duckling with him). He sentences the boy to work chopping wood. Meanwhile, Papa Andersen is still out looking for Chris and finds his boat. Using it to escape the island, he soon ends up falling into the river and swimming to the shore. He finds a fish in his pocket, and is caught by Big Claus, falsely arresting Papa Andersen for presumably fishing in protected waters. Chris, in the meantime, daydreams again. This time, he meets Thumbelina, a tiny girl no bigger than a thumb. She offers him a tulip seed, which eats and ends up shrinking down to her size. The two build a boat out of a walnut shell and sail down the river, when a huge, mean and ugly frog disrupts their path momentarily. They narrowly escape and make their way to a waterfall, where upon their trip up the river ends at a small burrow as it starts to snow.\n\nKnocking at the door, the children are greeted by a Rat. The Rat shows them great hospitality, giving them hot cheese tea, letting them warm themselves in front his fireplace, and giving them a nice place to sleep. Later that night, Chris overhears the Rat talking his friend, a Mole. He tells the Mole that he plans to offer Thumbelina to him as his bride and he himself plans to make Chris his personal slave. The next morning, the children play along as they pay a visit to the Mole’s home, as the Rat sends them off to pick up “medicine for his bad back.” As they enter the Mole’s home, they discover a dying sparrow. Thumbelina shows great compassion for the bird, but Chris shows very little concern for him. Inside the Mole’s home, which is quite dingy and crawling with bugs and bats, they receive bag from the Mole. Unbeknownst to them, the bag doesn’t hold medicine for the Rat’s back, but instead holds the payment for Thumbelina. Later that day, the Rat has his brainless slave guard the children while he goes out, but he falls asleep instead. Thumbelina sneaks out and brings the sparrow a warm blanket. When she returns, she tells Chris that the sparrow is alive and will take them to the Garden of the Little People. Chris tells her in response that he’d never amount to anything in the real world being the size of a thumb. Thumbelina tells him that “size has nothing to do with happiness,” but he doesn’t listen to reason as he only cares about himself. He leaves his friend and sails down the river in their walnut shell boat, only to encounter the frog again, whom he manages to elude by hiding in a tulip.\n\nChris wonders aloud why he can’t reach the Garden, to which the Sandman appears and tells him it’s because he deserted his friends and lied for his own ambitions, to which Chris tells him that he never meant to do so. He begs the Sandman to grant him one last chance, to which he graciously grants and leads Chris straight to the Garden. There, he warns the boy that if he wishes to stay in the Garden, he must not fall prey to temptation and the eat the flowers of knowledge. If he does, then he’ll be lost forever in the land of nothingness. Chris promises he’ll never eat the flowers and the Sandman leaves him to enjoy the wonders of the Garden. Shortly afterwards, Chris meets a devil boy named Puck who goads him into trying the forbidden flowers from the Tree of Knowledge. Chris foolishly gives in, and as a result, the world around him explodes in a very traumatic sequence. Chris finally awakens from the nightmare to find game warden with Papa Andersen, who is finally reunited with his son. He gives the game warden his wife’s ring to pay their fines, and they are released from their labors.\n\nPapa Andersen gets Chris to hit the books again. Years later, his dreams become the basis for his famous fairy tales, which he writes as an adult: “The Little Mermaid,” “The Ugly Duckling,” “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” “Little Claus and Big Claus,” “Thumbelina,” and “The Garden of Paradise.”\n\nSongs[]\n\n“Daydreamer”\n\n“Wishes and Teardrops”\n\n“Simply Wonderful”\n\n“Who Can Tell?”\n\n“Luck to Sell”\n\n“Happy Guy”\n\n“Isn’t It Cozy?”\n\nCast[]\n\nPaul O’Keefe as “Chris” (Hans Christian Andersen)\n\nJack Gilford as Papa Andersen\n\nMargaret Hamilton as Mrs. Klopplebobbler\n\nSessue Hayakawa as The Mole\n\nPatty Duke as Thumbelina\n\nBoris Karloff as The Rat\n\nHayley Mills as The Little Mermaid\n\nBurl Ives as Father Neptune\n\nTallulah Bankhead as The Sea Witch\n\nVictor Borge as The Second Tailor\n\nEd Wynn as The Emperor\n\nRay Bolger as The Pieman\n\nCyril Ritchard as The Sandman\n\nTerry-Thomas as The First Tailor\n\nRobert Harter as Big Claus the game warden (uncredited)\n\nAdditional voices[]\n\nBillie Mae Richards as one of the Little Mermaid’s sisters\n\nLarry D.
