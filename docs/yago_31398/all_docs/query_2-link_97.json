The Edmonstone family is an old Scottish family that was raised to a baronetcy in 1774; their best-known member was the royal mistress Alice Keppel. Through this family connection, Elyssa and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall are third cousins. The couple are divorced since 25 June 2013, with annulment in 2016. The couple have three children, Archduke Leopold, Grand Prince of Tuscany, Archduchess Tatyana and Archduke Maximilian.[1]\n\nSigismund lives with his family in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 2017, the renunciation of French citizenship (obtained through his French mother) was legally recorded for him and his children.[5]"
