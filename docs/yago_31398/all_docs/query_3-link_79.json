Archbishop Renata, daughter of Archduke Karl Stephan of Austria, recently became engaged to Prince Hieronymus Radziwill at Saybusch Castle in Galicia.\n\nThe adolescent bride is the second daughter of Karl Stephan, from whose marriage with the Archduchess Maria Theresa, and born on 2 January 1888 to Pola. She is a brunette, elegant and interesting appearance. Her fiancé, Prince Hieronymus Radziwill, a son of Prince Dominik Radziwill, was born on January 6, 1885 in Cannes. His mother, Princess Dolores Radziwill, is a native Spaniard and was known by her maiden name da Agramonte. Links between Radziwills and ruling houses are not uncommon, although, as is historical, Emperor Wilhelm I, as a young prince, was forcibly prevented by his family from marrying his childhood sweetheart, the beautiful Princess Elise Radziwill.\n\nWedding in the Austrian imperial house\n\nOn the 16th at half past twelve in the morning, as announced in the archducal castle chapel of Saybusch, the wedding of the Archduchess Renata Maria with the Prince Hieronymus Radziwill took place.\n\nAfter the wedding ceremonies and the church ceremony in which Archduke Leopold Salvator appeared on behalf of the Emperor, the wedding guests went to the dining room on the ground floor of the castle, where congratulations were given to the bride and groom.\n\nA peasant deputation from the estate of Prince Radziwill in Balice, which had appeared in folk costumes, brought as a gift the artistically executed coat of arms of the princely Radziwill family.\n\nNow the gentlemen were in the large reception hall for the wedding dinner, where the representative of the emperor, Archduke Leopold Salvator, served a toast to the welfare of the bridal couple.\n\nPrince Ferdinand Radziwill delivered a toast in French on the Emperor Franz Joseph and the imperial house.\n\nThe bride wore the diadem in her rich hair, which her mother-in-law Princess Dolores Radziwill had given her, and in which seven large solitaires shine.\n\nA delicate wreath of orange blossoms was woven into the diadem, and above it the veil of genuine old lace fell, which is a precious family piece of the Radziwills.\n\nThe bridal gift of the emperor, the exceedingly magnificent diamond brooch, graced the bridal decollete.\n\nOn her honeymoon in Paris, the princess had a precious sable on her departure, which the bridegroom had presented to her in the \"Corbeille\" in the French manner.\n\nThe imperial wedding gifts to Archduchess Renata Princess Radziwill from 1909 have been handed down and can be seen in the picture above:\n\nDiamond ruby ​​diadem with double diamond riviera , from the mother of the bride Archduchess Maria Theresa,\n\nSix rows of beautiful pearls emerald clasp surrounded by diamonds from Archduchess Marie Rainer,\n\na pearl and diamond brooch from Queen Christine of Spain - the father's sister.\n\nDiamond corsage for 18,000 crowns from AEKöchert (according to the Köchert archive) from Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria\n\n(A false report with a diadem as a bridal gift for the Archduchess from the Emperor is wrong, a diamond brooch is recorded in the Köchert archive and not a diamond tiara)\n\na brooch made of rubies by Archduke Eugen,\n\na brooch made of diamonds, pearls and rubies from the siblings of the bride and Archduchess Mechtildis, Archduke Leo and Wilhelm.\n\nthe diamond diadem of Prince and Princess Radziwill - in the picture above.\n\na gold watch chain with rubies from Prince Hieronymus Radziwill.\n\nalso from the parents of the bride Archduke and Archduchess, vermeil covered with the Radziwill coat of arms, sable pelerine;
