        "text": "Biography\n\nSigismund was born in Lausanne the son of Archduke Leopold Franz and his first wife Princess Laetitia d'Arenberg, born Laetitia de Belzunce (and adopted by her stepfather Erik, 11th Duke of Arenberg). Sigismund was educated in computer science and has worked as a banker.\n\nIn 1993 Sigismund's father Leopold Franz renounced his rights as Head of the Grand Ducal Family of Tuscany in favour of Sigismund because his second marriage (after a divorce) conflicted with the laws of the Roman Catholic Order of Saint Stephen, of which he was then head. Since then, Sigismund has been the head of the grand ducal house of Tuscany.\n\nSigismund was raised in Uruguay and Switzerland by his mother and father. His maternal family are said to possess businesses in Uruguay.\n\nHonours\n\nSigismund is Grand Master of the Order of Saint Joseph and the Order of Saint Stephen, the two orders of knighthood of the Grand Ducal House of Tuscany. He has also a served as a patron for the Almanach de Gotha.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1999, Sigismund married Elyssa Edmonstone (born Glasgow, 11 September 1973), the only daughter of Sir Archibald Bruce Edmonstone, of Duntreath, 7th Baronet by his second wife Juliet Elizabeth Deakin. Archduchess Elyssa is a great-great-granddaughter of Marshall Field and a third cousin of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The Edmonstone family is an old Scottish family that was raised to a baronetcy in 1774; their best-known member was the royal mistress Alice Keppel. They are divorced since 25 June 2013, with annulment in 2016.\n\nThe couple have three children:\n\nArchduke Leopold Amadeo, Grand Prince of Tuscany (born 9 May 2001), heir apparent to the headship of the House of Tuscany\n\nArchduchess Tatyana of Austria, Princess of Tuscany (born 3 March 2003)\n\nArchduke Maximilian of Austria, Prince of Tuscany (born 27 May 2004)\n\nSigismund lives with his family in Lausanne, Switzerland."
