The House of Habsburg was one of the most important royal houses in Europe. Originating in Switzerland in the 11th century, they accumulated lands and power over subsequent centuries through strategic marriages and inheritance. They held the title of Holy Roman Emperor from 1438-1740 and ruled over a vast empire including Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, and territories in central Europe and the Americas. The house split into junior and senior branches in the 16th century and became extinct in the male line in the 18th century, being succeeded by other royal houses.",
