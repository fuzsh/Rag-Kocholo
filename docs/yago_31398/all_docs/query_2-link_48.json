        "text": "Archduke Peter Ferdinand Salvator Karl Ludwig Maria Joseph Leopold Anton Rupert Pius Pancrazwas born on 12 May 1874.� He was the younger brother of Archduke Josef Ferdinand, and his father was Grand Duke Ferdinand Salvatore Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Francesco Lodovico Gonzaga Raffaele Ranerio Gennaro of Tuscany (1835-1908).� He was married to Princess Maria Cristina di Borbon-Two Sicilies (1878-1947) at Cannes on 8 November 1900. Together, they had four children: Gottfried (1902-1984), Helena (1903-1924), Georg (1905-1952), and Walburga (1906-1983).\n\nAt war's start, Archduke Peter Ferdinand was a FML and in control of the 25. Infantry Division. This command he held until June 1915 and he surrendered it to GM Josef Poleschenski. GdI Archduke Peter Ferdinand was granted his own Corps in April 1917. He led this force successfully until August 1918. Archduke Peter Ferdinand ended up redesignating his force the V. Corps, succeeding GdI Karl Freiherr von Lukas whose own V. Corps had been disbanded. He retained this command until the very end of October, when the Corps, falling apart, was taken over by GM Rudolf M�ller. He covered the northern flank of the German XIV. Army during the Caporetto Offensive on 24 October 1917.� He was regarded by his superiors as a competant if unimaginative commander.\n\nGWS, 10/01 [rev. 11/03]\n\nAttention: Visit FEEFHS map room for a Map of Galicia including some of the placenames mentioned here.

St�ger-SteinerFrom the beginning of November, desperate preparations were being made west of Germany�s territory of Upper Silesia. The main enemy was Russia�s III. Caucasian Corps, which pushed to within only 5 miles of Upper Silesia. The 25. division defended a section of the critical Czenstochau-Bendzin railway, which ran parallel to the whole front, and was the most important supply route from Silesia for the entire Austrian 1. Army and Army Group Woyrsch. The Russians were aware of this and had their Cossack cavalry stage dozens of raids to destroy this track throughout November 1914. Peter Ferdinand�s forces were centered on the small town of Wlodowice, and the Russians were closer to the railway at this point than any other. By the end of the month, the Russians could press no closer to Silesia and instead looked to success at Krakau, relieving the Czenstochau sector of the worst pressure.\n\nGWS, 9/04\n\nOrders of Battle:� Polish Front, January 1915I.
