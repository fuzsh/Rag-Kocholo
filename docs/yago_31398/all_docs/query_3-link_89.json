        "text": "Thanks for the above postings, which illustrate Archduke Otto's descent from the Silesian Piast Dukes of Teschen (Cieszyn).\n\nThe branches of the Silesian Piasts which endured the longest in the agnatic (male) line seem to have been the Dukes of Teschen (Cieszyn) and the Dukes of Liegnitz-Brieg (Legnica-Brzeg).\n\nHere's a lineage (from Wikipedia) from the last 2 Dukes of Teschen (Cieszyn). I'd have preferred to use Polish or German names for accuracy, but I'll use English names, as that is how they are listed in Wikipedia:\n\n'Adam Wenceslaus, Duke of Cieszyn', father of:\n\n'Frederick William, Duke of Cieszyn' (1601-1625), (last Piast duke of Cieszyn), father of illegitimate son:\n\nWenceslaus Gottfried, Baron Hohenstein (circa 1608/12-circa 1672), father of:\n\n'Ferdinand II Hohenstein' (1681/1682-1706), who appears to be the very last male Piast.\n\nHere's a summary of the last Dukes of Legnica-Brzeg (Liegnitz-Brieg):\n\nDuke 'John Christian of Brieg' (1591-1639) divided his dukedoms among his 3 sons (Christian, George III, Louis IV). George III and Louis IV had no surviving sons, so ultimately 'Christian, Duke of Brieg' (1618-1672) inherited everything. Christian was the father of 'George William, Duke of Liegnitz' (1660-1675). George William died of a smallpox fever while still a teenager. He was the last reigning Piast Duke of Liegnitz, thus the last reigning Silesian Piast. However, his grandfather Duke John Christian did have a morganatic son from a later marriage ,'August of Legnica' (1627-1679), who had no surviving children, and who apparently was the last of the Legnica Piast line. George William's duchies, after his death, were incorporated into the Hapsburg lands of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nYoung Duke George William did have a sister Karoline, from whom a cognatic descent is traceable on Genealogics.org (which uses the German, not the English or Polish), names:\n\nKaroline von Liegnitz (1652-1707) mother of:\n\nLeopold, Duke of Holstein-Wiesenburg (1674-1744) father of:\n\nTheresia von Holstein-Wiesenburg (1713-1748) mother of:\n\nMaria zu Oettingen-Spielberg (1741-1795) mother of:\n\nMaria von Kaunitz-Rietberg (1775-1825) mother of:\n\nLeontine von Metternich-Winneburg (1811-1861) mother of:\n\nPauline Sandor de Szlavnicza (1836-1921) mother of:\n\nSofie von Metternich-Winneburg (1857-1941) mother of:\n\nElisabeth zu Oettingen-Spielberg (1886-1976) mother of:\n\nFranz Albrecht, (1920-2009), Prinz von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst & Duke of Ratibor und Corvey, father of:\n\nViktor (b.1964), Prinz von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst & Duke of Ratibor und Corvey.\n\nThis is a rather long female line of descent, moving through German and Hungarian nobility, during which no surviving male lines were established, but Viktor might conceivably be considered the senior lineal heir of the Silesian Piasts."
