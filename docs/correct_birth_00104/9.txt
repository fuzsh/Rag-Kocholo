93 Durnford Street, Plymouth, UK (unveiled on 24 june 1991)

« Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 1859-1930. In 1882 Conan Doyle practised medicine at No. 1 Dumford Street [2]. Unfortunately the relationship with his practice partner was an unhappy one and ended with Conan Doyle moving to Southsea. During his spare time from his medical profession he became more involved in his writings. 'A Study of Scarlet' [3], the first of 68 [4] stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, appeared in 1887. Conan Doyle's time in Devon undoubtedly inspired his later literary work, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'. A Holmes cult arose and still flourishes today. »

1-17 Elm Grove, Southsea, Portsmouth, UK (unveiled on 22 june 2006)

« Arthur Conan Doyle began his professional career as a GP at No. 1 Bush Villas in the summer of 1882. He had arrived in Portsmouth in the June of that year, from Plymouth, with no job, nowhere to live, and little more than £10 to his name. While he lived in Portsmouth, Conan Doyle threw himself into the life of the City. He joined the local Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society, gave numerous speeches on topics of the day, and played for the local cricket and bowls teams, as well as being the first goalkeeper for what is now Portsmouth Football Club. He also began a second career, writing successful novels including Micah Clarke and The White Company, as well as the first two Sherlock Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four. Portsmouth was, in this sense, the birthplace of the world's greatest ever fictional detective. By the time Arthur Conan Doyle left Portsmouth he had proved himself to be a great friend to many Portsmouth residents, an active local sportsman, and a successful and valued doctor. He had discovered spiritualism, become a father, and created one of the famous literary figures the world has ever known. It is little wonder that he remembered the City with such great fondness for the rest of his life. »
