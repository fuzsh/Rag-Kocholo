The pub stands in York Place close by to Picardy Place, near where the author's birthplace used to be. Picardy Place is also the home of the statue of Sir Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, which at the moment is kept in storage due to the tram works in the area.\n\nThe pub is known to be usually quieter than other city centre pubs, have very attentive but not intrusive staff, and great choice of Ales. The Conan Doyle serves food and provides its visitors with a free wi-fi. There are also fruit machines, quiz machines and Sky TV."
