        "text": "Above: A plaque at No2 Upper Wimpole Street, where Arthur Conan Doyle wrote some of his famous detective works.\n\nArthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland. From the age of nine, Arthur was sent for seven years to a Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire. From there he graduated in 1876, aged 17. Although his father’s surname was Doyle, as an adult Arthur adopted ‘Conan Doyle’ as his surname. Family tradition would have dictated the pursuit of an artistic career, after his father, but Conan Doyle decided to follow a medical one. He was influenced by Dr Bryan Charles Waller, a young lodger his mother had taken in to make ends meet. Dr Waller had trained at the University of Edinburgh and that is where Conan Doyle went to carry out his medical studies.\n\nWhile studying medicine, he was very impressed by one of his lecturers – Dr Joseph Bell who Conan Doyle observed to be a master at observation, logic, deduction, and diagnosis. Those qualities of brilliance in deduction became absorbed into the character of Sherlock Holmes. In 1881, Conan Doyle obtained his “Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery” degree. He went on two voyages as a ship’s doctor but realised that would not be a permanent job and later he set up a doctor’s practice in Portsmouth where, by the end of the third year, it started to earn him a comfortable income. During the next years, the young man divided his time between trying to be a good doctor and struggling to become a recognised author. In August 1885, he married a young woman called Louisa Hawkins, the sister of one of his patients. In 1887, Conan Doyle was able to have published “A Study in Scarlet” which introduced the famous characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.\n\nIn spite of his flourishing practice in Portsmouth, Conan Doyle decided to open a practice in London. It was in the elegant Upper Wimpole Street where, according to his autobiography, not a single patient ever crossed his doorstep. With time on his hands, he made the decision that he could not run a medical practice and try to be a writer. He chose to be a writer. His stories of Sherlock Holmes appeared in the Strand Magazine. Not only was he becoming well-known in England, his stories were also published in the United States.\n\nThe plaque on a house in Upper Wimpole Street records Conan Doyle living at the house and writing there in 1891. The fact that he was able to afford to have rooms at Upper Wimpole Street indicates that Conan Doyle was financially well off. Knowing that he lived there also probably explains why he devised the address of 221b Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes to have rooms. It is only a very short walk away from Upper Wimpole Street.\n\n-ENDS-"
