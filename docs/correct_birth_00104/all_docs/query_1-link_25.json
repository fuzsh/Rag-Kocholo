        "text": "(1859–1930). A Scottish physician who turned to writing, Arthur Conan Doyle thought he would be remembered for his historical novels. His fame, however, rests on his creation of the master detective of fiction, the incomparable Sherlock Holmes. (See also detective story.)\n\nArthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 22, 1859. He was the oldest son of Charles Doyle, a civil servant. His parents were Irish Roman Catholics, and he received his early education in a Jesuit school, Stonyhurst. Later he got a medical degree at Edinburgh University. He started practice as a family physician in Southsea, England. His income was small so he began writing stories to make ends meet. In 1891 he decided to give up medicine to concentrate on his writing.\n\nA Study in Scarlet, published in 1887, introduced Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson. The second Holmes story was The Sign of Four (1890). In 1891 Doyle began a series for Strand magazine called “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.”\n\nSherlock Holmes became known to movie and television audiences as a tall and lean, pipe-smoking, violin-playing detective. He lived at 221B Baker Street in London, where he was often visited by Watson, an associate in the many adventures. And according to Doyle, it was Watson who recorded the Holmes stories for posterity.\n\nDoyle said he modeled Holmes after one of his teachers in Edinburgh, Dr. Joseph Bell. Bell could, for example, glance at a corpse on the anatomy table and deduce that the person had been a left-handed shoemaker. “It is all very well to say that a man is clever,” Doyle wrote, “but the reader wants to see examples of it—such examples as Bell gave us every day in the wards.” The author eventually became bored with Holmes and “killed” him. In response to readers’ protests, Doyle wrote his next story explaining how the detective had miraculously survived the death struggle on the edge of a precipice. Stories dealing with Holmes’s exploits continued to appear almost to the end of Doyle’s life."
