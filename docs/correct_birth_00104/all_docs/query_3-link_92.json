Can you deduce a conclusion based on these facts?\n\nâ\n\nArthur Conan Doyle & the Adventures of the War Propaganda BureauÂ\n\nDoyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1859 and perfected his German while studying in Austria. After graduating from medical school in Edinburgh and Vienna, he carved out a sideline writing crime fiction. He earned $25 for the rights to A Study in Scarlet (1887), the first of 60 Holmes stories and novels featuring a consulting detective modeled after Doyleâs professor Dr. Joseph Bell.\n\nDetermined to support the British Army at the turn of the century, Doyle volunteered to work as a doctor on the frontline of South Africaâs Boer War for several months and wrote two short works justifying Britainâs role in the fighting.

Wells, Rudyard Kipling, and other literary legends signed an Authorsâ Declaration, a manifesto declaring Germanyâs invasion of Belgium was a crime and that Britain âcould not without dishonor have refused to take part in the present warâ.\n\nIt wouldnât be the last time Doyle would bolster the British governmentâs position during the war. Was he simply a patriot or was something more spooky afoot?Â\n\nDoyle boasts endlessly about his intelligence contacts in his autobiography Memoirs and Adventures. When Doyle isnât golfing with the British head of intelligence in Egypt, he's dining with Britain's Brig.-General John Charteris, WWI chief of intelligence at the British Expeditionary Force. Doyleâs tour of the warâs frontlines in 1916 is arranged by Thomas Wodehouse Legh, Britainâs paymaster-general who is also in charge of foreign propaganda. The Foreign Office stepped in with a Â£1,000 donation to help Doyle publish his 1902 Boer War pamphlet - completed with editorial assistance compliments of Britainâs âIntelligence Departmentâ.\n\nâ\n\nSherlock Holmes: The Curious Case of the Spy in the English countrysideâ\n\nDoyleâs Sherlock Holmes also had multiple dealings with British intelligence - retrieving top-secret documents in The Naval Treaty (1893), for example, and working directly for the British prime minister. In His Last Bow, Holmes is an undercover operative in an espionage operation involving a German spy.\n\nThere are no mysteries to solve in His Last Bow (1917). No elementary deductions. The narration is in the third person rather than told by Dr. John Watson. Why the sudden change after Doyle had used the same formula for 30 years? Some readers believe Doyle wrote the story as another propaganda tool to boost morale as WWI dragged into its third devastating year. âThere's an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet,â Holmes tells Watson. âIt will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind nonetheless, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared.â\n\nâ\n\nSherlock Holmes: The Return of the Propaganda Detective\n\nââ\n\nDuring WWII, Universal brought Holmes to the big screen in three movies, positioning Sherlock (Basil Rathbone) as a counterintelligence expert who foils Nazi plots. The films are notable for reinforcing three key propaganda messages: Britain was engaged in a 'people's war'; citizens should be wary of Nazi agents and fifth columnists, and; America and Britain would succeed because they had strong ties based on mutual respect and a shared culture.\n\nNever mind that Doyle had already died of a heart attack in 1930. Sherlock Holmes lived on to fight the Nazis from his new home in Hollywood.\n\nThere is no disputing that Sherlock Holmes had transformed into a British government spy by the 1917 publication of His Last Bow. The mystery is whether Sherlockâs creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, did also.\n\nAs Holmes might deduce: âWhen you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.â\n\nâ\n\nâ"
