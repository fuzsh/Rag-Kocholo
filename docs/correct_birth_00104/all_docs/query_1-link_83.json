He was born in Edinburgh on May 22, 1859, and he attended medical school in the city from 1876 to 1881. Following his term at university, Doyle signed on as a ship’s surgeon aboard the , bound for the west coast of Africa.

Mayumba The Narrative of John Smith A Study in Scarlet Beeton’s Christmas Annual Micah Clarke Doyle is now best remembered for the fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring his fictional Sherlock Holmes, but he was a terrifically prolific writer besides. His interests ranged freely across multiple subjects, genres, and disciplines, and he wrote his first book at the age of six. The complete bibliography of his writings features over 200 titles that include science-fiction, historical novels, plays, romances, poetry, essays, political pamphlets, and even a six-volume history of the First World War. Because nearly all of his Holmes and Professor Challenger stories were first published in ’s , Doyle’s name will be forever associated with that journal, but the majority of his fiction and non-fiction appeared across a broad range of British and American magazines.

Doyle’s , which appeared in three consecutive issues of , was a series of historical romances that vividly recalled three of the great invasions of world history: the coming of the Huns to Rome, the Saxons’ arrival in Britain, and the Muslim conquest of North Africa and Asia Minor. Each installment of the series— (November 1910; 548-53), (December 1910; 655-59), and (January 1911; 24-28)—was beautifully illustrated by , whose color plate for —which featured armored Saxons carrying shields and horned helmets—served as the for the magazine’s November 1910 issue. consulting detective George Newnes Strand Magazine Lippincott’s Monthly The Sign of the Four Harper’s The Refugees McClure’s The Clamor of the Arctic Collier’s Weekly The Return of Sherlock Holmes Scribner’s Magazine Through the Mists Scribner’s A Forgotten Tale, Howard Pyle Bret Harte Through the Mists Scribner’s The Coming of the Huns The First Cargo The Red Star N.
