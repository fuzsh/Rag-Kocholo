        "text": "Dame Jean Conan Doyle\n\nAlexis Barquin, creator of the Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopaedia has published a biography on Jean Conan Doyle.\n\nDame Jean Conan Doyle was Arthur Conan Doyle's fifth child and owned the rights to his works for the longest period after his death. The Conan Doyle Estate was set up to manage the rights on behalf of the beneficiaries of Jean's will. It is entirely fitting that this biography should be written by Jon Lellenberg with amendments and additions by Richard Pooley of The Conan Doyle Estate.\n\nThe biography is a fascinating read and is accompanied by some wonderful family photography and film footage."
