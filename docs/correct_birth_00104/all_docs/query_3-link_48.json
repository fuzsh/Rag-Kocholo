        "text": "Dr. Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, KStJ, DL is a writer from the United Kingdom of Group Chats. He is best known for writing The Adventures of Professor Challenger, as well as serving as the literary agent of Sherlock Holmes and John H. Watson.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nConan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, to his parents Charles Altamount Doyle and Mary Acelin Doyle. His father was an artist, famous for his political comics.\n\nDoyle lost his father at a young age due to alcoholism and severe psychiatric illness.\n\nMedical Career[]\n\nConan Doyle went to university and studied under Dr. Joseph Bell, the Chief Doctor and director at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. During this time he also happened to meet Dr. Michael Stamford and Dr. John H Watson in earnest conversation with one Sherlock Holmes.\n\nAfter he graduated, Doyle moved to the most popular spot in London, or as close to it as he could manage.\n\nIt was during this time he began to write a number of short stories.\n\nLiterary Career[]\n\nBarely getting enough patients to pay the rent, Conan Doyle became a writer and literary agent, frequently having his works published in The Randst Magazine.\n\nLiterary agent to The Great Detective of the Foggy City[]\n\nConan Doyle is best known for being the literary agent of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H Watson, perhaps the one responsible for the initial publication of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Though he has grown to dislike the fame received for holding such a title.\n\nProfessor Challenger[]\n\nConan Doyle is also famous for being the creator of the Professor Challnger series, but wishes that it were more popular than The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nPoetry and Essays[]\n\nConan Doyle is also famous for writing a number of nature-based poems, as well as a number of military and medical essays, such as \"Why the Afghan War was Right\", and \"Jab your kids: A thesis on why compulsory vaccination is a good thing\".\n\nPolitical Career and Advocate for Justice[]\n\nElectoral Run[]\n\nConan Doyle had a brief political career, running to be the Whig MP for Edindee. However, he was never elected to office. It is believed that Bill Hawkes commented \"Stupid man should stick to detective novels\" once he heard of it.\n\nSetting up the court of appeal[]\n\nInspired by Mr. Holmes, Doyle worked to lobby government instead and to set up the official Court of Appeal.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle: Literary Detective[]\n\nConan Doyle also solved a number of mysteries in his own time, clearing the names of several men who were charged with false allegations, apparently inspired by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H Watson themselves.\n\nOne case involved a man having an alibi as he was watching a play about Sherlock Holmes, ironically.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nHarry Houdini[]\n\nConan Doyle has had a long-standing relationship with spiritualism, which was only increased further by his friendship with one Harry Houdini, said to convince Conan Doyle that magic was real by using \"the old rubber hand trick\".\n\nAgatha Christie[]\n\nIt is believed that Conan Doyle maintains a friendly rivalry with rival novelist Agatha Christie. This is shown especially after he contacted a spirit medium after her disappearance, and he showed genuine relief when she was found again.\n\nJean Leckie[]\n\nConan Doyle has been happily married to Jean Leckie for the last ten years or so. Though Ms. Leckie has shown some distaste to her husband's love of spiritualism and hatred of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nSherlock Holmes[]\n\nConan Doyle, much like John H. Watson, shows exasperation around Holmes, and has often said that he hates the man. He has also explicitly said:\n\n\"If I am only ever known as the man who published Sherlock Holmes, I will have considered my entire life a failure\"\n\nJohn H Watson[]\n\nConan Doyle often sympathises with Watson, knowing almost exactly what he has to go through."
