        "text": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a Scottish author who found fame writing about the detective Sherlock Holmes. Doyle was a prolific writer who also wrote science fiction, historical novels, plays, romances, poetry, and non-fiction, and in an effort to get away from writing about Holmes and concentrate on other projects, he famously killed the character in 1893's story \"The Final Problem.\" Holms fans were so outraged that Doyle brought him back. All told, Doyle wrote the beloved character into 56 short stories and four novels, and many authors since have continued his adventures."
