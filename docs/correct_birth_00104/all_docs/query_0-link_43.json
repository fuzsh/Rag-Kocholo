        "text": "Sherlock Holmes Statue, Picardy Place, Edinburgh.\n\nThis evening, I am focusing on Edinburgh’s connection with the famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. The author was Edinburgh educated, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle ( 1859-1930).\n\nWithin a very compact area of Edinburgh’s New Town can be found:\n\nThe Conan Doyle Pub at 71-73 York Place.\n\nPicardy Place, opposite the pub, where Conan Doyle was born in 1859.\n\nSt. Mary’s Cathedral (R.C.) where Conan Doyle was baptised.\n\nA statue of the detective, in Picardy Place. This is a classical representation featuring deerskin outfit, pipe and magnifying glass.\n\nThere is another Edinburgh dimension to the Holmes character in form of Joseph Bell (1837-1911). This gentleman was a lecturer at Edinburgh University’s Medical School at time Conan Doyle was a student there. Bell was a pioneer in forensic science and proved a key influence on the creation of the famous detective.\n\nAll the key sites listed above can be accessed on foot from central Edinburgh.\n\nThere is also a Sherlock Holmes walking tour of Edinburgh available.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on Edinburgh and other aspects of Scotland please refer Visitors’ Guide to Scotland, ISBN 978-1-9161332-0-4. This book is also available via Kindle."
