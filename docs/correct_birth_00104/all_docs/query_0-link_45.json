        "text": "THE CONANÂ DOYLEÂ RESTAURANT\n\nSir Arthur Conan Ignatius Doyle was born in Edinburgh on May 22, 1859. Doyle was a medical doctor who is best known for his literary creation, Sherlock Holmes, he also wrote a number of other stories involving Prof Challenger who appears in Doyleâs story The Lost World. He also wrote about the âmystery shipâ, The Mary Celeste. He also had a great interest in the topic of spiritualism. A number of his stories have been made into films. He himself appears in the silent 1925 version the The Lost World and in an interview in which he talks about Holmes and his own interest in spiritualism.\n\nSince this is the month of Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâs birth, we thought we would tell you about a restaurant in Edinburgh which is named after him - and then throw in a few more bits about him that can be seen in Edinburgh.\n\nThe ConanÂ DoyleÂ Restaurant is located diagonally across the street from the house where Sir Arthur ConanÂ DoyleÂ was born. One of the Nicholsonâs pubs,Â this charming and cozy place has beautiful dining areas, should you be interested in formal dining. It also has a pub area where one can get a quick snack if you prefer. Their menu features British cuisine some of which are served year round and others are wonderfully seasonal.\n\nThe restaurant is well stocked with a variety of ales and wines that will compliment any of the meals you chose.\n\nThe ConanÂ DoyleÂ Restaurant is located at 71-73 York Place in Edinburgh (0131 5579539).Â You can also visit their web site.\n\nDiagonally across the street from the restaurant is 11 Picardy Place, where Doyle was born. The house no longer exists, but there is a statue of Sherlock Holmes."
