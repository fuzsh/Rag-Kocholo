It also became the home to The Edinburgh Association of Spiritualists in October 2011.\n\nThe Centre provides a varied programme of workshops, seminars and worship in a comfortable and welcoming sitting. Since lockdown we have also been delivering a large number of online events that have been attracting people from all around the world."
