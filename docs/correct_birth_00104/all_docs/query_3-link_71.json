        "text": "Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh, Scotland. The third of ten siblings, his father, Charles Altamont Doyle, a talented illustrator, was born in England of Irish descent, and his mother, born Mary Foley, was Irish. They were married in 1855. Although he is now referred to as “Conan Doyle”, the origin of this compound surname (if that is how he meant it to be understood) is uncertain. His baptism record in the registry of St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh gives ‘Arthur Ignatius Conan’ as his Christian name, and simply ‘Doyle’ as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.\n\nAt the age of nine Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit preparatory school, Hodder Place, Stonyhurst. He then went on to Stonyhurst College, leaving in 1875. From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. One of his professors at the university was Dr Joseph Bell, who became the model for Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. It was Bell who drummed into Doyle’s head the importance of using his innate powers of observation to help him deduce the nature of a patient’s affliction. While in school, Conan Doyle began writing to earn a little extra money. His first story, The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley was published in “Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal” on 1879. Shortly after, his father fell ill, and Doyle was forced to become the breadwinner for the family. He worked for a time as a ship’s doctor on the SS Mayumba during a voyage to the West African coast, then opened his own medical practice near Portsmouth. In his spare time he did more writing.\n\nIn 1885 Conan Doyle married Louisa (or Louise) Hawkins, known as “Touie”. She suffered from tuberculosis and died on 4 July 1906. The following year he married Jean Elizabeth Leckie, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897. Due to his sense of loyalty he had maintained a purely platonic relationship with Jean while his first wife was alive. Jean died in London on 27 June 1940. Conan Doyle fathered five children. Two with his first wife—Mary Louise (28 January 1889 – 12 June 1976), and Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (15 November 1892 – 28 October 1918). With his second wife he had three children—Denis Percy Stewart (17 March 1909 – 9 March 1955), Adrian Malcolm (19 November 1910–3 June 1970) and Jean Lena Annette (21 December 1912–18 November 1997).\n\nHis third attempt at a novel was A Study in Scarlet in which he introduced Sherlock Holmes to the world. When it was first published in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887, the story attracted little public interest. In America however the editor of Lippincott’s Magazine found A Study in Scarlet interesting and Doyle was asked to meet a Lippincott representative paying a visit to London. As a result of a dinner at which Oscar Wilde was also present, both Wilde and Doyle wrote books for the magazine. Wilde’s book was The Picture of Dorian Gray and Doyle’s was The Sign of the Four which appeared in Lippincott’s in February 1890. As in the case with the first book The Sign of Four was not successful, and it wasn’t until a year later, when the first short story to feature Sherlock Holmes “A Scandal in Bohemia” was published in The Strand Magazine. This story soon became extremely popular and helped to increase the sales of The Strand, which enabled Conan Doyle to ask more money for his following stories. The stories were later collected in book form on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of The Strand Magazine, under the title The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. In 1894 Conan Doyle, tired of his own creation, killed Holmes off in The Final Problem.\n\nHe underestimated the popularity of his own creation. So great was the hold that the character of Sherlock Holmes had taken on the public imagination that Conan Doyle found himself at the centre of a storm of controversy. He was inundated with letters of protest, including one from a female reader who addressed him simply as “You Brute!”. He bowed to the inevitable, and revived the character of Holmes, who appeared in numerous short stories over the next 23 years.\n\nBut Conan Doyle did not confine himself to Sherlock Holmes; he wrote several popular works of historic fiction, including Micah Clarke (1888), The White Company (1890), Rodney Stone (1896), and Sir Nigel (1906).\n\nConan Doyle served as a doctor in the Boer War, and on his return he wrote two books defending England’s participation in that conflict. It was for these books that he received his knighthood in 1902.\n\nAfter the death of his son in World War I, Conan Doyle became interested in spiritualism. He was convinced that it was possible to communicate with the dead, and his views led to a certain amount of ridicule from more mainstream society.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle died on July 7, 1930, and is buried in the churchyard at Minstead, Hampshire. He can rightly be credited with helping create the literary genre of the detective story. Though Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin predates Sherlock Holmes, it was the Holmes’ stories that solidified in the public mind what a good detective should be.\n\nAll the Holmes stories and many other works by Conan Doyle are available via Project Gutenberg.\n\nThe Canon of Sherlock Holmes: Traditionally the so-called Canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In this context, the term “canon” is an attempt to distinguish between Doyle’s original works and subsequent works by other authors using the same characters. The traditional canon—usually capitalized by aficionados of the Sherlockian game as “the Canon”—consists of four novels and 56 short stories. The description of these 60 adventures as the Sherlock Holmes canon and the game of applying the methods of “Higher Criticism” to it was started by Ronald Knox as a playful use of the traditional definition of Canon as an authoritative list of books accepted as Holy Scripture. (Source: Wikipedia). The four novels of the canon are A Study in Scarlet (1887), The Sign of the Four (1890), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902) and The Valley of Fear (1914–1915). The 56 short stories are collected in five books:The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes 12 stories (1892); The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes 12 stories (1894); The Return of Sherlock Holmes 13 stories (1905);His Last Bow 7 stories (1917) and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes 12 stories (1927).\n\nExtracanonical works (The Apocrypha): In addition to the sixty stories of the Canon, Arthur Conan Doyle also published more material, that remained hidden, secret or obscure until 1980, that shaded new light on Doyle’s relationship with his most famous creation. These works include plays, poems, essays on the character and even short stories, that were collected in books such as: Sherlock Holmes: The Published Apocrypha. edited in 1980 by by Jack Tracy, The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, edited in 1981 by Peter Haining, The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes, edited in 1983 by Richard Lancelyn Green; and in 2009 the final volume of Leslie S. Klinger’s Sherlock Holmes Reference Library titled The Apocrypha of Sherlock Holmes, not to mention the play Angels of Darkness published in 2001. While newspaper or magazine articles might be rediscovered shedding new light on Doyle’s relationship with his most famous creation, it seems highly improbable that any more material from Doyle’s hand will appear that will be included in that select section called the Apocrypha.\n\nSherlock Holmes stories byMike Grost: The core of Doyle’s accomplishment are the three first volumes of Sherlock Holmes stories, The Adventures, The Memoirs and The Return. Many of these tales contain brilliant puzzle plots, with remarkable surprise endings. They also are loaded with genuinely colorful and imaginative events. Doyle’s mysteries tend to center around situations. He tends to present the reader with some extremely puzzling situation, one that is difficult to explain. He then solves the mystery, by developing some brilliant twist that stands the apparent situation on its head.\n\nDoyle had little interest in alibis in his work. This is not because mystery fiction was unaware of them: they were used by such 1860’s writers as Harriet Prescott Spofford and Charles Martel. In general, Doyle was not deeply interested in whodunit. He did not present a crime, have several suspects around who might equally have committed it, and then challenge the reader to pick which one of them actually did. Doyle’s very popular contemporary Fergus Hume did this in The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), a book Doyle had read, and disliked. So Doyle could have set up his mysteries this way: he had certainly seen the pattern in Hume’s work. Whodunits were also used by Anna Katherine Green, another author whose work Doyle knew. Doyle only rarely begins his stories with a murder. Instead, Holmes is most commonly called on to investigate a theft, blackmail, a disappearance, or a strange job a middle class person is asked to do, as in “The Red-Headed League”, “The Adventure of the Copper Beeches” or “The Stockbroker’s Clerk”. When there is a killing, it is often a byproduct of a theft, such as in “Silver Blaze” or “The Reigate Puzzle”. “The Boscombe Valley Mystery” is an example of a full-fledged murder mystery within the Holmes canon.\n\nDoyle, and Holmes and Watson, loved the fantastic, the outré and the bizarre in his cases. He is at the start of a great tradition of surrealism in modern mystery fiction. Virtually all the great 20th Century authors of detective stories had a strong surrealist element to their work. This cuts across schools. It is a dominant tradition among intuitionist writers, such as Carr, Queen and Chesterton, but one also finds it in Rinehart, Frederick Irving Anderson, and other Early American writers of their generation, and among Freeman, Sayers and the Realist school. Most of these writers were strongly influenced by Doyle, and paid written tribute to his work. Throughout this Guide I have often referred to this as a “surrealist” aspect of their work; but Doyle’s fiction preceded by many years both Surrealism, and its ancestor Dada. Dada emerged around World War I, c1917, with Surrealism following in the 1920’s, while Doyle’s love for the bizarre was emphasized in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes of 1891 – 1892. Doyle also influenced surrealist-like activity in other media, such as film. For example, take Juve contre Fantômas (1913). This hour long film is Chapter 2 of Louis Feuillade’s movie serial Fantômas. The bedroom scenes here seem to be directly derived from Doyle’s “The Adventure of the Speckled Band” (1892). Feuillade’s work was much admired by the Surrealists.\n\nDoyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories were huge popular successes. It has become de rigueur for histories of mystery fiction to attempt to explain why. But, after reading a dozen or so such purported explanations, I remain skeptical that critics actually know why. Shouldn’t any genuine explanation involve interviewing the public, asking them questions about why they like the stories, and analyzing their responses, perhaps using statistics? A critic can explain why he or she likes the stories; but just by analyzing the story itself, cannot really determine what the public thinks about it. Unfortunately, as far as I know, there were no pollsters around in the 1890’s measuring public attitudes."
