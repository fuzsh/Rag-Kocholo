Goldfarb, 1997.\n\n* * *\n\nAlthough Arthur Conan Doyle refused to make any great claims for his short fiction and insisted that his work was inferior to Poe or Maupassant, he remains one of the great masters of the modern short story. In scope alone he was certainly one of the most prolific authors of his generation, and his stories embraced a wide range of subjects, from adventure and crime to medicine and sport. And, of course, one short story in particular, \"A Study in Scarlet\" (1887), gave birth to Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson.\n\nAs a struggling young medical practitioner, Doyle had turned to writing short fiction as a means of supplementing his income, but what started as a prop became an all-consuming passion. His interest in the short story as a literary form had been fired by the publication of \"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley\" in September 1879 while he was working as an assistant in Birmingham. Other stories of note include \"The Captain of the Pole-Star\" for Temple Bar (February 1883) and \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" for the Cornhill (January 1884), but it was in the pages of Strand Magazine that Doyle was to reach his most enthusiastic public through the creation of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nStarting with the publication in July 1891 of \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" Doyle followed Holmes's adventures until \"The Final Problem\" in December 1893, when he killed him off along with his arch enemy Professor Moriarty. Such was the public demand for Holmes's genius for scientific detection, though, that Doyle had to resurrect him and he reappeared in the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles and again in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes. By then Holmes and Watson had become public property and their success helped to make Doyle one of the most popular authors of his day.\n\nAt Doyle's own admission, one of the models for Holmes was Dr. Joseph Bell (1837-1911), one of his Edinburgh teachers and a pioneer of forensic medicine whose deductive abilities had much impressed his students. The name owed its origins to the American poet Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-94), who was much admired by Doyle. Sherlock Holmes became, and remains, a cult figure and the concept of his powers of rapid deduction, allied to Watson's slow-thinking empiricism, was an irresistible literary invention. Moreover, Doyle developed a simple narrative formula that suited the spirit of the late Victorian age, and he had the happy ability of suggesting to his readers that they too were part of the story.\n\nIn Holmes, Doyle created a believable and admirable character. Although Holmes is intellectually arrogant and occasionally pompous, he balanced those failings with attributes that made the detective attractive to the average reader. Holmes is financially independent, a thorough patriot, and strong minded, and he possessed a flair for showmanship. Despite being a commoner, he is a confidant of royalty and the aristocracy whom he wins over by the sheer force of his personality. At the same time he has a number of failings that give him a human touch—a liking for black shag tobacco and occasional shots of cocaine. Small wonder that Doyle had difficulties breaking away from him as the subject of his best short fiction.\n\nHowever, Doyle also made good use of his time away from Holmes's domination. From the 1890s until his death 40 years later, he wrote and published a wide range of stories, all with different backgrounds and styles. Although not a soldier, he wrote a number of stories of army life, enlivened by his powers of observation, not only of the physical background but also of the military type. \"A Regimental Scandal\" and \"The Colonel's Choice\" both deal with the sensitive topic of military honor. History, too, was an all-abiding concern, particularly the Regency period. His earliest stories set at that time, \"The Great Shadow\" and \"An Impression of the Regency,\" prefigure the exploits and adventures of Brigadier Gerard, the cavalry officer whom Napoleon says has \"the stoutest heart in my army.\" In stories like \"The Medal of Brigadier Gerard\" the soldier leaps out of history's pages to become Doyle's happiest and most amusing fictional creation.\n\nOnce he had become financially secure through the Holmes's stories, much of Doyle's short fiction was written for pleasure. The stories collected in The Last Galley: Impressions and Tales betray his interest in archaeology and collecting fossils, concerns that were to lead to his novel The Lost World. Ancient history was another interest and he used it to good effect in stories like \"The Centurion\" (1922). His last story, \"The Last Resource\" (1930), is set in the underworld of America during the prohibition era and is remarkable for the way in which Doyle managed to capture the local speech rhythms.\n\nInevitably, given the scale of his output, some of Doyle's stories were either incorporated into later fiction or look forward to it. \"The Cabman's Story\" (1884) is set in London and can be read as a precursor to the Holmes's stories; the same is true of \"The Winning Shot\" (1883), which contains echoes of the nighttime countryside of The Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nThere are other connections. In all his fiction Doyle demonstrated great powers of observation—a consequence of his own medical training—and he showed himself to be at home in a wide variety of backgrounds. Allied to the sheer exuberance of his literary style and the range of his interests, these virtues mark Doyle as the first writer to put the short story on a professional footing.\n\n—Trevor Royle"
