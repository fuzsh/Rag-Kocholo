When he was a young boy he liked reading books.\n\nIn 1876 he bagan studying medicine at Edinburg University. One of his prefessors was Dr. Joseph Bell. Dr Bell watched his patientes closely so that he could understand their illness. Later Dr Bell became Conan Doyle’s model for Sherlock Holmes. In 1882 Conan Doyle became a doctor. He did not have many patients so he began writting his first Sherlock Holmes story, A study in Scarlet (1887).\n\nThe story was a big success.\n\nIn 1891 he wrote Sherlock Holmes stories for a monthly magazine called The Strand. Soon the clever detective and his friend Dr Watson became popular in Great Britain. When Conan Doyle stopped writting Sherlock Holmes stories his readers got angry.\n\nFinally in 1901 he starter writting another Sherlock Holmes adventure called The Hound of the Baskervilles. A lot of other stories followed. His readers were very pleased and he continued writting about the famous detective untile 1927.\n\nSome famous Sherlock Holmes books are The sign of Four (1890), The adventure of Sherlock Holmes (1892) and The case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1927). The Red Circe is the part of the book ‘His Last Bow’ (1917).\n\nConan Doyle died in England on 7 July 1930."
