        "text": "Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh in the year 1859. He was a doctor in his first profession, but he also had a great knack for literature. He wrote many different kinds of stories although he is best known for his Sherlock Holmes tales. He wrote his first Sherlock Holmes story in 1886, and it was called \"A Study in Scarlet.\" He gave up his medical carrer in 1891 so he could devote himself completely to his writing. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes took off, almost to have a mind of his own. He did not want to completely be known for for Holmes stories so he tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes in 1893. The story was called \"The Final Problem.\" It was not that was for Conan Doyle, though; the public would not let Holmes die. After years of complaints, Conan Doyle brought Holmes back in the 1902 tale of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\" This tale supposedly took place before Holmes' death. Within the year, a new series came out; Holmes revealed to Watson that he has escaped death. There were many more tales after that; the last coming out in 1927. Arthur Conan Doyle died soon after the last tale in the year 1930."
