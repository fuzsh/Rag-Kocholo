Sherlock Holmes Statue, Picardy Place, Edinburgh.

This evening, I am focusing on Edinburgh’s connection with the famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. The author was Edinburgh educated, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle ( 1859-1930).

Within a very compact area of Edinburgh’s New Town can be found:

The Conan Doyle Pub at 71-73 York Place.

Picardy Place, opposite the pub, where Conan Doyle was born in 1859.

St. Mary’s Cathedral (R.C.) where Conan Doyle was baptised.

A statue of the detective, in Picardy Place. This is a classical representation featuring deerskin outfit, pipe and magnifying glass.

There is another Edinburgh dimension to the Holmes character in form of Joseph Bell (1837-1911). This gentleman was a lecturer at Edinburgh University’s Medical School at time Conan Doyle was a student there. Bell was a pioneer in forensic science and proved a key influence on the creation of the famous detective.

All the key sites listed above can be accessed on foot from central Edinburgh.

There is also a Sherlock Holmes walking tour of Edinburgh available.
