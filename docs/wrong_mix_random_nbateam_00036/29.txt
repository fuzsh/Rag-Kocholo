Two years ago, Bramlette began managing and producing Mustang Mesa, the highly acclaimed country and rock band headed by lead guitarist and song writer Steve Bowen, out of Nashville, Tennessee. Marketing, promoting and nurturing the band's success, is just a fraction of what RREG LLC is accomplishing.

Cale Carver, Vice President of Business Affairs

Cales passion for music runs deep in his veins. From the time he was a young boy, the sounds of music rang threw his ears. From his father he inherited a passion for music. Cale grew up listening to his fathers vinyl record collection & listening to David play the piano. Vinyl records and going to rock concerts with his dad as early from seven years old give Cale the backbone for his school of rock. Finally after several years of asking, Cales dad took him to his first KISS show. The KISS Dynasty Tour in 1980 was the best experience that Cale & his father ever shared together. Three days later Cales dad was killed in a plane crash. Today the vinyl collection numbers over 3,500 records.
