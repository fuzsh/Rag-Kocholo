        "text": "Although it’s associated almost exclusively with jazz, singers outside that genre have employed scat singing. [Check the conclusion of this post for a more complete explanation of the term.] Jackie Wilson used the technique effectively many times, although always in relatively short passages. You hear it on a live performance audiotape late in his career, as well as on the videotape of one of his last performances (below), on “That’s Why (I Love You So).” The “scat bits” appear at the 1:50 and 2:00 marks.\n\nThere are certain features of some Jackie Wilson recordings that I particularly like. For example, I love male backup singers with Jackie’s voice, and although there are relatively few songs that use them, many of those that do are among my favorites. These include all the versions I’ve heard of “She’s Alright.”\n\nBut I am also particularly fond of Jackie’s scat singing, and one of my favorite examples of it comes at the opening and closing of “When Will Our Day Come,” which I always think of as “Jackie’s civil rights song.” You can listen to this marvelous recording here.\n\nYou can also listen to Jackie interjecting a scat line into his masterful “It’s So Fine” (here). Frankly, I have no idea where to draw the proper limits of scat singing, but I include the much-loved opening of “So Much” (here), which my sister thought was some sort of “weird instrument” playing.\n\nOne more for now: “By the Light of the Silvery Moon” (here) is to many people’s surprise the flip side of “Reet Petite” and dates from Jackie’s first recording session with Dick Jacobs, who was delighted with Jackie’s scatting during the bridge. Jackie vocalizes so high that his biographer noted, “it sounds like a woman yodeling.”\n\nSammy and Ella’s tutorial. Scat singing (or scatting, a term which may be out of vogue now) is singing nonsense syllables or sounds or words that do not make literal sense. It allows the singer to play at being an instrumentalist and improvise “away from the lyrics.” Scat singing belongs properly to the world of jazz singing, where Ella Fitzgerald was the unchallenged queen of practitioners. Look at this old Ed Sullivan Show clip for a tutorial on the art form given by Miss Fitzgerald and the enormously talented Mr. Sammy Davis Jr. Sammy starts the scat singing at roughly the 1:23 mark\n\nKeith Channer in St. Petersburg. The video below is an additional and very fine illustration of scat singing from our fellow Jackie Wilson aficionado, singer/pianist Keith Channer. Subscribe to Keith’s YouTube channel for a variety of musical treats in not only jazz, but also rock and other popular music genres. Don’t miss his wonderful tributes to Jackie Wilson (I gave him a hard time in my comment there, but he does a great job on “Baby Workout”) and Little Richard (“Good Golly Miss Molly”). Keith, who has recently returned from a tour in China, is featured below on an earlier tour, accompanied by Russian musicians as he performs “Take the A-Train.”\n\nNote: In the months since I posted this article, I have been discussing the Little Rock concert with Jesse Belvin Jr and others, sharing information and contacts. Having found significant errors in the reporting done by Eric Lenaburg, I no longer have faith in any of the information he provided. (For example, I have discovered that Jackie Wilson was indeed, as one would have expected, the headliner for the event.) As my own research progresses, I may revise or delete this article. As of now, I caution readers against accepting Lenaburg’s assertions, including even the assertion that the concert’s audience was integrated. I have now changed the font of these portions of the article to “strikethrough.” Needless to add, the questions I posed at the article’s conclusion are now more complicated.\n\nIn Part One of this posting, I mentioned that “Brown-Eyed Handsome Man” was not the only popular song to reflect the realities of race in America during 1955-1968, the years of the African American Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn July 1958, Anthony Gourdine charted the first hit of many he made with his group, Little Anthony and the Imperials. The A-side, “Tears on My Pillow,” became the group’s signature tune; however, the B-side, written by the group’s own Ernest Wright, got ample play and became a performance staple for the group. “Two People in the World” has very few words, but its point cannot be missed or misinterpreted: The voice is male and Black. The Great Taboo was on the turntables again.\n\n[Note: I could not find a YouTube posting of the original B-side version, but there is a wonderful alternate version here and an utterly spectacular live a cappella performance by the group which must have occurred sometime after 2010, given the lineup. Ernest Wright (second from the left) and Anthony would be close to seventy years old. If you are young and do not already know why so many of us old people love doo wop and revere its singers, either of these performances should provide all the necessary explanation.]\n\nThere are just two kinds of people in the world\n\nWhy can’t we fall in love?\n\nThere are just two kinds of people in the world\n\nThey are a boy and girl\n\nLittle Anthony and the Imperials hailed from New York City, of course, but the tune I want to direct attention to next was recorded in the state of Texas by southern white guys.\n\nRunning Bear and Little White Dove. You can find numerous postings of the Johnny Preston recording of “Running Bear” on YouTube, and I will let you take your pick of them. Although many of the videos “illustrate” the song, the fascinating thing is that not one of these renderings alludes to the song’s actual subject matter. Maybe the creators of these videos are too young to know the song’s context.\n\nWhen this song was No. 1 in the nation, none of us listening to it thought the lovers were Native Americans. Little White Dove was white and Running Bear was Black, and the river in which they drowned was racism. The river had no bridge, so young love perished.\n\n[Update: There is now a YouTube post of Johnny Preston doing a lip sync of the song on Dick Clark’s Beechnut gum show.]\n\nRunning Bear\n\n(Words and music by J P Richardson)\n\nOn the bank of the river\n\nStood Running Bear\n\nYoung Indian brave\n\nOn the other side of the river\n\nStood his lovely Indian maid\n\nLittle White Dove was-a her name\n\nSuch a lovely sight to see\n\nBut their tribes fought with each other\n\nSo their love could never be\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love big as the sky\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love that couldn’t die\n\nHe couldn’t swim the raging river\n\n‘Cause the river was too wide\n\nHe couldn’t reach the Little White Dove\n\nWaiting on the other side\n\nIn the moonlight he could see her\n\nBlowing kisses ‘cross the waves\n\nHer little heart was beating faster\n\nWaiting there for her brave\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love big as the sky\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love that couldn’t die\n\nRunning Bear dove in the water\n\nLittle White Dove did the same\n\nAnd they swam out to each other\n\nThrough the swirling stream they came\n\nAs their heads touched and their lips met\n\nThe raging river pulled them down\n\nNow they’ll always be together\n\nIn that happy hunting ground\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love big as the sky\n\nRunning Bear loved Little White Dove\n\nWith a love that couldn’t die\n\n“Running Bear” was written by J P Richardson, who was better known as The Big Bopper and, unfortunately, was best known for dying in the same plane crash as Buddy Holly. In life Richardson was a talented and sensitive young man who had become a disc jockey, a performer, and a songwriter before his death at age twenty-nine. He gave this simple but potent song to his friend Johnny Preston, who eventually had a monster hit from it. Among the voices chanting in the background of the recording are country music legend George Jones and The Big Bopper himself. Richardson, Holly, and Ritchie Valens died on February 3, 1959. Although “Running Bear” was recorded in 1958, it was not released until August 1959, and after a slow start it ended up No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in January 1960.\n\nBack to Little Rock. Immediately after “Running Bear” peaked on the charts, the first-ever rock concert performed by Black entertainers to an integrated audience in Little Rock, Arkansas took place. According to investigative journalist Eric Lenaburg, when Jackie Wilson, Arthur Prysock, and Jesse Belvin took the stage the night of February 6, 1960, racists interrupted the show several times to walk through the audience and demand that white teenagers leave.\n\nHow many times do you think these same teenagers had listened to “Running Bear” and whispered about its coded lyrics in the weeks before the concert? How much do you think that song offended the racists who tried to make the young people leave?\n\nJesse Belvin, his wife, and their driver died as a result of a car crash after that concert. It is widely believed that someone tampered with their car, at least cutting the tires in a way that would encourage one or more blowouts once the vehicle was on the highway.\n\nJackie Wilson’s role in the concert. One fact Eric Lenaburg brought to light about the concert itself really startled me: Jesse Belvin, not Jackie Wilson, was the headliner. Why would a promoter have Mr. Excitement cede the stage to a balladeer? Jackie’s career was at its zenith. In the two years prior to this date, he had no fewer than six hits in the “Top Forty” (the AM deejay’s basic playlist) of the Billboard Hot 100, and two of those (“Lonely Teardrops” and “You Better Know It”) had reached #1 on Billboard’s Rhythm and Blues chart. No one was better suited to top the bill for an integrated audience. Furthermore, Jackie took pride in his stardom. Why would he agree to the lower billing?\n\nThe billing explained why Jackie Wilson was well on his way to Dallas when Jesse Belvin’s car crashed. If Jackie performed before Belvin did and was eager to leave Little Rock behind (as everyone performing that night probably was), he was free to leave earlier than Jesse and JoAnn.\n\nBut Mr. Excitement performing before Mr. Easy did not make sense . . . or did it? Jackie Wilson was a showstopper, the man promoters wanted doing the finale. That’s the reason he remained the headliner even in “oldies” revues for Murray the K and Dick Clark in the early 1970s.\n\nFurthermore, most entertainers did not like taking the stage after Jackie. The most famous emcee of the era, Gorgeous George, said that even Sam Cooke hated to follow Jackie because Jackie’s performances left the women in a state of frenzy.\n\nRecalling that anecdote about Sam Cooke jolted me into seeing the obvious regarding this particular concert: The last thing a promoter would want on that night was Jackie Wilson doing his Sleeping Stud variation on Sleeping Beauty (see Jackie at The Apollo) or feigning injury to induce women to run to his side to—uh—tend to his needs (see Teddy sees Jackie perform).\n\nOf course, there could have been some humdrum reason for getting Jackie Wilson on and off the stage earlier in the show. Maybe he was nursing an injury and didn’t want to do his knee drops and back bend splits. But it would take a substantial injury for promoters to know far enough in advance that Jackie could not “go all out.”\n\nIt seems more likely that from the beginning, there was an understanding that Jackie would refrain from doing his usual provocative stage show. It also seems the event was carefully planned.\n\nNow I have more questions than ever about this concert. Who had the idea to put Jesse Belvin in the headliner role? Which artist was first booked for the concert? Was the decision to make Jesse the top of the bill made from the outset, or were plans changed at some point?\n\nWhy even risk having Jackie Wilson on the bill? True, Jackie had huge drawing power at the time, but if you wanted this experiment in integration to go smoothly, why not just book a tamer act?\n\nAnd if the concert was planned carefully to forestall trouble, why were the performers’ cars left unprotected?\n\nWhat did Jackie perform that night? Did he stick mainly to ballads in lieu of the rockers?\n\nJesse was to perform in Dallas, too, of course. What was the billing supposed to be at that venue? Did the tour promoters expect trouble at more than one location? Did the Dallas concert take place, or was it canceled?\n\nHow much did Jackie and Jesse know in advance about possible problems in Little Rock? How seriously did Jackie and Jesse take the potential for violence?\n\nI hope someone who attended the Little Rock concert or the Dallas concert reads this and takes the time to get in touch. Even if you did not attend either, if you heard details from a source you consider reliable, perhaps a parent or grandparent who attended, what you know could help those of us interested in this event better understand what happened. I and others would really appreciate your efforts.\n\nAs I have said before, even memories of small details would be of interest most of all to Jesse Belvin Jr, who who lost his beautiful parents when he was only five years old.\n\nJackie Wilson was a “brown-eyed handsome man.” So were two of his good friends, Sam Cooke and Jesse Belvin. Owing to the nature of American racism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the southern states, brown-eyed handsome men in show business were at risk for harassment and bodily harm.\n\nAmerican racism has mutated decade by decade since World War II, manifesting itself differently over time. Most historians date the African American Civil Rights Movement from the mutilation/murder of Emmett Till in 1955 to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968. During these most turbulent and dangerous times, Jackie Wilson and his friends Sam Cooke and Jesse Belvin reached the peaks of their careers, and Sam Cooke and Jesse Belvin met their untimely deaths.\n\nEach of these men was making every possible effort to have his music “cross over” to white audiences, the people in America who had the money to buy the 45 rpm records rated on the Billboard Hot 100. By 1960, teenagers were a major segment of the record-buying public, and teenaged girls were the target market. The conventional wisdom was that boys spent their money maintaining their cars and paying for movies and burgers on dates while girls spent their money on clothes and records.\n\nSimultaneously, racists in the southern states were engaged in often violent efforts to discourage and retaliate against “race mixing” in public accommodations and schools. This resistance to integration in schools, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues was maintained to prevent the ultimate mixing of races, sexual intercourse between a white person and a Black person. Most abhorrent to these racists was the prospect of a Black male in intimate relations with a white female. This was The Great Taboo.\n\nThe Great Taboo and the potential for violence. Many of these racists considered rock and roll itself a danger. Asa Carter, head of the North Alabama Citizens Council, led a campaign to induce establishments with jukeboxes to purge recordings by Black artists. The April 18, 1956 issue of Time quotes Carter: “Rock and roll music is the basic, heavy-beat music of Negroes. It appeals to the base in man, brings out animalism and vulgarity.”\n\nSome of Carter’s associates in the Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy (one of many different organizations to use the KKK label) were averse even to the mild-mannered Nat “King” Cole singing love songs before an audience that included white women. They charged the stage and assaulted Cole at a 1956 performance in Birmingham, Alabama. Cole suffered a back injury during the beating and never again performed in southern states.\n\nCan you imagine how enraged such men would be at the thought that a white girl might take the place of the Black girl pictured above at a Jackie Wilson concert?\n\nThe rage racist white males felt at the thought of “their” women finding Black men attractive was a risk Jackie Wilson faced on every tour (see Bruised . . . and beaten?). That same rage may have been the root cause of Jesse Belvin’s death, which occurred after a concert Jackie and Jesse performed in Little Rock, Arkansas (see What happened in Arkansas?). The Little Rock concert was the first in that city to be performed to an integrated audience.\n\nChuck Berry’s song. The phrase brown-eyed handsome man, code for “irresistibly sexy Black man,” is the title of a brilliant song written by Chuck Berry. He recorded it in April 1956, and his record company released it as the flip side of “Too Much Monkey Business” in September of the same year. The lyrics touched on a range of stereotypes about Black men, including their athletic prowess and their likelihood of being arrested for things that were not and should not be crimes; however, the central focus of the song was how much a woman would do or endure to win or protect a brown-eyed handsome man.\n\nBrown-Eyed Handsome Man\n\n(Words and music by Chuck Berry)\n\nArrested on charges of unemployment\n\nHe was sittin’ in the witness stand\n\nThe judge’s wife told the district attorney\n\nShe said, “Free that brown-eyed man\n\nIf you want your job, you’d better free that brown-eyed man”\n\nFlyn’ across the desert in a TWA,\n\nI saw a woman walking ‘cross the sand\n\nShe been walkin’ thirty miles en route to Bombay\n\nTo meet a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nHer destination was a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nWay back in history three thousand years\n\nIn fact, ever since the world began\n\nThere’s been a whole lotta good women sheddin’ tears\n\nFor a brown eyed-handsome man\n\nA lot of trouble with a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nDutiful daughter couldn’t make up her mind\n\nBetween a doctor and a lawyer man\n\nHer mother told her “Darling, go out and find\n\nYourself a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nJust like your daddy, he’s a brown-eyed handsome man”\n\nMarlo Venus was a beautiful lass\n\nShe had the world in the palm of her hand\n\nShe lost both her arms in a rasselin’ match\n\nTo meet a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nShe fought an’ won herself a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nTwo, three, the count with nobody on\n\nHe hit a high fly into the stand\n\nRounded third, he was headed for home\n\nIt was a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nThat won the game, it was a brown-eyed handsome man\n\nCoded lyrics. This song, by the way, was later recorded by many artists in addition to Chuck Berry, among them Buddy Holly and Johnny Cash. Chuck Berry’s version is a subject of discussion on The Million Dollar Quartet tapes, where Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis can be heard trying to sing it and failing to get the lyrics straight. These tapes were recorded in November 1956, roughly two months after the record’s release, and the group’s interest in the song is worth noting—especially since it was a B-side that had become a hit only on the rhythm and blues (or “race”) charts.\n\nAll these artists understood the coded message of the song. Although it was not the only use of race in a pop song of that era, Berry’s song was an exceptionally daring combination of sexual and racial references. Note the comic reference to the Venus de Milo. All women, even ancient Greek women, fell under the spell of the brown-eyed handsome man. This was a song that encompassed what racists feared most, and it dealt lightly with the topic that was not supposed to be publicly discussed. Furthermore, the record had been released barely one year after the gruesome mutilation/murder of Emmett Till, the event in the national consciousness most associated with The Great Taboo.\n\nEmmett Till. For those of you who do not know this sickening event in American history, here are the basic facts. Emmett Till was a Chicago teenager visiting relatives in the small southern town of Money, Mississippi when, apparently because his companions dared him to do so, he flirtatiously whistled at a twenty-one-year-old white woman who was the proprietor of the store Emmett and his friends were leaving.\n\nThe fact that he and the other boys were leaving the store, plus the difference in age between Emmett, who had turned fourteen only the month before, and the woman, who must have seemed an old crone to the youths, would be enough to convince any intelligent person that Emmett was not attempting a serious advance on the woman.\n\nDays later, the woman’s husband and his brother seized Emmett from his uncle’s home and took him to another location. They knocked out his teeth, smashed his nose, gouged out one of his eyes, shot him in the head, weighted down his body, and dumped him in the Tallahatchie River.\n\nI was eight when Emmett Till was murdered. My parents were among the first working-class people we knew to invest in a television, which they valued for information as much as entertainment. They tuned in the early evening news every night, and although the news was not a “show” I liked, I sensed it was something important and watched it faithfully with my big sister and parents. I didn’t comprehend the significance of the news stories, but I learned to recognize the faces of famous people.\n\nEmmett Till became one of the most famous people in America. The picture of him shown on broadcasts had been taken the Christmas before his death. He was thirteen in the photo, but he looked younger—baby-faced, innocent, as lovely a child as had ever lived. The story mystified and frightened me.\n\nBy the time I went to college in 1965, The Great Taboo was a joke for most people in the northern states, but in the southern states change came about more slowly. Anti-miscegenation laws remained in some states until 1967, and when the laws went away, the attitudes did not always go away with them.\n\nFree that brown-eyed man! When Jackie Wilson and his drummer were arrested in a southern state on what was termed “morals charges” in 1968, the “crime” was that two Black males were in a hotel room with two white females. The youngest person in the room was twenty-four and all parties were present of their own consent. All together, now, let’s sing:\n\nArrested on charges of unemployment\n\nHe was sittin’ in the witness stand . . .\n\nThe nuisance arrest amounted to little in legal terms, but the resultant bad publicity helped propel Jackie into his marriage to Harlean Harris, an event which in turn set up the tragedy of his final years. (See Jackie Wilson Biography.)\n\nTo be continued . . .\n\nOne of the first posts in this blog was about the deaths of singer Jesse Belvin, his wife, Jo Ann, and their driver in a car crash after a concert in Little Rock. Jesse Belvin, only twenty-seven at the time, was handsome, talented, and on the verge of major stardom. He had already written hit records like “Earth Angel” for the Penguins, and he himself had a major hit a year earlier with “Guess Who,” a ballad he and Jo Ann wrote together.\n\nFirst post on Belvin. The original post introduced you to Jesse Belvin’s beautiful voice. Please check it out if you have not listened to him before. Like Jackie Wilson, Belvin did some of his best work with a full orchestra backing him. Not only did he have a great voice, but he was also a great interpreter of songs, especially love songs.\n\nThat post also recounted some of the questions that have bothered me over the years since Belvin’s death—questions about the concert, the widely different reports of it, Jackie Wilson’s involvement in the events, and the account Etta James gave in her autobiography, Rage to Survive.\n\nUntil I read the Etta James account, I suspected, as many others had, that foul play was involved in the deaths that night. I had read that the tires of the Belvin vehicle had been cut and that Jackie Wilson’s car, which left Little Rock before the Belvins departed, suffered flats on the way to Dallas that may have been caused by cuts. But James, who loved her friend Jesse Belvin dearly, seemed to put rumors to rest by stating unequivocally that the driver caused the crash by falling asleep. Still, I think many of us wonder what really happened.\n\nJesse Belvin Jr. Jesse Belvin’s son and namesake is also a singer. I particularly enjoy his rendition of “Fever.” Over on YouTube, I commented on a video of the recording the singer had posted, and he thanked me, adding that he liked my screen name, JackieWilsonLover, and telling me that Jackie Wilson had been a very dear friend to his father.\n\nThis thoughtful little statement made a deep impression on me. Yes, I reflected, I have wondered for many years what happened after the concert that night, but I am just a music fan. What must it have been like for the five-year-old boy that Jesse and Jo Ann left behind, growing to manhood in a racist society, wondering what really happened to his beautiful parents? I pray the day comes when Jesse Belvin Jr can have answers to the many questions he must have.\n\nI have been able to find answers to one or two of my questions, but even as some of my questions are answered, the most important ones are still there. Most of all, I wish that Jesse Belvin Jr could know more about what happened that night more than fifty years ago.\n\nLittle Rock and racism. A little more detail may be helpful here, particularly for readers who are not from the United States. At the beginning of the 1957 school year, Little Rock, a small town but the capital city of the state of Arkansas, was one of the best known cities in America.\n\nWhy? The governor of Arkansas, a man named Orville Faubus, stood in front of the doors of Central High School to bar African American students from entering the building. This was in direct defiance of a court order to enroll these students.\n\nPrior to this time in the southern United States, white students went to school only with other white students, while African American students, at that time called Negroes, attended their “own” very inferior schools. All the schools were public schools financed with tax dollars. The local governments that ran the schools kept the schools segregated until federal courts ordered integration.\n\nThis Arkansas “school desegregation case” is one of the best-known stories in the history of the American Civil Rights movement. It transformed Little Rock into a symbol of racism. In fact, for most Americans, racism remained the primary association with the state of Arkansas until Bill Clinton ran for President more than thirty years later.\n\nConcert. The event at which Jesse Belvin last sang took place February 6, 1960. Jackie Wilson and Arthur Prysock also appeared that night for what was to be the first rock concert performed in front of an integrated audience—not the two separate, segregated “dance concerts” that were mentioned in some accounts.\n\nBecause Jackie Wilson did appear at the concert, the old story that he refused to perform for a white audience is false.\n\nCar crash. The automobile in which the Belvins left Little Rock crashed on the highway passing the nearby town of Hope, which years later became famous as the hometown of Bill Clinton. Indeed, in his first presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was dubbed “The Man From Hope.”\n\nLocal newspapers reported that the Belvin vehicle collided head-on with a car carrying two white people who, like Jesse Belvin and his driver, died at the scene of the crash. Jo Ann Belvin was taken to a hospital where she soon succumbed to her massive injuries.\n\nDid you see the concert? If you attended the concert that night, please share what you remember of the evening. Anything remembered about the concert itself, even down to what the performers sang or did as part of their stage acts, whether they signed autographs, or how the audience reacted to their performances, helps complete the picture of that night. All his life, Jesse Belvin Jr has tried to learn as much as possible about the events surrounding the deaths of his parents. If describing what you saw and heard that night serves no other purpose, it is a way to let Jesse Belvin Jr know there are people who care about what happened to his parents—and people who care about him, a man whose lifelong memories of his mother and father must always be bittersweet.\n\nBefore I return to commenting on books written about Jackie Wilson, I want to say something more about the way America consumes information from and about entertainers.\n\nThe more I look at material on the Fifties and Sixties, the more I cringe. On the one hand, we have rich harvest of memoirs, biographies, appreciations, and criticism on, by, or about the recording artists of that period. However, the unspoken-but-guiding principle in composing these books seems to be “it’s only info-tainment,” that ugly term coined a decade or so ago to cover the “information + entertainment” fluff pieces about anything from the revelation of a talent show contestant’s arrest record to printing Mel Gibson’s mug shot to analyzing Kanye West’s drunken behavior at an awards banquet.\n\nThe Info-tainment Principle goes something like this: “Truth is of no consequence because entertainers are not really important people; in fact, even if they were, so what? Even the President of the United States can be misrepresented and ridiculed unfairly, as long as it’s about his private life—and particularly if it’s about his sex life.”\n\nCuriously, in the Fifties and Sixties, movie stars and other celebrities engaged in what were called “publicity stunts,” which were activities meant to help shape their images for the public, and their press agents concocted stories for gossip columnists as a way to further influence public opinion about their clients. Sometimes the objective was merely keeping the clients’ names in the public’s working memory. (Check this link for a sample of a press agent’s work, a story planted about Sam Cooke and Harlean Harris, the woman who would later become Jackie Wilson’s second wife.)\n\nYet, while all this fakery went on, “hard news” reporters worked to keep the facts straight, and biographers and critics went out of their way to prove or disprove certain events and widely-held beliefs about the big names of the entertainment industry.\n\nToday we have a curious partnership of falsehoods vying for our attention: The Info-tainment Principle entwines itself around old lies, the ones composed and distributed by press agents and the stars who recited lines written by press agents, creating even more complex works of fiction.\n\nFor example, both Doug Saint Carter in The Black Elvis: Jackie Wilson and Tony Douglas in Lonely Teardrops: The Jackie Wilson Story make use of an article printed in Musician magazine decades ago, an article that included extensive quotations from the late Dick Jacobs about his first interactions with Jackie Wilson. Both Carter and Douglas recycle the story as though it is an accurate account by Jacobs, although Jacobs is clearly offering a mere story, the work of press agents.\n\nIn the Musician article, Jacobs relates meeting with Jackie in order to determine how to write the arrangements for their first recording session together, which will include “Reet Petite” and “By the Light of the Silvery Moon.” He spills forth an elaborate yarn based on Jackie not being able to sing that day due to a severe cold and sore throat. Supposedly, each time Jacobs strikes some chords on the piano, Jackie signals that he wants the arrangement in a higher key. After Jacobs goes through what he describes as all the usual “male” keys and a number of the usual “female” keys, he excuses himself to go to another room to confer with the boss, Bob Thiele, about whether or not they’ve signed a “real singer.” The boss says it will probably be the only recording session they do with the kid, so let him have his way.\n\nExcuse me for groaning here, but these guys worked for Decca.\n\nAt the moment these two were supposedly having their despairing conversation over Jackie Wilson, Decca artists included Billy Ward and His Dominoes. Only the year before, just after coming to Decca from King/Federal, Billy Ward and His Dominoes scored a Top Twenty hit with “St. Therese of the Roses.” The lead singer on the recording was Jackie Wilson.\n\nBut this gets worse. Jacobs then describes how he hires the top session men in New York City to play on “Reet Petite.” (Sure, you pay for the best when you think you are going to scrap what you record.) And then Jacobs tells us that when they first heard Jackie sing, all the session men went slack-jawed in awe.\n\nOh, sure, they did. None of New York’s top session men had ever heard of Billy Ward and His Dominoes, a group that had become popular with its first lead tenor, Clyde McPhatter, and maintained its success when McPhatter gave way to Jackie Wilson, who sang the tenor leads for almost four years. It is simply amazing how ignorant of popular music those who manufacture it can be, isn’t it?\n\nLike compound interest reported on your bank statement, the balance in a “falsehoods account” increases when someone recycles a piece of fiction as though it were fact. Yet this process works comfortably alongside The Info-tainment Principle.\n\nAt least both Carter and Douglas realized that the famous Norm N Nite interview with Jackie Wilson was full of fiction. Jackie was never a Golden Gloves contestant, much less a champion, and of course the story of Jackie being shot while intervening in a fan’s attempted suicide was also a flawlessly recited fib. The lie, of course, had been devised to make a hero of Jackie in the midst of whatever the specific embarrassing reality was—probably that Jackie, a married man, was trying to keep one of his girlfriends, Juanita Jones, from shooting another of his girlfriends, Harlean Harris. (See Jackie Wilson Biography.)\n\nThe value of the Norm N Nite interview rests in hearing Jackie’s speaking voice and detecting his genuine enthusiasm for Elvis Presley and his late friend Sam Cooke. There is precious little truth in the whole audiotape. Maybe that’s why there were so few interviews with Jackie Wilson. The man obviously loved to laugh and smile. He probably couldn’t keep a straight face for interviewers.\n\nOnly three books have been written about Jackie Wilson, one by American Doug Saint Carter and two by Australian Tony Douglas. Douglas wrote two because he was obliged to withdraw the first from the market. Although I anticipate writing a number of posts about these books in the upcoming months, today I am merely introducing them.\n\nDoug Saint Carter’s book. Some Jackie Wilson fans despise Doug Saint Carter’s book for its title alone — The Black Elvis: Jackie Wilson. I have much in common with Carter, another devoted fan who is not a professional writer, who wrote his book from the same motivations that drive me to produce this blog: introducing Jackie Wilson to a younger generation of potential new fans, honoring this great artist’s achievements, and telling Jackie’s story within its context, American society and the entertainment industry in the Fifties and Sixties. I will argue that although this book has flaws, its writer respects both his subject and his readers and delivers on his promises.\n\nTony Douglas’s books. The Tony Douglas books are a very different matter. He promises the comprehensive biography of Jackie Wilson, and while the books are chock full of information, they are untrustworthy, badly organized, and highly problematic overall. At the time he wrote them, Douglas was a former journalist and manager of a bar in Thailand. Whatever his motives for writing them, he obscures at least as much truth as he reveals. Worse yet, he approaches both his readers and Jackie Wilson with utter contempt, manipulating his audience and Jackie’s life to create a monster and a set of victims, all the while concentrating on the most salacious details of any available fact or rumor.\n\nDouglas did not know much about American culture, which no doubt accounts for some of his misinterpretations. He was also disadvantaged because a number of major figures in Wilson’s life would not cooperate with him and because a few of his sources actually manipulated him, rather than the other way around.\n\nOn the positive side, Douglas was able to secure interviews with Billy Ward, Billy Davis, and Carl Davis, all of whom have now passed away. Although Douglas did not make the best use of all those opportunities, these men were friends as well as Wilson’s professional associates, so their information and insight are valuable to Jackie Wilson fans.\n\nDouglas also had conversations with Lynn Crochet and Joyce McRae (Moore), although his treatment of both these women is abominable.\n\nThe first Douglas book was entitled Jackie Wilson: The Man, the Music, the Mob (2001). It meandered, lacked an index, and was, overall, tacky. By the time he composed the second book, Jackie Wilson: Lonely Teardrops (2005), Douglas had moved away from any compassion for Jackie Wilson whatever and settled on what must have looked like a marketable formula: sex and drugs (forget the rock and roll).\n\nThe women who “loved” Jackie. Douglas audaciously declared Freda Hood Wilson, Lynn Ciccone, and Lynn Crochet to be “the women who loved Jackie Wilson” in the book’s dedication. He then let the first two of those three women establish the narrative for much of the second book. Judging by Douglas’s treatment of Crochet, I am convinced he would have just omitted her from his list if he could have gotten away with it, but it’s rather hard to hide the inconvenient fact that Crochet and Wilson loved each other and had been committed to each other for years at the time Wilson was stricken. (See Jackie Wilson Biography.)\n\nFreda Hood Wilson was Jackie Wilson’s first wife, a woman Jackie married when he was sixteen and while, according to Freda as Douglas quotes her, Jackie was drunk. She and her father had to go looking for him when he failed to show up at their house for the ceremony, which had been arranged with borrowed identification for Jackie because his mother would not give permission for her minor son to marry Freda. Of course, this is just the delightful Freda’s recollection, so who knows? By the time Douglas conducted his extensive interviews with her, Freda had been a frequently non-functioning alcoholic for more than twenty years and, to say the least, was of questionable mental capacity.\n\nFor part of Freda’s interviews with Douglas, Freda and Jackie’s oldest child (she had many names but just I think of her as “Denise, the Daughter from Hell”) joined her mother, contributing her own litany of Jackie Wilson’s failures. No assertion either woman made elicited editorial comment from Douglas, no matter how absurd it was or how easily simple arithmetic would undermine it.\n\nLynn Ciccone, who must definitely not be confused with Lynn Crochet, was not married to Jackie Wilson. Lynn Ciccone was a woman married to another man when she introduced herself to Wilson by enclosing her photo in a lengthy letter that resulted in a tryst with him. She continued an off-and-on affair with Wilson for several years, giving birth to a daughter he fathered while she compiled notes for a tell-all book that no one wanted to publish. She ultimately turned the manuscript over to Douglas for a chance at a starring role in his book. Ciccone, by the way, did not tell her daughter that Wilson was the girl’s father, or even tell the child that she was half African American, until Wilson was incapacitated.\n\nDouglas also interviewed this daughter, who, in the midst of her assertion that Jackie Wilson treated her mother badly, accidentally provides a glimpse of Wilson as a father (who was, of course, not allowed to be known as her father). Despite all her complaining, the incidents Ciccone’s offspring recalls from childhood visits with Wilson on the road serve only to make Jackie Wilson look like, well, a normal and loving old-fashioned daddy.\n\nOne day Jackie babysits her alone and plays a children’s card game with her. On another occasion, the girl assumes Wilson is asleep and kicks her mother, only to have Jackie leap off the bed, spank her, and admonish her (“Never again, got it?”). On another visit she refuses to eat, so he pulls her onto his lap and feeds her from his own plate, employing the old “into the mouth and over the gum, down to the tummy, yum yum yum” line again and again, giving her a kiss each time she swallows a mouthful. At age seven she is hanging out on the stage with him during rehearsal and breaks a leg while trying to imitate one of his famous moves. Here she acknowledges that he is the first person to her aid, holding her and comforting her while barking orders to get her needed medical attention.\n\nWhat love is and is not. Front and center, page after page, Douglas foists the egos and animosities of these women on the reader to establish an image of Jackie Wilson as self-centered, selfish, vain, violent, irresponsible, and not much else. Douglas never seems to realize that readers know what love is and what love is not. Love is NOT grabbing your ten minutes of fame by trashing the man you just claimed to love.\n\nBut more on the Douglas books later. My next posts on these books will be on Doug Saint Carter’s The Black Elvis: Jackie Wilson.\n\nThe popular music showcase Shindig! aired for only two seasons on American television, yet it rivaled The Ed Sullivan Show as best video venue for recording artists in the Sixties. Although the show was “prerecorded” (taped before a live audience several hours before it was broadcast), the performances were not lip synchronizations: even when backing instrumentals were on tape, singers sang LIVE. Jackie Wilson, of course, ate that challenge for breakfast.\n\nJackie Wilson appeared on four episodes of the program, and decades later, when the episodes were packaged into videocassettes and marketed as nostalgia items, Rhino chunked them into categories such as “British Invasion” or “Motown.” However, one cassette alone was devoted to the standout performances of Jackie Wilson.\n\nReviews for Shindig! Presents Jackie Wilson on the Amazon site suggest just how high the overall quality of Jackie’s performances are. Most quibbles are on the quality of the original camera work: Camera operators were frequently several steps behind Jackie’s moves, and there are too many cuts to dancers and audiences. My personal problem is having the credits running on the finale numbers. Surely they had tape available that did not have this nonsense incorporated.\n\nNowadays few of us are in the market for VHS, and if you are, you have to pay way too much for this one, which is now a collectors’ item. It would be sporting of Rhino to provide us with a DVD. But I am not holding my breath for that possibility, particularly because all the episodes are available on YouTube. So, with thanks to the YouTubers who uploaded them, here follows a compendium of Jackie Wilson Shindig! performances.\n\nGospel vibe. Jackie first appeared on Episode #6, which aired October 21, 1964. He performed “She’s Alright,” the gospel-sounding tribute to a devoted female, complete with knee drop to act out the woman attending to his “fevah.” The Chambers Brothers, then primarily gospel singers who were another year away from being a “known” act, provided serious backup vocals for Jackie:\n\nStage wardrobe changes creep in. Note that on this first Shindig! appearance Jackie still dresses in the classy wardrobe that has thus far been a trademark: perfectly fitted “natural sharkskin” (silk+mohair) suits, silk shirts, ties. For the first number he wears a black suit, white shirt, and bow tie; for the finale, he reverses the monochromatic scheme to white suit and black shirt, and uncharacteristically sports an open collar. The scruffy physical appearances of British Invasion bands are starting to pressure Black American performers into more casual stage apparel. In this woman’s opinion, it was a definite turn for the worse.\n\nMost Shindig! episodes concluded with lively finales that brought many of the evening’s performers back on the stage. For this program, Jackie lets loose with “Baby Workout,” joined first by The Blossoms and The Chambers Brothers, then dancers and everyone else. Notice Jackie employing the boxer’s rope skipping motion as he implores everyone to “C’mon and turn the joint out.” I wish he would have landed a punch on that obnoxious camera-hog blonde bimbo who kept getting too close to him, but every wish can’t be granted, I suppose.\n\nJackie’s next Shindig! appearance was Episode #28, which aired on March 24, 1965. Jackie has been convinced to begin the show dressed in a pullover sweater over an open-neck shirt. Thank goodness his trousers are from one of those yummy suits.\n\nThe integrative duet medley. In an unusual move, the Shindig! team has asked Jackie to sing a duet with Shirley Ellis (“You’re Gonna Mess Up A Good Thing”) interspersed with a duet by a white couple, Dick and DeeDee (“Be My Baby”). The point may be lost on a current generation of viewers, so I will spell it out: Jackie and Shirley move across the set to symbolically “integrate” the microphone Dick and DeeDee are using. They are, of course, graciously welcomed, symbolic of how the world of musical entertainment is far ahead of the rest of American society in terms of racial equality. It does, however, appear that the foursome works hard to avoid actually touching each other in close quarters.\n\nIn terms of talent, Dick and DeeDee are obviously seriously outclassed by Jackie and Shirley. Near the end (around 4:00), Dick shrieks, and Jackie blinks to stifle a wince. How pathetic to even try for that sound in the presence of Jackie Wilson!\n\nPutting aside the humor of juxtaposing these two pairs of singers, or this pair of singers and that other pair of hit makers, Jackie’s interpretation of his share of the duet with Shirley Ellis is marvelous. As the partner caught cheating in the song, his facial expressions run the range of feigned shock, false innocence, mock righteousness, flirtatious pleading, ominous pouting, and sheer lasciviousness. The man really should have had the opportunity to act in films.\n\nNOTE: There is currently no video available for this performance.]\n\n“Danny Boy.” Mid-show, Jackie performed a gob-smacking live rendition of “Danny Boy,” which Darlene Love introduced with a haunting few bars. You can read an analysis of the high notes of this performance here.\n\n[NOTE: I am sorry that to say that the video I linked to originally has been removed from YouTube due to an account closing. You can see the same footage here, though, it you go to the 4:50 mark.]\n\nBringing the cast onstage. Late in the show, Jackie re-appears to perform “Sing (And Tell the Blues So Long).” You will have to look for the song at roughly the 2:00 mark. He has shed the sweater for a black open-neck shirt and the jacket that matches those elegant and carefully fitted white sharkskin trousers. The ending of the song is also fitted—with callouts for Darlene, Fanita, and Jean of The Blossoms and most of the remaining featured participants from the show, including a very young Glen Campbell and Delaney Bramlett. Look for the point with the iconic Jackie Wilson gesture, the removal of his jacket, which he flings over his shoulder.\n\nWhitall, Susan and Kevin John. Fever: Little Willie John’s Fast Life, Mysterious Death, and the Birth of Soul. Titan Books, 2011.\n\nToday’s post looks into a book that introduces you to a forefather of soul music, a singer possessed of a tenor voice with easy top notes unmatched in the history of popular music, a showman of such riveting stage presence that no one dared to take the floor once he had performed, a man so devastatingly attractive that women could not control themselves around him. When he took the stage, panties rained down on him.\n\nLet’s pause and take a look at the photo above, a snapshot of some guys hanging out together one day in Detroit. The man is right there in the picture.\n\nDid you pick the one in the white jacket? Silly you.\n\nWho are the authors kidding? On my first read through, I had the eerie suspicion that Susan Whitall’s original manuscript had been about Jackie Wilson. I envision Whitall listening quietly as Kevin John (one of Willie’s sons) and the rest of the John family ask her to write a book about their patriarch. Later, alone behind the computer in her study, she executes several find-and-replace operations on a lengthy document, expunging the Jackies and Wilsons and inserting Willies and Johns in their places. In the final stage of my vision, Whitall has a moment of inspiration, smiles, and scrolls through the manuscript to locate a minor character of limited talent, one who shrinks in awe at the entrance of the protagonist. Deftly, she obliterates that character’s first name, then surname, replacing them with Jackie and Wilson.\n\nThe authors of this book have essentially reversed the positions Jackie Wilson and Willie John hold in terms of talent, achievements, and significance to popular music history. Apparently they think no one will notice because Jackie Wilson’s aging fan base is rapidly dying off and music writers still find Jackie’s story too scary to handle.\n\nThe book. Fever is a book about the life and career of William Edward John, known publicly as Little Willie John, who died of a heart attack or pneumonia or both at the age of thirty in Washington State Penitentiary (Walla Walla, Washington), where he was serving a sentence for knifing a man to death. Watch the authors of this book on this local television station interview, and you will see that I do not exaggerate the extent of the outlandish claims they make for John. They say John is the link between Black music of the Forties and Motown. Yes, they actually say that, and they say it flying in the face of these facts:\n\n→ Jackie Wilson recorded and performed in all the major popular music forms except jazz;\n\n→ Jackie Wilson charted blues, rock, pop, and ballads on the main Billboard Top Twenty, not merely the R and B charts, where he was even more successful;\n\n→ Jackie Wilson placed a total of twenty-four hits in the Top Forty in the same years Willie John recorded;\n\n→ Motown’s founder, Berry Gordy Jr, wrote or co-wrote five of the first hits of Jackie Wilson’s solo career;\n\n→ Berry Gordy Jr started Motown with the royalties he earned from Jackie Wilson’s first hits.\n\nAnd listen carefully as Susan Whitall relates how the man who prosecuted the case against Willie John told her that John should have gotten off because his lawyer did such a terrible job of defending him. If you ARE listening carefully, you will realize that the man did not say that Willie was innocent. He merely said a sharp lawyer would have gotten him off.\n\nHit recordings. John recorded for the King label in the Fifties and early Sixties. He had repeated successes on the rhythm and blues charts and more modest successes on the pop charts, including two records that penetrated the Top Twenty, “Talk to Me, Talk to Me” in 1958 and “Sleep” in 1960. Another song associated with Willie John and considered an excellent illustration of his vocal style is my personal favorite among his recordings, “Let Them Talk.”\n\nHis signature song, however, is “Fever,” the slow and sultry ballad virtually everyone associates with Peggy Lee. John’s original rendition is better, and if you listen to the recordings one after the other, you must acknowledge how much Lee’s record is a copy, another manifestation of the marketing strategy that gave us Georgia Gibbs singing LaVern Baker’s “Tweedle Dee” and Pat Boone singing Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti.”\n\nBut let’s face it, how mesmerizing is the power of your voice if you are an African American male and, upon hearing the title of your signature song, ninety-nine percent of the music-listening public conjures up the image of a buxom Caucasian woman with platinum blonde hair?\n\nFrankly, I would have called the book Let Them Talk.\n\nWillie John was talented, and unlike most of his contemporaries, he had the benefit of early vocal training. The man could sing. Really sing. However, the book seriously overstates both his achievements and his rightful place in popular music history.\n\nRe-making Willie’s image. Prior to publication of this book, Willie John, an alcoholic known for his quick temper and big mouth, had one of the uglier images in pop music history. Yet, if your only knowledge of John were this book, you might well find yourself amazed that anyone could think such an innocent and playful spirit, a devoted family man, could be accused of a crime just because he was at a party sitting next to a guy who was mysteriously stabbed to death.\n\nOne of the more comic aspects of the book is the extent to which the authors conceal or airbrush truth in their quest to aggrandize Willie and repaint his facade. For example, Faye Pridgeon, as her surname is usually spelled (it’s spelled “Pridgon” throughout my ebook copy), was the most famous groupie to haunt the Apollo Theater. For years she boasted that Willie John fathered the first of her illegitimate children, but that is not covered in this book.\n\nInstead, Pridgeon is called upon to place Willie in the select company of the two most famous of her other many lovers, Sam Cooke and Jimi Hendrix, and to assure us that Sam Moore is a liar for saying that Willie introduced him to heroin. And, oh, yes, she speaks to us of how sensitive and reticent Willie was.\n\nTrashing Jackie Wilson. The particular way Jackie Wilson is targeted in the book does more to underscore the weakness of the authors’ claims for Willie John than it does to diminish Jackie Wilson. Personally, I found myself saying, “Not so fast. It’s still too early to assume that no one remembers these times.”\n\nFor instance, the authors think they will convince readers that John had a superior voice or was a better singer by saying that Willie “didn’t have to jump up” like Jackie did. When I come to ridiculous lines like that, my concentration breaks, and all empathy I have built up for Willie John evaporates while I focus on the lameness of this tactic. The writers would have done better to leave Jackie Wilson’s name out of the book than to try to convince anyone who had heard both singers that Wilson was the lesser talent.\n\nThe Johns. The John family had and retains many contacts in the music industry. One of the Johns was a backup singer for Stevie Wonder for years. (Wonder provided a foreword for the book.) Willie John’s older sister was an early Raelette (one of a group of female backup singers working with Ray Charles). The Johns have known the right people and the music press for generations. They should be commended for having the smarts to hold off on this project until a goodly number of people passed away and little evidence survived to contradict some of the book’s more outlandish claims.\n\nBut I will not forgive them for unnecessarily trashing Jackie Wilson. They are confident their fiction will go unchallenged because music writers will not touch Jackie’s story and Jackie does not have a family capable and willing to defend him.\n\nThe strategy may work in the long run. It is a shame that the John family took the low road with this book. Willie John was a very talented man who left some terrific recordings to us. His memory would be better served by a realistic assessment of his place in popular music history and a book that did not insult its readers.\n\nHowever, within another decade the Johns will probably have the last laugh. No one will be alive who remembers Jackie Wilson, and Wilson’s story will remain untold, yet their book will be available to establish Willie John as the major figure in Black music history “between the Forties and Motown.”\n\nPendergrass, Teddy, and Patricia Romanowsky. Truly Blessed. New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1998.\n\nThe story of a thirteen-year-old Teddy Pendergrass sneaking into a concert at Philadelphia’s famed Uptown Theater became a staple in interviews about his autobiography, Truly Blessed.\n\nTeddy decided to become a singer in the time it took him to watch one act, the extraordinary stage performance of one of the most popular recording stars of the day. The performer? You guessed it: Jackie Wilson.\n\nSuddenly, the music came up, the spotlight hit the stage, and out strode the magnificent Jackie Wilson. I’ll never forget it: He was so clean in his tailored suit and tie, revealingly tight pants, and a fresh, perfectly sculpted ‘do. The Uptown erupted in cheers and screams as he grabbed the microphone and launched into his show. Whatever Jackie sang—it could have been his latest hit, “Baby Workout,” or “Night,” or “Lonely Teardrops,” or “Reet Petite”—he gripped the audience in the palm of his hand. He could croon as beautifully as Sam Cooke, shout as loud as James Brown, and move like nobody else. A former Golden Gloves champion, Jackie demonstrated an athletic grace as he executed a series of seemingly effortless splits, spins, drops, and steps so smooth that he glided across that stage as if it were polished glass. There was only one word for Jackie in his prime, and that was “electric.”\n\nGirls and women rushed the stage, screaming and reaching out for him. Security guards manned a barricade that created ten feet of no-man’s-land between the front row of seats and the stage, so that no one got close enough to touch Jackie, no matter how close to the edge he danced. Still, his every glance, every note, every move teased the fans into a wilder frenzy. The female reaction was nothing less than pure hysteria, and Jackie reveled in it.\n\nSuddenly Jackie dropped to the floor and slowly rolled off the stage. Of course, this part of his act was staged, but we didn’t know that, so when he toppled off the stage and landed hard on the theater floor, everyone gasped and stood up, craning to see. Then we all rushed down the aisle, certain that Jackie had been injured.\n\nLying on his back, he seemed hurt, but I saw him gesture to a guard to let a girl through the barrier. She fell upon him, wrapped her legs around his hips, and started rubbing her body against him. He was clearly enjoying it. From where I stood, I could have sworn they were actually making love as a throng of screaming, reaching women surrounded them. To say I couldn’t believe my eyes barely begins to describe my reaction, an unfamiliar mix of awe, amazement, and envy. On the one hand, I couldn’t believe Jackie was getting away with this: He’s really having sex on the floor of the Uptown! I thought. Man, I’ve gotta find a way to do this! If I had to name a single event that convinced me to become a singer, this was it.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a transcript of a National Public Radio interview promoting the book, Truly Blessed. The interview was conducted by Terry Gross on the program Fresh Air, originally broadcast on October 14, 1998 on WHYY (public radio).*\n\nTEDDY PENDERGRASS: And I saw, got a chance to see Jackie Wilson…\n\nTERRY GROSS: Yeah, you said…\n\nPENDERGRASS: That changed my life…\n\nGROSS: It really changed you.\n\nPENDERGRASS: It changed my life around, so it was…\n\nGROSS: What was it about the Jackie Wilson performance that…?\n\nPENDERGRASS: Just a consummate performance. I mean, just my image of him was just so huge, and he just controlled that stage. His audience was in the palm of his hands, and as I say in the book, you know, the ladies ran down to the front of the stage when they thought he had fell off to hurt himself. He had just rolled off intentionally and rolled off onto the floor, and to see the ladies run through the guardrails and just lay on top of him and appear to make mad, passionate love to him in the middle of the floor at whatever time it was that morning, to me it was just, my jaws dropped. My God…\n\nGROSS: How can I do that?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nPENDERGRASS: Right. That’s what I want to do.\n\nJackie Wilson had a way with “getting away with” outrageous stage behavior. Read more in Doug Henderson’s account of a show at Harlem’s Apollo Theater and in my post about Jackie’s skill at pushing the limits on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\n*Interview available at http://www.wbur.org/npr/122575226/in-memoriam-soul-icon-teddy-pendergrass\n\nOne marvelous bit of fun available on YouTube is this clip of Jackie Wilson and and his good friend Sam Cooke, who is supposed to be performing a lip synchronization of his recording “Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha.”\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of comments on YouTube about the video segment. Most of them are remarks about how wonderful it is that someone preserved this light-hearted moment between two of the greatest singers in history, how handsome they both are, how enormously talented they were, and how tragic that both their careers ended so much too soon.\n\nWhat’s going on in the video. Some comments, however, indicate serious misunderstanding of what is happening. Some younger viewers think this video has another, “original” track, that it’s a video of a live performance, or that the video was made to deliberately mislead people.\n\nIn truth, when the camera light came on, Sam Cooke assumed he was just doing another day’s work, performing a routine task for a Sixties recording artist on tour: stop by the local television station, maybe record a brief interview, and make a lip synchronization video of your recent hit in the setting of the local teen dance party show. Only this time, Sam’s good friend caught him by surprise and provided a lesson in the cha cha cha.\n\nThe history of this video is covered in a book. The venue was Memphis, and the local television program was Talent Party. George Klein, who became host of the show in 1964, has written a book entitled Elvis, My Best Man: Radio Days, Rock ‘n’ Roll Nights, and My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presley, and one of the chapters is about Klein hosting Talent Party, a gig he landed with a little help from Elvis.\n\nThe program had at one point been a typical sort of local version of American Bandstand, but according to Klein, the station decided to stop having teenagers dance on the show due to fear that whites and Blacks would start dancing together on live television.\n\nI am skeptical about some of the facts given in this excerpt, but I will reserve my comments and questions until you have the chance to read it.\n\nOne of my favorite Talent Party moments occurred in my first year as host, when, with the help of Wink Martindale, I got Sam Cooke booked to do the show. He was coming through Memphis as part of a co-headlining tour with Jackie Wilson, in which they’d take turns city-by-city as to who opened and who closed that night’s show. I’d met Sam before at a show at Ellis [Auditorium], and we got along well enough that I decided to ask him for a favor: I wondered if he’d invite Jackie Wilson to come along with us. Sam did, and Jackie said yes, though Sam gave me a firm warning: “Jackie loves the ladies, and if you don’t lead him by the hand out of here after the show, you can forget about seeing him again tonight.”\n\nI worked hard to get them both to the studio quickly after the show, and couldn’t wait to shoot a couple songs each with such great talents. But as Sam was doing a practice take of his song “Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha,” I noticed that Jackie was mouthing along with every word and I got an idea.\n\n“Jackie, you really know Sam’s stuff,” I said.\n\n“Man, we’re like brothers. I know everything he’s ever done.”\n\n“Well, tell me what you think of this. When we start really shooting this one, why don’t you sneak around back, and when Sam’s done with the first verse, you pop through the curtains and take over the song.”\n\nJackie loved the idea, and while he certainly surprised the heck out of Sam, Sam loved it too, and they were both having a ball as they tried to match each other line for line and dance move for dance move. Footage of the magical moment is still out there on the Internet, and you can’t help but smile when you see the smiles on their faces.\n\nThe date of the video. So here is my problem: I have trouble believing that this clip is from 1964. The date “1960” appears at the conclusion of the clip, and that makes sense, as Jackie and Sam were definitely touring the South together that year.\n\nThe date “1964” does not make sense. “Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha” was a hit in 1959, when it reached position #31 on the Billboard Hot Hundred. Between the success of “Cha Cha Cha” and 1964, Sam Cooke placed fifteen hits on that same chart, and ten of those were in the coveted Top Twenty. Why would he be making a lip synch clip for an old song that was a lesser hit? The record business then was about selling what was current. Artists promoted the vinyl available in the record stores.\n\nKlein’s claim. Well, what if the correct date is 1960, and 1964 is just a typographical error in the book, or perhaps a mental slip of the author’s memory? Sorry, but neither of those explanations work. Klein took over the show in 1964, and his book makes the claim that he integrated the program that year, putting on the program’s first Black artist, Fats Domino. I’m not certain of many things in life, but I think both Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke were African Americans. If Klein’s claim to integrating Talent Party was to hold up, he had to explain away a video that was available on the Internet at the time his book was being published.\n\nSo the issue becomes this: did Klein make up his part in producing this historic video clip, or is his account accurate? His position would be bolstered if Sam and Jackie toured the South together again in 1964. I do not happen to know that they did that, but maybe someone reading this will know.\n\nThere would still be, however, the awkward matter of the date at the end of the video segment.\n\nIs the history of American music “real” history? Why am I making a fuss about this? After all, isn’t it just a bit of “infotainment”?\n\nFor me, no. I take the history of music seriously, particularly the history of American popular music of the Fifties and Sixties, when badly exploited Black artists did so much to raise the consciousness of young white teenagers about racism.\n\nJackie Wilson and Sam Cooke were not only two massively talented, hard-working men who created great music: they were also flesh-and-blood human beings living in a land where success was segregated and a second-class experience for them, two singers every bit as great and arguably better than Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley. We owe it to what they achieved and to their memories to get their stories straight.\n\nDoes anyone reading this know if Sam and Jackie toured together again in 1964? Does anyone reading this have any further information on the making of this wonderful video clip?"
