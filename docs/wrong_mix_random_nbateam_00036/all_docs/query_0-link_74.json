His first recording, “Rocket 88”, credited to “Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats”, in 1951 is considered a contender for “first rock and roll song”. Relocating to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1954, he built the Kings into one of the most renowned acts on the local club circuit. There he met singer Anna Mae Bullock, whom he renamed Tina Turner, forming the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which over the course of the sixties became a soul/rock crossover success. In July 1960, “A Fool in Love” was released under the billing ‘Ike & Tina Turner’ and later became a national hit, selling a million copies and making the duo national stars. Turner added a backing girl group he renamed the Ikettes, and this also led to the first name change of the Kings of Rhythm as they began performing as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.

They released their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. on Columbia Records in October 1964. It was not a critical or commercial success, and the duo split. The next year, producer Tom Wilson lifted the song “The Sound of Silence” from the record, dubbed an electric backing onto it, and released it as a single that went to number one on the Billboard pop charts. Simon had gone to England in 1965 after the initial failure of Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., to pursue a solo career. He briefly teamed with songwriter Bruce Woodley of The Seekers.

Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His relatively short career is described by AllMusic as “enormously influential” for country and rock, “blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.” His posthumous honors include the Americana Music Association “President’s Award” for 2003, and a ranking at No. 87 on Rolling Stone’s list of the “100 Greatest Artists of All Time.”\n\nPeter Noone 1947 – is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist and actor, best known as Herman of the successful 1960s pop group Herman’s Hermits.

Singer and multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson named Partridge one of his favourite songwriters of all time: “What I love about Andy’s music is that every song he writes has a very strong concept or idea behind it. He’s not just rattling off love songs or songs about how lonely he is. Every song has a little twist to it, and it’s so clever, so smart.”\n\nDeaths :\n\nBerry Oakley 1972 (b.1948) – was an American bassist and one of the founding members of the Allman Brothers Band. He is ranked number 46 on Bass Player magazine’s list of “The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time”. Oakley was known for his long, melodic bass runs that formed a throbbing foundation underneath Allman and Betts’ furious guitar solos and jams. “In Memory of Elizabeth Reed”, “Mountain Jam” and “Whipping Post” from the live album At Fillmore East capture Oakley at his best. Oakley was also the band member most involved in establishing domestic unity among the band’s extended family. When Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, Oakley was devastated. On November 11, 1972, Oakley was involved in a motorcycle accident which caused his death in Macon, Georgia, just three blocks from where Duane Allman had his fatal motorcycle accident the year before. Coincidentally, both Allman and Oakley were both 24 when they died.\n\nPhil Taylor 2015 (b.1954) – better known as Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor, was an English rock drummer in the English rock band Motörhead from 1975–1984 and 1987–1992 recording eleven studio albums and four live albums, including No Sleep ’til Hammersmith and Nö Sleep at All, between them. The Motörhead line-up consisting of Lemmy, “Fast” Eddie Clarke and Taylor are considered the ‘classic’ line-up of the band.\n\nNovember 12\n\nBirthdays :\n\nBrian Hyland 1943 – is an American pop recording artist who was particularly successful during the early 1960’s.

Hyland’s other major hit during this period was 1962’s “Sealed with a Kiss”, which reached #3 in 1962 on both the American and UK Singles Chart.\n\nJohn Walker 1943 (d.2011) – was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known as the founder of The Walker Brothers, who had their greatest success in the 1960’s, particularly in the United Kingdom."
