        "text": "New Music, Religion, Anchorman, His Metal Grammy And More With Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson\n\nWhat an honor to talk to rock royalty. Jethro Tull‘s Ian Anderson is on Talkin’ Rock to discuss the latest album and more around his life and Jethro Tull.\n\nThe latest album is called RökFlöte and is out now. That bring said, Ian talked about an idea he got in early 2023 for the next album already. “My resolve is to work during this year to get that ready for rehearsal and recording in January and February of next year.”\n\nHe talked about touring and making up dates after the pandemic. “I tried not to think about it too much.” as far as if he missed playing live and touring during the lockdowns.\n\nWe got into some spiritual talk. He told me about studying religions and attending different masses. “I rather like the unknowable.” he said about what lies beyond here.\n\nI asked him about the term “prog rock”. He said he preferred the term Progressive Rock. He dove into that much more.\n\nWhat about that scene in Anchorman, where Will Ferrell was playing the flute in the jazz club? He brought up that he thought Fox TV anchorman Tony Snow had more to do with that scene than he did.\n\nLastly, I asked him where his Metal Grammy is….that’s a fun story.\n\nJethro Tull’s Ian Anderson, on Talkin’ Rock!\n\nEnjoy the conversation.\n\n-Meltdown-\n\nEric Clapton: His 50 Best Solo Songs, Ranked\n\nEric Clapton was a legend and one of rock’s greatest guitarists before he ever started making solo records. His albums with the Yardbirds, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, Cream and Blind Faith influenced generations of guitarists (as did his work with Derek & the Dominoes — but their album came after Clapton’s debut album).\n\nWe’re celebrating his solo catalog, as well as a few collaborative efforts with a few other legends. From Eric Clapton to Happy Xmas, here are our favorite E.C. solo jams.\n\nThe Latest on Eric Clapton\n\nClapton was one of dozens of guitarists to take part in a new all-star recording helmed by Mark Knopfler.\n\nAs previously reported, Knopfler recruited a star-studded lineup of fellow guitarists for a charity single benefitting Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America.\n\nThe charity single is a new recording of “Going Home.” The track is an instrumental featured on the 1983 score for the film Local Hero, which also served as the film’s theme. Knopfler wrote the entire score of the film, which is considered his debut solo album and debut soundtrack album.\n\n“Going Home” can be heard in its entirety below. Fans can purchase/download the song in a variety of formats at MarkKnopflersGuitarHeroes.com.\n\nThe re-recording of “Going Home” is billed as being by Mark Knopfler’s Guitar Heroes. Among those heroes was Jeff Beck, who died suddenly in January 2023 at age 78 from bacterial meningitis. According to a press release, Beck’s contribution to the track is also the guitar icon’s final recording.\n\nKnopfler said, in part, of Beck, ” … Jeff Beck’s contribution arrived and that was spellbinding. I think what we’ve had is an embarrassment of riches, really.”\n\nBeck, of course, was a close friend of Clapton’s. In fact, Clapton and Beck’s widow, Sandra, were the ones to organize a grand tribute concert honoring the late guitar icon back in May 2023.\n\nMeltdown started on the mighty WRIF on the evening of Halloween, 1995. Technically, his first on-air shift was the morning of November 1st. Moving to the Motor City from Buffalo, N.Y., he has built a career and family. Over his almost three-decade stint at RIFF, he's had the privilege to work with some of the biggest personalities in Detroit radio history. He boasts of being just the second-afternoon drive jock in the station's illustrious 53-year history. Along with his love for rock music and attending concerts, he's also an avid Harley-Davidson enthusiast and hockey player. He plays year-round and manages to squeeze in a few charity games throughout the year. Meltdown writes about the Detroit Red Wings, rock music, and Detroit concert venues.\n\nSign me up for the 101 WRIF Cybercrew email newsletter!\n\nJoin the 101 WRIF Cybercrew to get everything that rocks sent right to your inbox from The Riff!
