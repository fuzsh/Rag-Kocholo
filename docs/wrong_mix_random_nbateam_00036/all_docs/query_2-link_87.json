        "text": "“They are Jerry’s kindred spirits when it comes to making music.”\n\n“The Garcia Project is a must-see for anyone who had the good fortune of seeing Jerry’s band live. I was lucky enough to share the JGB experience with Jerry, John Kahn, Maria Muldaur, Keith and Donna. Being on stage with Mik, Kat, Dan and the crew is the closest thing to the original. They are Jerry’s kindred spirits when it comes to making music. Even if you never saw JGB live, you can see and hear their spirit at a Garcia Project performance.” – Buzz Buchanan, Drummer for The Jerry Garcia Band 1977-1978\n\nMik Bondy – Guitar & Vocals\n\nMik Bondy fills the “Jerry” role with modesty and an understanding that no one can replace Jerry – but that we all together can rejoice in his music. Mik has three tribute guitars (gifted to him personally by Andy Logan, owner of Jerry’s Alligator guitar and Founder of the Grateful Guitars Foundation) and hand built and modded recreations of Jerry’s actual guitar amps, effects and speakers. Mik loves to create music and art, and he can really feel the music when he’s performing. A long time Jerry-head, Mik enjoyed the last few years of Jerry’s life (87-95) following the Jerry Garcia Band around whenever he could. Mik has guested on guitar and vocals with Melvin Seals and JGB and has performed in front of Phil Lesh and with Tom “TC” Constanton, Maria Mulduar and Buzz Buchanan.\n\nMik uses DR Strings exclusively and is a FEATURED ARTIST for DR STRINGS!\n\nKat Walkerson – Vocals\n\nKat Walkerson adds heartfelt and soulful female vocals to the mix. She brings an awesome energy to the project and you can feel her love for this music though her singing. She exudes positive vibes and her smiles are a testament to her appreciation of the music. Kat has performed as vocalist for Melvin Seals and JGB and has been a guest vocalist with Dark Star Orchestra.\n\nDan F Crea – Bass\n\nDan brings a background in academic music theory, jazz, rock, and playing old and new country in smokey road houses across the upper Midwest as well as a thorough study of both John Kahn and Phil Lesh. He uses two customized Fender Precisions like Kahn used from ’74 to ’81, with Fender necks, Warmoth bodies, LaBella flatwound strings, and EMG electronics with a modified Steinberger Sprit with full EMG system and Steinberger flatwounds for the late 80’s early 90’s shows. With the Acoustically Speaking Trio he uses a Palatino electric upright bass.\n\nGuests of The Garcia Project have included:\n\nMaria Muldaur, Jerry Garcia Band\n\nBuzz Buchanan, Jerry Garcia Band\n\nMelvin Seals, Jerry Garcia Band\n\nJacklyn LaBranch, Jerry Garcia Band\n\nPeter Rowan, Old And In The Way\n\nTom Constanten, The Grateful Dead\n\nJacob Jolliff, Yonder Mountain String Band\n\nAndy Falco, Infamous String Dusters\n\nLisa Mackey, Dark Star Orchestra\n\nTom Circosta, The Zen Tricksters\n\nKlyph Black, The Zen Tricksters\n\nRyan Montbleau, The Ryan Montbleau Band\n\nGET EXCLUSIVE CONCERT LIVE STREAMS, VIDEOS, PHOTOS, EARLY BIRD TIX AND MORE BY SUPPORTING THE GARCIA PROJECT ON PATREON – Click this link and sign up to help our mission and get great perks:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thegarciaproject\n\nSong List (songs performed by The Jerry Garcia Band and The Garcia Project):\n\nName Artist Accidentally Like a Martyr Warren Zavon Ain’t No Bread In The Breadbox Norton Buffalo After Midnight J.J.

lists from 1976-1995. More than just a Jerry Garcia Band Tribute Band or Jerry Garcia Cover Band, using thoughtful arrangements and the proper instrumentation and feel, The Garcia Project faithfully channels and projects the feelings, emotions and music that propelled the Jerry Garcia Band and their fans through the years.\n\nFor anyone that never had a chance to experience the Jerry Garcia Band or for fans that want to relive a classic show, The Garcia Project delivers.\n\nThe Garcia Project has received rave reviews from the press and from fans. Touring across the country, The Garcia Project has made many fans extremely happy.\n\nThe Garcia Project is THE Jerry Garcia Band Tribute Band or Jerry Garcia Band Cover Band – and it’s about family, soul searching, rejoicing, contemplating, celebrating, seeking truth and loving one another.\n\nI spent a lot of nights in a lot of places with the Jerry Garcia Band, and I’m here to say that I really enjoy what The Garcia Project does with those memories. Mik’s guitar and his and Kat’s vocals stir up some very sweet vibes…some times they almost make me feel like I’m back in, say, 1992 at the Warfield. Check ‘em out. — Dennis McNally, former publicist for the Jerry Garcia Band\n\n“For those of us who crave late 70’s (and through the 80’s and 90’s) Jerry Garcia Band, The Garcia Project scratches that itch for hearing live renditions of JGB shows from that period.”\n\n— Bob Minkin, legendary Grateful Dead and Jerry Band rock photographer\n\n“The Garcia Project was on point with the whole experience and it didn’t seem like a cover band more like a mirrored band…they are just as real as the Jerry Garcia Band. “ – Buffalo FM Review\n\n“For those of us who crave late 70’s (and through the 80’s and 90’s) Jerry Garcia Band, The Garcia Project scratches that itch for hearing live renditions of JGB shows from that period.”\n\n— Bob Minkin, legendary Grateful Dead and Jerry Band rock photographer\n\n“The Garcia Project’s attention to detail on intonation and performance structure does set them apart as an authority on Jerry Garcia.” – NYSMUSIC\n\n“If you close your eyes, you’ll swear you are at a Jerry Garcia Band show.” – ecoLocal Magazine\n\n“The Garcia Project’s attention to detail on intonation and performance structure does set them apart as an authority on Jerry Garcia.” – NYSMUSIC\n\n“it was hard to tell that it wasn’t Jerry signing on “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.”” – NYSMUSIC\n\n“In order for a tribute band to be successful, fans need to look at them as the authority on the artist they are emulating. The Garcia Project pulls it off effortlessly. Go see them live …The Garcia Project is the whole package.” – Upstate Live"
