        "text": "When is enough enough? As we all have experienced on social media, people free of any filter can state outrageous, false, misleading, hurtful, and downright mean things with no fear of repercussions hidden behind a fake log in name. Well, Joe Bonamassa has had enough on Instagram. Around Thanksgiving of 2022 (late November) while getting ready to go onstage, Joe passed the time by perusing Instagram where he often interacted with the users. (Which is pretty cool!) What he saw were a series of insulting comments including one about how he looks and his receding hairline!\n\nHis reported response (by Ultimate Guitar) the next morning was:\n\n‚ÄúSo, after sleeping on this I have come to a conclusion. Last night I allowed a few clowns @rich_tones being one of them to cause me to go onstage angry. That is not fair to you the fans.\n\nAlso, This isn‚Äôt what I signed up for 8 years ago. Social media has become such a distraction for me. This place feels like it has the maturity of high school and I fear I am gonna be provoked one day into saying something i might regret.\n\nSo I‚Äôm leaving this wonderful place to the influencers and good looking. Enjoy it before it destroys your soul. I will see you in real life somewhere down the road and in Riverside tonight.\n\nAny posts on this page going forward will not be from me. Thanks for the 8 years. üòéüëç‚Äù\n\nAs I stated when it happened to Adele on social media over her weight, I don‚Äôt care whether an artist is tall or short, big or small, what their sexual orientation is, their race, or where they are from. I judge a roadhouse blues artist on how their music impacts me personally. Do they bring passion to their vocal and stage performances, is the musicianship engaging, do the lyrics resonate with me now or from some point in my life to date? In short do they move me to sing, dance, sway to the beat in my chair, party, drink, smoke, or recall some event or time in my life? That is what great music does! It can change your life, your way of thinking, and, in very special cases, impact a generation of listeners.\n\nIt is unclear to me whether Joe‚Äôs announcement applies to only his interactions on Instagram or social media in general. I hope it is only Instagram. During the Covid lockdown, Joe did a series of social media interview shows that were very entertaining. Joe is a guitar nerd at heart and it was fun to watch him discuss guitars and amps, as well as music, with a stellar list of blues and rock stars. He doesn‚Äôt come across as a blues super star but as just a guy who loves music and enjoys what he does best.\n\nJoe Bonamassa is without a doubt a superstar of contemporary blues rock. And he has largely done it his way. He doesn‚Äôt use promoters; he books his own concert venues, takes the risks, and reaps the rewards. He has his own record label and now has established another non profit label, Keep the Blues Alive, to help give opportunity and visibility to other lesser known stars of the blues.\n\nJoe has also always had a large number of detractors. They say ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt have soul in his music‚Äù, ‚Äúhe really doesn‚Äôt play the blues‚Äù, ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt looks like a bluesman‚Äù and ‚Äúhe drives up the prices of collectible guitars because he buys so many‚Äù‚Ä¶..to highlight just a few. And, over the years, Joe Bonamassa has largely been ignored by the Grammy Awards (a couple of nominations) and the Blues Music Foundation (a couple of awards).\n\nIn spite of it all, Joe continues to turn out some stellar blues and blues rock music. He is giving back to the blues community through his support of the Blues In the Schools initiative and now the KTBA record label. But when it comes to social media, enough is enough. Can‚Äôt say that I blame him. When it impacts your on stage performance, it‚Äôs time to move on!\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments section. Is Joe being thin skinned? What would you do as an artist in a similar situation?\n\n#bluesmusic #blues #benveeroadhouseblues #bluesnews\n\nZZ Top ‚Äì RAW (That Little Ol‚Äô Band From Texas Original Soundtrack) (2022 Shelter Records/BMG)\n\nRecorded in 2019 as part of the documentary ‚ÄúThat Little Ol‚Äô Band from Texas‚Äú, this legendary trio retreated to their garage rock roots by renting the oldest dance hall in Texas, the Gruene Hall, and then crankin‚Äô out versions of a dozen of their classic tunes. There were no crowds; just the band and recording staff. Dusty Hill was magical on the bass, Frank Beard kept a tight pocket with an insistent beat, and Billy Gibbons provided his signature guitar licks and raw vocals. With the death of Dusty, the magic that was ZZ Top will never pass this way again. And as the last recording of the group, it stands as a mighty testament to their fusion of rock and blues. It is well worth every nickel you pay for the download or the vinyl.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival ‚Äì At the Royal Albert Hall April 14, 1970 (2022 Craft Records)\n\nRecorded by the BBC during Creedence Clearwater Revival‚Äôs first tour of Europe in 1970, this music was never released because of the never ending battles between the band and their original label, Fantasy Records. Now, after 52 years, you get to hear CCR at their finest with John Fogerty on vocals and guitars, his older brother Tim Fogerty on rhythm guitars, Stu Cook on bass and Doug ‚ÄòCosmo‚Äô Clifford on drums.\n\nCCR sprang to fame in 1968 with a cover of Dale Hawkin‚Äôs Suzy Q, burned brightly as a true super group for 4 years and then they were gone; the victim of internal band strife and business battles. But on this spring night in 1970, they were in top musical form for the 13 songs on the recording kicking out what I have always referred to as swamp blues rock. For me, this was a nostalgic trip back to the golden era of music. For those of you who may have never have heard CCR live, this recording is well worth a listen and representative of the talent of Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\nJoan Osborne ‚Äì Radio Waves (2022 Womanly Hips Records)\n\nJoan Osborne is one of those artists that I have always included in the pantheon of Roadhouse Blues artists because her music and songwriting are an outpouring of her soul; to me the essence of the blues. She got her start singing at blues mic open nights at clubs in New York City in the 1980‚Äôs. She had a mega hit with One of Us in the 1990‚Äôs but I have never felt the song was representative of her body of work which is much more blues, soul and R&B influenced. In fact, she was nominated for a Grammy for the best blues album of 2013, Bring It On Home.\n\nHer newest recording, Radio Waves, is an interesting compilation of 13 songs that she recorded at radio stations between 1995 and 2012. Normally these type recordings are done as part of a promotional tour and have more of a live feel to them which is a strong suit for Joan. Give Shake Your Hips, Only You and I Know, and My Love Is Alive a listen They should help remind you of the talent of this gifted songwriter and singer.\n\nHundred Seventy Split ‚Äì The Story So Far (2022 Repertoire Records )\n\nFormed in 2010, this blues rock trio features the legendary Leo Lyons of Ten Years After on bass, Joe Gooch on vocals and guitars, and Damon Sawyer on drums. They are a fabulous band and this recording features songs from five of their recordings over the past decade. Joe on guitar is a fantastic replacement for the late great Alvin Lee. Take a listen to Going Home to see what I mean. Devil To Pay is some straight up badass blues rock and I Grew Up on Muddy Waters is a live tribute to the man who is the father of the electric Roadhouse Blues. This compilation recordings should serve as a great introduction to the many of you that are not yet familiar with this great British roadhouse blues group!!\n\nI listened to a lot of new music this past year; 750 albums and over 10,000 individual recordings! Amongst all that music there were four notable Posthumous recordings that I believe are worth your attention and your ear!!\n\nDr. John ‚Äì Things Happen That Way (Rounder Records 2022)\n\nHe was born Malcolm John Rebennack and he was a mainstay of the New Orleans music scene as I grew up. His first album Gris Gris released in 1968 featured Caribbean and New Orleans influences that melded easily with the psychedelic spirit of the time. The persona of Dr. John the Night Tripper emerged in those days borne on the wings of emerging album oriented rock FM stations and stage show performances featuring outlandish fashions and eccentric creativity replete with allusions to the voodoo mystique of his hometown.\n\nOver his career, Dr. John released 30 studio albums and contributed to dozens of others by artists that most of us know. At the time of his sudden death in June of 2019, he was working on a recording that became the material for the 2022 release, Things Happen That Way. It is a distinctive recording featuring contributions by Willie Nelson, Willie‚Äôs son Lukas, Dr. John‚Äôs life long hometown friend Aaron Neville, and some great vocals by Nashville artist Katie Pruitt on End of the Line and Holy Water. Dr. John‚Äôs rendition of the Traveling Wilburys End of the Line is absolutely spot on! And I enjoyed Funny How Time Slips Away, Ramblin‚Äô Man, Sleeping Dog Best Left Alone, and the prophetic Guess Things Happen That Way.\n\nOn Dr. John‚Äôs first album Gris Gris in 1968, he recorded a tune, I Walk On Guilded Splinters that has always been one of my favorites. And it is fitting for his last recording that he comes full circle on his career with a rerecording of this fabulous song (and my favorite on an album) that is a touching close to the storied life and career of Dr. John.\n\nThe Doors ‚Äì Paris Blues (Rhino Records 2022)\n\nOver 51 years after his death, the final known studio recording of Jim Morrison and The Doors has been released. Paris Blues is a song that was recorded sometime before the L.A. Woman album in 1971. Morrison died in July of that year and in the ensuing years, neither Robby Krieger or Ray Manzarek felt inclined to release it on a series of posthumous recording which were uneven snippets of live recording and outtakes featuring an often drunk and unintelligible Morrison.\n\nDoors diehard fans have been aware of the song recording for a long time but it was thought lost forever when Manzarek took the studio tape home and his young toddler accidentally taped over a very small portion of it. Through the use of modern digital recording techniques, the song was been resuscitated and is the title cut of a new recording released by Rhino Records. The album includes two other previously unreleased songs, I Will Never Be True (an original) and a cover of Robert Johnson‚Äôs Me And the Devil Blues. There are a couple of other songs recorded live at a political event for Norman Mailer back in 1968 and three songs featuring Albert King that were released originally on Live In Vancouver 1970.\n\nTo be blunt, Paris Blues is a keeper as a single but the rest of album is only of interest to die hard Doors fans and record collectors fleshing out their Doors discography. My theme for my shows on the internet and my blog is based on the Door‚Äôs tune, Roadhouse Blues. I love the mental imagery associated with this song of friends getting together at a roadhouse and havin‚Äô a good time drinking and smoking while listening to blues based rock tunes. And I have tried to flesh out that imagery with contemporary blues, blues rock, and ‚Äúhead music‚Äù during my roadhouse blues shows over the years. For me, this ‚Äúnew‚Äù recording is a sad reminder of both Jim‚Äôs love of the blues and the way he squandered his talent in a haze of smoke, booze, and hard drugs. I am still mad at him about it. But every show that I do and every line that I write about blues music is a testament to the influence of Jim Morrison and The Doors music on my life.\n\nJanis Joplin & Jorma Kaukonen ‚Äì The Legendary Typewriter Tape: 6/25/64 Jorma‚Äôs House (Omnivore Records 2022)\n\nBack in the day, the Queen of the Psychedelic Blues was Janis Joplin. Like Johnny and Edgar Winter, Janis had been raised in the Golden Triangle of East Texas. She burst onto the national music scene in 1967 in San Francisco as part of the Big Brother & the Holding Company band at the Monterey Pop Festival. And two years later, she was enshrined in the annals of music history with her performance at Woodstock.\n\nJanis first went to San Francisco in 1963 and during a two year stint there Janet‚Äôs drug use got her arrested for shoplifting and she developed a reputation as a ‚Äúspeed freak‚Äù. But no one could deny her talent amongst the local San Francisco artists including Jorma Kaukonen, later to become an original member of Jefferson Airplane. Jorma had met her soon after arriving in California at a local club where other aspiring artists including the Grateful Dead were playing. They hit it off and Janis asked him to play with her for some gigs she had going. During 1964, Jorma invited Janis to rehearse with him at his home. As Jorma‚Äôs wife Margareta typed a letter to her parents in Russia in the background, Jorma and Janis used a Sony mono tape recorder to rehearse and then listen to the playback. That one day rehearsal in June of 1964 would become known at the Legendary Typewriter Tape. It has been available for years as a raw bootleg. Now it has been mixed professionally (and legally) and released by Omnivore Recordings.\n\nFor Joplin fans, this recording is pure magic. Janis is sittin‚Äô in a living room singing the blues that she most certainly lived in her own life. For me, the recording brings to mind another great blues woman, Memphis Minnie, who eventually settled in my hometown of New Orleans. Both had charming southern drawls and a vocal delivery that takes the blues right down into your soul.\n\nEven as a rehearsal tape, I love Janis‚Äô renditions of Trouble In Mind, Hesitation Blues, Long Black Train, Nobody Knows You When You Are Down and Out, and Daddy Daddy Daddy. All are blues standards and she does justice to all of them. The enhanced quality of the new release should make it more accessible to blues lovers, not just collectors. Janis ended her life tragically with a heroin overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. This recording reinforces just what a rare and genuine blues talent Janis was. It is just so sad to think of all the great music she could have made if she had lived into her eighties like Koko Taylor and Etta James.\n\nSven Zetterberg ‚Äì Rain On (The Lost Session) (Parma Records 2022)\n\nOne of the all time great Swedish bluesmen Sven Zetterberg passed away in December of 2016 at the age of 64. He was never well known to the general public in North America but what a talent he was. His voice was equally at home singing classic blues, soul and Rhythm & Blues and his artistry on the guitar and harmonica were matched by his songwriting skills. As sometimes happens, he did a studio session in 1999, as he was beginning a solo career, that was put in the can and saved for another day. It is an incredible recording that has been released by Parma Records entitled Rain On (The Lost Session).\n\nAs a testament to how highly Sven was regarded by American blues artists, Kim Wilson (The Fabulous Thunderbirds) appears on two of the songs on harmonica; I Ain‚Äôt from Mississippi and Start from Scratch. For me personally, I best loved Sven when he was belting out R&B and soul songs and there are a couple on the recording that are jewels; the title cut Rain On and That‚Äôs All I Need. And as examples of his straight up blues talent there are You Oughta Be Ashamed and Blues in My Heart.\n\nI can not figure out for the life of me why this recording was not issued back in 1999 or 2000. My only guesses are that because he released his first solo album in 1999 (Blues From Within), the tracks on this recording were put on hold or there was a disagreement between music business entities (which happens more often than it should) that put this recording session to the side. Whatever the case, I am glad the Parma Records has released the recording now. It is a lasting testament to a bluesman who helped bring the good news of the blues to a whole generation of European blues audiences. Now, posthumously, North American audiences will get another chance to appreciate his talent.\n\n#blues #bluesmusic #bluesrock #bestof2022\n\nBen Vee started out spinning songs on terrestrial radio and at nightclubs back in the 1970‚Äôs in his home state of Louisiana. After a career in the construction business, he returned to DJing in 2011. He now hosts two shows each week on http://www.bluesmusicfan.com and writes about the blues at http://www.benveeblues.com from his home in Connecticut. He also has a personal 24 hour stream devoted to the Roadhouse Blues‚Ä¶ WRHB as well as a Youtube channel.\n\nI have started compiling my Roadhouse Blues ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù lists and over the next couple of months, they will begin to appear here on my blues blog, on my Youtube Video channel, and on my Spotify playlists. During 2022, I reviewed or sampled over 750 new blues and blues rock albums and over 10,000 songs submitted to me directly or that I received via my association with BluesMusicFan Radio. For 2022, there are three albums that pay tribute to Roadhouse blues rock artists and their music that I think are well worth your time!\n\nBeth Hart ‚Äì A Tribute to Led Zeppelin (Provogue Records/Mascot Label Group 2022)\n\nBeth Hart has one of the best and most distinctive voices of her generation. She has been a perennial member of my internet radio show playlists over the last decade. She is a California native who got her big break when she won the annual Ed McMahon Star Search competition back in the early 1990‚Äôs. One of the highlights of her early concerts were renditions she did of Led Zeppelin tunes. There are videos on the net that show her singing her heart out and even dropping to the floor belting out Zepp tunes Robert Plant style. But as the nineties progressed, Beth got steadily more and more out of control as she dealt with drug issues and she eventually had to take a break to get her life back together. The albums Leave The Light On and My California helped revive her career in the mid 2000‚Äôs and she became a favorite amongst blues and blues rock audiences through her association with Joe Bonamassa on the 2011 Don‚Äôt Explain, the 2013 See Saw, and the 2018 Black Coffee releases.\n\nIn 2022, Beth Hart returned to her blues rock roots with the 12 song release of ‚ÄúA Tribute to Led Zeppelin‚Äú. Always known as a high energy concert performer, the power and quality of her voice are a perfect match for the tunes. She covers songs from a number of the eight Led Zeppelin studio recordings including the classics Stairway to Heaven and Kashmir. My personal favorite is her cover of The Rain Song; it is Beth in her full majesty!\n\nThe Rock House All Stars ‚Äì Let It Bleed Revisited ‚Äì An Ovation from Nashville (Qualified Records 2022)\n\nReleased in 1969, Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones is still considered one of the best rock recording of all time. For a group of Nashville studio musicians, together with a talented array of local vocal artists, to take on the challenge of recreating the songs on the album speaks volumes to the lasting legacy of the initial album. Guided by producers Kevin McKendree and John Heithaus, The Rock House All Stars band does justice to the songs while allowing the vocalists some creativity in the their interpretation of the music on the ten songs.\n\nJimmy Hall (Wet Willie) roars out of the gate on the album with his cover of Gimme Shelter and is assisted on vocals by Bekka Bramlett, the daughter of Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett. Jimmy has been one of my favorite blues and blues rock singers (and harmonica players) over the years and he does a great job on the tune. The title cut, Let It Bleed, is sung by Emil Justian & Greg Mayo. They give it a bit more of a Nashville feel than the original but it is a great cover. Wendy Moten, a finalist on The Voice in 2021, belts out You Can‚Äôt Always Get What You Want and Rick Huckaby does a great job on Midnight Rambler. And I really liked the Mike Farris rendition of Monkey Man.\n\nOver the years, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, have toyed at the fringes of country music on a handful of their recordings. The Rock House All Stars have run with that thought and produced an entertaining and respectful rendering of the original album.\n\nVarious Artists ‚Äì Legacy ‚Äì A Tribute to Leslie West (Provogue Records/Mascot Label Group 2022)\n\nI first listened to Leslie West as a member of Mountain back in the day and I was a fan for all of his life. As the years went by, Leslie became a blues rock fan favorite and produced a series of stellar albums that have regularly been featured on my shows. On Legacy ‚Äì A Tribute to Leslie West, a heavy weight group of guitar players including Zakk Wylde, Martin Barre (Jethro Tull), Robby Krieger (the Doors), Slash, and Yngwie Malmsteen all pay respect to the songwriting and music of Leslie.\n\nAs would be expected, my favorite on the album is Mississippi Queen featuring Marc Labelle, vocalist for Dirty Honey and Slash on guitar. Joe Lynn Turner (Deep Purple, Rainbow) and guitar master Marty Friedman do an incredible job on Nantucket Sleighride and I loved Charlie Starr (Blackberry Smoke) on Silver Paper as well as the Bachman Brothers (Randy & Tal) on Money.\n\nListening to all of these Leslie West tribute songs brought back a lot of great memories. If you were a Leslie fan, I am sure it will do so for you also.\n\n#blues #bluesrock #bluesmusic\n\nBen Vee started out spinning songs on terrestrial radio and at nightclubs back in the 1970‚Äôs in his home state of Louisiana.
