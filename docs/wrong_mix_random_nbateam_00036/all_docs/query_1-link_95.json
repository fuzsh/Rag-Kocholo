        "text": "Delaney and Bonnie & Friends, \"On Tour With Eric Clapton (Deluxe Edition)\" (Rhino). 4 ½ stars.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers, “Damn the Torpedoes – Classic Albums” (Eagle Vision – Blu-ray - DVD). 4 stars.\n\nRarities and Reissues\n\nDelaney and Bonnie & Friends, \"On Tour With Eric Clapton (Deluxe Edition)\" (Rhino). 4 ½ stars.\n\nHere’s one that’s way too neglected in rock history but the folks at Rhino had the good sense to expand it far beyond the original single album into a four-CD set.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, musicians Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett had their roots in Mississippi and Illinois respectively, met and married in Los Angeles, where they hooked up with some of the finest musicians the U.S. had to offer. That led them to befriend some of England’s most famed players as well. Eventually all came together on a wild and raucous seven-night, 13-show tour of the U.K in December, 1969, which had an extraordinary influence on rock history.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell their backing musicians just happened to include Eric Clapton and most of the band that soon become Derek and the Dominoes, along with George Harrison, Dave Mason, horn players Jim Price and Bobby Keys, singer Rita Coolidge and even more. Indeed, this weeklong tour of England played a pivotal role in influencing some of rock's most famous albums including Derek and the Dominoes' \"Layla,\" and Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass.\"\n\nThe original \"On Tour\" album sounded muddy and lasted 40 minutes. This expanded version sounds great and lasts more than three hours.\n\nPackaged in a makeshift road case, the box includes the group's complete performance at London's Royal Albert Hall, as well as a composite of shows at Colston Hall in Bristol and the tour finale at Fairfield Halls in Croydon.\n\nIt’s immense and it’s extraordinary, with masterful versions of Bonnie taking the roof off the top of “That’s What My Man is For,” and sizzling takes of other cuts including Mason’s “Only You Know and I Know,” “Poor Elijah/Tribute to Johnson” and the sizzling instrumental jam “Pigmy.”\n\nThe set includes a bunch of totally unreleased material and totally unreleased tracks like Clapton’s rockin’ run through “I Don’t Know Why,” and Bobby Whitlock basically laying the foundation for Derek and the Dominoes on the cover of the Spencer Davis Group’s hit “Gimme Some Lovin’.” A rockin’ “Little Richard Medley” also holds up well to this day with tracks including “Tutti Frutti,” “The Girl Can’t Help It,” “Long Tall Sally,” and Jenny Jenny.”\n\nHere's an ultra-rare film clip of Delaney and Bonnie performing with Eric Clapton and Dave Mason:\n\nDVD Spotlight\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers, \"Damn the Torpedoes – Classic Albums\" (Eagle Vision – Blu-ray). 4 stars.\n\nHaving a bunch of music writers go back and forth offering dry analytical retro-gazing at an album made in 1979 can be flat-out boring.\n\nHaving the guys who actually made the album though can be fascinating, especially when it's characters as articulate and as seasoned as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nPetty and Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench are the stars of this affair, which revisits the band's breakthrough album \"Damn the Torpedoes.\" The DVD finds them back in the studio, telling colorful tales about a recording which spawned the hits \"Refugee,\" \"Here Comes My Girl,\" \"Don't Do Me Like That\" and \"Even the Losers.\"\n\nThere’s a particularly fascinating breakdown of “Refugee,” which takes the song from its inception to its completion. The DVD is interspersed with various music videos as well as commentary from co-producer Jimmy Iovine and engineer Shelly Yakus.\n\nThe disc includes 42 minutes of bonus material, highlighted by Campbell’s reflections on the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar that helped give the band its distinctive sound."
