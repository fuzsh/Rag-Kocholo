        "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nContact: Shane Reichardt\n\nPublic Relations Coordinator\n\n(909) 735-2440\n\ninfo@fendermuseum.com\n\nYoung Hearts Flock to Corona for Benefit Concert by Steve Miller\n\nat Fender Museum of Music and the Arts®\n\nCORONA, CA (Sept. 13, 2003) - Fender Museum of Music and the Arts® hosted nearly 2000 guests for a concert to benefit the Museum's Kids Rock Free program. The diverse crowd was made up of young and old and included television and movie actor, David Spade, Corona Mayor, Jeffery Bennett, Congressman Ken Calvert, and executives from Capitol Records. Well-known Arrow 93 FM DJ Joe Benson, who recently interviewed Steve Miller for the station, MC'd the event.\n\nWith Sheryl Crow-like sounds, Corona musician Kirsten Proffit warmed up the audience with her original tunes, as well as, a musical tribute to the late Johnny Cash. It wasn't long before Proffit had the crowd dancing in the isles.\n\nSteve Miller graciously agreed to perform for free to support the Museum's many great programs. Miller's schedule was jam-packed leading up to his September 16th greatest hits release titled Young Hearts. The previous night Miller had played on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, days later he was scheduled to be a guest on the Jimmy Kimmel show. Miller played many of his well-known hits and a few not often heard tunes. Showcasing the Museum's Kids Rock Free® program was 16-year-old Alex Zimmer from Corona and 17-year-old David Fujinami from Ontario who joined Mr. Miller onstage, guitars in hand, to show off the skills they honed in the program. Fujinami and Zimmer played guitar like pros and appeared unfazed by the crowd or by sharing stage with some of the greatest musicians.\n\nFender Museum president, Jeff Marshburn commented, \"Steve Miller was our first concert of this size. With incredible dedication and hard work by our small staff and a great group of volunteers who put in hundreds of hours helping out, we were able to raise money to continue our programs into the future. Of course we can't thank Mr. Miller, his band, Kirsten Proffit and her band, Joe Benson, the Corona police and fire departments and all of the Museum's supporters enough for all of their time and effort tonight. This was a great event for the Fender Museum and the community, and hopefully one of many to come.\"\n\nFor additional information go to www.fendermuseum.com, call (909) 735-2440 or stop by.
