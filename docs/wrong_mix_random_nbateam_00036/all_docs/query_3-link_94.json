        "text": "We went into a beautiful studio near Nederland called \"Caribou Ranch\"..It belonges to a famous dude named Jim Guercio...He had something to do with the band Chicago......It is a knocked out studio sitting right up in the mountains!.. Very secluded and private and everybody who was somebody or even thought they were wanted to record there...Steven was no exception..And, he was somebody for sure...CSN&Y...Very cool!...\"I'm hanging in and hanging out and hanging on for dear life.\"...The snow was as deep inside the studio as it was outside of it...We started to record and things were going fairly well considering Steven's ego was a \"nose to nose\" \"finish-line\" with Delaney's..What a GREAT bunch of metaphors in a row!..After packing his nose holes full, Steven wanted to and thought he could play EVERYTHING!...Including the B3....Huh-oh...I could see it all coming...It was very clear to me that I was being used, but to what extent I did not know...YET....He would come in after I got finished and would TRY to take over..His playing was God-Awful!...A Hammond B3's my thing!...His feet weren't nearly big enough!......Despite all of the drugs and alcohol and the massive ego everything was real cool between us...I had worked with Delaney Bramlett who's ego was right there with James Brown's, so I knew how to handle the situation...Just stand back and be quiet, be patient and wait...Like a storm cloud blows itself away, so do the self-endulged egomaniacs...But Steven had a long way to go to get up there and run with the real horses......BW c2008\n\nThis may be out of sequence on this thread but you can put it together...\n\nWhen we were recording at Caribou we had Dallas Taylor on drums, Joe LaLa on congas, and Fuzzy Samuels on bass, Cris Hillman and Steven on guitars, Paul Harris on piano and Me on the organ, when I could keep Steven off of it!.........For some reason right in the middle of recording he decided that he wanted to go down to Miami to Criteria and finish it up...I don't know if it was because of all the indoor snow or just why he had to go so urgently...I imagine it was the snow...I met Jim Guercio and he is a straight up guy and a together business man...A rare somebody then AND now!...He probably didn't like what was going on so openly there either... I guess it just got too cold for Steven, and I was happy about it.......I don't know, but we went to Miami in short order.........He had a guy named who worked for him named Michael John Bowen that was his gopher. \"Michael go for this or go for that or go for some cheese-burgers and be quick about it!\"..Or something like that...He just did whatever he was told to do and when to do it by Steven......I'll never forget his name because he never paid me for playing and singing and helping to produce and mix the record...It was his responsibility to do so as well...He was like, the road manager of sorts...He did a little of everything...It's hard to tell when the crew act like it's their show...Everybody's the boss when He's not looking...He said that I got to stay at Steven's house and play on his record and that was payment enough for me and proceeded to run me out of town!!! They were pissed off at me because a photographer friend of theirs girlfriend had flown there to see me without my knowledge......I had moved out of Steven's house and was staying in this beautiful HUGE log house that had the original small log cabin in the middle of it...They had built the big house right around the little one...Exactly like something That I would do...It was nessled in the cleavage of two very tall hills with another hill behind it...Quite beautiful to see that picture still in my mind.........Everything was about to change...Here she comes as pretty as you please and I was momentarily stunned by the site of her getting out of the car and it driving away without her.....This is out in the middle of nowhere!...I did not see this one coming! Another wrinkle in the fabric of my life...One more obsticle to overcome, only this obsticle would turn out to be the mother of my children and my nemesis for twenty-three volatile years......BW c2008\n\nWe arrived in Miami and went straight into the studio...Ronnie and Howie Albert were the engineers...They worked on the Layla album...Mighty fine engineers...By this time they were working with the BeeGee's and Alhbey Galuten producing...\"Never judge by appearances\"...He was the studio gopher at criteria when we did LOALS... NEVER wore shoes!..Alhbey came pulling up to the studio one day in a Detomaso Pantera and got out and STILL had no shoes on...I asked him does he ever wear them and he said, no!...Producing the BeeGee's and doesn't wear shoes yet!...Go figure........Here we go with Steven...He went straight to the blow instead of to work...We had brought the tapes from Caribou with us so there wasn't a room full of players..This was mostly an over-dub and mixing session...We wound up doing more than that though....Dallas had come as well and he was rocking and reelin' at that time pretty good all by himself...Weren't we all...Steven had a huge bag of Peruvian blow full of rocks...His nose was so wrecked that he could'nt get anything up it......I told him to tilt his head back and I'd pour it in for him...He did, and I did...It was all over his face..He looked like Al Pacino in Scarface when he raised his head up off of the desk after cramming his face into a pile of what Steven had a boulder of lodged in one of his nostrils....I don't know if I should write this or not but it is true!..A rock about the size of a nickel was stuck in one of his nose holes..He panicked!..I said, \"Be cool, I'll help you\"....I grabbed him by the nose and squeezed as hard as I could!......He freaked and left that night to go back home...He said to Ronnie and Howie and Me \"You guys finish it!\"...We did... With him out of the way we put on some killer background vocals and Hammod that rocked...And then mixed the whole thing....I brought it back to Colorado expecting him to love it but he took it back in the studio and took most of what we had done off and remixed it and it would up sounding like ****!..And I NEVER got paid!.......I guess I just did.......BW c2008"
