If you are deeply offended by criticism, non-worshipping approach to your favourite artist, or opinions that do not match your own, do not read any further.

For specific non-comment-related questions, consult the message board.\n\nFor reading convenience, please open the reader comments section in a parallel browser window.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEric Clapton is the greatest guitar player on earth. Period. You can deny everything about him - say that his songwriting skills are deep down in the toilet, that over the past twenty years he has brilliantly succeeded in eliminating all of his Cream legacy, that a lot of his output, especially in the Eighties, is stupid pop crap, that he's no showman, that he only pretends to be 'rocking' when in fact for a long time he's been doing little else but soft sludge, and lots of nasty things.\n\nI AGREE. Well, not completely. All of these arguments are quite valid. Eric is indeed a very limited songwriter - but he just follows the classical 'rule' that says 'either you play guitar or you write songs, you can't be God in both categories'. Like every limited songwriter, he's got a handful of self-penned classics behind his belt, but he was never prolific. In his early Cream days, he's written about two or three songs, and even later, when his songwriting finally got on a roll, he was as a rule covering others' songs better than producing his own ones. But, well, this is not the best argument on Earth. Likewise, both Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page were pretty limited songwriters, certainly not better than Eric could ever hope to be, and somehow legions of both their demented and their more cool-headed fans never seem to bring it up as an argument to disqualify them.\n\nAs for the other statements, I agree only partially. It is true that the greatest legacy that Eric has left to us (and I really doubt he'll be leaving much more than he already did) lies in what he did in the Sixties, mainly with Cream, and in the early Seventies, with the Dominos. And there is a large distance between albums like Layla and, I dunno, Backless, not to mention the Phil Collins-produced garbage of the mid-Eighties. But dismissing all of Eric's output after 1970 based on the assumption that 'it's all soft rock crap' is plain ridiculous. Whoever gave the right to proclaim 'hard' rock's undisputable supremacy over 'soft' rock? The matter is not whether you play low distorted notes or high clear ones; the matter is whether you play your instrument good or play it bad.\n\nThe main problem I see with Eric's post-1973 career is that he's been a bit too intelligent for his own sake. Starting with 461 Ocean Boulevard, he has imposed a self-created curse upon himself. Yes, I know he probably thought it a blessing, but alas, time has shown that it was an incorrect decision. Namely, he has done everything possible to wash away the tag of 'guitar hero'. Most of his studio albums feature a very limited amount of guitar solos, and even when he played live, he always behaved as if he was just an ordinary player in an ordinary band, not noticing the fact that people came to his concert to see him play the guitar. Instead, he turned to 'experimenting' with various roots rock genres, moving into soft blues, country, and gospel territory, and trying to build up a 'new' reputation from scratch. Did he succeed? On a certain level, perhaps; many of his regular studio albums sold well, and commercially Eric is still a good proposition. He's the favourite 'rocker' of every decent housewife and every respected politician - why, he's clean, he doesn't swear, he plays 'blues', and he has 'feeling'. Recently, Eric has joined the 'Great Washed Up Club': you can regularly see him at some charity concert with other ancient losers, such as Paul McCartney or Elton John. His latest albums are heavily influenced by contemporary production values (so he's 'hip'), and...\n\n...wait! Why are you running away? Come back and stop your vomiting! I know, I know. Eric has got many faults, and none of the things described above qualifies him as someone that real serious rock music lovers should be listening to. But you have to get over the image, you know. Get over the image and concentrate on the music: Eric has really come up with some brilliant compositions of his own, as well as some blistering covers of other persons' material, over the years, and his performances have usually been tasteful, gracious and pleasant, when not spoiled by Phil Collins. And also, over the years this infamous self-imposed curse has slowly been dissipating. The first half of the Nineties has been especially good for him: Unplugged and From The Cradle stand out as brilliant achievements that really made me thought he was back - until I heard his latest crap, of course. But here I am, and let ME guide you through the crap and lead you to the records that are indeed worth picking, if you're credulous enough to trust my opinion.\n\nAnd it's also not true that Eric doesn't play the guitar at all after 1973. First of all, he doesn't play anything else; he's bound to be playing guitar. Second, it's just that on all of his solo studio records, he never goes overboard with his instrument - most of the solos are short, snappy and up-to-the-point. It's practically impossible to find a Clapton record without guitar solos, just as it is impossible to find a Jethro Tull record without the flute. And Clapton's guitar playing always does him a good service: it arrives at the right moment to save even the most disgusting record (yeah, like the Phil Collins-produced ones) from the utter depths of humiliation.\n\nAnd his guitar playing is really good. It's also quite controversial: for instance, I have heard many people complain about his 'too technical' approach to the guitar, saying that his playing is self-indulgent, emotionless and serves exclusively to shock the so-called 'blues elite' with its flawlessness. Now if it's Cream or Blind Faith we're talking of, I can understand such complaints, although I don't necessarily agree. But if it's his solo stuff, starting from Derek and the Dominos, that we're talking of, then I, for one, hold exactly the opposite opinion.\n\nClapton isn't that much of a 'technician', really. He did explore the potential of the guitar in the mid-Sixties, but the end of Cream put an end to that. Since then, Eric's guitar playing was always directed exclusively into the side of 'emotion'. And this is, indeed, what makes it so special to me. See, Eric managed to get the reputation of 'best guitar player' (or, at least, one of the best) without any special tricks. He didn't use the guitar as an integral part of his body, like Jimi Hendrix; he never used it as a monstruous sonic tool, like Pete Townshend; he never grated it with a violin bow, like Jimmy Page; and he never played ten thousand notes per second, like Ritchie Blackmore. He played it, that's all. His solos might be long, but they're never gimmicky. Moreover, he is one of the extremely rare guitarists who can be a great master of complicated technics and blazing speed, but is often willing to hold off these things because he just as well understands the true meaning of pauses in between the notes. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out Clapton's guitar solos on 'Double Trouble' and 'Blues Power' from the Just One Night album; not a single guitarist I know could have combined both of these approaches with such complete mastery. And of course, Eric's technique never values much if the actual sounds he's playing aren't filled with emotion: for that, listen to Live At The Fillmore, the record which, in my opinion, is the best place to start with Eric as a guitar player, and tell me these solos aren't directed right at the bottom of your heart. They are, and that's a fact. Few guitarists have brought me to the edge of tears as frequently and consistently as Eric, and yup, I am a wuss who likes to cry over a really heartmoving song (and if you don't, get out of here, you stone-hearted metallic idiot). And for that, I'm ready to forgive him every single bit of crap he's pumped on me through the years - no matter how much (and aye, much it is).\n\nAnd let me go out with a bang, too: I've had enough of pretentious elitist idiots who dismiss Clapton with a wave of their hand, saying stuff like \"soulless routine white boy trying to play the blues\". Clapton certainly plays his blues in a different way than the old black masters; this is only natural, considering that he's a white Brit boy who basically lived outside the whole blues legacy. But different does not mean worse - and much too often, it means better, as Eric never relied on tired blues cliches, always looking for new sounds and new inspirations. His basic music style might have become deeply conservative since the mid-Seventies, but that did not really involve his constant search for a new style of soloing: the 1975 live Clapton, for instance, is vastly different both from the 1980 live Clapton and the 1992 live Clapton. Of course, if somebody isn't deep enough to appreciate the soulfulness and profound inspiration of Clapton's playing, both in its recorded and improvised form, I can only pity the person in question; however, I suspect it has far more to do with the natural feeling of despisal that \"elitists\" experience towards any artist that acquired commercial success. I mean, sometimes I feel that if Eric's records sold ten times less than they did and if he weren't elevated to god status by the mass-media, critics and the 'simpler' public (which is also unjust, but at least it's better to pray to the man than to trample him into the dirt), he would have been a true underground hero and all the \"elitists\" would now be worshipping him like they worship... ehhh... Negativland instead. But noooo, he went ahead and recorded an unplugged version of 'Layla', the bastard! The scum! The dirty white boy ripping off the old masters! To hell with him! We fuckin' hate ze guy!\n\nThat's what I call \"unprovoked self-brain-washing\". Was I too rude? Hardly.\n\nOn this page, I am reviewing most of Eric's solo albums (starting from 1973's Rainbow Concert), as well as his Derek And The Dominos output and the single album he cut with John Mayall in 1966. Cream and Blind Faith, the two famous supergroups he played in, were much more than just 'Eric and company', so both of them receive separate pages on this site. And, much as I'd like to review Eric's Yardbirds catalog, I'll have to wait until I get something substantial, other than just a hit package of the band I have, which only includes three or four songs they recorded with Clapton. Yup, Eric's career was a long and fruitful one.\n\nGeneral Evaluation:\n\nListenability: 3/5. While I'm far from dismissing Eric's solo career as 'TOO BORING (drumroll)', as so many people do, I do admit he had major lapses of taste in the Eighties and... ugh... yyyuck... nineties. Oh boy, don't get me started.\n\nResonance: 5/5. Like I said, the man wears his heart on practically everything he puts out - even if it's backed by a techno beat.\n\nOriginality: 1/5. Unfortunately, Eric left his originality with Cream.\n\nAdequacy: 3/5. Eehhh... See \"Listenability\" and \"Resonance\". If you wear your heart on your sleeve, you might as well be regularly attaching GOOD music to it.\n\nDiversity: 3/5. For such a surprisingly \"lagging\" solo career, Eric has explored a surprisingly wide range of styles.\n\nOverall: 3.0 = C on the rating scale.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nALBUM REVIEWS JOHN MAYALL'S BLUESBREAKERS WITH ERIC CLAPTON\n\nYear Of Release: 1966\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 12\n\n\"Seminal\" is the word, although today, neither Eric nor John McVie seem to be reaping too many of the sprouts.\n\nBest song: DOUBLE CROSSIN' TIME\n\nTrack listing: 1) All Your Love; 2) Hideaway; 3) Little Girl; 4) Another Man; 5) Double Crossin' Time; 6) What'd I Say; 7) Key To Love; 8) Parchman Farm; 9) Have You Heard; 10) Ramblin' On My Mind; 11) Steppin' Out; 12) It Ain't Right.\n\nThis is the only John Mayall album I have ever reviewed, and most probably it will just have to stay that way. Because I do respect John Mayall, but at the same time am sort of disinterested in him. The man has had a long, successful, and distinguished career, but, well, you know, people are divided into those who have bands and those who have projects, and Mayall has always struck me as the essential \"project guy\". He has schooled quite a few blistering guitarists and not just guitarists, to be sure, and he's an excellent musician, no doubt about it. And I am not even starting the eternal \"has he / she got / not got SOUL\" discussion. Let's assume he's got a whole barnyard of soul. But he's still that... project guy.\n\nBut now Eric Clapton, he ain't a project guy. At least, not in 1966 he wasn't. After the Yardbirds went non-bluesy, experimental, and \"commercial\", Clapton strove to find happiness with John Mayall, and for about a year he was busy revolutionising the British blues business. With the Yardbirds, he was just another one in a crowd of snotty, ambitious youths with no work experience, little musical knowledge and uncertainty about whether they were more interested in music or fame and fortune. With the Bluesbreakers, there was no mistaking anything: these were serious, hard-working, music-muscular males with beards, grims, and enough technical ability to finally give young Eric a hard time. And we all know young Eric always works best under pressure. (I guess old Eric would, too, but he hasn't been under serious pressure ever since Duane Allman fell off that bike).\n\nMy initial reaction towards the album wasn't exactly overwhelming - hey, a blues album is a blues album; in order to make it into something more than just a blues album you have to have extra class, and I wasn't spotting that much extra class. You might not spot it either, at first. But then I heard all these early Fleetwood Mac albums, which really bored the daylights out of me, and it suddenly dawned upon my psyche that this record, in comparison, ain't boring one percent - on the contrary, it's one of the most wittily constructed \"generic blues\" albums ever. Not each and every song has got an identity of its own, but the sequencing is so brilliant that in between all the shifts you hardly even notice. Provided you do keep attention regarding the shifts.\n\nIn fact, the greatest irony may lie in that John Mayall's Bluesbreakers With Eric Clapton is actually a very, very commercial record - that is, if under \"commercial\" you mean \"easily accessible\" and \"hummable\" and \"diverse\" and all those other words ranging from nice to harmless and not \"heavily advertised on MTV in between all the information about Mariah Carey's Teddy bear collection\". Of course, neither Eric nor John probably thought that at the time, but times change, and today at least I very clearly hear all the pretty little flourishes that Mayall & Co. were inserting in the songs to make them more palpable to the public at large. Eric's playing is actually one of 'em: he may still be copying his blues idols for all we know, but he's got his own (slow) hand going, with funny guitar dialog and broad emotional range and all kinds of weird pre-Hendrix sonic effects and vibratos like you've never heard from Albert King.\n\nAnd that's the first thing you notice, of course - heck, that's the first thing the album wants you to notice, or else why would they be putting Eric's name up in large letters? - but maybe if you have the patience or pleasure to sit through it several times you'll start noticing the rest, like the cleverly placed horns on 'Have You Heard' or Mayall's first-rate keyboard work on 'What'd I Say' or simply the fact that a lot of these songs run at weirdly fast tempos for a pure blues album and that, if they wanted to, a heck of silly teenage boys and girls could dance their asses off to 'Key To Love' or 'Little Girl'; and isn't it a lot of fun to have these fast blues-turned-pop numbers on here?\n\nOf course, it doesn't always work. God only knows how much is the true artistic value of 'Another Man', a rigid, stripped down tune with little else but Mayall's singing and harmonica playing. No one will ever miss the somewhat lengthy drum solo on 'What'd I Say', despite some possible historic significance (how many non-jazz performers were putting drum solos on their records in 1966? Correct answer: the fewer, the better). And, frankly speaking, the songs with no Clapton involvement are generally the most forgettable of the lot (Mose Allison's 'Parchman Farm'). And franklier speaking, the songs with too much Clapton involvement aren't all that hot either, meaning his lone vocal performance on 'Ramblin' On My Mind', where he must have been so nervous about recording his voice for posterity that he forgot to give the song any interesting arrangement or a significant guitar solo.\n\nBut none of that matters once the good stuff starts brewing. And it starts brewing from the very first second, as Eric kicks in with a staggering version of Otis Rush' 'All Your Love'. Yes, the performance is certainly faithful to the original, but the guitar tone is not - sharp in the intro, echoey and dreamy in the slow section, raging and punkish in the fast one. What's really so great about these solos is that they still frequently give us the young angry man in Eric; beginning with Cream, the 'garage streak' in the man would quickly begin to dissipate, but solos like the ones played here in 'Hideaway', 'Key To Love', 'Steppin' Out'... heck, all over the album are true, unquestionable rock'n'roll, totally untampered with.\n\nThe slow numbers can also burn. 'Double Crossin' Time' is said to have been written as a lament on Jack Bruce's leaving the band to join Manfred Mann ('when you feel you have good buddies, they will spin around and cheat you blind'!), and if so, it looks like both Mayall and Eric were really upset about that happening, because the former wails like his very life had been ruined by the fact and the latter gives out a solo whose scorchiness would probably not be matched until the 'Layla'/'Have You Ever Loved A Woman' showcases four years later, and you know what that was all about. (Ironically, the song is also the first showcase for Eric's hypocrisy - in less than a few months, he would repeat Jack's misdemeanour in exactly the same way). And then, a few steps further down the line, he does it again on 'Have You Heard', completely annihilating all the wall-of-sax-o-sound behind him.\n\nIn short, one heck of a major achievement for a Beano lover (funny bit of trivia - that particular Beano issue, No 1242, has now become a rare collector's item due to the album's fame). The only question I still have left, and it still torments me in a major way, is how the heck could this guy alone, in 1966, be playing that-a-way? There's nothing that resembles a \"technique revolution\" a la Hendrix in here, just solid, decisive, ecstatic playing. Why didn't, uh, Brian Jones, or Dick Taylor, or Hilton Valentine play with that much verve? In the States, only Mike Bloomfield was said to be matchin' Eric at the time, but even that, based on my opinion, would be more like half-true (although when it comes to dirty garage-rock par excellence, Mike is certainly a better candidate than Eric). They certainly didn't yell \"give God a solo!\" at Mike Bloomfield concerts.\n\nOne possible answer, of course, is that Eric was God, especially because if God existed, there's probably no way he wouldn't love the Beano. But a more modest hypothesis would be that all these other guys, as good as they were, found their niches in other areas - singing, experimenting with wacky sounds, or just writing awesome melodies. Since \"God\" could not or would not specialize in any of these things, well, what's a poor boy got to do? Just keep practicing.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nERIC CLAPTON\n\nYear Of Release: 1970\n\nRecord rating = 7\n\nOverall rating = 10\n\nSwamped out by session musicians which make it more like a jazz album, but not bad.\n\nBest song: AFTER MIDNIGHT\n\nTrack listing: 1) Slunky; 2) Bad Boy; 3) Lonesome And A Long Way From Home; 4) After Midnight; 5) Easy Now; 6) Blues Power; 7) Bottle Of Red Wine; 8) Lovin' You Lovin' Me; 9) I've Told You For The Last Time; 10) Don't Know Why; 11) Let It Rain.\n\nThe first true Clapton solo album, it immediately strikes you as a weird thing when heard right after the preceding Cream and Blind Faith records. But it's a weird thing if you compare it to his later output, too. There's like about a million guest musicians on this album (which you can all see on the back cover grinning idiotic smiles while Eric modestly sits in a chair and peels himself an orange). However, the main emphasis is made on the brass section - Bobby Keyes and Jim Price, and this makes a hell of a lot of tracks sound like overblown Traffic (which isn't necessarily a very good thing). Predictably, there's not too much Eric himself on here, as this eponymous record would start a trend of other people overshadowing his own identity. Here, besides the already mentioned brass troubadours, Eric's main influence are Bonnie and Delaney Bramlett, of 'Delaney and Bonnie and Friends' fame, a kind of a session player ragbag leaning towards a loose, funky style of performing. The same company, by the way, participated in the recording of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass. But if George was strong enough to resist any serious outside influences and ultimately made the album his and his only (apart from the 'Apple Jam' which almost looked like a generous 'concession'), Eric is much weaker in that respect.\n\nIn fact, I would easily separate the album into the 'Clapton part' and the 'Outside Influences' part; such a gradation is very approximate and mostly based on my personal intuition, but I feel it might be closer to the truth than one could suspect. Fortunately, the 'Clapton part' still persists, making the album sound closer to 'good' than to 'bad'; but for the first time on a Clapton record, there's way too much insignificant filler on the record to mar its reputation. A couple of tracks form some sort of 'bridge', like, for instance, the instrumental jam 'Slunky', a very danceable ditty separated in two parts. It opens with a brass section - some guitar is ringing away in the background, but mostly it's a Price/Keyes duet that I wouldn't rank as one of Keyes' most interesting studio inventions. However, halfway through Eric comes in with loads of soaring, echoey, menacing guitars that sound nothing like Cream, and yet also sound nothing like the kind of sounds he would explore in the future. I would describe these solos as 'psycho Fender blues' as opposed to the 'psycho Gibson blues' of Cream, and believe me, the thing is well worth hearing, because Eric's Fender would never sound as innovative or unusual again in the future.\n\nOtherwise, Eric gets to shine vocally on the somewhat boring blues number 'Bad Boy', and contributes two future live staples of his, both well-known rock classics: 'Blues Power', co-written with Leon Russell, is a mighty catchy life anthem, although to my mind it didn't really come to life until the live versions - when heard on the Dominos' Live At The Fillmore, or on Just One Night, it's bound to blow you away. And, of course, the melody of 'Let It Rain' that serves as the album closer is no great shakes, but one can't deny either the memorability of the main riff or the warm, happy feeling spread all over its five minutes. Can't but tip my hat to the solo, either: the interplay between the quiet heavenly 'call' notes and the acoustic-sounding 'answer' notes in the first break is marvelous, easily one of the moodiest passages on a Clapton record. In concert the song would become endlessly stretched, incorporating drum solos and extended guitar jams, but I really don't feel it's all that necessary: 'Let It Rain' doesn't belong to the class of songs (like 'Got To Get Better In A Little While') that mainly serve as launchpads for jamming, it's in a style of its own and I'm glad there are no drum solos in the original version.\n\nLastly, the 'Clapton part' includes an okayish, decent rocker ('Bottle Of Red Wine') which breathes new life into the definition of 'filler', and a particularly moving ballad ('Easy Now'); I suppose this kind of 'generic' ballad, with hippie overtones and a slight whiff of the Carpenters around it, must have turned off quite a few fans at the moment, but it is still a lot more sincere-sounding and entertaining than quite a fair portion of the fake sweety ballads Clapton did since. I mean, hey, 'Wonderful Tonight' is still a great song, but you can feel it was meant to be an adult contemporary radio staple, while 'Easy Now', with its humble, acoustic-driven melody and unsurmising vocal harmonies, is far closer to actual life as we know it.\n\nThe 'outside influence' half of the record, though, is completely forgettable, with one major exception: the funky, overdriven arrangement of J. J. Cale's 'After Midnight'. Which shows that, after all, it's the songwriting that matters primarily: borrowing a song from such a master as J. J. proved to be a good move, and Eric has been often turning to his material ever since ('Cocaine', anybody?). This particular song has it all: a powerful rhythm, ultracatchy melodical potential, credible singing, and a short, effective, tightly constructed guitar solo. Not to mention that it's fast and danceable - although in concert, Eric would change the arrangement to slow and moody, for unclear reasons.\n\nThe rest of the material is garbage. I detest 'Lonesome And A Long Way From Home' which, to me, embodies all the worst sides of funk - diluted, run-of-the-mill melodies, cheesy background vocals and uniform brass playing, not to mention that there ain't an ounce of Eric on the song. And the trio of tracks 8-10 always pass by me without leaving even a single trace. A gray, stupid ballad in 'Lovin' You Lovin' Me', marred by the same murky overproduction in the background and trite backing vocals; a Stax throwaway in 'Told You For The Last Time'; and an overemotive, banal gospel excourse in 'Don't Know Why'. This wasn't Eric by all means. Unfortunately, it would soon be Eric - but he did rebound for a little while with the Dominos.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nLAYLA AND OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS\n\n(released by DEREK AND THE DOMINOS)\n\nYear Of Release: 1970\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 12\n\nOverrated, but still a classic. Skip through the 'assorted love songs', actually, and there you are.\n\nBest song: LAYLA\n\nTrack listing: 1) I Looked Away; 2) Bell Bottom Blues; 3) Keep On Growing; 4) Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out; 5) I Am Yours; 6) Anyday; 7) Key To The Highway; 8) Tell The Truth; 9) Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?; 10) Have You Ever Loved A Woman; 11) Little Wing; 12) It's Too Late; 13) Layla; 14) Thorn Tree In The Garden.\n\nDeeming probably that the time was still not right for launching a true solo career, Eric dubbed himself Derek and hired a part of Delaney, Bonny and Friends to become his back-ups the Dominos. These were Jim Gordon on drums, Bobby Whitlock on keyboards and Carl Radle on base (the latter would afterwards become part of Eric's regular back-up band). Joining forces with the notorious guitarist Duane Allman, they went on the road, interrupted touring in order to produce this (and only this) album, went back on the road again, and dispersed soon afterwards because, so it seemed, Clapton just couldn't tolerate a real band any more. Well, he should have known better.\n\nMost people rave wild about Layla, claiming this to be one of the greatest rock albums ever - to the point that even many Clapton haters admit that this one record really redeems his butt. So when I was buying it I was expecting something phenomenal, but... Surprise surprise. There are lots of good songs here, but there's lots of filler as well - very well played and produced filler, but filler nevertheless. And by 'filler' I don't just mean songs that have no particular place to go - I also mean that there's quite a lot of passages, jams, instrumental 'flirtations', etc., on here, that were just made for fun and never intended as 'artistically relevant'. Think the third disc of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, right? Of course, these jams never take so much time as Harrison's jams, and they're usually more diverse and pleasant to the ear, but their purpose is more or less the same.\n\nAs the title suggests, this is primarily a 'love songs' album, and this is the root of its main defects. A good deal of these 'love songs' are so naive and unmelodic that one even wonders what the fuss was all about; and too many of them just look like their only intent was to provide a 'jamming space' where Clapton and Allman could insert their solos - which are sometimes blistering and sometimes not, it's mainly hit and miss. You might accuse me of controversy - after all, Clapton's work in Cream might seem to have been structured around the same pattern. And that's right, but the very point is that it was structured: Clapton took the time to work on his solos in the studio, and Cream studio records never relied on spontaneous improvisation (they always left that aspect of their music for the live shows - and these were eventually hit and miss, too). The Dominos, on the other hand, mostly improvise: heck, everybody knows that the reason why 'Key To The Highway' fades in is because the band was simply jamming mindlessly in the studio while the tapes were rolling... Sometimes it works, like on that same 'Key To The Highway', but quite often, it really doesn't.\n\nThe opening number, 'I Looked Away', may be memorable, but it's just too stupid for me (lyrics, maybe - the album is really hard on lyrics, but there's something really annoying about lines like 'She took my hand/And tried to make me understand/That she would always be there'). Oh, it's not that bad, come to think of it, but hey, I don't see no particular reason why it could not have been written by - say - The Band, for example. Very routine-looking stuff.\n\nBut if you consider 'I Am Yours', 'co-written' by Eric with Nizami's spirit (in other words, it's Nizami's poetry, translated into English, of course, set to a melody by Eric), it turns out to be just dull and it should never have made it on an album like this. A bland, sappy love ballad, and it doesn't even have a wonderful guitar line like 'Wonderful Tonight'. Likewise, the album closer, 'Thorn Tree In The Garden', written and sung by Bobby Whitlock, is a stately bore: slow, lethargic, with a diluted and hard-to-grab melody. Two more average songs - 'Anyday' and 'Keep On Growing' - just don't seem to make the matter any better (although, I must confess, the guitar duel between Duane and Eric on the latter is spectacular). The cover version of Jimi Hendrix's 'Little Wing' is not bad, but inferior to the live recording found on Rainbow Concert (I'm probably alone on this one, but I wouldn't want to go into details right now). The only gem among these gray stones is 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?', and that's only because of its breackneck tempo and great solos; even so, I far prefer the live version on Fillmore, where Eric manages to surpass with his lone guitar the things that both his and Duane's guitar achieve on the studio version.\n\nBut wait! No sooner do we abandon the love themes and turn ourselves to straight blues playing than we have absolute, gorgeous, breathtaking classics! The almost ten-minute jam 'Key To The Highway' is worth every minute of it, with Eric and Duane interchanging solos, and it's live in the studio - guess there were certain moments when everything gelled so perfectly for these guys. The bearded blues 'Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out' (the oldest song on here, it was written by Jimmy Cox in the Twenties) is given the appropriate electric treatment, 'Tell The Truth' is a piece of slow-moving, plodding comic blues with a catchy melody and some groovy sound effects in the beginning, while 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman' is just ultra-traditional blues with some ferocious soloing by Eric: this number was intentionally selected by Eric, since its lyrics dealing with adultery ('have you ever loved a woman so much it's a shame and a sin?/All the time you know she belongs to your very best friend') are a direct hint at Eric's urges for Patti Boyd, George Harrison's wife. Eric solos like a demon, too. And you know what's the funniest thing about the song? Try and compare it to 'Have You Heard' from the infamous John Mayall record and you'll see that Eric is actually imitating his old bandmaster - trying to sing with the same falsetto. When he bleats out 'yeaaaaaas' in between the lines, it's almost as if Mr Mayall is speaking right from inside of Eric. Groovy, isn't it? Of course, it also goes to show that by then Eric still hadn't developed his vocal style.\n\nThe same love obviously inspired Eric for the title track on the album - the real highlight, and an absolute timeless classic. Besides having a great riff which is probably Eric's most memorable riff ever (although he later confessed he stole it from somewhere), it also boasts some heavenly guitar interplay between Eric and Duane the likes of which you will probably not hear anywhere or anytime else, before suddenly switching off into a nice moody piano-driven jam with some more solos and driving you totally frantic. That jam is, in fact, like the ultimate climactic passage on the album: gorgeous as just about anything on Harrison's All Things Must Pass, contemplative and beautifully arranged - there are so many different instruments and parties that you can always return to the song and still find something entirely new...\n\nMy final judgement: don't mind the filler material, which you might as well love if your tastes differ from mine, go straight ahead and get this album, be it even for the fact alone that this is an acknowledged rock classic. I originally gave it a ten - but then I finally understood that I was deceiving myself, and the last straw was when I found out - to my big surprise - that I actually put Live At The Fillmore on much, much more frequently. So I bravely swapped the ratings - of course, I do not invite you to do the same thing, but I must say that the raw atmosphere on the Dominos' live record grabs me far, far more tightly than the somewhat more relaxed and even 'countryish' atmosphere of Layla. Mark Prindle once accused the record of being way too 'rednecky', and while I do not at all agree with him, I can see his point: few songs on here really stand out. This is a very even, smooth, and unexciting record - you have to really let it sink deep deep down into you to enjoy it fully. So I prefer the rough, edgy sound of Fillmore, which actually rocks harder and grittier - if you can believe me.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nLIVE AT THE FILLMORE\n\n(released by DEREK AND THE DOMINOS)\n\nYear Of Release: 1973-94\n\nRecord rating = 10\n\nOverall rating = 13\n\nSome of the most magnificent leads ever captured on tape, even if not much else.\n\nBest song: WHY DOES LOVE GOT TO BE SAD?\n\nTrack listing: CD I: 1) Got To Get Better In A Little While; 2) Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad; 3) Key To The Highway; 4) Blues Power; 5) Have You Ever Loved A Woman; 6) Bottle Of Red Wine;\n\nCD II: 1) Tell The Truth; 2) Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out; 3) Roll It Over; 4) Presence Of The Lord; 5) Little Wing; 6) Let It Rain; 7) Crossroads.\n\nFirst of all, let me explain the curious date. This album was originally released as Derek & The Dominos In Concert in 1973, but Polydor made everybody a huge favour by re-releasing it under the current title - with some tracks changed for better versions and some bonuses, as well as remixing it to a truly incredible state. As you see, even fat money guys sometimes make intelligent decisions.\n\nIf you're thinking about making a full collection of the Dominos' output, don't hesitate to grab this one - together with Layla, it's bound to fully satisfy your dreams. What it does represent is Clapton at his technical, emotional and artistic peak, with a highly professional and skillful backing band. And what else do you want? The track list relies mostly on material from Layla (which wasn't even officially released back when the actual shows were played) and Eric's self-titled solo album, plus a couple of oldies ('Crossroads', 'Presence Of The Lord') and a couple obscure singles ('Got To Get Better In A Little While', 'Roll It Over'). Most of the songs, as one can easily guess, are widely and largely extended and could easily have passed for simple and boring lengthy wank-a-thons. Indeed, a lot of people will probably favour this opinion even after hearing this album. To my ears, though, the lengthy instrumental passages at the worst sound okay, while at the best they can only be described with the well-known cliche of 'rock nirvana'.\n\nIn fact, after about a year of listening I have come to the definite conclusion that I like this stuff better than Layla - and that's a fact. Oh sure, there is no Duane Allman present on the album, as he never was an official member of the band and never joined them onstage, which means that, try as he might, Clapton simply cannot reproduce the spectacular 'guitar battles' of Layla. But, being the straightforward honest guy he is, he makes everything possible to compensate for the lack of a second guitarist: after all, all of his previous career passed under the sign 'you might be God in the studio, but you're double God onstage'. And this results in the fact that on NO OTHER live Clapton album will you hear such incredible, unimaginable passages of guitar power and beauty as on this album. What Clapton does on here easily beats out Duane Allman, easily beats out Hendrix, easily beats out anybody; it's currently my favourite guitar solo album in the world, and I seriously suspect it will stay that way forever. Basically, Eric does everything within the limits of 'no guitar hooliganry allowed': if you're accustomed to his trademark 'soft' style, the wah-wah chaos of the intro to 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' or the mind-blowing trills of 'Tell The Truth' will rip you out of your chair. The next time Eric would even start approaching this level of guitar mastery would be twenty-four years later, on From The Cradle.\n\nThe album kicks off with the already mentioned 'Got To Get Better...', and from the very start you realize that you're in for a very special performance. Instead of slow, moody and druggy sonic journeys that Eric specialized on in Cream, he plays wild, fast'n'furious, sincere and incredibly emotional blues solos which on first listen seem to grab you by the collar and squeeze your throat till you're breathless. Not to mention, of course, the rhythm section - it's so intense and aurally attractive that you'd never believe it was the same guys who backed Eric on the studio album. For Layla, most of your attention is only drawn by the guitarists; here, the rhythm players (except possibly Carl Radle, who's just solidly holding down the basslines) do everything to grab your attention. Bobby Whitlock's piano pounds away as if it were substituting an accompanying rhythm guitar - which it really is - and sets a fascinating groove: instead of embellishing the sound, it stands at its very core. And then, of course, there's Jim Gordon. Man, that drumming drives me whacko. He doesn't even drum - he swings, in the only true and authentic meaning of the word, setting a tense, sharp, paranoid beat which digs deep into the very fibres of your soul. If you're not tapping your foot and bobbing your head and shaking like a leaf on a tree by the first seconds of the intro, you're definitely not human.\n\nAnd now it's time to shoot for the grand prize - the lead on the follow-up, 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?', is probably one of the fiercest cries of love and sorrow I've ever heard! It's not as fast or technically fluent as on the studio version, but it's tons more emotional, and Eric manages to virtually keep you in a state of musical orgasm for two or three minutes before he calms down and resumes singing. And when I say 'musical orgasm', I don't just mean 'feeling good' - practically every note he squeezes out is ecstatic, painful, screeching, completely berserk - check out the agonizing wails of his instrument at 5:14 into the song in particular. To say it leaves me breathless is to say nothing. Unfortunately, soon afterwards the song degenerates into a slow and relaxed shuffle, but that's really not a very serious problem - after a while, you actually get used to the shuffle and come to realize that it only sounds a bit more boring because nothing in the world can match that immaculate solo.\n\nI won't go into details, though: the performances are not really that diverse, and, however terrific the highlights are, the record does get a bit monotonous - simply put, the similarity of arrangements can wear you down a little if you listen to both discs without a break (you probably shouldn't - don't let it spoil the pleasure). I'll just point out the culmination pieces where Eric, to me at least, seems to be really playing his heart out. 'Blues Power' is rip-roaring, with lots of hot, fiery solos that are indeed running on a lot of blues power. There's also a supercharged version of 'Little Wing', not at all inferior to the studio version; and a slowed down, but nevertheless quite captivating 'Crossroads' (with Eric suddenly singing the line 'squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg'. Hey, was the man boozing with Robert Plant the other night?) Whatever; that riff still rules and will always rule.\n\nBut I'm not going to go on like this, because if we speak in terms of Eric's guitarplaying, these performances all qualify, and quite often they overshadow the studio originals - like 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman', for example. I tell you - if you're not allergic on guitar solos from the beginning, you'll have no regrets for the extended running time of most of them. They deserve it, with some minor exceptions ('Tell The Truth' is a good song, but puffing it up with a jam seems somewhat out of place; then again, the jam is as powerful as... ah, shucks. There are simply no bad performances here).\n\nI therefore bravely award the album a 10. The decision is indeed brave, because, apart from the instrumental skills of Eric and the band, there's little else to recommend this album for. The singing is mostly horrible - Clapton hasn't yet truly discovered his singing talents. He manages to pull off the fast numbers because he has to pronounce all the words in a flurry, but most of the slow ones, where he gotta stretch out, are so horrible in that respect you can't help thinking about when he's gonna shut up and play that six-string instead. 'Presence Of The Lord' is particularly murky in that respect: no wonder he'd left it to Steve Winwood on the Blind Faith album, while in the future it would be sung by Yvonne Elliman. However, 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman' and 'Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out' come close (the latter would later be sung by Marcy Levy. Eh?) Nevertheless, I prefer to simply close my eyes on that fact and just enjoy the performances - the solo on 'Presence Of The Lord' kicks butt, and 'Nobody Loves You' still comes out as pretty tense and emotional.\n\nThere are also some minor defects - much as I adore Jim Gordon's work, I prefer him to accompany, not to lead, and his stupid (even if impressive) solo on 'Let It Rain' towards the end of the album annoys the heck out of me. Also, for some strange reason they don't do 'Layla'. Surely it had been written by that time? Hey, what was the problem? I'd better have 'Layla' on here than... than... well, than 'Bottle Of Red Wine', for instance. Although, of course, I would have no problem with both being included.\n\nStill, it's just one of those cases where you must close your eyes on a certain flaw. After all, it's not Eric's fault that he hadn't yet learned to sing - it's a wonder he actually did bring up a good singing voice in the future. And these guys certainly did not need no vocalist-frontman - their credo was mainly instrumental. In any case, the solo on 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' alone is worth pushing up the record's rating to the extreme. A tremendously important historical document it is, and a fascinating listening experience as well. If you happen to be a blues hater, give Fillmore a try - and if the raw power, feeling, anger, sorrow, and sometimes fun in these solos does not get straight to your heart, then you and blues are simply incompatible, in which case I can't but feel sorry for you.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nRAINBOW CONCERT\n\nYear Of Release: 1973\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nCertainly a unique, if not flawless, concert, and historical value is not the only thing that redeems it.\n\nBest song: LITTLE WING\n\nTrack listing: 1) Layla; 2) Badge; 3) Blues Power; 4) Roll It Over; 5) Little Wing; 6) Bottle Of Red Wine; 7) After Midnight; 8) Bell Bottom Blues; 9) Presence Of The Lord; 10) Tell The Truth; 11) Pearly Queen; 12) Key To The Highway; 13) Let It Rain; 14) Crossroads.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Dominos, Eric became close friends with Mr Heroin and stayed in intimate relations with him for almost three years (only separating with him for a single moment to participate in George Harrison's Bangladesh concert), until by the beginning of 1973 he was pulled out of his addiction by Pete Townshend. The latter, apparently fed up with The Who for a while and also feeling mighty sorry for Eric, recruited an all-star supergroup, put Eric at the head of it and made him play two gigs at the Rainbow Theatre in London. The supergroup presented here was a true mess, but a true supergroup at that: Pete and Eric borrowed some people from Eric's past (Steve Winwood, keyboards; Rick Grech, base, both from Blind Faith), some additional Traffic veterans (Jim Capaldi on drums, Rebop on percussion), one more drummer (Jimmy Karstein), Ronnie Wood and Pete Townshend. Have I forgotten anybody? Oh, yeah, and Eric, of course - on 'third rhythm-guitar', as Pete jokingly presented him.\n\nWith such an overabundance of players, guitars and other instruments, it certainly was a pain in the ass to produce the resulting album; featuring just about five or six tracks, the original release was so poorly mixed that nobody at the time could truly appreciate the value of this concert, except its historical value: after all, it was not only an extremely curious project, but it was also a project that marked Clapton's rebirth, pulling him out back to life again; in fact, he is still grateful to Townshend for having saved his career and maybe even his life. But historical value aside, is it really listenable?\n\nWell, nowadays it is (I haven't heard the original, so maybe the poorness of the sound was exaggerated, but I'm certainly not going to hunt for a used vinyl copy just to satisfy my curiosity). The recent CD re-release, following the excellent re-release of Live At The Fillmore, has everything remixed and more than doubles the number of tracks. Thus it becomes a true gem, featuring two great guitarists (three, if you count Ronnie Wood as a great guitarist) in top form, and, what's more, the general atmosphere is free of boredom and dullness. Not that Clapton is in his best form, of course. Drugs had really brought him down, or maybe it was just the inner crisis eating him out - he'd already begun experiencing the \"guitar hero complex\" - but his guitar sound on this record is far less bold and daring than on the previous live album. For the most part, Eric abandons the fuzz and wah-wah, uses the same Gibson tone throughout (yes, he seems to be playing a Gibson here, not having yet switched completely to Fenders), and sounds far more relaxed, smooth and 'accessible' than ever before. But he never loses even a single part of his amazing fluency and dexterity, and most of the leads on the record are intelligent enough and utterly pleasant. Not AWESOME in huge red capital letters: just pleasant and catchy, atmospheric and, well, just nice. But isn't one nice solo from Clapton worth a dozen awesome solos from Dave Gilmour?\n\nThe concert opens with a great rendition of 'Layla', with the instrumental jam at the end carefully preserved and lovingly executed; then the band ploughs on through a selection of Eric's earlies - songs from Layla ('Key To The Highway', 'Tell The Truth', an incredibly genuine 'Bell Bottom Blues', and especially 'Little Wing' which is not quite up to the standard of the Fillmore version, but still manages to obliterate the studio Layla version; besides, hearing Eric sing this in a duet with Pete really brings tears to my eyes, and the emotion in the solos is still exceptional), Eric Clapton (a rather weak 'Blues Power', although this song was never really strong until Eric's 1979-1980 band tightened it up; a great rendition of 'Bottle Of Red Wine'; a completely redone version of 'After Midnight' - slower, gloomier and grittier; and the stage favourite 'Let It Rain', of course, with an obligatory drum solo), Blind Faith ('Presence Of The Lord' with Steve Winwood singing lead vocals - a welcome change from Fillmore, where Eric almost managed to spoil the picture with his own weak ones), and even his Cream period (a ferocious 'Badge', punctuated by Townshend block chords; 'Crossroads', although at a much slower tempo than the version found on Wheels On Fire). Rarities include 'Roll It Over', done in a different way from the Dominos version, and 'Pearly Queen' - a Traffic number probably done at the bidding of so many Traffic guest stars. Accidentally, it also happens to be my favourite Traffic song, but I still don't get the sense of the final chaotic jam.\n\nAll the playing is very well done and it's obvious that everybody's having a good time. The reissue also preserves all the stage banter, which is well worth hearing: there's a lot of jokes, mostly on Pete's part (Pete's a famous banterer, after all - remember the groovy Live At Leeds chatter?), and in all this album is a great listen. Worth buying at least because of the fact that never ever was there again such a supergroup as this, and nowhere else will you hear Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend playing and singing together. While I would never indeed put it on the same level with Fillmore, I still feel the concert isn't really given its due by the critics. Eric's live playing would never be the same after that - that amazing, perfect fluency that had characterized all his work from Cream up till now is still here, but it would soon be gone, and his leads on subsequent albums, with a couple notable exceptions, all sound somewhat clumsy as compared to the strong, swiftly and smoothly running torrents of notes he hits on the best leads at Rainbow Concert. Aww...\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\n461 OCEAN BOULEVARD\n\nYear Of Release: 1974\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nBlues? Nope. Reggae and country, that's what that one is about. But it's rather nice.\n\nBest song: I SHOT THE SHERIFF\n\nTrack listing: 1) Motherless Children; 2) Willie And The Hand Jive; 3) Get Ready; 4) I Shot The Sheriff; 5) I Can't Hold Out; 6) Please Be With Me; 7) Let It Grow; 8) Steady Rollin' Man; 9) Mainline Florida; 10) Give Me Strength.\n\nThe first, the most renowned and verily arguably the best of Eric's post-Dominos solo albums (if you don't count the live ones and the tribute ones, like From The Cradle). One thing is obvious when you take your first listen - it was recorded according to the golden rule of 'Oh No Solo'. This, unfortunately, was Eric's stupidly self-imposed \"guitar hero complex\" curse that haunted him for twenty years - not until From The Cradle was he completely cured of his rashness. For, try as he may, he's just not that much of a composer. And when an average composer but a great guitarist suddenly turns away from the guitar and takes up composing... what do you call that? I call it folly. It is perfectly understandable, of course: he wanted to prove the world there was more to him than just endless jamming sessions. He probably did, but that's no consolation... at least, not to me. From now on, the Clapton legacy would be just an acquired taste: he got himself some new fans, earned himself enough radio airplay on conservative stations, got rid of some elder fans who wanted more Cream-style material, and ceased to play an important part in the development of rock whatsoever. I still \"continue loving\" the guy, as his new, 'relaxed' style is tasteful enough for my liking, but I don't blame any former fans for deserting the ship either. Just show some respect, will ya? Eric is such a friendly, cheerful guy after all...\n\nThat said, 461 Ocean Boulevard is definitely far from a completely 'guitar-empty' album. I suppose the record still holds up after all those years exactly because Clapton's playing, while not exactly the finger-flashing technological wonder of old, is still inventive and diverse enough to interest the average fan. Sticking to minimalistic, restrained lines, Clapton displays an excellent variety of styles he really didn't care about earlier. Smooth, brilliantly flowing \"distorted slide\" playing on 'Motherless Children'; a strange 'hoarse ringing' tone on 'Willie And The Hand Jive'; fat, atmospheric Mountain-esque lines on 'I Can't Hold Out'; heavenly wailing and emotional steel guitar on 'Let It Grow'; weird electronic effects on 'Mainline Florida' - aw, come on, there's enough interesting guitar tricks on here to prove that at this point at least, Clapton still cared more about his six-string than about his image as a 'crowd-pleasing roots-rock guy'.\n\nMoreover, I know I'm going to contradict myself, but I'm gonna say it: this album features at least one ultra-fantastic song composed in its entirety by Eric himself - the gorgeous ballad 'Let It Grow' which I would prefer to 'Stairway To Heaven' every single day of my life. In a perfect world it would have definitely been revered higher - no overblown misty mysticism, as far as I can get it, and a cathartic feeling induced not by an intentional use of \"heavenly solos\", but by one of the simplest things on earth - a looping, \"spiralling\" repetition of the song's main riff. That terrific coda, with the guitars and backing synthesizers rising in unison to a mighty climax before fading away... I simply call that magic. That's what music does to people.\n\nOther highlights of this 'first try' are Eric's cover of Bob Marley's 'I Shot The Sheriff' which did more to popularize reggae than Bob could ever hope for (I wonder, though, whether it was such a good thing). This is a definite classic and a stage favourite; while Bob Marley was never one of my favourite composers, a little bit of reggae really can't hurt now and then, and I'd rather listen to 'I Shot The Sheriff' in among some of the other musical styles than have to digest a whole album of reggae (Marley fans don't crucify me - I respect the man profoundly, but I don't find enough diversity in his work to keep me entertained all day. Which may eventually change, of course).\n\nYou also have your 'Steady Rollin' Man' (Robert Johnson's, of course) which is the only real blues number here, and so does feature a solo (at last!) But most of the other material is rather second-rate, like the dull countryish 'Willy And The Hand Jive', or the grungier 'I Can't Hold Out', or the sweety-sugary ballad 'Please Be With Me', or the sweaty steamy sexy 'Get Ready' with Eric singing a duet with Yvonne Elliman. Most of them are still redeemed by some of those classy guitar tricks I've mentioned previously, and the record rarely becomes a drag. In fact, it's currently one of my favourite records to play air guitar to - it was made for the purpose! Dig the weirdness of George Terry's 'Mainline Florida', too, with those cool \"underwater\" wah-wah tones and, as far as I get it, the first apparition on record of the famous \"piggy tone\" that was later rendered popular with Pink Floyd's 'Pigs'. Plus, songs like 'Give Me Strength' add their fair share of emotional beauty to the album - the vibe of 'Presence Of The Lord' was still strong in Eric, and so he was able to make a song sound completely commercial and completely convincing at the same time.\n\nBy the way, I forgot to tell that this album was recorded with Eric's newly assembled American band: Carl Radle on base, Nick Simms on keyboards, George Terry on second guitar (to him Eric relegated much of his own soloing), Jamie Oldaker on drums and Yvonne Elliman (of Jesus Christ Superstar and later of Saturday Night Fever fame) on backing vocals. Marcy Levy (future Shakespeare's Sister) joined a bit later - in 1975. Oh well, anyway, it doesn't matter that much. Do backing bands really matter that much? Still - maybe they do, at least for Eric. He used to give his band members such great privileges that he even didn't dare to fire them at will.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nTHERE'S ONE IN EVERY CROWD\n\nYear Of Release: 1975\n\nRecord rating = 7\n\nOverall rating = 10\n\nEric getting as far away from Clapton as possible, yet compensating it with diversity and... er... solid songwriting? Wahtever.\n\nBest song: BETTER MAKE IT THROUGH TODAY\n\nTrack listing: 1) We've Been Told (Jesus Coming Soon); 2) Swing Low Sweet Chariot; 3) Little Rachel; 4) Don't Blame Me; 5) The Sky Is Crying; 6) Singin' The Blues; 7) Better Make It Through Today; 8) Pretty Blue Eyes; 9) High; 10) Opposites.\n\nI guess I was really harsh on that one in my original review. Basically, I just called it idiotic for the continuous betrayal of Eric's guitar identity and dismissed most of the songs because they were generic, pointless and inessential. Times change, however, and while I will never accept the point of view shared by some of the fans (namely, that it's one of Eric's peaks - yup, I'm not joking), it is well worth realising that there are next to no bad songs on here, so why should we complain all that much? Okay, maybe one or two bad tunes, but the rest range from enjoyable to excellently written and performed, so I was really smug and could have used a good lecture on biases and presuppositions when I was penning the old review.\n\nActually, There's One In Every Crowd is one of Eric's most eclectic records, if not the most eclectic - he's treading water with a severe mix of blues, reggae, gospel, and pop balladeering, and while too many of these tracks seem to just stand right up in your face and holler out \"We're blues! We're reggae! We're gospel!\" (for comparison, the Stones were never all that obvious on their 'roots encyclopaedia'-type records), it's still a diverse and fascinating enough collection. Add to this Clapton's talents as an arranger, guitar player and singer - his voice gets better all the time - and you got yourself a nice little LP that'll definitely put you into a good mood if you wish for it. A higher rating than an overall 10 is out of the question, of course, because it's... well, it's just a cute tiny inoffensive toy. But nice.\n\nThe composition of the album looks somewhat strange to me, though - the first side is \"faster\" or \"rougher\", whatever, with all the gospel-blues-reggae jackpot, and the second side is almost entirely dedicated to ballads; perhaps it would be wiser to intersperse the tracks, but maybe Eric had his own ideas about the record structure, I don't really know. Anyway, the first side, from a \"limited expectations\" perspective, appears to be nearly flawless - the only track that can fall into the \"eh\" category is Eric's half-assed 'sequel' to 'I Shot The Sheriff', the reggae number 'Don't Blame Me'. Sequels normally suck unless they're Sierra adventure games, and this one's hardly an exception, especially taken together with Eric's exaggerated whining on the verses. But the rest is okay. 'We've Been Told (Jesus Is Coming Soon)' forms a funny gospel intro to the album, great stuff to tap your feet to. Eric's reggae re-arrangement of the traditional 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' is catchy beyond measure, and further aided by Yvonne Elliman's great soulful rendition of the second verse. No wonder she played Mary Magdalene in Jesus Christ Superstar (to quote Gabriel Knight - 'Mary Magdalene, ooh, what a babe'). 'Little Rachel' is a lazy blues shuffle with some excellent guitar licks and a strange, slyly ominous feel to it. Basically, I just like that style - I don't really think that anybody did it like that before Clapton, that 'lazy blues shuffle' with a very quiet volume level and acute subdued ting-tingy \"teasing\" licks all over the place. Okay, maybe J. J. Cale did, and later on some of that atmosphere would be caught on by Dire Straits, but for me, this style will still always be associated with Eric.\n\nThe side closes out with a faithful moody rendition of Elmore James' 'The Sky Is Crying' (very atmospheric organ/piano/guitar interplay on that one), then the second side opens with another acceptable gospel crooning ('Singin' The Blues'), and then it's time for all those ballads. Many diehards consider this side to be one of the best bunches of heartfelt ballads Clapton had ever written, but this here nasty sceptical reviewer has his reservations on the case. Okay, 'Better Make It Through Today' is brilliant: nice atmosphere, romantic, enchanting vocals, and a wonderful 'resolution' of the melody with the injection of a \"pause\" in between the third and fourth line. But 'Pretty Blue Eyes' and 'High', while not bad songs per se, strike me as being eminently interchangeable - both are based on the same fast upbeat part/slow heavenly part opposition, and if I'm not paying attention, I hardly even notice when one of them stops and the other one starts. This side has also often been compared by Clapton fans with the Beatles' balladeering style on Abbey Road, but it certainly lacks the Beatles' catchiness and diversity, and besides, the main similarity to me seems in Clapton's \"borrowing\" of the opening lines to 'Because' for 'Opposites'.\n\nSo it's easy to see why this album has never fared well among the general public, always pushed back by worthier candidates like Ocean Boulevard and Slowhand - while most of the songs are at least 'okay', there's nothing eminently gripping about them in order for at least one of them to achieve 'classic' status. It's a good polygon for displaying Eric's eclectic tastes, and it's certainly far less slick than most of the product that followed it (even if it is pretty slick - well, we're talking about Tom Dowd production here, after all, and the man was always famous for sucking \"raw life\" out of roots rock compositions), but nothing really sticks out. In all respects, not just in the 'Don't Blame Me' one, it's just a sequel to Ocean Boulevard, and like I said, sequels tend to suck. Unless, of course, we're dealing with a Sierra adventure game. Unless, of course, it ain't King's Quest VIII, which is just about the worst offence to a Sierra adventure game I've ever witnessed in my life.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nE. C. WAS HERE\n\nYear Of Release: 1975\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 12\n\nTerrific live sound: Eric never loses it!\n\nBest song: HAVE YOU EVER LOVED A WOMAN\n\nTrack listing: 1) Have You Ever Loved A Woman; 2) Presence Of The Lord; 3) Drifting Blues; 4) Can't Find My Way Home; 5) Rambling On My Mind; 6) Further On Up The Road.\n\nHere's some advice for you: if you're not the one who's ready to lick Eric's toes even when he's doing trash like 'Behind The Mask' or 'River Of Tears', you might dismiss any of his studio albums (you'd be making a mistake, of course, but not a fatal one), but don't you miss the live ones. It's just such a rare example of a career when most of the live performances are way, way above the studio recordings. You see, Eric might have abandoned his earlier experimentative efforts and his crafted guitarplayership on his recent releases, but he was still giving it away on concerts, and for once the record company had made a wise decision to go ahead and release a live album in addition to his last melting pot of gospel, balladeering and 'soft blues'. In doing so, they probably produced Eric's best ever solo concert album since 1973 - E. C. Was Here captures the man with his dextrous American backing band in particularly good form, and the sound is raw and fresh if compared to later live releases like Just One Night and 24 Nights, where the production and arranging would be a bit too sterile for my - and everybody else's - tastes. Unfortunately, this one boasts just six tracks, and even the recent re-release hasn't beefed up the number (they did reinstate 'Drifting' to the original eleven minutes version, though).\n\nBut even so, that doesn't mean you don't have to enjoy the album. Most of the songs you know already, but some of them take on a different life. First of all, the record has the definite version of 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman', the least stereotypic, the most inventive one. The way Eric abrupts the verses and lets the guitar end the phrase that began life as a sung one is incredible - it's like a self-dialog between a man and his guitar. It does throw you a bit off balance at first when after the George Terry-Eric soloing duet Eric goes \"George Terry, please... so much! and you know you can't leave her 'lone\", but soon you'll get used to it - sheer genius. And the actual fencing guitar-match is nothing short of breathtaking: Terry might not have been as talented, but he was a perfect base for Eric to lean upon and entwine his own soloing around his guitar.\n\nThen there's a good version of 'Presence Of The Lord' with Yvonne Elliman helping Eric to pull off the singing without much pain (like on Live At The Fillmore). This version, unfortunately, is far from the definite one - Yvonne also renders this song much more generic with her soul singing, and the way they stretch out the verses, playing the song twice as slow as the original, is uncomfy, but it's all compensated by the searing solo in the middle; Eric simply can't go wrong on that one. In any case, notice the huge differences in his current singing: four years ago, the song would be sung completely off key, but now Mr Clapton is fully confident, and while he overemotes a bit on the opening lines, it's a great pleasure to hear him wallow in his newly-found vocal strength.\n\nThe currently-eleven minutes 'Drifting Blues' is okay: overlong, maybe, but certainly pleasant. It's actually a demonstration of how even an 'average' Clapton jam might be a great experience if you let yourself be carried away with it: I can't help but admire the man's inventiveness and expressivity which he achieves even without applying any of his ultra-complicated playing techniques. These solos flow around you so flawlessly, seamlessly, effortlessly, they seem so natural and, hell, rational without the least sign of self-indulgence that all of the song's eleven minutes just pass by like it were three or four. The brilliant change of guitar tones alone is worth a fortune. Wonder why Eric felt a need to insert a couple of verses from 'Ramblin' On My Mind' if he also got to perform the song separately?\n\n'Can't Find My Way Home', one of the best tunes on Blind Faith, again has Yvonne doing most of the singing job, and Clapton shines on the acoustic. And the record ends with a couple more highlights: growling, menacing, magnificently built 'Rambling On My Mind' (don't these opening notes send a shiver down your spine?) and a jolly good and fast version of the old R'n'B tune 'Further On Up The Road' which would become a stage favourite from now on.\n\nThe record does show a serious change of style from Eric's 'classic' live period in the Dominos, of course. Like I already mentioned, his guitarwork is somewhat more restrained: certainly far more prominent than on contemporary studio records, but lacking the flashiness, speed and recklessness of old. He also relies far less on various special effects - for instance, the once so beloved wah-wah is completely forgotten (it would resurface later, but only in a limited number of occasions), and the tones he chooses are softer and more 'inoffensive' than before. On the other hand, the album has a charm of its own that's lacking on the \"rougher\" records - Eric's blistering minimalism on 'Ramblin' On My Mind' and 'Drifting' is a perfect example of achieving so much with so little.\n\nThe only deeply strange thing about the album is its cover - and to make matters even more bizarre, the back cover features a close-up of the same female's BUTTS. Rarely have I seen such a gruesome \"non-matching\" of a record and its sleeve. Wonder what the producers were thinking? Especially since Eric never ever was intended to be marketed as a \"raunchy one\". Somebody got stoned, most probably.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nNO REASON TO CRY\n\nYear Of Release: 1976\n\nRecord rating = 6\n\nOverall rating = 9\n\nA Band album. A Dylan album. A Marcy Levy album. Eric Clapton? Who's that?\n\nBest song: SIGN LANGUAGE\n\nTrack listing: 1) Beautiful Thing; 2) Carnival; 3) Sign Language; 4) County Jail Blues; 5) All Our Past Times; 6) Hello Old Friend; 7) Double Trouble; 8) Innocent Times; 9) Hungry; 10) Black Summer Rain; 11) Last Night.\n\nThis is not exactly a bad record, and it has its share of nice tasty numbers that are worth memorizing - however, apart from the cover of 'Double Trouble', none of these songs lasted long as stage favourites, and it's easy to see why. Sadly, the true Eric Clapton is not to be found on this album: more precisely, you have to really dig deep in order to dig out some true Eric Clapton, and you could easily spare yourself the challenge and just go back to Layla or even Ocean Boulevard. I mean, yeah, some of the music is endurable, but can't you see it's not Eric? Just look at the credits: The Band, Ronnie Wood, Dylan, Jesse Ed Davis and tons and tons of session musicians. Even Georgie Fame. Eric is simply lost among this sea of guests. As if this wasn't enough, check the authorship. Most of the tracks on here are either Dylan songs or Band songs, or, at worst, Marcy Levy songs, which is no reassuring news, either. After all, this is the same Marcy Levy that later formed Shakespeare's Sister, remember? Ggggggod...\n\nSeriously, while over time I have come to appreciate this record more (as was the case with most Seventies' Clapton records that are in any case bound to grow on you like no other roots rock artist creations can), this is undoubtedly Eric's worst offering of the decade. The whole event took place in the Band's studio which had once been a bordello (sic!) and that's very symbolizing - this is a mess. Not exactly a drunken one, but stuff like 'Carnival' does hint a bit at certain intoxicating devices. And while I respect the Band and like a lot of their material, I simply like Clapton better. And what about expectations? I expect guitar and what do I get? Marcy Levy singing gospel and Robbie Robertson taking over most of the lead work? CRAP! Probably the only track that comes close to a real Clapton number is the traditional blues 'Double Trouble'. It's guitarry, dark, bluesy and nice, a typical classy Clapton blues number, but jammed in between all these country/gospel excourses, it sounds pathetically out of place. And besides, it's still inferior to the live recording found on Just One Night.\n\nOkay, once you've finally assumed the idea that it's not really a Clapton album, some other songs prove valid as well. A real highlight on here is Dylan's 'Sign Language', a humble, emotional folkish ditty where Dylan himself joins Eric in a fascinating vocal duet. As far as I understand, this initiates a short series of Dylan songs that he donated specially to Eric, so Dylan fans take heed: Clapton's not exactly the greatest performer of Dylan songs ('Knockin' On Heaven's Door'? No, it was a good version, but why the hell did Eric's reggaeified take on it completely usher out the far superior original out of people's minds? And don't you get me started on 'All Along The Watchtower'... oh, that was Hendrix's, sorry. Big deal anyway), but in those cases when the exact Dylan song exists exclusively in a Clapton version, it's mostly excellent, and 'Sign Language' is just it. Another relative highlight is the Band's 'All Our Past Times', in parts sung by the Band themselves; a live version of it can be found on Just One Night, meaning that the song meant enough to Eric so as not to be relinquished right after being recorded. Still, it's hardly on par with the Band's better material. Finally, Eric's own 'Hello Old Friend' is simple, catchy and listenable. Great pedal steel on there, beautiful 'waves' of friendly sound rushing in on you. Mmm. Tasty stuff.\n\nBut the rest of the songs are almost unbearably second-, if not third-rate. Marcy Levy sings lead vocals on the atrociously generic gospel anthem 'Innocent Times', only to prove that she can hardly match Yvonne Elliman's deep, but effortless chanting; poor Marcy simply screams her head off in a fit of hysterics. The silly drunken jam 'Carnival' which I have already mentioned goes nowhere in particular. The opening 'Beautiful Thing' (yet another Band song) is a sloppy, slow, druggy mess that goes straight down the bog. And the final tracks are so bland and insipid I won't even bother naming them. If you're a great Band fan who digs everything they ever put out, or if you ever fell under the charm of Shakespeare's Sister, you might enjoy this album. Me? I hardly qualify.\n\nThe public was definitely not amused either, and Eric fell under a heavy critical barrage this time. Deservingly so. You see, he might have betrayed his guitar hero image two years ago, but at least on those last two albums he demonstrated some decent songwriting capability (particularly in the songwriting department - 'Let It Grow' and 'Better Make It Through Today' are, after all, two of the most charming ballads he ever put out) and, what's more important, he hasn't completely given up on the guitar; rather, he switched it from 'maximalist' to 'minimalist' mood, fiddling around with different tones and sparse arrangements and economic, but complex chord patterns. It was certainly a mistake, but not a crucial one. No Reason To Cry, however, shows us a Clapton who gives up on guitar altogether, completely and absolutely. He was just so happy to be recording with the Band that he didn't give a damn and threw everything away. Result? One of the most generic and wretched albums of his career. Fortunately, he'd come to his senses next year.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nSLOWHAND\n\nYear Of Release: 1977\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 12\n\nA fine effort, one of his best and maybe one of his most independent. Which is a bonus.\n\nBest song: COCAINE\n\nTrack listing: 1) Cocaine; 2) Wonderful Tonight; 3) Lay Down Sally; 4) Next Time You See Her; 5) We're All The Way; 6) The Core; 7) May You Never; 8) Mean Old Frisco; 9) Peaches And Diesel.\n\nAll I know is that this time Eric didn't mess around with gospel or reggae, and he didn't invite no Robbie Robertson to hang around either. Moreover, the guy he DID decide to hang around with was Glyn Johns (the one who produced Who's Next, remember?), and that meant hard work, no partying, and a sense of purpose that somehow was completely lost on the previous occasion. And the purpose was: to record a good, no bullshit rockin' album for the first time in seven years. And, quite marvelously, he succeeded: Slowhand is such a high point that it helped wrench his reputation out of decline and hold it more or less high for at least half a decade, when it finally became obvious that the glorious shadow of this album was no longer hanging over his head. It ain't no great shakes in terms of innovation or originality, of course, but it helped stabilize the Clapton sound and finally gave him a mighty foundation to work on in the future.\n\nAll of the tunes on here are good, and about half of them downright great - it's no wonder that the opening three tracks were all superhits and stage favourites. J. J. Cale's 'Cocaine', though a far cry from his blistering rockers on the Dominos records, is still menacing enough, with a cool ponderous riff; his muffled vocals are a real threat, and the overdubbed symphony of solos is the closest he ever got to replicating his Cream formula. In fact, with a little tweaking of the guitar tones and a Jack Bruce added on bass, this could have easily graced any decent Cream album, no matter how much radio overplay has obliterated the song's initial charm. The super-sweet 'Wonderful Tonight' probably needs no introduction; for me, the song doesn't hold quite so well as for innocent romantics all over the world, but I simply adore the guitar line it's built upon (strange enough, Eric never could, or would, manage to exactly replicate it in concert; that's why the song is one of the few numbers of his that don't work live nearly as well as in the studio version). Yes, it's prime \"adult contemporary\", but give the guy some credit - a less sharper person would treat the song in the same way but omit that cool guitar line and ruin everything. And the fast countryish 'Lay Down Sally' has a fine minimalistic solo that sounds almost like Knopfler (which is no surprise since Clapton and Knopfler borrowed quite a lot from each other). For some strange reason that has always escaped me, though, 'Lay Down Sally' is often used as the ultimate argument to condemn Clapton's 'white boy blues' playing. So what? Admittedly, he doesn't play the song like a black bluesman. He plays it like a white bluesman. And? It's still fast, minimalistic, soothing, and sharp at the same time. Do you have a problem with that, all you Clapton-haters? Not me.\n\nAnyway, all the three songs are radio hits, of course, so you're probably already sick of 'em, unlike the clever me that never listens to the radio. But what about the others? A couple more groovy rockers: the eight-minute 'The Core' has one more superriff, fine guitar and sax battles and well-constructed vocals that sometimes get on your nerves (courtesy of Marcy Levy), but in any case, the 'sung part' is mainly just used as an introduction for the main jam which almost returns us to the good old days of the Dominos for a moment. And the cover of Crudup's 'Mean Old Frisco' is so hilariously moody, it totally obliterates similar efforts like 'Steady Rollin' Man' or 'Willie And The Hand Jive'.\n\nThen there are two more country shuffles, one of which is great ('Next Time You See Her' - terrific catchy chorus and an unimaginably warm guitar tone) and the other one is pleasantly okay ('We're All The Way' - a bit too sappy, but Clapton's acoustic ballads do tend to be sappy). And finally, so as to let me know the album shouldn't deserve the same recognition as Layla, they decided to include one really suckin' soft rock ballad whose presence is rendered totally unnecessary by the superior 'Wonderful Tonight' ('May You Never'). Oh, and did you know Eric made up 'Wonderful Tonight' while waiting for Patti ex-Harrison trying on her dresses? She probably took quite a long time, as the instrumental 'Peaches And Diesel' that closes the album has almost the same melody. The only difference is that it's less sweet, more guitar-based and devoid of sentimental saccharine lyrics. So it's actually better.\n\nA fine, rewarding album. Of course, Eric was inspired at the moment, but I really think the album's secret lies in his temporary taking off the mask he'd been wearing for three years already and following his own true nature. That's why his live albums are usually better than the studio ones - on stage Eric is always Eric, while in the studio he's either Phil Collins or Marcy Levy or Bob Marley or just Greg Phillinganes (yuck). He managed to be Eric for Slowhand. Sure he's not ripping it apart, off, out or in as in the early years, but you gotta remember his last studio album was No Reason To Cry. I mean, it is a big improvement, and probably one of the most listenable albums of 1977. If you're not a punk fan, of course.\n\nOh, and the album title - in case you didn't know that - just refers to Eric's 'classic' nickname, the one he earned even before 'God'. Rather ironic, isn't it? Of course, he's not exactly the main icon upon which all speedy players are measured, but he does know how to play really fast...\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nBACKLESS\n\nYear Of Release: 1978\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nMore of the same, a little weaker, p'raps, but not such a slump as everybody suggests.\n\nBest song: TULSA TIME\n\nTrack listing: 1) Walk Out In The Rain; 2) Watch Out For Lucy; 3) I'll Make Love To You Anytime; 4) Roll It; 5) Tell Me That You Love Me; 6) If I Don't Be There By Morning; 7) Early In The Morning; 8) Promises; 9) Golden Ring; 10) Tulsa Time.\n\nOf course, nobody could expect another Slowhand from Eric; but I honestly feel that this record has undergone the most severe underrating in the entire Clapton catalog, suffering from the 'good album after great album' complex. It's nothing but a collection of rag-taggy blues covers, saloon boogie music and sentimental pop balladeering with a huge country feel to it, but isn't that what Seventies Clapton is all about? And since it is, I might also add that this is one of the better efforts, because this is a very balanced album. First of all, just like Slowhand, it includes no stupid reggae or gospel excourses, so most of the war is fought on familiar territory. Second, the amount of diversity is satisfying (it doesn't sound like all the songs are Band covers). Finally, there's only a tiny-weeny bit of banal sentimentality that was slowly creeping in on Eric. Yes, the album hasn't produced even a single crowd-pleasing hit (whereas Slowhand produced a grand total of three), but what do I care? How many crowd-pleasing hits can one guy with average songwriting talents get in a decade, goddammit? And then again, some might actually like the album better simply because it doesn't have 'Wonderful Tonight' on it.\n\nThere's one serious problem, tho'. Jes' one. Most of the time it feels like the whole band, Eric included, is recording these songs in a steady slumber. Either the production here was muddy, or the band members were totally uninspired, thinking of wages and relaxation while punching drums or picking guitars or snorting their morning doses of coke, or all of it, but there's not even a slight tinge of real non-simulated energy anywhere. This makes the record a perfect candidate for your turntable whenever you feel relaxed and tired but still want to put on something more artistically valuable than Mariah Carey; however, it should be a very unlucky place to, say, get initiated with Eric's career. Even the faster numbers seem dreamy; as for the slower numbers, well, you'd thought there was a hypnotist in the studio!! Eric is probably also responsible for it - the guitarwork seems a bit too sludgy compared to the album's predecessor, without any interesting overdubbing (as on 'Cocaine') or particularly impressive solo runs.\n\nNevertheless, there are little cute mini-gems all over the record. J. J. Cale's 'I'll Make Love To You Anytime' is so moody, sung by Eric in a low growl, that I enjoy it quite a lot: had it been a little energized, it could have easily beaten out 'Cocaine'. The wah-wah tone on the song is great anyway. Did the guy ever do this live? I'd sure be interested in a bootleg... The countryish 'Promises' is a fabulous ballad, one of Eric's best, no doubt, with tasty dobro backing and charming backing vocals by Marcy Levy who manages to insert herself into the last line of the chorus almost surreptitiously. It's a bit in the vein of 'Lay Down Sally', but less evidently bluesy, more of a heartfelt thing than a minimalistic tongue-in-cheek groove (which 'Lay Down Sally' was. You know what a minimalistic tongue-in-cheek groove is, right? Ever heard Yes' Tales Of Topographic Oceans? It's the exact opposite).\n\nComing back to our senses and to the rougher side of Mr Clapton ('rough' as opposed to 'balladeering', of course, as nothing on here is or could be as rough as, say, Motorhead), 'Tulsa Time' is one of Eric's best country rock variations, although it would really only come to proper life onstage, with Chris Stainton's ferocious piano runs nearly outbeating the master himself. And the minor numbers are all pleasant: two average Dylan covers still groove along nicely (and actually, they're far superior to the songs that Mr Zimmerman was recording for himself at the time; what a beautiful case of altruistic intentions), 'Roll It' has an impressive riff and really highlights Marcy's vocals, and 'Golden Ring' is... well... it's okay.\n\nThe funniest thing is that the only song I'm not particularly fond of on the album is 'Early In The Morning', its only generic blues cover. I do hear that Eric is trying to make it work, but it doesn't. His solos are weak, his vocals are almost stuttering, and the band walks along as in a fog. I mean, it was 1978 for Chrissake; we'd heard enough generic Clapton blues numbers, and hey Eric, if you're gonna put a seven-minute long song on an album, you'd better make sure it stands out in some way. If it doesn't, I have no use for it whatsoever. I wonder if they were all on heroin in the studio? Didn't Carl Radle die of a drug overdose in the near future? There are also a couple passable shuffles, like the pedestrian ballad 'Tell Me That You Love Me', but these are so short they're practically inoffensive, so 'Early In The Morning' still remains the weakest link in the chain.\n\nIn general, this album does work. It has its reservations, but it's not half bad. It also does a good job of lulling you to sleep, but it isn't the kind of Yes dentistry that plunges you into nightmares. Rather it is a soft, sweet sleep with a smile on your face and a relief in your heart. The album cover is quite suitable, too: Eric sitting in a dimly-lit room on a sofa and lazily picking his guitar. Yaawn. What a fine album. What were these stupid critics thinking, I wonder?\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nJUST ONE NIGHT\n\nYear Of Release: 1980\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nSometimes it seems Eric is backed by a couple of robots, but it don't matter much. He's alive!!\n\nBest song: BLUES POWER\n\nTrack listing: CD I: 1) Tulsa Time; 2) Early In The Morning; 3) Lay Down Sally; 4) Wonderful Tonight; 5) If I Don't Be There By Morning; 6) Worried Life Blues; 7) All Our Past Times; 8) After Midnight;\n\nCD II: 1) Double Trouble; 2) Setting Me Up; 3) Blues Power; 4) Rambling On My Mind; 5) Cocaine; 6) Further On Up The Road.\n\nE. C. Was Here was a fine live album, but probably too short for most tastes. After all, one thing Eric has certainly inherited from his Cream and Dominos past is that most of the songs should be performed in long versions, and this ain't exactly appropriate for a single LP. To correct that mistake, Just One Night was made a double album, recorded actually over two nights of Eric performances at Budokan, Tokyo, and the number of songs is significantly increased.\n\nHowever, apart from that, there is one major difference that shouldn't be overlooked. By 1979 Eric has finally fired his American band because of its evident stagnation and all kinds of personal problems, and hired an English one instead. All of the players are professional, especially Henry Spinetti on drums and Albert Lee on second lead, but they just seem a bit too professional: the playing is so tight there's very little room for any jamming or improvisation. In other words, Just One Night effectively cancels any hope at real true band interplay. Remember how the Dominos, for instance, used to thrill you with their great integrated sound? That sound was relatively stripped down, of course, with Clapton the only true soloist, but it never seemed self-indulgent because the others were there to actually contribute to the sound and atmosphere as full-fledged partners. Here, way too often it seems like Clapton's backing band is only there, well, to back him and nothing else. Of course, you could argue that Mr Shyness Itself is very keen on handling the right to solo to his colleagues, so that in the end we have a lot of good, but unnecessary solos by Chris Stainton (keyboards, ex-Joe Cocker's Grease Band) and Albert Lee. But it's almost like a toss-off, in fact, this is a really indulgent approach: 'okay guys, I wanna show that we're all partners and you're not just there to be my slaves, so come up to the ramp and let 'em have it'.\n\nThis is my - and everybody else's - main complaint, and it mars the excitement indeed. Ironically, though, Clapton himself is in top form, particularly on some of the extended performances, and therefore, in order to really appreciate the record, one needs to be able to fully concentrate on Eric's work and forget about the others. It isn't always that easy to do, of course, what with such pointless inclusions as a version of Dire Straits' 'Setting Me Up' (Albert Lee's vocal highlight!) and all, but eventually it becomes possible.\n\nThe first LP doesn't exactly live up to the hype, though - over the years, I have come to view it as some kind of warming-up 'introduction' for the far superior second half. The only highlights on there are the trad. blues cover of 'Worried Life Blues', which can do no wrong, and a really ferocious, driving version of 'After Midnight' where Eric finally whips out the wah-wah and tears out a blazing solo. Everything else is good, but unspectacular: the band does the standard Slowhand set ('Lay Down Sally' and 'Wonderful Tonight'), some recent hits from Backless (the opening 'Tulsa Time' with great piano from Chris Stainton, but a very moderate Eric performance; 'Early In The Morning'; 'If I Don't Be There By Morning' with solos by everyone except Eric) and - fancy that! - even a No Reason To Cry ditty ('All Our Past Times'). None of these songs can hope to surpass the studio versions, and, although I think I've already mentioned that earlier, the live 'Wonderful Tonight' has always been a great disappointment to me because the song owes everything to that haunting guitar riff, and for some reason Eric has never been able - or never wanted? - to reproduce the exact same syncopated riff onstage, always drawing it out and making it fatter and slower as if he were offering it to the public, you know, 'here is your favourite melody, guys and girls, I have slowed it down and dissected it for you to view and caress and alleviate your emotional centers'. This has always angered me.\n\nSo I'm just patiently waiting for the second half where all the real fireworks start. Apart from the wretched 'Setting Me Up', these are five lengthy, drawn-out tracks, all of which qualify. 'Rambling On My Mind' gets a mid-section of 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman' and works exceedingly well; 'Cocaine', by now transformed into Clapton's arena-rock showcase, is less subtle but even more powerful than in the studio; and the closing 'Further Up On The Road' is so tight and energetic I could almost take back my former accusations of the band.\n\nEven so, all of that doesn't make the album deserve more than a strong overall ten; what pushes it over the eleven-mark border are the stunning, definitive live versions of 'Double Trouble' and 'Blues Power'. Now this is what all the radio stations should be transmitting over the waves instead of all that recent techno crap Eric got himself into - and who the heck cares if they're both eight minutes long? 'Double Trouble' shows Eric at his 'miminalistic best': probably having taken a few lessons from Mark Knopfler, he transforms the piece into a thrilling, atmospheric dirge playing his heart out in series of quiet snappy licks that one can only truly appreciate in headphones with the volume turned up to the max. The guitar doesn't just 'weep' on there - it almost seems to be agonizing, but it's a quiet, concealed sort of agony which only makes the sensation more creepy... and beautiful in its creepiness.\n\n'Blues Power', on the other hand, shows Eric at his 'maximalistic best'. The version is also far tighter (and faster) than the original, and Spinetti and Stainton hold up the rhythm perfectly, but what really makes the grade is Eric's wah-wah solo that I'd personally have to count as one of his very best, and arguably the best of those 'technical' wah-wah solos (as opposed to 'purely emotional') I've ever heard. He weaves his fast, fluent, finger-flashing patterns around the rhythms of the band in such a way you'd never believe was possible, throwing out riffs, staccatos, arpeggios and [add your favourite guitar term here, I suppose anything will do] like crazy, and it never seems self-indulgent, not for a single moment! Unfortunately, it's only about four or five minutes long... dammit, I would have easily appreciated another ten or fifteen minutes or so. And each time I listen to the song, I keep getting sad realizing that nobody ever really heard that stuff - no sane person would be able to dismiss Eric as a great guitar player after hearing that one...\n\nAll in all, a very uneven live album, but the high points are so tremendously high it's an absolute must for hardcore Eric fans... and a very recommendable buy for Eric novices, too. Although, of course, the problem with Eric is that all of his live albums are worth buying - and you never really know where to start.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nANOTHER TICKET\n\nYear Of Release: 1981\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nA bit more guitar than usual, so I wouldn't say it sucks.\n\nBest song: RITA MAE\n\nTrack listing: 1) Something Special; 2) Black Rose; 3) Blow Wind Blow; 4) Another Ticket; 5) I Can't Stand It; 6) Hold Me Lord; 7) Floating Bridge; 8) Catch Me If You Can; 9) Rita Mae.\n\nNot bad for a standard \"oh-no-solo\" Clapton album. In fact... hey, what's that I'm saying? It is a very good album, a conscious return to the ideals of 461 Ocean Boulevard: lots of neat little country-rock and blues-rock melodies that are all well-written and well-performed, evading both lengthy uncocentrated jams and sappy adult pop. The good news is that while Eric's newly-assembled British band wasn't that much of a consolation in the live environment, its presence in the studio apparently reinvigorated Clapton, and inspired him to take the reins into his own hands and deliver his most serious and independent effort of the Eighties; in fact, he would never again sound so independent and artistically free until thirteen years later, when From The Cradle briefly brought him back into the creative saddle again.\n\nToo bad he didn't have much time to celebrate this return to form: due to a nasty ulcer, he had to cancel the ensuing tour and the record never got much publicity, becoming yet another 'obscure gem' in the man's catalog - who knows, perhaps had the album been appreciated more, Warner Brothers wouldn't have found it necessary to 'prop' the man up with Phil Collins as producer. But history knows no ifs; the only thing we can do nowadays is correct the little historical bluntness by buying this album, and if you like Eric Clapton, you won't regret it.\n\nNot that outside influences are entirely lacking here: Eric always needed a helping hand in the studio to find inspiration, be it Jack Bruce, Duane Allman or (yuck) Marcy Levy; Another Ticket is no exception, having been recorded with ex-Procol Harum leader Gary Brooker, and you could argue that in parts, the record is more Gary than Eric - but I think you'd be wrong. Gary's keyboard work is excellent, but Another Ticket is essentially pure Eric, that vintage E.C. you'd be able to recognize anywhere. Tasty guitar licks, slightly muffled guitar tones, heartfelt vocal intonations, and even a few extended solos in certain spots - although, true to his no-hero image, Eric takes special care not to make his guitar overshadow everything else.\n\nAs usual, we have a bit of blues - Muddy's \"Blow Wind Blow\", in a fast tempo, good guitar and Eric in a top form; and Elmore James' \"Floating Bridge\", performed a bit too slow for me, but Eric always had a passion for super-slow blues, and plus, it's performed in the same minimalistic way that Eric was developing on his last tour. This gives you a great opportunity to sit back and savour every lick - what could be more delicious? Yummy!\n\nBut, as is usual for Eric's studio albums, the blues numbers are ultimately overshadowed by the poppy-boppy substance. The ballads are all (both) good. 'Something Special' is country-pop with a little twist of humour - 'she ain't too pretty, she ain't too tall, in fact she ain't too much of anything at all' and a warm echoey guitar tone that's not exactly generic. The title track is very long, very sentimental and very fake, awash in synthesizer backgrounds that make it as close to adult pop as possible, but it's still salvaged by a couple 'Wonderful Tonight'-stylized riffs (in fact, I have a hypothesis that Clapton's later intro to the live performances of 'WT' was reworked from this tune) and a beautiful, beautiful, gorgeous vocal delivery that Phil Collins with all of his vocal wizardry could never have pulled off. Plus, if you're really pissed off about the poopification of Eric's ensuing career, I suppose you'll just have to take the lyrics like 'why can't it stay like this forever, why does it always have to change?' to heart. Deeply.\n\nExcellent gospel-pop like 'Hold Me Lord', drenched in classic slide guitars, and hook-filled simplistic pop numbers like 'Catch Me If You Can' and 'I Can't Stand It' are also memorable and stand up pretty well against any 'simpler' material Eric had penned before. 'I Can't Stand It' was even a minor hit single, although it didn't exactly help save Eric's reputation in the long run. And even when you feel like he's getting too generic, with the country stomper 'Black Rose', he still saves the day with a cool catchy chorus.\n\nMy personal favourite here, though, is the closing thunderstorm of \"Rita Mae\": it is absolutely incompatible with the rest of the album and rightly so. Incredible, fero"
