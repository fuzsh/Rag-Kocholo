        "text": "There’s a city in Mississippi where the crossroads meet. Not the ill-fated one where Robert Johnson met the devil to gain mastery over his guitar, but one nearly as potent in cultural terms, if not mythical ones.\n\nFrom Meridian, Miss., named because of its convergence of railroad lines from all points, you can reach out and touch Jimmie Rodgers, go west for Muddy Waters, travel south for Bo Diddley, turn north for Elvis Presley, east for David Ruffin, northwest for Sam Cooke.\n\nMississippi can also claim B. B. King, John Lee Hooker, Jerry “The Iceman\" Butler, Delaney Bramlett, the Blackwood Brothers, Mose Allison, Van Dyke Parks, R.L. Burnside, Little Milton Campbell, Tammy Wynette, The Chambers Brothers, Arthur “Big Boy\" Crudup, Willie Dixon, David “Honeyboy\" Edwards, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Bobbie Gentry, Mickey Gilley, Faith Hill, 3 Doors Down, Son House, Howlin’ Wolf, Mississippi John Hurt, Elmore James, Denise LaSalle, Mac McAnally, Charley Patton, Leontyne Price, Charlie Pride, LeAnn Rimes, The Staple Singers, Marty Stuart, Bukka White, Mary Wilson, Ike Turner, Conway Twitty… even Lance Bass and Britney Spears, if you wish. The list could go on for days.\n\nSo there’s country, pop, jazz, gospel R&B, soul, blues and rock 'n’ roll springing up all around. Yet Mississippi, like Alabama, gets smeared with the cultural-backwater brush.\n\n“We have not done a good job of saying to the world: 'Look at what we’ve got,’\" said Penny Kemp, marketing director of Meridian’s grand new downtown arts center.\n\nIn Meridian, building on the past guides the way to a better future. By restoring the former downtown opera house to a high-tech performing arts center, the city is creating a showcase for artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Bo Diddley, Lyle Lovett, John Hiatt, Joe Ely, Guy Clark, Ricky Skaggs, Sandi Patty, Wynton Marsalis, Kathy Mattea and more, along with theater from “Romeo and Juliet\" to Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain.\n\nAll this in a fully restored 19th century Victorian opera house about the size of Tuscaloosa’s Bama Theatre, in a town with about 40,000 fewer people than the Druid City.\n\nThe Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts is opening this fall, with a season including the above artists and much more.\n\nFirst, it helps to have $24.8 million. So start with $12.1 million from The Riley Foundation, created by brothers who sold a family hospital, using the proceeds to bolster the arts and education, with a focus on Meridian and Lauderdale County.\n\nThat $12.1 million was contingent, though, on Mississippi State University running the center, which also includes a 200-seat studio theater and 30,000 square feet for conference facilities.\n\n“We’re not on a campus; we’re in the middle of historic downtown Meridian, 90 miles from the main campus (in Starkville) and a few miles from the satellite campus,\" said Kemp of the MSU Riley Center.\n\nMalcolm Portera, now chancellor of the University of Alabama system, was crucial to the process. As president of MSU from 1998-2001, Portera worked with the Riley brothers and Meridian community leaders to seal the deal. With the Riley Foundation contribution secure, other funding came in from personal, corporate, federal and local donations; very little state money was used.\n\nBuilt in 1889, the adjacent buildings were formerly the Grand Opera House and Marks-Rothenberg Building (a department store). They hadn’t been in use since 1927.\n\n“Generations of people in Meridian had forgotten there was ever an opera house there,\" Kemp said.\n\nEverGreene Studios of New York City set to work digitally recreating more than 30 wall coverings, based on photographs and scraps of the originals. Studio president Jeff Greene said this was an exceptional project.\n\n“A true gem, this theater is a time capsule or treasure trove of sorts, beautifully displaying and documenting decorative experimentation that took place during the Victorian era,\" Greene wrote in an e-mail.\n\n“I fell in love with the Opera House from the moment I saw it. The number and types of wall coverings combined with the elaborate figurative papier-mâché ornamentation is breathtaking.\n\n“Restoring this theater has been a career highlight ….\"\n\nWhile the theater’s original look bloomed to like-new life, technicians assured that the new center wouldn’t become a museum, but a full-capability performing arts venue. So while it will look like glorious, gaudy 1889, the MSU Riley Center will party like 2006.\n\nDitto the conference center, with four floors of 16 meeting rooms for exhibit, banquet, theater and classroom settings. The latest technology was installed, including wireless connectivity and top audio/video equipment.\n\nThere’s also a recording studio space to contribute to a degree program through MSU’s Meridian satellite campus, and Meridian Community College.\n\nPeopling the center\n\nWith the facilities shaping up, it was decided the people running them should be pros in their fields, not academics.\n\nThe executive director slot went to Dennis Sankovich, with 25 years in the concert business working similar-sized venues, from 1,200 to 1,500 capacity.\n\n“He’s used to booking this size space, and has lots of experience working with agents and so on,\" Kemp said.\n\nSankovich sought a diverse lineup to show off the joint.\n\n“It’s so easy when you’re opening a new facility for people to feel left out,\" he said. “If they don’t see something for them, they can think, 'Well, that place is not for me.’\"\n\nWorking all his contacts in the business, he created a stellar display, from bigger stars like Ronstadt, Skaggs and Marsalis, to the Soweto Gospel Choir from South Africa, the Trinity Irish Dance Company and Ailey II, the top African-American dance company, named after founder Alvin Ailey.\n\nIn between, there’ll be comedy from Vicki Lawrence, doing her Mama character, and Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood, stars of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?\"; family shows such as the Kennedy Center’s version of Roald Dahl’s “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"; and a matinee series with the Cab Calloway Orchestra, Frank Ferrante performing his award-winning “An Evening With Groucho\" and more.\n\n“There a few surprises in the season, like Leahy from Canada,\" Sankovich said. “They’re not as well known in the States, but they’re a phenomenal group, eight brothers and sisters from Ontario, including the world’s best fiddle player.\"\n\nLeahy’s music mixes Celtic, folk, rock, pop, country and classical, kind of like the similarly hard to pin down Lovett, who’ll do two nights with fellow singer/songwriter legends Hiatt, Ely and Clark.\n\n“This is a great facility for a show like that; acoustically, it has great warmth,\" Sankovich said.\n\nThe theater is intimate, with no seat farther than 85 feet from the stage, placed on two balconies in addition to the main floor. A distributed sound system, with delayed speakers so none overdrive, is working to keep the hall’s shaped sound.\n\nThe joyful noise will spread beyond the theater walls, Sankovich said.\n\n“What we’re going to be able to do is amplify that there is a lot of excitement, culture and opportunity in this area,\" he said.\n\n“People who bring new jobs, new factories, are going to say, 'My god, I can live in this quaint little town. My staff is going to love it here.’\n\n“I think we’ve got a lot of stories to tell.\"\n\nScheduled to open Sept. 8, the MSU-Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts is operated by Mississippi State University’s Meridian campus. The center is named in recognition of The Riley Foundation, which is committed to furthering the arts and education for all and made the $12.1 million anchor contribution to the project. The Riley Center includes a historical 1,000-seat opera house that is being restored to its original beauty, and a five-story state-of-the-art conference center, formerly the Marks Rothenberg building. The multi-use center will present a variety of performing arts and educational programs for all ages, backgrounds and interests.\n\nAbout the MSU-Riley Center"
