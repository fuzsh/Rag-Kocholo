I remember people saying, 'I just don't know about Cleveland. I'm just not sure they're gonna make it. I'm just not sure they have what it takes.' Well, today, we're telling the whole world that we've got what it takes and we're doing it. We ought to be proud of what we've accomplished today. But we ought to also tell everybody who will listen, 'Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet!\"\n\nMark Duncan\n\nSept. 2, 1995\n\nThe Concert for the Hall of Fame at Cleveland Municipal Stadium was part party, part paean, with generations of rock stars coming to Cleveland to play together, and celebrate the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Bruce Springsteen and Chuck Berry got the night started with a duet of \"Johnny B. Goode.\" By the time the final note sound at 2:10 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 3, 1995, 41 different combinations of artists had taken the Stadium stage, playing 68 songs over the course of six hours and 40 minutes.\n\nThe all-star lineup included Bob Dylan, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, James Brown, Eric Burdon, John Fogerty, Robbie Robertson, Sam Moore, the Kinks, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, the Allman Brothers Band, John Mellencamp, George Clinton, Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, the Pretenders, Iggy Pop, Melissa Etheridge and Jackson Browne. More than 65,000 fans witnessed the concert, which was one of the most elaborate live productions in Cleveland rock history, rivaling the World Series of Rock events at the Stadium in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nDavid Kohl\n\nJan. 23, 1996\n\nDennis Barrie, the celebrated Cincinnati art museum administrator who came to Cleveland in 1993 to become director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, announces he is resigning to pursue \"new ventures\" in the arts. The resignation is effective March 1, 1996. Barrie's departure comes less than five months after the museum's triumphant Labor Day 1995 grand opening. It also follows closely on the heels of the October appointment of former Stouffer Hotels chief William N. Hulett as the museum's new chief executive officer. Barrie rose to national prominence in 1990 when he was tried and acquitted on obscenity charges for bringing a controversial exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs to the Contemporary Arts Center. Barrie and his wife, Kathleen Coakley Barrie, later joined Malrite Co. in Cleveland, and helped conceive the content and design for the popular Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage in Beachwood. They formed their own museum-design consulting company in 2005. They have worked on a number of high-profile projects, including the Grammy museum in Los Angeles and the Mob Museum in Las Vegas.\n\nMark Lennihan\n\nJanuary 1996\n\nIn New York, Rock Hall inducts David Bowie, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Jefferson Airplane, Little Willie John, Pink Floyd, Shirelles and Velvet Underground, nonperformer Tom Donahue and early influence Pete Seeger.\n\nAP\n\nSept. 29, 1996\n\nGenerations of talented American singers and songwriters pay tribute to American folk hero Woody Guthrie last night in a magnificent and heartwarming three-hour concert at Severance Hall. Bruce Springsteen, the Indigo Girls, Arlo Guthrie, Billy Bragg, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Ani DiFranco, Joe Ely, David Pirner and other stars blended their own music with Guthrie's classics, giving the show a crackling air of contemporary relevance. The concert capped a 10-day \"American Music Masters Series\" tribute to Guthrie sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and the Woody Guthrie Archives. The Rock Hall's \"American Music Masters Series\" focuses each fall on a single American musical pioneer whose work has had a dramatic influence on rock 'n' roll and popular culture.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, the American Automobile Association named Cleveland the second most popular summer tourist destination in the nation, behind only Atlanta, host city of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. The AAA Summer Vacation Forecast was based on surveys of auto clubs and AAA travel agency managers and members across the United States. Just a year after its grand opening, the Rock Hall was already being hailed as one of the primary engines driving the rebirth of downtown Cleveland, drawing visitors from around the world and transforming the city into a major summertime tourist destination. The museum celebrated its first birthday in September of 1996, having just attracted its 1 millionth visitor.\n\nAP\n\nOctober 1996\n\nMelissa Etheridge headlines Rock Hall benefit concert at Gund Arena.\n\nAmy Sancetta\n\nMay 6, 1997\n\nThe first Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony held in Cleveland takes place in the Grand Ballroom of the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel. The inductees were a diverse group, representing the broad definition of what has become known as rock 'n' roll: the Bee Gees, the (Young) Rascals, Mitchell, Parliament-Funkadelic, Buffalo Springfield, the Jackson 5 and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. One of the highlights was an onstage reunion of the Jackson 5, who were inducted by Motown labelmate Diana Ross. All five Jackson brothers -- Tito, Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael -- spoke, but didn't sing. The Bee Gees, ridiculed for years for their association with the 1970s disco era, brought the crowd to its feet with a tight, rockin' medley of their greatest hits -- from early cuts such as \"Massachusetts\" and \"Words\" to disco hits such as \"Stayin' Alive\" and \"Jive Talkin'.\" George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic opened the show with a laid-back seven-minute medley of their greatest hits, including \"Give Up the Funk\" and \"Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow.\" The (Young) Rascals kicked off the show-ending jam with a strong medley that included \"Good Lovin,\" \"Groovin,\" and \"How Can I Be Sure.\" James Taylor followed with a solo acoustic version of inductee Joni Mitchell's anthemic \"Woodstock,\" a 1970 hit for Crosby, Stills and Nash. He was followed by CSN, which offered up \"Teach Your Children.\" The set ended at 1 a.m. with rocker Tom Petty and members of Buffalo Springfield joining CSN in \"For What It's Worth.\"\n\nGeorge Nikitin\n\nMay 1997\n\nIn a risky move, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum replaces many of the original displays in its main exhibition area with a mammoth, $750,000 installation called \"I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era - 1965 to 1969.\" The exhibit, timed for the 30th anniversary of the 1967 Summer of Love in San Francisco, examined one of the most contentious periods in contemporary social history: the drug-fueled flowering of the 1960s counterculture and its role in the evolution of rock music and anti-Establishment literature, poetry, art and politics in the United States and Great Britain. The museum celebrated the grand opening of the exhibit with a take-me-back-to-the-1960s party May 10, 1997, on Key Plaza at North Coast Harbor that attracted more than 4,000 revelers - many in period costume. The party included performances by '60s rock icons such as Donovan, Country Joe McDonald and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Author and Acid Test guru Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters revved up the crowd with a little '60s-style clowning, pulling their colorful, psychedelically painted \"Further\" bus onto the plaza. The \"Psychedelic Era\" exhibit was a critical success, but strained the museum's finances because no corporate sponsor could be found to underwrite its cost.\n\nIn other news, William N. Hulett, who helped guide the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum from concept to reality, announced his resignation as the rock hall's chief executive officer effective June 1. Former Cuyahoga County Administrator David T. Abbott is named interim director pending a national search.\n\nFile Photo\n\nSept. 21, 1997\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd, Levon Helm, Alejandro Escovedo, Guy Clark, steve Earle, Ricky Skaggs, Iris Dement, John Prine, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings and E Street Band members Garry Tallent and Max Weinberg perform at Severance Hall as part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's American Music Masters salute to Jimmie Rodgers.

Located on the fifth and sixth floors of the rock hall, the expansive display features more than 100 artifacts covering the singer's personal life and music and movie careers. The items -- many of which have never been publicly displayed -- come primarily from the Presley estate and the collection of his late manager Colonel Tom Parker. The $100,000 installation is the first temporary exhibit to open in the space that originally housed the museum's Hall of Fame chamber, which was moved to larger quarters downstairs in April. The exhibit is a joint venture between the rock hall and Memphis-based Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland as a museum and tourist attraction in Memphis.\n\nMark Duncan\n\nApril 2, 1998\n\nThe museum opens a new hall of fame chamber in a spacious, circular theater on the third floor. Built with a $5 million grant from AT&T, it is a large multimedia exhibit combining audio, video and interactive computer installations with artifact displays. The centerpiece of the exhibit is a mammoth, three-screen video setup designed by the Irish multimedia production company Dreamchaser Productions, best known for creating the high-tech video staging of the Irish rock group U2's \"Zoo TV\" concert tour. The Rock Hall also unveils a new \"Legends of Rock\" exhibit, replacing \"I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era - 1965-69\" as the showcase installation on the main exhibition floor. It is a collection of displays on notable rock artists, including Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Z.Z.

The exhibit is divided into five main areas, spread over nearly 6,000 square feet. It traces the development of hip-hop from its origins in the Bronx, N.Y., in the 1970s to the so-called \"golden era\" of the'80s to the gangsta rap and pop-crossover success of the'90s.

A party to celebrate the opening of the exhibit, which features costumes and fashion accessories from pop music's best-dressed men and women, brought 600 people to the rock hall. They nibbled beef tenderloin sandwiches and sushi, sipped wine and rocked to the music of Cheap Trick, the Neville Brothers and pop-rock rookie Michael Fredo, nephew of \"Rock Style\" sponsor and fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger. \"There isn't one artist who's a mega-star who doesn't have a great sense of style, from Michael Jackson to Madonna,\" said Hilfiger, not too shabby himself in a dark gray suit and pink paisley shirt.
