        "text": "Occasionally, I like to feature a day on the calendar, where in terms of music history there is a lot going on.\n\nNovember 8th seems to be one of those days. As I went through I noticed some significant releases and milestones so I thought I would share a small sampling today. Just enough for you to add to your daily playlist.\n\nIt was on this day in 1969 that the George Harrison song, ‘Something’ entered the U.K. charts. This classic has the distinction of being the first Harrison composed song to be an A-side for the Beatles. Having been covered by up to 200 artists, ‘Something’ is considered to be the second most covered Beatles song next to ‘Yesterday’.\n\nOn this day in 1971, Led Zeppelin released their iconic fourth album. Over 34 months of writing Ted Tocks Covers, I have featured six songs from this album. I may be wrong but, I am pretty sure there is no other album that has received this much attention (‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ has five). Known only as ‘IV’ this Led Zeppelin recording has sold over 37 million copies and is widely considered to be one of the best albums ever recorded. Here is a cross section of Led Zeppelin songs that have been featured through the Ted Tocks years, including the six songs from Led Zeppelin IV.\n\nHappy birthday to the sensational Bonnie Bramlett. Best known for her work with Delaney in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, Bramlett also worked with artists like Eric Clapton, Tina Turner and Rita Coolidge, just to name a few. Her career has been fascinating. Interesting fact: It has been suggested that Bonnie Bramlett was Mick Jaggers’ first choice to sing the phenomenal backing vocal on the Rolling Stones’ classic song ‘Gimme Shelter’. It is alleged that Delaney refused to allow her to sing with the Stones because they were preparing for a tour. The role was ultimately given to the awe-inspiring soul and gospel singer, Merry Clayton, and the rest is history. In an ironic twist, the Delaney and Bonnie tour was postponed due to personnel issues.\n\nHere are a couple of posts that feature Bonnie Bramlett.\n\n‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’\n\n‘Only You Know and I Know’\n\nFor good measure, watch as she steals this scene in the TV series ‘Roseanne’ while playing the role of Roseanne’s friend, ‘Bonnie’. This goes back thirty years to 1990.\n\nNow we move on to another great Bonnie.\n\nLadies and gentlemen…Bonnie Raitt. She was born on this day in 1949 and her career as a blues singer, incredible guitarist, songwriter and activist is still extremely relevant. Raitt has been celebrated by the music industry with ten Grammy Awards. The list of songs below features several covers and one of her best known original releases. It has an interesting Canadian connection\n\n‘Can’t Find My Way Home’\n\n‘Pride and Joy’\n\n‘The End of the Innocence’\n\n‘Can’t Find My Way Home’\n\n‘Burning Down the House’\n\n‘Angel from Montgomery’\n\n‘Something to Talk About’\n\nOne of Bonnie Raitt’s greatest contributions to music is through her philanthropy. Just one example is the amazing work she has done through what is known as the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund. Raitt was instrumental in funding the replacement of the headstone for one of her primary influences; Mississippi Fred McDowell (‘You Gotta Move’) through this fundraising effort. Since that original outreach, she went on to finance memorials for Memphis Minnie (‘When the Levee Breaks’), Sam Catman and Tommy Johnson (‘On the Road Again’).\n\nBonnie Raitt has never forgotten her roots.\n\nJust a small sampling of stories and songs for you to choose from before you enjoy this beautiful fall Sunday.\n\nHave a great day.\n\nHappy New Year! Welcome to 2019! I thought the best way to ring in the new year would be to start it off with a timeless classic. ‘Dancing Queen’ by ABBA was released as a single in the summer of 1976 and it is as fresh and relevant today as it was over forty years ago. I was somewhat surprised to learn that ‘Dancing Queen’ was the only ABBA song to hit #1 in the United States. It is recognized world-wide and it is virtually guaranteed to put a smile on the listener’s face and literally get people dancing.\n\nWhen Dancing Queen was written it was a response to the emerging disco scene that was beginning to dominate the U.S. charts. Songwriters, Benny Andersson, Bjorn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson aimed to replicate the Phil Spector Wall of Sound with their arrangements. The result became a very seductive series of verses with a powerful and extremely catchy chorus delivered by the enchanting duo of Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. The combination of what I just described and the pure innocence of the main character(s) described in the song, enhances the accessibility of this timeless piece. It is literally about someone who loves to dance and embraces the club scene as her chance to escape the rigors of day to day life. As mentioned it has a universal appeal, which is attested to by the fact that it has over 300 million page views on Youtube alone.\n\nAs Benny Andersson was creating ‘Dancing Queen’ it touched an emotional nerve with both Anni-Frid and Agnetha. According to the former;\n\nI found the song so beautiful. It’s one of those songs that goes straight to your heart.”\n\nAnni-Frid Lyngstad\n\nFaltskog follows with this recollection;\n\nIt’s often difficult to know what will be a hit. The exception was ‘Dancing Queen’. We all knew it was going to be massive.”\n\nAgnetha Faltskog\n\nAdmittedly, I knew very little about the background to ‘Dancing Queen’ when I chose it for today’s feature. While researching it I discovered old names from Ted Tocks Covers had a certain level of influence. The songwriters have suggested that the drum beat of New Orleans master, Dr. John’s 1972 album, ‘Dr. John’s Gumbo’ provided some inspiration for the groove and the opening melody has been noted as a tip of the hat to ‘Sing My Way Home’ by Delaney and Bonnie. Here is ‘Sing My Way Home’ for your reference. Listen to the melody and you hear a slowed down similarity for sure. I found this absolutely fascinating. It is yet another example of how music from a wide degree of styles and genres literally have a very narrow degree of separation when it comes to the creative process.\n\nWhat ‘Dancing Queen’ did for ABBA was solidify them as a massive worldwide act that still resonates today. On dance floors everywhere ‘Dancing Queen’ is guaranteed to fill the floor with people of all ages. It is so catchy, and it brings about a feeling of optimism and excitement. What a nice way to start the year. We could all use a little injection of positivity as we begin a new calendar. Next to the Beatles and Michael Jackson, it is difficult to think of an act that has as much of a universal appeal as ABBA.\n\nPart of what brought my attention to ‘Dancing Queen’ in time for today’s post was Cher being the recent recipient of a Lifetime Achievement recognition by The Kennedy Centre. Cher performs a version of ‘Dancing Queen’ in Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again. She literally turns back time as she plays the role of Meryl Streep’s mother. For the record, Cher is 72 years old and Meryl Streep is 69. It sounds funny, but I am sure, somehow the two iconic actors make it work. Here is Cher doing ‘Dancing Queen’.\n\n‘Dancing Queen’ was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015. A very justified honour.\n\nAll the best in 2019. Dance like nobody’s watching. I say all this, and I am quite possibly the world’s worst dancer.\n\nToday’s post is less about my discussion and more about how a song can evolve through the years. This is part of what intrigues me about the songwriting process and the reason why I began writing Ted Tocks.\n\n‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’ seems to be traced to a song called ‘Lonesome Road Blues’ back in 1924. This version was written by Henry Whitter.\n\nThrough the years ‘Lonesome Road Blues’ and its twin version ‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’ have become standards in the bluegrass, folk, blues and jam band genres. In short, the song cuts a wide berth and nearly one hundred years later it brings an audience to its feet when performed live.\n\nMy introductory post is a version by the legendary Woody Guthrie. His version had a strong connection to the folk scene and as a voice of the people in his day it had a real affinity to the struggles of Americans who lived during the Great Depression and wartime.\n\nThis song came into the Ted Tocks radar because one of the many great versions that exists is by Bonnie and Delaney. Unfortunately Delaney Bramlett died on this day in 2008 after complications from gall bladder surgery. Bramlett had a distinguished career which saw him perform with many of the legends of his time including Eric Clapton, George Harrison, JJ Cale, Janis Joplin and the Everly Brothers. Here is their version of the song with Boz Scaggs and Duane Allman in a soulful rendition that borders on a religious experience.\n\nI became aware of ‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’ in the mid ‘80s thanks to my friend Steve who is a music encyclopedia. He played me a handful of versions by the Grateful Dead and I could feel the excitement as the song built over the course of their jam. Nothing prepared me for actually witnessing them play it live though. The one and only time I saw the Dead play this song was July 4, 1986 at Rich Stadium in Buffalo (Orchard Park) New York. It was a very humid and overcast day, but the Dead were literally on fire. A portion of the show had been simulcast live for the second annual Farm Aid and the band had brought their best energy and musicianship for that audience and the 4th of July festivities. Late in the second set Brent Mydland performed a sizzling version of ‘Gimme Some Lovin’ that had the 80,000 Deadheads in a state of euphoria but they managed to turn it up a notch when they followed with today’s classic song. I reflect back in awe as I picture the massive crowd bopping up and down in unison. Rich Stadium was like a giant popcorn popper and every human was ready to explode. What a scene! The song and the moment were powerful enough but as the song was finishing the clouds opened up and it began to rain. It was like the Dead performed a rain dance and fulfilled their mission. The rain was so welcome as it provided relief from the heat and by the time their set closed with ‘Turn on Your Love Light’ the sun burst through the clouds. It all sounds like hyperbole thirty two years later but people all around were shaking their heads in amazement and proclaiming “the Dead made it rain.” That’s the story we are going with anyway. One of many concert highlights in my life from the many shows I have attended.\n\nHere is the Grateful Dead performing ‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’ from Alpine Valley, Wisconsin. It is not as good as the Buffalo version in my opinion but unfortunately no live video seems to exist from that day. The simulcast to Live Aid ended after ‘Gimme Some Lovin’. The bonus of this version is you get a very animated Jerry Garcia enjoying his incredible interplay with Brent Mydland.\n\nIf you find this lineage of a song interesting go to Youtube and check out the many versions of ‘Lonesome Road Blues’ and ‘Goin’ Down the Road Feelin’ Bad’. It is a fascinating song and an interesting trip through music history."
