        "text": "[Note: New Music Musings, my weekly look at newly released music, will resume next Saturday]\n\nWho would have thought we’d ever see a Rolling Stones tour sponsored by AARP? I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way – after all, I’m a member of the club, and it’s safe to assume so are most other Stones fans in the U.S. For non-American readers who may not be familiar with it, AARP (formerly known as American Association of Retired Persons) is a non-profit, non-partisan interest group focused on issues affecting people age 50 and above. Mick Jagger (80), Keith Richards (80) and Ronnie Wood (76) certainly have reached a stage in their lives by which I hope I’ll be long retired, but that doesn’t mean they’ve forgotten how to rock. The Stones’ remarkable ongoing ability to deliver a great rock & roll show was on full display on Thursday evening (May 23) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.\n\nLike the recent Neil Young & Crazy Horse gig I attended, my decision to see the “greatest rock & roll band in the world” was driven by nostalgia and, yes, the thought this could be the last time – no pun intended! Yet another similarity was an uncertain weather forecast that until the night before included a high chance of late afternoon/evening scattered thunderstorms with possible hail and strong wind gusts. In the end, time was on my side and other attending folks, and the weather gods were kind. I guess unstable weather conditions during what used to be fairly safe seasons of the year have caught up with open air shows – something that going forward I’ll have to factor in when deciding whether or not to purchase concert tickets for certain venues!\n\nIt’s hard to believe Thursday evening’s show happened nearly five years after my previous Stones concert in August 2019 at the same venue. I had seen them first in October 2005 at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pa. In addition to Jagger (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica, percussion), Richards (guitars, backing and lead vocals) and Wood (guitars), the Stones’ line-up included Chuck Leavell (keyboards, backing vocals), Matt Clifford (keyboards, percussion, French horn), Tim Ries (saxophone, keyboards), Karl Denson (saxophone), Darryl Jones (bass) and Steve Jordan (drums), as well as Chanel Haynes (backing vocals). I don’t quite understand why Leavell and Jones haven’t become official members, given their long tenures of 41 and 31 years, respectively!\n\nWhile the Stones have called it the Hackney Diamonds Tour in a nod to their most recent studio album from October 2023 I reviewed here, it was really more of a greatest hits set, mixed with three songs from Hackney Diamonds and a couple of deeper cuts. But this didn’t make me angry – in fact, I loved the variety, and it was evident the audience shared my sentiments! The setlist mostly drew from Stones albums released between the mid-’60s and the late ’70s, such as Aftermath, Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main St. and Some Girls. The only exception apart from Hackney Diamonds was Tattoo You (1981). There were also a couple of non-album singles.\n\nBefore getting to some Stones music, I’d like to acknowledge talented opening act Jon Batiste, a New Orleans pianist and vocalist who blends jazz, soul, pop, gospel, and R&B. He has recorded and performed with the likes of Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, Ed Sheeran and Lana Del Rey, and together with his band Stay Human could be seen each night as bandleader and musical director on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert from 2015 to 2022. Some of Batiste’s best-known songs and renditions include Freedom (2021), It’s Alright (2022) and I Need You (2021).\n\nAfter Batiste’s outgoing and groovy 45-minute opening set and a short break it was time for The Rolling Stones. Appropriately, they charged out of the gate with Start Me Up. Credited to Jagger-Richards as usual, the lead single from their August 1981 album Tattoo You has become a staple of their live shows. Seeing one of my all-time favorite bands again made a grown man cry – okay, not literally, but I can’t deny it was an emotional moment!\n\nIt’s Only Rock & Roll (But I Like It) perhaps best embodies why I’ve loved the Stones for 40-plus years. The classic title track of their October 1974 studio album once again is credited to Jagger-Richards, though then-new guitarist Ronnie Wood contributed to it. Notably, the song’s basic rhythm track came out of a jam session with Wood and his Faces bandmate drummer Kenney Jones, along with Jagger, David Bowie and bassist Willie Weeks. Richards subsequently added some guitar overdubs.\n\nAnd then it was time for the man with the pirate laughter to sing a couple of songs on lead vocals, as has been custom at Rolling Stones shows. Vocally, Keith Richards ain’t no Mick Jagger, but I’ve always dug his somewhat unpolished voice. Here’s I Got the Silver, the first of two songs Thursday evening, which Richards performed on lead vocals. The country blues is off the November 1969 Let It Bleed album – the first song at the time featuring Richards on lead vocals throughout. Also, check Woods on acoustic slide guitar!\n\nThere were so many great songs the Stones played Thursday evening, which made it hard to pick what to capture. Before getting to Gimme Shelter, I’d like to acknowledge their great rendition of Miss You, a song that generally isn’t among my favorites. Among others, the extended version featured neat solo action by Jagger, Daryl Jones and Karl Denson on harmonica, bass and saxophone, respectively. Gimme Shelter, another track from Let It Bleed, was one of the songs during which Chanel Haynes got to showcase her incredible vocal pipes – driving the audience gaga without the artist of the same name!\n\nAfter about 1.5 hours, the Stones closed their official set with another goodie and long-time favorite: Jumpin’ Jack Flash, a non-album single the Stones released in May 1968. At the time, Rolling Stone magazine characterized the classic as “supernatural Delta blues by way of Swinging London.” Some folks regarded it as a return of the Stones to blues-oriented rock following their excursions into baroque pop and psychedelia, which for the record I generally dig.\n\nThen Mick Jagger thanked the audience, wished New Jersey a good night, and walked off the stage, together with his bandmates. But the lights didn’t come on, a sure sign an encore was to come. And it did. Here’s the first, Sweet Sounds of Heaven. I think the ballad is a highlight from the Hackney Diamonds album. Once again, Chanel Haynes shined! Of course, the audience still wasn’t quite satisfied. Can you guess what the second and final encore was? 🙂\n\nIt’s stunning to realize the first Rolling Stones tour of the U.S. happened 60 years ago. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were 20 at the time. Ronnie Wood who must have been a 16 or 17-year-old teenager just started his career, playing lead guitar in British R&B group The Birds – not to be confused with U.S. band The Byrds. After stints with the Jeff Beck Group and Faces, Wood began recording and touring with The Rolling Stones in 1975 before becoming an official member in April 1976.\n\nObviously, time hasn’t stood still, but Jagger, Richards and Wood were still bringing it. I thought Richards had a better night than 5 years ago at the same venue. Woods was in great shape as well, easily matching his performance from August 2019. Jagger continued to display his age-defying energy, working that stage like he was a 20-year-old! I must also commend the other musicians who were a hell of a backing band. Last but not least, I’d like to call out one last time Chanel Haynes who became an official member of the touring band last year – a terrific addition!\n\nHere’s the song line-up from Thursday evening:\n\nSetlist:\n\n• Start Me Up\n\n• Get Off of My Cloud\n\n• Shattered (tour debut)\n\n• Angry\n\n• It’s Only Rock ‘n’ Roll (but I Like It)\n\n• Wild Horses (fan-voted song)\n\n• Mess It Up\n\n• Tumbling Dice\n\n• You Can’t Always Get What You Want\n\n• You Got the Silver (Keith Richards on lead vocals)\n\n• Little T&A (Keith Richards on lead vocals)\n\n• Sympathy for the Devil\n\n• Honky Tonk Women\n\n• Miss You\n\n• Gimme Shelter\n\n• Paint It Black\n\n• Jumpin’ Jack Flash\n\nEncore:\n\n• Sweet Sounds of Heaven\n\n• (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction\n\nAfter playing another gig at MetLife Stadium tomorrow night, the 16-city Hackney Diamonds Tour next travels to Orlando, Fla. (June 3); Atlanta, Ga. (June 7); Philadelphia, Pa. (June 11) and Cleveland, Ohio (June 15). The tour is set to conclude on July 17 in Santa Clara, Calif. The full schedule is here.\n\nLast but not least, I’m leaving you with a Spotify playlist that mirrors Thursday night’s show.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Rolling Stones website; Setlist.fm; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAs we start a new week, it’s time for another post of my irregular music history feature, the blog’s longest running series I started back in July 2016. It was my seventh post, and today is the 76th installment – yes, I had to count them all. Since the feature revolves around specific dates, this still leaves me with plenty of additional posts. With that said, let’s take a look at select happenings in the world of music on May 13.\n\n1955: A performance by Elvis Presley in Jacksonville, Fla. led to what became known as the “first Presley riot.” During the show, Elvis told the screaming girls in the audience he’d “see them backstage after the show.” Apparently, some fans took the tease a bit too literal and rushed toward the stage when the spectacle was over. Some also corned Elvis in his dressing room and tore off his clothes, hoping to grab a souvenir. Remarkably, this all happened before he had ever appeared on national TV. Also in attendance was a man who called himself Colonel Tom Parker and would become Presley’s manager after he had witnessed his potential. Here’s an interview of Presley conducted on May 13, 1995 by Mae Boren Axton, which briefly references the “riot.” It was the first time Axton met Presley, and she ended up giving him her song Heartbreak Hotel. It worked out nicely for both of them, becoming Presley’s first no.1 in the U.S. on the national pop charts\n\n1966: The Rolling Stones released their single Paint It Black in the UK. It had first appeared in the U.S. on May 7. Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the initial version was a much slower, conventional soul song. When during the recording session Bill Wyman started following around on an organ with a spoof of music played at Jewish weddings, Charlie Watts joined in, improvising the double-time drum pattern, echoing the rhythm heard in some Middle Eastern dances. Another notable feature of Paint It Black is the sitar played by Brian Jones, an instrument The Beatles had introduced to pop the year before on their song Norwegian Wood.\n\n1970: Let It Be, Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s documentary about The Beatles and the making of their studio album of the same name, made its theatrical debut in New York City. The UK premiere followed a week later in London and Liverpool simultaneously. At the time, the film wasn’t particularly well received. In addition to poor technical and conceptual qualities, most of the criticism focused particularly on it as a document highlighting the fractured relationships within the band. Peter Jackson’s documentary TV series The Beatles: Get Back, which premiered in November 2021, helped update the record. It drew largely from unused footage and audio material originally captured for and recycled original footage from Hogg’s documentary. An updated version of that documentary, which was fully restored by Jackson, started streaming on Disney+ on May 8. “Let It Be is the climax of Get Back, while Get Back provides a vital missing context for Let It Be,” Jackson told Rolling Stone.\n\n1978: Hawaiian vocalist, songwriter and actress Yvonne Elliman, who had gained initial prominence as part of the cast of Broadway musical production Jesus Chris Superstar, hit no. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 with If I Can’t Have You. Co-written by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees, the catchy dance song was part of Saturday Night Fever, the soundtrack from the 1977 film of the same name, starring 23-year-old John Travolta. At that time, the Bee Gees dominated the U.S. pop charts. If I Can’t Have You knocked off Night Fever, another Bee Gees song from soundtrack, from the top spot, which had been at no. 1 for eight weeks.\n\n1985: The Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) held their first meeting at a church in Washington, D.C. Co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of Senator and later Vice President Al Gore; Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker; Pam Howar, wife of Washington realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former Washington City Council Chairman John Nevius, the PMRC’s goal was to increase parental control over the access of children to music deemed to have violent, drug-related or sexual themes. Their influence led to a Senate hearing on September 19, during which John Denver, Frank Zappa and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister testified, opposing any kind of labeling, arguing any such regulation could lead to censorship. Two months later, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents most record companies, agreed to voluntarily place warning stickers on albums deemed offensive to avoid legislation.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts Music History Calendar; Florida History Network; Rolling Stone; YouTube\n\nHappy Friday and welcome to the second installment of Chris & Max pick. Essentially, this is picking up a song series fellow blogger Max from PowerPop initially started in June 2023 with the year 1955 and ended last month with 1995. The idea of this continuation is to close the gap between 1995 and 2024.\n\nLast week, we looked at 1996. This time, the year is 1997. I realize this post is coming earlier than anticipated. Given my other recurring features, I’m a bit reluctant to commit to yet another weekly post. That’s why I still believe an every-other-week schedule is more sustainable, but I guess we’ll see how it goes!\n\nBig Head Todd and the Monsters/Resignation Superman\n\nKicking off the picks for 1997 are Big Head Todd and the Monsters, a Colorado rock band formed in 1986, who I only “discovered” earlier this year. Resignation Superman, penned by the group’s co-founder, main lyricist, singer and guitarist Todd Park Mohr, is from their fifth studio album Beautiful World, which appeared in February 1997.\n\nRadiohead/Paranoid Android\n\nIn May 1997, British alternative rock band Radiohead released their third studio album OK Computer. I still find it hard to believe I essentially missed it at the time it came out. Paranoid Android, which like all other tracks on the album was credited to the entire group, became the lead single and one of their biggest hits. Founded in 1985, Radiohead still have their original line-up: Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, ondes Martenot, orchestral arrangements), Ed O’Brien (guitar, effects, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion).\n\nSarah McLachlan/Angel\n\nNext up is one of the most stunning pop ballads I know: Angel by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. The inspiration for the song came from press accounts McLachlan had read about musicians getting into heroin to escape the pressures of the cutthroat music business. The intense ballad was the fourth single off her fourth studio album Surfacing, which came out in July 1997.\n\nOasis/All Around the World\n\nMoving on to another British group who were pretty popular at the time: Manchester Brit pop rockers Oasis became an instant sensation in the UK when their August 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe topped the charts there. By the time their third album Be Here Now dropped in August 1997, their enormous popularity had spread to many other countries. Here’s the catchy All Around the World, which also became the third single. Like all other tracks on the album, it was written by Noel Gallagher.\n\nThe Verve/Bittersweet Symphony\n\nHere’s yet another British group who hit it really big in 1997: The Verve and Bittersweet Symphony, Max’s pick. Their biggest international hit single, written by frontman and lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, also helped propel September 1997’s Urban Hymns to become their best-selling album. But all that success was bittersweet. After a lawsuit found The Verve illegally had taken a sample from a 1965 version of The Rolling Stones’ The Last Time by The Andrew Oldham Orchestra, all royalties were relinquished, and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits. In 2019, following the death of Allen Klein, the Stones’ manager at the time of the litigation, Jagger and Richards ceded the rights to Ashcroft.\n\nBob Dylan/Not Dark Yet\n\nWrapping up this post is a great song by Bob Dylan from Time Out of Mind. Many fans and critics regard the maestro’s 30th studio album, released in September 1997, as an artistic comeback. It also marked Dylan’s first with original material in seven years since September 1990’s Under the Red Sky. Here’s Not Dark Yet, a gem as far as I’m concerned!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Acclaimed Music; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWelcome to the second installment of my new recurring feature on prominent music producers and sound engineers. The inaugural post about George Martin is here. Of course, I had to kick off the series in early January with a personality closely associated with The Beatles. A second close to my favorite band of all time are The Rolling Stones, which brings me to my pick for this post: Jimmy Miller.\n\nI suspect this “everyday man-sounding” name may be less familiar than George Martin. But it’s also safe to assume that most folks have heard of Stones gems like Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main St. Or how about The Second Album (The Spencer Davis Group), Mr. Fantasy (Traffic) and Overkill (Motörhead) to name a few other albums that were produced or co-produced by Miller?\n\nThe American record producer and musician, who was born James Miller on March 23, 1942, started getting into music as an 8-year-old, picking up the drums and beginning to write music. I suspect his surroundings played a role. His dad Bill Miller served as entertainment director for several large Las Vegas casinos from the ’50s to the ’70s, booking top acts like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and, yes, Elvis Presley.\n\nMiller’s intro to the music business happened under record executive Stanley Borden who introduced him to Jamaican-British record producer and Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. Blackwell brought Miller to the UK where his first job was to remix Gimme Some Lovin’, a single by The Spencer Davis Group, who Blackwell had signed to Island in 1964. Miller’s remix not only broke the band in the U.S. with their first top 10 hit but also started his relationship with Steve Winwood.\n\nMiller’s production of albums by Traffic and Blind Faith was followed by the first two Spooky Tooth records, as well as the March 1970 Delaney & Bonnie live album On Tour with Eric Clapton, which he co-produced with Delaney Bramlett. And let’s not forget the Stones who first came into the picture in the spring of 1968 with the aforementioned Beggars Banquet, the first of five Stones albums Miller produced in a row.\n\nIn the late 70s, Miller collaborated with Motörhead and produced their albums Overkill (March 1979) and Bomber (October 1979). He continued to work as a producer in the ’80s and early ’90s until his untimely death from liver failure in October 1994 at age 52. Let’s take a closer look at some of Miller’s work.\n\nThe Spencer Davis Group/Gimme Some Lovin’ (1966)\n\nGimme Some Lovin’, written by Winwood and released in October 1966, became the U.S. breakthrough single for The Spencer Davis Group, climbing to no. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Songfacts notes Gimme Some Lovin’ was written with the goal to make it appealing for the U.S. market. Miller added percussion and a female chorus.\n\nThe Rolling Stones/You Can’t Always Get What You Want (1969)\n\nNot only did Jimmy Miller produce for The Rolling Stones, but in some cases he also contributed as a musician. One example is You Can’t Always Get What You Want, which features Miller on drums. Songfacts explains the line, I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy/And man, did he look pretty ill, may be a reference to Miller, adding it might refer to Jimmy Hutmaker, a local character who wandered the business district in Excelsior, Minnesota. Songfacts also notes Charlie Watts did not play on this track for the simple reason he was technically unable to figure out the beat for this unusual groove and rhythm. Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the closer of the Let It Bleed album also appeared separately as a B-side to non-album single Honky Tonk Women.\n\nBlind Faith/Can’t Find My Way Home (1969)\n\nCan’t Find My Way Home is a gem written by Steve Winwood, off the sole self-titled studio album by Blind Faith. In addition to Winwood (vocals, keyboards, guitar), the short-lived English super-group featured Eric Clapton (guitar), Ric Grech (bass) and Ginger Baker (drums). In contrast to Cream and Clapton’s electric guitar god status – something he wanted to get away from – he played acoustic guitar on this track.\n\nDelaney & Bonnie/Where’s a Will There’s a Way (1970)\n\nWhere There’s A Will There’s A Way as a great soulful song co-written by Bonnie Bramlett, Delaney Bramlett and Bobby Whitlock. It appears on the aforementioned Delaney & Bonnie live album On Tour with Eric Clapton, which came out in March 1970 and was co-produced by Miller and Bramlett. Miller also produced Whitlock’s second solo album Raw Velvet released in November 1972.\n\nMotörhead/Stay Clean (1979)\n\nOverkill, Motörhead’s sophomore release from March 1979, was the first of two consecutive albums produced by Miller. One track, Tear Ya Down, lists Neil Richmond as producer. Stay Clean was credited to the group’s three members Ian Fraser Kilmister (Lemmy), Eddie Clarke (“Fast” Eddie Clarke) and Phil Taylor (Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor). Bomber, the second album produced by Miller, came out only seven months after Overkill.\n\nPrimal Scream/Movin’ On Up\n\nThe final song I’d like to call out is Movin’ On Up, one of two tracks produced by Miller for Screamadelica, the third studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream, which appeared in September 1991. It was co-written by the group’s lead vocalist Bobby Gillespie and guitarists Andrew Innes and Robert Young – great song! The album credits also list Miller for mixing.\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above and additional tracks produced or co-produced by Jimmy Miller.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Sunday again, and I’d like to invite you to accompany me on another fun music time travel trip. As always, the itinerary features six stops taking us to music with different flavors from six different decades. Come on and let’s get out of here together!\n\nJohn Coltrane/Blue Train\n\nOur little excursion today starts in January 1958 with jazz saxophone great John Coltrane, who rightfully has been called one of the most influential artists in the history of jazz. He’s credited to have helped pioneer modal jazz and been on the forefront of free jazz. During his 22-year career, Coltrane has played with the likes of Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Red Garland and Paul Chambers, among many others, as you’d expect from a player of Coltrane’s caliber! This brings me to Blue Train, the title cut of his January 1958 studio album. Coltrane (tenor saxophone) was in fine company with Lee Morgan (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone), Kenny Drew (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Philly Joe Jones (drums).\n\nJesse Colin Young/Ridgetop\n\nNext let’s head to September 1973 to visit a true ’70s gem by Jesse Colin Young. The singer-songwriter first gained prominence as a co-founder of American folk rock group The Youngbloods. Among others, Young sang lead on their sole top 40 hit Get Together, a rendition of a song penned by Chet Powers, of psychedelic rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. After the break-up of The Youngbloods in 1972 Young resumed his solo career he had first started in the early ’60s. Ridgetop, written by him, is a fantastic yacht rockish track from his fourth solo album Song For Juli. I love the horn work on this song, giving it a cool jazz vibe.\n\nBig Head Todd and The Monsters/Bittersweet\n\nTime to head to the ’90s with a neat track by Big Head Todd and The Monsters, which is right up my alley and hopefully yours as well. This Colorado rock band was formed in 1986. After two albums in 1989 and 1990, they hit it big in February 1993 with Sister Sweetly, which went Platinum in the U.S. and remained on the Billboard 200 for more than a year, though curiously, it only peaked at no. 117. Off that album, here’s the lead single Bittersweet. Like all other songs on Sister Sweetly, it was solely penned by the band’s vocalist, guitarist and keyboarder Todd Park Mohr. Big Head Todd and The Monsters are active to this day and are currently touring, with Mohr remaining part of the current line-up. They also have a great new single out with a cool John Hiatt vibe.\n\nWillie Nile/This Is Our Time\n\nAre you still with me? Coz this is our time, this is our place, this is our journey to jump to June 2013 and the eighth studio album by New York rock & roll singer-songwriter Willie Nile, American Ride. Nile’s recording career started in 1980 with his eponymous debut album. After his 1981 sophomore release Golden Brown, he was dealing with legal problems that bogged him down for the next few years, but eventually, he was able to resume his career. In addition to his solo work, Nile has performed and recorded with the likes of Ringo Starr, Tori Amos, Elvis Costello and Lucinda Williams. From the aforementioned American Ride, let’s listen to This Is Our Time, written by Nile. Yeah, baby, that’s rock & roll!\n\nAnita Baker/Sweet Love\n\nAfter some blistering rock & roll, let’s take a breather with smooth and soulful vocalist Anita Baker. Sweet Love, a song I’ve always dug, is from Baker’s March 1986 breakout album Rapture, her sophomore release. The album’s first single not only became a top 10 hit on the U.S. pop chart, but also won a Grammy for Best R&B Song at the 1987 Annual Grammy Awards. Sweet Love was co-written by Baker, Louis A. Johnson and Gary Bias. Rapture ended up selling more than 8 million copies worldwide and going 5X Platinum in the U.S. alone (5 million certified sold copies), making it Baker’s biggest commercial success. Man, that’s what I call a great captivating voice!\n\nThe Rolling Stones/Under My Thumb\n\nSo, what’s missing as we once again reach our final destination? Of course, a ’60s tune – simply a decade I cannot miss. Let’s make it count with one of my longtime favorite songs by the greatest rock & roll band in the world, who just keep on going like the Energy Bunny after more than 60 years! Of course, I’m talking about The Rolling Stones. Under My Thumb, co-written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, appeared as a single in April 1966, coinciding with the release of the UK edition of the Aftermath studio album. The song, which features marimba played by the one and only Brian Jones, was also included on the record’s U.S. edition, which came out in July of the same year. Take it way, boys!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. Hope you had as much fun as I did being your conductor. See you ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\n“Any musician with a set of ears was influenced by The Everly Brothers” – Graham Nash\n\nThis post was inspired by a documentary, The Everly Brothers: Harmonies From Heaven, which I coincidentally caught on PBS on New Year’s Eve. From the PBS description: Explore the story of Phil and Don Everly, two of the most important and influential early rock ’n’ roll stars of the 1950s and ’60s. Featuring new interview footage with surviving brother Don and archival interviews with Phil, the film delves into their relationship with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, the songwriting team who wrote many of their early hits. It also includes commentary from Art Garfunkel, Graham Nash, Waddy Wachtel, Keith Richards and other music artists. Here’s a link to the trailer.\n\nI started listening to The Everly Brothers in my early teens back in Germany, after my brother-in-law had given me a compilation as a present. I still own that copy and was able to find it in my current mess of vinyl albums (see photo below). At the time, Elvis Presley still was my favorite rock & rock artist. As such, initially, I was mostly drawn to songs like Wake Up Little Susie, Rip It Up and Keep a Knockin’. I immediately loved the Everlys’ great harmony vocals. I think calling them “harmonies from heaven” is no exaggeration!\n\nIsaac Donald “Don” Everly and his younger brother Phillip “Phil” Everly grew up in a musical family and began singing with their parents Ike Everly and Margaret Everly in the 1940s when they were still children. In the mid-’40s, Ike who was a coalmine worker had a show on Shenandoah, Iowa radio stations KMA and KFNF. First, he performed there with his wife, then with their sons who were billed as “Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil”, who at the time were about 8 and 6 years, respectively. Together, they were known as “The Everly Family”.\n\nIn 1953, the family relocated to Tennessee, first to Knoxville, then to Madison. Following high school graduation in 1955, Don moved to Nashville, together with Phil who finished high school there in 1957. The brothers decided they wanted to continue focusing on making music together. Eventually, they came to the attention of family friend Chet Atkins, manager of RCA Studios in Nashville. Atkins helped the brothers get a deal with Columbia Records, but after their first single Keep a-Lovin’ Me flopped, the label dropped them.\n\nAtkins subsequently introduced Phil and Don to Wesley Rose who told them he could get a record deal if they would sign with his music publishing firm Acuff-Rose. The brothers obliged and Rose introduced them to Archie Bleyer, founder of Cadence Records. Phil and Don got signed and recorded their first single for the label, Bye Bye Love, penned by husband-and-wife country and pop songwriting duo Felice Bryant and Diadorius Boudleaux Bryant.\n\nReleased in March 1957, Bye Bye Love became the first of many major hits for The Everly Brothers. In addition to topping the county charts in the U.S., it climbed to no. 2 and no. 5 on the pop and R&B charts, respectively, indicating the duo’s appeal across different music genres. By 1973, tension had built up between the brothers, and they decided to split to pursue solo careers. While Don found some chart success, Phil did not, even though he recorded more frequently.\n\nIn September 1983, Phil and Don reunited as The Everly Brothers at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert was recorded and released as The Everly Brothers Reunion Concert later that year. While the live album reached a respectable no. 47 in the UK, it stalled at no. 162 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. The Everly Brothers subsequently released three additional studio albums in the ’80s. They continued to tour on and off until 2003-2004 when they were guests on Simon & Garfunkel’s Old Friends reunion tour.\n\nPhil Everly passed away from COPD on January 3, 2014 at the age of 75. Don Everly died at his home in Nashville on August 2021. He was 84. Let’s take a closer look at some of The Everly Brothers’ music and those “harmonies from heaven.” I’m going to highlight six of their songs, followed by a larger career-spanning Spotify playlist.\n\nBye Bye Love (March 1957)\n\nNotably, this classic had been rejected by 30 other artists before it was given to The Everly Brothers. “I wrote ‘Bye Bye Love’ while traveling home one night,” noted Boudleaux Bryant. “Felice was driving down the highway and I got the first verse and chorus right down there. I always make sure I have a pen and paper in the car for these occasions.” He went on, “We really believed in the song and were disappointed when so many people turned it down. They said it was unsuitable, some even asked if we has anything better!”\n\nWake Up Little Susie (September 1957)\n\nWake Up Little Susie, another song by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, became the first no. 1 for the Everlys on the U.S. pop chart. It also topped the country and R&B charts, as well as the charts in Canada. In addition to outstanding harmony vocals, the song has a really cool rhythm, which Don Everly said was inspired by Bo Diddley’s signature beat. “And I guess it rubbed off on me,” Keith Richards said in the above documentary. “Don’s acoustic guitar – rockin’, man!”\n\nAll I Have to Do Is Dream (April 1958)\n\nWritten by Boudleaux Bryant alone for a change, All I Have to Do Is Dream became another major hit for The Everly Brothers, toping the pop, country and R&B charts in the U.S. Once again, it reached no. 1 in Canada and became the duo’s first song to top the charts in the UK as well. “I remember hearing ‘All I Have To Do Is Dream’ on an acetate with Boudleaux’s version on it, and I said, at the time, they could have put Boudleaux’s out and it would have been a hit,” Don Everly stated. “It’s just a great, great song. It’s beautiful.” Indeed! BTW, these neat tremolo-style guitar chords were played by Chet Atkins.\n\nCathy’s Clown (April 1960)\n\nWhile Felice and Boudleaux Bryant wrote many hits for the Everlys, the duo also had original songs. One of the most beautiful examples I know is Cathy’s Clown, which Don Everly wrote. Initially, both brothers had been credited until 1980, seven years after Don and Phil had split and I guess still weren’t on great terms. The song, which has been inspired by one of Don’s ex-girlfriends, became the last no. 1 for The Everly Brothers in the U.S., topping both the pop and the R&B charts. Cathy’s Clown was their first single on Warner Bros. after Cadence Records no longer could afford resigning them. They were still on top of the world.\n\nCrying In the Rain (January 1962)\n\nBy the time Crying in the Rain came out, The Everly Brothers had not had a big hit in nearly a year. It already foreshadowed their declining popularity. The ballad was penned by Brill Building songwriters Howard Greenfield and Carole King, who worked for Don Kirshner’s Aldon Music at the time. Kirshner had been eager to produce a hit for The Everly Brothers. He didn’t need to cry in the rain. The song, one of the few King didn’t write with her usual lyricist Gerry Goffin, became the second-to-last top 10 hit for the Everlys on the U.S. pop chart (no. 6) and also reached that same spot in the UK.\n\nOn the Wings of a Nightingale (August 1984)\n\nFor my final pick, I’m jumping 22 years forward to what became the last charting single for the Everlys, reaching no. 50 and no. 41 on the U.S. and U.K. pop charts, respectively. Following their reunion concert in London the previous year, Phil and Don recorded EB 84, their first studio album of original material in 11 years. On the Wings of a Nightingale, which Paul McCartney specifically had written for them, became the lead single. After Phil Everly’s death in 2014, Macca wrote the following on his website, as reported by the Los Angeles Times: “Phil Everly was one of my great heroes. With his brother Don, they were one of the major influences on the Beatles. When John and I first started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don.”\n\nAltogether, The Everly Brothers scored 35 Billboard Top 100 singles, of which 26 reached the top 40. They hold the record for the most Top 100 singles by any duo, second only to Hall & Oates for the most Top 40 singles by a duo. In the UK, the Everlys had 30 chart singles between 1957 and 1984. In 1986, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Neil Young, who said every musical group he had ever belonged to had tried, and failed, to copy the Everly Brothers’ harmonies. Here’s the above-mentioned Spotify playlist.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; Los Angeles Times; YouTube; Spotify\n\nJust in time before seeing off the year, I’d like to take a final look at new music. This post highlights my six favorite albums of 2023 I reviewed.\n\nHighway 61 – Driving South\n\nAfter 30 Years and an incredible background story including the global pandemic, a near-fatal cancer episode and the death of a music mentor, Los Angeles blues rock four-piece Highway 61 released their debut album Driving South on March 24. While after their formation in the early ’90s the band managed to establish themselves on the Southern California club circuit, the record deal they sought remained elusive, and they broke up in 1993. Fast forward to the summer of 2022 when they reconvened for the first time in decades at an L.A. studio to finally record their first album. Highway 61 blend flavors of The Rolling Stones and Tom Petty with dashes of The Black Crowes and Stevie Ray Vaughan. For a little taste, here’s the kickass opener Walk On Water (full album review). Thanks again to Gregg Bell of Wanted Management, who brought Highway 61 on my radar screen!\n\nIan Hunter – Defiance Part 1\n\nIan Hunter may be an octogenarian, but he sure as heck can show all the young dudes how to rock. After his departure as lead vocalist from British glam rockers Mott the Hoople in 1974, Hunter launched a solo career and has released his own albums at a fairly steady pace. He frequently collaborated with Mick Ronson until the untimely death of David Bowie’s former sideman in 1993 at the age of 46. His 15th and latest album Defiance Part 1, recorded during COVID lockdown and released on April 21, features the late Jeff Beck, Slash, Billy Gibbons, Todd Rundgren and Ringo Starr, among others, who all added contributions at their home studios. The album also includes Hunter’s longtime collaborator Andy York, one of John Mellencamp’s guitarist, who also served as co-producer. Here’s This Is What I’m Here For, written by Hunter and featuring the late Taylor Hawkins (formerly of Foo Fighters) on drums, Waddy Wachtel (guitar) and Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott (backing vocals) (full album review).\n\nLucinda Williams – Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart\n\nLucinda Williams may be among the ultimate rock & roll survivors. Only two and a half years ago, things looked pretty bleak for the singer-songwriter, who turned 70 in January. After her East Nashville home had been damaged by a tornado in March 2020, she suffered a debilitating stroke in November of the same year. Not only did the stroke limit Williams’ physical mobility, but it also took away her ability to play guitar, the instrument she had relied on to write her songs. None of this stopped Williams. After intense rehab, she returned to the stage. Still unable to play guitar, she adjusted her way to write music, collaborated with her husband and co-producer Tom Overby and others, and recorded the incredible album Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart, which dropped on June 30. I don’t mean to romanticize hardship, but I find Williams’ strength truly inspiring. Here’s the de facto title track Rock n Roll Heart, co-written by Williams, Overby and Travis Stephens, guitarist and Williams’ road manager. The song features Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa on backing vocals (full album review). Only select songs of the album are available on streaming services.\n\nCordovas – The Rose of Aces\n\nEast Nashville, Tenn.-based Americana and country rock band Cordovas have become one of my favorite contemporary groups since the summer of 2018 when I coincidentally caught them at a free open air summer concert in New Jersey. Their three-part harmony vocals and warm sound remind me of other groups like The Band, Grateful Dead, Eagles and Little Feat. Cordovas were formed in 2011 by songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Firstman after he had put out a series of solo projects and served as bandleader on NBC’s former late-night TV show Last Call with Carson Daly from 2005 to 2009. On August 11, they released their fourth studio album The Rose of Aces, another gem. Here’s Love Is All It Takes, a song written by Firstman with a neat Allman Brothers Band vibe (full album review).\n\nThe Rolling Stones/Hackney Diamonds\n\nHackney Diamonds is no Sticky Fingers or Exile On Main St., but the first new Rolling Stones album with original music in 18 years still marks a late-stage career highlight. Released on October 20, Hackney Diamonds sounds remarkably fresh and dynamic for a band that has existed for 61 years! The first Stones album since the 2021 death of longtime drummer Charlie Watts features Elton John, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder, Bill Wyman, Paul McCartney and even Watts, among others. One of the most effective contributions are Lady Gaga’s backing vocals on Sweet Sounds of Heaven, a great soulful ballad credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It also includes Wonder on keyboards and piano, but you don’t notice unless you carefully listen to Jagger telling Wonder, ‘Play me something, Steve’, at around the 5:30-minute mark or check the credits – a relatively small wrinkle on what I think is the Stones’ best studio album since 1989’s Steel Wheels (full album review).\n\nRaze Regal & White Denim Inc. – Raze Regal & White Denim Inc.\n\nThe collaboration between Raze Regal, who AllMusic calls an eclectic, psych, jazz, and rock-influenced guitarist, and James Petralli, vocalist of Austin, Texas indie rock band White Denim who he co-founded in 2006, is one of my most intriguing new music discoveries this year. The album’s sophisticated sound blending jazz, rock, soul and pop at times reminds me of Steely Dan and some of Gino Vannelli’s work I’ve heard. Here’s the cool opener Ashley Goudeau, named after a local Austin morning news anchor, a song about a parasocial relationship with a TV personality (full album review).\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday! I’d like to invite you to join me on my latest music time travel excursion. Since many folks like to call it the most wonderful time of the year, I decided to give today’s trip a Christmas theme. Other than that, everything will stay the same, i.e., six tracks from six different decades in different flavors!\n\nIn my original home country Germany, people who celebrate Christmas traditionally start the festivities today, December 24, in the early evening, followed by two days that are part of the Christmas holiday. Here in the U.S., the holiday is observed on December 25 – not everything is bigger in America after all! 🙂\n\nRegardless of whether you celebrate Christmas, I hope to see you on board of the magical music time machine. As always, our itinerary is pretty eclectic. It’s gonna be fun, even if you don’t celebrate Christmas. All aboard, fasten your seatbelts and off we go!\n\nLouis Armstrong/Christmas In New Orleans\n\nOur trip starts in 1955 with an iconic jazz artist who I trust doesn’t need much of an introduction: Louis Armstrong. Over a 50-year-plus career between 1919 and 1971, Satchmo touched various genres from Dixieland to swing to pop. The man with the distinct gravelly voice also helped popularize scat singing, a vocal improvisational style using wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or no words at all, and was an inventive trumpet and cornet player. Christmas In New Orleans, which Armstrong released as a single in 1955, was written by Joe Van Winkle and Richard Sherman. Listening to Satchmo just makes me happy!\n\nAC/DC/Mistress For Christmas\n\nHow about a hard rock Christmas song? I told you this was going to be an eclectic experience! Let’s head to Australia and September 1990, which saw the release of AC/DC’s 12th studio album The Razors Edge. Other than that it was co-written by the band’s Angus Young and Malcolm Young, I couldn’t find any specific information about Mistress For Christmas. Perhaps the song is deemed too naughty. If that’s the case, perhaps looking at it with a sense of humor would help! In the UK, Mistress For Christmas also became the B-side of the single Moneytalks. It’s classic AC/DC, and I love it!\n\nJames Brown/Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’60s with a groovy and soulful Christmas song by James Brown. Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto was penned by Alfred Ellis, Charles Bobbit and Hank Ballard. It appeared on Brown’s second Christmas album A Soulful Christmas, released in November 1968. Christmas was special to Brown. In addition to recording various Christmas albums, he started the James Brown Toy Giveaway in the early ’90s where he dressed up as Santa and handed out presents to needy children during Christmas gatherings. The annual toy giveaways continue to be conducted to this day by the James Brown Family Foundation.\n\nCher/Run Rudolph Run\n\nOur next stop takes us all the way back to the present. Undoubtedly, you’ve heard Run Rudolph Run, a staple during the Christmas holiday season. Initially recorded and released by Chuck Berry in 1958, and credited to him, Marvin Brodie and Johnny Marks, the classic Berry rock & roll-style song has been covered by numerous other artists over the decades, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Foo Fighters, Sheryl Crow, Bryan Adams and Keith Richards. The latest is Cher who included it on her first-ever Christmas album, Christmas, released on October 20 this year. At 77, Cher surely still knows how to rock!\n\nRun-DMC/Christmas in Hollis\n\nDid anyone say there’s no such thing as a Christmas song that raps? In case that myth ever existed, American hip hop and rap group Run-DMC busted it in 1987 with Christmas in Hollis. Co-written by their three members Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell, and co-produced by them and Rick Rubin, the track first appeared on A Very Special Christmas, an October 1987 compilation to benefit the Special Olympics. In November of the same year, it also came out as a single. Unlike Walk This Way, Run-DMC’s hugely successful 1986 collaboration with Aerosmith, Christmas in Hollis missed the charts.\n\nGreg Lake/I Believe in Father Christmas\n\nAnd once again, we’re reaching our sixth and final destination. This will take us to November 1975 and I Believe in Father Christmas, a single by Greg Lake. The English bassist, guitarist, singer and songwriter, who passed away in December 2016 at the age of 69, first gained prominence as a co-founding member of progressive rock bands King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Composed by Lake with lyrics by English poet and songwriter Peter Sinfield, I Believe in Father Christmas also borrows some music from Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev’s 1934 Lieutenant Kijé Suite. While Lake called the song a protest of the commercialization of Christmas, Sinfield said the lyrics are about a loss of innocence and childhood belief. Check out this beautiful sound!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. Hope there’s something for you here. To anyone celebrating it today, Merry Christmas!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\n“We age not by holding on to youth, but by letting ourselves grow and embracing whatever youthful parts remain.”\n\nKeith Richards (as recounted by American Songwriter)\n\nThis Monday, December 18, Keith Richards turned 80. While I certainly don’t feel an obligation to cover birthdays of each music artist I dig, leaving out this one somehow felt wrong. After all, The Rolling Stones have been among my top favorite bands for 40-plus years, and the Stones simply wouldn’t have been the Stones without their riff master who was instrumental in popularizing open G guitar and other tunings!\n\nRichards got into the guitar during his childhood, a noteworthy anecdote. One day, a guitar on a shelf caught the little boy’s interest, but it was too high to reach. It belonged to his maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore “Gus” Dupree, who played in a jazz big band. Richards wanted to grab the guitar, so Dupree told him that if he could somehow reach it, he could have it. Richards proved to be resourceful, took a chair and stapled books and cushions on top of each other until he finally got high enough to grab the instrument.\n\nNot only did Dupree keep his promise, but he also taught Richards the rudiments of Malagueña, his first guitar tune! Richards turned out to be an eager student, practicing the song all the time. When his grandpa noticed the boy’s enthusiasm, he allowed him to keep the guitar for good. While Richards’ father Herbert William Richards, a factory worker, disparaged his son’s musical enthusiasm, little Keef couldn’t be stopped.\n\nFast forward to October 1961, when 17-year-old Richards ran into his former classmate and childhood friend Mick Jagger on a Dartford Railway Station platform. When he noticed Jagger was carrying records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters, it became evident they dug the same music. A musical partnership started shortly thereafter, which less than two years later culminated in the formation of the world’s greatest rock & roll band.\n\nThis shall suffice for general background, given there are countless biographical write-ups on Richards and the Stones. Instead, I’d like to focus on music, specifically six songs in which Richards played a significant role, either as lead vocalist and/or writer, drawing from both the Stones and his solo career. These songs will also be featured in a Spotify playlist at the end of this post, along with 14 others.\n\nJumpin’ Jack Flash (non-album single, May 1968)\n\nCredited to Jagger and Richards, though Bill Wyman claimed he wrote part of it, Jumpin’ Jack Flash not only is among my all-time favorite Stones songs but also features one of Keef’s best riffs. “When you get a riff like ‘Flash,’ you get a great feeling of elation, a wicked glee,” Richards told Rolling Stone, as captured by Songfacts. “I can hear the whole band take off behind me every time I play ‘Flash’ – there’s this extra sort of turbo overdrive. You jump on the riff and it plays you. Levitation is probably the closest analogy to what I feel.”\n\nYou Got the Silver (Let It Bleed, November 1969)\n\nWhile with Something Happened to Me Yesterday Keef had official lead vocal parts as early as on the Stones’ January 1967 album Between the Buttons, the band’s first song to solely feature him in this role was You Got the Silver. Credited to Jagger and Richards, the song from the Let It Bleed album was written by Richards about his then-girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, who used to go out with Brian Jones – a situation that further estranged Jones from the band. He still played autoharp on the recording, one of his final song contributions before the Stones parted ways with him.\n\nBefore They Make Me Run (Some Girls, June 1978)\n\nBefore They Make Me Run, off the Some Girls album, is another Stones song that solely features Richards on lead vocals. He also did most of the work on the track, which was recorded while he was out of jail on bail after he had gotten arrested in Toronto for drug trafficking in 1977. He ended up with probation. “That song, which I sang on that record, was a cry from the heart,” explained Richards in his book Life (2010), as documented by Songfacts. “But it burned up the personnel like no other. I was in the studio, without leaving, for five days… I had an engineer called Dave Jordan and I had another engineer, and one of them would flop under the desk and have a few hours’ kip and I’d put the other one in and keep going. We all had black eyes by the time it was finished.”\n\nStart Me Up (Tattoo You, August 1981)\n\nThis brings me to the final Stones track highlighted in this post. Opening with one of Keef’s trademark riffs, Start Me Up was initially recorded with a reggae beat in 1977 during the sessions for Some Girls. But the Stones didn’t like the result and shelved the track – until it reemerged for Tattoo You. “The story here is the miracle that we ever found that track,” Richards explained, according to Songfacts. “I was convinced – and I think Mick was – that it was definitely a reggae song. And we did it in 38 takes – ‘Start me up. Yeah, man, cool. You know, you know, Jah Rastafari.’ And it didn’t make it. And somewhere in the middle of a break, just to break the tension, Charlie and I hit the rock and roll version. And right after that we went straight back to reggae. And we forgot totally about this one little burst in the middle, until about five years later when somebody sifted all the way through these reggae takes. After doing about 70 takes of ‘Start Me Up’ he found that one in the middle.”\n\nTake It So Hard (Talk Is Cheap, October 1988)\n\nLet’s next turn to Keef’s first solo album Talk Is Cheap. By the mid-’80s, his relationship with Jagger was on the rocks. When the Stones frontman was more interested in pursuing his solo career than touring behind the group’s March 1986 album Dirty Work, Richards teamed up with Steve Jordan (who has been the Stones’ touring drummer since Charlie Watts’ death in 2021) to write songs. Richards also gathered an impressive backing band whose core members in addition to Jordan (drums) included Waddy Wachtel (guitar), Ivan Neville (piano, keyboards, backing vocals) and Charley Drayton (bass). They became known as The X-Pensive Winos. Here’s Take It So Hard, which also appeared as a single.\n\nCrosseyed Heart (Crosseyed Heart, September 2015)\n\nMy final pick is Crosseyed Heart, an homage to one of Richards’ key influences, and the title track of his third and most recent solo album. Like Talk Is Cheap, it featured the X-Pensive Winos. “The ‘Crosseyed Heart’ one came because I wanted to start it off where basically all the music that I know and I’ve played came from,” Richards told Uncut, according to Songfacts. “One of the wellsprings was Robert Johnson, and I’ve always wanted to do something in his style, so ‘Crosseyed Heart’ came from that.”\n\nRichards’ 80th birthday coincided with his 40th wedding anniversary. On December 18, 1983, he married then-27-year-old American model and actress Patti Hansen. They have two daughters, Theodora Dupree, born 1985 and named after Keef’s grandpa; and Alexandra Nicole, born 1986.\n\n“About myself I have no great illusions. I know what I am. I know what I’m good at. I know what I ain’t. I’m always hoping to surprise myself. But I do have a love of music and I do love to communicate it, and that’s the best I can do, really. And I can raise a good family, too.”\n\nKeith Richards (as recounted by American Songwriter)\n\nLast but not least, here’s the aforementioned Spotify playlist.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; American Songwriter; Songfacts; YouTube; Spotify"
