        "text": "IF YOU’VE NEVER HEARD TWINKLE sing, you could be forgiven for making some incorrect assumptions.\n\nYou might think she performs children’s songs.\n\nOr, because she has a ’60s-sounding name — think Moonbeam, Rainbow — you might expect psychedelic music or folk.\n\nBut you’d be wrong.\n\nTwinkle’s no lightweight musically. She’s a belter. A soulful singer who holds nothing back, she can wail with the best of them.\n\nGregg Baker, writing in The New York Times, said she possesses “a voice so hot she can sing the ice off a polar cap.”\n\nThe late record producer Jerry Wexler, who co-founded Atlantic Records and worked closely with Aretha Franklin, saw Twinkle perform and declared her “the greatest soul singer I have heard in a long time, and believe me, I’ve seen my share of imitators.”\n\n“People always compare me to Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin,” Twinkle says.\n\nInitially, she couldn’t understand the Janis comparisons, because their voices are nothing alike. But then she realized it was about “that total abandonment, that emotional sacrifice. Everything, it’s all out right now,” she says. “This is me, everything I’ve got, right now.”\n\nShe recalls when she was in 10th grade performing at a dance. One of her band mates told her, “Twink, you have to pace yourself.” And another responded, “She can’t pace herself. She sacrifices herself to the audience every time.”\n\nThe comment pleased Twinkle.\n\n“That’s the way it is with me,” she says.\n\n‘Grab it and pull it out!’\n\nShe’s like her generation’s Bonnie Bramlett, of the ’60s-’70s duo Delaney and Bonnie, who toured as Delaney and Bonnie and Friends (the friends included Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Duane Allman, Dave Mason and Billy Preston). Ms. Bramlett sang with a gritty soulfulness.\n\n“We don’t sound the same, but we come from the same place when we’re singing,” Twinkle says. “Reach in there, grab it and pull it out! It’s all or nothing.”\n\nWhen Twinkle sang for a benefit for her father, Buddy Yochim, this spring (also a musician, he was fighting cancer at the time; he died in July), Ms. Bramlett came onstage as a surprise guest and sang “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” with her. A long-time family friend, Ms. Bramlett has known Twinkle since she was a little girl.\n\nTwinkle’s style is difficult to pin down. On her website, she lists blues, rock and soul, but she’s also performed Southern rock, jammed to Middle Eastern grooves and rocked out with heavy metal musicians.\n\nA Sarasota native, she’s well known in the area, having performed at clubs and festivals all over Southwest Florida. In Fort Myers, she performed at the now defunct downtown Liquid Café, and opened once for David Crosby and twice for The Bacon Brothers at the now-shuttered Neptune’s on U.S. 41.\n\nOn Saturday, Sept. 24, the singer/ songwriter returns to the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota to celebrate the 20th anniversary of her first album, “Haunted By Real Life.” The evening’s opening act, Ambrosia, is known for the hits “Biggest Part of Me,” “You’re the Only Woman” and “How Much I Feel.”\n\nTwinkle plans to perform all the songs from her album from start to finish, starting with “Can’t Get Love With Money” and ending with “You Are Not Yourself Anymore.”\n\nTwo decades later\n\nShe signed with Warner Brothers in 1990; “Haunted By Real Life,” on Reprise, was produced by Patrick Leonard, who also worked with Madonna, Roger Waters, Pink Floyd, Michael Jackson and Elton John.\n\n“He took me under his wing,” Twinkle says about Mr. Leonard. “He’s a wonderful musician and just an incredible genius person. He did this intricate production.”\n\nTwinkle and her musicians have “all been absorbing it,” she says about revisiting the two-decades-old album. “Every time, you hear something else,” she says. “It’s a layer-upon-layer album.”\n\nRandy Jackson plays bass on the album, as do musicians from the Madonna tour.\n\n“It was her tour where she had those cones for breasts,” Twinkle recalls. “They had to play note-for-note the same every night. But for this album, they just let loose. It seemed like they were all really happy to be there.”\n\nTwinkle, who was in her 20s back then, was thrilled to sign with such a prestigious label. “It’s the golden ring,” she says about signing with a label. Her record deal, she adds, was “the largest deal that Warner ever signed with an unsigned artist.”\n\nThey advertised her on the back cover of Billboard magazine, and she was flown to New York to guest-VJ on VH1’s “Top 21 Count Down.” She performed at the Montreaux Jazz Festival, accompanied by Eric Clapton’s band under the direction of Quincy Jones.\n\nBut the powers at Warner Brothers didn’t like her nickname, Twinkle, and so they promoted her by her given name, Schascle (rhymes with gazelle.)\n\n“They thought Twinkle sounded too teeny-bopper,” she says. (She’s been known as Twinkle ever since her parents brought her home from the hospital as a newborn. “They were showing me off at a party and one guy says, ‘She smiles so much, you have to call her Twinkle.’ And that’s all anybody ever called me.”)\n\nShe signed a deal for six albums, with an option to record two more.\n\nThe new beginning\n\nHer musical history since then is a microcosm of the history of the music industry itself.\n\n“The industry switched to instant gratification,” she says.\n\nThe bean counters took over, and suddenly it was all about quick hits and being the biggest performer. The bottom line counted more than developing artists.\n\n“It happened overnight,” she says, adding it was disappointing, because “artist development is what made Warner great in the first place.\n\n“I was so young. I wanted to sing and write.”\n\nReleased from her record contract in the late 1990s, she raised her two daughters, Ursula and Monique, while continuing to perform and record. She recorded 16 albums, most of them independent, such as “Live at the 5 0,” “Gemini” and “LA Sessions.” She also made one record on the EMI label (they changed her name to Twinkle Shazelle).\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Twinkle toured with Dickey Betts and the Great Southern\n\nBand. In 2008 she opened for Aerosmith at the St. Pete Times Forum. She’s done everything from singing “God Bless America” before a crowd of 75,000 at a Miami Dolphins game in Tampa to performing “Little Wing” with Paul Rodgers and Bad Company in Tacoma, Wash. She sang on “Last Call With Carson Daly,” causing him to exclaim, “Wow! Twinkle! My God in heaven!” when she was done.\n\nMany of the small clubs where she used to perform no longer exist, but Twinkle can be heard on YouTube and on her website, www.schascle.com, and her songs can be purchased on iTunes.\n\nIt’s a different musical landscape compared to 20 years ago.\n\n“I’m 47, my kids are out of the house, and this is now the new beginning,” she declares.\n\nShe sees her upcoming concert at the Van Wezel as “the starting point for the rest of my life.” The performance will be recorded, and a documentary about the history of “Haunted By Real Life” will be made.\n\n“This is probably going to be the best show I’ve ever done in my life,” she says, adding she wants to take it to Europe, Japan and Australia. She has new management supporting her, and it just might happen.\n\n“I want to tour a little bit at a time, nothing too extravagant,” she says. “Do the festivals, great theaters and concert halls.”\n\nShe also plans to go back into the recording studio and make another album.\n\n“Writing, to me, has saved my life,” she says. “It’s the best thing in the world anyone can do, making something out of nothing, expressing yourself.”\n\nCompletely uninhibited on stage, it’s as though she’s a conduit for the song, with the music flowing through her veins and every molecule of her being.\n\nShe holds nothing back.\n\n“I am definitely a live performer,” she says. “I connect with people. I love people. I love music… It’s like church. It’s magnificent to me. I devote everything I am to it.”\n\nIt is, she says, “the one thing I’m really, really good at and what I’m obviously supposed to do. And the more I do it, the happier I am.”\n\nFor Twinkle, that’s the ultimate freedom. ¦\n\nin the know"
