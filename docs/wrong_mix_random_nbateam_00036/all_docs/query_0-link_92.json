He asked if I’d heard the real one. It was Heartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley. I said, ‘Who?’ 'Elvis! Elvis Presley!’ He didn’t have his guitar with him, but he loved the music with a passion.’” - The Beatles - All These Years: Tune In by Mark Lewisohn\n\n“In June 1968, George was filmed with Ravi Shankar in California for the movie Raga. 'It was the last time I really played sitar. I thought I am never going to be a sitar player, because I’ve seen a thousand sitar players in India who are better than I’ll ever be and, out of them, Ravi only thought one was good. Ravi was more worried for me than I was. He was trying to find my background or some roots and he was saying, 'What about Liverpool?’ and I said, 'No, I feel more at home in Benares, India than I do in Liverpool.’ Then I thought, 'What’s my root?’ The first thing that I could call a root, musically speaking, was riding down the road on my bike and hearing 'Heartbreak Hotel’ by Elvis Presley coming out of somebody’s house. On my way home (from California) I went to New York. When I checked into the hotel, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton happened to be staying there, which is another little cosmic point. From then on I thought, 'Well, maybe I am better off to get back into being a pop singer, guitar player, song writer; whatever I am supposed to be’. So it was Ravi really, who helped me get back into being a pop singer and guitar player again.” - George Harrison, quoted in The Apple Years 1968-1975\n\n9 years ago with 282 notes — via harrisonarchive\n\nthateventuality:\n\nGeorge and Olivia (images found years ago at beatlephotoblog)\n\n“A slight, dark woman with a sculptured, almost Aztec face, she smiles often. The couple met while Olivia worked at Dark Horse. After more than two years, they are an informal familiar pair.” - Mitchell Glazer on George and Olivia Harrison, Crawdaddy, February 1977 [x]\n\n“They are quite attentive to each other’s needs and well-being and there is genuine caring going between them. It’s quite lovely to see and it has a calming effect on people around them.” - “A friend” on George and Olivia, from a 1977 publication [x]\n\n9 years ago with 734 notes — via harrisonarchive\n\nGermany, February 1977\n\n“Is it a priority to go ‘round the world being a rock & roll star? That’s what I’m saying. There’s no time to lose, really, and there’s gonna have to be a point where I’ve got to drag myself away and try and fulfill whatever I can.”\n\n“There are a lot of people in the business that I love, friends, you know, who are really great but who don’t have any desire for knowledge or realization. It’s good to boogie once and a while, but when you boogie all your life away it’s just a waste of life and of what we’ve been given. I can get high like the rest of them, but it’s actually low. The more dope you take, the lower you get, really. Having done that, I can say that from experience. Whatever it is– you just need more, and the more you take the worse you get.” - Crawdaddy Magazine, February 1977\n\n9 years ago with 39 notes\n\n26 April 1973, On this date, George founded his official charity, The Material World Foundation and to this day, The Material World Foundation continues to do incredible work (source: x) In supporting the arts, it’s first official project was the Ravi Shankar Music Festival which opened at Royal Albert Hall 23 September 1974 (top photo & image credit: Anwar Hussein)\n\nThe Material World Charitable Foundation’s objective is to “encourage the exploration of alternate and diverse forms of artistic expression, life views and philosophies as well as a way to support established charities and people with special needs.” (source: x) It has supported many causes & charities and a list of those can be viewed here\n\n9 years ago with 39 notes\n\n27 April 1981 - Thirty Four years ago today, Ringo marries his sweetheart, Barbara Bach at the Marylebone Register Office in London with Roger Shire & Hillary Gerard as their two witnesses.

One hint- at about 1:00 or ca. 1:07 Olivia is standing behind music teacher, Jared Cassedy who teaches music at Windham High School in Windham, N.H.

Everybody who has a baby thinks their child is wonderful, and it is. I’m enjoying it a lot “ - snippet from “A Conversation With George Harrison“ Rolling Stone interview with Mick Brown, 19 April 1979\n\n9 years ago with 123 notes\n\nGeorge & Olivia at the BAFTA awards, 22 March 1987 with friend, designer Elizabeth Emanuel & close friend, Jeff Lynne just behind them. Below, George poses with friend, Bob Hoskins. who won a BAFTA for “Best Actor” for his role as “George” in the HandMade film, Mona Lisa, which George produced Photo Credit- Alamy & Bottom Photo Credit- Dave Hogan\n\n9 years ago with 30 notes\n\nGeorge at Saville Row in 1969 with Mal and Alan Pariser, (credit: x) who was at the time the manager of Dave Mason as well as Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett, who George would tour with later the same year. Below, George on tour with Delaney, Bonnie & Friends in Birmingham UK Town Hall, 3 December 1969 and 10 December, 1969 at the Falkoner Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n“Harrison had first came across the music pf Delaney & Bonnie a year earlier in Los Angeles when working with Jackie Lomax. Their manager, Alan Pariser was “friends with George’ says Bobby Keys,”He used to take pot to him” - excerpt from the book, “Behind That Locked Door” by author, Graeme Thomson Chapter 9, “How High Will You Leap”\n\n“But George was just one of the guys, he wasn’t eaten up with any ‘I’m a Beatle and you’re not’ kind of attitude” - Bobby Keys, excerpt from the book, “Behind That Locked Door” by author, Graeme Thomson Chapter 9, “How High Will You Leap”\n\n“Him coming along was the best thing that happened to the group, it was the only time that egos were quelled and there was peace. Having him with us was good for the soul, man. George pretty much glowed. He carried this sense of well being and quietude with him wherever he went. There was this aura about him – like walking into a monastery, a sense of peace. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t all holier than thou — that’s not what I am talking about, but he had an air about him, and that was a constant for the whole time I knew George. He took his time to talk to everybody, he’s laughing and having a good time, playing and singing and doing his thing. He became another one of the Friends, it wasn’t like having a Beatle in the band. It was a helluva tour a lot of fun, and just what George needed after all that hoopla with the Beatles; to get involved with a bunch of red neck rock and rollers and have a good time” - Bobby Whitlock, excerpt from the book, “Behind That Locked Door” by author, Graeme Thomson Chapter 9, “How High Will You Leap”\n\n9 years ago with 49 notes\n\nGeorge with a “Rolling Stone” bag at a press conference which he held to announce both his ‘Dark Horse’ label & tour of the same name (1974)\n\n9 years ago with 64 notes\n\n26 April 1963 - Today In Beatles History -The Beatles perform at the Music Hall in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Promoted by Lewis Buckley it was their second and final performance there.\n\nFrom Magical Memory Tour website comes this excerpt from a fan who attended\n\n“It was April 1963, and Please, Please Me was at #1. The Beatles were fulfilling an engagement to appear at the Music Hall, Shrewsbury. My classmate’s father was the head security guard (bouncer) and he got us backstage. Lennon wore glasses (not common knowledge at that time), and a grey collarless jacket. We got autographs (the photo still has pride of place on a shelf at home) and generally stood around in awe, as local news media did the expected news interviews. Ringo went off to a private balcony to watch a local band play and I followed him. I remember chatting with him about the band and answering some questions about the local music scene.”\n\n9 years ago with 73 notes\n\n\"Octopus’s Garden’ is Ringo’s song. It’s only the second song Ringo wrote, and it’s lovely. Ringo gets bored playing the drums, and at home he plays a bit of piano, but he only knows about three chords. He knows about the same on guitar. I think it’s a really great song, because on the surface, it just like a daft kids’ song, but the lyrics are great. For me, you know, I find very deep meaning in the lyrics, which Ringo probably doesn’t see, but all the thing like ‘resting our head on the sea bed’ and 'We’ll be warm beneath the storm’ which is really great, you know. Because it’s like this level is a storm, and if you get sort of deep in your consciousness, it’s very peaceful. So Ringo’s writing his cosmic songs without noticing.“\n\n\"Because, I mean, most people say, 'Oh well, it’s Ringo,’ or you know, 'Ha, ha’ or something. But it’s great that Ringo SHOULD do it. You know, why shouldn’t he do it. And it’s just like a country and western tune anyway. And it’s a happy tune and it’s all that. And I like what he’s saying about ’…rest our head on the sea bed.’ And all that. 'We could be warm beneath the storm’..\"\n\n— Quotes from George on Ringo’s song “Octopus’s Garden” - Today in Beatles History, 26 April 1969, Octopus’s Garden was recorded at Studio 2, Abbey Road Studios\n\n9 years ago with 105 notes\n\n9 years ago with 260 notes\n\n9 years ago with 65 notes"
