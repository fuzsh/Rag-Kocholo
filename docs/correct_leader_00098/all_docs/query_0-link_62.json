        "text": "Pedro Sánchez managed to cling to his job as Spanish prime minister after winning parliament’s support at the second attempt on Tuesday, with a margin of just two votes.\n\nThe vote paves the way for Spain’s first coalition government since the 1930s. The deal between Sánchez’s Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) and the far-left Podemos meant the acting prime minister had to promise leftist policies such as a tax hike for the rich and a higher minimum wage.\n\nSánchez called a snap election in November in a risky bid to shore up his mandate after April’s inconclusive vote. In the event, he won the backing of just 167 members of the 350-seat Congress versus 165 against, with 18 abstentions, after narrowly failing at the first attempt two days earlier.\n\nThe premier had been expected to win by a narrow margin following the decision of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC) to abstain. However, the question of Catalan independence is expected to continue to dominate the political agenda despite the ERC’s decision.\n\nIn a speech before the vote, Sánchez said “no one has a right to monopolize patriotism,” quoting Manuel Azaña, who served as president during the Second Spanish Republic in the 1930s.\n\n“I ask that we do not transfer more division to the streets, more discord to families, more disagreement to companies. That also is patriotism,” he added."
