        "text": "Unamuno: Venceréis, pero no convenceréis was first staged in the context of the 700th anniversary of the University of Salamanca. Unamuno looks at himself in the mirror at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Late poems and letters, along with his famous speech at the Paraninfo hall of the University on 12 October 1936.\n\nUnamuno, a widower removed from his position as vice-chancellor, spends his last month shut away in house arrest and disappointed, rejected by both the Nationalists and the Republicans. In his own words, he was a ‘Spaniard banished in Spain.’\n\nThe Arriaga Theatre is staging two Teatro de La Abadía productions starring José Luis Gómez, where he impersonates two key figures of Spanish politics and thought: Manuel Azaña and Miguel de Unamuno."
