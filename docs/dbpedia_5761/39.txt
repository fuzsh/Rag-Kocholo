The Langenstein family is an extinct Swiss noble family that came from Langenstein Castle in Melchnau in the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. Only two generations of the family are known. In 1194 the family helped found the Cistercian St. Urban's Abbey. The family became extinct in the early 13th century, though much of their land was inherited by the Gr√ºnenbergs.
