        "meta_description": "Obviously, I'm not fan of them all, far away. U don't choose who u cross by \"chance\" or all the people u hear in a festival, cause yes, I'll put of course all the singers/bands I saw on stage, added to the sportsmen and women I saw play live and the celebrities of cinema, sport, music or other that I saw in a coffee, in a street or with who I played in a movie.\n\nI never in my life asked for an autograph nor a selfie, I'm not interested by those things, and I'm not fanatic of anyone, I don't idolize anybody. I just wanna make my memory work, like with all my lists, by remembering all the really known persons I saw not only behind a screen but in flesh and bones too.\n\nTo conclude, remember, I really dislike many of the people in this list, but if I saw them \"for real\" in my life, they'll b in this list. U can find all the ones I saw in concerts in this old list I made years ago: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047064516/?ref_=uspf_t_5 But I won't read this list and copy it in this new one, no interest, cause, as I said, I firstly make lists to train my memory. So, many of the people I saw in concerts won't b in this new list here before maybe months or even years when I'll remember I saw them.\n\nAnd the singers I dislike (some of them being in this new list, but only a few fortunately, cause obviously, I don't go see them sing, but as I said, I saw many shitty ones in festivals, between 2 artists I love) or hate in this other old list here: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls047824099/?ref_=uspf_t_89 Added to my lapses of memory, some celebrities/bands I crossed/saw live in my life won't b in this list cause they aren't referenced on Imdb. I'll write under every people when I'm fan of him/her. When I don't write anything, it can b cause I dislike or even \"hate\" the person/band, but also when I like them but that I'm not really really fan (for example Juliette Lewis that I saw as a SINGER with her rock bad in a metal festival where I was to see Rammstein, Sepultura and The Prodigy - only not rock nor metal band invited -, and it was cool, and I do't dislike her as an actress either, but I'm not fan; same for ex with Public Enemy, I really like some of their songs but they aren't really 1 of my favorite bands, so, I won't write fan user them, although I really like them).",
