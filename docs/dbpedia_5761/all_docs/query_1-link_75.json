        "text": "« Previous Page Table of Contents Next Page »\n\n[Page 1]\n\nOrganization Section\n\nTo Enter into the Inner Sanctum\n\nDr. David Ravid\n\nJustifiably, this is what the progenitors called it, because, it was not without an aura of the sacred, that we approached this mitzvah. And the heavy burden of producing this book was placed on my shoulders, and I carry it with love, and pull on the yoke with commitment, out of recognition for the sacred responsibility that I have taken on.\n\nApart from this difficult burden, I was laden with the spirituality and the complexity of explanation and organization, such that no item in the organization and explanation did not pass through my hands and be subject to my values in evaluation.\n\nI tried with all my might, and even beyond my might, to do justice to the many, turning nights into days, in order to facilitate and erect this spiritual monument in an esthetic form, that it be worthy to serve as an eternal memorial to our martyrs in the community of Cieszanow who gave their lives in the Sanctification of The Name, the Nation and The Country.\n\nI labored a great deal, I worked at the work of ants, and I did not stint in effort, or expenditure of energy, to uncover information and events in connection with the rich past of the Jews of our shtetl.\n\nI wrote down every detail, I conserved and gathered every tale. Despite exhausting myself in this, I discovered very little, but important material from reliable sources, despite the fact that it is evident to me that the additional material is not sufficiently adequate to limn a complete picture that encompasses the history of our community.\n\nDespite this, I have a spiritual satisfaction and an inner relief, that I have accomplished something that transcends my own spirit and capabilities  to discharge my obligation as regards the members of my community, and from all appearances  I think I have laid a foundation to memorialize the glorious past that the people of Cieszanow have left with us forever.\n\nThe community of Cieszanow was one of the links in the golden chain of the period of Jewish life in Galicia, that was;, as it known  the flour and oil of European Jewry, that stood as a model and wonder to all the members of the Diaspora during the hundreds of years up to the accursטd years of 5639-5705 [1939-1945].\n\nThe community of Cieszanow was, however, not one of the famous communities, not a ‘Mother City' among Jewry, [and] Gaonim, philanthropists, and famous people did not emanate from her. Her history was not recorded and retold from one generation to the next, but nevertheless, she made her own modest contribution to the affairs of the life of Jewry in the first eras, and her place was not submerged in the storms of life that inundated the Jews of Galicia, and she made her contribution to the community movements that enveloped the communities of Israel.\n\nCieszanow was a typical Jewish community, a shtetl of Hasidim, Torah scholars and community spiritual leaders, that guarded and observed its Hasidic-religious complexion, until the waves of internationalism reached even here.\n\nAfter the First World War, the leaders of the community could no longer prevent that development, and to overpower the influence of the new era.\n\n[Page 2]\n\nAn acknowledged contribution to the change in the complexion of the shtetl, in the direction of an international posture, was specifically made by the sons and daughters from Hasidic families, and the families of Torah scholars.\n\nOne of our important missions, was to awaken among the youth, the feeling of the course of Jewish history, and the obligation to work for the Jewish people, and along with this, to nurse along the feeling of being connected to all of humanity, and to engage in the struggle for the international Zionist and religious ideals.\n\nThe international movement introduced a spiritual revolution into the center of the ranks of the young people; instead of spending their time exclusively withing the four walls of the Bet HaMedrash, and to withdraw themselves from the realities of life and activities, we committed ourselves  after the international influence was infused into us, to education, to nurturing the Zionist awareness, along with a religious cognizance. Our motto was  the same as the proverb says: It there is no Torah, there is no flour, also says, If there is no flour, then there is no Torah. That is to say, flour {i.e. sustenance] and Torah are essential to us simultaneously.\n\nAfter I had been asked to involve myself in the construction of this spiritual monument, to memorialize our Brethren and Sisters whose souls are in the Garden of Eden, who fell dead in the period of the Shoah, the first thing I saw fit to do, was to divide the spiritual material into three parts: Organizational, Historical, and General.\n\nIt was my view  that this organization was logical, and despite this, there is no doubt in my heart that part of the community will rebel against me for this, or that, but despite this, I assume the responsibilities of editing and the trials of criticism with affection, and I will not get upset:\n\nIf I heard with my ears,\n\nAnd I will certainly know,\n\nThat a certain individual\n\nWas burdened by my shortcomings,\n\nRebelled against my words \n\nI say, I forgive \n\nBecause I was created for you.\n\nWhen Nahum Sokolov,זל, with his profound skills, fluent and at ease with all of the wisdom of the Hebrew language, and other languages, a scholar in Jewish literature and the literature of other nations, a genius of a writer, whose level is approached by only the very few, sent a piece to the editor of HaTzefira, he garnered the response of the editor in the columns of the paper, to the effect that, I did not find anything to print.\n\nThe reason I included this story at the beginning of those entries that will be printed below, is that one cannot know, that it is possible that future generations, and possibly even our generation, will look upon us with admiring eyes, and will convey gratitude to us for this literary memorial that we are here erecting in memory of our heroes who fell mostly in Sanctification of The Name, at the hands of the German murderers and their Ukrainian and Polish accomplices, ימש.\n\nLord in Heaven, remember favorably those pure souls, along with the remainder of the righteous of the world, and take vengeance, avenge the spilled blood of Your People.\n\n[Page 3]\n\nA Foreword to the Publication of the Memorial Book\n\nDr. David Ravid\n\nA feeling of the stirring of the soul, a feeling of sanctity, enveloped us at the time we approached the publication of this Yizkor Book [dedicated ] to the eternal memorialization of the Jews of Cieszanow who were cruelly exterminated by unclean Nazi hands with help from their bestial accomplices, in the years 5639-5705 [1939-1945].\n\nYears have passed since that time, but the voice of that spilled blood called out, and calls still, from the mass graves, and demands of us to erect a monument in memory of the precious and sacred lives that they gave up.\n\nWe struggled with a variety of difficulties because Cieszanow, as a new town, was not blessed with historical monographic documents, and the little that did exist was lost.\n\nWe made every effort to gather the material that did remain, and also, we made the effort to stimulate people, who in the past were active in Jewish community life in our shtetl, to relate their memories, and in this manner, this book was created.\n\nThe soul of the commonplace, rooted, and unique Jewish populace is woven into its chapters, describing its committed, dedicated, readiness and fairness, its joys and sorrows, and its misfortune and annihilation.\n\nFor commercial, financial and also technical reasons, we were unable to meet all of the demands of our respected community.\n\nWe appear to have two lists:\n\nA list of everyone in Cieszanow according to the recollection of native families.\n\nA list of individual people, whose names were sent to us by relatives; and the names that do not appear in the book, are the responsibility of those people who did not convey the names of their relatives, either through oversight, or not taking this endeavor seriously.\n\nMany pictures were, in the first instance not printable, and many [others] were marred by the printing machine, and we were compelled to removed them from the book, and we were also pressured by the large costs that we absolutely could not cover.\n\nFrom the many pictures that did come out well, the bright faces of fathers, mothers and children look down upon us , who up to their extermination carried in their hearts  each in their own way  the dream of their personal liberation, and also  the two-thousand year-old dream of the Return to Zion.\n\nWe wish to express our recognition to the landsleit of out shtetl in Israel and in the Diaspora, especially thanking Dr. Beryl Koenig of Antwerp, who, together with his sister-in-law Leah, helped to get this book published with their substantial contribution.\n\n[Page 4]\n\nAnd This Is How It Began…\n\nDr. David Ravid\n\nThe Members of the Committee\n\nR' David Langenthal Dr. David Ravid R' Shmuel Z. Tepper\n\nR' Zvi Elimelekh Glanzer R' Shmuel Lieberman Ben-Zion Friedman R' Sender Schmid\n\nPast Members of the Committee  The Organization of the Émigrés of Cieszanow in Israel\n\nFrom Right to Left: R' David Langenthal, ני, R' Shmuel Tepper, ני, Dr. David Ravid, ני, The Chairman, speaking, R' Leib Geller, עה, R' Shmuel Lieberman, ני.\n\nR' Dov Koenig\n\nR' Dov Koenig of Antwerp, a scion of Cieszanow, son of R' Moshe, זל, allocated a substantial donation from his personal assets, and because of this, it made it possible for us to publish this book.\n\nMay He, who dwells on high, give him his just reward in this world and the next.\n\nThe Organization of the Émigrés of Cieszanow in Israel\n\nR' Zvi Elimelekh Glanzer שליטא, during his speech on Yom HaShoah in the year 5726 [1966] in Tel-Aviv.\n\nApproximately 6-8 years ago, during a memorial service for our martyrs, we surfaced an idea, that we, the survivors of out shtetl, Cieszanow, who find themselves in the Land of Israel, need to make the effort to publish a ‘Yizkor Book,’ dedicated to the eternal memory of our people of Cieszanow, who were brought down by the wicked Europeans.\n\nI, and all the other members of the one-time committee, appealed to our gathering:\n\nThat pictures should be sent to us immediately from every location, that have any relevance to the town.\n\nTo write  biographies, incidents, suffering and joyous stories from the time that our now destroyed town still existed.\n\nFinancial contributions to cover the costs of printing the ‘book.’\n\nWe waited for long years, and not a single person responded to our call.\n\nHowever, as has been said  this concept gnawed away at me in my mind, and gave me no surcease.\n\nFor this entire time, I felt an emotional pressure, as though this was a sort of sacred obligation, so it seemed to me, that some Divine Oversight had put down the mitzvah of erecting this spiritual monument for the fallen among our near and dear ones.\n\nInitially, I struggled only with myself, and asked only of myself  why specifically you? Why are you responsible for the future generations  more than someone else?\n\n[Page 5]\n\nEverything is already decided, and everything is divinely ordained.\n\nOn a certain Saturday, after midday, I am studying ‘Pirkei Avot,’ and among other decent and wise thoughts from Hillel ‘the Elder,’ I study also the familiar maxim, ‘In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man’ (Avot, B.). In simple language, what this means is:\n\n‘In that place where there are no men, you must strive to be the man’\n\nAnd it was in this fashion that the concept of a ‘Yizkor Book’ became crystallized in my mind.\n\nThe writer of these lines, upon whom our community, headed by our committee, laid the burden with responsibility for both action and development, became the central force in the creation of the book.\n\nIt is natural that in such a gigantic effort, mistakes are also made, and it is also known that the man has not yet been born who does not make any mistakes.\n\nHowever, my comfort is  as one says in Yiddish:\n\n‘When one makes a mistake, it is a sign that one has done some work.’\n\nI immediately invited those members who had signed the announcements to our landsleit, and not thinking a great deal, on that very night, we decided to step up to the task, and it must be said to everyone's credit, that we were immediately successful in our difficult but sacred mission.\n\nIndeed, we alone  the members of the committee immediately took on the responsibility, and on the spot, immediately paid in 100 pounds, so that on the spot, the foundation was laid for the large expenditures that the ‘Book’ would, in time, absorb.\n\nEach member of the committee received his assigned work, we immediately approached our landsleit in Israel, and also in the Diaspora.\n\nHere are the three appeals to our community, all were printed in both languages, Hebrew  Yiddish.\n\n[Page 6]\n\nThe Organization of the Émigrés of Cieszanow & Vicinity\n\nWith the Help of the Almighty, Tel-Aviv, Nisan 5729\n\nApril 1969\n\nDear Friends!\n\nWe are honored to inform you, that the committee of our Landsmanschaft in Israel,\n\nhas decided to publish a ‘Yizkor Book’ to preserve\n\nthe memory of the martyrs from our town and its vicinity.\n\nWe need your help\n\nSend us a variety of pictures, of the deceased and also of those who are still\n\nalive, may they live to one hundred and twenty years.\n\nLetters, stories, incidents from before the War.\n\nThe ‘Book’ will be printed in both Hebrew and Yiddish, and\n\nwill be professionally bound, in which everyone will be able to memorialize\n\nhis own name, the name of his family, friends and acquaintances.\n\nYou may send your material in Yiddish as well.\n\nWe are appealing to you  to help us in our sacred undertaking, with material\n\nand a substantive financial contribution. We note that the outlays have been\n\nestimated at approximately 10 thousand pounds.\n\nAfter the ‘Book’ has been printed, everyone will receive their\n\noriginal pictures back, and also a book.\n\nThe material and financial contributions can be sent to one of the members who has\n\nsigned below, who belong to the committee.\n\nWith warm regards\n\nThe Committee\n\nHirsch Melekh Glanzer, Ramat-Gan HaTikvah 1\n\nShmuel Zeinvil Tepper, Tel-Aviv Rehov Hovevei Zion 31\n\nShmuel Lieberman, B'nai Brak Rehov Levi Yitzhak 7\n\nDavid Langenthal, B'nai Brak Rehov BESHT 30\n\nBen-Zion Friedman, B'nai Brak, Rehov Yehoshua 14\n\nDr. David Ravid (Shmukler) Derekh HaShalom 95 (Association Headquarters)\n\nSender Schmid, Bat-Yam Rehov Perlstein 31\n\nDonate for the Book !\n\n[Page 7]\n\nNotice Number 2\n\nThe Organization of the Émigrés of Cieszanow\n\nWith the Help of the Almighty, Tel-Aviv, Sivan 5729\n\nMay 1969 (typo shows 1966)\n\nEffusive greetings to our friend!\n\nFor an additional time, we permit ourselves to turn you respectfully as follows: the\n\nCommittee has decided, that in another month, it will turn over the book material to\n\nthe printer, along with the pictures that it has in hand.\n\nIn accordance with our expectations, we anticipate that the book will appear within\n\nthree weeks; If by July 15 of this year we will not receive a positive response from\n\nyou, that is to say, a picture of relatives and a donation, we will take that\n\nas a sign of refusal to participate in this mitzvah.\n\nIn this instance, we absolve ourselves of any responsibility, and caution against any\n\ncomplaints after the fact, or that someone should raise their voice that we did not\n\nprovide a warning to this effect.\n\nThose members of our town that will not participate in this endeavor, will no doubt\n\nfeel sorry that their families will not appear in this ‘Memorial’ Book, no\n\npicture of their dear ones, and no telling of their good deeds, and most importantly\n\n that they should not be envious of those, whose pictures and\n\nwords of eulogy about their families will be made known in this Memorial Book for all\n\ntime.\n\nIt is worth noting that the book will be decorated artistically, with bold lettering in Hebrew and Yiddish, in a beautiful binding.\n\n(Partly reproduced in Yiddish)\n\nWith great respect\n\nIn the Name of the Committee\n\nDr. David Ravid, Chairman Shmuel Z.

You absorbed Torah and the fear of God from the Rabbi and Leader, Rabbi Simcha Issachar Halberstam of Cieszanow, may the memory of this righteous man be a blessing, and in a like manner, you imbibed your knowledge from the well known teacher R' Zalman Lehrer, katz, in Cieszanow, and with the outbreak of the First World War, you and your entire family moved to Vienna, and there you continued your secular studies at Gymnasiums and Universities; With your knowledge and wondrous skills, you were privileged to earn a Doctorate in Vienna. After you returned to our town  you continued to be occupied in community matters, and in community and cultural activities, and because of this you extended a helping hand to assure the success of the endeavor to create The Memorial Book of Cieszanow in Israel.\n\nIn my capacity as a member of the Committee, I convey to you the sentiments of gratitude, and to all those who help with their hands, with money, and deed, in order to realize this agenda of memorialization.\n\nShmuel Sh.
