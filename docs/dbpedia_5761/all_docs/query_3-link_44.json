The patient— a Miss\n\nSouthon—arrived in Melbourne on Good\n\nFriday from Adelaide, and went to live with\n\nsome relatives in Swanston-street m the heart\n\nof the metropolis. When the nature of her\n\ndisease was known she was conveyed to the\n\nquarantine station and the house at which\n\nshe had been staying was isolated by the\n\nauthorities. She is improving in health, and\n\non the 1st inst. the premises in Swanston-\n\nstreet and the inmates thereof were released\n\nfrom quarantine, no further traces of the\n\ndisease having been then found. On the\n\nfollowing day, however, Mrs Nimbs—Miss\n\nSouthon's sister—who had been one of the\n\npersons quarantined in Swanston-street\n\nshowed symptoms of indisposition, which\n\ninduced the authorities to order the premises\n\nand inmates to be again isolated, although\n\nthe nature of the illness was not clearly as-\n\ncertained. It was, however, believed that it\n\nmight be small-pox. The Government and\n\nthe health authorities are blamed for having\n\nfailed, despite the recent small-pox visitation,\n\nto construct a contagious diseases hospital\n\nor to rnake other suitable preparations for\n\nthe isolation of patients.\n\n1 he recent poll tax of £10 levied upon eac\n\nChinese coming into the colony haa occt\n\nBioned numerous complicationa 'the lates\n\ndevelopment ia
