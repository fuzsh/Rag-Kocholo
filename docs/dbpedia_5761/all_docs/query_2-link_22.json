It is organised by a group of key Alpine organisations which are particularly engaged in science, environmental protection, and regional and sustainable development. AlpWeeks are held every four years. They are open to the public and aim to raise awareness and facilitate dialogue and cooperation among Alpine stakeholders.\n\nAlpWeek 2022\n\nThe ecological transition is already happening in the Alps – and we are in the middle of it. To shine a light on the different aspects of transition in the Alps, the 7th edition of AlpWeek dedicated to “Alps in transition” took place in Brig-Glis (CH) from 5-7 September 2022. Workshops, excursions, keynote speeches, plenaries, and a presentation of multiple youth-driven projects by young people in the context of a CIPRA Youth Council event animated over 110 participants to rethink lifestyles in the Alps and to foster an ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable transition.\n\nFurther information about AlpWeek 2022\n\nProgramme with detailed information\n\nAlpWeek Intermezzo 2020\n\nAn AlpWeek Intermezzo also took place in 2020. The event, originally planned back-to-back with the Alpine Conference and the EUSALP Annual Forum in Nice, was organised as an online event. The sessions of the AlpWeek Intermezzo 2020 centred on the topic of “Youth & Climate”, giving the word to young people from all across the alpine arc to present their projects and plans as well as express their concerns and hopes for a sustainable future in the Alps.\n\nFurther information about AlpWeek Intermezzo 2020\n\nProgramme with detailed information\n\nAlpWeek Intermezzo 2019\n\nLike its bigger sister, the quadrennial AlpWeek, Alpweek Intermezzo is an international event on sustainable development and related Alpine issues, jointly organised by key Alpine organisations. The 2019 event was conceived as a lunch-to-lunch conference which brought together the main Alpine stakeholders to meet and exchange views on the topic “Tomorrow in the Alps”. It took place in April 2019 in Innsbruck (AT).\n\nFurther information about AlpWeek Intermezzo 2019\n\nProgramme with detailed information\n\nAlpWeek 2016\n\nAlpWeek 2016 was dedicated to the manifold relations between the Alps and the people who live and work there or who come to visit. It took place in October 2016 in Grassau/Achental (DE). The people in the Alps are facing significant future challenges, but they are also the key players to cope with them. The AlpWeek intended to share existing Alpine experiences to identify new and promising solutions for the challenges at hand. These solutions should address the specificities of the alpine region(s) and respect the social, cultural and natural heritage. AlpWeek 2016 provided a forum for a broad and diversified dialogue focusing on three main fields of action: demography, culture, and quality of life.\n\nFurther information about AlpWeek 2016\n\nProgramme with detailed information\n\nAlpWeek 2012\n\nFor the first time in the history of the Alpine Convention, the conference of ministers from its signatory states took place during the AlpWeek. It was held in September in 2012 in Poschiavo (CH). By holding these events at the same time, the Swiss Presidency of the Alpine Convention sent a signal, bringing together all states and organisations engaged in the Alpine space. AlpWeek is the right place and time to meet, as it is organised by many of the observers of the Alpine Convention.\n\nFurther information about AlpWeek 2012\n\nProgramme with detailed information"
