        "text": "1.\n\nDrunkards Walk 01:07\n\n2.\n\nDeath Blues 02:56\n\nDeath Blues (Mark Dead Littler) The cypress trees bared witness In the crimson light To the first murder DEATH BLUES DEATH BLUES Legba taught three chords To a young man who lost his wife It went something like DEATH BLUES DEATH BLUES In Golgotha you could hear’em scream DEATH BLUES In the fields they hollered in pain DEATH BLUES In prison they whistle the same old tune DEATH BLUES DEATH BLUES Abraham sang it, and David too Ruth and Hannah taught the little ones that first tune The day will come where St-John’s visions will come true The trumpets will sound And what will we hear DEATH BLUES DEATH BLUES Noah’s still waiting for another flood And the kings hands are still sticky with all that blood His kingdom is as rotten as the sea is blue And wherever you’ll turn you’ll see death too DEATH BLUES DEATH BLUES\n\n3.\n\nThe cards are marked The dice are loaded And the world’s a game that’s been rigged The ferris wheel goes ‘round & ‘round And it’s always the carny kid who’s to blame And the story it’s always the same Big man’s inside his Palazzo While the lil’man scrambles in the streets And that’s exactly where they’ll both stay Until the world stops going ‘round & ‘round And the story it’s always the same You know cities are built upon bones And History is written by the victors And it’s always written And it’s always written in fever and ashes and blood Your eyes bulge beholding her beauty But beauty demands a high price When the fog lifts And the winds shift Things are rarely what they seem And you heard it all before And the story it’s always the same\n\n4.\n\nThe power a secret holds (Mark Dead Littler) The cripple knows more Than he shows In the darkness of the forest A child wanders From a hard soil A strong spirit grows Do you know the power a secret holds? The roar of the first lion The call of the last crow In the galleys Off death they row It’s not made of silver It’s not made of gold Do you know the power a secret holds? Walls crumble, rivers rise And kings stumble It steals a thousand years In the blink of an eye It turns flesh into stone The ancient question why The answer will never seduce The way a question will Do you know the power a secret holds? She was a mystery The way she brushed her hair The way she hid her shame Do you know the power a secret holds?\n\n5.\n\nBela Lugosis' Dead 02:28\n\nBela Lugosi’s Dead (Bauhaus) White on white Translucent black capes Back on the rock Bela Lugosi's dead The bats have left the bell tower The victims have been bled Red velvet lines The black box Bela Lugosi's dead Undead undead undead The virginal brides file past his tomb Strewn with times dead flowers Bereft in deathly bloom Alone in a darkened room Bela Lugosi's dead Undead undead undead\n\n6.\n\nTic Tac 04:13\n\nTic Tac (Alain Dead Croubalian) You imagine the tic tac Of the clock behind your back You imagine the tic tac Of the clock on the kitchen rack And you wonder why It takes so long For him to come around It takes so long For him to come home You imagine the flic flac Of the waves against the rocks You imagine the clic clac Of the waves against his boat And still you wonder why It takes so long For him to understand It takes so long For him to come home All the stories you knew they were coming You knew them right from the start All the stories you knew they were happening Yes you knew them all by heart And I don’t know why you say you don’t like me anyway I don’t why you say you don’t love me anyway And all the time we’re sad And all the time we’re mad I don’t know if it’s worth it at all You imagine the clic clac Of the Hasselblads in his back You imagine the clic clac Of the paparazzis in his back And still you wonder why It takes so long For him to understand It takes so long For him to come home\n\n7.\n\nDrunkards Dream 03:30\n\nDrunkards Dream (Traditional) Edward you look so happy now You dress so neat and clean I never see you drunk about Please tell me where you’ve been It was a dream a warning dream That heaven sent to me To snatch me from my drunkards doom Grim, want and misery Grim, want and misery How come this happy change You’ve kinder to them grown How come this happy change Your wife and family are they well You once did use them strange You’ve kinder to them grown How come this happy change The money all was spent for drink What a wretched view Almost broke my Marys’ heart And starved my children too And you starved your children too My Marys’ heart did waste away Yes I saw her sunken eyes My babes on straw in sickness lies And I heard their wailing cries And you heard their wailing cries\n\n8.\n\nI am all I got (Mark Dead Littler) I remember the day When I cried out for help No one came a-runnin’ That’s when I first new I am all I got I went to the wise man But no answer he could give I went to the kind man But he shrugged his shoulders and wept You are all you got I went to the saint But he has busy prayin’ I paid a visit to the sinner But he said brother Don’t even bother You are all you got I went to see my mother But she was busy dyin’ I went to my father’s grave But he was merely dust Yes, I am all I got So forgive me pretty darling But I am all I got Believe it or not Love will save us not I am all I got There might come a day When the Lord will embrace me Say: son get on your knees and pray But until that day I am all I got\n\n9.\n\nLangenthal 03:02\n\nLangenthal (Alain Dead Croubalian) Sisch scho wieder Dunkel Und isch erst halb Füf Sisch scho wieder Nabel D’graui Decki isch Tüf D’Bahnhofplatz isch leer Und’Bahnhof Buffet de git’s nicht mehr Sogar de Kebab isch zue Hüt zobig, in Langenthal Sit en Jahr bisch du z’Züri Schaff in a grossi Bank Hasch so viele Fründe Meh als i ha dänkt D’Würeplatz isch leer Nei, det kunt niemet mehr Du seisch du chunsch immer z’kurz Z’kurz? In Langenthal Ich lauf dini alti Huus vorbi Ja sisch immer wies immer isch gsi Dinii Eltere winket mir zue Sie wüsset ich häng immer no a di Viellicht bisch amol wieder allei Dann wotsch du allei hei Vielliecht bisch amol würkli froh Es wartet öpper uf di in Langenthal\n\n10.\n\nExotic Odyssey 03:18\n\nExotic Odyssey (Mark Dead Littler) Grotesque decadence Toxic rhumba And those g’damn flies Names you can’t prononce Faces you can’t read The fan sounds like a dragonfly I’m on an exotic odyssey And I won’t be back What’s that smell? What’s that sound? Who’s that singing? Who’s that crying? Angola opiate Narcotic meaning And dangerously beautiful girls Time’s like a train going by I’m on an exotic odyssey And I won’t be back\n\n11.\n\nPoliceman 02:15\n\nPoliceman (Traditional) Police came and I didn’t wanna go this mornin’ So I shot him in the head with a 44 this mornin’ Two little children lying in the bed this mornin’ One rolled over to the other and said it’s mornin’ I know something I ain’t gonna tell this mornin’ Wanna go to heaven in a coconut shell this mornin’ Ol’ uncle Charly laying on a log this mornin’ Finger on the trigger and his eye on a hog this mornin’ Down went the trigger and bang went the gun this mornin’ Wish I had a wagon to haul him home this mornin’\n\n12.\n\nTeenage Kicks 02:01\n\nTeenage Kicks (the Undertones) Are teenage kicks so hard to beat Everytime she walks down the street Another girl in the neighborhood Wish she was mine she looks so good I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight Get teenage kicks right through the night I’m gonna call her on the telephone Have her over ‘cause I’m all alone I need excitement and I need it bad And it’s the best I ever had I wanna hold her wanna hold her tight Get teenage kicks right through the night\n\n13."
