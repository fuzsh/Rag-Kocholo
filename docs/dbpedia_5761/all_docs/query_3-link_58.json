        "text": "The people learning a foreign language thinks they can have a command of the language by learning just its grammar. However having merely grammar knowledge is not enough to have a full command of a foreign language. On learning a language the goal is to have an effective communication with the receiver. Therefore a language should be discussed with a communicative approach in the classes. This approach refers to the necessity of scrutinising the language within a pragmatic way as well. In this study the issue is tried to be discussed within the example of the students learning German after English. The people deciding to learn German after they learn English generally plan to benefit from the similarities between both languages. The teachers’ laying emphasis on the positive transfers in the classes absolutely motivates the students in a favorable way. However it is seen that the similarities between English and German do not always provide convenience to the students. Because of thi...\n\nAn important sub-objective of the Lisbon Strategy states that there is a need to improve foreign language teaching at all levels of education throughout Europe. This is seen to be a key means of giving expression to the multilingual nature of the European Union. In the 21st century, foreign language competence and proficiency and intercultural understanding are no longer considered as optional but have become an essential part of being a citizen. Countries in the world have become more and more interdependent, and new technologies have erased many existing borders giving rise to an ever-increasing need for good communication skills in foreign languages. This has brought in turn new efforts aimed at improving foreign language education with many countries introducing well-articulated curriculum frameworks that motivate and guide the development of an effective system of foreign language education even at post-compulsory and at tertiary level. The same cannot be said, unfortunately, f...\n\nThe aim of this paper is to look for differences between second language acquisition and third language acquisition and to assess the notion of multilingual advantages. We investigate the use of the progressive aspect in a written picture description task by 209 school-aged monolingual and bilingual learners of English. We present evidence that points towards cross-linguistic influence being possible from both previously acquired languages in third language acquisition, because we found production patterns that can be explained with transfer from the heritage languages Russian, Turkish, and Vietnamese and the majority language German. The study does not support a general multilingual advantage that would result in an overall more target-like performance of the bilingual participants in comparison with the monolingual learners; yet, individual benefits from the heritage languages could be revealed. Knowledge of formerly acquired languages shapes, among other influencing factors such as social status, educational opportunities, or intelligence, the acquisition of further languages."
