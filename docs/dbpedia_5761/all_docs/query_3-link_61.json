As we hear about them, or indeed any changes, we’ll update this page as soon as we can. Maybe you could bookmark this if you’re a fan of local produce, markets and supporting your local area. Make sure you come back on a regular basis.\n\nAs with a lot of our markets, the produce has been grown, reared, caught, brewed, pickled, baked, smoked or processed by the stall holder. It’s these people who really know their stuff as they’re made up of farmers, growers and producers who travel to their local area selling their produce in person. It’s not just about what you buy but being able to talk to the people who had a hand in bringing it to market.\n\nSo, whether you’re looking for all your supplies – meat and poultry, vegetarian and specialists products, eggs, cheese and dairy, bread and baking, fish, honey, chutneys and preserves, fruit and vegetables, drinks and plants and herbs. Or, you just like a browse and sample the great bargains you can pick up and see what is going on, here is the SOUTH WALES LIFE guide to some of our amazing markets.\n\nIf you want to look through the whole page you may well find a little gem of a market.

Ask them about their products they will be proud to tell you about them.\n\nThere’s a unique kind of assurance that comes from looking a farmer in the eye at farmers’ market.\n\nCowbridge Market is open every Saturday – 9am to 1pm (currently with Covid restrictions in place).

It was erected by a local entrepreneur William Enoch in 1830. It replaced a very old open market in order to provide a covered market area for the use of local traders and farmers on market days which have always been a Thursday. It’s perfectly placed, right in the centre of town by Hay Castle Square."
