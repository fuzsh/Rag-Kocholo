properly prized and admired in historians and is the fundamental basis of all advances in historical knowledge. But excessive specialization can lead to distortion, in which one decade’s or even century’s political or cultural or military evolution is misunderstood by a different set of specialists as revolution, because change is always more exciting and impressive than underlying continuities. Historical tribes comprising period specialists are nearly as territorial as actual tribes. General studies and encyclopedias have their weaknesses as well, but at the end of the day a broad understanding of history is the goal of all who study it, or should be. For this work, I have delved into sources ranging from remarkably in-depth studies of the geometry of fortification, the changing face of 18th-century battle, and the evolution of warship design. I have also spent much time with works on the nature of late-17th-century absolutism, biographies of powerful personages, and the global interplay of commerce, imperialism, and war. It all has been an intriguing scholarly experience that has revived and deepened my enthusiasm for historical studies, although the ubiquity of death and the frailty of peace in face of the vanity of kings recalled to mind that a base human condition of violent conflict persisted even in an age that considered itself “enlightened.” War is endlessly confusing. What does it really mean that this or that border was crossed by an army, that fleets were sunk, castle walls toppled, or great cities sacked? In studying war, there is a natural temptation to focus on the spectacular, to recount the great battle upon which history seemed to turn, and to tell tales of great commanders who supposedly turned it. But war is a far deeper phenomenon than battle, with much more elusive causes and effects. Its meaning is entwined in symbiotic relation to changes in religion, culture, politics, and economics. In and of itself, war is usually morally agnostic; it has upheld governing elites whether they were just or despotic, or overthrown them in favor of some other set of masters who had advantages in weapons or tactics, but not better manners or morals. Yet war has moral significance, even if it is often\n\nPreface\n\nxx\n\nunclear as to moral meaning. Somehow, we know that it matters whether civilians are massacred or protected, whether prisoners of war have their throats cut or are ransomed or paroled. It is important that some men and women of conscience over the centuries have tried to limit or end war, even as others with refined consciences supported some wars as necessary (if nonetheless evil) means to longer-term or wider moral goods. It is significant that some artists and poets have celebrated war while others have lamented it, but that mothers only ever fear it. War undresses humanity. Soldiers know better than anyone the murky moral arena in which they live and work. The Duke of Wellington, walking the field of his great victory at Waterloo, mumbled to an aide: “Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won.” Half a century later and a continent away, Confederate General Robert E. Lee spoke a different truth, one far less acceptable in polite modern company but an abiding fact of war nonetheless. It has its own aesthetic, powerful and alluring. On the spectacle and lure of war he said, after repelling a Union charge at Fredericksburg: “It is well that war is so terrible, else we should grow too fond of it.” On the other side of the lines, William T. Sherman recalled the carnage of the American Civil War this way: “War is at best barbarism. . . . Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more destruction. War is hell.” It is also the most expensive, technically complex, and physically, emotionally, and morally demanding enterprise that humans undertake. No art, no music, no cathedral or mosque, no great city, no space program or research into the cure for AIDS or cancer has ever received a fraction of the money, time, and effort that people and societies have regularly put into preparing for and waging war. Those hard truths have shaped my approach to this work and the tone in which it is written. In discussing so vast a range of issues and events, I have relied heavily on hundreds of specialist works by historians of enormously impressive erudition and deep regional historical knowledge. I am immensely grateful to these specialists, upon whose books and articles I have relied in such measure. I have not hesitated to add interpretations of my own in areas I know well, or where it seemed to me that larger patterns in history were readily apparent and broad lessons might be fairly drawn. Yet, writing a reference work of history such as this is primarily an exercise in synthesis. It is simply not possible for one author to master all the primary sources that are the raw ore from which the purer metals of historical truth are smelted. My challenge has been to gain sufficient command of the specialty literature to provide enough detailed narrative that past events become comprehensible, while also communicating the differing interpretations to which those events may be subject. In that, I cleave to the wisdom of G. M. Trevelyan, that in assessing historical actors and events “the really indispensable qualities [are] accuracy and good faith.” Reconstructions of past events and motivations are as accurate as I have been able to make them. I ask readers to accept that I have presented what I believe to be the facts of history and drawn conclusions about the meaning of those facts in scholarly good faith, without conscious bias or preference for the claims of any one party over\n\nPreface\n\nanother. I have, in sum, tried to the limits of my ability as a scholar to present war in the age of Louis XIV as it really was: naked and brutal and raw, as well as complex in motivation and effects. I am content to leave it to readers and critics to determine how well I performed that task. Concerning the comparative length of one entry as against another, it is generally true that the more distantly great events recede from the present the more the history of those events, and the historians who write about them, compress their description. Ideally, that is done because more of the original dross that always conceals the meaning of human affairs has been burned away, and the right conclusions have been drawn about what place in the larger human story a given historical event or person holds. In reality, it probably more closely reflects a common tendency and need to fix all stars in relation to one’s own time and point of view. I have made what effort I can to correct for this baleful habit. As to the length of the overall work, I may only plead in the spirit of Blaise Pascal that I would have written far less, but I did not have the time. Logic of the Work In Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650–1715: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization, I have addressed the complexity of war in this period by including over 1,000 entries that span questions of military technology, war finance, social and class relations, and the evolution of professional standards for the new armies and navies of the post-1650 world. Included are biographies of key military and political figures, from kings, generals, and admirals to designers of fortifications and combat theorists. Of course, as befits a work of military history, most entries are concerned with a narrative recounting of major wars and descriptions of key battles and sieges. This includes explanations of their significance to the wars in which they occurred, and discussion of tactics and weapons employed. Longer battle entries concern fights that revealed an important changing of the guard among disputing powers, or were a turning point in a given war, or have been generally regarded as notable military events by generations of military historians. Some battle or siege entries concern fights from relatively minor wars or fights that were not in themselves decisive, but which nonetheless warranted extended treatment because they exposed some key change in military technology or use of new tactics. Many entries illustrate an opposite but arguably more important truth: that battles were seldom decisive in this period, and that changes in military technology did not usually constitute “revolutions in military affairs.” This work contains entries that explain minutely technical matters, such as the velocity and effect of drag on the range and accuracy of spherical shot or a musket ball, the evolution of drill and advances in military medicine, the adoption of uniforms, and the display and use of flags on land and at sea. There are entries that translate or define specialized period military terminology, others that describe weapons and technical terms and features of fortification, and more which explain naval construction techniques and describe the conduct of operations and new fleet tactics of war at sea. There is extensive discussion of the burden of logistics that so often determined the composition of opposing\n\nxxi\n\nPreface\n\nxxii\n\nforces and decided the strategies pursued. Closely related to logistics were problems of pay and morale, so there are entries here on contributions, mutiny, military discipline, and different systems of war finance and their effects on institutional support for armies and navies. The regional emphasis is heavily European, but not because the author has a personal bias that tugs in this direction. Focusing on European military events and developments is justified by the developing domination of European armies and navies over those of most— though by no means all—other societies and civilizations with which they came into contact. Any global military history must perforce concentrate on European military history in this era because changes and continuities there had a lasting influence nearly everywhere else, whereas the reverse was not true. Also, major areas of world military historical interest during this period became less dynamic. For instance, other than early fighting along coastal Brazil between Portuguese settlers and Dutch invaders, most of South America was quiescent under the “Pax Hispanica.” After China emerged from the chaos of the War of the Three Feudatories (1673–1681), it mostly settled into relative peace and internal stability under a consolidated Qing dynasty, with only occasional forays against much weaker enemies populating most of Inner Asia than was the case in prior centuries. Japan was deeply into its famous “Tokugawa peace” for the years covered in this work, and hence events there hardly appear in these pages. Nevertheless, a concerted effort has been made to cover non-European military history commensurate with its relative importance. Wars and rebellions in India are covered. Extensive material is provided on the Ottoman Empire and Ottoman military. Native American military responses to penetration of the northeast forest and lakes region by competing European empires are treated in their own right, recording their many successes in this era, and not merely the victim-like reactions to inevitable migratory invasions of the continental interior. Analytically, this study starts from the straightforward observation that large states, empires, and civilizations have dominated world affairs for most of recorded history. Even so, smaller states and marginal societies sometimes have been quite influential in the larger course of world history, even if mainly as objects of aggression or imperial competition. Such societies can be interesting and important in their own right, in addition to being of regional significance. Thus, a number of smaller kingdoms are covered, in addition to all major kingdoms and empires. Each is treated in an entry that at the least summarizes the main features of its military position and development, and that tries to situate it in the larger contexts of time and region. It remains true, however, that it was the most powerful kingdoms and empires, the major civilizations from which they arose, and the wars in which they were involved that were the prime movers of world history in this period. Even small changes within certain key societies had a more important and long-term impact on world affairs than signal events within or among smaller countries. Comprehensive coverage is thus given to the policies and interactions of the most powerful kingdoms and empires, and to the dynamics which drove them, including economic, intellectual, political, and social innovation or decay.\n\nPreface\n\nLikewise, it is true that lesser—whether in character or talent—individuals in charge of the affairs of major states had a broad influence on world history. Often, their influence was weightier than that of a moral or intellectual titan, if the latter was confined by chance or birth to a Lilliputian land. Therefore, individuals who might be reasonably judged as of little personal consequence are sometimes given their day in this work, owing to the indisputable public consequences of their choices, actions, or omissions while in command of the public affairs of some major power. More than one otherwise-insignificant pope or prince, king or emperor, or some effete aristocratic general or admiral, has slipped into significant history via this back door, held ajar for them by the pervasive importance of raw power as a motive and moving force in the affairs of the world. Structure of the Work Wars of the Age of Louis XIV is organized alphabetically. Single-word entries are easy and straightforward to locate. It is not always obvious, however, where a compound term should be listed. For ease of use by readers, compound entries are listed as they are employed in normal speech and writing; that is, in the form in which they are most likely to be first encountered by the average reader. If readers are unable to find an entry they seek under one part of a compound term, they should have little difficulty finding it under another component of the term or phrase. Additionally, the book is heavily cross-referenced—all crossreferenced words or terms appear in italics the first time they appear in a given entry. Some license has been taken when cross-referencing adjectives or adverbs to entries that are actually listed as nouns. Readers are advised to make use of this feature, since cross-references almost always provide additional information or insight not contained in the original entry. Rather than clutter the text unduly with italics, common references such as “battle,” or specific weapons or country names, have been left in normal font. Yet, all such commonly used military terms are discussed in discrete entries. In rare cases, some common terms have been highlighted to indicate that they contain additional information that is highly relevant to the entry being perused. To avoid confusion or sending the reader on a fruitless cross-reference search, foreign words and phrases have not been italicized in the text of the main entries (they are, however, italicized in the entry heads, where no such confusion should arise). With only one exception—some rare in-text references to book titles, which are made clear by the context in which they appear—all in-text terms or phrases rendered in italics in an entry indicate a cross-reference. Some technical points: In areas where place names of battles or sieges differ significantly in spelling in several regional languages, I have provided each alternative place name and its language of origin at the start of the main entry. In many cases, blind entries were also added, directing readers to the main entry. This is especially the case concerning Hungarian, Turkish, Greek, and other competing place names in the Balkans. Where battles traditionally have different names for English-language readers as compared to their continental counterparts, I have provided a main entry in the common English form and a blind\n\nxxiii\n\nPreface\n\nentry for the continental counterpart. Thus, “Blenheim” is the main entry for that battle in this book, with a blind entry under “Höchstädt II” to guide readers to the main entry. To avoid confusion as to which Emperor Charles or which King John is the one being referenced in a given instance, I have left Dutch, German, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and most Balkan-language names in their original forms, with blind cross-references provided if it is likely that English-language readers might look elsewhere in the first instance. Thus, in this work, Charles XII of Sweden is rendered as Karl XII, Frederick-William is given as Friedrich-Wilhelm, and so forth. There are rare exceptions to this: Charles VI of Austria is so well known by that name to English-language readers that I have listed his entry under its English spelling, rather than in German as Karl or in Spanish as Carlos III (his claimed title in Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession). For the same reason—familiarity to English-language students of military history—I have listed Ottoman emperors under generally accepted English spellings of Arabic or Turkish personal names. Besides an Introduction that places the military history of the period 1650–1715 into context, Wars of the Age of Louis XIV offers its readers a chronology of major events of the period, a detailed bibliography of important articles and books supplying additional information, and a note on dates that explains clearly the use of and difference between Old Style and New Style dates, the dual usage of which is a feature of this period. Finally, thirteen maps are provided to help put various wars, battles, and types of military fortification into better visual context.\n\nxxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION The conflicts covered in this encyclopedia, Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650–1715, were more complex in forms of military and social organization than the European Wars of Religion that preceded them, the conditions of which are discussed and detailed in my earlier two-volume work, The Age of Wars of Religion, 1000–1650 (Greenwood, 2006). The wars of the era of France’s Louis XIV, the “Sun King,” were also different in key ways from conflicts that followed, which will be dealt with in subsequent volumes in the Greenwood Encyclopedias of Modern World War series. Battles and sieges during the exceptionally long reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715) were marked mostly by indecision, notwithstanding the reputation subsequently accruing to John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, for reintroducing the desire for decisive battle to early 18th-century European warfare. The wars of this age were, like nearly all wars fought since early modern times, decided mainly by attrition leading to economic, political, fiscal, and, in some cases, even moral exhaustion. With few exceptions, military operations were carried out by armies at a pedestrian pace, with clashes occurring at highly predictable locations along well-trodden and heavily fortified frontiers. Initially, armies were unguided by grand strategy or attempts at strategic or operational turning movements. They focused instead on gaining or defending control of key river crossings guarded by great lines of fortresses and garrisoned towns. Military roads, magazines, and other supply systems improved markedly in some countries but remained rudimentary to nonexistent beyond most frontiers, where the majority of fighting actually occurred. That meant, as it had in prior eras and despite strenuous efforts at modernizing reform by absolutist monarchs during this period, that military supply, along with war finance, was not that far advanced beyond the debilitating 16th-century practice of enforcing “contributions” from occupied territories. The success or failure of a campaign also still depended to a high degree on vagaries of weather, while far more casualties resulted from disease than from combat. That was especially the case for unfortunate garrisons in tropical\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxvi\n\noverseas stations, but it was also true within disease-ridden siege camps and crowded and embattled towns in Europe. None of these severe limitations on capability stopped ambitious rulers from seeking strategic direction of military conflicts on a continental and, eventually, a global scale. The expanding scale of operations was a feature that emerged progressively over this period to become something genuinely new, compared to earlier Wars of Religion. Worldwide trade and naval wars strained to maximum degrees the scanty resources and organizational capabilities of still-limited states and overtaxed societies. Grand strategy, once it appeared, also faltered under the strain of battlefield command-and-control limitations that bordered on the merely illusory, in spite of a new and ultimately universal emphasis on hard drill of professional troops. Campaigns and battles seldom decided longterm, worldwide conflicts. As a result, wars among the major powers were most often inconclusive, as well as almost always protracted. As one war named and numbered by later historians ended in a transient treaty marking little more than an exhausted pause, another would begin. Often, only minor shuffling altered the membership of large opposing alliances, as warfare resumed after a mutually agreed break used by each side mainly to recover and rearm. These wars were decided, insofar as they ever were decided, mainly by political and military attrition attended by fiscal and moral exhaustion—or they were interrupted by an accident of royal birth or death leading to a renewed outbreak of diplomacy. The opposite was also true: sustaining peace depended to a high degree on continuing royal health or the survival of some sickly prince or king, most famously—but not uniquely—Carlos II of Spain (r. 1665–1700). Complex issues of succession of Bourbon or Habsburg were the daily stuff of high European politics at all times, and the bane of the lives of masses of peasants swept away by ebbing and waning tides of peace and the maelstrom of war. The first several decades of this period were dominated by three Anglo-Dutch wars and several limited French conflicts provoked by Louis XIV’s dynastic and territorial quarrels with his immediate neighbors. After three decades of commercial competition and active naval warfare, the Dutch and English shifted to a permanent defensive alliance against a wider emerging threat to both from France. A series of Franco-Dutch wars lasting to 1713 thus merged with later, but also serial, Anglo-French wars. Finally, an emerging continental balance of power drew in all the major powers and most minor powers in two great, climactic conflicts that submerged local conflicts even as they marked the outer limits of French power, Louis’ ambitions, and the Grand Alliance’s cohesion: the Nine Years’ War (1688–1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). Although discrete causes may be identified and distinct truces spaced out these many wars, there was real continuity of struggle in Europe, ultimately centered on the ambitions and capabilities of France. The closing decades of the period thus witnessed a generation of war that swirled around the dynastic ambitions and personal convictions of Louis XIV. Great and hostile coalitions drew in every power in western Europe, embroiling overseas colonies of the Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, as well. Wars in other regions of Europe had separate causes, but even distant conflicts accounted for\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe interests of the Sun King at some level, and how these affected local arrangements or alliances. Thus, the Great Northern War (1700–1721) was fought in eastern and northern Europe in tandem with the War of the Spanish Succession, which dominated the affairs of the western half of Europe, but with campaigns, causes, and leading personalities sometimes overlapping. The Great Northern War brought a crashing end to Sweden’s “Stormakstid” century of Great Power ambition and influence, which collapsed in fire and blood as Sweden was forcibly expelled from the Great Power ranks by its decisive defeat, and whole provinces of its empire in Germany and the Baltic were ripped away by rival powers. Sweden sank thereafter to the second tier, a mere Baltic power akin to Denmark. The Polish Commonwealth also ended the period much diminished in power, prestige, and territorial possessions. A high price was paid even by some of the victorious states upon the return of peace. Much of the strength of the United Provinces was drained by the long effort to defend against Louis and the loss of preeminence in global trade to its ally, Great Britain. The United Provinces entered a slow decline from Great Power status into a protracted period of self-doubt and, in later decades, of chronic fear and consequent appeasement of its larger neighbors. Spain, already markedly in decline by 1650, at the close of the 17th century was invaded, occupied, and fought over by several foreign armies. Its once-extensive European empire was divided among the other powers at the end of the great war over the Spanish succession. Madrid’s precipitous decline from being the preeminent Great Power in Europe and the world’s first global empire would continue during the 18th century under the Bourbons. Spain would yet see periods of real recovery and even brief strength outside Europe, but overall Spain moved under the wing of France and remained there for 100 years. On the other hand, Austria emerged from the French wars, and even more so from a protracted war with the Ottoman Empire, with a greatly expanded territorial empire of its own along the Danube, although in Germany its reach still far exceeded its actual grasp. The effort to remain important, if no longer dominant, deep into Germany and across the Holy Roman Empire strained Austrian resources and prestige for decades to come. Outside Europe, the Ottomans—in striking contrast to the Austrian Habsburgs—reached the limits of imperial ambition before the walls of Vienna in 1683. They then entered a long period of slow, but also unrelieved, relative military decline. The Mughals faced growing Hindu and Sikh resistance to their overlordship in northern India, with violence and rebellion provoked in good measure by a foolhardy new policy of radical religious intolerance under the Muslim zealot Aurangzeb. By the end of the period, the Mughal Empire faced revolt and civil war, even as European powers began to penetrate deeper into the Indian subcontinent from their various enclaves on the coast. China went through the final conquest of Ming resistance to a Qing invasion dating to the first half of the 17th century, and then suffered a vast civil and dynastic conflict known as the War of the Three Feudatories (1673–1681). However, once that war ended, China enjoyed relative peace under the powerful protection of its Banner system armies. Qing emperors fought isolated campaigns to consolidate\n\nxxvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxviii\n\ninternal control and secure the frontiers, including genocidally against the Zunghar Mongols during the 18th century, but otherwise settled down to enjoy the ripe fruit of their historic conquest of one of the truly great civilizations of world history. Throughout this period, Japan ceased to be militarily active. Coming after a millennium of samurai wars and a full century of utter chaos from 1467 to 1568, known as the “Sengoku jidai,” or “Country at War” or “Warring States” era, and then a decade of murderous aggression against Korea and violent internal repression of the Kirishitan, the change was one of the most remarkable in all recorded history. Thus, during this period Japan was in the first century of what would be 250 years of peace and radical isolationism under the Tokugawa shoguns. But as intrinsically interesting as these varied developments in India, China, and Japan were, none left a lasting mark on world military history. Instead, smaller European powers emerged in this period and would later be ascendant militarily in ways that deeply affected global history, although in contemporary comparison to the Mughal or Qing Empires in India and China, they were still bit players on the world stage. Brandenburg-Prussia gained much territory and more prestige from a fairly judicious and limited military involvement, and more because its regional enemies—Denmark, Poland, and Sweden—were all significant losers of land and prestige by 1715. Meanwhile, England and Scotland emerged from the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651) and another four decades of civil and constitutional conflict to finally complete the union of their shared island in 1707. As the new United Kingdom of Great Britain, an increasingly confident and aggressive British nation was fully engaged in the great war under way on the continent, even as it embarked on what would become a century of overseas colonial settlement and expansion, and the successful protection of its monopoly global trades. Great Britain thus emerged as one of the major victors of the wars of the Age of Louis XIV. It enjoyed rising wealth and power over the following decades, during which it would further indulge the vast geopolitical and commercial ambitions of its new governing classes by deploying self-conscious national naval power in support of exclusionary trade policies that were to its great economic benefit. The most important permanent geopolitical change occurring over this period was that Russia left the isolationist traditions of old Muscovy behind and joined the European state system. And it did so not merely as a newly active member, but as one of the vital Great Powers. Russia self-consciously and formally took the place of Sweden, which it had crushed by the end of the Great Northern War in 1721. And what of France? In 1713, the continental ambitions of Louis XIV were contained by a clear European balance of power. In a series of treaties, the longcontentious frontiers of France were henceforth defined as internationally acknowledged and delimited borders. France closed the “grand siècle” with Louis XIV on his deathbed, a chastened and perhaps repentant warlord. Domestically, the ancient contest of wills between the monarchy and nobility, with the latter seeking a revival of ancient rights of regional parlements to participate in governance, remained unresolved through the 18th century, despite the lifelong\n\nIntroduction\n\neffort of Louis XIV to concentrate all power in the hands of the monarch at Versailles. In foreign affairs, the 18th century would see French power slip further within Europe vis-á-vis Russia, Prussia, and even Austria. Overseas, real losses would come with a parade of defeats that saw France lose the maritime contest with Great Britain by 1763, along with its possessions in North America and nearly all of India, and control of key trade routes to Southeast Asia and North Asia. Yet even after those substantial losses of a once-mighty overseas empire, France was still primus inter pares among the Great Powers of Europe, new and old alike. It would remain so through more decades of global war and a quarter-century of revolution and extraordinarily aggressive expansion that in retrospect might make decades of warmongering by Louis XIV look pale, to some, in comparison.\n\nxxix\n\nNOTE ON DATES During the late 16th century, a number of countries in Europe shifted to the “Gregorian” calendar proclaimed by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. By that year, the old “Julian” calendar (named for Julius Caesar) was fourteen days out of time with the solar year, using the Council of Nicaea in 325 C.E. as the benchmark. Gregory made a ten-day correction using the Vernal Equinox as marker. Thus, the day following October 4, 1582, in the Papal States was not October 5 but October 15, 1582. Gregory also declared the New Year as commencing on January 1. Despite not fully correcting the errors of the Julian system, Gregory’s calendar promised much greater accuracy. Even so, no self-respecting Protestant would take guidance from a pope on a matter (time) that rightfully belonged to God. Hence, only Catholic countries shifted to the Gregorian, or “New Style” (NS) calendar. Austria and most Catholic states in Germany, along with France, Portugal, and Spain, adopted New Style. Protestant powers cleaved to the Julian, or “Old Style” (OS) method. That meant that dates in Protestant countries and histories were ten days behind Catholic dates until 1700, and eleven days behind after that. Orthodox Russia declined to concede that anyone in the Latin world might have a point about how best to keep God’s time. Russians remained staunchly committed to the increasingly inaccurate Julian calendar to the end of the Tsarist regime in the early 20th century, falling further behind NS with each passing century. Once the fires of religious conflict in western Europe burned out by the end of the 17th century, some Protestants were prepared to admit the greater logic and accuracy of the Gregorian calendar. Saxony shifted to NS Style in 1697. Other Protestant states in Germany followed suit in 1699. Sweden adopted NS from 1700, but reverted to OS in 1712. That meant that the same events involving Sweden during a twelve-year period were recorded in different sources as taking place on three separate dates. Thus, the Battle of Poltava in 1709 took place on June 27 (OS) for Protestant contemporaries, but on June 28 (Swedish-style) for Swedes, and on July 8 (NS) for nearly all Catholics, German Protestants, and\n\nNote on Dates\n\nxxxii\n\nmost historians. Great Britain made the change to NS only in 1752. Thus, while the Battle of the Boyne is today commemorated in Northern Ireland on July 12, immediately after 1753 it was dated to July 11, while in OS it was fought on July 1. A further complication is that in Great Britain and its colonies, the New Year was dated to March 25 through 1751, meaning that many events were recorded as taking place not just on different days, but in different years. For instance, a treaty’s date might be recorded by a more fastidious English historian as “February 24, 1713/March 7, 1714.” A last complication arises from the independence of mind—and of all things English—that is still typical of Scots; histories of Scotland date the New Year in that northern country from January 1, 1600. In 1753, Sweden decided that the Catholic world had been right all along and relapsed into NS. Western European empires imposed NS, and European and Christian dating systems more generally, on the vast and various peoples of the colonial world they conquered over the course of the 16th–19th centuries. Orthodox Russia stayed true to OS until the Bolsheviks—rough reformers of everything they could conceive of or lay hands on—forced Russians and other subjects of the Orthodox tsars not only to shift to NS in 1918, but to apply the calendar retroactively. Thus January 31, 1918, became February 14, 1918, forever confusing casual students of history as to whether the Russian Revolutions of the previous year took place in February and October or March and November. Orthodox peoples elsewhere, such as in Greece or within the Ottoman Empire, resisted changing to New Style until 1923. As part of a hurried, imitative modernization under the restored Meiji Emperor, the Japanese enthusiastically adopted NS in 1873. Imperial Chinese bureaucrats insisted on retaining Confucian ways of recording time, just as they clung conservatively to all things traditional in the face of sweeping changes then being forced upon China by the outside world. The successors to China’s emperors and scholar-bureaucrats were more impatient of the old ways. Modernizing republicans looked to the West for new models of national development and symbols of progress, and thus imposed NS on the Chinese in 1912. Muslim societies followed the Islamic (lunar) calendar established in 639 by Caliph Umar I. This dated “Year One” to the start of the Hegira (flight of the Prophet) in 622, and set the Muslim New Year as the equivalent of July 16 in the Latin calendar. Western scholars designated this Muslim system “Anno Hegirae” (A.H.) for “In the year of the Hegira.” Further complicating matters, the Muslim year is only 354 days long. An eleven-day difference from the Western year comes about because the Muslim calendar is divided into twelve lunar cycles of equal length, beginning with each crescent moon (which thereafter became the main symbol that celebrated and proclaimed Islam). While this system removes the need to add leap days or leap years, it means that the Hegira calendar moves through the solar year, and that it takes 34 solar years for a lunar month to repeat exactly in the same season. As contact with the West rather than other Muslim powers became the major political concern of the Ottoman Empire, it introduced an Islamicized solar calendar, but one which still ran thirteen days behind the Gregorian calendar. After their defeat in World War I, as part of a radical postwar modernization program, the Turks adopted the Western calendar (just\n\nNote on Dates\n\nas they later shifted from Arabic to Latin script). While some stricter Muslim societies refused to make the change, most Islamic countries eventually adopted what had become a common international calendar through colonial inheritance, for appearances of modernization, or just for commercial convenience. Everywhere in the Muslim world, however, the Hegira system remains in use to determine holy days of special religious obligation and observance. Wherever possible in this encyclopedia—and unless otherwise indicated— Hegira, Orthodox, and Ottoman dates have been translated into NS, starting the new year on January 1. However, in a number of cases where the wider and older historical literature is inconsistent and might be confusing to readers, this work provides both OS and NS dates.\n\nxxxiii\n\nTrarbach\n\nMainz\n\nBingen Kreuznach\n\nah e\n\ne Sur\n\nTrier\n\nN\n\nWorms\n\nLuxembourg\n\nSarrebourg\n\nMannheim Frankental Kaisersloutern Neustadt\n\nle\n\nos\n\nel\n\nHerdelberg c Ne\n\nM\n\nSpeyer\n\nka\n\nSinzheim\n\nSarrelouis Saarbrücken\n\nPhilippsburg Gemersheim\n\nr\n\nLa\n\nHeilbrom\n\nr ute\n\nMetz Sa\n\nWissenbourg\n\nrre\n\nEttlingen Lauterbourg\n\nMo\n\nder\n\nHaguenau\n\nRastatt\n\nLouis\n\nStuttgart Stollhofen\n\nNancy Altenheim Kehl Salzbach Willstätt Offenburg\n\nStrasbourg Molsheim\n\ncka Ne\n\nr\n\nRh\n\nin\n\ne\n\nEnsheim\n\nRottweil\n\nTurkheim Breisach\n\nVillingen e\n\nColmar\n\nDanub\n\nTuttlingen\n\nN\n\nLake Constance\n\nMulhouse Belfort\n\nConstance Huningue Basle\n\nTurenne’s German Campaigns, 1674–75\n\nRheinfeld\n\nTurenne’s First campaign, 1674 Turenne’s Second campaign, 1674 Turenne’s Third campaign, 1674 Turenne’s Fourth (Winter) campaign, 1674–75\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50 km\n\n50 miles\n\nxxxv\n\n30°\n\n20°\n\n10°\n\nKINGDOM OF SWEDE N\n\n40°\n\nFINLAND\n\nNORWAY\n\nHelsingfors Gulf\n\nStockholm\n\nFrederikshald 1718\n\nSt Petersburg\n\nland INGRIA\n\nof Fin\n\nNarva 1700\n\nESTONIA\n\n1700 1701 1700\n\nDENMARK\n\nRiga\n\n1716– 1718\n\nR U S S I A\n\nLIVONIA\n\n1702 Balt ic Sea\n\nCopenhagen 1700\n\nSmolensk 1708 1708\n\nSWEDISH POMERANIA\n\nPRUSSIA Grodno 1708 P\n\nHOLSTEIN\n\n1703\n\nO LAND\n\nStettin BRANDENBURG\n\nWarsaw\n\nUKRAINE\n\n1706\n\n1705\n\n1707\n\n1704\n\nSAXONY\n\nPoltava 1709\n\nCracow\n\n40°\n\n9\n\n1702\n\nKarl’ s flig ht 17 0\n\n1715\n\nLemberg\n\nube\n\nDan\n\nVienna AUSTRIA\n\n1714\n\nHUNGARY Kar l’s s ecr et r\n\nCRIMEA out\n\ne, 1\n\n714\n\nN\n\nube\n\nDan\n\nOTTO M AN EMP IRE Campaigns of Karl XII of Sweden\n\n30°\n\nCampaign of 1700\n\nCampaign of 1707\n\nCampaigns of 1701–02\n\nCampaign of 1708\n\nCampaign of 1703\n\nKarl’s route 1714–15\n\nCampaign of 1704\n\nCampaigns of 1716–18\n\n1709– 1714 Demotika\n\n0\n\nB lac k Se a\n\nConstantinople\n\n50 km\n\nCampaigns of 1705–06 0\n\nxxxvi\n\n50 miles\n\n250 km\n\n0\n\nFrance vs. the United Provinces French invasion of the United Provinces, 1672\n\n0\n\n250 miles\n\nDENMARK\n\nWilliam’s invasion of England, 1688 Territory annexed by Louis XIV, 1648–84\n\nNo r th S ea\n\nTerritory claimed by France, 1684–97\n\nUNITED PROVINCES\n\nE NGL A ND\n\nAmsterdam\n\nLondon\n\nThe Hague FLANDERS u\n\nTorbay\n\nMe\n\nl\n\nCologne\n\nCaptured from Spain 1659\n\nROMAN\n\ne\n\nLUXEMBOURG Occupied 1684\n\nEMPIRE\n\nLORRAINE\n\nSeine\n\nParis\n\nNantes\n\nStrasbourg Occupied 1681\n\nALS\n\nire\n\nOccupied 1684–70\n\nACE\n\nMetz\n\nBU RG UN DY\n\nLo\n\nH O LY\n\nin\n\nC\n\nne\n\nse\n\nRh\n\nEn\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN\n\nh glis\n\nn ha\n\nSPANISH NETH.

A field obstacle made from a felled tree laid lengthwise, with sharpened branches facing the enemy. Iron spikes were sometimes used as well. During siege operations abatis protected miners and sappers, as well as musketeers and siege cannon and their crews. Defenders sometimes used abatis as an interior line of defense or to reinforce a breach in a fortified position. See also chevaux des frise; Spanish riders; Sweinfedder. absolutism. A political condition in which all power theoretically rested in the hands of the monarch, acting in the interest of an arbitrary and absolute state. Although some 17th–18th century kings claimed broad powers, all were constrained to some degree by traditional systems of governance and hereditary rights of the aristocracy and clergy. This was more true of Louis XIV and his successors in France than earlier scholarship sometimes understood. The trend also clearly marked the governing system of the Habsburgs and was true even for the supreme autocrat in Russia, Peter I. Absolutism was the political support of semifeudal agrarian societies where a king’s revenues and armies alike relied mainly on taxation of, and forced recruitment among, a servile peasantry. Absolutism should not be confused with a more general European trend toward greater centralization of military, financial, and political power, including co-opting nobilities through compulsory state service (as in Prussia and Russia) or by issuing various offices, titles, and bribes to once proudly independent aristocrats or rising members of the bourgeoisie eager for acceptance into a higher social class (as in France). It also should be recalled that in England and the United Provinces the trend was in the opposite direction, toward expanding powers of representative assemblies at the expense of increasingly limited monarchs, or even deposition of monarchs in favor of erection of republics. In England, the Stuarts were twice thrown from power, Parliament gained sovereign authority, and religious toleration was extended during this period to all but Catholics. See also Aurangzeb (1618–1707); Brandenburg; Charles II of England\n\nAcadia\n\n(1630–1685); Denmark; Friedrich I in Prussia (1657–1713); Friedrich-Wilhelm of Brandenburg (1620–1688); James II (1633–1701); mandate of heaven; mercantilism. Acadia. A former French colony spanning much of the maritimes of eastern Canada and parts of Maine. The first French colonists arrived in 1604. Its capital was the small fortified town of Port Royal. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) the British mounted an expedition against Port Royal. The fort and town fell on September 14/25, 1710. Great Britain was awarded permanent control of the colony of Acadia in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Act of Succession (1701). When it became clear that neither William III nor Queen Anne would leave behind a Protestant Stuart heir upon their respective deaths, and with descendants of the deposed Catholic sovereign James II already fomenting Jacobite plots and unrest, Great Britain might have faced another violent succession crisis upon Queen Anne’s eventual death. Anticipating this, Parliament pre-empted any crisis by passing an Act of Succession naming the Elector of Hanover as rightful heir. He subsequently ascended the throne as George I (r. 1714–1727). The Act of Succession signified the permanent end of the religious civil wars on the island and confirmed the Glorious Revolution, by ensuring that a falling crown landed on the head of a Protestant monarch already approved by Parliament. Act of Union (March 4/15, 1707). This Act of Parliament joined Scotland to England in a “United Kingdom,” also abolishing the Scottish parliament and naming the combined country Great Britain. This completed a constitutional process begun with union of the English and Scottish crowns in 1603. The 1707 Act provided for England to pay Scotland’s large debt, while also establishing free trade within Great Britain. admiral. See ranks (at sea). Admiral of France (Amiral de France). See ranks (at sea). Admiralty. The key naval institution exercising oversight of the Royal Navy, especially following passage of the “Admiralty Act” in 1690. The Dutch Navy had five admiralties, one each for Amsterdam, Holland, Friesland, the Maze (Rotterdam), and Zeeland. See impressment. Adrianople, Peace of (July 1713).

A peace treaty between France and Spain ending the War of Devolution (1667–1668). It was directly prompted by\n\nAlmanza, Battle of\n\nformation of the anti-French Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the United Provinces. It permitted Louis XIV to begin preparations for a war of revenge against the United Provinces: the Dutch War (1672–1678). The treaty compelled Louis to give up Franche-Comté, while permitting him to dismantle its lines and fortifications, laying the province open to easy reoccupation at a future time of his choosing. Madrid conceded several key towns in the Spanish Netherlands which had fallen to French sieges in the opening campaign of 1667: Oudenarde, Tournai, and Lille. The status of this settlement and all the territories it governed was challenged within four years by renewed fighting, when Louis launched the Dutch War (1672–1678) by attacking the United Provinces. Albemarle, Duke of. See Monk (Monck), George (1608–1670). Alexis (1629–1676). Tsar of Russia (r. 1645–1676). Alexis was the second Romanov to occupy the throne, succeeding his father Michael. He was a moderate “Westernizer” rather than a “Slavophile.” He thus encouraged trade with, and some cultural opening toward, the West. But this initiative had little success beyond his immediate court. His efforts to modernize the state bureaucracy and Army saw even less success. His military reforms faced stiff opposition from the strel’sty, while royal patronage of religious reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon (1605–1681) riled larger segments of the population, again including the strel’sty. Compounding his perceived assault on peasant (and some boyar) religious belief, Alexis oversaw enserfment of additional numbers of peasants. This tension culminated in his suppression of the great rebellion led by Stenka Razin in 1670–1671. In foreign policy, most of his reign was preoccupied with the Khmelnitsky Uprising (1648–1654) and Thirteen Years’ War (1654–1667), and attendant negotiations with the Polish Commonwealth. Algiers. Algiers and its hinterland were ruled by local deys in the name of the Ottoman Empire. The city was bombarded by French bomb ketches twice in 1682 and again in 1683 and 1688. The first attempt failed because the French anchored too far from shore during night operations, then were forced to retreat with daylight. The second effort was savagely successful, as was the third. See Barbary corsairs. Almanza, Battle of (April 14/25, 1707). The decisive battle in Iberia fought during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). A Franco-Spanish army of 21,000 under Berwick faced just 16,000 Allied troops (mainly British and Portuguese, but also French Huguenots) under the Earl of Galway. There is some disagreement about those numbers, but none about the outcome of the fight: it was short and sharp, lasting barely two hours, and was won by the French cavalry. While a Spanish cavalry assault faltered on the Allied left, French cavalry broke Galway’s line on the Portuguese right, then rolled it up so that the Redcoats started to run as well. French cavalry then joined Spanish horse in cutting down thousands of enemy infantry during a hot and bloody pursuit. The Bourbon allies together killed or wounded 4,000 Allied troops and took 3,000 more\n\n3\n\nAlmenara, Battle of\n\nprisoner, while widely scattering the survivors from wholly shattered enemy formations.

See War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). Alsace. Alsace was partially annexed to France in 1648 as part of the spoils of victory in the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648). However, many towns in Alsace continued to regard themselves as subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor. During the Dutch War (1672–1678), Louis XIV personally led an occupying force to repress this lingering Imperial sentiment in Alsace, which had emerged strongly once Louis took France to war with the German emperor, Leopold I of Austria. Alsatians lent material and moral aid to Imperial troops against the French throughout the Dutch War. Important Alsatian towns were intimidated by French military occupation and rough billeting, until they declared loyalty to Louis XIV, in the run-up to the War of the Reunions (1683–1684). Religious liberty in Alsace was guaranteed under the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and thus was not overridden by Louis’ Edict of Fontainebleau (October 22, 1685). alti bölük sipahileri. Six richly paid regiments of sipahis who served as the standing cavalry of the Ottoman sultans. They were resident at the Porte. Many held noncombat posts in the military administration (“divanî hizmet”). Altona, Treaty of (July 10/20, 1689). This agreement between Denmark and Sweden was mediated by England and Brandenburg. It compelled Denmark to surrender Schleswig to Sweden. It was the basis for early support by the Maritime Powers for Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), in exchange for which Sweden promised to uphold the Treaty of Ryswick (September 20, 1697).

The Dutch conducted or threatened amphibious operations along the French Atlantic coast during the Dutch War (1672–1678), including at Bayonne, Belle Île, Dieppe, Harfleur, and Poitou. Stretched by campaigns in the Spanish Netherlands, Germany, and the Mediterranean, the French responded by calling a local arrière-ban in Brittany and Normandy.

Andrussovo, Treaty of (January 30/February 9, 1667). After a prolonged conflict between Russia and Poland for possession of the Ukraine in the Thirteen Years’ War (1654–1667), this treaty was born of mutual exhaustion. By its terms, Russia obtained Smolensk and its hinterland and eastern Ukraine, including Kiev, for an initially agreed period of two years. Muscovite Russia took that part of Ukraine lying along the left bank of the Dnieper, while Poland retained all Ukrainian territory on the right bank. Andrussovo was of strategic importance not merely for its contribution to containment of Sweden and further reduction of Polish power relative to its neighbors, but because the deal pushed a growing and progressively more aggressive Russian state a little closer to conflict with the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus and Balkans. The Andrussovo settlement was disputed by Poland for another 20 years but was ratified in a second treaty, the “Eternal Peace” of 1686, that made the terms of settlement permanent. Andrussovo thereby helped keep peace in the region until the start of the Great Northern War (1700–1721). One area of mutual concern which Andrussovo did not resolve, though Poles and Russians alike thought it had, was the “Cossack problem.” This was mainly because the Cossacks were in great social, religious, and political ferment and a 30-year-long civil war. In addition, after Andrussovo the Polish Commonwealth was too internally weak to restore control over its portion of partitioned Ukraine. See also Austro-Ottoman War, First (1683–1699); Cossacks. Angelets rebellion (1669–1672). A tax revolt by French peasants in the eastern Pyrenees provoked by the reforms and policies of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, especially enforcement of the salt tax (“gabelle”). Guerilla warfare lasted four years. The fighting convinced Louis XIV to build extensive defenses around Villefranche, which oversaw the key pass leading to the plain of Roussillon. Anglo-Dutch Brigade. Three English and Scots regiments served with the Dutch in defense of the United Provinces and Protestantism on the continent since 1585. From 1674 these regiments were amalgamated in the “Anglo-Dutch Brigade.” They were subsumed into William III’s unified Army in 1689. See also British Army; Dutch War (1672–1678); officers. Anglo-Dutch Naval Agreement (1689). Signed as part of the diplomatic revolution and shift in the European balance of power that accompanied the Glorious Revolution, this treaty stipulated that in future allied naval actions the ratio\n\n5\n\nAnglo-Dutch Treaty\n\nof ships provided would be five British men-of-war for every three Dutch battleships. This codified what was already a growing gap in naval power between England and the United Provinces, with the latter finally accepting second-tier status after a half-century of naval and commercial competition. Anglo-Dutch Treaty (October 1709). See Barrier Treaty, First (October 18/29, 1709)\n\n6\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, First (1652–1654). The underlying economic cause of the Anglo-Dutch wars that lasted from 1652 until 1674 was long-term decline, dating to 1621, of English trade in the Baltic with northern Germany, Russia, and Sweden. Dutch trade with these regions had grown commensurately. On the other hand, English merchants had cut deeply into Dutch maritime commerce with southern Europe and the Levant after 1630, partly under the influence of a Spanish wartime embargo of trade with the United Provinces. As the Eighty Years’ War (1568–1648) with Spain drew to a close, during the 1640s the Dutch began to recover southern trade because of their larger merchant marine, lower transport rates, and better and more trustworthy finances. They were further aided in recovery by the fact that England’s commercial and naval shipping was drawn into the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651). This shift in the commercial balance severely affected the interests of the great merchants of London, principal beneficiaries of the English revolution of the late 1640s and the newly dominant political power on the island of Great Britain. By 1651 the economic slump in England was so deep that radical legislation was introduced to correct the trade imbalance. Passage by the English Parliament of the first Navigation Act (1651) was a major irritant in Anglo-Dutch relations, but did not of itself threaten the Dutch trading system, in which English trade was but a small part. The proximate cause of the war was English insistence on visit and search, and most often also seizure, of Dutch merchantmen in the Channel and Baltic Sea to enforce the new maritime law passed by Parliament. More provocative still was the scale of the chronic assault on Dutch commerce by English privateers, exacerbated by a common practice of these brutal men of torturing captured crews. During 1651, over 140 Dutch merchantmen were seized by English warships or privateers, with 30 more taken during the month of January 1652. Given the position of the Channel as a natural choke point for Dutch world commerce, nothing less than world trade primacy and the core prosperity of the United Provinces was at stake. Conflict over diverging economic interests was inflamed by religious and political factors, especially the fanatically self-righteous assumptions of the most millenarian supporters of Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan government. English radicals wanted to join with the United Provinces in a single Republic devoted to the “one true faith” so that their combined militaries might oppose France and any other country devoted to the other one. This was anomalous, given that the rest of Europe had just exited the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and the long era of wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants more generally. Dutch rejection of any joint crusade against Catholic Europe was nevertheless seen by\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, First\n\nthe new religious power and personages in England as impious, not just impolitic. In essence, England was demanding political subordination by the United Provinces, an improbable request given that the Dutch had waged war for over eight decades to free themselves of the “Spanish yoke.” The States’ Navy (as the once-and-future Royal Navy was called by the Puritan Republic) and the Dutch Navy were thus destined to clash in the first of three naval and trade wars. These conflicts altered the politics of northern Europe and reshaped the policies of England and the Netherlands toward each other in ways that affected much of the world for the next century. Reacting to English provocations at sea, in 1651 the States General of the United Provinces finally moved to reverse years of naval neglect and voted funds to raise the number of Dutch warships to 226, including many larger types, from an extant complement of just 76 smaller vessels. England’s governing power interpreted this as Dutch provocation and formal war broke out, declared by England on July 8, 1652. It had started before then, in fact, when traditional English insistence on being saluted by all ships traveling through “British seas” (based on the vague and unenforceable medieval claim of “sovereignty of the sea”) was defied by a Dutch fleet on May 2/12, 1652. Maarten van Tromp was sent into the Narrow Seas to back up Dutch defiance. He also refused to give the salute demanded by English captains when, with 42 Dutch warships, he encountered Robert Blake at the head of just 12 English sail. The unequal sides exchanged mostly harmless fire in the so-called “Battle of Dover,” a minor scuffle off Folkestone on May 19/29, 1652. Nevertheless, this skirmish provoked the wider Anglo-Dutch war that each side had long expected. In mid-July Tromp reappeared off The Downs with 100 warships. After losing half this fleet to a great gale (damaged ships repaired for their home ports), he took several large East Indiamen as prizes, cutting them out of a passing convoy. Then he sailed for home. In August there was a fight off Plymouth between de Ruyter and Ayscue: the opposing fleets passing in uncouth order through each other’s lines, thereafter dissolving into a mêlée that led to some loss of life but no lost ships. The first significant fight came at Kentish Knock (September 28/ October 8, 1652). It demonstrated that English ships and crews were markedly superior in fighting ability and morale to the Dutch. Tromp with 80 warships escorted a large convoy down the Channel in late November, but was intercepted by Blake with 52 sail. The fleets fought off Dungeness (November 30/ December 10, 1652). Tromp prevailed, clearing the Channel for the convoy. Parliament was dismayed and it, rather than Tromp as legend has it, used a new broom to sweep away defeated English captains. Parliament voted new money for the Navy, but tied this to a code of discipline to supposedly discourage the “cowardice” displayed hitherto. When Tromp returned to the Channel in escort of a new convoy he was met by Blake. The battlefleets fought the “Three Days’ Battle” off Portland (February 18–20/February 28–March 2, 1653); Blake was wounded in the fighting off Beachy Head. Meanwhile, the United Provinces and Denmark agreed to a treaty closing most Baltic trade to English merchants and blocking English importation of key naval stores (masts, hemp) available only from the Baltic. After a lull in contact, the battlefleets met again at the Gabbard Shoal (June 2–3/12–13, 1653), where the Dutch were routed. The English\n\n7\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, First\n\n8\n\nfollowed up their victory with a blockade of the coast of the United Provinces, but they did not have the ships or logistical capabilities to sustain it long enough to be fully effective. In late July, Tromp evaded a second attempt at blockade, this time conducted by George Monk, and instead successfully joined the divided halves of the Dutch fleet. The two opposing battlefleets met and fought at the Texel (July 31/August 10, 1653). The Dutch partly made up for fleet action losses in the Channel and North sea by effective cruiser warfare further afield, by their own Zeeland privateers cutting out English merchantmen, and by outright defeat of an isolated English squadron which was inadvisedly sent to the Mediterranean earlier in the war. Clearing that southern sea of English warships was trumped by a northern combination with Denmark to totally close the Baltic Sea to English trade—not one English ship made it through the Sound in 1653. More important even than lost trade was the Danish-Dutch denial of English access to critical naval supplies obtainable only from Baltic exporters, especially hemp. There were also sharp naval successes won by VOC ships in far distant waters, from the Persian Gulf to the China Sea. English privateers also enjoyed successes against the Dutch, taking over 1,000 prizes over the course of the war. These losses went some way to matching damage done to English sea power and to providing mounting commercial pressure on the Dutch. In combination with growing naval losses on either side, domestic events in both republics conspired to end the war. A coup d’état on April 20/30, 1653, by Oliver Cromwell and the Army in England initially brought naval crusaders against the Dutch to power in London. But a naval mutiny by unpaid seamen at Chatham that October forced Cromwell to broaden his political base by reining in the most fanatic of his Puritan supporters. He established himself as “Lord Protector” in December 1653, and looked to make peace with the United Provinces. This chain of events was matched by general republican, and by specific Regents of Holland, opposition to wartime political advances by the House of Orange within the United Provinces, and to riots in many Dutch cities provoked by ship and crew losses, and rising unemployment among seamen and in the fisheries. The United Provinces had lost dozens of warships and hundreds of merchantmen (up to 1,200 total ships lost, if large sea-going fishing vessels are included). The economy thus went into a deep and protracted slump, with the herring fishery especially badly damaged and overseas trade and profits sharply reduced. Dutch shipping was so limited by the war with England that in 1654, in far away “Netherlands Brazil,” local Portuguese militia finally were able to expel Dutch invaders-cum-settlers, now cut off from their homeland. Survivors were driven into Surinam. Nationalist sentiment in the United Provinces increasingly coalesced around the political hopes of the House of Orange, as De Witt and the other Regents were blamed for great naval defeats suffered in the Channel and North Sea, but not wholly credited with less spectacular—but strategically more crucial—Dutch gains in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and East Indies: gains so great that only with Portugal did England hold onto its prewar levels of trade. The war thus ended without victory or victor, a condition of merely suspended hostility that was quickly codified in the Treaty of Westminster (April 12/22, 1654).\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, Second\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, Second (1665–1667). The United Provinces emerged from the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654) still the dominant naval power in the Baltic and Mediterranean, but badly damaged in the North Sea, and with its fish trade and fisheries in near-ruin. Further afield the Dutch had successfully fended off England’s bid for commercial primacy, including making inroads in the Atlantic slave trade with Spanish America and the spice trades from Ceylon, India, and the Far East. Events in England following the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 initially looked to favor the United Provinces. An Anglo-Dutch alliance was signed in September 1662, but there was much opposition to ratification in both signing countries. Fighting in the Second Anglo-Dutch War actually began in early 1664, a year before the “official” start date. The trigger was an English expedition to West Africa in late 1663, during which Admiral Robert Holmes took the opportunity to smash Dutch slave shipping and pound Dutch defenses. The underlying cause of the war was continuing global competition for trade in multiple commodities, from slaves and gold taken to the West Indies and Spanish America from West Africa, to the rich fishing trade of the Baltic and North Atlantic, to the carriage trade from the Levant and Spain, to the spices and fabrics of India and beyond. Once again, the predations of English privateers further provoked the Dutch to war. Before the formal declaration of war issued by Charles II on February 22/March 4, 1665, over 200 Dutch ships had already been taken by the English, and several Dutch colonies had also fallen, including Essequebo, New Netherland (Nieuw Nederland, including Nieuw Amsterdam), Pomeroon, Saba, and St. Eustatius. The Second Anglo-Dutch War was more farranging than the First, with raids and naval engagements carried out along the coasts of Africa, the Caribbean, North and South America, and South Asia. There were small land battles fought far afield as well, in the eastern Netherlands and in India. All the while, danger of war with France loomed over England and the United Provinces alike, as Louis XIV maneuvered diplomatic pawns and readied for combat his powerful military rooks. In May 1664, Dutch troops attacked Münsterland. Defects in the Dutch Army caused by mismanagement by the States of Holland quickly showed: the princebishop of Münster, Christoph Bernhard, counterattacked with 20,000 men, driving the Dutch out in great disarray and occupying several eastern Dutch towns. Parts of the United Provinces neared panic that was not allayed until French auxiliaries arrived and English subsidies to the prince-bishop evaporated, causing the Münsterite army to withdraw. The Dutch Navy was more ready for war than it had been in 1652, but once more it suffered great structural disadvantages vis-à-vis the Royal Navy in its windward location, lower ship numbers, lighter and fewer ship-borne guns, and deeply politically divided officer corps and crews. The opening fleet action took place at Lowestoft (June 3/13, 1665), where a large Dutch fleet was predictably overmatched by English ships superior in draft and design and sporting heavier guns. Dutch naval morale fell along with plunging prices on the Amsterdam Exchange. Neither recovered until great ships of the East India fleet arrived in home waters after sailing around Ireland to evade the Royal Navy. The United Provinces grew more genuinely unified, even while discovering the latent fighting capacity of the Dutch\n\n9\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, Second\n\n10\n\nrepublic, which proved superior to all monarchies of the day. This power was notably revealed by improved recruitment and morale, which rose in all the provinces and not just in Holland as military wages improved and outlays of state money and mercantile commitments far exceeded anything possible in the other states of Europe, or indeed anywhere in the world. By early 1666 the strategic situation of the United Provinces dramatically improved: Münster had been repulsed, and France now intervened in a limited fashion on the Dutch side, declaring war on England on January 16/26, 1666. Neutral opinion also was decidedly pro-Dutch. Denmark helped repel English squadrons from Bergen, and Danish and Dutch squadrons joined to close the Sound to all English shipping. In the East Indies the warships of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compaagnie (VOC) destroyed nearly all English ships, and VOC ground forces captured several English forts and entrepôts (factories). In the Mediterranean the fight was more equal, with each side damaging the others’ merchant marine and curtailing trade. Zeeland privateer syndicates were also better organized than before, and did real damage to English shipping right from the start of the campaign. During two years of war, the Dutch Navy and privateers took over 500 English prizes, many of them and their cargos sold off in various neutral ports. The Dutch also finally began building larger warships, First Rates of 70 guns or more. The English battlefleet was fatefully divided by sending Prince Rupert with 20 ships down the Channel, while George Monk (Albemarle) with 56 sail remained in The Downs. As a result, the Royal Navy lost the “Four Days’ Battle,” or The Downs (June 1–4/11–14, 1666), to a Dutch fleet of 86 sail under de Ruyter. Two months later the English savaged the Dutch at the St. James’ Day Fight (July 25/August 4, 1666). And so the war at sea proceeded, seesawing back and forth in advantage without either side accruing a decisive victory. A notable English coup was achieved when Admiral Holmes took a fleet to the North Holland island of Terschelling. There, on August 9/19, 1666, he trapped and burned 160 Dutch merchantmen at anchor in an action sometimes called “Holmes’ Bonfire” by English naval historians. Despite this success, the overall English naval effort was increasingly undermined by cumulative ship losses. It was further damaged by outbreak of the “Great Plague,” and by the “Great Fire” of London (September 2–6, 1666), each event vividly recorded in the diary of naval administrator and eyewitness Samuel Pepys. The misery index climbed still higher as Dutch warships burned or barred colliers from making deliveries to London during the hard winter of 1666–1667. On June 12, 1667, de Ruyter retaliated for Terschelling by boldly sailing up the Thames to catch an English fleet unawares at anchor at the Medway, forcing the boom and brushing past several blockships to burn with fireship the three biggest warships of the Royal Navy and three other rated ships, plus several smaller ones, then to insolently tow away the flagship “Royal Charles.” In the West Indies the Dutch also enjoyed fresh success, recovering Essequebo and Pomeroon. An amphibious expedition took Paramaribo in Surinam from the English in 1667; another took Tobago. All this conflict did not prevent some pragmatic and humanitarian practices. For instance, by 1667 the two sides had\n\nAnglo-Dutch War, Third\n\nagreed on a system of mutually agreeable ransoming of each other’s prisoners of war. The war ended with agreement on the Treaty of Breda (July 11/21, 1667). Spurring the United Provinces to make peace with England was a renewed French invasion of t"
