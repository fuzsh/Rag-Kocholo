        "text": "On today’s date (September 2nd) in family history, the following events happened on my maternal side:\n\nIn 1862, my immigrant second great grandmother Anne (Anna) Marie Aloisia Heinzen was born in Lingwurm, a tiny hamlet of houses near Brig, Canton Valais, Switzerland. She was the daughter of Joseph Anton Heinzen and Italian-Swiss Regina Gentineta. Happy Birthday!\n\nIn 1881, my immigrant second great grand uncle Alexander Bold, who was born near Nuenschweiler, close to Alsace, France in Germany, two different Chicago newspapers published reports on his duties as a Chicago Police Officer. He raised an alarm when a four story brick plaining mill owned by Wintermeyer & Dempsey caught fire. It was a total loss for the company. He also struggled with a gun a perpetrator and shot him. Officer Alexander Bold had been on the scene because the perpetrator had shot five people.\n\nIn 1928, the Chicago Tribune ran an advertisement for my immigrant great grandfather Carmen Ferraro’s opera school at the Lyon-Healy building, in which he offered “part scholarships to few promising voices.”\n\nIn 1971, the Montreal Gazette featured a story on a American detective agency run by a woman, which was rare in those days. The article mentioned that she and her former boss, my first cousin two times removed Albert R. Valerioti, attended the World Detective Conference happening in Montreal. It also states, that he was called the “Prince of Detectives” because decades before he was responsible for transporting Hiroshima’s atomic bomb fragments from New York to Washington. Albert was the son of Angela Maria Ferraro, my great grandfather Carmen Ferraro’s sister.\n\nOn my paternal side, the following happened:\n\nIn 1791, my 5th great grandmother Rosalinda Maddalena Mincarelli was born in Penne, Abruzzo to Domenico and Anna Maria Giulia Di Federico. She was a lace maker and was the spouse of Massimo Antonio Nicola Uriano. If you are keeping tracek, she was an ancestor of Luigia Massei.\n\nAre we related, or do you have an addition or correction? Please email me, because for some reason WordPress does not send you my reply if you simply comment on this post. My email is-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nOn today’s date (August 30th) in family history, the following happened:\n\nIn 1811, my 6th great grandfather Giuseppe Marzola died in Farindola at 8 am at age 77. He was born in Farindola and lived at Rione della Croceria and was a contadino. His parents were Domenicantonio Marzola and Anna Maria Colella. He was the widow of Rosina Pompili. Domenico and Rosina are in my tree twice. They are the ancestors of both my paternal grandmother, through their daughter Giovanna Marzola, who was married to the Cancelliere di Farindola, Nicola Carusi, making them the ancestors of Luigia Massei; and, my paternal grandfather, through their son Domenico Marzola who married midwife Maria Donata Di Costanzo from Penne, making them ancestors of Serafina Merlenghi. This is why we research the female lines. The fact they were in my tree twice made my paternal grandparents 5th cousins to each other.\n\nAlso on today’s date in Farindola, a pair of several times over great grand aunts Apollonia Cirone and Anna Eleuteria Iannascoli passed away in 1817.\n\nOn my maternal side, the following happened:\n\nIn 1816, the parents of my immigrant 3rd great grandmother Marie Louise Koppel Eckebrecht, Johann Christoph Koppel and Anna Maria Dorothea Grabe were married in Koerner, Thuringia, Germany. Johann Christoph is noted as owner of the Riethmuhle (mill) on his children’s baptisms in Koerner through at least 1820. Koerner is on the River Unstrut. There is a Riethmuhle in Koerner as of 1900, at the west end of the village on the Heuberg Hill, on Notter Creek. At the time of Marie Louise’s death in the United States, her property included a mill in Germany that may have been this mill.\n\nIn 1820, a cousin several times removed, Bernardo Criscuolo, was born in Nola, outside Naples. He was a blood relation of Filomena Napolitano.\n\nIn 1854, my second great grandmother Katharina Schuttler was born in Chicago to immigrants John Schuttler and Louise Gerbing. She was my first ancestor born on this continent.\n\nIn 1866, my second great grand aunt Anna Maria Heinzen was born in Brig, Valais, Switzerland to Joseph Anton Heinzen and Italian-Swiss Regina Gentinetta.\n\nIn 1896, cousin several times removed, Charles Gerbing, won the German Wheelmen’s Race (Cycling) in Chicago but ended up being disqualified.\n\nFinally, it was reported in two newspapers on today’s date in 1912, that my great grandfather, Carmen Ferraro, used a stage name of Mr. Armanno Vittorio, and told the reporter he was from the Colon Theater in Buenos Aires, when he gave an operatic performance as a dramatic tenor.\n\nAre we related? Do you have an addition or correction? Please email me-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nOn today’s date in 1629, the witchcraft trial of my 10th great grandfather Martin Heinzen started at Freigericht Ganter, near Glis, Valais, Switzerland because someone in the local populace had sick livestock and other executed witches had implicated him as their accomplice. Martin ended up being tortured for nearly a week in hopes of extracting confessions of sorcery.\n\nMayor Kaspar Stockaler was the man responsible for routing out witches in the local population. Thirty witnesses had sworn statements against my 10th great grandfather.\n\nBecause Ganter didn’t have a torture device, they borrowed one from nearby Brig.\n\nThrough his long torture, Martin confessed every sin, and in an article in French on the subject of witchcraft trials in Valais, he confessed every “pecadillo” BUT sorcery. On the 12th of October 1629, friends and relatives of Martin demanded his release. So he was released and ordered to pay one third of the costs of his trial!\n\nWhen I found this sensational fact about my ancestor, I discovered that the witch trial madness had actually started in Valais, Switzerland in 1428 before it spread to the rest of Europe. It started there! You can find headings about this sad phenomena under such headings as “Valais witch trials” and “Swiss werewolf witch trials.” I am still searching for a book in English on the subject.\n\nMartin went on to marry and have my 9th great grandfather Kaspar Heinzen. Of note is the fact that Martin’s wife and Kaspar’s mother – Barbara Andamatten, shared a surname with one of Ganter’s witchcraft judges.\n\nMartin Heinzen’s tale appears in “Das Freigerecht Ganter” and “Notes sur les procès d’hérésie et de sorcellerie en Valais” because he was an accused sorcerer that walked away from one of these terrible trials with his life.\n\nI suspect Martin may be my 10th great grandfather two times over. I need to do some more digging. Martin is the ancestor of my immigrant second great grandmother Anne Marie Aloisia Heinzen.\n\nDo you have Swiss ancestors accused of sorcery? Have you found European ancestors accused of witchcraft?\n\nSources:\n\nDionys Imesch, “Das Freigericht Ganter”, dans Blätter aus der Walliser Geschichte, Bd 3, 1902-1906, S. 70-100, surtout p. 82-83 (http://doc.rero.ch/record/200661)\n\nKirchegemeinde Glis\n\n“Hexerei im Oberwallis” um 1600 von Hans Steffen\n\nJules-Bernard Bertrand, “Notes sur les procès d’hérésie et de sorcellerie en Valais”, dans Annales valaisannes, 1921, vol. 3, n° 2-3, p. 151-194, surtout p. 189-191 (en ligne: http://doc.rero.ch/record/6753)\n\nThank you to the great people in Genealogie Familienforschung Ahnenforschung Schweiz and Genealogy Translations…\n\nThis post was originally shared 4 years ago on this date.\n\ncinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nSwitzerland\n\nJohann Joseph Heinzen was born near Brig, Valais, Switzerland in 1782 to my fifth great grandfather Joseph Ignaz Christian Heinzen, and his first wife, Anne Marie Fintschen. According to Le soldat valaisan au service de l’Empereur Napoléon: un service étranger différent (1806-1811) – in Vallesia, by Louiselle de Riedmatten, via Geneanet, when he was baptized, his godfather was Major D. Joseph Berenfaller. I did a quick search of the Berenfallers and believe they were a local Brig family.\n\nOn May 1, 1807, at age 24, Johann Joseph entered into the foreign service of Emperor Napoleon. His matricule number was 465. He was my 4th great grand uncle.\n\nAt this time I would like to acknowledge the various other Heinzens, Mutters, and Gentinettas that are distant cousins, or whom I cannot currently verify a relationship to, who were in Napoleon’s foreign service. They would all be relations of immigrant Anne Marie Heinzen Kirsch.\n\nItaly\n\nMeanwhile, south of Switzerland in Italy, in 1808, my sixth great grandfather Paolo Carusi was made Luogotenete (Lieutenant) of the Guardia Urbano by the local occupying Bonapartist French military leader. He would have been around 72 years old at this time.\n\nPaolo was given command of 12 French soldiers with the purpose of hunting down the brigands of Farindola and the environs. In fact, some of the local brigands made alliances against the French, and were former soldiers themselves, who had fought against the Bonapartists in the north of Italy in the 1790s. These former soldiers included one Massimo Marcella of Trosciano, purported to be the local go-between between brigand factions. Paolo Carusi, and this period of upheaval in Farindola, are mentioned in the book Storia di Farindola, Dalle Origini ai Giorni Nostri by Antonio Procacci.\n\nGennaro Carusi, in his great book, I Carusi, suggests that Paolo may have been chosen for this assignment because he may have had prior military experience.\n\nI have written here before of Paolo and his children. Paolo Carusi was also one of the few in Farindola that could write. Paolo was the ancestor of Luigia Maria Massei.\n\n-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nImmigrant Leo Heinzen was born in 1878 to Joseph Anton Heinzen and Italian-Swiss Regina Gentinetta in Brig, Valais, Switzerland. He came to the United States in 1907. He was a younger brother of my great great grandmother Anna Heinzen Kirsch.\n\nLeo first appeared on the radar in the United States on the 1910 Federal Census in Chicago living with his sister Anna, her husband Louis Kirsch, and son Albert Kirsch. He verbalized that he had been living in the United States since 1907, possessed papers (when asked if he was a citizen), stated he was a laborer in any kind of industry, could speak English, read, but could not write.\n\nNext, on September 13, 1918, Leo completed a World War I Draft Registration card in Battle Creek, Michigan. The box was checked on the card for having declared for citizenship as an alien of the United States. According to the information on the card, he was employed at that time as a cook at the Treo Café in Battle Creek. His physical appearance was: brown eyes, black hair, stout build, and medium height. He possessed no physical deformalities to preclude him from service either. His sister Anne Kirsch was listed on the line for nearest relative. Had his age qualified him for service, immigrant Leo Heinzen would have served in the United States military during WWI regardless of his citizenship status.\n\nLeo is then found on the 1920 census in Battle Creek living as a roomer, and still declaring his occupation as a cook.\n\nResearching Anna’s brother Leo was the reason I found the actual place of origin of Anna and Leo in Switzerland. In fact, the next record I found chronologically for Leo even gave me their parents’ names. On December 26, 1920, in Battle Creek, Michigan, Leo Heinzen married German immigrant Olga Kindt Timmens. Both of their sets of parents were listed on the record as was well as their birthplaces.\n\nUntil I found the record stating he was born in Brig, I thought Anna and Leo were born in Berg, because an American death record wasn’t clearly written.\n\nThe occupation on Leo’s marriage record was cook and Olga’s was listed as magnetic healer. They were married by the Reverend Anna L. Gillepsie. I thought it was interesting that they were married by a female minister so I looked her up on newspapers.com. She was a well-known spiritualist minister who was often away from Battle Creek in Lily Dale, NY at Spiritualist assembly meetings.\n\nReverend Gillespie also married Olga to her first husband, Frank Timmens, in 1915. He too was a magnetic healer. I couldn’t resist finding out what happened to Olga’s first husband. I don’t know the circumstances, or when Olga and Frank split, but Frank remarried in 1922 in the Roman Catholic Church, according to Michigan marriage records, and as evidenced by advertisements found on newspapers.com, he continued the magnetic healing occupation.\n\nIn 1925, great grand uncle Leo was sworn in as a citizen of the United States.\n\nIn 1926, in her own right, and not by the default of the citizenship of her spouse, Olga Kindt Timmens Heinzen was sworn in as a citizen of the United States. She is the only woman I can find on my mother’s side of the family that voluntarily took the oath to become a citizen after they changed the naturalization laws allowing women to take their own oath. I suppose that Elena Ferraro and Gelsomina Ferraro could have become citizens this way too, however, I haven’t found proof of that to date.\n\nI next located Leo and Olga on the 1930 Federal Census. It appears as though he and Olga never had children. Leo and Olga were both listed as magnetic healers on that census. I assume this was part of their practice in the First Spiritualist Church of Battle Creek or a form of alternative healing therapy. Today they use the term mesmerist interchangeably with magnetic healing. Have fun looking these alternative forms of healing online!\n\nI found several advertisements for Leo Heinzen as a Spiritual Healer in the classifieds in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nThere was a tidbit in a 1945 article called “History as News” that did a throwback to 10 years ago in which it stated that Leo Heinzen was the assistant chef at the well-known Battle Creek hotel The Post Tavern for at least three years.\n\nLike his brother-in-law, immigrant Louis Kirsch, Leo, who was born in Brig Switzerland, where Louis studied, was also a chef at a famous Midwest Hotel.\n\nIn 1946, Olga passed away due to a months long illness according to her obituary.\n\nLeo passed away in 1962 in Michigan, at age 83, but 81, according to his obituary, which mentions Leo’s healing practice and the fact that he had several nieces and nephews in Switzerland. It didn’t mention his 9 great nieces and great nephews in America.\n\nLeo leaves several intriguing questions. First, I have not found any record of entry for him into the United States. Is this another case of a bad transcription error or a misspelling like all of the censuses I found Leo on? (The transcriptions on Ancestry for Leo’s census records were terrible. He was never an engineer or electrician!) Then there are those questions about his life. Like his sister Anna, as an adult, they didn’t practice the Catholic faith, after being raised in it. Did Leo have a healing gift? Or on the other hand, were he and Olga just taking money? Or was it just part of practicing his faith? Was he drawn to the Spiritualist Church through Olga or was he a member before he met her? Finally, did any of the Ferraros meet him?\n\nSources:\n\nUnited States Federal Censuses\n\nWorld War I Draft Records\n\nMichigan Marriage Records\n\nMichigan Naturalization Records\n\nMichigan Death/Burial Records\n\nCity Directories for Battle Creek, Michigan\n\nNewspapers.com\n\nWikipedia.org\n\ncinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nImmigrant Anne Marie Aloisia Heinzen, my great great grandmother, sailed from Le Havre, France to Castle Garden, New York in 1885. She was born in the hamlet of Lingwurm near Ried-Brig, Canton Valais, Switzerland in 1862. Valais is a Catholic canton that is split between French and German speaking regions. It is in the south of the country that borders Italy. Brig is in the German speaking region. Anna (as she was known in America) was the oldest of at least 6 children born to Anton Joseph Heinzen and Regina Anna Maria Catharina Josepha Philomena Gentinetta.\n\nDoes anyone want to help decipher the surname of her godmother? I can email a copy of the record to you. Anna’s grandfather, Francois Joseph Gentinetta was born in Bognanco, Piemonte, Italy. Perhaps he went by Francesco right, except Bognanco speaks a Germanic dialect…\n\nI have detailed Anna’s trip and landing in America in this older post: On this day in 1885 at Castle Garden Emigrant Landing Depot, 22 Year Old Great Great Grandmother Anna Heinzen arrived in America.\n\nIn the interest of not repeating things, previous posts on the Heinzen and Gentinetta are here and here. A post about information received from a wonderful researcher in Switzerland pertaining to Anna’s siblings was previously posted around last Christmas and can be read here: Heinzen – Gentinetta Update (Helen Kirsch Ferraro’s Swiss Ancestry).\n\nNow I would like to detail what we know about Anna in America. Anna had met Louis (Ludwig Fritz Kirsch) in Brig where he had studied to learn how to become a chef. Louis was already in Chicago when she landed at Castle Garden. They married before the Justice of the Peace on September 9, 1886. Anna was Catholic and Louis was Lutheran. On September 22, 1887, their first child, my great grandmother, Helen was born. Their son Albert Victor was born in 1891. Both children were raised as Lutherans. When my great great grandfather naturalized in 1896, Anna automatically became a citizen of the United States as his lawful wife. Women couldn’t naturalize as independent individuals until after they gained the right to vote.\n\nAccording to the 1900 Federal Census, Anna said she was a mother of 3 and that only 2 were living. Anna and Louis had apparently suffered the loss of a child. Anna’s brother Leo lived with them for a little while when he first arrived in Chicago and worked as a cook like Louis. Leo’s immigrant story will be featured in a different week. Leo and his wife were mentioned on newspapers.com several time.\n\nOn July 27, 1906, Anna was in the Chicago Tribune when she was interviewed about her daughter, Helen, who was a major witness in a homicide case. Great Grandmother Helen: Witness in the 1906 Murder Case of Mrs. Louise Gentry. Publishing the address of a witness in a murder trial is really something else huh? That was the only reference I could find on Anna Heinzen Kirsch on newspapers.com. We do not have a photo of her either.\n\nAfter Anna’s children moved out and started their own families, she became a dressmaker. She lost her husband in 1925 and, since she was alone in the house, she took in immigrant Greek and Italian boarders at her home 46 Linden Place for income. Her daughter Helen passed away in 1927 and in 1931 some of Helen and Carmen’s children came to live with her. By 1940 Anna had moved in with her son Albert, his wife, son and daughter in Downers Grove, Illinois.\n\nAnna passed away in 1948 in Downers Grove, Illinois. She was 86. We have no photos of Anna. Her daughter Helen had green eyes. According to the World War I draft registration of Albert, he was brown haired, brown eyed and slight with a medium height. According to her brother Leo’s draft registration, he was black haired and black eyed.\n\nAnna’s Son Albert\n\nWe already know daughter Helen married Carmen Ferraro and they had 9 children. Albert Victor married Elva Witzigerrenter, who was born in Wisconsin. Albert was a pressman at a printing company, and by 1940 had been made foreman there. They had two children that served in World War II. Lois Kirsch served in the Cadet Nursing Corps. Delbert Kirsch served in the United States Army. Albert died two years after Anna in 1950.\n\nNotes About Researching the Heinzens\n\nAbout two years ago I was at a wall with Anna and began to research her brother Leo Heinzen. It was an American record pertaining to his marriage that led me to Brig, Valais, Switzerland. About the same time I emailed the archives for the baptismal record of Anna, I had mailed letters to every Heinzen in the Brig area and received help from the sweetest citizens of Switzerland. Cornelia Heinzen and Hans Heinzen both received my letter. Neither of them are related to Anna but sent information about the Heinzens. Another Heinzen forwarded to me a picture of Brig in the valley. Coincidentally, a knitting friend of mine, JL, also has ancestry from Valais and Northern Italy. She looked up information on the Heinzen and Gentinetta and sent me information on both families. Finally, a local historian and author named Renato Arnold received the letter from his father-in-law, a Heinzen. He went to the archives and researched the immediate family and he forwarded the information on Anna’s brothers and sisters. I am glad I took the advice of another researcher and sent those letters to the Brig area.\n\nThe wonderful staff in the Valais Archives went above and beyond sending me records, censuses, and information on the Gentinetta, and always replying to me in English. In the future, I would like to find out what Anna’s father did for a living. Also, wouldn’t it be something to trace all the way back to that first Heinzen in Brig to 1389? Eventually the records for Verbano-Cusio-Ossola Province in Italy will be online.\n\nSources:\n\nArchives of Canton Valais, Sion\n\nRenato Arnold, Cornelia Heinzen, Hans Heinzen, and others in Ried-Brig\n\nCook County Marriages, Births and Deaths\n\nUnited States Federal Censuses\n\nCastlegarden.org/New York Passenger Lists\n\nUnited States Veterans Death Indexes\n\nWorld War I Draft Registration Cards\n\nUnited States City Directories\n\nWorld War II Cadet Nursing Card Files\n\nUnited States Social Security Applications\n\nLouis Kirsch’s naturalization\n\n~Next immigrant: #5 The Disappearing Antonio Ferraro…\n\ncinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net"
