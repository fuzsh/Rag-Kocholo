Nestled in the heart of Europe, the Swiss Confederation (the country’s official title) is home to over 7.5 million people who speak four national languages, including their indigenous tongue, Romansh. The Latin name for Switzerland is “Confederatio Helvetica,” from which the abbreviation “CH” comes. You’ll notice the “CH” on many buildings, products, cars and on postal codes throughout Switzerland. For the first-time traveler, Switzerland is a dream come true. The country – which celebrated its 700th anniversary in 1991 – is clean, the local people and those in the tourism industry are helpful and courteous, and the public transport systems are unmatched anywhere in the world. Local roads and highways (autobahns) are extremely easy for the neophyte visitor to navigate. The experienced explorer can return time and again to this small, mountainous country and always find a new peak to ascend, another pass to hike, an isolated lake to swim or fish in, and another small village to investigate.\n\nM\n\n© 2008 HUNTER PUBLISHING, INC\n\nGeneva\n\nBasel\n\nBienne\n\nVAL\n\nAIS\n\nB\n\nThun\n\nLucerne\n\nPS E AL\n\nALP\n\nS\n\nZermatt\n\nRhône\n\nES ERN\n\nZug\n\nRUS\n\nALP\n\nLake Lugano\n\nLugano\n\nS\n\nGlarus Chur\n\nde nse e\n\nSt Gallen\n\nBo\n\nWalensee\n\nLocarno\n\nTICINO ALPS\n\nGLA\n\nAltdorf\n\nSchwyz\n\nZürichsee\n\nZürich\n\nLake Maggiore\n\nLake Lucerne\n\nAarau\n\nWinterthur\n\nSchaffhausen\n\nun e r See Interlaken\n\nSolothurn\n\nDelémont\n\nBERN\n\nMontreux\n\nrs Bi Th\n\nLac Léman\n\nLausanne\n\nLa Chauxde-Fonds Neuchâtel e l c d te La châ u e N Fribourg\n\nPrincipal Cities, Mountain Ranges & Lakes\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSt Moritz\n\nDavos\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition to the striking beauty of its Alpine scenery, Switzerland is Europe’s center for international banking and manufacture of quality goods. As well, Switzerland is home to a variety of unique customs and traditions. Nearly 68% of the population speaks German, 20% speaks French and about 10% speaks Italian. The ancient, traditional Swiss language of Romansh isspoken by a very few. Landlocked by Germany on the north, Austria and Liechtenstein on the east, Italy on the south and France on the West, Switzerland contains several glorious mountains that rise above 14,000 feet (4,300 m). In terms of land mass, it is slightly smaller than New Jersey. The three major regions of the country are divided by a series of mountainous belts that run northeast to southwest. This trio of regions – the Jura, the Swiss Plateau, and the Alps – all follow this directional pattern, and are altered only in certain spots by the rivers that run between mountains. While the largest area of the country is in the Rhine Basin, a small area in the south is drained by the Ticino, and in the southwest by the Rhône. Neutrality is another Swiss tradition, and one that is carried out through the country’s 26 cantons, each of which contains a local governmental unit. As one of the most advanced industrialized nations in the world, Switzerland also has the distinction of being one of the oldest democracies. The federal government, with its headquarters in the capital of Bern, has a somewhat restricted jurisdiction and limited powers. A Federal Council heads the executive branch of the government, and a president and vice-president are chosen from among the Council’s seven members. Both federal and cantonal court systems exist, and a Council of States is made up of 46 members – one or two members from each of the cantons. Election methods and office terms are decided by each canton individually. Switzerland offers the traveler a wide array of climates and settings. One morning you might be on top of the Klein (small) Matterhorn, observing Alpine peaks in a snug down ski jacket in the mountainous canton of Valais. The next afternoon you could be sipping a glass of wine under a palm tree on the banks\n\n4 What This Book Will Tell You\n\nof Lake Lugano in your swimsuit. The following night would find you strolling across the Chapel Bridge in the Old Town of Lucerne, wearing a T-shirt and jeans, while the picturesque Alps loom up in the background. From the high-speed trains that can whisk you from Bern to Paris in only four hours to Zermatt’s famous Gornergrat Railway, no trip would be complete without at least one ride on the indefatigable Swiss Federal Rail system. A relaxing journey on one of Switzerland’s many waterways gives a different perspective on the beautiful scenery, which seems never-ending. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a trip that’s sure to bring you lots of chocolate, cheese, stunning scenery and fresh, crisp mountain air – complemented by Swiss cuisine, efficiency, and a rich history.\n\nWhat This Book Will Tell You For 25 years I have been living in and visiting Switzerland on a yearly basis. My travels throughout this Alpine country have been as a writer, farm hand, and tour guide. I’ve gotten to experience Switzerland as the Swiss do, and have visited the little out-of-the-way places few tourists ever see. This book – now in a handy, pocket-guide edition – will help you to explore those places, as well as the traditional hot spots. For this pocket edition, we’ve added many new hikes and other outdoor sports for both the neophyte and the most seasoned of Swiss travelers.\n\nHow This Book is Organized After this introduction – which gives you a broad overview of Swiss life and culture – we’ll tell you how to get the most out of your visit. You’ll learn about the seven regions of Switzerland, and the cantons (areas akin to our counties) within those regions, as well as their major attractions and cities. Within each canton profile we’ll highlight the history of the region and then give some basic information – accommodations, restaurants, best sights, and don’t-miss spots. Of course, some\n\nThe Seven Regions of Switzerland 5\n\nThe Seven Regions of Switzerland For the purposes of this book, we have divided Switzerland into seven distinct regions in order to help you with your travels throughout this beautiful and unique country. Swiss geography was originally formed through the development of glaciers. Switzerland became a stunning mixture of valleys, gently rolling hills, ominous mountains, and streams, rivers and landlocked lakes – all the result of glaciers. Over time, and as more areas became part of the Swiss Confederation, the development of the cantons evolved. Starting with the original three cantons of Switzerland (Schwyz, Glarus, and Uri), another 23 eventually joined them, each with its own unique history, culture and traditions. This guide begins by examining the northern region of Switzerland, and then moves to the southeast, before covering the middle of the country. We then make our way up to the northwestern and southwestern sides of Switzerland, before journeying farther south to the most mountainous portion of the country.\n\nHistory Geography played a vital role in the history of the development of Switzerland. The brutal terrain provided a barrier of unity for the Swiss, and gave them independence from outside neighbors. Switzerland was once part of the mighty Roman Empire during the first century BC. A Celtic tribe known as the Helvetii was conquered by the Romans and continued to live under their protection, until the Germans invaded the area in the fifth century. The country eventually became part of the Holy Roman Empire again in the 11th century after a series of battles.\n\nIntroduction\n\ncantons, such as Zug or Appenzell-Innerrhoden, will have less to see and do than the cantons of Bern, Valais, or Graubünden. You’ll get information on the best times of the year to visit certain areas, and insights into traditional festivals, such as Bern’s Onion Festival and Basel’s Faschnacht, as well as the annual national Schwingfest. As many Swiss would say, “Viel spass und viel Glück!” – Have fun and much luck!\n\n6 How This Book is Organized\n\nIn 1291 the three cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden banded together and formed the Swiss Confederation – celebrating their independence from all other factions on August 1st of that year, which is still celebrated as the national independence day throughout Switzerland. During the centuries that followed, more cantons were added to the young country. Lucerne joined in 1332, Zürich in 1351, Glarus and Zug in 1352 and Bern in 1353 as territorial William Tell expansion accelerated. However, at times small wars would break out between the cantons, as each one struggled for military control and power. Cantons Fribourg and Solothurn were admitted to Switzerland in 1481, Basel and Schaffhausen in 1501, and Appenzell in 1513. As additional cantons were added, Switzerland’s economy flourished. Silkgoods, linens, wool and cottons experienced the greatest growth and, by the 18th century, Geneva had gained a reputation for clock production. Zürich became the center for literature and new ideas. Napoleon had a short stint of supervision over Switzerland in the late 1790s, which gave France the ability to recruit 14-15,000 men for his national army. After his demise, Switzerland was forced to develop a new constitution, which was christened the Pact of 1815, giving Swiss citizens freedom of religion, of movement, and freedom from occupation. The cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva were officially established at this time as well.\n\nGeography 7\n\nThe Land Geography Though Switzerland appears to be all mountains, the geography offers a wide variety of features. For instance, the Jura Mountains – which form part of the French/Swiss border – provide a setting of lush pastures and green meadows. Lying between the Jura and the Alps is the Central Plateau, where nearly two-thirds of the Swiss make their homes. Herein lie the majority of family farms and major cities as well. As one passes to the south and southeast,\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the mid-1800s, Switzerland’s history has remained fairly quiet, and the Swiss have remained unyielding in their commitment to neutrality, even as the European Union evolved and developed all around them. During both world wars, Switzerland was faced with hostile neighbors, and was able to maintain neutrality and become a center for international organizations, such as the Red Cross. Modern Switzerland has not been unscathed by 20th-century wars, however. In the mid-1990s the Swiss government was accused of selling weapons to the Nazis, and many people who had family members perish in the Holocaust filed lawsuits against Swiss banks, accusing them of illegally keeping money and other assets deposited by victims both before and during World War II. In 1998 several Swiss banks agreed to a $1.25 billion settlement, but the government did not opt to participate in the settlement. To this day, the Swiss remain adamantly opposed to joining the European Union. “Switzerland has had but one hero, William Tell, and he is a myth,” wrote English author and humorist Max Beerbohm. Legend never really says if Tell was a man or a myth, but you can find a statue of him in nearly every town, village and city in Switzerland. The Swiss see Tell as a symbol of independence and the love of liberty, which has characterized this tiny country for centuries.\n\n8 The Land\n\nthe Alps rise up as rocky crags, snowy peaks, glaciers and gorges. Peaking at 15,203 feet (4,635 m) is the highest point, Dufourspitze, in the Monte Rosa group near the Italian border. There are 50 peaks that tower higher than 12,000 feet – among them, the famous Matterhorn, the Eiger, and the Jungfrau. Still farther south, the Alps plummet into Ticino, home to palm trees, warm Mediterranean breezes, and heavy Italian influences.\n\nThe Alps There are many distinct regions of the Swiss Alps. These relatively compact (by North American standards) mountain ranges cover 60% of the country, and are home to glaciers that comprise about 772 square miles of land (2,000 square km). Switzerland is also home to the most extensive glacier range in Europe, the Aletsch Glacier, which covers 65 square miles (169 square km). Dufourspitze, at 15,203 ft (4,635 m) is Switzerland’s highest peak. The Alps actually are formed of two parallel mountain ranges: the Bernese Aletsch Glacier Oberland in the west-central part of Switzerland move north into the Glarus Alps, while the southwestern Pennine Alps continue on into the Lepontine Alps and the Rheatian Alps. The Bernese Alps (Bernese Oberland) rise to 14,022 feet (4,300 m) at the Finsteraarhorn, and to 13,642 (4,146 m) at the Junfgrau, the highest peaks in that region. This area can be crossed at only two places in the 110-mile range: either the difficult and steep Grimsel Pass, or the much easier valley of the Reuss – itself a narrow and deep crossing. The towering Pennine Alps are separated from the Bernese Alps by the valleys of the upper Rhône and Rhine rivers, whose waters discharge in opposite directions. These two val-\n\nThe Climate 9\n\nAvalanches Avalanches often occur when the first snows follow unseasonably cold temperatures. A season with steady snowfalls is preferable to a season where heavy snowfalls are mixed with weeks of rain, snow-drought and severe temperature changes. They can also occur after a very heavy snowfall which is accompanied by wind, especially on a sunny afternoon during which some of the snow begins to thaw. The Swiss are much more accustomed to avalanches than are visitors, and tend to be more careful than tourists. In fact, the Weissfluhjoch (Swiss Avalanche Institute) predicts that an average winter will claim the lives of over 100 skiers and mountaineers, compared to 10-15 avalanche fatalities in the US.\n\nRivers, Lakes & Streams Switzerland has often been called Europe’s “mother of rivers,” as the melted waters from snow and glaciers drain down into two of the continent’s greatest rivers – the Rhine and the Rhône. The Ticino River joins the Po in Italy, while the Inn combines with the Danube on the Austrian-German border. Waterfalls abound through Switzerland, and can provide spectacular photo opportunities. Nearly all of these waterfalls and rivers eventually make their way to the European shores, hundreds of miles south.\n\nThe Climate Switzerland’s climate is greatly influenced by the Alps, although in some parts of the country these giants offer protection from the often-fierce elements. Though temperatures tend to vary with the altitude, one can expect warm summers and cold winters. The summers are shorter and winters longer in the Alps, with the first snows falling near the end of September. Peaks at 9,000 feet (2,740 m)\n\nIntroduction\n\nleys are linked by passes at their heads, and contain most of the Alps’ population. The southern range can be crossed by a number of passes, none of which are easy, and many of which are closed in the wintertime or made extremely dangerous due to massive amounts of snow and ice. The Simplon, the St. Gotthard and the St. Bernard passes are used the most.\n\n10 Government\n\nand higher usually stay snow-topped all year and rain falls throughout the country during all four seasons. Rainfall can be heavy in the summer months, especially in the valleys. In the winter, a dismal fog can hang over the valleys while, thousands of feet above, skiers bask in the warm rays of sunlight.\n\nFlora & Fauna While Switzerland has nearly every kind of flower that can be found anywhere else in the world, it is renowned for its famed edelweiss. The unofficial national flower (Leontopodium alpinum) is strictly protected throughout the entire country, and grows on dry meadows and rocky areas in strong sunlight up to Edelweiss 10,168 feet (3,100 m) above sea level. It is characterized by its beautiful, delicate, tiny white flowers with six to seven thin petals, growing two to four inches tall.\n\nWild & Domesticated Animals A typical variety of animals can be found here: squirrels, snakes, moles, and other ground rodents, as well as a wide range of birds and bats. There are also bearded vultures, golden eagles, marmots, elk, chamois and deer. Several varieties of cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and rabbits are all productive livestock. In addition, turkeys, ducks, geese, mules, llamas, ostriches, bees, and even bison are slowly gaining popularity. Switzerland is also home to seven official dog breeds, including the Swiss mountain dog and the St. Bernard.\n\nGovernment witzerland is a republic, made up of 23 full cantons and three half-cantons – Appenzell, Basel, Unterwalden – for a total of 26. While the structure of government varies slightly from canton to canton, there are basic similarities. Each canton has an\n\nS\n\nPolitical Parties 11\n\nPolitical Parties There are four major political parties in Switzerland and several minor parties. The Christian-Democratic People’s Party defends the interests of Roman Catholics and cantonal rights. The Radical Democrats represent the liberal center, while the Social Democrats are moderates who tend to favor greater federal action in social reform. Founded in 1971, the Swiss People’s Party has less support than the other three major parties, and tends toward more liberal views. Other smaller parties exist as well, such as the Green, Liberal, Independent, and Communist parties.\n\nThe Court System The Swiss court system is headed by the Federal Court in Lausanne. This court does not have the power of judicial review of federal legislation, but instead functions as a court of appeal for the cantonal court systems, which are responsible for trying cases at the lowest levels. The Federal Court also serves for trials concerning treason and for disputes between cantons, or between the confederation and a canton.\n\nIntroduction\n\nadministrative council and a type of legislative assembly, though election methods can differ widely. Referendum techniques and popular incentive are used by most cantons, while a few utilize the ancient custom of Landesgemeinde – an annual open-air assembly of all citizens that are at least 18 years old. This Landesgemeinde has power of legislation and must approve all laws and regulations drafted by the body of people within the canton. Each canton is entrusted with powers in all matters that are not federal in nature, which means each canton has control over health, education and sanitation, for example. However, cantons must also conform to standards set by the federal legislative body in the capital of Bern. Cantons are also required to adhere to federal standards in regard to military training. Police and the court system are handled on a cantonal basis, with the exception of the Federal Court, Switzerland’s highest tribunal.\n\n12 The Economy\n\nThe Military The military in Switzerland is geared solely to defense. The Swiss have a system in place to destroy every tunnel, bridge and pass leading into or out of Switzerland in the event of a national emergency. All men between the ages of 20 and 42 must serve in the military. Those who cannot serve for various reasons are subject to a special tax.\n\nThe Economy witzerland has long been known as one of the\n\nSmostAges, prosperous countries in the world. Since the Sfr Middle commerce has been at the heart of the\n\nSwiss economy and due to the country’s neutral status, it also became an ideal place for banking and a safe haven for foreign investments. Besides banking and commerce, tourism is a major industry, with the visitors sometimes outnumbering the locals. These foreigners help to support hotels, restaurants, bars, and all forms of transportation. Internationally known resorts such as St. Moritz, Gstaad, Interlaken and Zermatt help to promote tourism with their year-round accessibility. The excellent railway system and highways, bridges, cable cars, funiculars and ski lifts make mountainous areas accessible that were not so a hundred years ago. Also, you can easily access Switzerland from Italy, France, Austria, and Germany on the passenger ships that ply lakes Geneva, Lugano and Constance. About 75% of Switzerland is used for various types of agriculture or forestry and, of this, only about 10% is used for crops, such as potatoes and grains. Vineyards encompass another small percentage, while about 40% of the land is used for grazing. Dairy farming is the most productive branch of agriculture, supporting the production of milk, cheese, butter, and chocolate. However, only about 4% of the Swiss labor force is involved in some type of agriculture. Engineering, textiles and chemical production are the leading manufacturing industries, utilizing about 20% of the Swiss labor force. Switzerland has almost no mineral fuels, and thus has to import about 80% of its energy needs. This affected the\n\nLanguages 13\n\nA\n\nThe Swiss currency is “Schweizerfranken” – Swiss Francs or Franken. CHF or SFr are often used to represent Swiss francs when written, as in 15SFr. One Swiss franc equals 100 “rappen.” When exchanging money it is best to go to a bank or currency exchange – hotel rates can be obscenely high. Exchange rates at the time of publication were 1SFr=US$0.73 or £0.46.\n\nThe People Languages “Unity through diversity” is the motto of the Swiss people, and loyalty to a specific canton, hometown or village tends to be strong. Diversity is accentuated by the four languages – German, French, Italian and Romansh, each of which has many regional dialects. Also, the German spoken by many Swiss is not “Hochdeutsch” or high German – the German taught in schools – but Swiss German or “Schweizerdeutsch.” Swiss German can sound completely different from canton to canton, and usually reflects the people and their society, changing as you travel from north to south or from east to west. Switzerland is predominantly German (74%), while 20% are French and just 4% are of Italian descent. Romansh and other\n\nIntroduction\n\ngrowth of many manufacturing plants, who had to wait for the country to develop its hydroelectric power. Engineering facilities are near Zürich and Basel primarily, while textile producers – second only to engineering plants – are found mostly in northeastern Switzerland. Switzerland was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association in 1960, but chose to stay out of the European Economic Community (EEC or Common Market) – later called the European Union (EU). The United States and Japan are Switzerland’s chief non-European trading partners. Swiss foreign trade consists of the exportation of engineering, chemical and textile products, while the top imports are agricultural products, machinery, transportation and construction equipment.\n\n14 Food\n\nnationalities account for the remaining 2%. In terms of religion, 48% are Roman Catholic and 44% Protestant.\n\nEducation The cantons are responsible for education of children, most of whom attend public schools from ages five, six or seven until age 16. Private schools are very expensive, and many Swiss believe that a child only attends a private school if he can’t make it in a public school. The cantons vary on education levels and rules, which can prove difficult for parents who move to a new canton in the middle of a school year. For instance some cantons start to teach foreign languages in the fourth grade, while others start in the seventh. Public schools begin with Kindergarten, followed by Volksschule (elementary school), then Gymnasium (secondary school), and finally Universitäten (universities). After elementary school, children may choose to go to a middle school or they can begin an apprenticeship in a variety of trades – everything from cooking and banking, to farming and horsemanship. After finishing their apprenticeship it is then possible to continue an academic career at a secondary school or at a “Fachhochschule” (FH) – technical college. There are eight universities in Switzerland – six are run by cantons and two run by the federal government.\n\nFood veryday traditions revolving around foods are widespread. Take raclette, for instance. This dish is made up of a threemonth-old loaf of Bagnes cheese, which is cut in half and placed over an open fire to melt slowly. When melted, it is scraped onto a plate, spiced with pepper and added to pickled onions and sour gherRaclette kins, along with small,\n\nE\n\nWinter Sports 15\n\nboiled potatoes. This popular Swiss dish hails from Canton Valais. Another traditional Swiss dish is fondue, a mixture of Gruyère and Emmentaler cheeses, garlic, wine and kirsch (cherry brandy). Fondue is typically prepared in an earthenware pot over a tiny stove in the middle of the dinner table. Guests are given a long fork, on which they place small chunks of bread. Fondue They then dip the bread into the fondue, and try their best not to lose the bread in the cheese mixture. If a guest loses his bread in the fondue pot, he or she must then forfeit either a bottle of wine, or a kiss to the host/ hostess and other members of the opposing gender seated at the table. Fondue is really a specialty of the western cantons of Switzerland, but has become a national and worldwide favorite. There are several varieties, but the best-known is the Neuchâtel fondue, which includes wine, Emmental (Gruyère) cheese, garlic, paprika, pepper and corn flour. You’ll also find other fondues such as the fondue Waadtländer, where the only addition to the aforementioned recipe is butter. Fondue Genfer (Geneva) adds egg yolks, nutmeg and cream to the mixture for added flavor.\n\nThe Adventures Winter Sports Switzerland is home to a wide variety of winter sports, and is known for having some of the best ski areas anywhere in the world. The winter season typically runs from December to April, although above 8,202 feet (2,500 m) it lasts from November to May because of the excellent snow coverage most years. The Swiss Ski Federation is located at Haus des Skisports, Worbstrasse 52, Postfach 478, CH-3074 Muri bei Bern. % 31-\n\n16 The Adventures\n\n950-6111.

You’ll find 90 shops in 65 different locations throughout Switzerland, and you can reserve your equipment via the Internet prior to your trip and it will be waiting for you when you arrive. Cross-country skiing (known as Langlauf in German) is very popular in Switzerland. Some of the best cross-country trekking regions are in the canton of Graubünden, which has 94 miles (150 km) of pistes near St. Moritz. At Laax-Flims near Chur and Davos, there are 47 miles (75 km) of trails and many in the Gstaad region as well. Ski touring is a combination of cross-country and downhill skiing. Great itineraries abound between Chamonix, Zermatt and Engadine. This sport is for those who are experienced and in good shape, and it’s usually undertaken with an experienced guide. Skijoring i s a n exhilarating sport w h er e y ou a r e towed on skis behind a galloping horse. You must be in excellent physical condition to attempt this. Skijoring races on snow are held in St. Moritz on a reguSkijoring (Tibor Menyhért) lar basis. Zorbing is the latest craze for those who just can’t get enough excitement in their lives. For this sport, you are strapped inside a giant plastic ball – arms and legs spread out – and then hurled down the side of a mountain.\n\nSummer Sports 17\n\n“Zorbonauts,” as they’re known, can now either strap themselves in wet or dry. For those who prefer going dry, they’re strapped in standing upright. For those who want the washing machine experience, up to three “Zorbonauts” are allowed into a single orb unrestrained, accompanied by three gallons of water (cool in the summer and warm in the winter) before heading down the mountain at up to speeds of 50 mph.\n\nSnowshoeing is another sport for the physically fit, allowing you to explore off the beaten path. Most excursions are taken with an experienced guide. Dogsledding abounds throughout most of the ski resorts in Switzerland. You can get information on local runs at the various tourist offices. Other snow sports include snowboarding and mono-skiing (parabolic skiing), which is much like snowboarding (you use a single, wide ski and your feet are side-by-side). This sport is most popular in the areas of Les Diablerets, Saas-Fee and Laax. World Cup events are held in these three areas every year. Snow biking or snow-bobbing are also popular (basically cycling on snow). Ice sports include ice hockey, curling, and luge.\n\nSummer Sports Cycling, hiking, swimming and skating are all popular in Switzerland. In the last five years Switzerland has initiated a number of in-line skating routes of 124 miles (200 km) each. The most popular are those from Geneva to Brig, from Zürich to Yverdon-les-Bains, and from Bad Ragaz to Schaffhausen. You can rent bikes at nearly every major train station, and cycling shops are abundant throughout Switzerland. You can arrange for a bike prior to your trip at www.rent-a-bike.ch. Prices vary, but they average around 25Sfr daily, and all types of bikes are available, from simple models to 21-gear mountain bikes. Hiking is the number-one recreational activity here. Trails are well marked and are color-coded to indicate levels of difficulty. For instance, bright gold signifies that a trail has suitable paths for all levels of hikers.\n\nIntroduction\n\na\n\n18 Travel on a Budget\n\nBergweg (mountain way) path signs are white-red-white and are for experienced mountain walkers.

Nowhere is Switzerland more epitomized than in the wonderful, auto-less Alpine village of Zermatt, home to some of the world’s most spectacular mountains, including the mighty Matterhorn. For this edition, I’ve added quite a few hikes you can take from Zermatt up to the small Matterhorn and vice versa. The Gornergrat-Bahn takes you up to a plateau at 10,171 feet (3,100 m) near the Matterhorn, where you will have fine views of the peak.

The Brienz Rothorn Bahn gives you a breathtaking panoramic view of the Bernese Alps on a wonderful old steam locomotive. The three-hour ascent peaks at the summit of Rothorn – 7,700 feet (2,350 m). In Canton Bern. See pages 387ff. Gruyères is a beautiful medieval village overlooking the crest of a small mountain just south of Bern and north of Lake Geneva. Here you can sample the rich cheese, quiche and fondue, of course. In Canton Fribourg. See pages 486ff. To get to the highest train station in Europe, you need to ride a series of trains and trams to the Jungfraujoch, which sits just 300 feet (92 m) below the summit of the Jungfrau. Up here one finds an ice palace carved into the glacier, dog-sled rides, shops and restaurants. In Canton Bern. See page 382. Saas-Fee is at the end of the Saas Valley, on the west side. At the fork in the road if you went east, you’d be heading to Zermatt. Saas-Fee is in the middle of 12 mountains, sitting atop a terrace high above the valley. The village is closed to traffic, and all cars must be parked at the edge of town in a parking garage. This is the town for hikers. It is where the Swiss go when they want to hike or ski. In Canton Valais. See pages 525ff.\n\n32 20 Places You Must See\n\nLugano, with its heavy Italian influences, is another must-see part of your journey, along with Zermatt and Lucerne. The streets of the Old Town are closed to cars, making this a great walking city. You can also take one of the many steamers for a couple of hours or for an all-day journey on beautiful and relaxing Lake Lugano. This is a great romantic spot for couples. In Canton Ticino. See pages 533ff. Geneva, though modernized, retains the charm of old Switzerland, particularly in the Old Town, where strolling along the maze of cobblestone walkways seems idyllic. Also, Geneva is a good spot if you’re looking for fun day-trips. There are a handful of tiny artisansplashed villages on the French side of Lake Geneva, which are worth exploring for an afternoon. Yvoire (pronounced EVE-wa) is one such spot that should not be missed. See pages 412ff. Appenzell is very popular with tourists, and for good reason – in no other Swiss town does Geneva’s Jet d’Eau (Nikolai Schwerg) folklore ring out so strongly. The buildings in this small village are painted with bright landscapes, flowers, people, animals and designs of all sizes and shapes. In addition, the town is known for its great cheeses and exquisite embroidery. In Canton Appenzeller Innerholden. See pages 98ff. The Glacier Express is more of a must-do, rather than a mustsee, although you will see quite a lot on this 7½-hour journey through some of the most treacherous mountain passes Switzerland has to offer. This train crosses 170 miles (274 km), passing from southeast Switzerland to the eastern part of the country – beginning in Zermatt and ending in St. Moritz – crossing some 291 bridges and moving through 91 tunnels. The\n\nSwiss Hotel Terms 33\n\ntrains are very modern and come complete with dining cars and large windows to view the spectacular scenery. See pages 155-56. The Engadine Region is enclosed by beautiful mountain ranges and highlighted by the wintersports resort of St. M o r i t z . In l o w e r Engadine is where you will find heavily forested valleys and the Swiss National Park – a 55-mile The Glacier Express (Janter) wildlife sanctuary that is a haven for hikers and wanderers.

It is a region known both for its sophisti- n Canton Appenzell Innerrhoden 97 cation (in Zürich) and for its ultra-traditional side (Appenzell). Since many visitors arrive in Zürich, at the main airport or train station, this can often be a good starting point from which to see the region, either via car or bahn (German for train). Except for the cities of Zürich and Appenzell, the region is often overlooked by foreign tourists. For instance, Canton Thurgau lacks the industrial development that plagues a good part of Canton Zürich. Here you find fruit groves, meadows and pastures that are great for relaxing walks or long hikes. The houses are half-timbered and many feature red beams that enrich the glow of stone walls.\n\nN\n\n36 Zürich & the Northeast\n\nCanton Schaffhausen, which sits to the north of Zürich, often seems more a part of Germany than of Switzerland. With its picturesque villages along the Rhine River, Schaffhausen boasts one of Europe’s finest natural wonders – the spectacular Rhine Falls. It is also the home of some lovely vineyards. Farther east lies the canton of St. Gallen, with the half-cantons of the Appenzells firmly entrenched within it. These cantons offer more of the refreshing Swiss countryside – gently rolling hills, the clanging of cow bells from afar, and small farms dotted throughout the land. Here, you find men and women sporting traditional Appenzeller costumes of red vests, black pants and ornate embroidery work. Along the far eastern and northeastern edges of the area is Lake Constance or the Bodensee as it is known in German. With its gentle mountain slopes and crystal blue waters, relaxing shipboard excursions and walks are popular here.\n\nShip on the Bodensee (Bene16)\n\nFor a pleasant five- to seven-day trip through this region, we recommend using the city of Zürich as your base. If you’re driving or traveling by train, you’re only a short distance from most destinations here. After several days exploring Zürich, you can travel north (on Highway 1) and spend an afternoon in the artsy city of Winterthur, before heading north (along Highway 4) to Schaffhausen, where we suggest an overnight stay.\n\n37\n\nZürich & the Northeast\n\n38 At a Glance\n\nYou can then travel via secondary road or rail to Kreuzlingen, along the shores of Lake Constance for half a day, continuing onward to the lakeside village of Arbon. Better yet, take one of the many ship excursions available from Kreuzlingen. You can cross the lake and spend the rest of your day in Germany or simply sail on the lake, enjoying the tranquil waters and lovely scenery. From Kreuzlingen or Arbon you can head south to St. Gallen for another overnight stay and spend a day exploring this city and its surrounding villages. From here, it’s a short hop to Appenzeller land and Mt. Santis, where we suggest another overnight stay. Then travel west along Road 8 to Jona, a village on Lake Zürich. From there, you can take a ship back to Zürich.\n\nCanton Zürich (ZH) At a Glance n the far north of Switzerland, Canton Zürich has been a member of the Swiss Federation since 1351 and is home to 1.4 million people. With German as the primary language, this canton is dominated by the capital, “Stadt Zürich,” which is also the largest town in Switzerland, with approximately 366,809 residents.\n\nI\n\nStadt Zürich ürich is Switzerland’s most populous city and is famous as the intellectual and cultural capital of the nation. In 1916, the Dada movement emerged from Cabaret Voltaire, at nearly the same time when Lenin and Trotsky were running around in the city. Set 1,200 feet (400 m) above sea level, Zürich straddles the Limmat River at the south end of the city, which is home to 1,030 fountains. The old town contains most of the major sights, including 16th- and 17th-century houses, guildhalls, courtyards and innumerable winding alleyways.\n\nZ\n\nInformation Sources 39\n\nInformation Sources Tourist Offices\n\nPost Offices The main post office, the Sihlpost, is open Monday-Friday, 6:30 am-10:30 pm, Saturday, 6:30 am-8 pm, and Sunday, 11 am-10:30 pm, at Kasernenstrasse 95-99 CH-8023 Zürich. % 44-296-2111.

In addition to mountains, there are several beaches along the shores of Lake Zürich. These – the Strandbad Mythenquai and the Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen – are generally open from May through August. Besides sunbathing, you can also rent boats to take on the lake from the numerous ven-\n\n46 Stadt Zürich\n\ndors lined up along Limmatquai, Stadthausquai and Seequai. Prices vary and are negotiable. A public pool is at Sihlstrasse 71, and includes a sauna as well as outside pools. You can also take a boat trip from Zürich and visit some local lakeside villages.

The south side of this canton backs up against Canton Zürich along the Rhine river, while the rest shares the outer border of Switzerland with Germany. Schaffhausen joined Switzerland in 1501, and retains a great deal of its medieval charm even today. Over the years Schaffhausen has become known as a center of high trade and industry, brought about by 19th-century hydroelectric expansion within the city. However, 45% of this canton is still used for agricultural purposes, despite the high level of industry here, which remains fairly concentrated. This canton also has one of the highest rates of foreigners living within its borders, as a large number of asylum seekers – primarily Sri Lankan immigrants – have migrated here. Schaffhausen is also the only canton in Switzerland to have experienced bombing during the Second World War. On April 1, 1944 nearly 100 citizens of the town of Schaffhausen were accidentally killed by Allied bombers who mistook the area as a German target. Less than one year later, on February 22, 1945,\n\nS\n\nZürich & the Northeast\n\n58 Schaffhausen\n\n16 people in Schaffhausen and nine in Stein-am-Rein were also killed in a similar bombing expedition. Some historians have theorized that the bombings were not mistakes, and were in response to Schaffhausen munitions factories supplying arms to the nearby Nazis. This theory, however, has yet to be proven, and records are still sealed regarding these events.\n\nSchaffhausen chaffhausen is the capital of the canton of the same name, and is a busy modern town outside of its medieval city center. For years it has acted as a bridge between Switzerland and Germany, exporting and importing products. Goethe was a frequent visitor to Schaffhausen in the late 1700s, and he reportedly remarked that the inhabitants must be “very curious folk,” due to the great number of peep-holes that can be found throughout the city. As a result, Schaffhausen was nicknamed Erkerstadt or the “City of Dormer Windows.” The city is 32 miles north of Zurich and just 17 miles north of Winterthur.\n\nS\n\nInformation Sources Tourist Office This is directly underneath the city’s big clock tower, on Fronwagplatz 4, just one block east of the train station.

The Schaffhausen Tourist Office can provide you with free maps of hiking and biking trails, and boat excursion information.\n\n60 Schaffhausen\n\nAdventures On Foot No visit to Schaffhausen would be complete without a hike to the Rhinefalls. As Europe’s largest and most powerful waterfall, it falls from a height of 70 feet (21 m) and reaches its highest flow during the month of July. The scenery around the falls is spectacular, with green forests and mist that arises from the grassy river banks below. To get there, walk 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from Schaffhausen to Neuhausen city center, where signs will guide you to the falls, just a quick five-minute walk away. There are walking trails all around the falls, but in summer this area is overrun with tourists and souvenir vendors, so late fall or early spring are great alternatives. You can also take a boat ride (in June, July and August from 10 am-6 pm, and in May and September from 11 am-5 pm) to the Rhinefalls (Reinhard Kraasch) rock in the middle of the stream near the falls. You can climb up the rock to gain an even more impressive view of the Rhinefalls. Contact Verkehrsverein at Industriestrasse 39, CH-8212 Neuhausen am Rheinfall. % 52-672-7455.

The Munot fortress itself dates from 1564 (it was built after writer Albrecht Dürer published a Munot battlements (Benjamin Isler & Simon Stelling) book in 1527 in Nürnberg describing such a place) and has a covered foot-\n\n62 Schaffhausen\n\nbridge across a moat, a tower, a spiral ramp inside (one of only three in Europe) and a circular viewing platform. Admission is free to the Munot, which is open daily from May to September, 9 am-8 pm, and from October to April, 10 am-5 pm. Fronwagplatz is the city center’s long square, and here sit two distinguished medieval fountains – the Metzgerbrunnen and the Mohrenbrunnen. The former was built in 1524 and the statue that sits atop it is of a Swiss mercenary, while the latter was built 11 years later in 1535 and features a Moorish king.\n\nChurches Münster zu Allerheiligen, or Cathedral of All Saints, is one of the highlights of the Altstadt, dating back to 1049 (the original building was later replaced with the current structure in 1103). The Romanesque church tower and Münster zu Allerheiligen the adjoining Gothic cloister (the largest in Switzerland) are open Tuesday-Sunday from 10 am-noon, 2-5 pm. Outside of the cathedral wall is the circular path around the Junkernfriedhof (nobleman’s cemetery). In the courtyard is the 1486 Schiller Bell. Legend has it that this gigantic ringer inspired German poet Friedrich Schiller to write his Song of the Clock. However, Schiller never was in or even near Schaffhausen, leaving one to ponder why his name was connected to the bell in the first place.\n\nLandmarks & Historic Sites The Zum Ochsen House (at Vorstadt 17) features a striking Renaissance fresco, along with a five-paneled dormer window. Formerly a Gothic inn, the building was remodeled in 1608. The panels pay tribute to the five senses and show a woman holding a cake, a flower, a glove, a mirror and a medieval stringed instrument. Walk north from the Zum Ochsen House, past the\n\nWhere to Stay 63\n\nZum Grossen Kafig House (at Vorstadt 43) to the Schwabentor – the northern gate of the city. This tower was built in 1370, and during renovations in 1933 a plaque was added that shows a boy holding a pig under his arm while trying to avoid traffic, and the Haus zum Ritter (S. Wenner) inscription: “Lappi tue d’Augen uf,” which means “Silly people keep your eyes open.” This was in reference to the traffic that had become heavy during those years as Schaffhausen grew into a more industrialized city. The Haus zum Ritter dates from 1485. The façade was painted by Tobias Stimmler in 1568-70, but was heavily damaged and was removed in 1935. The current façade is a replacement from 1943.\n\nWhere to Stay Rheinhotel Fischerzunft is an ultramodern hotel with unique charm and an excellent restaurant known throughout Europe.
