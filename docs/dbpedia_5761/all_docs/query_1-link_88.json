        "text": "SHOPTALK: [Note: Both desktops feature Joseph’s Swift’s home in the hollow that bears his name. On my shop desk is a pic of the ruins. It is one of several I now have of the home. On my home desk is an architectural drawing of the home as it was to appear after it was built. Both are interesting images. And I thought them even more interesting when one sees them together.] From the outset I’ll make this as luculent as humanly possible. Swift’s Hollow, just south of Mill Hollow, is not haunted; there was no mean old man named “Gore” who ran an orphanage there; and no children died, or were buried, there after a fire or epidemic. What was there, however, was something so unusual and beautiful that photographs of it taken by an Elyrian, William Schiede, were once the focus of an architectural exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. It was called “Rosedale”.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 a Williamstown, Massachusetts man named Joseph Swift enlisted, and spent two years in the American military. Afterward the government gave him 150 acres in the Western Reserve territory for his troubles. The land was fertile river bottom very much suited for farming. It was nestled in a wooded hollow some 7 miles south of the mouth of the Vermilion River.\n\nHere Swift built a small home and got to the business of clearing the black walnut, cherry, whitewood, and oak trees to make room for crops. In short order his efforts were rewarded. Few ports on the lake were unfamiliar with Swift’s corn crops. Before long he purchased several hundred additional acres - including the high bluffs overlooking the hollow.\n\nIn addition to this the wealthy farmer also desired to have a house that would better reflect his good fortune. Work by Elyria carpenter/builder, Mr. Lang, began in 1840. It took two years to build. A New York architectural firm designed it. In architectural text books the house is eminent because it was a fine example of early American architecture called the “Greek Revival Phase” (1800-1850). Four ionic columns decorated at the top graced the front of the structure. They had been transported by barge canal from New York State. Two large French decorated windows in line with the four columns at opposite ends of the front of the house were separated by a 35 by 10-foot porch. In the center of the porch stood the front door with two windows on each side.\n\nThe quality of the interior was no less exceptional. The framing timber came from the surrounding woods and was cut at the mill in Mill Hollow. The Whitewood planing material came from the mill of a Mr. Stiles of Cleveland.\n\nAt the back of the house was a covered piazza with smooth stone flooring in (again) an “L” shape. Here a lush flower garden afforded a southern atmosphere to the colonial structure. At the front lay the wonderful rose garden which gave name to the Swift manse; Rosedale.\n\nAside from being an architectural wonder Rosedale also played an important role in the Underground Railroad during the American Civil War. The various barns about the property were used to quarter slaves awaiting passage to Canada in search of freedom.\n\nThe Swift Family sold the home in 1866 (VPJ 1-23-03). In 1901 the place was essentially abandoned. Then in the early 1920’s when folks were just about to restore the home it was destroyed by fire. And all that is left is the foundation and a few stones scattered about the ground...\"\n\nPublished in the Vermilion (Ohio) Photojournal on May 30th, 2005; Rev. 08/26/2019\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SLOW-LEARNER: The worst thing about installing a new computer is that it probably requires new, up-dated software. And new, up-dated software often means that installing and using the same requires learning how to us the software.\n\nNow I know this. But it never fails that I’m miffed when things don’t work the way I believe they should – as opposed to the way they do work.\n\nI won’t go into a long tale about how long it took me to figure out why I was unable to get the type tool in PS CC-2019 to work. I can only say that I had hair when I started.\n\nAfter a good night’s sleep I had a new hunch as to the problem and it took me less than 5 minutes to correct it.\n\nBut that is only one piece of software. Wait’ll I get to the rest.\n\nMORE: When I got to animating using this new (to me) PS software I had more learning to do. For most of this it is simply a matter of knowing where things are and what they’re now called. They work a little better, but are very similar to those I’ve been using for years.\n\nThank Heaven for YouTube.\n\nI might try some more advanced animations after we move into the colder months (during the projected “Polar Coaster”) – and there are fewer persons about town.\n\nHistorically,\n\nIT HAPPENED IN LATE MARY: of 1903. Linwood Park was about to open for the summer. Trot-line fishermen had been bringing in some good catches. Work on the construction of the new stove factory on the west side of town was moving along. The Twentieth Century Limited made a record run between Cleveland and Toledo passing through town in a blur. A.D. Baumhart was busy moving his drug store / insurance office on Division [now Main] street four doors north of Englebry’s Dry Goods Store [now Brummer’s Candy store]. The first picnic of the season was about to be held at Shadduck’s / Shattuck’s Grove [later Crystal Beach amusement park] on the coming Saturday. Local farmers had received just enough rain for their crops during the week. The Vermilion High School commencement was set for June 5th at the Township Hall Opera House. So, all in all, it looked like it was going to be another pleasant and busy summer season in the little village of Vermilion, O. when young Orville Brooks came home feeling a bit under the weather. The poor boy was running a fever; had a slight rash; and less than 24 hours later the whole town was on the brink of panic. Orville was found to have smallpox.\n\nTo digress momentarily, it might be helpful to understand that smallpox is a potentially fatal contagion that emerged in human populations thousands of years ago. Human beings are its only known natural hosts. It is generally spread by direct, prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected individual and / or direct contact with infected bodily fluids or objects contaminated by sufferers. The name is derived from the Latin word for “spotted” referring to the raised bumps that eventually appear on the face and body of the infected person. Thank heaven, and modern medicine, it has now been eradicated from our planet. The last known case is said to have been in Somalia in 1977.\n\nBut back to Vermilion in May and June of 1903. The residences of Brooks’s parents and grandparents were immediately quarantined and guarded. School was dismissed and the building was fumigated. By June 4th Commencement proceedings, church services, and all public gatherings were cancelled until further notice. As more persons came down with the disease a “Pest House”, a clinic for treating persons with contagious diseases, was set up somewhere along West River road. [Note: I first heard about the Pest House in a recorded conversation between late Vermilionite Betty Reffner and another late Vermilionite, Harvey Krapp, talking about his earliest memories of Vermilion. In that recording Mr. Krapp indicated that the clinic was located near a site that eventually became the site of the F.W. Wakefield Brass Company.]\n\nIn ensuing days every house in the village was fumigated and formaldehyde was being freely used. Inoculations for the virus were started immediately; and by June 5th Mayor Williams reported that there were not five persons left in the town who had not been vaccinated. Here it is interesting to observe that Vermilion’s good Dr. Bond refused a vaccination because he didn’t believe in them. He, consequently, did suffer with a mild attack of the disease, but did recover.\n\nBy mid-July the siege of smallpox was at an end. City leaders, responding to the immediate needs of residents, had had to borrow $1500 (which was a significant amount of money in those times) to address those needs. There had been four casualties: Orville Brooks; his sister Mabel; their uncle William; and a three-year-old boy named Myron Krapp. But five others; Ada and Ethel Brooks (Orville’s sisters), Mrs. Guy Davis, Ozzie Shaffer, and Henry Ries survived the ordeal. So, whatever the cost had been to stem the spread of the virus, it had been well worth it.\n\nOn August 1st a celebration was held at Shadduck’s Grove and Linwood Park. Everything was free. Two bands, one from North Amherst, and one from Norwalk, entertained town folks. And, in the true spirit of America, a baseball game was played. Who won that game in that yesteryear didn’t matter. What really mattered was that “the end of the scourge” in Vermilion had come, and the people were happy once again.\n\n[NOTE: This was a terrible disease. Naturally occurring smallpox was destroyed worldwide by 1980. Those of us who were vaccinated for smallpox may still have a scar on the upper arm.]\n\nRef: The Vermilion News, May to August 1903; Sandusky Evening Star, 6/05/, 6/20/; 7/18/1903; U.S. Census, 1870 and 1900; Published in the Vermilion Photojournal 06/16/2011; Rev. 08/24/2019.\n\nVol. XV, No 13 - VERMILION, OHIO THURSDAY, August 31, 1911 THE BAND REUNION\n\nVermilion has had a musical treat during the past two days and non-withstanding the rain of Monday and the cool weather a fair-sized crowd was here to enjoy it. Had the weather been more favorable, no doubt the crowd would have been very large. Unfortunately the committee had no control over this feature. The West Chardon band was the first to arrive coming at about 3 o’clock Tuesday afternoon, other bands kept coming in until some nine had been ordered. They were assigned to give concerts during the evening. These concerts were enjoyed by a large crowd. The Shelby band had made special arrangements for their concert put on an excellent program. The Attica band and several of the other bands gave good programs.\n\nIn the morning the bands continued to arrive until some fifteen were on hand when the parade was formed. This was rather disappointing to the committee that some ten or more had signified their intentions to come.\n\nThe parade started at 10:30 with 16 bands in line as follows: West Chardon, Attica, Steam Corners, Chatfield, Cairo, Marion, Shelby, Belleville, New Regal, Gibsonberg, Iler, Berlin Heights, Kipton, Clyde, Lucas, Vermilion.\n\nThe bands all presented a fine appearance and were hardly heartily applauded.\n\nThe Chardon band is out of the ordinary having five lady members and attracted considerable attention.\n\nIn the afternoon the mass concert was given. This was also very successful and well worth listening to. We are unable to tell the number of participants but believe it nearly 200. Eugene B Ackley, directed. The remainder of the day was taken up with concerts and other amusements.\n\nThe convention meeting was held in the hall shortly after the mass concert President Decker called to order. H. L. Minium gave a short address in place of Mayor Williams who was not present. Mr. Kneisel, the well-known blind pianist played two selections and the prizes were awarded. The result of the awards was as follows:\n\nIler band, $65.00, King trombone for placing the largest order for new King instruments.\n\nShelby band, $10 worth of music for band programming most Carl Fischer music.\n\nClyde band, pennant for presenting best appearance in appearance.\n\nShelby, pair ebony drumsticks for 2nd best appearance.\n\nClyde had the tallest drum major and won music publications by Ditson company.\n\nShelby band won the gold plated leaders baton for having largest number of Holton instruments.\n\nTyro, will receive $15 in music, having come longest distance.\n\nChardon took second with $10 worth of music in Belleville 3rd, $5.00 worth.\n\nClyde had the largest membership in the parade and received several musical publications from the Oliver Ditson company.\n\nFive bands had, 1 each, of King instruments, consequently the representative drew cuts resulting in Berlin Heights band receiving the $60.00 King trombone or cornet.\n\n&5.00 worth of music went to Clyde for largest number of reed instruments.\n\nPackage of music went to Chatfield having handsomest leader Mr. Layer.\n\nThe drum majors baton went to Iler, that band bringing a delegation of 85.\n\nThe Gibsonberg band had the largest number of cornets and parade and won a handsome music stand.\n\nWest Chardon band receive the Ebony baton, having five ladies in their band.\n\nT. G. Wettach, of Pittsburgh, Josef Narovic, of Cleveland and J. A. Burroughs of Vermilion were the judges.\n\nGibsonberg wanted the next convention but preferred to wait before deciding.\n\nAfter the meeting more concerts follow.\n\nThe water carnival was called off in part on account of the heavy sea but several of the smaller craft made a display upon the river and looked very nice.\n\nAt 8:15 Ackley’s band gave the best concert ever given in Vermilion. The music can be expressed by one word, GRAND. Jos. Grant of Sandusky gave a trombone solo and encoured. Prof. Hezltt sang a fine selection and gave “My Hero” from Chocolate Soldier as an encore.\n\nProf. Joseph Naroves of Cleveland gave clarinet solo. He is one of the most accomplished players in the country and his solo was heartily applauded. Director Ackley will feel proud of this concert and feel that the audience thoroughly enjoyed this music feast. This concert ended the program of the meet and the committee can rest assured that their efforts at and entertaining the bandss and visitors are appreciated by those who realize now how hard they have labored to make the affair a success.\n\nThe main streets of the town were decorated tastefully as well as a number of business houses.\n\nKilled on The Nickel Plate Ry.\n\nSimon Putriski, 12 and Tony Samilaisti, 11, two Polish boys of Lorain came to Vermilion on a Nickel Plate freight and after visiting several orchards and vineyards near the track started on their return trip walking the track. They were partway across the trestle when a work train ran them down. Young Putriski put the basket over his head and lay down between the rails. The engine and three or four cars passed over when he raised his head and was struck by a brake beam. Death was instantaneous. The body was badly mutilated. It was taken to Beeckel’s undertaking rooms and later shipped to Lorain. Young Samilaisti escaped by running. According to Lorain News Mrs. Petriski the boy’s mother stated through an interpreter that the boys left soon after dinner for the purpose of stealing grapes.\n\nSchool Begins Tuesday\n\nThe following teachers have been secured for the Township schools:\n\nSub.

Houser who has not as yet reported name to the clerk of board.\n\nAccidentally Shot\n\nPhilip Hahn lost a good horse as a result of the strange accident Friday he was plowing when he heard a shot. He paid no attention until he noticed that one of his horses acted queerly. He took it to the stable and it dropped dead. Examination showed a bullet hole in its breast. Who the party was who fired the shot is surmised.\n\nMrs. Merdenger, age 84, of Cleveland died Thursday evening at the home of B. O. Crosier west of town, where she had been boarding since June 23. Tuesday, Mrs. Merdenger received word of the death of her only son in Chicago. She took to her bed that afternoon. She was the mother of Mrs. Herbert Loomis, who is quite well known in this vicinity. Mr. and Mrs. Loomis were called from stony Lake Can. where they have been spending the summer took charge of the body which was placed in a vault at Lakeview Cemetery, Cleveland on Monday. The burial will take place early in October.\n\nWOMAN ARRESTED L. S. E. Detectives Think They Have Party Who Tried to Wreck Car.\n\nMary Ermer, 19, Dover Bay is charged by detectives of the Lake Shore Electric railroad with attempting to wreck interurban cars near her home during the last few weeks.\n\nShe is said to have placed ties and rails on the tracks. Several bad accidents were narrowly avoided.\n\nA warrant was sworn out in the Cleveland probate court late Friday for Miss Ermer’s arrest on an insanity charge. She was released from the State Hospital July 15, after being treated for two years.\n\nDetectives, working on the case, were in probate court Saturday to testify in the insanity inquest.\n\nThree unsuccessful attempts to wreck Lake Shore electric cars have been made within a year, the last on August 13, when four ties were staked to the track between stops 7 and 9, near Hahn’s Grove.\n\nMotorman Jolly, on a car going the opposite direction, saw the obstruction and flagged the car containing 60 passengers, which would have struck at full speed.
