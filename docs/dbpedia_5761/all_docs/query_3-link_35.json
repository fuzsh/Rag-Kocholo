        "text": "A comparison of the aquatic impacts of large hydro and small hydro projects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaylor, Lara A.\n\nThe expansion of small hydro development in British Columbia has raised concerns surrounding the effects of these projects, and the provincial government's decision to proceed with Site C has brought attention to the impacts of large hydro. Together, these decisions highlight that there are impacts associated with all energy development. My study examines the aquatic effects of large and small hydro projects using two case study sites: Site C and the Upper Harrison Water Power Project. I first determine the aquatic effects of each of the case study sites. Next, I use existing literature and benefits transfer to determine the monetary value of these effects. My results suggest that, with mitigation, small hydro projects have less of an effect on the environment than a large hydro project per unit of electricity. I also describe the implications of my study in the context of current British Columbia energy policy. Keywords: hydropower; aquatic effects. Subject Terms: environmental impact assessment; benefits transfer.\n\nThe Nothuesli small hydro project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBalachandran, S.; Jorde, K.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) discusses the project for a small 16-kilowatt hydro plant on the Gonzenbaechli stream in eastern Switzerland. The site, which was used even before 1860 for obtaining power from the stream is briefly described, as are the present remains of earlier installations. An old Francis turbine has been retrieved and could possibly be reused. Water-flow figures and fall-heights are noted. Design flows and residual water quantities required by legislation are noted and discussed, as are the geology and topology of the catchment area. The proposals for a new hydro-power plant are described, including the apparatus proposed with a power of 20 kVA. Environmental aspects are also discussed, as are the investment costs and the economic viability of the project. The paper is completed with a comprehensive appendix, including detailed cost estimates.\n\nFinancing options for small hydro projects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShepherd, J.C.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nExamples and techniques used to enhance the ability to finance small hydro projects, or to finance them in non-standard ways, were discussed. It was suggested that factors that motivate investors, namely the maximization of the rate of return on capital, and minimization of risk, should be the primary concern for any would-be developer. A responsible, conservative approach to financial projections was recommended as the best to impress potential investors\n\nFouling in small hydro projects; Verschmutzung von Kleinwasserkraftwerken - Schlussbericht\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAbgottspon, A.; Staubli, T.\n\n2010-03-15\n\nThis comprehensive final report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) takes a look at fouling problems encountered in small hydro installations. The report is based on ten interviews made with operators of small hydro power stations in Switzerland. A parallel project carried out in Germany is mentioned. A large variation in the degree of fouling in the various hydro power stations is noted. Sources such as leaves in autumn and algae are discussed, as are the various rinsing procedures used to clear the turbines of fouling. Power losses are discussed and measures that can be taken to prevent fouling are described. Measurements made at an installation in Freienstein, Switzerland, are presented and discussed. The report is completed with an appendix containing calculations, details on the Freienstein power plant and the results of interviews made with the ten hydro power installations examined.\n\nSmall hydro\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBennett, K.; Tung, T.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA small hydro plant in Canada is defined as any project between 1 MW and 15 MW but the international standard is 10 MW. The global market for small hydro development was considered good. There are some 1000 to 2000 MW of generating capacity being added each year. In Canada, growth potential is considered small, primarily in remote areas, but significant growth is anticipated in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. Canada with its expertise in engineering, manufacturing and development is considered to have a good chance to take advantage of these growing markets\n\nThe Nothuesli small hydro project; Wasserkraftwerk Nothuesli, Gonzenbaechli - Vorprojekt\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBalachandran, S.; Jorde, K.\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) discusses the project for a small 16-kilowatt hydro plant on the Gonzenbaechli stream in eastern Switzerland.

Encouraged by legislation, and the Valoren community programme (which defined investment incentives), many new small hydro projects sprang up in Portugal in the 1990s. In some areas of Portugal the water levels were higher than the urban centres where the water is required: how the problems of integrating power and water were addressed is described. The integration of power and irrigation schemes is also mentioned. In the wake of great expansion in the Portuguese hydro industry, there was a sharp reduction (in 1995-6) and the reasons for that are listed. The 1999 tariff was such that it is likely that small hydro will provide 3.8% of the electric power consumed nationally by 2010\n\nVaksvikelva small hydro\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLoe, Daniel Aarset\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNorway is in constant need of renewable energy, and hydroelectric power is still the main source. A great future potential can be found in countless small rivers scattered across the country, which could be developed through small hydro projects. In the process of converting mechanical movement - flowing water - into electric energy, about 5% turns into heat. From a power plant with an annual production of 15 GWh, this means energy enough to heat approximately 30 households is lost. In my pro...\n\nAnalyze the factors effecting the development of hydro power projects in hydro rich regions of India\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAmeesh Kumar Sharma\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Power is considered as the major back bone for all the nations throughout the world including India on the basis of which development of the country depends. If a country has the resources to generate the power at competitive price in that case the people of the country get the benefits in terms of improvement in their social and economical life. When we talk about India, various locations in the country where still there is no electricity people are living in dark without having the access of the modern technology. The total hydro power potential of India is 1, 50,000Â MW out of this total hydro potential only 40,195Â MW is exploited till 2014. More than 80% of the total hydro potential of the country is lying in the western Himalayan states (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. Small hydro projects are also playing a very important role in the modern world for the development of the remote areas which are not main grid connected specially in western Himalayan region of India. India has a total potential 19,749Â MW of small hydro projects and of this total potential only 3990.9Â MW harnessed till 2014. Ministry of new and renewable energy in India is also providing special incentives to hydro rich states of India. In this research article we are taken the case study of the small hydro projects in the western Himalayan region because theses states are having vast small hydro potential which is still needed to be harnessed. So, it is very important to identify the factors which are effecting the development of these small ventures especially in western Himalayan region in India.\n\nSmall hydro plant- present scenario and future prospects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPurohit, D.P.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe article, deals with the methodology of power generation by small hydro power resources, especially in the Himalayan and sub Himalayan regions and the benefits it will bestow to the inhabitants of this region. The development of small hydro power projects in the Himalayas and sub Himalayas would serve as a model for environment- friendly sources of energy to benefit small communities world wide. The use of water turbine generators for the generation of cheaper power is also discussed. 4 refs\n\nFrom concept to construction: a 15 MW small hydro project\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nStephens, S.; Neegan, K.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nAn audio recording of an address by Chief Stanley Stephens and Deputy-Chief Ken Neegan of the Constance Lake First Nation, at the Renewable Energy Commercial Trade Show and Markets Conference was presented. The speech concerned development of a 15 MW hydro project on the reservation. Stephens recalled how initial opposition was overcome by addressing simple misconceptions about the project. The project was initiated by the Ontario Energy Corporation with a series of community discussions which addressed environmental impacts, and benefits that would result from the project. Neegan explained that after deliberation and negotiations, the Constance Lake First Nation was pleased with the project. This project was evidence that sound partnership could be formed between First Nations and hydro developers, while preserving respect for `Mother Earth` in the process. Trust between the community, the developers and government was considered to be the critical component of the project. Sound legal, technical, environmental and financial information was also indispensable in allowing the Constance Lake First Nation to make its decision to proceed with the project.\n\nFrom concept to construction: a 15 MW small hydro project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStephens, S.; Neegan, K.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nAn audio recording of an address by Chief Stanley Stephens and Deputy-Chief Ken Neegan of the Constance Lake First Nation, at the Renewable Energy Commercial Trade Show and Markets Conference was presented.

Partly as a response to this, a large number of applications for the development of smallscale hydro power projects up to 10 MW overflow the Water Resources and Energy Directorate, resulting in an extensive development of small tributaries and water courses in Norway. This study has developed a framework for the assessment and comparison of several small versus many large hydro-power projects based on a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach, and further tested this approach on planned or developed projects in the Helgeland region, Norway. Multi-criteria analysis is a decision-support tool aimed at providing a systematic approach for the comparison of various alternatives with often non-commensurable and conflicting attributes. At the same time, the technique enables complex problems and various alternatives to be assessed in a transparent and simple way. The MCA-software was in our case equipped with 2 overall criteria (objectives) with a number of sub criteria; Production with sub-criteria like volume of energy production, installed effect, storage capacity and economical profit; Environmental impacts with sub-criteria like fishing interests, biodiversity, protection of unexploited nature The data used in the case study is based on the planned development of Vefsna (large project) with the energy/effect production estimated and the environmental impacts identified as part of the feasibility studies (the project never reached the authorities' licensing system with a formal EIA). The small-scale hydro-power projects used for comparison are based on realized projects in the Helgeland region and a number of proposed projects, up scaled to the size of the proposed Vefsna-development. The results from the study indicate that a large number of small-scale hydro-power projects need to be implemented in order to balance the volume of produced electricity/effect from one\n\nNew markets for small-scale hydro\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMaurer, E.A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe market for small and medium sized hydro-electric power plant is more attractive than ever. The boom in Europe has increasingly spread to the emerging countries, and here too small hydro plays an important ecological role. In addition to new plant rehabilitation of 'historical' plant is now a major factor. The last few years have seen a market shift from single machine components to complete plant and systems, requiring a strategy re-think on the part of larger companies. Following the influx of private capital into the power industry, business conditions have also undergone a thorough transformation. In place of 'fast money', hydro power offers the prospect of earning longer-term, sustainable money'. The term small-scale hydro-electric power (or simply 'small hydro') is used slightly differently depending on the country and market. Here, it is used to denote plant with turbines up to 10 MW. (Author)\n\nA case study of small hydro and grid extension for rural electrification alternatives and complementarities\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTebicke, H.L.; Mariam, H.G.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThis paper reports that rural electrification in Eastern and Southern African Countries (ESAC) has so far been based largely on stand-alone diesel electric generating plant or on the extension of high-voltage transmission grids fed by large hydro and/or thermal electric generating stations. The alternative of furnishing supply at modest investment and competitive cost from a nearby small- hydro plant has rarely been considered in those countries of the sub-region that have ample hydro-power resources. All countries in the sub-region (except Angola) import petroleum and/or petroleum product supplies, as well as all hardware for electricity supply and utilization. As a result, in most countries an acute shortage of foreign exchange severely hampers implementation of rural electrification schemes. This should turn attention increasingly to strategies which are less capital-intensive and less dependent on foreign exchange, such as small-hydro plants, where the resource is located near to rural demand. Increasing the local content of small-hydro project implementation has paid off in recent years, considerably reducing costs in a number of Asian and Latin American projects. Local contributions have taken the form of resource assessment at a particular site, design, construction works, and fabrication of relatively simple components of power plant such as hydraulic equipment, low pressure penstocks and gates, as well as simpler types of turbines (e.g., the Banki type). Inadequacy of indigenous technical capacity to make similar local contributions in the ESAC has meant that the few recent small-hydro projects have relied on importing both expertise and equipment. The high costs resulting have frequently fueled arguments against pursuit of small-hydro projects\n\nSmall hydro: Policy and potential in Spain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGutierrez, C.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn Spain, the benefits of small-scale (less than 10 MW) hydro are apparently rarely appreciated and there is little support from European institutions. The article suggests that small hydro technology can make a significant contribution to the country's energy requirements and create employment, provided certain obstacles can be removed. Data on the number of small hydros in Spain, and of recent installations are given; the share of hydro in Spain's total energy production is 2.5%. The low environmental impact of hydro is extolled, and the conclusions of a recent study of 'environmental impacts of the production of electricity' are listed. There are said to be unreasonable administrative obstacles; for example, it is more difficult to obtain permission to refurbish a 100 kW hydro plant in Castilla y Leon than it is to install a 30,000 kW gas plant. Some details relating to the affect of hydro on aquatic ecosystems, noise levels, and water quality, are given\n\nSmall steps for hydro\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWicke, Peter\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe government in Peru has decided to utilise its gas reserves and restrict hydro to relatively small schemes. A number of reasons for the decision are given. In 1997, the Shell-Mobile-Bechtel-COSAPI consortium was formed and agreements were signed regarding exploiting Gas de Camisea. The country's energy needs to 2010 are being assessed. It is likely that by 2001 the whole of south Peru will be receiving gas from Camisea. The Peru situation is discussed under the headings of (i) existing capacity, (ii) growing demands, (iii) a history of hydro in Peru, (iv) electrification and SHP and (v) outlook. The future for Peru's electric energy development is bright. While most of its new power capacity will come from natural gas, the small hydros also have a part to play. A stronger commitment of national and regional political authorities to consider supplies outside the big cities is said to be needed. (UK)\n\nSome impacts and mitigations for small hydro developments in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBuchanan, R.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nPotential adverse impacts of small hydro power plants were defined and some of the mitigative techniques that can be used to eliminate or alleviate these impacts were outlined. Potential adverse impacts involved in the construction of hydro projects were identified as those associated with construction of dams, borrow areas, access roads, powerhouses, canals, penstocks, and transmission lines. Fish passage and fish habitat maintenance were also among the major issues that confront most of the proposed small hydro projects in Newfoundland. Fish passage and habitat issues received particular attention in view of their obvious importance in a province where fishing is a way of life for large segments of the population. Major challenges included both upstream and downstream fish passage, and maintenance flows downstream of dams. Upstream migration could be facilitated by fishways. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was said to be more problematic, but could be addressed by strategies such as intake design, screens, bypasses, sluices, turbine selection, plant shutdowns at critical times and operation of turbines at peak efficiencies. 12 refs., 2 tabs\n\nBOT schemes as financial model of hydro power projects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrausam, A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nBuild-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes are the latest methods adopted in the developing infrastructure projects. This paper outlines the project financing through BOT schemes and briefly focuses on the factors particularly relevant to hydro power projects. Hydro power development provides not only the best way to produce electricity, it can also solve problems in different fields, such as navigation problems in case of run-of-the river plants, ground water management systems and flood control etc. This makes HPP projects not cheaper, but hydro energy is a clean and renewable energy and the hydro potential worldwide will play a major role to meet the increased demand in future. 5 figs\n\nBrigham City Hydro Generation Project\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAmmons, Tom B. [Energy Conservation Specialist, Port Ewen, NY (United States)\n\n2015-10-31\n\nBrigham City owns and operates its own municipal power system which currently includes several hydroelectric facilities. This project was to update the efficiency and capacity of current hydro production due to increased water flow demands that could pass through existing generation facilities. During 2006-2012, this project completed efficiency evaluation as it related to its main objective by completing a feasibility study, undergoing necessary City Council approvals and required federal environmental reviews. As a result of Phase 1 of the project, a feasibility study was conducted to determine feasibility of hydro and solar portions of the original proposal. The results indicated that the existing Hydro plant which was constructed in the 1960âs was running at approximately 77% efficiency or less. Brigham City proposes that the efficiency calculations be refined to determine the economic feasibility of improving or replacing the existing equipment with new high efficiency equipment design specifically for the site. Brigham City completed the Feasibility Assessment of this project, and determined that the Upper Hydro that supplies the main culinary water to the city was feasible to continue with. Brigham City Council provided their approval of feasibility assessmentâs results. The Upper Hydro Project include removal of the existing powerhouse equipment and controls and demolition of a section of concrete encased penstock, replacement of penstock just upstream of the turbine inlet, turbine bypass, turbine shut-off and bypass valves, turbine and generator package, control equipment, assembly, start-up, commissioning, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA), and the replacement of a section of conductors to the step-up transformer. Brigham City increased the existing 575 KW turbine and generator with an 825 KW turbine and generator. Following the results of the feasibility assessment Brigham City pursued required environmental reviews with the DOE and\n\nProjects for small hydro-power installations in the Canton of Uri, Switzerland; Kanton Uri. Projekte fuer Kleinwasserkraftwerke - Vorstudie\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2009-11-15\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) on a preliminary study presents and discusses small-hydro projects at three locations in the Swiss Canton of Uri. Three of originally six potential locations were selected for further investigation. Factors such as the usable quantities of water available at the locations are discussed. The projects Brunnital, Gruonbach and Palanggenbach are discussed in detail. Water quantities and various components of the installations such as water intakes, de-sanding installations, pressure conduits, machine houses and tailrace channels are described, as is the electro-mechanical equipment proposed. Also, environmental aspects are dealt with. Annual electricity production and economic viability are further topics covered in the report.\n\nThe contribution of small hydro power stations to the electricity generation in Greece: Technical and economic considerations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKaldellis, J.K.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHydropower is the most widely used renewable energy source worldwide, contributing almost with 18.5% to the fulfillment of the planet electricity generation. However, most locations in Europe appropriate for the installation of large hydro power stations have already been exploited. Furthermore, there is a significant local communities' opposition towards new large power stations; hence, small hydro power stations remain one of the most attractive opportunities for further utilization of the available hydro potential. Greece and more precisely the country's mainland possesses a significant hydro-power potential which is up to now only partially exploited. In parallel, a large number of private investors have officially expressed their interest in creating small hydro power stations throughout the country, encouraged by the significant Greek State subsidy opportunities for renewable energy applications. However, up to now a relatively small number of projects have been realized, mainly due to decision-making problems, like the administrative bureaucracy, the absence of a rational national water resources management plan and the over-sizing of the proposed installations. Certainly, if the above problems are suitably treated, small hydro-power plants can be proved considerably profitable investments, contributing also remarkably to the national electricity balance and replacing heavy polluting lignite and imported oil. In the context of the above interesting issues, the present study reviews in detail the existing situation of small hydropower plants in Greece and investigates their future prospects as far as the energy, economic and environmental contribution are concerned\n\nDistributed power in Afghanistan: The Padisaw micro-hydro project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHallett, Michael\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe provision of electricity is a vital need in reconstruction and development situations, like that in Afghanistan. Indeed, according to the Afghan government's Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS) the need for electricity featured in 80% of the Provincial Development Plans as a top priority. With the help of the International Community, the government of Afghanistan is attempting to develop a new market oriented approach to the nationwide provision of electrical power. Although the bulk of the electrification effort is directed toward large scale construction of a national grid, the ANDS explicitly mentions a role for 'micro-hydro, solar, waste and small scale diesel power and energy generating sources'. This article will describe a micro-hydro project in Padisaw village, in the Nurgaram district of Nuristan province located in Northeastern Afghanistan and the role Provincial Reconstruction Team played in working with the local community through the project planning and building processes and offer some observation on how, as the Afghan National Development Strategy is executed, the private sector can play an increasingly significant role in the Afghan distributed energy arena.

[Celio Engineering SA, Ambri (Switzerland)\n\n2009-01-15\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) takes a look at a project for the realisation of a small hydro-power plant in the municipality of Anzonico, southern Switzerland. The water of a small alpine stream is to be used for power generation and vineyard irrigation as well as for the creation of an additional water resource for fire fighting in this sensitive region. The report is foreseen to support the request for a water usage concession to the authorities of the Canton of Ticino. It presents details on the hydrological data for the river and the dimensioning of the installation. The hydrological installations and the turbine foreseen are described and discussed, as is the removal of river sediment. The electricity production expected is discussed, as is the economic viability of the project. Synergies exist with the local electricity utility that will renew and improve its power distribution and telecommunication system when the penstock will be mounted in the underground.\n\nSmall-scale hydro-power plant in Quinto - Preliminary project; Progetto minicentrale idroelettrica, Ri Secco - Quinto.

[Celio Engineering SA, Ambri (Switzerland)\n\n2009-06-15\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) takes a look at a project for the realisation of a small hydro-power plant on the alpine stream 'Ri Secco' in the municipality of Quinto, southern Switzerland. The Ri Secco partly flows in a steep canyon. The elevation difference of 810 or 620 m (depending on the location of the water deviation from the stream) is favorable to the installation of a small-scale high-head power plant. The report presents details on the hydrological data and the dimensioning of the installation. Several variants are considered, which also include two possible penstock diameters for each weir location. The electricity production expected is discussed, as is the economic viability of the project.\n\nParametric distribution approach for flow availability in small hydro potential analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAbdullah, Samizee; Basri, Mohd Juhari Mat; Jamaluddin, Zahrul Zamri; Azrulhisham, Engku Ahmad; Othman, Jamel\n\n2016-10-01\n\nSmall hydro system is one of the important sources of renewable energy and it has been recognized worldwide as clean energy sources. Small hydropower generation system uses the potential energy in flowing water to produce electricity is often questionable due to inconsistent and intermittent of power generated. Potential analysis of small hydro system which is mainly dependent on the availability of water requires the knowledge of water flow or stream flow distribution. This paper presented the possibility of applying Pearson system for stream flow availability distribution approximation in the small hydro system. By considering the stochastic nature of stream flow, the Pearson parametric distribution approximation was computed based on the significant characteristic of Pearson system applying direct correlation between the first four statistical moments of the distribution. The advantage of applying various statistical moments in small hydro potential analysis will have the ability to analyze the variation shapes of stream flow distribution.\n\nSmall hydro generation building block profile\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2003-01-01\n\nConcise business information on small hydro generation in British Columbia was presented in this document. It was noted that the steep terrain within the province and its abundant precipitation provides numerous opportunities for hydropower generation in British Columbia. The hydroelectric sector produces approximately 90 per cent of the electrical demand in the province. The document focusses on small hydro sites producing between 0.5 and 50 mega watts (MW) and not having large water storage. In the first section, an overview of the electricity sector in the province is provided. The following issues are examined in subsequent sections: land resources; infrastructure requirements; sales market; labour market; the regulatory regime; development factors; non-governmental aspects; investments and economics; the present status and future outlook of the industry; and, government revenue. Input-output tables were also provided. 22 refs., 5 tabs., 4 figs\n\nRebuilding the Chalberhoeni small hydro power station in Saanen, Switzerland; Chalberhoeni - Rapport Final\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCavin, G.

The first report presents data on the catchment area involved, available head, residual water quantities, installed power and annual production figures. Investments and operating costs are looked at. The second report describes the project and discusses regional planning aspects, hydrological basics and environmental issues in connection with the renewal project, including details on invertebrates found in the stream and their relevance to fishing and nature protection issues.\n\nUsing project management techniques in hydro-relicensing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDominie, D.; Richard, J.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis paper reports that to answer a pressing need for managing today's complex process and requirements of hydro relicensing, Central Maine Power Company has applied the principles of project management, including the use of computerized scheduling to its hydro relicensing efforts. This approach involves early inter-departmental cooperation in mapping out critical path scheduling by requiring the project team to: Outline the scope of the project in its entirety. Clarify and define components of the project. Quantify and categorize assumptions and dependencies. Identify constraints. The computer-generated schedule of this cooperative planning effort provides a graphic representation of the team's plan and become the focal point for refinements and adjustments necessary to complete an application on time. The use of project management techniques facilities team understanding of the realities and limitations in the relicensing process. These techniques encourage cooperative action, and use a solution-oriented process resulting in a product which can be a useful tool in communicating with resource agencies and regulators\n\n78 FR 71601 - KC Small Hydro LLC; Advanced Hydropower, Inc.; Notice of Preliminary Permit Application Accepted...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-11-29\n\n...

Brazil's energy sector is currently comprised of 45 per cent renewable energy. Brazil is the tenth largest energy producer in the world, with an installed capacity of 105.986 MW. Brazil currently has an estimated 258.410 MW of hydroelectric power potential. Small hydropower (SHP) plants in Brazil are defined as plants capable of producing up to 30 MW of power, with a reservoir area smaller than 12 km 2 . It is estimated that SHP plants will provide 5 per cent of Brazil's electrical supply by 2030. SHP plants in Brazil typically use Kaplan and Pelton hydraulic turbines, as well as Michell-Banki cross-flow turbines. Hydrokinetic turbine prototypes are also being designed at the Federal University of Brazil. Researchers are currently developing a diffuser enhancement design. However, there are currently no designs available that use peripheric generators. Researchers are currently investigating the design of fish-friendly turbines as well as mobile dams.

This escalation of commitment transcends both sectorial and national boundaries. Preeminent examples include controversial nuclear projects in the US, hydroelectric projects like the Three Gorges Dam in China, and transport projects like the Chunnel and the Concorde. In this article, the authors examine the experience of Hydro-Quebec with the Great Whale Project. They argue that Hydro-Quebec escalated its commitment even after serious questions emerged about its environmental impacts and economic feasibility, because of (1) its earlier success with large projects, (2) its engineering culture''s norms for consistency, and (3) its role in the government''s desire for economic and cultural autonomy. Finally, they discuss the changes that are necessary to break commitments to such projects\n\nLiquid assets: factors contributing to the development of small hydro in China\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPan, D.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe rapid growth of small hydro capacity in China is reviewed. At present, the annual generation from rural small hydropower in China equates with the saving of 44 million tonnes of coal, or the emission of 110 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Other environmental advantages such as a reduction in wood burning, reduced logging and therefore reduced soil erosion, are mentioned. Energy-starved China stood to gain much from the development of small hydro systems and government policy has been supportive in terms of relatively low tax rates and low interest loans. It is expected that due to the rapid economic growth in China, small-scale hydro will maintain its present level of development and continue to be promoted in a sound and rational manner.

Research Centre for Economic Development\n\n2007-04-15\n\nSmall hydro is a renewable source of energy that is economically and technically viable. This article described China's investment in small-scale hydroelectric power plants in 1,600 remote communities. Seventy per cent of China's small hydro power stations are concentrated in remote impoverished communities. These power stations provide electricity to 300 million people in China, where half of the territories, one third of the districts and towns, and one quarter of the population depend primarily on this energy source for their electricity needs. The first power station was built in the province of Yunnan in 1912, but the real development of small hydro occurred after 1950, and can be divided into three phases. Phase 1 occurred before 1980 when small hydro power stations concentrated on providing electricity for lighting in rural areas as well as for transforming agriculture and irrigation. For many decades following the foundation of the Republic of China, rural areas did not have access to electricity or had serious shortages of electricity. In order to ensure electricity in isolated and remote areas, the Chinese government requested that local authorities build and exploit small hydro where conditions were favourable, and this while respecting water resources. Phase 2 occurred between 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on improving the performance of small hydro power stations to include electricity provisions for local enterprises. During phase 2, small hydro became a tool for dynamic rural development for farmers to increase their revenues. The latest phase in small hydro development has also helped reduce poverty and develop local economies, but in addition, it plays a role in the long term protection of ecosystems, the environment and rural modernization. Today 660,000 people work for small power stations and most are employed locally. Replacing firewood with electricity has saved 130,000 hectares of forested land and helped protect ecosystems. Small\n\nRemote micro hydro\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n1985-03-01\n\nThe micro-hydro project, built on a small tributary of Cowley Creek, near Whitehorse, Yukon, is an important step in the development of alternative energy sources and in conserving expensive diesel fuel. In addition to demonstrating the technical aspects of harnessing water power, the project paved the way for easier regulatory procedures. The power will be generated by a 9 meter head and a 6 inch crossflow turbine. The 36 V DC power will be stored in three 12 V batteries and converted to ac on demand by a 3,800 watt inverter. The system will produce 1.6 kW or 14,016 kWh per year with a firm flow of 1.26 cfs. This is sufficient to supply electricity for household needs and a wood working shop. The project is expected to cost about $18,000 and is more economical than tying into the present grid system, or continuing to use a gasoline generator. An environmental study determined that any impact of the project on the stream would be negligible. It is expected that no other water users will be affected by the project. This pilot project in micro-hydro applications will serve as a good indicator of the viability of this form of alternate energy in the Yukon. The calculations comparing the micro-hydro and grid system indicate that the mico-hydro system is a viable source of inflation-proof power. Higher heads and larger flow resulting in ac generation in excess of 10 kW would yield much better returns than this project. 3 tabs.\n\nAn overview on small hydro in Brazil\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFilho, G.T.

[Stucky SA, Renens (Switzerland); Wagner, T. [Sigmaplan, Berne (Switzerland)\n\n2009-12-15\n\nThese four final illustrated reports for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) deal with various aspects of two small hydro projects on two affluents of the river Saane in Switzerland. The first report presents two variants for the enhancement of the existing Meielsgrund installation as well as a new, parallel installation. The catchment area involved, available head, residual water quantities, installed power and annual production figures are discussed. Investments, operating costs and financial viability are also looked at. The second report describes the project and discusses regional planning aspects, hydrological basics and environmental issues in connection with the renewal project, including details on invertebrates found in the stream and their relevance to fishing and nature protection issues. The third and fourth reports concern the Turbach small hydro installation. The topics discussed in these two reports are basically similar to those considered for the Meielsgrund installation.\n\nHydro-electric power project on the Toulnustouc River\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRochon, Y.; Morneau, J.; Lefebvre, G.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nHydro-Quebec has proposed the development of a hydro-electric power project on the Toulnustouc River, located between Saint-Anne Lake and Manic Reservoir. The work would involve the construction of a power generation plant of 526 MW, construction of a 77 m dam on the Toulnustouc River, 14 km downstream from the existing Lac-Saint-Anne dam, the creation of a new water expanse covering 22 square kilometers, the construction of an embankment, the strengthening of the existing Saint-Anne embankment, digging a 9.8 km gallery, and the construction of a flood spillway. This work would have consequences for three different sectors of the river: between the existing and the proposed dam, between the dam and the projected power plant, and between the power plant and the limit of the influence of the reservoir Manic-2. Hydro-Quebec would like the work to begin in July 2001, with the aim of having the plant in operation in 2005. The overall cost of the project is estimated at 600 million dollars. It is expected that the economic benefits for the region would be in the 211 million dollar range. An environmental assessment of the entire project was performed by Quebec Ministere de l'Environnement. The authors determined that the project was recognized as justified by the Ministere des Ressources Naturelles (Natural Resources Ministry) and concluded that the project was acceptable from an environmental point of view as long as six conditions were met. They touched on the construction of a flood spillway capable of evacuating 19 cubic meters per second at any time during the year, that water be evacuated downstream following a pre-determined debit that varies according to the time of year, monitoring of the brook trout population and its habitat, and environmental monitoring. 46 refs., 7 tabs., 2 figs., 1 annex\n\nSmall hydro takes stock of a dozen years of activity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLeutwiler, H.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis short article discusses a survey that takes stock of the investments made in small hydro schemes in Switzerland since 1985 and the structural changes in this area that have occurred.

[Atlin Tlingit Development Corp., Atlin, BC (Canada)\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThis presentation documented the step-by-step process by which the Atlin Hydro Project was developed. The Taku River Tlingit First Nation undertook the Atlin project as part of its vision for responsible resource management, sustainable economic development, and cultural revival. The Atlin Community Energy Plan involved an assessment of electricity demand, a 20-year demand projection, energy efficiency recommendations, and an assessment of power supply options such as wind towers, connection to the Yukon power grid, and hydro. The potential impact on fisheries, hydrology, wildlife habitat, roads and bridges, navigable waters and forests, existing rights, and First Nation archaeology were assessed, along with other factors such as hazards and flood control. A hydrology assessment of the Surprise-Pine Drainage Basin was undertaken, and stream-flow measurements were taken near the intake location on Pine Creek. The project comprises a discharge control structure and a fish ladder; an intake and weir on Pine Creek; a penstock pipeline from intake to powerhouse; a powerhouse with a 2.1 MW Pelton turbine generator and a switch yard; and a power line from the powerhouse to the interconnection with the existing grid. The impacts on fisheries, wildlife, and human movement are expected to be minimal. 28 figs., 3 tabs.\n\nReport of the special prosecutor: BC Hydro 'Raiwind' project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFraser, P. D. K.\n\n1999-10-01\n\nA special prosecutor has been appointed by the British Columbia Government to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in its investigation, and to render appropriate charging decisions in the matter of the circumstances surrounding the creation of IPC International Power Corporation (IPC) owned by a Mr. John N. Laxton, former Chairman of BC Hydro and his two children, and its joint venture with BC Hydro for the development of an international power project in Pakistan known as the Raiwind project. Of particular concerns were the conflict of interest breached by Mr. Laxton in loaning a substantial sum of money to a principal member of the Pakistani side of the joint venture, and by the former President and CEO of BC Hydro, Mr. John Sheehan, by his purchase of shares of IPC by a company owned by members of his family. In 1996 Mr. Sheehan's employment as President and CEO was terminated by BC Hydro for breaching internal conflict of interest guidelines and for failing to get approval from BC Hydro for the acquisition of IPC shares. Subsequently, Mr. Sheehan commenced an action against BC Hydro for wrongful dismissal, a claim which was upheld by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The focus of the special prosecutor's criminal investigation ultimately became the conduct of Mr. Laxton and whether a charge could or should be laid under Section 122 of the Criminal Code. The outcome of his investigation, which is discussed in this report, was that there was no substantial likelihood of conviction under the breach or trust provisions of Section 122 with respect to the indirect purchases by Mr. Laxton of shares in IPC. Nor was there any reason to believe that a personal loan made in high-risk circumstances could be a benefit or advantage to the lender. Furthermore, the loan cannot be causally related to any loss or financial harm to BC Hydro. In fact, it could be argued that Mr. Laxton's private decision to make the loan was of real assistance in ensuring that the\n\nSmall Hydropower - The comeback of small hydropower stations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNiederhaeusern, A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis issue of the 'Erneuerbare Energien' (renewable energies) magazine published by the Swiss Solar Energy Society takes a look at small hydropower projects in Switzerland. In a number of interviews and articles, various topics concerning small hydropower are dealt with. First of all, an interview with Bruno Guggisberg, previously responsible for small hydro at the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, examines the potential of small hydro and the various political, technical and economic influences on such projects. Further articles provide an overview of the various types of small hydro schemes, including power generation using height differences in drinking-water and wastewater installations. As far as the components of small hydro schemes are concerned, various types of turbines and further system components that are needed are examined. A further article takes a look at the small hydro market and the market players involved. Ecological aspects and research activities are discussed in further articles. In a second interview with Martin Boelli, presently responsible for small hydropower at the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, the unused potential for the use of hydropower in Switzerland is discussed. Examples of small-scale hydro schemes are examined and the support offered by the Small Hydropower Program is discussed. Finally the question is asked, if the small hydro market in Switzerland is overheated as a result of promotion schemes such as cost-covering remuneration for electricity from renewable energy sources.\n\nAn approach to the investment analysis of small and medium hydro-power plants\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nForouzbakhsh, F.; Hosseini, S.M.H.; Vakilian, M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHydro-power plants, as a part of infrastructure projects, play an important role in the economic-social development of countries.

These systems are used for domestic lighting, radio and, in some cases, televisions. The units are small, cheap and are usually installed and owned by a single family. Funding from the CDM could be utilised in order to reduce the cost of good quality equipment to provide low-income households living in isolated off-grid locations with an affordable and sustainable electricity supply which can meet their needs for lighting, educational, productive and recreational uses. Therefore research was needed to determine the level of carbon emission reductions resulting from their use. The successful acceptance by the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) of the methodology of establishing the benchmark developed during this project could then be used as a precedent by other project developers in the future, thus being of long-term support to the emerging family-hydro industry.

Dept. of Electrical Engineering\n\n2010-07-01\n\nAlthough India has approximately 150,000 megawatts of hydro potential, only a small portion is tapped. There is also significant untapped hydro potential in many developing countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Indonesia and regions in South America and Africa. Small-scale hydroelectric power systems with capacities of up to a few megawatts are eco-friendly and sustainable. They can be classified based on unit sizes as pico (u pto 10 kilowatts), micro (10-100 kilowatts) and mini (100 kilowatts to a few megawatts) hydro systems. Mini hydro systems are always grid connected while micro can be either grid connected or off grid. Pico is always off grid. In India, there are thousands of favorable sites in this range that should be tapped for distributed power generation to electrify local communities. This need is reflected by the global emphasis on distributed power generation as well as the Government of India's policy to promote this type of power generation. A working stand alone pico-hydro power generating system has been successfully installed in 5 sites in Karnataka. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the technical, managerial and economic feasibility of setting up small hydro projects in remote hilly areas of Karnataka, India and its positive environmental impact. The presentation discussed the site selection criteria; installed sites of pico hydro; system description; parts of the system; the electric load controller; types of electronic load controllers; and a description of the unit and control scheme. tabs., figs.\n\nAn approach to the investment analysis of small and medium hydro-power plants\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nForouzbakhsh, F.

While hydropower has substantially contributed to meeting China's renewable energy targets and providing clean energy to rural areas, the development of hydropower in China has been met with significant controversy. Ecologically, hydro projects alter the landscape, with potential impacts to the country's aquatic biodiversity. Over the past four decades in China, various mainstream opinions and misunderstandings have been presented concerning how to alleviate the negative impacts of hydro projects on aquatic ecosystems. This article reviews research concerning potential mitigation measures to enhance aquatic biodiversity conservation in hydro projects in China. Based on the academic attention such research has attracted, three technical measures for aquatic biodiversity conservation are considered: (1) fish passages, (2) restocking efforts and (3) river and lake renovations. This article provides a historical comparison of these three practices in China to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The article also reviews the relevant legislation, regulations and technical guidelines concerning China's hydro projects dating back to 1979. The dynamics in research, publications, and patents concerning these three mitigation measures are summarized to demonstrate their technological developments in the context of legislative and policy advances. Data were gathered through the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China. Based on the analysis provided, the article recommends an expansion of China's environmental certification system for hydro projects, more robust regional legislation to bolster the national framework, the cooperation between upstream and downstream conservation mechanisms, and better monitoring to determine the efficacy\n\nResettlement associated with hydro projects in China\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAnon.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe flow rates of Chinese rivers are subject to major seasonal fluctuations, and as a result large reservoirs have to be constructed for flood control, irrigation, and power generation.

Using pump as turbine (PAT) is an attractive, significant and cost-effective alternative. Pump manufacturers do not normally provide the characteristic curves of their pumps working as turbines. Therefore, choosing an appropriate Pump to work as a turbine is essential in implementing the small-hydro plants. In this paper, in order to find the best fitting method to choose a PAT, the results of a small-hydro plant implemented on the by-pass of a Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) in Urmia city in Iran are presented. Some of the prediction methods of Best Efficiency Point of PATs are derived.

Zhang; Adam Taylor\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe possibilities of generating electric power from relatively small hydro-electric sources in a large urban area is investigated. Two different aspects of hydro-electric sources have been studied: storm/waste water pipes in large multi-tenanted residential buildings and urban storm water discharge area (CSI area). The potential to generate from these sources has been investigated using a micro-turbine.

The project was focused on Snowdonia National Park, which was identified as a conflict area in the UK. The aim was to develop a strategy to overcome these conflicts locally through: improving the understanding of market actors, of the effects of SHP on the environment; improving dialogue between market actors; initiating collaboration to analyse the environmental impacts and test innovative technological measures for sensitive SHP development; Identifying successful environmental measures and assessing their suitability for transfer to other regions; raising the awareness of market actors, of the environmental benefits of SHP. The project in the UK was mirrored in 2 regions of Europe, under the EU Altener programme, and lessons learnt were shared between regions.

Picciotti\n\n2013-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Hydro-meteorological hazards like convective outbreaks leading to torrential rain and floods are among the most critical environmental issues world-wide. In that context weather radar observations have proven to be very useful in providing information on the spatial distribution of rainfall that can support early warning of floods. However, quantitative precipitation estimation by radar is subjected to many limitations and uncertainties. The use of dual-polarization at high frequency (i.e. X-band has proven particularly useful for mitigating some of the limitation of operational systems, by exploiting the benefit of easiness to transport and deploy and the high spatial and temporal resolution achievable at small antenna sizes. New developments on X-band dual-polarization technology in recent years have received the interest of scientific and operational communities in these systems. New enterprises are focusing on the advancement of cost-efficient mini-radar network technology, based on high-frequency (mainly X-band and low-power weather radar systems for weather monitoring and hydro-meteorological forecasting. Within the above context, the main objective of the HYDRORAD project was the development of an innovative mbox{integrated} decision support tool for weather monitoring and hydro-meteorological applications. The integrated system tool is based on a polarimetric X-band mini-radar network which is the core of the decision support tool, a novel radar products generator and a hydro-meteorological forecast modelling system that ingests mini-radar rainfall products to forecast precipitation and floods. The radar products generator includes algorithms for attenuation correction, hydrometeor classification, a vertical profile reflectivity correction, a new polarimetric rainfall estimators developed for mini-radar observations, and short-term nowcasting of convective cells. The hydro-meteorological modelling system includes the Mesoscale Model 5\n\nSmall hydro in Ukraine: To invest or not to invest?\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLoechen, Liv Arntzen\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe vast and unexploited renewable energy potential and the introduction of green tariffs in 2009 have made Ukraine an attractive location for investors within the renewable energy sector. The Green Tariff system offers developers and investors the highest feed-in tariffs in Eastern Europe, and thus far covers alternative energy production from biomass, biogas, wind power plants and hydropower plants. Ukraine has a history in both large- and small hydro production. Whereas the potential of the country's big rivers is now to a great extent exploited, this is not the case for the smaller watercourses. Ukraine is well endowed with small rivers, approximately 60,000 of which can be classified as 'very small'. Most of these are located in the western part of the country, near the Carpathian Mountains. However, despite the natural potential, foreign investors should be aware of the potential risks and hurdles. The country has a huge problem with corruption, and the process of obtaining licenses is not straight forward. On the whole, it can be worthwhile exploring the possibilities of small hydro production in Ukraine for those who can deal with a high level of risk and uncertainty. If not, one would be better advised to look for investment locations elsewhere.(auth)\n\nSmall-scale hydro-electric scheme in Roches, Switzerland\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHausmann, M.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe small hydropower plant (SHPP) project 'PCH Roches' is planned to be built in Roches, a small village located in the Jura region of the canton of Bern. The goal of this undertaking is to reactivate a site with hydro potential of the river Birs on a section that was already well exploited by some ancient SHPP (since 1953 or probably even earlier). Several modifications were performed on this plant over the years; not all contributed positively on its production figures. Following a transfer of the water rights in 1987, claims became loud against the owner to perform maintenance on the river banks and to modify the weir such that a free passage for the fishes will be granted. Those issues contributed to inflate a conflict which ended in the repeal of the water rights and a total plant shut down in 2001. The new project plans to reuse the existing pen stock and to carry out some refurbishing activities to grant security and better performance. The weir and the intake structure are also redesigned such that the water storage can be somewhat raised for normal operation; a weir gate will however allow to better discharge the river in flood situations. A new turbine house will be erected at the current location where the tail water pen stock rejoins the river. Hence, the existing old turbine house will be obsolete and the upper and lower pen stock sections are to be linked with each other. Limited by the existing pen stock size, the new plant is expected to produce some 50 kW power and 362,000 kWh/year. This represents an increase in energy generation of around 200% compared with the ancient SHPP. Gross head is 5.38 m, net head 4.12 m with a turbine flow of at least 1.6 m 3 /s. The expected energy sales price applicable to this project reaches about 0.17 CHF/kWh as per the current tariffs set by the grid owner. This project calls for the building of a state-of-the-art SHPP. It will avoid the total dismantling of the existing works to take place and allow the small\n\nDAILY SCHEDULING OF SMALL HYDRO POWER PLANTS DISPATCH WITH MODIFIED PARTICLES SWARM OPTIMIZATION\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSinvaldo Rodrigues Moreno\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a new approach for short-term hydro power scheduling of reservoirs using an algorithm-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO. PSO is a population-based algorithm designed to find good solutions to optimization problems, its characteristics have encouraged its adoption to tackle a variety of problems in different fields. In this paper the authors consider an optimization problem related to a daily scheduling of small hydro power dispatch. The goal is construct a feasible solution that maximize the cascade electricity production, following the environmental constraints and water balance. The paper proposes an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO algorithm, which takes advantage of simplicity and facility of implementation. The algorithm was successfully applied to the optimization of the daily schedule strategies of small hydro power plants, considering maximum water utilization and all constraints related to simultaneous water uses. Extensive computational tests and comparisons with other heuristics methods showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nRetrofitting the small-scale hydro power plant 'La Chocolatiere' in Echandens-Bussigny, Switzerland\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2008-05-01\n\nThis report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is a project study for the retrofitting of a small-scale hydro power plant installed on the River Venoge, between the communities of Echandens and Bussigny, western Switzerland. At this site, hydro power is used since the 18 th century. A permanent license to use at most 3 m 3 /s is available. The study concludes that the maximum flow rate of 6 m 3 /s would be more advantageous, implying a 35 cm higher dam on the river. Two turbines could then be installed, leading to the maximum electric power of 177 kW and the power production of 727,000 kWh/y. From the detailed inventory of the retrofitting work and the installation of the new turbines - including a new fish ladder according to the legislation in force - the authors conclude that electricity could be generated at a cost amounting to about CHF 0.24/kWh. It is recommended to request the modification of the water use license in order to be able to use up to 6 m 3 /s.\n\nElectronic Control Of Small Hydro-Generators Part II\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDiaz B, Pedro; Torres M, Carlos A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe present project arises for the Colombian population's necessity to overcome the underdevelopment, the poverty, the education and the level of life in rural areas of difficult access, for an economic rural electrification. The UIS, by means of the advisory committee of investigations of the ability of Physical-mechanical Sciences and the ability of Electricity and Electronic, it begins the process of developing in 1991 a study of economic and reliable control for the handling of small micro-centrals. Providing from electric power to the rural sector is a world problem, and have more than enough this some countries (China, Nepal, Peru, The islands of Papua, New Guinea), they have made investigations, outlining and building central micro controlled by microprocessor. The present study is developed with the objective of carrying out a load control that acts reliable and quickly. Traditionally they have been come using mechanical governors, which are those in charge of making the load control by means of valves that regulate the flow of water in the turbines, involving this way big retards characteristic of any mechanical control. In summary, the electronic governor of load presents on the mechanical governor, the advantage of acting to more speed and consequently to maintain stable the frequency of the system. To continue with the study, the objective that this project must develop, is an electronic control of load which presents to a small hydro generator, a relatively constant and independent electric load that the demanded consumption for the user varies from none to full load, given as initial parameters a constant flow in the turbine and a control in the line tension. This way it seeks to improve the energy quality given by isolated generators\n\n78 FR 56224 - Hydro Nelson, Ltd.; Hydro-WM, LLC; Notice of Transfer of Exemption\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-09-12\n\n...

In parallel, climate change is very likely to increase the number of such events, due to an increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events (EASAC 2013). Whereas recent work primarily addresses the resilience of large catchment areas, the major impact of hydro-meteorological extremes caused by heavy precipitation is on small areas. Those are very difficult to observe and predict, due to sparse monitoring networks and only few means for hydro-meteorological modelling, especially in small catchment areas. The objective of the EXTRUSO project is to identify and implement appropriate means to close this gap by an interdisciplinary approach, combining comprehensive research expertise from meteorology, hydrology, photogrammetry and geoinformatics. The project targets innovative techniques for achieving spatio-temporal densified monitoring and simulations for the analysis, prediction and warning of local hydro-meteorological extreme events. The following four aspects are of particular interest: 1. The monitoring, analysis and combination of relevant hydro-meteorological parameters from various sources, including existing monitoring networks, ground radar, specific low-cost sensors and crowdsourcing. 2. The determination of relevant hydro-morphological parameters from different photogrammetric sensors (e.g. camera, laser scanner) and sensor platforms (e.g. UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and UWV (unmanned water vehicle)). 3. The continuous hydro-meteorological modelling of precipitation, soil moisture and water flows by means of conceptual and data-driven modelling. 4. The development of a collaborative, web-based service infrastructure as an information and communication point, especially in the case of an extreme event. There are three major applications for the planned information system: First, the warning of local extreme events for the population in potentially affected areas, second, the support\n\nBC Hydro - IPC review : report on the creation of IPC International Power Corporation and its joint venture with the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority for the Raiwind power project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1997-03-01\n\nBC Hydro is one of the sponsors involved in the construction of a thermal electric power plant in Raiwind, Pakistan.

[Grupo de Investigacion IDEA, Escuela Politecnica Superior, University of Jaen, Campus de Las Lagunillas, s/n. 23071-Jaen (Spain)\n\n2009-01-15\n\nOne of the most important elements on the recovery of a small hydro-power plant is the electro-mechanical equipment (turbine-alternator), since the cost of the equipment means a high percentage of the total budget of the plant. The present paper intends to develop a series of equations which determine its cost from basic parameters such as power and net head. These calculations are focused at a level of previous study, so it will be necessary to carry out the engineering project and request a budget to companies specialized on the construction of electro-mechanical equipment to know its cost more accurately. Although there is a great diversity in the typology of turbines and alternators, data from manufacturers which cover all the considered range have been used. The above equations have been developed for the most common of turbines: Pelton, Francis, Kaplan and semiKaplan for a power range below 2 MW. The obtained equations have been validated with data from real installations which have been subject to analysis by engineering companies working on the assembly and design of small plants.
