I work for a dealer and we have 37 bikes sold through\n\nour shop that are affected. We have received about 20 of the kits so far.\n\nDepending on model of bike, the kits take about 1 - 1.2 hours to install. I\n\nwould not recommend doing this yourself. As for the bikes covered by the\n\nrecall, they were manufactured prior to Sept or early Oct. We have had 3 bike\n\nwhere the bolt broke. 2 of them required replacement of the cams and cam cover.\n\nFor the gentleman who was unhappy about another dealer not being able to install\n\nthe kit, here is how it works. The affected bikes are tracked by VIN and which\n\ndealer sold that bike. Initially, a dealer will receive ONLY the quantity\n\nneeded to repair the bikes sold at his dealership resulting in no spares. A\n\ndealer maybe able to order another (not sure if or how its done since I turn\n\nwrenches) for a bike that is not on his list. Hope this helped.\n\nBuffalo\n\njames winston wrote:\n\n> I have heard that this problem can be fixed without authorized Harley kit\n\n> and its relitively cheap. Has anyone else herd this.
