        "text": "On today’s date (September 9), the following happened in my family tree:\n\nIn 1830, my 4th great grandparents Domenicantonio Rossi and Maria Domenica Della Bricciosa married in San Giovanni, Penne, Abruzzo. Domenicantonio was the son of Giovanni Rossi and Anna Saveria Barbacone. Maria Domenica was the daughter of Blasio Della Bricciosa and Vittoria Gambacorta. They were the great grandparents of Cesidio Marcella. (His mother was named Elisabetta Rossi.)\n\nWe have the signature of Domenicantonio Rossi and the signature of Maria Domenica’s father Blasio. I don’t know if this meant they were literate, but they were able to sign their names legibly on the marriage document as you can see. This couple, and other members of their families, moved around this area of Abruzzo to multiple villages during their lifetimes. I don’t know what that means or why. I would love to hear your ideas.\n\nOn my maternal side the following happened:\n\nIn 1594, my 9th great grandmother Vittoria Litieri was baptized in Sant’ Agnese Parish, in San Felice a Cancello, Caserta. I know almost nothing about her, except her parents’ names, Cesare Litieri and Tommasina Secondina, and that she was the mother of my ancestor Pietro Capobianco. A Portia d’Adamo is noted on the baptism and may have been the midwife or the godmother. What is your guess? What do you see?\n\nIn 1834, my 3rd great grandfather Joseph Anton Heinzen was baptised in the Catholic parish of Glis near the Swiss border with Italy in Valais. He was born the day before in the tiny hamlet of Lingwurm. The godparents noted in the church record were Felix Nillen and Maria Josepha Nillin. His parents were Johann Joseph Heinzen and Anna Maria Vollmar. They were farmers.\n\nCoincidentally, his daughter, on September 9, 1886, my immigrant second great grandmother Anne Aloisia (Anna) Heinzen and Ludwig (Louis) Fritz Kirsch got married before a Justice of the Peace in Chicago. She was Catholic and he was Lutheran.\n\nIn 1864, during a cholera epidemic in Chicago, 10 month old Loretta Schuttler, my second great grandmother Katharina Schuttler’s baby sister died.\n\nFinally, on the other side of the Atlantic, in 1886, in Montecalvario, Naples, Italy, Carmen Ferraro’s sister Elena Ferraro was born. In America she married Angelo Scarnecchia.\n\nDo you have any additions or corrections, or are we related? Please email me, because WordPress does not notify you if I comment on your comment on my blog. cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net.\n\n.\n\nOn today’s date (September 2nd) in family history, the following events happened on my maternal side:\n\nIn 1862, my immigrant second great grandmother Anne (Anna) Marie Aloisia Heinzen was born in Lingwurm, a tiny hamlet of houses near Brig, Canton Valais, Switzerland. She was the daughter of Joseph Anton Heinzen and Italian-Swiss Regina Gentineta. Happy Birthday!\n\nIn 1881, my immigrant second great grand uncle Alexander Bold, who was born near Nuenschweiler, close to Alsace, France in Germany, two different Chicago newspapers published reports on his duties as a Chicago Police Officer. He raised an alarm when a four story brick plaining mill owned by Wintermeyer & Dempsey caught fire. It was a total loss for the company. He also struggled with a gun a perpetrator and shot him. Officer Alexander Bold had been on the scene because the perpetrator had shot five people.\n\nIn 1928, the Chicago Tribune ran an advertisement for my immigrant great grandfather Carmen Ferraro’s opera school at the Lyon-Healy building, in which he offered “part scholarships to few promising voices.”\n\nIn 1971, the Montreal Gazette featured a story on a American detective agency run by a woman, which was rare in those days. The article mentioned that she and her former boss, my first cousin two times removed Albert R. Valerioti, attended the World Detective Conference happening in Montreal. It also states, that he was called the “Prince of Detectives” because decades before he was responsible for transporting Hiroshima’s atomic bomb fragments from New York to Washington. Albert was the son of Angela Maria Ferraro, my great grandfather Carmen Ferraro’s sister.\n\nOn my paternal side, the following happened:\n\nIn 1791, my 5th great grandmother Rosalinda Maddalena Mincarelli was born in Penne, Abruzzo to Domenico and Anna Maria Giulia Di Federico. She was a lace maker and was the spouse of Massimo Antonio Nicola Uriano. If you are keeping tracek, she was an ancestor of Luigia Massei.\n\nAre we related, or do you have an addition or correction? Please email me, because for some reason WordPress does not send you my reply if you simply comment on this post. My email is-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nOn today’s date (August 30th) in family history, the following happened:\n\nIn 1811, my 6th great grandfather Giuseppe Marzola died in Farindola at 8 am at age 77. He was born in Farindola and lived at Rione della Croceria and was a contadino. His parents were Domenicantonio Marzola and Anna Maria Colella. He was the widow of Rosina Pompili. Domenico and Rosina are in my tree twice. They are the ancestors of both my paternal grandmother, through their daughter Giovanna Marzola, who was married to the Cancelliere di Farindola, Nicola Carusi, making them the ancestors of Luigia Massei; and, my paternal grandfather, through their son Domenico Marzola who married midwife Maria Donata Di Costanzo from Penne, making them ancestors of Serafina Merlenghi. This is why we research the female lines. The fact they were in my tree twice made my paternal grandparents 5th cousins to each other.\n\nAlso on today’s date in Farindola, a pair of several times over great grand aunts Apollonia Cirone and Anna Eleuteria Iannascoli passed away in 1817.\n\nOn my maternal side, the following happened:\n\nIn 1816, the parents of my immigrant 3rd great grandmother Marie Louise Koppel Eckebrecht, Johann Christoph Koppel and Anna Maria Dorothea Grabe were married in Koerner, Thuringia, Germany. Johann Christoph is noted as owner of the Riethmuhle (mill) on his children’s baptisms in Koerner through at least 1820. Koerner is on the River Unstrut. There is a Riethmuhle in Koerner as of 1900, at the west end of the village on the Heuberg Hill, on Notter Creek. At the time of Marie Louise’s death in the United States, her property included a mill in Germany that may have been this mill.\n\nIn 1820, a cousin several times removed, Bernardo Criscuolo, was born in Nola, outside Naples. He was a blood relation of Filomena Napolitano.\n\nIn 1854, my second great grandmother Katharina Schuttler was born in Chicago to immigrants John Schuttler and Louise Gerbing. She was my first ancestor born on this continent.\n\nIn 1866, my second great grand aunt Anna Maria Heinzen was born in Brig, Valais, Switzerland to Joseph Anton Heinzen and Italian-Swiss Regina Gentinetta.\n\nIn 1896, cousin several times removed, Charles Gerbing, won the German Wheelmen’s Race (Cycling) in Chicago but ended up being disqualified.\n\nFinally, it was reported in two newspapers on today’s date in 1912, that my great grandfather, Carmen Ferraro, used a stage name of Mr. Armanno Vittorio, and told the reporter he was from the Colon Theater in Buenos Aires, when he gave an operatic performance as a dramatic tenor.\n\nAre we related? Do you have an addition or correction? Please email me-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nOn today’s date in 1837, my third great grandmother Regina Anna Maria Catarina Giuseppa Filomena Gentinetta was born in Brig, Switzerland. She was the daughter of Francesco Giuseppe Gentinetta and Anna Maria Regina Theresia Mutter. Anna Maria Regina Theresia Mutter was from the village of Niederwald – birthplace of Cesar Ritz.\n\nWho was Regina? She was the mother of my immigrant second great grandmother Anna Heinzen (Kirsch) and immigrant Leo Heinzen. In 1858, Regina married Joseph Anton Heinzen, a farmer. Their wedding record stated that her father was from Italy, specifically Valle Bognanco. However, the 1870 Cenus for Ried, Brig, which I had to comb through one by one, stated he was born in Ried. I do not know which is correct.\n\nAlso according to that census, Regina, husband Joseph Anton, and their children, including Anna, were residing with her father Francesco Gentinetta. Please see the image below. He is at the top of the page – indicated as Franz.\n\nEarlier census records for Ried are online as well at the Archives of Valais in Sion. Unfortunately, there are so many Franz Gentinettas and misspellings of the surname I do not know which is ours. Adding to the confusion is the fact that his father was also named Franz!\n\nRegina passed away on October 1, 1911 in Brig, Switzerland. Some day I hope I get to see a photo of her.\n\nAre we related? Do you have a correction or addition? Please email me at cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net.\n\nOn today’s date in 1629, the witchcraft trial of my 10th great grandfather Martin Heinzen started at Freigericht Ganter, near Glis, Valais, Switzerland because someone in the local populace had sick livestock and other executed witches had implicated him as their accomplice. Martin ended up being tortured for nearly a week in hopes of extracting confessions of sorcery.\n\nMayor Kaspar Stockaler was the man responsible for routing out witches in the local population. Thirty witnesses had sworn statements against my 10th great grandfather.\n\nBecause Ganter didn’t have a torture device, they borrowed one from nearby Brig.\n\nThrough his long torture, Martin confessed every sin, and in an article in French on the subject of witchcraft trials in Valais, he confessed every “pecadillo” BUT sorcery. On the 12th of October 1629, friends and relatives of Martin demanded his release. So he was released and ordered to pay one third of the costs of his trial!\n\nWhen I found this sensational fact about my ancestor, I discovered that the witch trial madness had actually started in Valais, Switzerland in 1428 before it spread to the rest of Europe. It started there! You can find headings about this sad phenomena under such headings as “Valais witch trials” and “Swiss werewolf witch trials.” I am still searching for a book in English on the subject.\n\nMartin went on to marry and have my 9th great grandfather Kaspar Heinzen. Of note is the fact that Martin’s wife and Kaspar’s mother – Barbara Andamatten, shared a surname with one of Ganter’s witchcraft judges.\n\nMartin Heinzen’s tale appears in “Das Freigerecht Ganter” and “Notes sur les procès d’hérésie et de sorcellerie en Valais” because he was an accused sorcerer that walked away from one of these terrible trials with his life.\n\nI suspect Martin may be my 10th great grandfather two times over. I need to do some more digging. Martin is the ancestor of my immigrant second great grandmother Anne Marie Aloisia Heinzen.\n\nDo you have Swiss ancestors accused of sorcery? Have you found European ancestors accused of witchcraft?\n\nSources:\n\nDionys Imesch, “Das Freigericht Ganter”, dans Blätter aus der Walliser Geschichte, Bd 3, 1902-1906, S. 70-100, surtout p. 82-83 (http://doc.rero.ch/record/200661)\n\nKirchegemeinde Glis\n\n“Hexerei im Oberwallis” um 1600 von Hans Steffen\n\nJules-Bernard Bertrand, “Notes sur les procès d’hérésie et de sorcellerie en Valais”, dans Annales valaisannes, 1921, vol. 3, n° 2-3, p. 151-194, surtout p. 189-191 (en ligne: http://doc.rero.ch/record/6753)\n\nThank you to the great people in Genealogie Familienforschung Ahnenforschung Schweiz and Genealogy Translations…\n\nThis post was originally shared 4 years ago on this date.\n\ncinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net\n\nSwitzerland\n\nJohann Joseph Heinzen was born near Brig, Valais, Switzerland in 1782 to my fifth great grandfather Joseph Ignaz Christian Heinzen, and his first wife, Anne Marie Fintschen. According to Le soldat valaisan au service de l’Empereur Napoléon: un service étranger différent (1806-1811) – in Vallesia, by Louiselle de Riedmatten, via Geneanet, when he was baptized, his godfather was Major D. Joseph Berenfaller. I did a quick search of the Berenfallers and believe they were a local Brig family.\n\nOn May 1, 1807, at age 24, Johann Joseph entered into the foreign service of Emperor Napoleon. His matricule number was 465. He was my 4th great grand uncle.\n\nAt this time I would like to acknowledge the various other Heinzens, Mutters, and Gentinettas that are distant cousins, or whom I cannot currently verify a relationship to, who were in Napoleon’s foreign service. They would all be relations of immigrant Anne Marie Heinzen Kirsch.\n\nItaly\n\nMeanwhile, south of Switzerland in Italy, in 1808, my sixth great grandfather Paolo Carusi was made Luogotenete (Lieutenant) of the Guardia Urbano by the local occupying Bonapartist French military leader. He would have been around 72 years old at this time.\n\nPaolo was given command of 12 French soldiers with the purpose of hunting down the brigands of Farindola and the environs. In fact, some of the local brigands made alliances against the French, and were former soldiers themselves, who had fought against the Bonapartists in the north of Italy in the 1790s. These former soldiers included one Massimo Marcella of Trosciano, purported to be the local go-between between brigand factions. Paolo Carusi, and this period of upheaval in Farindola, are mentioned in the book Storia di Farindola, Dalle Origini ai Giorni Nostri by Antonio Procacci.\n\nGennaro Carusi, in his great book, I Carusi, suggests that Paolo may have been chosen for this assignment because he may have had prior military experience.\n\nI have written here before of Paolo and his children. Paolo Carusi was also one of the few in Farindola that could write. Paolo was the ancestor of Luigia Maria Massei.\n\n-cinziarosagenealogy@comcast.net"
