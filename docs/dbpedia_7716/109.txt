Established in 2022, Offbeat Films has written, directed, and produced five short films and one feature film. In 2023, we melded with She is a Siren Pictures LLC and together we create stories told from the queer female eye.

Our short film, "Behind Bars,"

was an Official Selection and received two awards at the Indie Short Fest. It was also a Finalist for the New York International Film Awards, and an Official selection/Semi-Finalist at the Boden International Film Festival. In addition, "Behind Bars" received the title of Best Sports Film and was chosen to be screened at the Oniros Film Awards in Manhattan, New York.

Our short film "Speak,"

was an Official Selection and award nominee in three categories for the Indie Short Fest. It was also a Finalist for the New York International Film Awards, and an Official Selection/Semi-Finalist at the Boden International Film Festival. In addition, "Speak" was screened at the See It This Way festival in Salt Lake City, Utah and was screened at The Screen Awards in Green Bay, Wisconsin and was awarded Best Film on Mental Health.

Our short film "The Unbidden Guests" is currently available to watch on YouTube.

We have two additional films that are currently in the film festival circuit, "Run Raya" and "Irreconcilable Sin."

Our feature film "Destiny's Window," is currently in post production.

We look forward to creating more projects and telling more stories. We are always looking for more like-minded people to collaborate with. We know how hard the industry is; and it's much harder to go at it alone. We have a short film coming up in 2024 and will be collaborating with a wonderful Director and Actress.
