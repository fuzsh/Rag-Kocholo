I tried, but it just didn't happen, and that's usually a recipe for bad feelings for me. Today was not an exception. The barometric change didn't help.\n\nAfter work I took a short nap, and was opening the door to go practice with offBeat when I got the phone call saying that practice was cancelled. I stayed home, took a walk, and completely forgot that Paul and Storm were at Café Montmartre until the show was already underway. On top of that I'd also had to decline an invitation to hang out with evil_jim because I thought we'd be practicing. That annoyed me, but it was really the only thing that happened today to justify my mood. Otherwise my depression has been entirely internal. And really, it's not so much depression as fatigue. I'm lucid enough to recognize that.\n\nAnyway, I haven't discussed our gig at Steep & Brew yet. It went really well. Lots of people showed up -- mostly because I told them to. lord_alucard, laviorli, renny1780, angelic667, phil_bond, mlitiagrl, inle_the_rabbit, Michael, Andrew (the guy who formerly owned The Elves' Palace) and his girlfriend Sarah, my mom, my aunt Patricia, my sister and boyfriend all showed up, and mercifully stayed for the whole show. Actually, most of the rest of the audience stayed too, and there were quite a few people who stood in the doorway listening because they didn't fit into the room. Even if half of the audience hadn't been there to see me, it still would have been a successful show played to a good-sized crowd. Thanks to those who attended -- we really appreciate it. Y'all done me proud.\n\nWe did pretty much our entire set, and it went really well. The audience was very responsive, so we (well, mostly Eric, our vocal percussionist) formed a good rapport with them. I think everybody went home feeling positive about the show. I'd really like to perform at Steep & Brew again, but Tuesday's show was part of a concert series showcasing local acts, and God knows there are enough acts local to the Madison area.\n\nOh. Just FYI -- I'm seeing 667: The Number of the Neighbor of the Beast on Sunday for anyone who wants to accompany me. It's just $7, and speaking from a barely-qualified standpoint, you have my personal guarantee that it will be a good time. If not, um, talk to me after the show and we'll work something out.\n\nCurrent Mood: better, I guess\n\nCurrent Music: People Are Wrong soundtrack -- Xanthus Saves"
