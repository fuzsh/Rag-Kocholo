        "text": "As bleak as it is astonishingly beautiful, Hlynur Pálmason’s Godland feels a worthy successor to films like Powell and Pressburger’s Black Narcissus, Robert Bresson’s Diary of a Country Priest, and Fred Zinnemann’s A Nun’s Story for its depiction of a young priest, Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove), dispatched in the late 19th century to remote Iceland, where he is to help establish a church and photograph its congregants. Between the extraordinary demands of the journey, however, and his relationships with Ragnar (Ingvar Sigurðsson), his flinty guide, and Anna (Vic Carmen Sonne), the daughter of a local man, Lucas’s body, mind, and faith are all severely—even tragically—tested. —Marley Marius\n\nThe Quiet Girl\n\nI was bewitched and then overwhelmed by this quiet, lovely Irish film, which scored a surprise nomination for international feature at the 2023 Oscars. Based on the story “Foster” by Claire Keegan, it is about a nine-year-old named Cait who is sent by her neglectful, overwhelmed parents to nearby childless relatives for a summer in the Irish countryside. It’s a simple tale about loneliness and reticent need, but it swells with feeling and somehow never tips into maudlin sweetness. Young star Catherine Clinch holds an entire world in her mute, expressive face, and the middle-aged couple who looks after her (played by Carrie Crowley and Andrew Bennett) channel an incredible compassion even as they are hemmed in by circumstance and family obligation. I defy you not to be moved to tears by the end. —T.A.\n\nReturn to Seoul\n\nA Thousand and One is the knockout first feature from filmmaker A.V. Rockwell that took home the Grand Jury prize at Sundance in January. It stars a commanding Teyana Taylor as Inez, a mom who steals her son, Terry, away from foster care and raises him in Harlem through the hardscrabble period of 1990s and early-2000s New York. Taylor brings a natural authenticity to a difficult role—a story of survival, essentially, of a Black woman dedicating her life to a gifted son who is freighted with a terrible history. Atmospheric, gritty, and heartbreaking, with a standout performance from its lead that is sure to generate awards season buzz. —T.A.\n\nApril\n\nAre You There God? It’s Me, Margaret\n\nThe difficulty of being a tweenage girl hasn’t changed much since Judy Blume first wrote Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret in 1970, but at least we have movies like this one—sweet, sad, soulful, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, and ideal fare for adults and kids alike—to pad young women’s crash-landing into adulthood. Rachel McAdams is particularly great in her role as an artistic New York City mom adjusting to the suburbs, and her high-waisted jeans and lightly feathered hair are major style inspo, at least for those of us who didn’t live through the ’70s when they actually happened.—Emma Specter\n\nOther People’s Children\n\nThe topic of fertility, though ubiquitous in modern life, is relatively unexplored in cinema—as are women characters who are child-free by choice. In French writer-director Rebecca Zlotowski’s Other People’s Children, the luminescent French actor Virginie Efira stars as a 40-something Paris schoolteacher who, after beginning a relationship with a man who has a daughter from a previous marriage, starts to entertain thoughts of motherhood. It’s a refreshingly warm, nuanced film with charming humor that’s worlds away from the sad childless-old-maid trope; instead it’s a thoughtful and full depiction of a sexy, empowered middle-aged woman as well as a meditation on legacies, the emotional tightrope of being a stepmother, and the ambivalence that can arise near the end of a child-free woman’s fertility. You won’t want to miss a delightful cameo by revered documentarian Frederick Wiseman and Chiara Mastroianni as the ex-wife hovering on the sidelines. —L.W.M.\n\nShowing Up\n\nMarking Michelle Williams’s fourth collaboration with filmmaker Kelly Reichardt, Showing Up centers on a small creative community in Portland, Oregon, where Lizzy (Williams), a sculptor, is preparing to mount a new show as she deals with minor familial drama (mostly to do with her rudderless brother, played by John Magaro) and a cold war with her friend-slash-rival-slash-landlord, Jo (Hong Chau). By turns gently funny and deeply ruminative—with a powerful attention to the hard work of being creative—the film is a refreshingly low-key delight. —M.M.\n\nMay\n\nBlackBerry\n\nIn case you missed this hilarious and surprisingly gripping rise-and-fall corporate tale of the Canadian tech startup that broke big with the BlackBerry, now's your chance. Directed by Matt Johnson and starring a perfectly cast Jay Baruchel as Research in Motion's a nerd-turned-titan, BlackBerry has been re-released on AMC+ as a three-part limited series with a bunch of extra footage. You probably think you don't much care about the smalltime engineers who came up with the world's first smartphone, but once you start watching BlackBerry, which has a breakneck pace and a comedic secret weapon in the alpha male CEO (Glenn Howerton, savage) who leads them to riches, you won't look back.—T.A.\n\nPast Lives\n\nPast Lives is the first film from playwright Celine Song, and its superb and romantic—certainly one of the best movies of the year. This is a highly personal story of a young woman named Nora, played as an adult by Greta Lee, who immigrates to the US with her family when she’s 12, leaving a neighborhood boy, Hae Sung, behind in Seoul. She and Hae Sung reconnect online 12 years later and then again in person when Nora is in her 30s and married, living in New York’s East Village. Past Lives is a patient, transporting portrait of romance and thwarted love, with themes of friendship, ambition, and regret. A humane and lovely study of how people change—and how they don’t. —T.A.\n\nYou Hurt My Feelings\n\nIt’s impossible not to enjoy this funny, gentle, wryly thoughtful movie from veteran filmmaker Nicole Holofcener, about relationships among middle-aged bohemian couples in Brooklyn. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tobias Menzies play a married pair at the center of the action: Beth, a writer who has published one semi-successful memoir and is now finishing a novel, and Don, a therapist in private practice. When Beth overhears Don tell her brother-in-law that he doesn’t actually like her manuscript—though he’s assured her he loves it—a crisis of trust erupts. Holofcener amplifies a drama of small stakes into scenes of marital jousting and tension that are diffused by larger problems of parenting and aging and just…getting on with things. A small movie, but poised and hilarious. —T.A.\n\nJune\n\nBlue Jean\n\nSet in the northeast of England during the late 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher’s proposed Section 28 legislation helped fuel a growing climate of homophobia within schools, Blue Jean follows a gay teacher, Jean (played in a knockout performance by Rosy McEwen), who lives a double life. First, she’s forced to negotiate how to handle the arrival of a queer student who seems to have a sixth sense about Jean’s sexuality, and then, the subsequent tensions with her girlfriend over the hostility of the world surrounding them. A moving, deeply atmospheric character study of its protagonist’s struggle to come to terms with her identity—and cleverly laced with nods to the consequences of Jean’s story within the wider world—the film marks McEwen and director Georgia Oakley as serious talents on the rise. —L.H.\n\nJuly\n\nAfire\n\nIra Sachs (Love Is Strange, Little Men) crafted one of the hottest and most layered romantic dramas of the year with Passages, about a filmmaker, Tomas (Franz Rogowski), who—much to the chagrin of his long-suffering husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw)—takes up with a schoolteacher, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos) after a messy night out…only to come miserably slinking back when Martin begins an affair of his own. Reckless intimacy and emotional manipulation come to a head in this seductive three-hander. —M.M.\n\nSeptember\n\nFair Play\n\nFair Play crosses the throwback erotic-thriller vibes of classic Adrian Lyne movies like Fatal Attraction with the chilly, high-stakes finance maneuverings of recent shows like Billions and Industry. A young Manhattan couple, Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) and Emily (Phoebe Dynevor), work at the same hedge fund, even as they carry on a secret love affair. They can’t keep their hands off each other; Luke proposes, and wedding plans are set. Then Emily gets the promotion that Luke was expecting at work, and the power balance between them is upended. Fair Play is well-paced and provocative on ideas about gender and ambition and ego. It’s also edgy and angry and a little bit salacious. —T.A.\n\nOctober\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nJust a year after Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis sent Austin Butler flying into the stratosphere, Sofia Coppola is telling Priscilla Presley’s side of the story, adapting her 1985 memoir, Elvis and Me, for the big screen. An early teaser, alive with saturated colors and perfect period details, sets the scene—promising a heady, Marie Antoinette-esque portrait of a dreamy young woman thrust into totally otherworldly circumstances. Cailee Spaeny (The Mare of Easttown) stars as Priscilla in all her girlish, raven-haired, cat-eyed glory, while Jacob Elordi plays a quietly menacing Elvis. —M.M.\n\nNovember\n\nFallen Leaves\n\nA tender, melancholy romance infused with the dry comedy that legendary Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki is renowned for, Fallen Leaves centers on two lonely and star-crossed Helsinki souls who manage to connect in an unfeeling world. In fewer than 90 minutes, it gestures at larger themes—the devastation of war, the ruthlessness of capitalism, and the isolation of contemporary life—in between moments of true hilarity, making it a salve in a year packed with bloated, clumsy movies that achieve no more than a fraction of the emotion that Fallen Leaves conjures. —L.W.M.\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nTodd Haynes, a proven master of the modern melodrama, delivers a captivating triple character study with May December—a movie dense with references both cinematic and pop-cultural (Joseph Losey’s The Go-Between, Ingmar Bergman’s Persona and Winter Light, and the case of Mary Kay Letourneau are all touchpoints), and yet utterly its own thing. Set near Savannah, Georgia, in 2015, it follows an actress named Elizabeth (Natalie Portman, never better) as she prepares to play Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore, sublime), a semi-professional baker who, some 20 years earlier, made national headlines for her affair with Joe, a 13-year-old friend of her son’s. When Elizabeth arrives at their home, Gracie and Joe—now an emotionally stunted, 30-something X-ray technician (played by Riverdale’s Charles Melton, a revelation)—are living a relatively quiet life with their nearly grown children. But her increasingly depraved attempts to understand the Atherton-Yoos’ relationship threatens to upend it entirely. —M.M.\n\nNapoleon\n\nAt 85 years old, Ridley Scott is in one of the most prolific stages of his career, with The Last Duel and House of Gucci both premiering in 2021 and an upcoming, hotly anticipated Gladiator sequel filming for much of this year (the SAG-AFTRA strike paused its progress in July). His newest film, the grand, galloping Napoleon, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the French military leader and eventual emperor, is a lavish epic—heavy on the well-orchestrated battle scenes and never lacking in drama and detail. The film's smaller-scale moments focus on Napoleon's tempestuous love story with his first wife, Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby), whom he was forced to divorce after she was unable to bear him an heir. —L.H.\n\nDecember\n\nAll of Us Strangers\n\nAndrew Haigh—the celebrated writer-director of Weekend (2011), 45 Years (2015), and the series Looking and The North Water—is back with a searching and emotionally resonant movie about a love affair between two London neighbors. All of Us Strangers is adapted from a 1987 novel by Taichi Yamada and stars Andrew Scott as Adam, a London screenwriter who falls into a hothouse affair with Harry (Paul Mescal), while at the same time attempting to reckon with the death of his parents (played by Claire Foy and Jamie Bell) from 30 years before. Supernatural mysteries collide with aching examination of things left unsaid in an acting tour de force. —M.M.\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nIn our charged, fractious moment, few films are riskier propositions than those about race. But Cord Jefferson’s debut feature, American Fiction, succeeds, propelled by impressive performances from Jeffery Wright and Sterling K. Brown, laugh-out-loud humor, and an askance view toward easy moralizing. Wright plays a frustrated novelist who, disgusted by tired and offensive tropes in Black entertainment, writes a book full of them under a pen name—and ends up at the center of the hypocrisy of the publishing world. Confronting the commodification of marginalized voices and society’s insistence on reducing individuals to stereotypes, it’s a provocative, wickedly funny interrogation sure to speak to anyone who sees themselves in more expansive ways than the world sees them. —L.W.M.\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nDirected by Blitz Bazawule and (re-)adapted for the screen by Marcus Gardley, this coming-of-age period drama based on Alice Walker’s 1982 novel (and its Tony-winning reimagining for Broadway) tells the story of Celie—an African American woman living in the South and doing her best to navigate abuse, poverty, and racism during the early 1900s—for the second time on the big screen. The incredibly starry cast includes Fantasia, Halle Bailey, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Taraji P. Henson, H.E.R., and Ciara. —E.S.\n\nThe End We Start From\n\nQuiet, tense, and beautiful to look at, this dystopian drama, a first feature from the UK director Mahalia Belo, is an adaptation of the excellent 2017 novel by Megan Hunter. It tells the dreamlike story of catastrophic floods hitting London just as our unnamed protagonist gives birth to her son. Jodie Comer plays the new mother in a wonderfully committed, highly physical role that will have people talking. A survival drama ensues, one resonantly focused on women and mothers and their particular forms of determination. Comer is radiant and resilient and keeps the film from turning bleak as she travels through a reeling, rain-soaked England. Katherine Waterston and Benedict Cumberbatch are also excellent in supporting roles. —T.A.\n\nFerrari\n\nThe director Michael Mann—unsurpassed purveyor of stylized action cool—may be 80, but his Ferrari, a mid-century set epic about Enzo Ferrari and his attempt to rescue his namesake motorsport company from bankruptcy, is an excitingly ambitious and delightfully vroom-vroom holiday drama. Filmed in Italy with Adam Driver in the lead role and Penélope Cruz as his sparring wife Laura, it is heavy on style and transporting in its Formula 1 and Mille Miglia set pieces. Mann specializes in escapism for grown ups—serious and satisfying even when they’re built for fun. —T.A.\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\nSam Esmail is the hyper-talented creator of Mr. Robot and the director of the first season of the undersung paranoid thriller Homecoming for Prime. With Leave the World Behind, he’s adapted a brilliantly disquieting novel by Rumaan Alam, in which a weekend-home domestic drama is shadowed by end times. He has a gonzo cast to help him: Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la Herrold, and Kevin Bacon. The result is a technically brilliant, jitteringly tense, and haunting tour of impending apocalypse. —T.A.\n\nPoor Things"
