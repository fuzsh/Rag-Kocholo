        "text": "Midway through “Miles Ahead,” Miles Davis, anticipating a journalist’s question, asks, “Why don’t you play like you used to?” He answers himself: “You have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself.”\n\nComebacks, however, are not simply what haunt Davis (played here magnificently by Don Cheadle) in his non-recording years in the late 1970s, when the movie is set. Chasing the ghost of one’s first love, whether it be the muse for the music or simply the music itself, coincidentally is the main conceit for two other new jazz movies, the Chet Baker-inspired “Born to Be Blue” and “Nina,” based on Nina Simone.\n\nAs much as these movies resemble each other — with flashbacks and films-within-a-film, as well as plots driven by how effectively their aging characters master personal demons and professional demands — they are not so much about the life of jazz luminaries in an era past their prime. Instead, these are films about our own genre expectations and the fate of a Hollywood standard: the jazz biopic itself."
