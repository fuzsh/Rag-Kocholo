        "text": "A new short film, 17 Year Locust, shot on location in Lafayette, La., about an unlikely crossing of paths between two people living very different lives, their only common connection being the French language, will premiere on TV5MONDE USA and the New Orleans French Film Festival later this month.\n\nThe short film titled 17 Year Locust follows René (Stevenson Jean), a Haitian immigrant, who moves to Louisiana in search of a better life with his pregnant wife. When Odile (Becca Begnaud), an elderly Cajun woman in hospice care, demands a French-speaking caregiver, the staffing agency reaches out to René, who is the only option they have. After intense conversation, Odile learns from René that he intends to abandon his own culture and traditions in exchange for becoming “a true citizen,” an American. It’s only then she feels brave to open up and share her own story of American assimilation and the great cost that came with it.\n\nWinner of a $25,000 award from the fourth annual #CreateLouisiana French Culture Film Grant, 17 year Locust was co-written by Logan LeBlanc and Trevor Navarre, directed by LeBlanc and produced by Allison Bohl DeHart. The short film will premiere on Thursday, March 18, at 10:05 p.m. CST on TV5MONDE USA, the lead sponsor of the annual grant and America’s only 24/7 French language entertainment channel. The film will also have its world theatrical run as part of the 2021 New Orleans French Film Festival on Saturday, March 27, at 7:45 p.m. at The Broadside and virtually through the Eventive platform during the festival dates (March 23–March 31). The premieres of the film are set to coincide with the annual celebration of International Francophonie Month (Journée internationale de la Francophonie) in March. The film will also be screened at French Embassy in Washington, D.C., on March 20.\n\n“This compelling film about a French-speaking immigrant looking to assimilate into an American way of life perfectly reflects our mission to celebrate francophone culture and we hope it serves as a conversation starter among our viewers regarding this very timely topic,” said Patrice Courtaban, chief operating officer of TV5MONDE USA.\n\nThe #CreateLouisiana French Culture Film Grant is designed to support thoughtful new films that showcase Francophone culture and talent from across the state of Louisiana. In addition to TV5MONDE USA, the 2020 #CreateLouisiana French Culture Film Grant was supported by Deep South Studios, the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, and Cox Communications. The funding opportunity aims to champion indigenous filmmaking talent and celebrate the diverse culture of Louisiana.\n\nTV5MONDE is the global French language entertainment network, broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without commercial interruptions. TV5MONDE USA is a premium pay-tv channel reaching 1.5 million viewers in the U.S. American viewers enjoy a wealth of high quality French language programming, subtitled in English, including up to 300 classic, recent and never-before-seen in the U.S. French language films, around-the-clock newscasts live from Paris, the latest series and TV dramas, premium documentaries, cultural programs and international sports coverage."
