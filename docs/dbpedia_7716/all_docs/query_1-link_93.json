        "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--Got the next JibJab sitting in your video camera? A new company plans to give unknown auteurs a place to sell their flicks online.\n\nBrightcove, founded in 2004 by former Macromedia CTO Jeremy Allaire, will launch a service later this year that will let filmmakers who are not part of the studio system sell their movies directly to consumers. Most won't be two-hour epics. Instead, the site will largely cater to budding cartoonists, independent directors and the people who happen to have good video of sports moments, natural disasters or current events.\n\nRelated story\n\nNew methods eyed\n\nfor buying movies\n\nA start-up offers\n\na new way to sell\n\nused DVDs. Others\n\nare getting rid of\n\nthe disk entirely.\n\n\"Rights holders will be radically empowered,\" he told an audience here Monday at PC Forum, an event owned by CNET Networks, publisher of News.com. \"The editorial control (of broadcast networks) is something that will be pushed out to the Internet.\"\n\nVideo on demand has replaced Internet appliance and social networking as the buzzword concept among consumer start-ups. Some, such as EZTakes, hope to deliver movies to the home over broadband networks that can be burned to DVDs. Others, such as ObjectCube, are already delivering adult content in this manner. The company is specializing in adult content largely because major studios remain skittish about Internet downloads.\n\nHistory says some of these companies may make it, while many will perish.\n\nBrightcove's plan is to create an entertainment distribution portal for artists such as Brian Taylor, a self-taught graphic artist in Scotland who created the Rustboy cartoon. Warren Miller, who directs ski movies that get shown in municipal auditoriums, also fits the profile of a Brightcove director. Allaire didn't say that Taylor or Miller would participate in the service, but he showed off their films during a demonstration of the technology at the conference.\n\nDirectors will sell their sell their movies on Brightcove's site, which will also leverage community input to determine what to host there. Consumers will likely be able to buy single films or subscriptions to the films from directors on the site and then watch them on a TV or PC.\n\nThe site will make money through facilitating these sales and, in all likelihood, advertising.\n\n\"We don't expect to see any significant Hollywood content\" in the relatively near future, he said. \"Our expectation is to not allow pornography.\"\n\nIs there a market for obscure content? While people differ in their opinions on that subject, Allaire asserts that at least there is a huge quantity of it. Brightcove, he acknowledges, will also have to patrol its site for movies of questionable taste and those that raise problematic legal issues. A home movie of someone chopping off a finger probably won't make it onto the site.\n\nThe emphasis on unknown artists is also a reflection of the difficulties involved in getting deals with studios and cable operators.\n\n\"The problem is negotiating an economic arrangement with those operators is a very cumbersome, complex process,\" Allaire said.\n\nAlthough the burgeoning field is already very crowded, Brightcove has connections working in its favor. Allaire founded Allaire Corp., which merged with software maker Macromedia in the late 1990s. Brightcove investors include Accel Partners."
