        "text": "Tower centres on a thirty-four year old man, Derek, who lives at home with his parents in Toronto, Canada. Unlike his married brother, who is expecting a baby, Derek is single and without a career. Although he aspires to become a graphic-animator, he works part-time at his uncle's construction company.\n\nLate at night, he wanders the streets alone and frequents nightclubs in search of companionship. Derek suddenly finds himself in an intimate relationship with a woman he meets, Nicole. When a neighbourhood raccoon becomes a constant nuisance by tearing up his family's garbage, Derek sets out to catch it.\n\nWhen an archeologist finds an ancient mask, the excitement of the discovery soon becomes terror as he finds himself tormented by disturbing and surreal visions that slowly drive him mad. As these visions become increasingly violent, he must find a way to escape them before his nightmare becomes a reality. This horror classic was unleashed on audiences with an early use of 3-D, adding to its completely bizarre nature.\n\n“The management is not responsible for nervous breakdowns,” one poster cautioned during the film’s original release! And while the film may not be that terrifying, the 3-D sequences were truly inventive and unique, and remain surprisingly freaky and effective even now.\n\nUnsettling and surreal, this was the first Canadian horror film released in theatres and is still a favourite amongst horror aficionados."
