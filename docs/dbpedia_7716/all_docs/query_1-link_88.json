        "text": "Two early Mexican horror pictures and a pair of offbeat westerns make up Indicatorâs March slate, all to be released in both the UK and the US/Canada.\n\nWhile Universal Studios was making its classic versions ofÂ DraculaÂ andÂ Frankenstein, RamÃ³n PeÃ³nÂ and Fernando de Fuentes were each busy directing the first two horror films to be madeÂ with sound in Mexico, La Llorona and The Phantom of the Monastery [El fantasma del convento]. These atmospheric chillers, which await the wider audienceÂ they richly deserve, are releasedÂ on 21 March in the UK and 22 March in the US/Canada.Â Also released on 21/22 March is Budd Boetticher’s final foray into the western genre, the 1969 A Time for Dying. And taking the western to Australia, Philippe Moraâs Mad Dog Morgan (1976) tells the true story of infamous bushranger and outlaw Dan Morgan\n\nLA LLORONA (1933) Limited Edition Blu-ray Â (World Blu-ray premiere) | 21 March 2022 | Â£15.99\n\nAn early horror classic drawn from Mexicoâs rich tradition of folklore, La Llorona recounts the chilling tale of the âwailing womanâ who kills herself and her child before returning to haunt the living.\n\nExpressionistic, lyrical and atmospheric, RamÃ³n PeÃ³n’s film draws on the influence of Universal Pictures’ contemporaneous horror cycle and incorporates elements of period melodrama and romance. This landmark production in the evolution of Mexican cinema has been newly restored from the only surviving film elements, and is presented here with a selection of essential extras.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY FEATURES:\n\nNew restoration from the only surviving film element\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nLa llorona: Behind the ScenesÂ (2021): documentary by Viviana GarcÃ­a BesnÃ©, the producer's great granddaughter, relaying a personal history of the film\n\nVideo appreciation by Abraham Castillo Flores, head programmer of Mexico’s Morbido Fest (2022)\n\nOptional English subtitles\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet featuring a new essay by Emily Masincup, Peter Conheim on the restoration process, new and archival writing on the film, and an overview of contemporary critical responses\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited edition of 2,000 copies for the UK (4,000 copies for the world)\n\nTHE PHANTOM OF THE MONASTERY [EL FANTASMA DEL CONVENTO] (1933) Limited Edition Blu-ray Â (World Blu-ray premiere) | 21 March 2022 | Â£15.99\n\nMade in the wake ofÂ La llorona’s success and directed with flair by Fernando de Fuentes (regarded as one of the masters of early Mexican cinema),Â The Phantom of the MonasteryÂ tells the macabre tale of a troupe of hikers who become lost in a forest and take refuge in a haunted monastery. There, they encounter shape-shifting shadows, ominous sealed doorways, and a cellar crowded with coffins...\n\nAn expressionistic Gothic triumph which has tragically languished in obscurity outside of Mexico,Â The Phantom of the MonasteryÂ has now been lovingly restored and is presented on Blu-ray at long last in a world debut edition, along with a selection of illuminating extras.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY FEATURES:\n\nNew 4K restoration from the original negative by the UCLA Film & Television Archive in collaboration with the Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nVideo appreciation by Abraham Castillo Flores, head programmer of Mexico’s Morbido Fest (2022)\n\nOptional English subtitles\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet featuring a new essay by Maricruz Castro Ricalde, an archival piece by screenwriter Juan Bustillo Oro, archival articles on the film’s production and promotion, an overview of the restoration process, and an overview of contemporary critical responses\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited edition of 2,000 copies for the UK (4,000 copies for the world)\n\nA TIME FOR DYING (1969) Limited Edition Blu-ray Â (World Blu-ray premiere) | 21 March 2022 | Â£15.99\n\nThe final western from one of the genre’s greatest directors, Budd Boetticher (Ride Lonesome), and the last screen appearance of war hero-turned-movie star Audie Murphy (To Hell and Back),Â A Time for DyingÂ is an offbeat, elegiac look at the Old West, prefiguring Don Siegel’s classic western, and John Wayne’s final picture,Â The Shootist.\n\nRichard Lapp stars as a young man with fine shooting skills who crosses paths with real-life figures, such as Jesse James (played by Murphy) and Judge Roy Bean (Victor Jory), only to discover the true violence of the West.\n\nBeset by post-production and distribution problems,Â A Time for DyingÂ is overdue the recognition it deserves. This world Blu-ray debut, featuring an all-new restoration and a host of insightful extras, will finally enable the film to find its rightful audience.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY FEATURES:\n\nNew restoration from a 2K scan of the original negative by Powerhouse Films\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nAudio commentary with western experts C Courtney Joyner and Henry Parke (2022)\n\nAppreciation by filmmaker and author Christopher Petit (2022)\n\nJust Like Jesse JamesÂ (2022): Kim Newman, author ofÂ Wild West Movies, discusses the many film portrayals of the famed outlaw\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by Paul Duane, archival interviews with Budd Boetticher and Audie Murphy, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited edition of 2,000 copies for the UK (4,000 copies for the world)\n\nMAD DOG MORGAN (1976)\n\nLimited Edition Blu-ray Â (UK Blu-ray premiere) | 21 March 2022 | Â£18.99\n\nBased on the true story of Dan Morgan â the infamous Australian outlaw once described as ‘the most bloodthirsty ruffian that ever took to the bush’ âÂ Mad Dog MorganÂ provides the perfect showcase for the unique star quality of Dennis Hopper (Night Tide,Â The Last Movie).\n\nAfter witnessing a bloody massacre of Chinese workers on Australia’s goldfields, Morgan turns to a life of crime, becoming a bushranger and the scourge of the vicious authorities â and, ultimately, a local legend â leaving a bloody legacy in his wake.\n\nNominated for two Australian Film Institute Awards, including one for director Philippe Mora (The Beast Within),Â Mad Dog MorganÂ is a brutal and uncompromising slice of Ozploitation.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY FEATURES:"
