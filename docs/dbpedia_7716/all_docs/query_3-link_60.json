        "text": "Say what you will about M. Night Shyamalan – the man knows how to write zany scripts. The director has a reputation for making movies with offbeat premises, big twists and a fair dash of borderline nonsense.\n\nShyamalan’s Trap, his latest in a string of zany, twist-and-turn thrillers, is in this sense no different. But for a director who has the potential to make either great or abjectly terrible movies, it falls somewhere in the middle.\n\nIt’s got all M. Night has to offer: an instant hook, a script suffused with spectacle to the point of near-absurdity, and set pieces that simply don’t make sense (but really ham up the drama).\n\nThe film features Josh Hartnett as Cooper, an average, middle-class dad taking his daughter (Ariel Donoghue) to a concert to see Lady Raven (played by Shyamalan’s daughter Saleka).\n\nShe’s very excited, but Cooper senses something off about the atmosphere at the Tanaka Arena in Philadelphia. Security seems extra tight and middle-aged men are being whisked off by armed guards.\n\nThe twist here (as Shyamalan-ian formula dictates) is that it’s all one big sting operation to catch a serial killer named The Butcher. And Cooper, unassuming as he is, happens to be said serial killer.\n\n“He’s done it again,” they’ll say. After a filmmaking slump in the years before and after 2010 – in which he released flops like The Happening (2008), The Last Airbender (2010) and After Earth (2013) back-to-back – it’s nice to see the king of twists back in relatively good form.\n\nBecause a hook like this certainly makes this thriller thrill. Cooper, despite his average veneer, is actually a cold, calculated psychopath caught in a trap – and has to navigate the crowd, the cops and his daughter whilst searching for a means of escape.\n\nSwiping access cards, deceiving security and weaseling his way behind the scenes produces this tension that almost feels like a lost art form – the art form of the (slightly) ludicrous M. Night Shyamalan thriller.\n\nAt their best, Shyamalan’s movies delve into the fantastical but never shy away from fully exploring themselves. Everyone remembers when Bruce Willis turned out to be a ghost the whole time in The Sixth Sense. Everyone remembers when he created a gritty, no-nonsense superhero in Unbreakable (long before Nolan did). Everyone remembers when the aliens in Signs invaded Earth ... despite water being toxic to them?\n\nThat’s the thing: Sometimes Shyamalan goes a little overboard.\n\nFor every moment of intrigue Trap successfully builds – Cooper almost gets caught, Cooper’s daughter grows suspicious, he nearly escapes – there is at least one moment in which the film frankly overdoes it.\n\nWhatever momentum Trap builds up is continuously interrupted by sequences with strangely wooden dialogue or offbeat twists or dents in the narrative that don’t make sense (but serve to drive it forward).\n\nAt one point, Cooper escapes a seemingly impossible situation, as during a cutaway he simply manages to change clothes, escape a surrounded car and melt into a crowd – seemingly without anyone noticing.\n\nThis stop-and-go rhythm, like riding with a learner at driving school who hasn’t quite mastered the clutch yet, means that you’re in for a bumpy ride. Trap, more than anything else, feels overdone. There are too many twists and turns that forsake good sense for heightened action, too many moments in which the already zany plot goes a step too far and stops you in your tracks.\n\n“It’s a feature, not a bug,” they’ll say, meaning that this is what makes the (slightly) ludicrous M. Night Shyamalan so special. But Shyamalan isn’t the big name he was in the early 2000s. If we’re being honest, he’s never quite gotten back to the level he was operating at before the 2010ish slump.\n\nBut considering that the director’s still getting more recent projects like these greenlit by big studios – all the power to him. M. Night’s films have been gradually getting better again (think of films like Split (2016) or Old (2021), which are also whacky Shyamalan plots that overdo themselves), and so the best we can do is to hold out.\n\nTrap might not be a home run. It might not even be a particularly memorable part of Shyamalan’s filmography. But the director’s got a knack for writing and directing films that delve into the speculative and the quirky and the fantastical, and if trends are to be trusted we might soon have another certified Shyamalan Classic on our hands before he decides to call it quits.\n\nLet the man cook. Let M. Night continue to write his wild scripts that squeeze every drop of drama out of a given premise. Trap, for all its Shyamalan-ian over-indulgences, nevertheless works as a thriller with a killer hook."
