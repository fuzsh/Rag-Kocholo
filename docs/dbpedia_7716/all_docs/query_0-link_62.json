        "text": "Anyone familiar with Whit Stillman's captivating 1990 \"Metropolitan\" knows that his precise, urbane intelligence is a true tonic on screen. Both of his films, the second of which is the equally appealing new \"Barcelona,\" have an offbeat, amusing specificity that is distinctive and rare.\n\nEach film is firmly rooted in subject matter of no great universal familiarity. (\"Metropolitan,\" set in the uneasy world of New York debutantes and their escorts, was by far the simpler to describe.) And each radiates the film maker's fervent, occasionally crazy confidence in the legitimacy of his interests. Mr. Stillman can be dead serious about, say, NATO without sacrificing a gently sardonic tone. And he's capable of linking theories of salesmanship with thoughts of love. He makes odd, tender, uncategorizable films that must utterly confound the market researchers whose opinions shape Hollywood. Good.\n\nBarcelona,\" a slender, deadpan romantic comedy with an eye toward world affairs, centers on the bickering relationship between two cousins. It begins when Fred (Chris Eigeman) appears on the Spanish doorstep of his cousin Ted (Taylor Nichols), who greets him with the old saw about house guests stinking after three days. Fred moves in anyway. Ted is a prim, fussy sort with a lot of pent-up resentments and furtive habits, all of which Fred is happy to ignore. Fred, a naval officer, has come to Barcelona as an advance man for the Sixth Fleet, and he has more to worry about than Ted's bad mood.\n\nSet during \"the last decade of the Cold War,\" \"Barcelona\" manages to find comic material in the anti-American attitudes then prevalent in Spain. Since both Fred and Ted quickly become involved with smart, self-assured, sexually liberated Spanish women, they find themselves on the defensive both personally and politically. Fred, the more belligerent of the cousins, loudly defends his opinions no matter what the cost. \"I think it's well known that anti-Americanism has its roots in sexual impotence, at least in Europe,\" he says pointedly on one occasion.\n\nNaturally, Ted is often embarrassed by Fred's behavior. It doesn't help their case with Montserrat (Tushka Bergen), the beauty who takes up with Ted even though she also lives with Ramon (Pep Munne), when Fred decides to pick a fight with Ramon and his passionately anti-American friends. At an outing in the country, ants are used in an analogy for American imperialism; Ramon maintains that Americans are like a red-ant minority oppressing a black-ant majority. Fred's answer to this is to squash the ants outright. \"I did not confirm their worst assumption,\" Fred insists afterward, when Ted tries to scold him. \"I am their worst assumption.\"\n\nHe might well be, in a film more strident and less deft than this one. But Mr. Eigeman is the film's funniest performer, and his rapport with Mr. Nichols is much too droll to have a bullying edge. These two, who also played petty minor characters in \"Metropolitan,\" have the kind of flat, absurdist comic timing that perfectly suits Mr. Stillman's buttoned-down sensibility. Neither the actors nor the film makers ever nudge the audience for laughs. \"Barcelona,\" like \"Metropolitan,\" indulges in long, hair-splitting discussions without resorting to broad gags or worrying about wearing out its welcome.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
