        "text": "A Moody Christmas\n\nOnce a year we visit the Moodys as they come together to share this universally celebrated holiday, stuffed full of all the fun, fights, bad gifts, boring uncles, overbearing in-laws, shocking family secrets and bizarre eccentricities that any family who has experienced the melting pot of Christmas Day will relate to. Because while in theory Christmas is a time for family to share and celebrate, in practice it’s often a day spent with relatives you hardly know, where dirty laundry is aired, family rifts resurface, strangers are forced to act like family, and celebratory drinks can disintegrate into drunken rows. As often happens at the Moodys...Each episode takes place on Christmas Day, or during the Christmas period, and 12 months passes between every episode.\n\nChildren of the Revolution\n\nFew ever knew that Josef Stalin's last conscious night on the planet was spent in the loving and devoted arms of a young Australian, Joan Fraser. Fewer still knew that their love child would bring Australia to the brink of civil war. Until now...\n\nMuriel's Wedding\n\nMuriel, a contemporary Cinderella, is a shy young woman living in the seaside resort of Porpoise Spit, a suburban wonderland of shopping malls, marine parks and holiday homes where the excessive expectations of her friends and family cause her to take refuge in a dreamworld of Abba songs and the search for a Prince Charming who will rescue her from anonymity.\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\n\nTwo drag queens and a transsexual leave Sydney in a bus called 'Priscilla', and travel across half of Australia to climb a rock and put on a show at a resort in the middle of the country. Along the way, they break down, paint the bus lavender, dress up a lot, perform where they shouldn't and encounter hilarity, hostility and incomprehension. THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT is a road movie musical about a collision between three people in the wrong costumes and an environment that does not want them.\n\nThe Castle\n\nThe Kerrigans live at 3 Highview Crescent, Coolaroo. Their home is right next to an airport, in fact, jumbo jets land right outside the back fence...but to the Kerrigans this humble abode is their castle. This peaceful happy-family existence is turned upside down when the Kerrigans and their neighbours receive a Compulsory Acquisition Notice, advising they will have to leave their home and despite the compensation involved, they decide to fight. Fight for their home, their family's way of life, their memories...their castle.\n\nPlease Like Me\n\nInspired by the award-winning stand-up comedy of Josh Thomas, PLEASE LIKE ME is a series about growing up quickly, and about realising that your parents are not heroes, but dopes with no idea whats going on — just like you.\n\nJohn Callahan's QUADS!\n\nQuadriplegic, recovering alcoholic, lapsed Catholic Reilly O'Reilly is a man who doesn't take to labels sitting down - not by choice anyway. He and his differently abled friends find that sharing their lavish residence 'Maimed Manor' is a constant battle with con-men, do-gooders and deviants - and then there is the outside world to deal with as well.\n\nThe Librarians series 1\n\nFrances O’Brien, devout Catholic and panic disorder sufferer, runs a very tight ship at the Middleton Interactive Learning Centre, a modern outer suburban library. Despite the chronic vandalism, the dysfunctional staff and her own particular challenges with the ever-growing Muslim community, Frances wears her Head Librarian’s badge with relish. No more so than during the heady period leading up to Book Week – precisely the moment her life suddenly takes a turn for the worst. Frances’ ex-best friend from childhood turns up wanting a job in her library."
