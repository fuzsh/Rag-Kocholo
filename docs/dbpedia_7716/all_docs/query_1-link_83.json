        "text": "“Chappie” ain’t crappy.\n\nSorry. Couldn’t help myself. I’ll start again.\n\n“Chappie,” South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp’s amusingly oddball sci-fi film, deals with artificial intelligence. If possible, should robots be made to have thoughts and feelings – minds and emotions of their own? If you think of HAL in Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the answer appears to be no. “Chappie,” on the other hand, seems to embrace the idea.\n\nThe setting is Johannesburg of the near future. Crime is at an all-time high – until mass-produced robotic police are brought in and set things back in order. These are robots built solely to follow the commands of their human counterparts.\n\nBut their chief architect, Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), has greater aspirations. He’s come up with a way to create a robot with thoughts and feelings. When the CEO of his company (Sigourney Weaver) refuses to fund the project (they’re doing well enough selling the regular robots to the police), Deon steals a damaged robot that’s been placed on the scrap heap.\n\nBefore Deon can do anything further, though, he’s kidnapped by a trio of punk-styled criminals, Ninja (played by Ninja), Yolandi (Yo-Landi Visser) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo). They force Deon to program a robot for their own criminal purposes, and the result is Chappie (Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley).\n\nChappie comes to life with the mind of an infant, but progresses quickly through childhood. He brings out maternal feelings in Yolandi, and paternal feelings of the Godlike variety in Deon, who reminds everyone, including Chappie, that he’s the robot’s creator. Ninja, the violent leader of the gang who always seems on the verge of shooting Deon in the head, has a more ruthless approach to Chappie, though he still takes on the role of “Daddy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Deon’s rival, Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman, sporting a major mullet), discovers what Deon’s been up to with Chappie – and he doesn’t like it.\n\n“Chappie” is a strange hybrid of a film. It’s rated R, for its violence and crude language, and yet our robot hero, with his sweet, goofy innocence, seems like a character out of a movie geared for children. “Chappie” deals directly with controversies that could arise with the development of artificial intelligence, but it’s more a gritty-action “Robocop”-type film than a thoughtful sci-fi picture. The three criminals can be cold-blooded killers, but they provide some of the funnier, more lighthearted moments.\n\nThe best moments are when Ninja trains Chappie to be a badass.\n\n“Chappie, if you want to be in the gang, you have to be cool, like Daddy!” Ninja says. “Look how Daddy walks! Look how cool it’s! Need to keep it gangsta’, Chappie!”\n\nThough Patel, who also stars in “The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” (see review on this page), is likable as always, Ninja (the actor) and Visser steal the film as offbeat outlaws. (According to imdb.com, they’re married in real life and perform in the South African rap/rave group Die Antwood.)\n\nThis is one of those movies in which the parts are better than the whole, and that’s OK.\n\nWhat: “Chappie”\n\nStar rating: ***\n\nStarring: Dev Patel, Sharlto Copley, Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser, Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirected by: Neill Blomkamp\n\nWritten by: Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell\n\nRunning time: 120 minutes\n\nRating: R (for violence, language and brief nudity)\n\nWhere: Flagship Cinemas New Bedford, AMC Dartmouth Mall 12, Flagship Cinemas Wareham\n\nNow Showing"
