        "text": "Sandra Nettelbeck has made a first feature that crosses borders and catches the light according to the color of the ambient culture. It's the little European engine that could and did pick up steam — and several prizes — on the festival circuit. \"Drei Sterne,\" in the original German, went from Berlin to Locarno, where it was called \"Bella Martha,\" and on to Toronto, which the director calls the breakthrough event.\n\nThe movie's Canadian title, \"Comme il faut,\" doesn't quite fit the heroine, a madwoman of haute cuisine who works her wizardry in a stodgy Hamburg restaurant. \"Mostly Martha,\" the English title, best suits this daring chef. The film was warmly received in the United States.\n\n\"It was refreshing to have a dialogue with the audience,\" said the director. \"This never happened in Germany, because people didn't know what to make of a movie that's not quite a comedy, nor really drama. They saw it as cliché, which disappointed me because I think my movie is more complicated. In America, they picked up on the subtleties of the story, and how the film plays with clichés.\"\n\nNow \"Chère Martha\" is finally opening in the land of food and wine, where critics tend to treat romantic comedy as old hat, and look down their noses at foreigners who mess with their recipes.\n\n\"I had almost given up on a French release,\" said Nettelbeck, whose favorite director is François Truffaut. \"Truffaut made the movies I always wanted to make, old-fashioned storytelling. I think I'm old-fashioned too, and I like old-fashioned images. He was totally in love with his characters, which is just how I feel about my characters.\"\n\nBorn in Hamburg, Nettelbeck, 37, went to boarding school in England, studied film in San Francisco and now lives in Berlin. She is a slight, intense blonde, in contrast to her voluptuous dark heroine, played majestically by Martina Gedeck.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
