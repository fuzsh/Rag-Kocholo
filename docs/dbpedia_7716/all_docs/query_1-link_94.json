        "text": "Once upon a time, it was clever to say, “Hey, you know what’s actually a Christmas movie? ‘Die Hard!’”\n\nThat time has passed. No knock on Nokatomi, but the “Die Hard” thing just isn’t a contrarian opinion anymore. It’s been mainstream for a while now. So when that one guy brings up yet again this year, you need to be ready with some real outliers.\n\nHere is a stocking stuffed full of them: Christmas movies that aren’t Christmas movies at all but wouldn’t be the same without a jingle bell or two.\n\n“Stalag 17,” 1953, Not Rated. Due to the age of this classic, let there be no pretense the next few sentences contain any spoilers. Y’all have had 67 years to get up to speed. A group of American prisoners in a Nazi POW camp have figured out they have a spy in their midst. Shortly before Christmas they pulverize the wrong guy, William Holden’s enterprising black-marketeer J.J. Sefton, and use his stock of goods in their Christmas party. It’s left to Sgt. Sefton to turn the tables on the real spy, and his parting speech to his colleagues is appropriately cynical. “Stalag 17” really is a marvel. It has abundant comic relief without trivializing the seriousness of the setting the way “Hogan’s Heroes” later did. It’s a heck of a war movie, and it’s a prison drama where the life-and-death stakes are never far from anyone’s minds.\n\n“Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” 2005, Rated R for language, violence and sexuality/nudity. “It’s hard to believe it was just last Christmas that me and Harmony changed the world,” Robert Downey Jr. says as he begins his narration of this convoluted tale. “And we didn’t mean to. And it didn’t last long. A thing like that can’t.” Downey’s Harry Lockhart is a small-time crook who stumbles into an audition while fleeing police and gets the part. He starts hanging out with real-life detective Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) and next thing you know he’s wrapped up in a real-life murder mystery involving one Harmony Faith Lane, played by Michelle Monaghan, who arguably deserves top billing. (Downey basically plays himself: There’s really not much to distinguish his Harry Lockhart from the Tony Stark he gave us a few years later.) The weird, decadent Christmas-in-LaLa-Land vibe ramps up as the movie proceeds and so does the body count, as this meta-Hollywood-noir spins more and more out of control. It’s a fun ride.\n\n“The Ice Harvest,” 2005, Rated R for violence, language and sexuality/nudity. Director Harold Ramis’ entry in the perfect crime/”what could possibly go wrong” genre has so much in common with “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” that they’d make a great double feature: It also has people losing fingers, escalating depravity and bullets erupting from unexpected places (though not, in this case, from anyone’s underpants). But you’d want to show this one first because it’s a much grimier, more profane and bleaker piece of work. John Cusack’s Charlie Arglist is a bad egg to start with, a mobbed-up attorney who frequents seedy strip clubs and who has just ripped off his boss to the tune of $2.1 million. All Charlie has to do is be cool for one night before leaving town. Needless to say, the universe conspires against that and Charlie has to go to greater and greater extremes to keep his rotten dream alive, including the part about having a future with femme fatale Renata Crest, engagingly played by Connie Nielson. Billy Bob Thornton, as his borderline sociopathic partner Vic Cavanaugh, has a marvelous little monologue that is the exact counterpoint to the moral lesson of Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol:” Good or bad, we all die in the end, so regrets are utterly pointless, he says. And then there’s the one and only Randy Quaid, emerging as a murderous heavy in the final act. “Only morons are nice at Christmas,” he says, by way of eliminating any hope of mercy. “And that’s a lot of people too, Charlie, especially in Kansas. But not everybody.”\n\n“The Lion in Winter,” 1969, Rated PG. This one’s a little bit of a stretch. King Henry II (a heavily bearded Peter O’Toole) has let his wife Queen Eleanor (Katharine Hepburn) out of prison for Christmas, but not to be nice: She has to be in the mix while he hammers out a plan for which of their three sons will succeed him. It’s hard to go wrong with a cast this stacked: Anthony Hopkins plays one of the sons, future James Bond Timothy Dalton brings ferocity to the role of French King Philip II, and a couple other actors hold their own amid the heavyweights. There are some downsides. While the movie may accurately portray what a rustic affair it was to be king of England in 1183, the production values are unimpressive. Its near-complete reliance on declamatory dialogue makes it feel like a filmed version of the play it’s based on rather than a full-fledged movie. The Christmas setting, which seems important up front, fades away amid all the shouting. Basically, you spend two hours with a messed-up family whose members don’t feel connected unless they’re goading one another to the breaking point. If Carly Rae Jepsen’s “It’s Not Christmas Till Somebody Cries” is your idea of the perfect holiday song, you might enjoy this.\n\n“The Godfather,” 1972, Rated R. This classic sprawls over so much cultural territory, how could it not fall across Christmas too? It’s not a huge part of the story, but watching a guy strap on a bulletproof vest and check his revolver as a crooner sings “from now on our troubles will be miles away” is the kind of touch that made this a classic in the first place. Also, hey, it’s all about family.\n\n“Lethal Weapon,” 1987, Rated R. A year before “Die Hard” this buddy-cop shoot-em-up blazed the trail. Maybe you remember the closing scene with Mel Gibson’s slightly crazy Martin Riggs joining Danny Glover’s Roger Murtaugh and his family for Christmas dinner. But did you remember “Jingle Bell Rock” playing over the opening credits, right before the film’s first victim took her coked-up dive off a high rise? Did you remember the shootout in the Christmas tree lot? Did you remember all the Christmas lights during the final beatdown between Gibson and Gary Busey?\n\n“Batman Returns,” 1992, Rated PG-13. Director Tim Burton got to be really Tim Burtony in his second Batman franchise outing, and probably what you remember most is the sheer grotesquery of Danny DeVito’s Penguin. To be fair, it’s the main reason to revisit the flick. But Christmas is the backdrop: It’s during a Christmas speech from “Gotham’s own Santa Claus” (Christopher Walken as Max Shreck) that chaos erupts; it’s at a Christmas ball that Michael Keaton’s Bruce Wayne and Michelle Pfeiffer’s Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) have a conversation about masks, mistletoe and kisses.\n\n“Gremlins,” 1984, Rated PG. If you’re of a certain age, all you really recall is that this movie scared the stuffing out of you back in 1984. But the Christmas connection is undeniable: Cute little Gizmo starts out as a Christmas present before people fail to follow the rules, and he morphs into a flood of evil little monsters.\n\n“Edward Scissorhands,” 1990, Rated PG-13. It’s not a Christmas movie, but a significant part of the action does take place at Christmastime -- and it’s hard to imagine those scenes being rewritten to work an any other time of year.\n\nYou could make a case for “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” but the Christmas break was a structural turning point for all the early Potter novels, so that’s a little different. “Trading Places” has some scenes with Dan Aykroyd as a really gross, suicidal Santa. “Iron Man 3?” Sure, why not, it ends with a torrent of joy melodramatic enough to embarrass Dickens.\n\nThere are probably more you could put on the list. Arguing about what constitutes a proper non-Christmas Christmas movie is one of those gifts you give yourself. And ‘tis the season to be generous."
