        "text": "The Mimic is a hilarious movie. The story follows Thomas Sadoski as The Narrator. He is convinced that his new neighbor (Jake Robinson as “The Kid”) is a sociopath. He decides to investigate the newcomer to find out the truth. This leads to an outrageous series of events that leads to a discovery The Narrator could never have expected.\n\nThe film movies at an oddly quick pace. What makes it so strange is it is not the plot that moves rapidly but rather the conversation. The Mimic makes it sound like Rory and Lorelai are trying out a new language. (Conversely, there are times when the story moves rather slow.) This leads to witty banter that rapidly goes back and forth and some funny exchanges.\n\nThe other side to this is some of the jokes may not stick the landing. This is not due to The Mimic not being funny. The films is very humorous and Sadoski and Robinson play off each other perfectly. It is more about the jokes not having time to resonate with the audience. Instead of letting things settle, the film almost seems like it is in a rush to move on the next joke.\n\nThis is a shame since the film is so funny. There tends to be an over reliance on people misunderstanding comments (lots of “and don’t call me Shirley” type jokes), but The Mimic is laugh out loud funny at times. There are lots of funny characters and there really are not any bad jokes. Strangely The Mimic is not really suspenseful. The movie is appropriately structured like a book with different sections being another chapter. This makes the film seem like a series of vignettes that are tied together. Despite this, the movie is well written leading to an enjoyable experience."
