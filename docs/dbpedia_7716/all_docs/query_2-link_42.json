        "text": "With the children nestled all snug in their beds, isnât it time for more sinister streaming? SPYSCAPE has handpicked 25 eclectic movies set during the holidays from irreverent crime-drama In Bruges to classics like The Conversation and modern-day masterpieces.\n\nâ\n\n1. In Bruges (2008)Â\n\nWhen a hit job goes awry, Irish assassins Ray (Colin Farrel) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) await orders from the boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium - the last place Ray wants to be. Director Martin McDonagh visited Bruges on a day trip from London and was struck equally by its Gothic beauty and the sheer boredom of being in a place where there isnât much to do aside from visiting churches and museums. The idea morphed into his black comedy with its two irresistible main characters - the culture lover and the drunk. (Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\n2. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)â\n\nA mole is operating within MI6 and George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is on the hunt. The Christmas party is a particular delight with John le CarrÃ©âs cameo appearance. Did MI6 have such parties when the author worked as a spy? âOh yes,â le CarrÃ© told The Spectator, recalling that one year the party got so out of hand Scotland Yard was called in to keep MI6 in check. (Netflix, YouTube, Apple TV, Google Play, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\n3. Three Days of the Condor (1975)\n\nThree Days of the Condor reflects the anxieties and conspiracies of â70s post-Watergate America. CIA codebreaker Joe Turner (Robert Redford) finds his co-workers murdered and suspects his Agency handlers... or are they just posing as his handlers? A climactic meeting unfolds in an alley (formerly situated between the Twin Towers) which director Sydney Pollack described as âspooky and eerie and weirdâ. Parts of the film were also shot in the former World Trade Centerâs mezzanine and towers. (Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n4. The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)Â\n\nâSamuel L. Jackson considers The Long Kiss Goodnight to be one of his favorite films - and heâs done a fair few. This highly underrated espionage action movie (think Geena Davis as a female Bourne) is set during the Christmas holidays as Samantha Caine (Davis) suffers a concussion in a car accident. She recovers physically but doesnât understand the remarkable skills she possesses. Rotten Tomato readers consider it âsharp-witted, and fueled by enjoyably over-the-top actionâ. (Prime Video)Â\n\nâ\n\n5. Twelve Monkeys (1999)\n\nPrisoner James Cole (Bruce Willis) travels from a virus-ravaged 2035 to 1990 to prevent a deadly plague. Mistakenly imprisoned in a mental facility, he enlists Dr. Kathryn Railly's help (Madeleine Stowe) and unravels clues about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Balancing on the edge of sanity, Cole questions the reality of his mission in this thought-provoking sci-fi thriller. Also starring Brad Pitt. (Peacock, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Apple TV, Prime Video, Vudu.)\n\nâ\n\n6. The Package (1990)â\n\nâGene Hackman fans will appreciate The Package (1990). The former real-life US Marine stars as Army Sgt. Johnny Gallagher who must bring criminal Thomas Boyette (Tommy Lee Jones) home from Europe after a prisoner swap. Boyette disappears, however, leading Gallagher to chase him down to Chicago and into a deadly spy plot. Dennis Franz is in his element as a police officer who doesnât play by the rules. (Prime Video, Apple TV, Vudu)\n\nâ\n\n7. The Conversation (1975)â\n\nThis Francis Ford Coppola classic also stars Hackman as a surveillance expert and spy-for-hire with Harrison Ford as a menacing baddie in a psychological thriller involving privacy, murder, and the dark side of corporate espionage. It is impossible for Hackman to turn in a bad performance. âYou cannot play a lie,â Hackman once told an interviewer. âYou must play some kind of truth, and if you make the right choice, the audience will read it right.â (Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple)Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n8. Reindeer Games (2000)\n\nIn John Frankenheimerâs Reindeer Games (2000), Ben Affleck's character is paroled on Christmas Eve only to get entangled in a casino heist on an Indian reservation. All he wants is a peaceful holiday, but love interest Charlize Theron and her psychotic brother (Gary Sinise), have other plans. You may also want to seek out the director's cut, surpassing the original theatrical version. (YouTube, Apple+, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\n9. Black Christmas (1974) â\n\nBlack Christmas revolves around sorority sisters terrorized by threatening phone calls during the holiday season. The mysterious caller becomes increasingly menacing, and the sisters realize they are in grave danger. The film isnât for everyone but it is considered a classic in the horror genre and is notable for its influence on subsequent slasher films. (YouTube)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n10. Blow Out (1981)\n\nBrian De Palma's Blow Out opens with a scene from a slasher film-within-a-film, Co-ed Frenzy - channeling Black Christmas and Halloween in its stylish point-of-view shots. The movie explores Jack Terry's (John Travolta's) quest for the perfect scream, delving into the manipulation of truth and the impact of powerful conspiracies on ordinary citizens, set against the backdrop of a post-Vietnam and Watergate America. Unmissable. (Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n11. The Shepherd (2023)\n\nStill going strong 40 years later, John Travolta's The Shepherd follows a military pilot on a journey home on December 24 when his jet malfunctions over the North Sea. A glimmer of hope appears in the form of a Mosquito spy plane but is it too little, too late? The movie, based on the novel by real-life military spy Frederick Forsyth, struck a chord with Travolta who experienced his own high-in-the-sky terror when his personal jet experienced a malfunction over Washington, D.C. (Disney+)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n12. Brazil (1985)Â\n\nTerry Gilliam's sci-fi masterpiece Brazil opens with a family watching A Christmas Carol but the idyllic scene unravels into a dystopian world. The protagonist, Sam Lowry, works for the Ministry of Information and becomes entangled in a surreal and bureaucratic nightmare as he navigates a chaotic and oppressive society. If you love the movie, poke around a bit. Youâll find the Criterion Collection edition of Brazil, and two more versions - a âfinalâ cut running 142 minutes, and a Love Conquers All version at just over 90 minutes.
