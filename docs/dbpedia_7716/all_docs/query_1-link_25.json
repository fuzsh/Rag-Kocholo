        "text": "Two groundbreaking films by Louisiana filmmaker Glen Pitre, once thought lost to the ravages of Hurricane Katrina, are set to make a return to the big screen. The films, both shot entirely in Cajun French with English subtitles, will be re-premiering at the Prytania Theatre on February 24 and 25 as part of the New Orleans French Film Festival.\n\nBelieved to be lost forever in the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina, these cinematic treasures have undergone a remarkable resurrection thanks to a grant from the Golden Globes Foundation to IndieCollect, a Manhattan-based nonprofit specializing in the restoration of American Independent Cinema classics. Experts scoured archives in Louisiana and UCLA, as well as private collections, to recover the original film negatives. The soundtrack was rescued in Los Angeles, the picture restored in New York, and subtitles meticulously recreated in New Orleans.\n\nThe two films, originally paired for their theatrical release in 1981, captivated audiences with their unique blend of storytelling and cultural authenticity. Dubbed “gumbo westerns” by the press, they even outgrossed Star Wars in bayou towns like Galliano, Houma, and Abbeville before garnering international acclaim.\n\n“La Fièvre Jaune (Yellow Fever)” transports viewers to the year 1897, immersing them in the gripping tale of Pitre’s great-grandfather’s defiance of quarantine during an epidemic. Echoing the challenges of the COVID-19 lockdown, the film offers a poignant exploration of fear, resilience, and the struggle to maintain normalcy in extraordinary times.\n\n“Huit Piastres et Demie! ($8.50 a barrel!)” delves into the Shrimp War of 1938, weaving a tapestry of conflicting memories as two elderly neighbors recount their versions of the historic fisherman’s strike. Against a backdrop of vintage clothing, antique vehicles, and bustling fishing boats, the film unravels the complex relationship between history and myth.\n\nDirector Glen Pitre will be present at both screenings to engage with audiences, offering insights into the films, the Cajun French dialect, and the evolution of American Independent Cinema.\n\nThe screenings are made possible by the New Orleans Film Society, with generous support from The Historic New Orleans Collection. The New Orleans Film Society’s year-round programs, including the New Orleans French Film Festival, are made possible by grants from the City of New Orleans and the Louisiana Division of the Arts.\n\nDon’t miss the chance to experience these cinematic gems on the big screen. French Film Festival screenings will be held at the Prytania Theatre, located at 5339 Prytania St. in uptown New Orleans.\n\nScreening Schedule:\n\nHuit Piastres et Demie! ($8.50 a barrel!)\n\nSat, Feb 24th, 6:15 PM @ Prytania Theatre\n\nTue, Feb 27th, 6:00 PM @ Prytania Theatre\n\nLa Fièvre Jaune (Yellow Fever)\n\nSun, Feb 25th, 2:45 PM @ Prytania Theatre\n\nWed, Feb 28th, 12:30 PM @ Prytania Theatre"
