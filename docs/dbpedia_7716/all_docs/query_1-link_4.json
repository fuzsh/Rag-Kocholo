        "text": "Congratulations Aaron Small and Jonas Ecker for punching your ticket to the Paris Olympics in the K2 500m. It was fun to film with both of you and Ward1 Studios to promote Phonak's newest waterproof hearing aid. Good luck in Paris!\n\nOffbeat was created to help share stories about good people doing good things. We're really proud to have worked alongside some amazing folks at DH to create a 0:30 spot as part of the Friends for Life Campaign, an educational campaign about the effects of drugs like fentanyl. The campaign recently was awarded a Silver Anthem Award. Read the article below and check out the spot on our website!\n\nOffbeat is excited to announce that a short film we produced won a Jury Prize at the Spokane International Film Festival! Impenetrable is a dark comedy short film based on the true story of its creator, Geena Pietromonaco, and the relatable story of one’s frustration with their own body.\n\nWe're so happy for our friend, Roger Nyhus, for being confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. It was fun to film your confirmation and hear all the great things the community had to say about you. Roger's former communications business, Nyhus, took a chance on Offbeat many years ago and we've learned so much working with you and your team since then. Best of luck!\n\nThere’s a new website in town! Explore what goes on behind the scenes at Offbeat Films. Whether working with us or watching from home, we hope to give you a meaningful experience, one we would call \"Offbeat\". Check it out and let us know what you think.\n\nThank you AdAge for the writeup about our collaboration with Leica Camera North America, TownsendHurst, and Terry LaRue. Our team was grateful to be included to help make this film a reality. Check out the article below and the film on our website:"
