ABOUT OBC

Off Beat Cinema is a two-hour hosted movie show that airs on television stations throughout North America on the retroTV Network along with a series of independent stations. Off Beat Cinema promises to show you “the movies that must be shown” – the good, the bad and the foreign (in their original languages, of course!)

Off Beat Cinema began on October 31, 1993 as a diversion from the flood of late night infomercials that seemed to consume the available airwaves of television’s last cool frontier: late night! Once a hip haven for insomniacs, second shifters, beatniks and kids who would sneak back to the TV when their parents were solidly in dreamland, late night television had become a vast wasteland of hucksters hawking everything from cooling systems to spray-on hair in a can.

The show is filmed in the Hungry Ear Coffee House, a whacked-out poetry basement located somewhere in downtown Buffalo, NY. The Hungry Ear Coffee House is a mad pad, Dad… and the kind of place where Boris Karloff could sit with Ed Wood and discuss the transcendence of the ego and how that applies to Moe Howard getting a cream pie in the face. A comfortable pad where former Beatle Pete Best could sit with the Goo Goo Dolls and discuss the merits of 3D giant insect fear films. I think you get the picture…

The beatniks also like to take the show on the road with gigs at Canalside or at far-out locations like Hot Mama's Canteen! Check out the fun in the portfolio section.
