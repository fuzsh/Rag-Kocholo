Offbeat is one of the better of these British Crime-thrillers from the late 50's, early 60s. It includes polished burglaries, undercover cops, wrestling gyms, billiard hails, tunnelling, smart criminals and the hottie Mai Zetterling. It's very much in-line with the Noir style and is competently told. This is a good film - and deserved to be longer than it's B-limitations.

The DVD is yet another competent and watchable, reasonably-priced, single-layered SD PAL transfer from Network out of the UK. It's a clean anamorphic (1.66:1) image, a bit thin and glossy but plenty of depth. It's quite sharp and very pleasing in-motion.

Audio is clear and clean with a light jazz score by Ken Jones (Indiscreet) There are no subtitles on the region 2, PAL, disc.

Extras include an image gallery of lobby cards and poster plus a 'synopsis' PDF at the root of the SD disc.

The film may be the best of these short British crime-drams that I have seen so far - The Teckman Mystery (1954), Do You Know This Voice? (1964), Circle of Danger (1951), Murder on Monday (1952). Although I like them all - to date - this stands out for its well told story and 'dark-side' characters. Recommended!
