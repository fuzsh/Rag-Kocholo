        "text": "“I was born a Hindu, no doubt. No one can undo the fact. But I am also a Muslim because I am a good Hindu. In the same way, I am also a Parsi and a Christian too.”\n\n- Mahatma Gandhi 30 May 1947\n\n------------------------\n\n“We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”\n\n- Kurt Vonnegut\n\n------------------------\n\n\"Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusion about its condition is the demand to give up a condition which needs illusions.\"\n\n- Karl Marx Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\n\n------------------------"
