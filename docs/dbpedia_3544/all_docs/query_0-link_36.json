        "text": "Buy Now (Indian Buyers)Add to Cart\n\nProfusely illustrated.\n\nBombay opened up a new world to the Goan, both Christian and Hindu. They rode high on the crest of the wave of priviledge, grabbed opportunity, worked hard at whatever they took up — not baulking at menial service, so long as it improved their standing.\n\nThus they were able to set up their own educational institutions, their own press. Other Goans strove to rectify their society, to actively promote education at the highest level, and organise reform movements. This book focuses primarily on the nineteenth century.\n\nBombay’s Beginnings Finding Their Way Early Professions The Rich and Famous Intellectual Stalwarts\n\nEminent Physicians Some Notables Goan Press and Literature Marathi Press and Literature Early Churches, Priests\n\nWelfare Services Sports and Entertainment Bibliography: Books, Journals, Articles, Unpublished Theses About the Author\n\nDr. (Mrs.) Teresa Albuquerque is a Fellow of the Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture, St. Xavier’s College, Bombay, and a member of the Bombay Museum Society, the Asiatic Society of Bombay, the Church History Association of India, the Heras Society and the Bombay Local History Society.
