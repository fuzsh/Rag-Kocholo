Plot[]

Confidence man S. Quentin Quale is heading west to find his fortune, but is short ten dollars for a train ticket. In the railroad station, he encounters brothers Joseph and Rusty Panello and attempts to swindle their money, but the two manage to swindle Quale's money. The Panellos are friends with an old miner named Dan Wilson whose near worthless property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. They loan him their last ten dollars for a grubstake and he gives them the deed to the Gulch as collateral. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival and beau to his granddaughter Eve Wilson, Terry Turner has contacted the railway and persuaded them to build through the gulch, making the deed holder rich. After crooked railroad executive John Beecher and shady saloon owner "Red" Baxter manage to steal the deed, Quale and the Panello brothers work with Terry and Eve to retrieve the deed.
