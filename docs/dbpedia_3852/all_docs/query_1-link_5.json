        "text": "The military history of the Philippines is characterized by wars between Philippine kingdoms[1] and its neighbors in the precolonial era and then a period of struggle against colonial powers such as Spain and the United States, occupation by the Empire of Japan during World War II and participation in Asian conflicts post-World War II such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Philippines has also battled a communist insurgency and a secessionist movement by Muslims in the southern portion of the country.\n\nPrehistoric period (before 1000 BC – 900 AD)\n\n[edit]\n\nNegritos were among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, descendants of the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along southern Asia to the now sunken landmasses of Sundaland and Sahul area around 48,000 to 5000 BC.[2] The first Austronesians reached the Philippines at around 2200 BC, settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon.[3][4] From there, they rapidly spread downwards to the rest of the islands of the Philippines. They assimilated earlier Negritos that arrived during the Paleolithic, resulting in the modern Filipino ethnic groups that all display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups.[5]\n\nBy 1000 BC, the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had developed into four distinct kinds of peoples: tribal groups, such as the Aetas, Ilongots and the Mangyan who depended on hunter-gathering and were concentrated in forests; warrior societies, such as the Isneg and Kalinga who practiced social ranking and ritualized warfare and roamed the plains; the petty plutocracy of the Ifugao Cordillera Highlanders, who occupied the mountain ranges of Luzon; and the harbor principalities of the estuarine civilizations such as the Tagalogs, Visayans, Taūsugs, Maranaos and the Maguindanaons that grew along rivers and seashores while participating in trans-island maritime trade.[6] It was also during the first millennium BC that early metallurgy was said to have reached the archipelagos of maritime Southeast Asia via trade with India.[7][8]\n\nArchaeological findings dating from prehistoric eras have discovered a variety of stone and metal weaponry, such as axes, arrows and spearheads. Usually used for hunting, they also allowed tribes to battle with each other. Some more elaborate bronze pieces, such as axes and swords, were also part of the native weaponry. The making of swords involved elaborate rituals that were based mainly on the auspicious conjunctions of planets. The passage of the sword from the maker entailed a mystical ceremony that was coupled with tribal beliefs. The lowlanders of Luzon use the kampilan, bararao and panabas, while the Moros and animists of the South still continue the tradition of making kris.[citation needed]\n\nPre-colonial period (900 AD to 1565)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Warfare in pre-colonial Philippines\n\nMa-i and Bruneian alliance against China\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the 800s, British Historian Robert Nicholl citing Arab chronicler Al Ya'akubi, had written that on those years, the kingdoms of Muja (Then Pagan Brunei/Vijayapura) and Mayd (Ma-i) waged war against the Chinese Empire.[9]: 38\n\nKedatuan of Madja-as against Chola Occupied Srivijaya\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Indian Chola invasion of Srivijaya (1025 AD), Datu Puti led some dissident datus from Borneo (including present day Brunei which then was the location of the Vijayapura state which was a local colony of the Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire)[10] and Sumatra in a rebellion against Rajah Makatunao who was a Chola appointed local Rajah. This oral legend of ancient Hiligaynons rebelling against Rajah Makatunao have corroboration in Chinese records during the Song Dynasty when Chinese scholars recorded that the ruler during a February 1082 AD diplomatic meeting, was Seri Maharaja, and his descendant was Rajah Makatunao and was together with Sang Aji (grandfather to Sultan Muhammad Shah).[11] According to the Maragtas the dissidents against new Rajah's rule and their retinue, tried to revive Srivijaya in a new country called Madja-as in the Visayas islands (an archipelago named after Srivijaya) in the Philippines. Seeing how the actual Srivijayan Empire reached even the outer coast of Borneo, which is already neighboring the Philippines, Historian Robert Nicholl implied that the Srivijayans of Sumatra, Vijayans of Vijayapura at Brunei-Sarawak, and the Visayans in the Philippines were all related and connected to each other since they form one contiguous area.[9]: 37\n\nAccording to Augustinian Friar, Rev. Fr. Santaren, Datu Macatunao or Rajah Makatunao is the “sultan of the Moros,” and a relative of Datu Puti who seized the properties and riches of the ten datus. Robert Nicholls, a historian from Brunei identified Rajah Tugao, the leader of the Malano Kingdom of Sarawak, as the Rajah Makatunao referred to in the Maragtas. The Bornean warriors Labaodungon and Paybare, after learning of this injustice from their father-in-law Paiburong, sailed to Odtojan in Borneo where Makatunaw ruled. Using local soldiers recruited from the Philippines as well as fellow pioneers, the warriors sacked the city, killed Makatunaw and his family, retrieved the stolen properties of the 10 datus, enslaved the remaining population of Odtojan, and sailed back to Panay. Labaw Donggon and his wife, Ojaytanayon, later settled in a place called Moroboro. Afterwards there are descriptions of various towns founded by the datus in Panay, other Visayan islands, and southern Luzon.[12]\n\nChampa-Sulu War\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chams who migrated to Sulu were called Orang Dampuan.[13] [14] The Champa Civilization and the port-kingdom of Sulu engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu where they were known as Orang Dampuan from the 10th–13th centuries. The Orang Dampuan were slaughtered by envious native Sulu Buranuns due to the wealth of the Orang Dampuan.[15] The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory slaughter by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored.[16] The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa.[17] Sulu received civilization in its Indic form from the Orang Dampuan.[18]\n\nVisayan Raids against China\n\n[edit]\n\nAntecedent to these raids, sometime between A.D. 1174 and 1190, a traveling Chinese government bureaucrat Chau Ju-Kua reported that a certain group of \"ferocious raiders of China's Fukien coast\" which he called the \"Pi-sho-ye\", believed to have lived on the southern part of Formosa.[19]\n\nIn A.D. 1273, another work written by Ma Tuan Lin, which came to the knowledge of non-Chinese readers through a translation made by the Marquis D'Hervey de Saint-Denys, gave reference to the Pi-sho-ye raiders, thought to have originated from the southern portion of Formosa. However, the author observed that these raiders spoke a different language and had an entirely different appearance (presumably when compared to the inhabitants of Formosa). Some scholars have put forth the theory that the Pi-sho-ye were actually people from the Visayas islands.[19] Furthermore, Boholano oral legends say that people from the Kedatuan of Dapitan were the ones that lead the raids on China.[20]\n\nPon-i Invasion of Philippine Kingdoms\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 12th century, then-Hindu Brunei called \"Pon-i\", as reported in the Chinese annals Nanhai zhi, invaded Malilu 麻裏蘆 (present-day Manila) as it also administered Sarawak and Sabah, as well as the Philippine kingdoms Butuan, Sulu, Ma-i (Mindoro), Shahuchong 沙胡重 (present-day Siocon), Yachen 啞陳 (Oton), and 文杜陵 Wenduling (present-day Mindanao). Manila regained independence.[21]\n\nWar between Sulu and Majapahit\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the mid 14th century, the Majapahit empire mentioned in its manuscript Nagarakretagama Canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365, that the area of Solot (Sulu) was part of the empire.[22][23] Nagarakretagama was composed as a eulogy for their emperor Hayam Wuruk.[24] However, Chinese sources then report that in 1369, the Sulus regained independence and in vengeance, assaulted Majapahit and its province, Po-ni (Brunei) which Majapahit invaded, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from the Majapahit capital succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack and the Majapahit collaborating Pon-i royalty have to deal with the theft of two sacred pearls by Sulu. The Majapahit Empire, attempted to reconquer the kingdoms of Sulu and Manila but they were permanently repulsed. Furthermore, the Sulus counter-invaded deep into Majapahit held East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan[25]\n\nWar between the Moros and Cebu\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rajahnate of Cebu\n\nDuring the early 1400s, Rajamuda Sri Lumay, a Chola dynasty prince who rebelled against the Cholas and sided with his Malay subjects established an independent Tamil-Malay Indianized kingdom in Cebu called the Rajahnate of Cebu, he established his country by waging scorched earth tactics against raiders from Mindanao. War between the Muslims and Cebu lasted until the Spanish era.[26]\n\nBrunei's invasion of Tondo, incorporation of Sulu and establishment of Manila\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Battle of Manila (1500s) was fought in Manila between citizens of the Kingdom of Tondo led by their Lakan, Sukwu and the soldiers of the Sultanate of Brunei led by Sultan Bolkiah the singing captain. The aftermath of the battle was the formation of an alliance between the newly established Kingdom of Maynila (Selurong) and the Sultanate of Brunei, to crush the power of the Kingdom of Tondo and the subsequent installation of the Pro-Islamic Rajah Sulaiman into power. Furthermore, Sultan Bolkiah's victory over Sulu and Seludong (modern day Manila), as well as his marriages to Laila Mecanai the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul-Ombra (an uncle of Sharifa Mahandun married to Nakhoda Angging or Maharaja Anddin of Sulu), and to the daughter of Datu Kemin, widened Brunei's influence in the Philippines.[28]\n\nTerritorial conflict between Manila and Tondo\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the account of Rajah Matanda as recalled by Magellan expedition members Gines de Mafra, Rodrigo de Aganduru Moriz, and expedition scribe Antonio Pigafetta, Maynila had a territorial conflict with Tondo in the years before 1521.\n\nAt the time, Rajah Matanda's mother (whose name was not mentioned in the accounts) served as the paramount ruler of the Maynila polity, taking over from Rajah Matanda's father (also unnamed in the accounts), who had died when Rajah Matanda was still very young. Rajah Matanda, then simply known as the \"Young Prince\" Ache, was raised alongside his cousin, who was ruler of Tondo – presumed by some to be a young Bunao Lakandula, although not specifically named in the accounts.\n\nDuring this time, Ache realized that his cousin, who was ruler of the Tondo polity, was \"slyly\" taking advantage of Ache's mother by taking over territory belonging to Maynila. When Ache asked his mother for permission to address the matter, his mother refused, encouraging the young prince to keep his peace instead. Prince Ache could not accept this and thus left Maynila with some of his father's trusted men, to go to his \"grandfather\", the Sultan of Brunei, to ask for assistance. The Sultan responded by giving Ache a position as commander of his naval force.\n\nIn 1521, Prince Ache was coming fresh from a military victory at the helm of the Bruneian navy and was supposedly on his way back to Maynila with the intent of confronting his cousin when he came upon and attacked the remnants of the Magellan expedition, then under the command of Sebastian Elcano. Some historians[29] suggest that Ache's decision to attack must have been influenced by a desire to expand his fleet even further as he made his way back to Lusong and Maynila, where he could use the size of his fleet as leverage against his cousin, the ruler of Tondo.\n\nBattle of Mactan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Battle of Mactan\n\nThe Battle of Mactan on April 27, 1521, is celebrated as the earliest reported resistance [dubious – discuss] of the natives in the Philippines against western invaders.[according to whom?] Lapu-Lapu, a Chieftain of Mactan Island, defeated Christian European explorers led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan.[30][31]\n\nOn March 16, 1521, the island of Samar was sighted. The following morning, March 17, Magellan landed on the island of Homonhon.[32][33] He parleyed with Rajah Calambu of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu Island on April 7. With the aid of Magellan's Malay interpreter, Enrique, Rajah Humabon of Cebu and his subjects converted to Christianity and became allies. Suitably impressed by Spanish firearms and artillery, Rajah Humabon suggested that Magellan project power to cow Lapu-Lapu, who was being belligerent against his authority.\n\nMagellan deployed 49 armored men, less than half his crew, with crossbows and guns, but could not anchor near land because the island is surrounded by shallow coral bottoms and thus unsuitable for the Spanish galleons to get close to shore. His crew had to wade through the surf to make a landing and the ship was too far to support them with artillery. Antonio Pigafetta, a supernumerary on the voyage who later returned to Seville, Spain, records that Lapu-Lapu had at least 1500 warriors in the battle. During the battle, Magellan was wounded in the leg, while still in the surf. As the crew were fleeing to the boats, Pigafetta recorded that Magellan covered their retreat, turning at them on several occasions to make sure they were getting away, and was finally surrounded by a multitude of warriors and killed. The total toll was of eight crewmen killed on Magellan's side against an unknown number of casualties from the Mactan natives.\n\nThe Kedatuan of Dapitan vs the Ternate and Lanao Sultanates\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kedatuan of Dapitan\n\nBy 1563, before the full Spanish colonization agenda came to Bohol, the Kedatuan of Dapitan was at war with the Sultanate of Ternate, a Papuan speaking Muslim state in the Moluccas, which was also raiding the Rajahnate of Butuan. At the time, Dapitan was ruled by two brothers named Dalisan and Pagbuaya. The Ternateans at the time were allied to the Portuguese. Dapitan was destroyed by Ternateans and Datu Dalisan was killed in battle. His brother, Datu Pagbuaya, together with his people fled to Mindanao and established a new Dapitan in the northern coast of the Zamboanga peninsula and displaced its Muslim natives. In the process, waging war against the Sultanate of Lanao and conquering territories from the Sultanate.[34]\n\nLucoes Mercenary Activity\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lucoes\n\nDue to the conflict-ridden nature of the Philippine archipelago, warriors were forged in the many wars in the islands, thus the islands acquired a reputation for its capable mercenaries, which were soon employed all across South and Southeast Asia with some influence even manifested in East Asia at Japan where Lucoes sailors initially guided Portuguese ships to the Shogunate[35] and even South Asia in Sri Lanka where Lungshanoid pottery from Luzon were found in burials there.[36] Lucoes (warriors from Luzon) aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547 AD. At the same time, Lusung warriors fought alongside the Siamese king and faced the same elephant army of the Burmese king in the defense of the Siamese capital at Ayuthaya.[37] The former sultan of Malacca decided to retake his city from the Portuguese with a fleet of ships from Lusung in 1525 AD.[a]\n\nPinto noted that there were a number of them in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511.[39] Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521.[37] One famous Lucoes is Regimo de Raja, who was appointed by the Portuguese at Malacca as Temenggung (Jawi: تمڠݢوڠ[40]) or Supreme Governor and Chief General. The Lucoes were so commercially and militarily influential that the Portuguese soldier Joao de Barros considered them, \"the most warlike and valiant of these parts.\"[41] Yet among themselves the Lucoes were not united and the Portuguese soldier, Mendes Pinto noted that Muslim and Non-Muslim Lucoes rivaled each other.[39]\n\nSpanish colonial period (1565–1898)\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly Spanish Conquest\n\n[edit]\n\nBattle of Manila (1570)\n\nBattle of Bangkusay Channel\n\nSiege of Cainta (August 1571)\n\nMajor Revolts (1567–1872)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Philippine revolts against Spain\n\nDagami Revolt (1567)\n\nTagalog Revolt (1574)\n\nPampanga Revolt (1585)\n\nTondo Conspiracy (1587)\n\nDingras Revolt (1589)\n\nCagayan Revolt (1589)\n\nMagalat Revolt (1596)\n\nIgorot Revolt (1601)\n\nSangley Revolt (1603)\n\nCaquenga Revolt (1607)\n\nIrraya or Gaddang Revolt (1621)\n\nTamblot Revolt (1621–1622)\n\nBankaw revolt (1621–1622)\n\nItneg Revolt (1625–1627)\n\nLadia Revolt (1643)\n\nSumuroy Revolt (1649–1650)\n\nManiago Revolt (1660–1661)\n\nMalong Revolt (1660–1661)\n\nAlmazan Revolt (January 1661)\n\nChinese Revolt (1662)\n\nPanay Revolt (1663)\n\nZambal Revolt (1681–1683)\n\nDagohoy Rebellion (1744–1829)\n\nAgrarian Revolt (1745)\n\nSilang Revolt (1762–1763)\n\nPalaris Revolt (1762–1765)\n\nBasi Revolt (1807)\n\nNovales Revolt (1823)\n\nPalmero Conspiracy (1828)\n\nPule Revolt (1840–1841)\n\nCavite Mutiny (1872)\n\nMoro campaign (1569–1898)\n\n[edit]\n\nBattle of Cebu (1569)\n\nSpanish-Moro Incident (1570)\n\nJolo Jihad (1578–1580)\n\nCotabato Revolt (1597)\n\nSpanish-Moro Incident (1602)\n\nBasilan Revolt (1614)\n\nKudarat Revolt (1625)\n\nBattle of Jolo (1628)\n\nSulu Revolt (1628)\n\nLanao Lamitan Revolt (1637)\n\nBattle of Punta Flechas (1638)\n\nSultan Bungsu Revolt (1638)\n\nMindanao Revolt (1638)\n\nLanao Revolt (1639)\n\nSultan Salibansa Revolt (1639)\n\nCorralat Revolt (1649)\n\nSpanish-Moro Incident (1876)\n\nLimahong campaign (1574–1576)\n\nMain article: Limahong\n\nBattle of Manila (1574)\n\nCastilian War (1578)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Castilian War\n\nCagayan battles (1582)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1582 Cagayan battles\n\nThe 1582 Cagayan battles were a series of clashes between the forces of Colonial Philippines led by Captain Juan Pablo de Carrión and wokou (possibly led by Japanese pirates) headed by Tay Fusa.

At the peak of the revolution, some Filipinos and a few Spaniards in the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Navy defected to the Philippine Revolutionary Army. The Katipunan, led by the founder Andres Bonifacio and patriots, was a secessionist movement and shadow government spread throughout much of the islands, and began to influence much of the Philippines taking full advantage of Spanish failures against Cuban nationalists, whose goal was independence advocating independence through armed revolt against Spain through a revolution. During a mass gathering in the city of Caloocan, the members of the Katipunan organized themselves into a revolutionary government, named the newly established government \"Haring Bayang Katagalugan\", and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution. On August 24, Bonifacio called for a simultaneous coordinated attack and the surrounding towns on the capital Manila. Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces in Manila. This attack has failed, however, the surrounding provinces began to revolt. In particular, rebels in Cavite led by led by Mariano Álvarez and Baldomero Aguinaldo (who were leaders from two different factions of the Katipunan) won major early victories. A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to a schism among Katipunan leadership followed by Bonifacio's execution in 1897, with command shifting to Aguinaldo who led his own newly formed of the revolutionary government.

Entering the Philippine theater on May 1, 1898, the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey aboard the USS Olympia defeated Spanish squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo in a matter of hoursm effectively seizing control of Manila. Dewey's force sustained only a single casualty, a heart attack aboard one of his vessels, and only nine wounded. On May 19, after the battle, Dewey had Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo, who had been in exile in Hong Kong transported to Manila. After assuming command of Filipino forces on May 24, Aguinaldo reignited the Philippine Revolution begun in 1896 and initiated land campaigns against the Spanish colonial government. By June 9, Aguinaldo's forces gained control of the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bataan, Zambales, Pampanga, Pangasinan, and Mindoro, and had laid siege to the Spanish capital in Manila.\n\nOn 12 June, 1898, Aguinaldo's forces declared the independence of the Philippines. The Declaration was signed by ninety-eight persons, among them an American army officer who witnessed the proclamation. Although this signified the end date of the revolution, neither Spain nor the United States recognized Philippine independence. On August 13, after the 1898 Battle of Manila the Spanish commander, Captain-General Fermin Jaudenes, surrendered the capital to U.S. forces. This battle marked the end of Filipino–American collaboration, as the American action of preventing Filipino forces from entering the captured city of Manila was deeply resented by the Filipinos. The U.S. established a military government in the Philippines and the insurgent First Philippine Republic was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 23, 1899. The Spanish rule of the Philippines officially ended with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which also ended the Spanish-American War. In that treaty, the U.S. agreed to pay US$20 million to the Spanish colonial government and the Spanish government ceded the Philippine Archipelago and other territories to the United States. This put the independence of the newly declared Southeast Asian republic in grave danger and, angered by the betrayal, Filipinos later declared war..\n\nAmerican colonial period (1899–1941) and Japanese occupation (1942–1945)\n\n[edit]\n\nPhilippine–American War (1899–1913)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Philippine–American War\n\nThe Philippine–American War[b] was a conflict between the United States and the First Philippine Republic from 1899 through at least 1902, when the Filipino leadership generally accepted American rule.
