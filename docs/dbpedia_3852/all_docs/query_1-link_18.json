        "text": "Suggested Teaching Instructions\n\nThis activity can be used during a unit on the Cold War when covering the concept of containment and the Korean War. For grades 7-12. Approximate time needed is 25-30 minutes.\n\nDirect students to begin the document-analysis activity individually or in pairs. They will learn that the document is a statement by the President about an important military matter, but will need to answer the questions to figure out which President (Truman) and what the military matter is (sending forces to Korea at the beginning of the Korean War).\n\nStudents should spend a minute or two looking at the document unassisted. Then they should proceed to answer the questions that follow, which will guide them through the process of document analysis:\n\nMeet the document.\n\nObserve its parts.\n\nTry to make sense of it.\n\nUse it as historical evidence.\n\nIf necessary, check in with your students at each step in the process and model analysis as needed.\n\nOnce students have finished the questions, discuss their answers as a class. They should gather that there was a conflict in Korea and that the President – President Harry Truman – told the American people that he was sending troops to fight against the North Koreans. If students have trouble with the following questions, discuss them specifically:\n\nWhat was happening at the time in history this document was created? — During the Cold War, the US government feared communism would spread around the world and adopted a policy of \"containment.\"\n\nWhat did the President mean by \"subversion\" when he said \"Communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations\"? — The United States had been worried about communists infiltrating the US government.\n\nThe President mentions North Korea and China, but what other country do you think he was referring to without naming when he talked about \"Communism\"? — the Soviet Union\n\nWhat other places does the President mention? Why? — Truman pledged to defend Formosa (Taiwan) from attack by Communist China, to strengthen US forces in the Philippines, and to support French forces in Indochina – a conflict that would eventually escalate into the Vietnam War. These plans demonstrate the US policy of containment of communism."
