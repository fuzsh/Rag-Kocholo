        "text": "The Philippines upholds a strong humanitarian tradition of providing succor for forcibly displaced individuals in need of protection. Long before the Philippines had formal immigration policies and became a State party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Filipinos have embodied the spirit of compassion, solidarity, and humanity. This nation was among the first to spontaneously offer asylum to successive waves of refugees fleeing persecution since the end of World War I.\n\n>> Read more about the 9 Waves of Refugees\n\nPaying Tribute\n\nOn January 27th 2020, in observance of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, twin events were organized by the Philippine Mission to the United Nations in New York and the Philippine Embassy in Israel at the United Nations headquarters in New York and Balai Quezon in Tel-Aviv, respectively. “Safe Haven: Jewish Refugees in the Philippines” featured the viewing of “The Last Manila-ners”, “Quezon’s Game”, and “An Open Door: Jewish Rescue in the Philippines”, as well as personal testimonies from Holocaust survivors who found refuge in the Philippines.\n\n>> Read full article in DFA website: New York, Tel-Aviv Remember Quezon’s Open Door Policy\n\nIn 1934, under the admittance of President Manuel L. Quezon and U.S. High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, Jewish refugees escaping Nazi persecution were able to find sanctuary in the Philippines before Filipinos and Jews alike experienced the brunt of the Second World War. President Quezon pushed back against critics of his open-door immigration policy by issuing Proclamation No. 173 on August 21, 1937. He called on all Filipinos to welcome the refugees and instructed the government to assist them. This later became the basis of President Quezon’s issuance of Commonwealth Act 613, later the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940.\n\nForeign Affairs Secretary Teodoro L. Locsin Jr., in his keynote address delivered in New York, highlighted the importance of this legacy. He said, “In this time of rising anti-Semitism, this story of my country’s Open Doors Policy shows how plain decency can triumph over raging prejudice — which seems so irresistible when all we have to counter it is the soft quality of caring. It is a great moral victory that recognizes every life saved as immeasurably valuable for containing the infinite possibilities of a single human life.”\n\nAmong the personal testimonies heard during the event were those of Holocaust survivors Ralph Preiss and Max Weissler. They are “Manila-ners” – 1,300 European Jews who fled to Manila and have come to consider the Philippines their second home. “The Last Manila-ners,” one of the documentary films shown in the event, shows the personal accounts and stories of the last living Jewish refugees who sought refuge in Manila.\n\n>> Watch the trailer of “The Last Manila-ners”\n\nAn Unwavering Commitment\n\nThe Philippines’ history of providing asylum and protection to the forcibly displaced goes beyond the Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust. The succor extended to Spanish republicans fleeing the end of the Spanish Civil war, Vietnamese “boat people” fleeing the Vietnam War, and many others.\n\nThe Government of the Philippines continues to uphold this humanitarian tradition through its commitment to the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and its participation in the first Global Refugee Forum, held on 17-18 December in Palais Des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. During this high-level meeting among 3,000 attendees, the Philippines joined other states and stakeholders in pledging commitments of support for refugees and the communities they live in.\n\nThe statement of the Republic of the Philippines was read by Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) Legal Staff, Refugees and Stateless Persons Protection Unit Officer-in-Charge Chief State Counsel Ruben F. Fondevilla, and mentions the Philippines’ “unwavering commitment to attain a world that respects the rights of every individual with or without a country because we are all citizens of humanity”.\n\n>> Read the full statement"
