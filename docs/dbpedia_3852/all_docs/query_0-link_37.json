        "text": "Americans have fought in many wars, within their own country as well as abroad. These wars were fought for a variety of reasons, ranging from the need to be independent from colonists to the expansion of national boundaries.\n\nHere’s a list of some of the American wars that took place since the United States became an independent nation. Please note: this is not a full list of every war or conflict that American soldiers were a part of.\n\nList of Major American Wars\n\nThe Revolutionary War (1775-1783)\n\nThe British Navigation acts, the closing of western lands, the restricting of the colonial currency, the Quartering Act, the Stamp Act, and The Townshend Acts enacted by the British Parliament contributed to the revolution of colonists. In 1773, the British Parliament permitted the East India Company to sell tea in the colonies at very low prices, which resulted in the Boston tea party. The response of the British Parliament was the Intolerable Acts and the Quebec Act in 1774. In September of the same year, the First Continental Congress was held in Philadelphia. The Revolutionary War began in 1775. The second Continental Congress was held in May, 1775 in Philadelphia. In 1776, the United States declared independence. British and American troops fought near Boston, New York, Trenton, and other places. In 1783, by the Treaty of Paris, the independence of the 13th colonies was recognized by Great Britain, and the war ended.\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 3,500,000\n\nService Members: 200,000\n\nRatio: 5.7%\n\nCasualties: 4,435 Dead, 6,188 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $1.2\n\nFlags of the Era:\n\nDon’t Tread On Me!\n\nThere are many renditions of this concept and don’t worry - we have them all. This slogan inspired a very famous political cartoon that was published in the Pennsylvania Journal in 1754, which featured a snake cut into pieces with the caption \"Join or Die.\" This snake acted as a symbol of resistance at the time, and it was often used in political propaganda.\n\nDon’t underestimate the American colonists and don't underestimate how great these flags will look on your house!\n\nThe Original Betsy Ross Flag\n\nPerhaps one of the most iconic flags in American History, Betsy Ross knew what she was doing when she made this work of art. She was called upon by none other than George Washington himself, who was head of the continental army at the time. Along with some other members of the secret continental congress, he asked her to make something that could unite the people under a new ideal. And she delivered this masterpiece that set the US up on the path to harmony with each other and future freedom!\n\nWar of 1812 (1812-1815)\n\nThe United States declared war on Britain in 1812. The Americans’ attempts to conquer Canada during the campaigns of 1812-1813 failed. British blockaded the American coast. After many battles, the war was ended in 1814 by the Treaty of Ghent, which was the Belgium of old. Weeks after that, Major General Andrew Jackson, also known as “Old Hickory,” won the battle of New Orleans. The war ended with no gain for both sides.\n\nWar of 1812 Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 7,600,000\n\nService Members: 286,000\n\nRatio: 3.8%\n\nCasualties: 2,260 Dead, 4,505 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $0.7\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nDon’t Give Up This Ship!\n\nIn the War of 1812, there were many notable battles. Among the most notable was the Battle of Lake Erie, not too far from our headquarters in East Greenbush New York. In this battle, Captain James Lawrence uttered his final words that are famous today, “Don't give up this ship!” Today, his bravery is celebrated and commemorated in the Don't Give Up This Ship flag.\n\nMexican - American War (1846-1848)\n\nMexico refused to recognize the annexation of Texas. In 1846, Mexicans attacked US troops, and the Congress declared war on Mexico. The Mexican-American War was ended by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. Mexico ceded the states of California, Utah, Nevada, as well as parts of New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Wyoming.\n\nMexican-American War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 21,100,000\n\nService Members: 78,718\n\nRatio: 0.4%\n\nCasualties: 13,283 Dead, 4,152 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $1.1\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nNew US State Flags\n\nAfter the Mexican American war, the US had a few extra states mentioned above! With all those states came new state flags for California, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Wyoming. That’s a lot of state flags and territory to explore. And the best news is that they are all available here at Gettysburg Flag Works.\n\nMexico Flag\n\nAdditionally, Mexico has a tremendous flag that pulls from its long history to give us what it is today. It touches on its Aztec heritage and the snake along with the eagle has a religious background that is strong symbolism for the idea of good triumphing over evil!\n\nAmerican Civil War (1861–1865)\n\nThe American Civil War was fought by 11 southern states known as the Confederacy and Union states. Since President Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party were against the expansion of slavery, the southern states declared their secession from the Union. This war was the deadliest in American history. The Union won, the Confederate armies surrendered in 1865, and the war ended the practice of slavery.\n\nAmerican Civil War Statistics:\n\nThe Union\n\nPopulation: 26,200,000\n\nService Members: 2,803,300\n\nRatio: 10.7%\n\nCasualties: 360,000 Dead, 275,175 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $27.3\n\nThe Confederate States of America\n\nPopulation: 8,100,000\n\nService Members: 1,064,200\n\nRatio: 13.1%\n\nCasualties: 260,000 Dead, 137,000+ Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $17.1\n\nTotal\n\nPopulation: 34,300,000\n\nService Members: 3,867,500\n\nRatio: 11.1%\n\nCasualties: 620,000 Dead, 412,175+ Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $44.4\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\n34 Star Union Civil War Flag\n\nDuring the Civil War, the US didn't have all 50 states that are present today. In fact they only had 34 states. That is why we specifically made the 34-star Union Civil Flag. The Union soldiers and leadership specifically left the southern states represented on the flag because they refused to let them secede from the union.\n\nBonnie Blue Flag\n\nThe Bonnie Blue Flag was another prominent flag at the time as it represented the Confederate States of America at the beginning of the war, before switching over to the confederate flag we know today. Its simple design is known to be the first lone-star flag made in America.\n\nSpanish-American War (1898)\n\nSpain declared war on the US in April 1898 because the US supported the Cuban struggle for independence. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in August, 1898. The US gained the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam.\n\nSpanish-American War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 74,600,000\n\nService Members: 306,800\n\nRatio: 0.4%\n\nCasualties: 387 Dead, 1,662 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $6.3\n\nWorld War I (1914-1918)\n\nThe First World War began in 1914, and it was fought between the Allied (Entente) Powers, which included the Russian Empire, the British Empire, France, the Empire of Japan, Italy, and the US, and the Central Powers, which included the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The war ended with the victory of the Allied Powers in 1918. New nations were formed.\n\nWorld War I Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 102,800,000\n\nService Members: 4,743,800\n\nRatio: 4.6%\n\nCasualties: 116,708 Dead, 204,002 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $196.5\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nWWI Commemorative Flag\n\nWe love honoring and remembering the hard fought battles and sacrifices made during the war. That is why we offer this WW! Commemorative Flag, as it was known at the time as the war to end all wars. It represents the First World War and sports the tag line,”Lest We Forget.”\n\nWorld War II (1939-1945)\n\nThe Second World War started in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. It was fought between the Axis Powers, which consisted of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Allies, which were made up of the British Empire, the USSR, and the USA. The war ended with the capitulation of Germany and Japan in 1945. Warsaw Pact and NATO were created, and the Cold War began.\n\nWorld War II Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 135,500,000\n\nService Members: 16,353,700\n\nRatio: 12.2%\n\nCasualties: 407,316 Dead, 670,846 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $2,091.3\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nAmerican 48 Star Flag\n\nJust like in the first world war, Alaska and Hawaii hadn’t joined the US as states. Therefore we still love our 48 star flag to represent the time!\n\nWWII Commemorative Flag\n\nOn top of the 48 star flag, we have a beautifully done commemorative flag that is made for the “Greatest Generation.” These brave men and women deserve this tribute for their sacrifice during this difficult time!\n\nKorean War (1950-1953)\n\nIn 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, and the nations that were allied with the US (the UN) intervened on behalf of the South. The USSR and the People’s Republic of China supported the North Korea. The Korean conflict ended in 1953. The Korean Demilitarized Zone was established.\n\nKorean War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 151,700,000\n\nService Members: 5,764,100\n\nRatio: 3.8%\n\nCasualties: 33,651 Dead, 103,284 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $263.9\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nKorean War Commemorative Flag\n\nThose who fought in this war are represented by the Korean War Commemorative Flag. There aren’t any other American flags that are especially relevant to the era. Even though there aren’t a significant amount of flags to represent the war, we have a myriad of lapel pins, grave markers and beautiful medallions to offer!\n\nVietnam War (1959-1975)\n\nThe Vietnam War was fought between the communist forces of North Vietnam, Viet Kong, Khmer Rouge, the People’s Republic of China, USSR, North Korea, and Pathet Lao, and the anticommunist forces of US, South Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Laos and the Khmer Republic. North Vietnam won, and Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam became communist states.\n\nVietnam War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 204,900,000\n\nService Members: 8,744,000\n\nRatio: 4.3%\n\nCasualties: 58,168 Dead, 303,635 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $346.7\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nThe Vietnam War Veterans Commemorative Flag\n\nThe Vietnam War was controversial - what isn’t controversial is how well these flags represent this valiant group of soldiers who fought for America in one of the most difficult conflicts we have entered.\n\nOur best Vietnam War flags display the colors of the Vietnam war. The red represents the three Vietnamese empires of Tonkin, Annam and Cochin China. The green demonstrates the dense jungles of Vietnam and terrain that the soldiers had to traverse throughout the war. Finally, the Yellow is showing the imperial color of Vietnam.\n\nGulf War (1990-1991)\n\nThe war was fought between Iraq and the coalition forces of 34 nations that were authorized by the UN, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The war ended with the coalition victory, and Kuwait was liberated.\n\nGulf War Statistics:\n\nPopulation: 260,000,000\n\nService Members: 2,750,000\n\nRatio: 1.1%\n\nCasualties: 382 Dead, 467 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost in billions (1990s): $61.1\n\nWar in Afghanistan (2001-2021)\n\nBeginning October 7, 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom is the U.S. led effort to drive al-Qaeda and Taliban forces from power in Afghanistan.\n\nAfghanistan War Statistics (as of 9/2021)\n\nU.S. Troops: 980,000\n\nU.S. Casualties: 2,455 dead\n\nFinancial Cost: $2 Trillion\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nWar in Afghanistan Veteran Grave Marker\n\nModern wars don’t really get creative with flags. Instead, we have a wonderful tribute in the form of a grave marker for those who fell during the war fighting for our freedom.\n\nIraq War (2003-2011)\n\nOperation Iraqi Freedom (renamed Operation New Dawn in September 2010) began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for nearly a decade, as insurgent fighters resisted the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraq government. In 2007, following a decline in insurgent violence, the U.S. gradually began to reduce its military presence, and the last U.S. troops exited on December 15, 2011, marking the end of the war.\n\nIraq War Statistics:\n\nIraq Population: 25 Million (2003)\n\nU.S. Troops: 1 Million+\n\nU.S. Military Casualties: 4,488 Dead, 32,223 Wounded\n\nFinancial Cost: $1.7 trillion (through Fiscal Year 2013)\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nMilitary, Armed Forces & POW/MIA Flags\n\nSimilar to the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq war doesn’t have commemorative flags or historical flags to represent it well. This is most likely due to how recent the war was. Instead please tribute those fallen with Iraq War grave markers and/or appropriate military, armed forces and POW/MIA flags.\n\nMore 21st Century Interventions (2000-Present)\n\nMany wars have been waged on terror and the groups that make up terror groups. Some of these groups include but are not limited to al-Qaeda, Islamic State, ISIS, al-shabaab and various other groups. In these conflicts, the U.S.A. supported and fought to defend freedom to varying degrees. These conflicts are not large enough to be considered a full fledged war for the U.S., but still deserve recognition nonetheless.\n\nThe following interventions and operations are covered in this section:\n\nAmerican Intervention in Yemen (2002-Present)\n\nAmerican Intervention In The War In North-West Pakistan (2004-2018)\n\nSecond U.S. Intervention in the Somali Civil War (2007–present)\n\nOperation Ocean Shield (2009-2016)\n\nInternational Intervention in Libya (2011) (2015–2019)\n\nOperation Observant Compass in Uganda (2011–2017)\n\nAmerican-led Intervention in Syria (2014–present)\n\nAmerican Military Intervention in Niger (2018–present)\n\nFlags Of The Era:\n\nCountry Flags & Battle Tough American Flags\n\nWhile we do not support terror groups, you can show your support for the countries that have been affected by all of these conflicts including the flags, stick flags and lapel pins for the countries of Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, Uganda, Syria, and Niger! And as always, our beautiful Battle Tough American Flags fly with all of our allied countries as the U.S. works to defend pride, liberty and honor everywhere in the world.\n\nAmerican Intervention in Yemen (2002-Present)\n\nThis refers to the United States' involvement in Yemen's ongoing civil war, which began in 2002 as part of the larger War on Terror. The conflict in Yemen has its roots in political and economic grievances, including corruption, unemployment, and poverty, which led to protests and demands for political reform in 2011. This was followed by a power struggle between different factions, including the internationally recognized government and the Houthi rebel movement, which escalated into a full-blown civil war in 2014. The U.S. has provided military support to the Yemeni government as its broader counterterrorism efforts in the region.\n\nIntervention in Yemen Statistics\n\nPopulation: Approximately 29.8 million (2021 estimate)\n\nUS Troops Sent Over: Unknown (US military presence is limited, but has included drone strikes, training and advising Yemeni forces, and special operations forces) US Military Casualties: At least 1 US service member killed in action (since 2017)\n\nFinancial Cost to the US: Unknown\n\nAmerican Intervention In The War In North-West Pakistan (2004-2018):\n\nThe conflict in Pakistan's northwest region has its roots in the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s, when the U.S. and other countries provided support to Afghan militants fighting against Soviet forces.
