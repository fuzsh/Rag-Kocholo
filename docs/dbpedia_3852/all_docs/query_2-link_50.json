        "text": "Unfortunately, the comfort women system did not cease to exist when Korea won independence from imperial Japan after World War II. Rather, the system evolved into a new form for American soldiers.\n\nFor the Sake of National Security\n\nSoon after gaining independence, the Korean War (1950-1953) broke out.6 The war was theologically justified by Christian realists such as Reinhold Niebuhr because the United States felt responsible for protecting democracy in the Far East against evil communist North Korea, allegedly controlled by China and the former Soviet Union.7\n\nThe real tragedy of the Korean War is not simply that the war resolved nothing, but that the country has been divided ever since, guaranteeing consistent, extreme tension between the North and South for six decades now. One of the legacies of the war was the practice of U.S. military prostitution, the use of Korean sex workers who became America’s “comfort women.”8\n\nThroughout the Korean and Vietnam wars, the so-called Relaxation and Recreation business had been systematized around the U.S. military camps in South Korea. More than a million Korean women have sexually catered to U.S. soldiers for economic gain.9 Researching U.S. military prostitution in South Korea, I learned that a significant number of Korean women entered the U.S. military sex industry in order to support their families and that these women were under governmental surveillance. Even today, camp towns around U.S. military bases import women from Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. U.S. military sex workers’ voices, in spite of their consistent experience of sexual assault, rape, physical abuse, and exploitation, have been silenced, both by the Korean government and U.S. forces in Korea, for the sake of national security.\n\nThe modern “comfort woman” system is no longer a unique issue in Korea or the root story only of Korean women, because gender-based wartime\n\nsexual violence has become so common in various conflict zones. For instance, the International Red Cross’s study of post-conflict African countries found that in nations such as Rwanda, Sierra Leon, Congo, and Nigeria, survivors of rape or sexual violence are accused of adultery and prostitution.10 In the Rwandan genocide, the survivors of rape bore an estimated three thousand to five thousand children. These children, called the “unwanted children” or “children of bad memories,” have faced rejection from their society just as many bi-racial children of American soldiers and Korean sex workers have been ostracized in South Korea.11\n\nUncontrollable Drives\n\nCynthia Enloe, a feminist scholar of international relations, argues that “in our society there is a wide- spread belief that soldiers’ sexuality is determined by uncontrollable ‘drives.’ ”12 While sounding tough and manly regarding military matters, politicians secretly seek safe commercialized sex for soldiers with “uncontrollable” sexual drives in order to avoid the diplomatic issue of military rape in foreign countries. These politicians share a patriarchal assumption that sexual entertainment of soldiers is essential to maintaining military morale.13\n\nSuch cultural habits and prejudices are difficult to break. Because of its widespread practice, wartime sexual violence is habitually considered an unavoidable byproduct of armed conflict. Only recently has wartime rape been redefined as a crime under the Geneva Conventions – and only after an estimated two thousand to five thousand Bosnian Muslim women were systematically raped by Serbian soldiers.14\n\nHow can a Christian feminist analysis of military sexual violence such as the comfort women system change the discourse and practices of war and peacemaking? Here I present two suggestions.\n\nFirst, women’s experience of wartime sexual violence must be examined in a theological framework. Instead of accepting wartime violence against women as a normal activity of modern warfare, we should insist that these horrific practices be judged by universal values of human dignity, integrity, and sacredness found at the center of God’s creation. Women’s perspectives on peace, an outgrowth of their particular experiences of war and militarism, must be included in Christian discourse on peacemaking.\n\nSecond, since women are the victims of armed conflicts across the globe, we should listen to women who are affected by war and wartime prejudice.\n\nOur churches and institutions should be intentional and systematic about hearing women’s witness to gender-based wartime violence – their experiences of military prostitution, rape, sexual slavery, and forced pregnancy.\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ The Impact of Violent Conflict on Women and Girls (2002), where cultures of violence and discrimination against women and girls exist prior to conflict, they are exacerbated during conflict. A lack of women’s voices in theological discussion and peacemaking has dire effects on women. This may reflect women’s status in the Christian community, and the church’s lack of commitment to protecting women’s human rights. Truly without gender equality within our faith community, gender-based sexual violence during wartime will continue. Grounded in steadfast faith in God’s peace and love, may we Christians liberate ourselves from gender inequality, violent conflict, hatred, and fear.\n\nK.
