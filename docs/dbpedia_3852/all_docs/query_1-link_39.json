        "text": "When Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos dedicated the Pacific War Memorial (Figure 1) on 22 June 1968, he described it as a “monument to the American and Filipino alliance for freedom.”Footnote 1 The structure, which stands on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay, was particularly significant for an American overseas memorial, as it was built to commemorate the Philippine as well as the American forces that had lost their lives in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War. Yet Marcos's depiction of a partnership belies the anomaly that is the memorial's construction by the United States on a former colony, twenty-two years after it had gained independence. While the United States has built many overseas memorials to commemorate its armed forces,Footnote 2 the Pacific War Memorial stands alone both in its location and its character as “much broader than a ‘Battle Monument’ … It is a symbol to be erected by the people of the United States and given to the people of the Philippines.”Footnote 3 Rather than simply commemorating American achievements in battle, it memorializes a relationship and an imperial legacy that the United States was unwilling to relinquish in the early decades of the Cold War.\n\nAlthough there has been some mention of the Pacific War Memorial in scholarship on Second World War memorialization, there has been no study of its meaning or of the impetus behind its creation.Footnote 4 Additionally, while several studies have examined the role of Second World War memorialization and its use in Southeast Asian national and regional identity building,Footnote 5 there has been little discussion of the role that United States overseas commemoration has played in this, and to what extent these transnational memorials shape – and are shaped by – the host country's existing and wider remembrances. The aim of this article is to explore the creation of the Pacific War Memorial and the degree to which the United States sought to shape its colonial legacy long after it recognized Philippine independence. Jenny Woodley and Christopher J. Young, in this journal, have noted the tensions that occur within memory construction in other contexts.Footnote 6 Similarly, the Pacific War Memorial and the Corregidor “memoryscape”Footnote 7 were shaped by a multitude of sometimes competing “commemorative agents.”Footnote 8\n\nThe Pacific War Memorial's location, Corregidor, marks the last place at which the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) surrendered the Philippines to the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War. Following the aerial bombardment of Manila on 8 December 1941, the USAFFE, led by General Douglas MacArthur, had withdrawn to the island, as well as to the Bataan peninsula. The forces on Bataan eventually surrendered on 9 April 1942 but those on Corregidor perservered until a month later on 6 May. Corregidor was also a significant site in the recapturing of the Philippines from the Japanese, and was reclaimed by the returning USAFFE in February 1945. The Japanese occupation ended on 5 July 1945 and the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation by the United States on 4 July 1946.\n\nEven whilst exiled to the United States during the war, the Philippine government commemorated the anniversaries of the falls of Bataan and Corregidor. Indeed the names of both locations became synonymous with strength and courage. When paying tribute to a fallen soldier in 1943, Philippine President Quezon declared, “his was unflinching courage, his was loyalty unto death, his story is written in blood, in the forests and hills of Bataan and the rock that is Corregidor.”Footnote 9 Similarly, on his return to the Philippines in 1944 General MacArthur announced, “rally to me. Let the indomitable spirit of Bataan and Corregidor lead on.”Footnote 10 Through this shared symbolic rhetoric, Bataan and Corregidor came to represent an alliance between the United States and the Philippines and were regularly referred to as such. During the 1946 Philippine Independence Day proceedings, American Senator Millard Tydings stated, “Though our governments may sever the political ties which for half a century have bound us together, our governments can never alter or repeal the history of Bataan and Corregidor.”Footnote 11\n\nHowever, although remembrance served to reinforce the relationship between the two countries, it was also deployed as part of a Philippine nation-building agenda. In 1945, while pushing for immediate independence from the United States, President Osmeña commemorated National Heroes Day at a former Japanese internment camp, asserting that, “like Bataan, Capas also stands for Filipino courage.”Footnote 12 The use of National Heroes Day to remember the Second World War dead places the dead within the Philippine national narrative and elevates them to the status of Philippine revolutionary heroes such as José Rizal and Andres Bonifacio, whose personages were also honoured on this day. National commemoration of Rizal had been legislated under American colonial rule in 1902, with a monument erected in Manila's Luneta Park in 1913.Footnote 13 However, remembrance of Rizal was not simply a colonial institution. The earliest account of Rizal's memorialization was a service that took place in Paco Cemetery, Manila, on 1 November 1898.Footnote 14 Furthermore, Rizal's remembrance had been frequently used as a platform to call for Philippine independence in the early years of United States colonial rule.Footnote 15 Thus, although a culture of shared remembrance between the Philippines and the United States existed, memorialization also served a nationalist purpose.\n\nVeterans’ groups were also involved in memorialization. In 1952 the Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor was formed by Philippine veterans who, like the government, aimed to promote “justice, peace and democracy.”Footnote 16 Yet veterans also had personal motivations to “keep alive the memories of our military service together; to help one another and those whom our deceased brothers-in-arms left behind.”Footnote 17 This manifested itself in their petition to have the anniversary of Bataan's surrender recognized as a national day of commemoration, to which President Quirino agreed in 1952. The veterans’ demand for official recognition of their significant role in the conflict also took place in the aftermath of the 1946 Rescission Act. This Act decreed that Filipinos who had served the United States in the Philippine Army, or as approved guerrillas, were not recognized as having been in active service, thus preventing them from receiving any benefit payments.Footnote 18 Similarly, American veteran groups lobbied the Philippine government to distinguish the anniversary of the victory at Bessang Pass as a national holiday.Footnote 19 Following the institutionalization of Bataan Day, Second World War remembrance became focussed on this date. Indeed, the significance of Bataan as a memorial site to the government was evident immediately following the end of the war when President Osmeña set aside land for a Bataan National Park as part of the official commemorations in 1945.Footnote 20 Ricardo Jose has argued that the Philippine focus on Bataan was due to the large numbers of Filipinos who had fought there, whereas on Corregidor the majority of soldiers had been American.Footnote 21 Thus, before the American government announced its proposal to develop the Pacific War Memorial in 1953, the Philippine Second World War memorial landscape had been shaped significantly, with a notable emphasis on Bataan, indicating a shift from the shared memory of Corregidor. Indeed, although the anniversary of Corregidor's fall was also marked, official remembrances of this event eventually became subsumed within the Bataan Day rites.\n\nIn 1953 the United States Congress created the Corregidor–Bataan Memorial Commission (Corregidor Commission), to commence a “study for the survey, location and erection on Corregidor Island of a replica of the Statue of Liberty and the use of Corregidor Island as a memorial to the Philippine and American soldiers, sailors, and marines who lost their lives while serving in the Philippines during World War II.”Footnote 22 The memorial was initiated by former American ambassador to the Philippines Emmet O'Neal, who also served as chairman of the commission. Altogether the Corregidor Commission comprised nine members, including three Senators, three Congressmen, and three citizens: a former marine, a journalist who had been stationed on Corregidor, and O'Neal himself. Although there was no stipulation as to the commission's political composition, seven of its members were Democrats. Yet following the inauguration of President Eisenhower on 20 January 1953 and the Republican majority achieved in the Senate and House of Representatives in the years that followed, the Corregidor Commission's political makeup shifted.Footnote 23 Nevertheless, its agenda remained the same, since the vision for what would become the Pacific War Memorial was very much O'Neal's from the beginning.\n\nThe Pacific War Memorial was designed by Seattle-based architectural firm Naramore, Bain, Brady, and Johanson, and comprises a square courtyard, at the centre of which stands a domed room, ringed with reflecting pools. The room is open on all sides and supported by wide rectangular columns. At the centre of the room is a circular altar, above which the sky can be viewed through a rounded opening in the dome. On the other side of the courtyard is a long walkway, walled in by marble tablets listing each of the major battles of the Pacific conflict. Reflecting pools sit on either side of the walkway and the centre contains a rectangular concrete planter, within which local foliage has been planted. The walkway terminates in steps leading up to a raised platform that looks out onto Manila Bay. A bronze sculpture in the shape of a flame sits on the platform. Designed by the Greek American sculptor Aristides Demetrios, it is entitled the Eternal Flame of Freedom.\n\nUsing archival sources from the United States and the Philippines relating to the planning and construction of the Pacific War Memorial, as well as a visual interpretation of the monument itself conducted on two site visits, this article explores the tensions between colonial and decolonized remembrance within the site and the wider Corregidor memoryscape. The research for this article was undertaken at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library. Additional sources were obtained at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. Further research was completed at the American Historical Collection at Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines. In addition, I conducted interviews with Artemio Matibag, the director of the Corregidor Foundation, which manages Corregidor, and with Robert Hudson, the son of an American Second World War veteran, who is involved in the memorialization of the Bataan death march.\n\nThe article is divided into three parts. The first discusses the formation of the Corregidor–Bataan Memorial Commission and the significant role of its chairman, Emmet O'Neal, in shaping the development and construction of the memorial. The second analyses the aesthetics of the Pacific War Memorial itself. And the third considers its relationship to the wider memoryscape of Corregidor."
