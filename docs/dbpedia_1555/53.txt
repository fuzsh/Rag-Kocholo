Rainbow

A shadowy figure, Ritchie Blackmore left deepest purple to re-emerge in Rainbow's splendor. Dark elf Dio's magickal eye and Blackmore's indigo fingers made fine work of this black fairy tale, which also included Cozy Powell on drums. Fans of dark mystik metal should count the Dio albums essential.
