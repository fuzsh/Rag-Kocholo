In early May 1981 I met Whitesnake in Stockholm and conducted a few interviews at a press gathering with the whole band present at the Mosebacke Pub establishment. The chats I had with Jon Lord and David Coverdale are already archived on this blog (see dates below). Here follows the chat that I had with Bernie Marsden (lifted from my publication Deep Purple Magazine 23). It was the only meeting I had with him back in the day. Enjoy.

You are about to release a solo album, “And About Time Too”. Who is on it?

– “Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Cozy Powell, Don Airey, Jack Bruce, Simon Phillips, and a few singers…”.

I hear that David Coverdale is on it.

– “No, David is not singing…”.

I heard that he was involved in some way…

– “Yes, but he is not singing, we wrote five or six songs together for it, he contributed under the name “C.C Songs” on it. It will be out in about three weeks”.

Do you enjoy touring with Whitesnake?

– “Yes, the best part about being in a band is the touring, even now after having been out there for so long. I would go crazy if I only had studio work”.

Can you write songs while being on the road?

– “Sometimes I do it on the road, sometimes at home. It does not really matter to me that much. I can write whenever the inspiration is there. I like “Child Of Babylon” on the new Whitesnake album”.

David is credited on all the songs, apart from him it is mostly you and Micky Moody, the guitarists, that contributes.

– “They are good songs, that is all that matters. If I wrote more songs it would look like I did all the writing. If Bob Seger wrote us a good song, we would use it. If it is good we will use it”.

How do you rate Ritchie Blackmore as a guitar player?

– “He is very good. If you asked me for my Top 10 guitarists, he would not be on that list. Maybe on a Top 50 list. But nobody can knock him, he is good. But I am looking for more blues, people that are good in that field”.

And Tommy Bolin, how do you rate him?

– “Tommy Bolin was really good, he would make it on my Top 10 list. But Ritchie plays like I drive my car sometimes…”.

If you ever felt that Whitesnake is going down that path, would you quit the band?

– “I would think so, we are such good friends in Whitesnake. You will see what I mean tonight, it is real. The problem with most of the Metal players is that they lack feel, it is more based on image. If we ever lose what we have got now I would quit”.

Jimi Hendrix?

– “Number one. He was incredible. It is because of him, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck that I am sitting here right now. He did things with the guitar that nobody had done before. Or since. He was good”.

Who is the best drummer?

– “Ian Smith… No, Paice is unbelievable, I have been so lucky in that I have been able to work with him. I also like Cozy Powell and Jeff Porcaro in Toto. But Ian Paice is the best rock drummer”.

What kind of artists do you listen to?

– “I listen to quite a lot, Little Feat, Steely Dan, Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Bad Company…”.

Where you ever into Deep Purple?

– “I had hardly ever listened to Deep Purple before I joined Whitesnake. I had “Burn” when I was asked to join Paice Ashton Lord. The only records I have heard to this day is “Burn”, “Stormbringer” and “Come Taste The Band”. When Deep Purple was huge I was more into things like The Eagles, Peter Green and a lot of blues stuff. I think Purple were a little too tough for me”.

My opinion is that Whitesnake is pretty close to Deep Purple, it is not Purple but it is…

– “…close, yes. But Jon, Ian and David are who they are and they have a certain identity to what they are doing. This is another band but musicians are who they are. It is the same if I make a solo record, it will sound a bit like Whitesnake. Everybody wants to talk with David, Jon and Ian because they were in Deep Purple, but that was five, six years ago. They are in another group now. And I think that Whitesnake has far more feeling than Purple, way more connected to the blues”.

So where is your “No, I wasn´t in fucking Deep Purple” t-shirt?

(laughs) – “How did you know about that? I was going to wear it today. How on earth did you know? Has somebody told you about it?”.

I think it was mentioned in the UK fan club publication Stargazer.
