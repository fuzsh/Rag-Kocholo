        "text": "Slip Opinions: This page contains clickable hypertext links to read, search, and copy the full text of N.C. Supreme Court and N.C. Court of Appeals slip opinions in Workersâ Compensation and Tort Award cases initially handled by the N.C. Industrial Commission (NCIC). The page also has links to court pages in the contiguous states, plus links to read, search, and copy the full text of both U.S. Supreme Court decisions and the U.S. Code.\n\nNCIC former law clerk and Deputy Commissioner and now Commissioner Jim Gillen and the late Nancy Warren Gregory, law clerk and later Deputy Commissioner, actively assisted in the preparation of the N.C. Supreme Court and N.C. Court of Appeals portions of this page. We have tried to include every precedent-setting case from January 1, 1995 to present. We also included selected slip opinions from 1993 and 1994.\n\nReports per Rule 30(e): The state appellate courts also issue non-precedent-setting reports per Rule 30(e), which we have added since the year 2000 in PDF (Portable Document Format) versions that require the downloading and installation of an Adobe® Acrobat® Reader to view and/or print. On October 7, 2002, the N.C. Supreme Court Order Amended the Rules of Appellate Procedure to Allow Citation of Rule 30(e) Opinions. (NOTE: To avoid confusion, these reports per Rule 30(e) are NOT part of the NCIC database for N.C. Supreme Court and Court of Appeals decisions.)\n\nTo obtain your FREE copy of Adobe® Acrobat® Reader, click here.
