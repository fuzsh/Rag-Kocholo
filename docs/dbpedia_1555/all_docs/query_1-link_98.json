        "text": "January 30, 2022\n\nIn einem kleinen walisischen Dorf arbeitet Evan Evans als Polizist. Normalerweise hat er ein ruhiges Leben, aber dann werden gleich zwei Leichen in den nahen Bergen gefunden. War es ein Unfall, oder war es Mord?\n\n* Meine Meinung *\n\nIch bin sehr positiv überrascht von diesem Buch! Ich bin ein großer Fan der Krimis von Agatha Christie, und irgendwie hat mich dieses Buch tatsächlich ein wenig an diese Krimis erinnert.\n\nDie Figuren sind liebevoll gezeichnet. Die mütterliche Vermieterin des Polizisten, die verliebte Kellnerin und die nette Lehrerin. Alles zwar irgendwie nicht neu, aber dennoch herzerwärmend \"altmodisch\".\n\nDie Handlung ist außerdem spannend, nachvollziehbar und das Ende ist überraschend. Mir hat es einfach Spaß gemacht, dieses Buch zu lesen!\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\nWhy have I not read this series before? I really enjoy this author's books but had not come across Evan Evans until now. And I so enjoyed this first one in the series (plus there are nine more for me to read!)\n\nConstable Evan Evans is a charming young man who cares about people and has a great sense of responsibility. New in the life of the town of Llanfair, he is pursued by a number of women, but has difficulty in approaching the one who really interests him. Then two people die falling off a mountain and Evan believes they were pushed.\n\nIt is a great story with lots of delightful characters, humorous encounters and a beautiful Welsh landscape setting. I loved it!\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nThe small Welsh village of Llanfair at the base of Mount Snowdon was where Constable Evan Evansreturned to from the city. It was good to be back at his childhood home, and he wasn't expecting any serious crimes in the area. But the morning he was notified about a body being found on the mountain, with a second found when he and his police colleagues were working out how to retrieve the man, set Evan thinking. Well versed and travelled in mountain climbing, he knew there were anomalies about how the two men who died. Believing they weren't accidents saw Evan following the clues, which led him looking into the recent past. But would he find the answers - both to the deaths of the climbers, and the destruction of Mrs Powell-Jones' garden?\n\nEvans Above is the 1st in the Constable Evans series by Rhys Bowen and I enjoyed it very much. Evan is a caring, compassionate young man and a good cop, determined to find the answers, even going against what his superiors ordered. I'm looking forward to checking out #2 and recommend this one to fans of the genre.\n\nDecember 13, 2015\n\nA very enjoyable mystery. Very reminiscent of Hamish Macbeth (except the people aren't nearly as silly). I guess maybe people are just a little edgier in North Wales. I really enjoyed this. It has a good meaty mystery as well as delightful characters and setting. Should think of no less from the lady who brought us Lady Georgiana.\n\nJune 11, 2017\n\nWhen two men are found dead on Snowdon, young village policeman Evan Evans suspects foul play, but his superiors blame mountaineering accidents. Evan sets out to investigate. The mystery itself is interesting and not too cosy, but the many lovingly-observed details of life in a village in north Wales do give a warm feel, and there is a lot of humour along the way.\n\nFor instance, the hunky Evan is always trying to avoid endless meals cooked by his motherly landlady. He also has romantic troubles, treated very lightheartedly, as he is pursuing village schoolteacher Bronwyn, but barmaid Betsy is pursuing him - and the landlady keeps dropping hints about her daughter, Sharon. This does get a bit much at times and I would have liked to see Evan facing some romantic competition!\n\nI really enjoyed this book, the first in a series of gentle Welsh mysteries which has just been made available on audible. I just gave this 5 stars on the audible site, as the narrator of the audio book, Roger Clark, is wonderful, with a Welsh accent which really adds to the listening experience - this is the first audio book where I've had no trouble concentrating. But the story itself gets 4 stars from me. I will look forward to listening to others in the series.\n\nJuly 7, 2023\n\n“Listen here, Evans. You’re the village policeman, not bloody Inspector Morse. If I find you poking your nose in where it’s not wanted and going off on hare-brained schemes of your own again, I’ll report you to your chief. Do I make myself clear?”\n\nEvans Above is the first book in the Constable Evans series by award-winning British-born author, Rhys Bowen. Evan Evans hasn’t been back in Llanfair all that long when he is alerted to a body on the mountain. His superior, DS Watkins brings another Constable to photograph the scene, and it is discovered that there are in fact two bodies, in different spots.\n\nWith his mountain-climbing skills, Evans believes the men have been murdered, but Watkins isn’t convinced, and anyway, Caernarfon have their hands full with the assault and murder of an eleven-year-old girl found by the A55, which takes precedence over two likely inexperienced, unfortunate climbers. But “Evan would quietly go on with his snooping until someone told him to stop.”\n\nTurns out the bodies are those of a London policeman and a Liverpool salesman, neither of whose families knew they were in Wales. Evan’s questions tease out a possible link between them, but Watkins remains sceptical. When the potential solution just about falls into his lap, he is uncomfortable with the praise heaped on ‘Evans the Law’ by the village and by his colleagues.\n\nThen another body found on the mountain, this one definitely murdered, puts their earlier arrest in doubt, and Watkins begins to credit his village Constable with some intelligence: they decide to do a little investigating under the radar of the Detective Inspector who insists everything goes by the book.\n\nMeanwhile, even though his landlady, ever intent on feeding him up, is matchmaking him with her granddaughter, and the barmaid at the Red Dragon is very interested, Evan only has eyes for teacher Bronwen Price. The rivalry between the two vicar’s wives keeps him busy chasing up petty complaints, while a competitive attitude between Evans the Meat and Evans the Milk typifies the Welsh village background. Both provide a source of humour in the story, as do his avoidance antics while chaperoning the teen dance.\n\nSetting the first of this cosy crime series in the early 1980s means that the police have access to less technology so need to rely much more on intelligent guesswork. With cultural and current affair references, Bowen easily evokes her era, and her descriptive prose really captures her setting.\n\nShe inserts a few red herrings that distract Evan, keeping the reader guessing and the pages turning. Evan’s detective work is impressive for a village policeman and even the most astute reader is unlikely to guess the perpetrator or motive. This is very enjoyable cosy Welsh crime fiction and #2, Evan Help Us, is eagerly anticipated.\n\nOctober 2, 2018\n\nI knew “Evans Above”, 1997, would be the syrupy type but I love exploring Wales and run the only challenge accommodating all Celtic countries: “Celtic Coasts”. Although I found no resemblance, comparisons to “Hamish Macbeth” scared me. I hated his début so much, a tentative glance at the sequel averted my first ever ‘did not finish’! With five instead of ten stars to express shades of grey, I think of other books that received two stars and know this one is better.\n\nEvan is very likeable and all suspects are plausible. The mystery was complex and some grim topics surprised me but the originating motive was stupid. What is the point of not telling an accomplice where something is? Who would camp without cold weather gear? I like Evan’s interest, Bronwen, who is a beloved schoolteacher. The ending reassures us that attention won’t be wasted on “will or won’t they”. My patience was sufficiently tried by cardboard personalities that not even a polite person like Evan would abide in real life. It is not hard to tell a barmaid that you aren’t interested! It is not hard to tell the minister’s wife that police can’t attend to her every bone to pick. To heck with how villagers interpret associating with a lady!\n\nI was impressed with Evan’s local boss. He asked him to circumvent his trivial superior, who would not have let a country constable investigate murders, despite his insight. I recall now, the star-saving scene was Evan’s appreciation of a Scotland Yard inspector he contacted. He was surprised that someone of real authority answered his own phone and readily gave him cold case files. He made a compelling observation, about being a good leader whose team would willingly work overtime for him. I imagine I will like the sequel.\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\n\n3,5 Sterne für diesen richtig guten Serienauftakt. Rhys Bowen schreibt einfach gute Krimis, tolle Charaktere und mitreißende Settings. Die Person Evan Evans, das Dorf und die leicht schrulligen Dorfbewohner haben mich irgendwie an die Hamish Macbeth-Serie von M.C. Beaton erinnert, nur das hier die Personen durchweg sympathisch sind. Der Kriminalfall war gut konstruiert, besonders zum Ende auch wirklich spannend und die Auflösung nachvollziehbar. Ich muss unbedingt noch die anderen Bücher lesen.\n\nMarch 31, 2012\n\n2.5 Stars\n\nAhh, who doesn't like visiting new places in a cozy mystery book? I love to, especially when they take me to cute little villages and hamlets like Llanfair. This was my first time reading a book by this author and though I've seen some other books written by her I wasn't too familiar with her work.\n\nLucky me this one was chosen as one of the 4 monthly group reads in one of my GoodReads groups. Now while I'm glad that I gave a new author a try (I've been trying to read a lot of new to me authors for the past year or so). I found that this book was lacking in a lot.\n\nFirst off there were at least a DOZEN spelling errors in the book. A DOZEN! In one case one of the supporting character's names was spelled wrong. I for one hate poor editing in books. I know they happen but honestly 12 is 10 times to many for such a short book.\n\nSecond the story was slow. I didn't like how the story jumped around so much and I wish that Evan Evans had had more of a back story but perhaps the author saved that for later books. In any case I felt that there wasn't enough of a build up and I was left wishing to know more about Evan Evans who seemed like a likable enough chap. I felt that there could have been more effort to add substance to the characters who while amusing were lacking.\n\nWhat I did like about the book though was the setting. I really got a nice feel for the setting and felt like I had been transported to Llanfair. I also thought the quirky characters like Evans-the-meat, Evans-the-milk and others lightened the mood. I also liked the murder aspect of the story, of which I didn't see ending the way it did. I also liked the little feud between the two pastor's wives.\n\nI just thought that this book would be more exciting than it was. Yes I understand that it is a COZY mystery but it can have some excitement as well. Even though I had some major issues with this book I will be giving the next book in the series a try just to see if it gets any better but if it doesn't I think I will have to abandon this series and perhaps the author in general. I hope it does because I'd really like to have found a cozy mystery series I can read in its entirety.\n\nI would recommend this one to fans of this author and genre.\n\nJuly 18, 2016\n\nLet me start off by saying that Rhys Bowen is hands down the best historical mystery author I've ever read. She manages to combine true events and her characters so well that you wonder if her characters couldn't have really been at these events. However, I've finished her Royal Spyness series (though I have the ARC for the next one sitting on my Nook!) and her Molly Murphy series, so that left me with only one more series to read; the Constable Evan Evans mystery series. I can say that, though not quite as good as her historical mysteries, this book was excellent!\n\nEvan was an extremely likable character. He was smart, funny, and yet he wasn't perfect, he had his faults, and those faults made him seem like a more relatable character. The rest of the characters were also wonderful, and endearing. I cannot wait to read more about them!\n\nThe setting was absolutely idyllic. Thanks to this book Wales was just added to my bucket list of places I want to visit before I die. The mystery was solid, however, the killer was projected quite forcefully about 10-15 pages before the reveal, which made the reveal slightly disappointing.\n\nOverall a very good book! I will be reading the next one. Highly recommend.\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nI listened to this as an audiobook. I enjoyed it. Definitely a little creepy at times trying to find the murderer and knowing someone was hiding out in the village. Not sure if I'll do more right away but if catch them on a sale or something, would get more.\n\nJuly 2, 2021\n\nBeing a fan of Rhys Bowen's other two series (Molly Murphy and Her Royal Spyness), I thought I'd give her initial effort a looksee. It was okay, though not quite up to par with the other two series. I found Evan kind of boring and have to wonder why three women are chasing him. I guess pickings are slim in the Welsh mountains. I hope he chooses Bronwen (though something tells me we'll have to slough through a bunch of angst featuring Betsy to get the desired outcome).\n\nThe mystery was okay. Not particularly suspenseful. For me, being a quarter Welsh, I most enjoyed the descriptions of the Welsh mountains and countryside. I definitely wish I knew more about Welsh history. I'll probably read the next book since I tend to enjoy Rhys Bowen's writing, but I won't necessarily make it a priority.\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\nI have enjoyed other books by this author from various series and decided to give this one a second chance. I think I picked it up long ago and discarded, but now I find this light/humorous treatment of crime amidst the beauty of Wales to be entertaining. Constable Evan is a character that can bring a smile or two as he valiantly forges ahead in investigating crime when told by his superiors not to.\n\nKindle Unlimited\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nEvans above by Rhys Bowen is the first book in the Constable Evans Mystery series. In the Welsh village of Llanfair, Constable Evan Evans investigates the death of two men pushed off the mountains, while a child killer is also being hunted. A nice start to the series and I enjoyed getting to know the village of Llanfair and surrounding mountains. Constable Evans is likeable and very capable and fits in well. An enjoyable, typically cozy mystery.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nI liked this better than her other royal spy series. Cozy mystery for summer!\n\n3.5⭐\n\nApril 26, 2019\n\nQuick, easy read. Not bad, not great. A very typical British mystery.\n\nFebruary 4, 2011\n\nThe first in the mystery series, Constable Evans, Evans Above feels like a cross between the village life of Agatha Christie with the camaraderie between Inspector Jury and Divisional Commander Brian Macalvie in Martha Grimes' Richard Jury series. Evans has left big-city crime behind for the peace and tranquility of village life in Wales and has no desire to become entangled with any woman. Ahh, to dream for so little...and not get it. Evans soon becomes entangled. With a series of unexplained murders, a village full of matchmakers, and the need to play country politics.\n\nBowen provides a nice sense of the atmosphere and give-and-take of village life with a vague sense of whatever time period in which Llanfair exists. It has a feel of the 1950s but there's a reference to a train robbery of the Royal Mail so I'm guessing that the year is round about 1969 which would make sense for the atmosphere depicted for a small village in the country.\n\nA soft, easy read with engaging characters and realistic dialog. I'm looking forward to reading Evan Help Us.\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\nBook # 1 in the Constable Evans mystery series. I can’t really call it a cozy because our lead character is a policeman, after all, and NOT an amateur sleuth, but it has many of the hallmarks of cozies: a small quaint village setting, a supporting cast of eccentric characters, a nascent romantic interest (or two), and the murders happen off the page.\n\nThere’s clearly a backstory of how PC Evan Evans came to the Welsh village of Llanfair, especially since he seemed on track to become a full-fledged investigator in the big city. But we don’t learn many details here.\n\nI enjoyed the book, though it was a bit slow-moving. PC Evans is a capable man and he has a way of dealing with the village residents that engenders their cooperation and admiration. I liked Major Armstrong, though he had little to do in this book, and I would hope that he appears again in the series. And, of course, I’m interested to see how PC Evans’ love life works out.\n\nJune 30, 2019\n\nEnjoyable cozy murder mystery set in a small village in Wales. I was happy there were no difficult Welsh names to contend with, just some sweet eccentric characters and a solid mystery. Two hikers are discovered dead on the mountain above Llanfair and although the North wales police investigator Sergeant Watkins thinks they are accidental tragedies; Constable Evans is convinced they were pushed to their deaths. The two bodies were discovered at different times & at different places, so are they connected? This first in this series introduces characters and relationships within the village as Constable Evans works with the investigator to discover what really happened. Easy, fun read.\n\nJanuary 28, 2020\n\nGood mystery in a great setting! I hated the way the constable acted around women, though.\n\nLovely narration.\n\nJune 22, 2020\n\n3.5*\n\nA bit too much about Constable Evan Evans' problems with various women in the village but a good mystery & great setting.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nA very good read with a surprising ending.\n\nMarch 14, 2016\n\nWhile the Her Royal Spyness have a sort of sweeping tongue-in-cheek and yes, ridiculous but still cutely charming in its own right story lines (who can say no to Darcy O'Mara?) I'd say the Constable Evans series (though this is the first one I've read) is a little bit more grounded rather than theatrical.\n\nTaking place in modern day Wales (oh Welsh words, I don't even know where to start with you lot) we get a look at the idyllic village life. There's mt. Snowdon, there's a town that knows everything about everyone and perhaps a (Welsh?) custom of addressing the duplicate names in the society by their trade (Evans-the-Meat made me snicker). What could go wrong? Well, being a mystery series, something has to. Deaths on the mountain! Murdering pedophile on the loose! All of this, of course, woven into the small-town life (with one of the minister's wives adamant that the rival minister wife is sabotaging her show tomatoes/apple pie/etc). I think my only complaint is with Evan Evans (yes, that's his name and he hates it too) being a bit wishy-washy in the face of the female race. Stand up for yourself, man! Tell them to shove off! Make sure its known no means no. But then again, he's a nice guy so I guess he'll never do that (and of course we'd lose the romantic intrigue side of it all)\n\nAll in all a fun and easy read. Even made me want to go hiking in Wales.\n\nJuly 24, 2009\n\nPicked this one up as a bookswap, as I'm always on the lookout for first books of new series so I can try stuff out...\n\nThere's a comment on the cover of Evans Above that likens the series to the Hamish Macbeth novels of MC Beaton and that should have told me everything I needed to know about this one. Like the aforementioned novels, Evans Above is about a big-city police officer coming to a small village, this time in the heart of Snowdonia.\n\nThe eponymous Evans becomes involved in a mystery when two bodies are found on the mountain and there seems to be a connection with the death years before of a soldier on training manoeuvres. Naturally, his superior officer doesn't really pay much attention to Evans' theorising and equally naturally, Evans is right and there is a connection.\n\nEvans Above is an enjoyable enough read, even if Bowen pretty much telegraphed who is responsible very early on (or maybe I'm just good at picking these things up?), requiring very little in the way of mental engagement. The series continues in Evan Help Us and clearly this is a series to avoid if you're allergic to bad puns in titles.\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\n2 1/2 stars\n\nCozy British murder mystery set in a charming mountain town but lacking character development. Just not enough backstory and fleshing out of who the main character is. And the slower pace didn't help. It was hard to stay interested in characters one barely knows.\n\nI do think the mystery was clever and well laid out. So I'll probably give this series another shot.\n\nVery pleasant narration by Roger Clark.\n\nDecember 10, 2020\n\nI seem to have read this awhile ago, possibly before Goodreads. A very cute murder mystery taking place in Wales, which added to the enjoyment. Evan Evans is a constable in a little town, very reminiscent of Hamish Macbeth. I liked the dialogue with what I imagine is a Welsh accent, with lots of sentence ending questions. On to the next one.\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nI normally do not read off shore based books, but I picked this up at a booksale and I really did enjoy it. I like that Ms. Bowen writes in the local dialect. I will be moving on in this series."
