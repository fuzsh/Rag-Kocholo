        "text": "Peter Green has always been one of my favourite musicians, so as you can imagine, I was devastated when I heard that he had passed away.\n\nBorn Peter Allen Greenbaum on the 29th of October 1946, to a Jewish family living in Bethnal Green, he displayed an aptitude for music from a young age. His older brother Michael taught him his first guitar chords, and by the age of 11, he was teaching himself. Green started playing professionally at the age of 15 whilst working for a shipping company, but his big break came at the age of 19, in October 1965, when he was given the opportunity to fill in for Eric Clapton in John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers for four gigs. When Clapton left in July 1966, Green became a full-time member. He first met fellow Bluesbreaker, and future Fleetwood Mac bandmate Mick Fleetwood when he was playing lead guitar in Peter Barden’s’ band ‘Peter B’s Looners’ at Christmas 1965.\n\nIn 1966, Green made his recording debut with the Bluesbreakers with the album ‘A Hard Road’ (1967) which featured two of his own compositions, ‘The Same Way’ and one of his first instrumentals ‘The Super-Natural’ which soon became a trademark. After this album, Green was given the nickname “The Green God” by his musician friends.\n\nJohn Mayall & The Bluesbreakers ‘The Super-Natural’\n\nGreen left the Bluesbreakers in 1967, and decided to form his own blues band – ‘Fleetwood Mac’ which consisted of Mick Fleetwood on drums, Jeremy Spencer on guitar, and Bob Brunning temporarily employed on bass Guitar – as Green’s first choice, Bluesbreakers’ bassist John McVie, was not yet ready to join the band. Fleetwood Mac is best known for its fifth line-up, which included Stevie Nicks, Christine & John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and Lindsey Buckingham. However, their early work, which mainly comprised blues covers, and originals mostly written by Green, is severely underrated.\n\nPeter Green rapidly blossomed as a songwriter from 1968 onwards and contributed many successful original compositions, as he began gradually moving the band away from their blues’ roots into new musical territory. ‘Mr Wonderful’ (1968) continued the formula of their first album, and Green’s ‘Black Magic Woman’ was wildly successful and later covered by Santana.\n\nFleetwood Mac – Black Magic Woman\n\nThe guitar-instrumental ‘Albatross’ released in 1969, which features cymbals imitating the sound of waves, reached number one in the British singles charts and brought a new audience to Green’s impeccable guitar-playing. He was always interested in conveying emotion in his songs, rather than demonstrating how fast he could play, and ‘Albatross’ is the epitome of this. It provides a beautiful soundtrack to any emotions that one may be experiencing and is deemed by many to be Green’s magnum opus.\n\nFleetwood Mac – Albatross\n\nMore hits written by Green followed, including ‘Oh Well’, ‘Man of the World’ (Both 1969), and the ominous ‘The Green Manalishi’ (1970). Beginning with ‘Man of the World’s’ melancholy lyrics, Green’s bandmates began to notice changes in his state of mind. He was taking large doses of LSD, grew a beard and began to wear robes and a crucifix, and Mick Fleetwood has commented on how Green began to become concerned about accumulating wealth.\n\n1970 Fleetwood Mac – Peter Green – The Green Manalish Live in Sweden\n\nIn March 1970, whilst touring in Munich, Green took LSD at a party at a commune – and this is in incident often cited by Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis as the crucial point in his mental decline. After a final performance on 20 May 1970, Green left Fleetwood Mac.\n\nGreen appeared at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music with John Mayall, Rod Mayall, Ric Grech, and Aynsley Dunbar on the 27th of June 1970, and that same year he recorded a jam session with drummer Godfrey Maclean, keyboardists Zoot Money and Nick Buck, and bassist Alex Dmochowski of The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation. Reprise Records released the session as ‘The End of the Game’, Peter’s first post-Fleetwood Mac solo album. Musically, this album is experimental and free-form, and bears very little resemblance to any of Green’s other recorded work.\n\nAlso shortly after leaving Fleetwood Mac, Green assisted his former bandmate Peter Bardens on Bardens’ solo LP ‘The Answer’, which features him playing lead guitar on several tracks. When Jeremy Spencer left Fleetwood Mac, Green stepped in to help them complete a U.S tour and took to the stage under the pseudonym Peter Blue.\n\nHe later recorded two tracks for the album ‘Juju’ with Bobby Tench’s band Gass, followed by a solo single, and sessions with B. B. King in London in 1972. At this time Green’s mental illness had become severe, and his drug use frequent – so after an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac’s Penguin LP in 1973, on the song ‘Night Watch’, he faded into professional obscurity. Green was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia, and frequented psychiatric hospitals in the mid-1970s, where he underwent electroconvulsive therapy.\n\nFleetwood Mac – Night Watch\n\nIn 1979, Green began to resurface professionally. With the help of his brother Michael, he was signed to Peter Vernon-Kell’s PVK label and produced a string of solo albums starting with 1979’s ‘In the Skies’ and also making an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac’s double album Tusk, on the song ‘Brown Eyes’, which was released the same year.\n\nFleetwood Mac – Brown Eyes (ft Peter Green)\n\nGreen contributed to ‘Rattlesnake Shake’ and ‘Super Brains’ on Mick Fleetwood’s solo album ‘The Visitor’ in 1981, and he recorded various sessions with several other musicians, most notably the Katmandu album ‘A Case for the Blues’ with Ray Dorset of Mungo Jerry, Vincent Crane from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Len Surtees of The Nashville Teens. In 1986, Peter and his brother Micky contributed to the album ‘A Touch of Sunburn’ by Lawrie ‘The Raven’ Gaines (under the group name ‘The Enemy Within’), which has been reissued many times under such titles as ‘Post Modern Blues’ and ‘Peter Green and Mick Green – Two Greens Make a Blues’. Along with the other members of Fleetwood Mac, Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nFleetwood Mac Acceptance Speech at the 1998 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony\n\nWith the assistance of Nigel Watson and Cozy Powell, the Peter Green Splinter Group was formed in the late 1990s and they went on to release nine blues albums, which were mostly written by Watson, between 1997 and 2004. A tour was cancelled at the beginning of 2004, and the recording of a new studio album stopped when Green left the band and moved to Sweden. Shortly after, he signed on to a tour with the British Blues All-Stars scheduled for the following year. In February 2009, Green began playing and touring again, this time as Peter Green and Friends – they toured the UK and Europe and were supported by Andrew Maxwell Morris during some of their tour dates."
