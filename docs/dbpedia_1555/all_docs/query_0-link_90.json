        "text": "This feature originally ran in 2013. We’re reposting as Black Sabbath’s long, storied career comes to an end.\n\nWelcome to Dissected, where we disassemble a band’s catalog, a director’s filmography, or some other critical pop-culture collection in the abstract. It’s exact science by way of a few beers. This time, we sort through the best and worst of Ozzy Osbourne’s original stomping grounds.\n\nBlack Sabbath is the most influential band in the history of heavy metal. They defined the genre before it even had a definition. The eerie voice of Ozzy Osbourne, the sinister guitar tones of Tony Iommi, and the pessimistic lyrics of Geezer Butler all aligned to form a singular ethos. These were angry souls expressing a grim, realistic point-of-view — one that listeners could relate to.\n\nThe band’s fanbase grew exponentially throughout the 1970s, but success spawned its own demons. Heavy touring and substance abuse led to creative pitfalls and eventual lineup changes, with Iommi remaining the only constant member. The spot of lead singer became a revolving door during the band’s latter years, staining Black Sabbath’s legacy in the ’80s and ’90s. Fortunately, selective memory allows us to enjoy the band’s best moments (the Ozzy and Dio years) and ignore the weaker material.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Sabbath confirming they’ve broken up, it seemed fitting to revisit the catalog that changed metal and heavy music forever.\n\n-Jon Hadusek\n\nContributing Writer\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n19. Forbidden (1995)\n\nThe bitter end: Forbidden is a half-assed atrocity and the worst record to bear the Black Sabbath name. The songs are underwritten, as if they were conceived on the spot, during jam sessions. Adding to the chaos is the production by Body Count’s Ernie C. There’s even a collaboration with Ice T on infamous dud “The Illusion of Power”. The band members themselves have been critical in hindsight, with Tony Martin writing it off as a “filler” that was used to free Black Sabbath from I.R.S. Records and the singer himself.\n\nIn their own words: “We brought in Ernie C to do production, which was a bit difficult really, because I had to leave him to it… It all came together very quickly and we didn’t have time to reflect: make sure it was the right songs and the right way of doing it.” — Tony Iommi (Southern Cross fanzine No. 19, March 1997)\n\nAverage track length: 4:20\n\nBest riff: “Sick & Tired”\n\nCover art deductions: Amateurish; should’ve been rejected.\n\nOnward to 13: Thankfully Black Sabbath would reunite with Ozzy Osbourne to record 13, so we can forget Forbidden entirely. It would’ve been unfortunate had such a weak album been the final statement from such a legendary band.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. Seventh Star (1986)\n\nBlack Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi: …reads the spine of this unfortunate LP that was intended to be a Tony Iommi solo album. It features none of original Sabbath lineup except Iommi; however pressure from the record label forced his hand. You can tell it’s not a Sabbath album when you listen to it; more vanilla hard rock than heavy metal.\n\nPicking over Deep Purple’s scraps: New vocalist Glenn Hughes — also a former Deep Purple singer and bassist — replaced Gillan, who made a quick exit after Born Again.\n\nAverage track length: 3:55\n\nBest riff: “Danger Zone”\n\nCover art deductions: It looks like an Iommi solo album, too.\n\n17. The Eternal Idol (1987)\n\nIntroducing Tony Martin: In all fairness to Sabbath’s various vocalists, replacing Ozzy and Dio is an impossible task. You’ll inevitably be compared to them and inevitably fail. Gillan and Hughes couldn’t handle the heat, which makes the feats of British screamer Tony Martin even more impressive. He sang on five of the last six Sabbath albums, starting with The Eternal Idol. He fits the mold better than the Deep Purple guys, though he’s almost too good at times: like a talented session singer impersonating Dio.\n\nAverage track length: 4:40\n\nBest riff: “Ancient Warrior”\n\nIn their words: “I’d like to have seen some of the stuff off The Eternal Idol be a bit more credited, because I think there’s some good tracks on that album.” — Tony Iommi (Southern Cross fanzine No. 19, March 1997)\n\nCover art deductions: The artwork was supposed to be a photo of the Auguste Rodin sculpture “The Eternal Idol”, but rights were not obtained. Instead, they painted up two nude models and recreated the sculpture (with remarkably realistic detail).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Cross Purposes (1994)\n\nA band on life support: Black Sabbath should have given up the ghost when Dio left for the second time. Instead, Iommi brought back Tony Martin and trudged onward. It’s hard to tell whether Iommi’s heart is really in it. He’ll unleash impressive rockers (“Virtual Death”) and then spew second-rate Clapton blues (“Dying for Love”). Martin appears to have lost his high-pitch wail by this point, and his performance feels limited.\n\nAverage track length: 4:45\n\nBest riff: “Evil Eye”. It is purported that the riff was written by Eddie Van Halen, who went uncredited.\n\nCover art deductions: Meh.\n\n15. Born Again (1983)\n\nThat one time Ian Gillan joined Black Sabbath: Born Again is best forgotten. Deep Purple’s Ian Gillan came on to replace Dio and delivers an erratic vocal performance. Gillan and Iommi just don’t seem to have a feel for one another as they awkwardly stumble over lackadaisical riffs and ill-timed breakdowns.\n\n“Disturbing the Priest”: A weak album, but track it down for this song alone. It’s a maniacal gem and one the most sinister compositions in Iommi’s songbook.\n\nAverage track length: 4:36\n\nBest riff: “Zero the Hero”\n\nBest studio manipulation: Gillan’s laughter at the beginning of “Disturbing the Priest” is truly evil.\n\nCover art deductions: A fucked up devil child. I dig it.\n\n14. Tyr (1990)\n\nWhen all else fails, sing about Vikings: Tyr tries to appeal to your inner warrior but ends up sounding like Spinal Tap. Even lyrics about Norse mythology can’t save uninspired riff writing (which is again plagued by thin production).\n\n“Feels Good To Me”: This saccharine ballad interrupts the Viking-themed content of Tyr, and its inclusion on the album has been an issue of contention among hardcore fans. Singer Tony Martin stated in a Q&A that the song was only included solely so that it could be released as a single.\n\nAverage track length: 4:27\n\nBest riff: “Heaven in Black”\n\nCover art deductions: Bland.\n\n13. Technical Ecstacy (1976)\n\nThe (de)evolution of Black Sabbath: Technical Ecstasy is where Black Sabbath changed, and not for the better. On one hand, the songs had become more complex, flowery, and aurally varied — nothing wrong there. But it’s awkwardly executed by Iommi, who produced the album. Instead of coming off as progressive, these experiments reek of a band losing touch with the traits that made them great. The studio effects and synthesizers often overtake the bass and guitar.\n\nIn which Bill Ward sings lead vocals (at the behest of Ozzy): One of the most controversial tunes in the band’s catalog, “It’s Alright” is sung by drummer Bill Ward, supposedly at the encouragement of Ozzy himself. It was the first time someone besides Osbourne sang on a Sabbath LP, and the song isn’t awful. Kinda sounds like Badfinger.\n\nAverage track length: 5:04\n\nBest riff: “Dirty Women”\n\nCover art deductions: What Ozzy described as “two robots screwing on an escalator” is actually the work the late Storm Thorgerson (the legendary Pink Floyd artist) and his graphic design team Hipgnosis. Not a bad sleeve by any means, it’s just not very Sabbath-y.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Dehumanizer (1992)\n\nThe return of RJD: The metal community rejoiced when Tony Iommi announced that Ronnie James Dio, Geezer Butler, and Vinny Appice would join him for a new Sabbath record. 1992’s Dehumanizer was a return to form, albeit being slower and angrier. Dio reclaimed his old duty of lyricist and ditched the Norse topics in favor of science fiction (computers overthrowing humanity, time travel, etc.).\n\nIt ends so soon: Dio’s contract with the band expired in November 1992 (it’s as if Iommi was running a sports team at this point). He would not re-up.\n\nAverage track length: 5:12\n\nBest riff: “Buried Alive”\n\nCover art deductions: I need to buy a giant poster of this.\n\nHeaven & Hell, the band: Although Dio left on shaky terms, he would reunite with this lineup in 2006 for The Devil You Know (recorded under the moniker Heaven & Hell). The group played shows until Dio’s death from stomach cancer in 2010.\n\n11. Headless Cross (1989)\n\nPolarizing production: It’s 1989 and glam metal has taken over. You know the drill: Douse the vocals with reverb and echo delay, thin out the drums, poof up the hair, and then send that shit to Headbanger’s Ball. Co-produced by Iommi and new drummer Cozy Powell, Headless Cross suffers from dated, ‘80s production gimmicks. A shame considering this is some of the finest music Iommi wrote during the era. The title track is super catchy, and “The Gates of Hell” and “When Death Calls” conjure the evil spirits of vintage Sabbath.\n\nAverage track length: 5:00\n\nBest riff: “Headless Cross”\n\nBest studio manipulation: The chilling atmospherics of intro “The Gates of Hell”\n\nCover art deductions: A bleak illustration that reflects the mood of the music.\n\n10. Never Say Die! (1978)\n\nAiming for FM: The last album to feature Ozzy Osbourne, Never Say Die! is straight-up pop rock, primed for heavy rotation. But it’s not without its merits. Iommi’s guitar isn’t buried like it was on Technical Ecstacy, and the rigid melodies force his playing to be concise and punchy. Ozzy sings this hookier material with confidence (something he’d perfect on his solo LPs Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman).\n\nFarewell, Ozzy Osbourne: Iommi and the rest of the band fired Osbourne in 1979, citing the singer’s obstinacy, unpredictable behavior, and excessive substance abuse — which Ozzy claims was no worse than that of his bandmates.\n\nAverage track length: 5:04\n\nBest riff: “Air Dance”\n\nCover art deductions: Another Hipgnosis sleeve. I feel nothing when I look at it.\n\n09. 13 (2013)\n\nThe End of the Beginning or the Beginning of the End?: 13 is a return to form — if a somewhat obvious one — and an example of perseverance. Ozzy gives a strong performance despite an aging voice, Geezer Butler’s lyrics are as pessimistic as ever, and Iommi conjures the tones of old. Given all the distractions surrounding the record’s release, it’s shocking how well everything fits together. For a record 13 years in the making, 13 is worth the wait.\n\nAverage track length: 6:41\n\nBest riff: “God Is Dead?”\n\nCover art deductions: Given it’s their last album, the funeral pyre-style 13 seems fitting enough.\n\n08. Mob Rules (1981)\n\nGive the fans what they want: Mob Rules feels like a direct sequel to Heaven & Hell, both conceptually and sonically. The band brought back producer Martin Birch to recreate the latter, and Appice stayed on as drummer after the tour. Although the album isn’t as instantly memorable as its predecessor, songs such as the rollicking title track, “The Mob Rules”, remain some of Dio-era Sabbath’s staple recordings. That one in particular was immortalized after its inclusion on the soundtrack to animated cult classic Heavy Metal.\n\nAverage track length: 4:24\n\nBest riff: “The Mob Rules”\n\nBest studio manipulation: “E5150” — Iommi’s attempt at musique concrÃ¨te.\n\nCover art deductions: Wouldn’t want to mess with that mob.\n\nFarewell, Ronnie James Dio: He left the band to pursue successful solo career and wield giant claymores in music videos. He’d rejoin Sabbath to record Dehumanizer in 1992.\n\n07. Sabotage (1975)\n\nThe doom side, the pop side: The tracklist on Sabotage is arranged strategically, with metal songs occupying side A and all the poppier excursions on side B. Sabotage can be viewed as a literal transition from the pioneering power of their early days to the softer tendencies of their late ‘70s output. “Symptom of the Universe” and “Megalomania” would be the last time we’d hear Ozzy-era Sabbath playing pure, unadulterated heavy metal.\n\nAverage track length: 5:28\n\nBest riff: “Symptom of the Universe”\n\nBest lyrical couplet: “Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes / I mixed reality with pseudogod dreams”\n\nCover art deductions: Bill Ward’s red tights. ‘Nuff said.\n\n06. Heaven and Hell (1980)\n\nHello, Ronnie James Dio: After Ozzy’s termination, Tony Iommi peered across the metal landscape and spotted a tiny man with the voice of a god. Enlisting former Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio as lead singer lit a fire under Iommi’s ass. He started writing metal again and the result was Heaven and Hell — a Black Sabbath revival. The guitars were barreling along at top speed, Ward was keeping the pace, and Butler’s bass surged louder than it had in years. Tragically, this success was shortlived for one member…\n\nThe classic lineup collapses: Bill Ward’s alcoholism had been a growing concern over the years and finally reached a breaking point during the Heaven & Hell tour. He withdrew from the band and was replaced by drummer Vinny Appice.\n\nIn their own words: “The Heaven and Hell album was a real landmark… It reintroduced this music back to a lot of people.” — Ronnie James Dio[1]\n\nAverage track length: 5:00\n\nBest riff: “Heaven and Hell”\n\nBest couplet: “Sing me a song, you’re a singer / “Do me wrong, you’re a bringer of evil”\n\nCover art deductions: Artist Lynn Curlee’s literal interpretation of the album cover.\n\n05. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973)\n\nGot heavy-metal writer’s block? Rehearse in a castle dungeon: It worked for Tony Iommi. Unsurprisingly, the band — consumed by coke and booze — hit a creative wall while attempting to write songs in L.A. They would relocate to a castle in England and find solace in the dungeons, which became their new rehearsal space.\n\nIn their own words: “Ideas weren’t coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent. Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn’t think of anything. And if I didn’t come up with anything, nobody would do anything.” — Tony Iommi (The Story of Black Sabbath by Steven Rosen)\n\nSabbath expand their sound: Producer Tom Allom introduced Iommi to various instruments during the recording process, and many of these new sounds made it on to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (the moog synth on “Who Are You?”, vocoders on “Sabbra Cadabra”). These sonic experiments would culminate on the next two albums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAverage track length: 5:19\n\nBest riff: “Sabbra Cadabra”\n\nBest couplet: “You work your life away and what do they give? / You’re only killing yourself to live”\n\nCover art deductions: Drew Struzan’s painting is both sexy and hellacious — a definitive piece of metal artwork and arguably the finest sleeve in Sabbath’s discography. The back of the LP depicts a more somber scenario."
