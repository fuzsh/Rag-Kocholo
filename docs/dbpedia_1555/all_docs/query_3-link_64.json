Please send news to your class secretary, listed at the end of the class columns, or submit directly to classnotes.editor@unh.edu. The deadline for the next issue is May 1.\n\nJump to Year\n\nOrganized winter sports at UNH began in 1922, when President Ralph Dorn Hetzel appointed a committee to form an outing club. The resultant Winter Sports team competed in skating, hockey, boxing and baseball, as well as skiing — then regarded the “elite” athletic endeavor of the five. In the early years, there weren’t many women who skied (Charlotte Boothroyd Chase ’38 was quoted in a UNH Magazine story many years ago, ruefully noting that they were nonetheless encouraged to spectate), but by 1947 women’s skiing was well established, with its team members practicing and competing alongside their male counterparts at Durham’s Beech Hill, just a short trek from campus.\n\nUNIVERSITY ARCHIVES\n\nNancy Bryant on behalf of Lonnie (Eleanor) Gould Bryant\n\n9 Rickey Drive\n\nMaynard, MA 01754\n\nbryantnab@yahoo.com; 978-501-0334\n\nI am sorry to report that Betty Browne Cheeseman passed away at her home in Wenham, MA, on Oct. 21, 2020. After graduating from UNH, Betty worked at the Sleighton Farm Girls School near Philadelphia. In 1942, she married Herbert Cheeseman and traveled with him stateside while he served in the U.S. Army until he was sent to the Pacific Theater. After World War II, the couple settled in Wenham, where they raised three children, all of whom became Air Force officers. Betty was very active in community affairs in Wenham, establishing an in-school library at the Buker School, serving as a public library trustee, and volunteering for the Wenham Museum and the First Church Women’s Guild. Betty was passionate about the Girl Scouts of America, serving as a troop leader and council vice president and receiving the rarely awarded 75-Year Pin in 2017. Betty enjoyed traveling, sewing, board games and nature. To quote her obituary, “she valued the beauty of this world and lived a caring and peace-seeking life.” Betty was predeceased by her beloved husband of 72 years, her son Alan and her daughter Marsha and is survived by her son Gary, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. We send our heartfelt condolences to her family. The Class of ‘41 was part of the Greatest Generation, growing up in the Great Depression and then facing the challenges of World War II right after graduating from UNH. I feel privileged to write about them in this column. And I am often struck by the attributes that our long-lived 41’ers share in common: a strong commitment to community service, an appreciation of nature, a joyful love of family, and a zest for living. May we all continue to learn from their example!\n\nJoan Lamson ’49 (center) celebrated her 93rd birthday — and daughter and class of 1973 alumna Cindy Lamson Siegler’s 70th — with food and funny stories around a fire pit, brought to her New London, NH, home by her other daughter, Deb Lamson ’75.\n\n1949\n\nJoan Boodey Lamson\n\n51 Lamson Lane\n\nNew London, NH 03257\n\nunhjblamson@gmail.com\n\nHere’s what we did, during our dreadful pandemic, to celebrate special days. My daughter Deb Lamson ’75 and her husband Chuck Pinkerton brought a fire pit here from their home in Portsmouth on the day before Thanksgiving. We sat around the fire eating turkey sandwiches and thought of American Indians sitting in this same lakeside spot, cooking over their fire, the plentiful trout they had caught in Pleasant Lake. On the Wednesday before Christmas (heavy rain due on Christmas) we ate hot soup around the fire, sang carols and exchanged gifts. And now on January 15 we are celebrating my 93 years, and daughter Cindy Lamson ’73 Siegler’s big 70 with food and very funny stories around the fire pit. Don’t plan big dinners, and be flexible with the date, because you can’t control the weather! President Dick Dart is still finding the most unusual, humorous, reminiscent and heart-warming pictures, sayings, and exotic places on his computer, and sending them to a big list of friends, including me. Phyllis Karpinski Martin is still living in Newport, NH, where she and her husband brought up their eight children; but she is now residing up on the hill in Summercrest. Donald Lake, who died on Aug. 13, 2020, in Waterbury, CT, at age 9 was an 18-year-old freshman at UNH when he enlisted in the Army. He landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and later was in the Battle of the Bulge and entered Berlin July 3,1945. Returning home, he married his childhood sweetheart Mary “Mig” Dame and they enjoyed 69 years together, until her death in 2016. After UNH Don earned a Ph.D. in organic chemistry at the University of Delaware and then he worked 32 years for DuPont in Wilmington. In 2008 they moved to Litchfield to be near their daughter and family; their son and his family live in California. They have five grandchildren, too. Caroline “Carol” Eaton Huddleston passed away at her home in Lancaster last August with her family at her side. Carol and her husband John brought up four children, and later enjoyed five grandchildren and five great grandchildren. She was predeceased by John as well as son John “Jay” Huddleston. Carol’s career was as a nutritionist at Weeks Memorial Hospital and for 20 years at the Coos County Nursing Home in Berlin, and she was a dedicated EMT volunteer of the Lancaster Ambulance Corps. Her family and friends will never forget the homemade donuts, English muffins, jams and zucchini relish she loved to make for them. Charles Farwell, Jr., who graduated with a degree in psychology, died in March 2020 in his hometown of Nashua, NH. Charlie later graduated from the New England Institute of Anatomy and Funeral Directing and joined his father in the operation of the Farwell Funeral Service, and then served as the executive director of the funeral home for over 50 years. He was a founding member of Home Health and Hospice Care in Nashua. Charlie married his high school sweetheart Blanche “Bianca” Soucy, and they shared 68 years together. They have four children and three grandkids. In retirement they enjoyed winters at Daytona Beach Shores and summers with family and longtime friends in New Hampshire. I will close with the last verse of a Christmas time poem written by Bill Batchelder in 1940 when he was 14 years old and sent to me by his wife Betty: “The angels sing again this year/Their song of “Hope and Peace/And may their message of goodwill/Never, never cease.” Happy New Year; may 2021 hear this message!\n\nAnn Merrow Burghardt\n\n411 Wentworth Hill Road\n\nCenter Sandwich, NH 03227\n\nalces1@myfairpoint.net\n\nAs we move from octogenarian to nonagenarian status, a couple of classmates are taking it in stride. Reports Elaine Henderson Steeger, who with husband Charlie has relocated to Needham, MA, being “in assisted living has been great; no more cooking, thank heavens.” Says Jere Lundholm: “Now that this is my 90th year, I hung up my skis. My mind wants to continue, but my body says no.” The Lundholms (Harriet Forkey ‘54) have sold their NH mountain home and are full-timers in Durham. Our class president, “Huck” (Walter) Kean of Wenham, MA, died on Oct, 18, 2020. A member of Theta Kappa Phi, Huck played football and baseball and was a member of Scabbard and Blade. He was inducted into the UNH Athletics Hall of Fame and received the Alumni Meritorious Service Award for being class president for 50 years. He served in Korea as an Army First Lieut. and worked for GE and ITT. For many years he hand-made stained glass art pieces for customers and friends. Huck is survived by his wife, Janice Regan ’54, a son and daughter. Robert Mosher of New Cumberland, PA, died on July 15, 2020, at home. A civil engineering major, he had worked for the former Bethlehem Steel Corp. after Army service in Korea. He had been a volunteer AARP tax preparer, and enjoyed hunting, baseball and golf. Gainesville, GA, resident Ann Van Allen Holmes died July 28, 2020. She was an occupational therapy major, a member of Theta U, Sophomore Sphinx, Women’s Glee Club, and the Outing Club. Charles Kenneth Hutchines of Durham died Aug. 4, 2020. A mechanical engineering major, he worked for NACA, a precursor to NASA; Simplex Wire and Cable; Taco, Inc, and finally Fram Corp in E. Providence, RI for more than 25 years. When he retired in 1991, he held several patents. Ken was a lifelong member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and had climbed the 100 highest mountains in New England. He taught white water canoeing, had a passion for radio control airplanes and enjoyed sailing, water skiing, oil painting and wood working. Hampton, NH, resident Denis Kilroy died April 10, 2020, at his home. Denis was a member of SAE, Scabbard and Blade, Arnold Air Society, the Outing Club and played baseball for four years. Richard Fitts of Exeter, NH, a geology major and member of Phi Mu Delta, died Sept. 21, 2020. Dick was a factory engineer and worked for Simplex Wire and Cable in Newington, Miniature Precision Bearings in Keene, GTE Sylvania in Exeter, and was plant manager for GTE Syltron in Luquillo, P.R. His love of the outdoors led to years of hiking, gardening and travel. Charles Bartlett of Erwin Township, MI, died Oct. 23, 2020. After graduating with a degree in forestry, he served as an Army 1st Lieut. in Korea, then worked for the US Forest Service, first in the NH White Mountains, later transferring to the USFS in Kentucky. More USFS work was in Arkansas and then Michigan as a ranger in the Ottawa National Forest until retirement. He was an avid fly fisherman and enjoyed anything related to the outdoors.\n\n1954\n\nRuth Nash Clark\n\n149 East Side Drive #294\n\nConcord, NH 03301\n\nclark603@yahoo.com; 603-715-2493 or 603-828-6885 (cell)\n\nConnie Miltimore Best, who was a friend to so many, died recently at her home in Augusta, ME, surrounded by her family, following a bout with cancer. Miltie was a phys ed. major, member of Theta U, active in Outing Club, Mortar Board, played softball, hockey, participated in interhouse sports, Camp Counselors Club, Ski Club and more. The list is long, as you can see in your yearbook. As her roommate at Theta U I had a chance to appreciate her great sense of humor and infectious laugh, as will many of you as you read and recall her life at UNH. She made the most of her four years at UNH and those who knew her loved her! Her little jokes “on deck” when many were trying to sleep were priceless and timed perfectly. She had a busy life after UNH, teaching and enjoying life until the end. Miltie set a great example for all who knew her, as her life showed her great personality and interest and excitement about so many things! Others who have died since the last magazine include John Hood, Jerry Fitzgerald, Nelson McLean, Lincoln Fenn, Jo Flood, Liz Blanchard, Seymour Sargent, Charles Pray, Lawrence Guay, Tom Clarkson, Norma Claffin Spinks, Eugene Franciosi, Al Landry, Marcel Boisvert and Hugo Riciputi. There have never been so many names on my list as this time; I am not going to write much so as not to dwell on unhappy news. If you want more information on any particular individual, please reach out to me. We all wish for another reunion as soon as possible! Meanwhile, I hope everyone will stay safe, & watch for news from UNH when it becomes available. It would be nice if we could meet in 2021, but we’ll have to wait to see how things go for UNH and all of us. Meanwhile, my hope is for a normal football season with our great Wildcat team and the UNH Marching Band. both of which are amazing! Go CATS!\n\n1956\n\nJoan Holroyd\n\n5 Timber Lane, Unit 213\n\nExeter, NH 03833\n\njoanholroyd@gmail.com\n\nHope you are all coping with COVID with no great changes in routine. Here at RiverWoods the restrictions in lifestyle are sometimes annoying! At least we can go off-campus for errands, appointments and visits to family or friends. I was hoping to have some happy news to share, but no such luck. Reporting the obituaries seems to be part of the ‘job title,’ however! On July 7, 2020, we lost Paul McGrath of West Palm Beach, FL. He was a native of Alton Bay, NH, and entered the Army after graduation. He served as an anti-aircraft artillery officer through the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Later Paul worked for HUD as a finance specialist and appraiser, retiring in 2011. He is survived by his wife, Gail, two sisters, and many nieces and nephews. Following a long period of ill health, Mary McDaniel Dubois died on July 7 in Dover, NH. She had been the valedictorian of the Class of 1952, and a Phi Beta Kappa at UNH, receiving a degree in Medical Technology. She is survived by her husband, LTC(R) Raymond Dubois, a daughter, Dr. Susan Dubois, a son, Captain (R) Matthew Dubois (USN) and three grandsons. Also in July, Hazen F. Gale Sr. succumbed from the coronavirus. He resided most of his life in Fairfax, VA, and was predeceased by his wife, Betty. The survivors include four children, six grandchildren, and three brothers. On Aug. 30, we lost Ronald Mason of Hamilton, MA.

In addition to his wife and two daughters, he leaves four grandchildren. Alden Norman of Alton Bay passed away on September 4. Raised in Beverly, MA, he developed a love of golf and played on a state championship team. He received a scholarship in New Mexico, but transferred to UNH, where he earned a degree in chemical engineering. Alden’s long career took him to Pennsylvania, California and London. He ended his professional life as President and CEO of the Badger Co. in Cambridge, MA. Although he returned with his family every summer to their lake house in NH, they golfed each winter in Florida, Ireland, and Scotland. Survivors include his wife, four children, and one grandchild. Lastly, we lost Mary Bierweiler Ward of Portsmouth on Oct. 20. She earned a degree in secondary education and taught for several years. Mary then became an “Avon lady,” a position she loved, for 50 years. Mary was active in several women’s and educational groups. She and Carl had one daughter and one grandson. As always, I welcome your news. Please stay healthy and safe.\n\n1957\n\nNancy Jillson Glowacki\n\n117 Woodbridge Drive\n\nHendersonville, NC 28739\n\njonaglowacki@morrisbb.net; 828-606-5201\n\n“As said by Lao Tzu “LIFE is a series of natural, spontaneous changes. Don’t resist them – that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.” We now access our UNH magazine via a specific online link https://magazine.unh.edu. We hope you are enjoying the new format! We have received news to share about the passing of seven classmates. Their obituaries are truly amazing accounts of full individual lives played out using their natural gifts, skills, passions and family relationships. John A. Goodrich, 85, of Fort Myers, FL, died on July 5, 2020. A native of Braintree MA, John earned a BS from UNH in 1957 and a Master’s in Education from Keene State in 1968, followed by service in the Army and adjutant general corps.

News item: The Class of 1957 Endowed Scholarship was awarded to Shea C. Philbrook from Brookline, NH, and a business administration major. Congratulations! Please send news of yourselves to me, your class secretary, so you can connect with classmates!\n\n1958\n\nPeggy Ann Shea\n\n100 Tennyson Avenue\n\nNashua, NH 03062-2535\n\npeggy.shea@alumni.unh.edu\n\nThe university has sent information on the endowed funds established and/or supported by our class. On June 30, 2020, at the end of the fiscal year, the market value of these three funds was as follows: Scholarship Fund ($107,471); Music Fund ($89,392), University Museum Fund ($119,597). During the 2020 fiscal year, donations of $1800 were received for the Scholarship Fund. As mentioned in the previous column, Lilly Friedman of Holderness, NH, was the recipient of a scholarship from this fund. I will ask the University Foundation to provide details of the distributions from the other two funds. Bill Nelson sent a brief note saying “I, like most of our classmates, continue to get older and stay at home.” I am fairly certain most of us “stayed at home” during the pandemic months of 2020 and 2021. If some of you were able to safely get “out and about,” please let me know so that I can share this information with the rest of our classmates. During the first few months of the pandemic, I spent several weeks, together with several other scientists, doing historical research via the internet on the unusual solar-terrestrial event in January 1938. The resulting scientific paper was published in Astrophysical Journal. I have received the following information about our classmates who have recently passed away. Charles F. Bowman of Candia, NH, was a self-employed businessman in the areas of sales and a number of manufacturing projects. In addition, he was a certified tree farmer and served as a director of the Rockingham County Extension Service Council. Dorothy Morrill Gilman of Weare, NH, worked as a legal secretary in Nashua until her retirement. Cynthia Speerin Lawrence of Germantown, WI, had a life-long love of nature and animals with a hobby of riding, driving and breeding horses. For many years she competed in a range of equine driving shows and won a championship in her final carriage driving event at the age of 72. Arthur H.

In early December 2020, a Zoom meeting was held with classmates from both the Classes of 1960 and 1961, under the guidance of Corena Garnas from the Alumni Office. As you may recall, we had planned on a joint reunion with the Class of 1961 for June 2021. As time went on, it became obvious that the pandemic would force us to postpone our reunion yet again. Two options were discussed: We could gather during Homecoming Weekend (October 2021) or have it in June 2022. After some discussion, it was felt that having the reunion on Saturday only during the Homecoming Weekend was the better option. Another Zoom meeting took place on Jan. 14, 2021, again with members from both classes present. The following schedule of events for the combined 1960 and 1961 reunion on Saturday, Oct. 2, 2021, was presented: Registration from 9 a.m. to noon at the Elliott Alumni Center with light refreshments available in the 1925 Room. From 12:30 to 1:45 p.m. we will have the Wildcat Luncheon in the Piscataqua Room of Holloway Commons to celebrate our legacy at UNH with President Jim Dean and Jan Dean. A campus bus tour for those interested will take place from 1:45 to 3 p.m. The Homecoming Game will begin at 3:30, with a block of stadium seating made available for reunion classes. For those not attending the game, the Alumni Center will remain open until 5 p.m. For anyone interested, we could meet later at Newick’s Lobster House Restaurant on Dover Point Road to end our reunion day. A block of rooms will be reserved for anyone wishing to stay overnight at a local hotel or at a Portsmouth hotel. More information can be found at UNH.edu/reunions. Condolences are offered to the families of these classmates. William M. Wakefield of Oakland Park, FL, passed away on Dec. 16, 2019. Sylvia R. Thibodeau of Auburn, NH, passed away peacefully on Feb. 29, 2020, with her loving daughter at her side. Howard (Gene) Skillings of Portland, ME, died after suffering a stroke on July 10, 2020.

In 1996 he was inducted into the UNH Hall of Fame and continues to hold records for number of rebounds in a single game, rebounds in a single season and single season rebounding average. Finally, I was informed by Gina Damiano, director of donor relations, that the following students were recipients of the Class of 1960 Endowed Scholarship Fund: Clarissa R. Gowing of Exeter, NH is an English major and Isaah J. Gray, majoring in homeland security, is from Somersworth, NH.\n\n1961\n\nPat Gagne Coolidge\n\nP.O.

He earned a degree in agricultural economics at UNH. He served in the Army and worked for the US Forestry Service before he and wife Ruth ’63 established The Owen Farm on Brockway Road, Hopkinton, which served as a refuge and community resource for more than 50 years. Derek worked a variety of other jobs, too, including, running a propane delivery service, installing and maintaining composting toilets and building homes and traditional stone walls. He served the Town of Hopkinton and the state of NH for over 20 years on the Conservation Commission and was a member of the NH Legislature for 10 years.

State Route 89-A\n\nSedona, AZ 86336\n\npolly.daniels@alumni.unh.edu\n\n2021! Here at last and, hopefully, as I write this (January) we will be well into a new year filled with peace and promise; hope, cures and contentment. We each have to do our part though! Embarrassing indeed for me to send the Class Notes Editor “nothing” once again; nothing as in the absence of anything… like news from classmates. I have long gone past the thought that I would make up stories about you. Now I am thinking how nice it would be if some brave souls out there would send me something…perhaps you could raise questions about UNH today that would send me out in quest of answers from our university? Perhaps you would like to hear from someone you’ve “just” thought of…having not thought of that person in years! I can track ‘em down and duly report! It is always nice and, indeed, inspiring to hear what the rest of us are doing! Seeing there is no one near me to raise a question or to begin a thought (and I am beginning to talk to myself!), I will start with me! I am back into hiking the Red Rocks of Sedona after months off the trails; Sedona has been overrun with tourists for many, many months…pursuing, I am sure, the need to get out and away to somewhere quiet and safe. Such as The Briar Patch Inn in Oak Creek Canyon (my place of employment lo these many years!), just three miles out of the hustle and bustle of town. Here’s a novel thought! Come out and see me! We’ll make stories to share with the rest of you (Free tour guiding services at YOUR service!)\n\n1965\n\nJacqueline Flynn Thompson\n\nPO Box 302\n\n197 Cross Hill Road\n\nWilmot, NH 03287\n\nthompson2004@tds.net\n\n55th Reunion ◆ Homecoming Weekend, Oct. 2, 2021\n\nCongratulations to all of you who may be celebrating 50- or 55-year wedding anniversaries. Chuck and I are blessed to celebrate our 55th this year. Because of the pandemic, we were limited in our celebration to a visit to Ogunquit, Maine, meeting Ralph and Judy (Corbett) Young for an outside lunch and visit as well as with two other classmates, Armand Francoeur and Kay Ruma. Another new item of interest is connecting by email with Dave Schriftgiesser, Chuck’s roommate. Dave worked for the Bell System companies most of his career, in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois and finally New Jersey, where he retired in 2001. He and his wife Barb especially enjoy sailing to many ports around the world and spending time at their getaway in South Carolina. Now to pass along condolences to the families of several classmates. First is my good friend, roommate and Phi Mu sister Pat (Brown) Smidth, who passed away in Poinciana, FL, after two years of serious illness. She leaves her husband of 36 years, Frank, and several other family members. Pat’s first career was teaching 6th grade math. Her second career was software development and management with Western Electric, retiring in 2000 from Lucent Technologies. Robert Quinn died in Venice, FL, after courageously battling Parkinson’s. Bob was band director and director of music in Dover, NH, and became concert and band director at Westbrook (Maine) High School. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Barbara (Foote) Quinn, and other family. Bonnie O’Brien of Shrewsbury, MA, earned an MLS and eventually became library director at the Worcester (MA) Public Library. Bonnie was elected to the MLS Hall of Fame in 2010. She is survived by her sister, Bette (O’Brien) Kirby ’65 and several other family members. Dennis Livingston of Sanbornton, NH, lost his long battle with Parkinson’s and dementia in April. Dennis served in Vietnam and worked as a plant manager locally and in California. Robert King was well known for his trumpet-playing during his Navy days and beyond and became a music educator as the instrumental music teacher for grades 4-12 in Limestone, ME, for 33 years. Whitney Johnson unexpectedly passed away in May after succumbing to a heart attack while riding his bicycle in North Carolina, where he had lived since 2015. He leaves behind his wife of 22 years, Gloria (Reed). More obituaries, unfortunately. Ronald Dean spent years in NH before he and his wife Sharon Welch Dean moved to Oregon. He especially enjoyed playing his guitar at open mic sessions and backyard jams. He and Sharon traveled extensively in the US and many foreign countries. Bruce Gilbert of Rye, NH, died in July 2020, and is survived by his wife of 52 years Janet (Ricard) Gilbert and many family members. He played on UNH’s undefeated 1962 football team. Bruce loved athletics and served his community as president of the UNH 100 Club as well as serving on many other boards. He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity. Rosemary Daly died in Lenox, MA, in September. She was a history teacher at Taconic High School, retiring in 2020. Rosemary excelled in art with many of her paintings shown in art shows. She is survived by her husband Walter. Charles Thayer also died in September after a battle with dementia. Ann Hathaway Peters passed away in September. Her professional career was devoted to giving people access to excellent healthcare, regardless of their ability to pay. She was CEO of Lamprey Health Care for 32 years and served on numerous health care boards, receiving many awards for her service. On a lighter note, Maida (Hoag) Atkins has retired in Venice, FL, moving to a retirement community to enjoy the rest of these “Golden Years.” Marlene Brigida Baldwin and her husband Harrison remain active in the Keene, NH, area. As with the rest of us, Marlene has been keeping up with church, community and meetings via Zoom. They celebrated their 24th anniversary in July at the inn where they were married. Ingrid Norman Wilikens is still enjoying golfing when the snow melts in NH. She especially enjoyed a trip to Florida to celebrate grandchildren’s birthdays. Frank (Skip) Hubbard and wife Karen divide their time between NH and Florida, with visits with family in Chicago and San Francisco, and walking and golfing together when the weather permits. As you know, our 55th reunion didn’t happen in 2020. But hold on. The Reunion Committee met virtually and overwhelmingly decided to plan a reunion during Homecoming Weekend, October 1-2, 2021, possibly including the Homecoming football game, luncheon with the UNH president, and our own Saturday evening event. Other classes may do the same thing, so there will be lots of alums on campus. You’ll be hearing more about plans as they develop, but for now, please mark your calendars for Saturday, Oct. 2, 2021, to re-connect with many of our ’65 classmates.\n\n1966\n\nLynda Brearey\n\n791 Harrington Lake Dr N\n\nVenice, FL 34293-4239\n\nlbrearey@gmail.com\n\nWe are pleased to announce the new dates for our upcoming joint 55th Reunion during Homecoming Weekend 2021, Oct. 1-3.

Doris Bens wrote from our hometown of Cheshire, CT, where she and I were also high school classmates, that she has recently retired as an occupational therapist, many of those years spent at Gaylord Rehab. Diane Ledew Dingle of Boxborough, MA, shared family activities during this COVID year. Fortunately, children and grandchildren live close by, except for Adam, who could not return from Prague. Mary Lautzenheiser Wasserman wrote proudly of her son David, who can be seen often as a political analyst on television. We send our condolences to the family of Peter Kelly of Newburyport, MA. Peter majored in business and served as a civilian under the direction of the Portsmouth Shipyard commander. As a Newburyport business leader, Peter served his community in so many volunteer capacities. Also, we salute the service of James Young of Bangor, ME, who received his Ph.D. from UNH. He served in Korea, taught at St Francis College (UNE), hiked the Appalachian Trail, assisted the Maine State Police as a forensic chemist, and in later years volunteered in Thailand to rescue elephants.\n\n1969\n\nSteve Capistran\n\nstevecapistran@gmail.com\n\nWow! What a year. My only COVID-19-related comment is, “Please get vaccinated!” I received mine in January; one of the perks of working in health care. A couple of good notes. I played my last round of golf Dec. 1 at Amherst (NH) Country Club with two fellow alumni, Paul Brassilier and Mark Renaud. Have been doing a lot of urban hiking and snowshoeing when weather permits. I can still be found at the Whitt, Section 117 — well, my one-dimensional cut-out is there. The ROAR Program is worth the donation! Unfortunately, I do have to report on the passing of two members of our class. Stephen E. Merrill died on Sept. 5, 2020. He was the first UNH graduate ever elected governor of N.H. There’s a “memoriam” tribute to him in this issue. Robert A. Carlson III died on Sept. 25 in Panama City, FL. Rob not only distinguished himself as a nuclear engineer for 17 years, but also as a professional tennis player. He played for two years on the pro circuit and later continued his tennis career as a coach at UNH, the Works athletic club in Somersworth, NH, and the Atlanta U.S. Professional Tennis Registry. He was also club pro at the Panama City Frank Brown Park. Our sincere condolences go out to all family members and friends. Stay safe, classmates. I can still be reached at stevecapistran@gmail.com.\n\nJan Harayda\n\n82 Plantation Pointe #280\n\nFairhope, AL 36532\n\nharaydajan@alumni.unh.edu\n\n50th Reunion ◆ June 3-5, 2022\n\nA few months into the pandemic, I quoted a British broadcaster in a letter to friends: “This virus may not have infected my body — but it has certainly infected my mind.” Those words may be true of your life, too. But our 50th reunion will happen! It’s scheduled for June 3–5, 2022, and you’ll find updates on our class Facebook page and in the Reunions section at unh.edu. In the meantime, our class has found ways of staying upbeat during the pandemic. Ann Boulanger wears a blue-and-white mask: “Actually more than one in different shades of blue.” Attorney Bill Clay likes his American flag mask but says: “I need to get a Live Free or Die mask, as that is one of my favorite sayings.” He adds: “Life is good in central Florida, where we live. Doing my court hearings and client meetings by Zoom.” Gary Parker had COVID-19 in December: “Symptoms were fairly mild, received a monoclonal antibody infusion, and am fully recovered.” Gary’s siblings “are scattered from Massachusetts to Texas,” so the family has been doing regular Zoom sessions. Paul Ritzman, who works for Cape Cod Healthcare, got the Pfizer vaccine early: “I just got my second shot and felt lousy for a day. I felt like I had a hangover for a day like the numerous ones I had during my UNH days.” Cindy Brooks is hoping to get a shot soon in Keene: “I had symptoms, found out it was bronchitis, tested COVID neg. I’m grateful and recovering from bronchitis slowly at my home, isolated for such a long time. We can do this!” David Gottesman has tested negative four times and is waiting for New Hampshire to open vaccine-registration for the next eligible group: “300,000 in that group and getting only 18,000 doses a week. Could take a while. Been working remotely for the most part since March.” Thomas Earle Moore also had good test results: “I got nervous about some aches and chills, and since I’m doing daycare for grandchildren I got tested and was negative. Stay safe, everyone!” For Carolyn Innis Remley, the pandemic has been an education: “My daughter and son-in-law are essential workers, so I am the homework helper for my oldest granddaughter. We meet every afternoon online, and we both look forward to it. I am getting a fresh perspective on imperialism, non-rhyming poetry, and the Big Bang. Great fun!” In non-COVID news, class president Bill Gardner announced that he would run for a 23rd two-year term as New Hampshire’s secretary of state. And we are sorry to report the loss of our classmate Linda Ann Grigsby Kisloski in Northhampton, MA. Please search online for her obituary and more about her full and rewarding life.\n\n1971\n\nDebbi Martin Fuller\n\n276 River St.\n\nLangdon, NH 03602\n\nDebbifuller3@gmail.com\n\n50th Reunion ◆ June 3-5, 2022\n\nSo, as you may already know, we decided to postpone our 50th reunion until 2022! This decision will ultimately make our eventual reunion even better because it will include the class of 1970 and 1972! So we’ll get to see ALL of our friends from the year before and the year after! You also have another year to get going on your diets and lose all that COVID weight! I know I’ve eaten a bit too much this year! I heard from Crawford Butler, who retired after 31 years as an income tax preparer. The combination of an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant and the COVID-19 epidemic made it too risky to continue. He enjoyed his clients and his work and will miss both this upcoming tax season. While at UNH, Crawford played trombone with the band SPICE, the house band at the Hampton Beach Casino. Some sad news: James B. Fritz of Southington, CT, died last August after a long battle with progressive supranuclear palsy. He was the executive VP of business development for the Maguire Group for over 40 years. Sylvia E. Gale lost her battle with cancer in July. She was a feminist who worked with many women’s organizations including the NH Commission on the Status of Women, NHDHHS, the Nashua Soup Kitchen and she served in the NH House of Representatives from 2014 to 2014. She was a devoted mother to Elizabeth and leaves behind her life partner, Michael Dollof. She enjoyed outings to Nubble Light, the Keene Pumpkin Festival and good food. She leaves a legacy of fighting for women’s rights and for equality. Beverly Jane O’Brien died in September at a memory care facility in Wisconsin. She worked for the Dover, NH, school system as an elementary school teacher and middle school counselor for 44 years. She had an MA from UNH as well. She was also a member of Dover Adult Education,Vwhere she worked for 29 years. She played the flute and had a lifelong love of Irish music, James Taylor and Jean-Pierre Rampal. Roland (Rollie) Taylor Barnaby passed away in September after a long, courageous battle with Parkinson’s/lewy body dementia. He loved reading, mountain-climbing, summiting all 48 of NH’s 4,000 footers. He was athletic director at Hawthorne College for 10 years, where he also coached basketball and baseball. He built and operated Libby B Seafood Fish Market and Restaurant and he was a Sea Grant Extension Agent at UNH for 20 years as well. He also worked part time as a ski patroller at Cannon and other mountains from 1963 to 2011. David Goodwyn Elmore died in September. He was a standout athlete, making All State in football in high school where he was also captain of the basketball team. He started he own company after UNH, Elmore Sports Sales in Woodbury, CT. After retirement, he moved to Florida and played golf and pickleball. He skied Telluride and snorkeled in the Caribbean. He leaves behind his wife and children and grandchildren. Theodore John Wigger died in October of a complex illness. He entered the family business, Treadway and Wigger Funeral Chapel in Napa, CA, and was an integral part of the Napa community. Ted loved to travel with his friends and relatives. Nansi Boutwell Craig died in October. She lived most of her life in Portsmouth, NH, but she also taught high school phys. ed in Hartford, CT, and then at Biddeford Junior High in Maine. She later moved to San Francisco and worked for AAA insurance. She and her spouse moved back to Portsmouth in 1988 with their son, Mike. She taught in the Marshwood School District until retirement in 2007, after which she worked for the City of Portsmouth Parking Enforcement. She loved sports and played golf, skied and played pickleball. As I write these obituaries, I urge all of you to stay healthy and safe until our 50th reunion!!\n\nJoan Howard ’73 published her book “We Met in Paris,” about the relationship between French novelist Marguerite Youcernar and her translator, Grace Frick, in 2018. After earning her degree in psychology and French at UNH, Howard earned a master’s degree from URI and a doctorate from UConn. She met and spent several summers with Yourcenar, who was the subject of her doctoral dissertation, when she returned to teach at UNH.\n\n1973\n\nJoyce Dube Stephens\n\n33 Spruce Lane\n\nDover, NH 03820\n\njoycedube@comcast.net\n\nFirst, an apology. Our fall column item about class Wildcats who spent their junior year in Dijon, France, incorrectly identified the author of “We Met in Paris: Grace Frick and Her Life with Marguerite Yourcenar.” Joan Howard, the director of Petite Plaisance in Northeast Harbor, ME, published her well-received portrait of these two women in 2018. Our apologies, Joan! Sue Barnes reports that she is a member of the NH Muscle Car Club and showed her car last summer. She retired three years ago after working as a dispatcher. Joyce Dube Stephens, an English education major, started working as one of the first female NH insurance adjusters with The Hartford for four years. Following this, she became an English instructor in the apprenticeship program at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for six years. Next, Joyce worked at Dover Junior High School while in the master’s in reading program at UNH. She then spent nine years in the Barrington (NH) school system, and 18 years at Newmarket Elementary School, from which she retired in 2003. In addition to her work with many students, Joyce mentored beginning teachers and supervised other UNH interns in their reading program. She and her husband, Jay E. Stephens, a civil engineering major, married in Biddeford, ME, and have lived in Dover for almost 48 years. Bill Pelletreau from Norwalk, CT, reported that his hockey teammate Gary Hrushka passed away in Prescott, AZ, last October. We also received word of the deaths of two more of our classmates. Norman Boucher of Nashua, NH, received a master’s in journalism with our class and contributed to such magazines as The Atlantic, The New Republic, The New York Times Magazine, Esquire and Audubon Wilderness. Norman was a newspaper columnist for and wrote “A Bird Lover’s Life List & Journal.” As a young scriptwriter for NHPTV, he wrote the series “The Franco File,” which was awarded a regional Emmy for Best Children’s Program of 1979. For the last 25 years, Norman was the editor and publisher of the Brown University alumni magazine. Jonathan Stearns, Lebanon, NH, volunteered for AmeriCorps VISTA in Indianapolis, IN, before receiving his degree in political science and economics at UNH. Jon enjoyed careers in sales and marketing as well as in human resources. The recipient of several advertising design awards, he worked at the Valley News from 1975-83. Later, he spent 26 years at Concepts NREC, serving in multiple roles, including as director of human resources and with more than a dozen boards and community organizations.\n\n1975\n\nKim Lampson Reiff\n\n7540 SE 71st St.\n\nMercer Island, WA 98040\n\ndrkimlampson@gmail.com\n\nHello 1975 Classmates! I hope you are healthy as we move into a new year. 2020 was full of challenges most of us never thought we would see in our lifetimes. I remember my father, Steve Lampson, a graduate of UNH in the class of 1941, telling me that he was born in the year of the 1918 flu pandemic, but I did not think twice about it. It never occurred to me that one day, I would be living through a pandemic as well. I am grateful to have a job and to have health but know that many have neither. This has been a very challenging year for our country. Please send stories of what you have learned in 2020. Sadly, some of our classmates died during 2020. The graduate students included Philip Carkner (inorganic chemistry), Holly Perrault (literature), and Tom Staples. The undergraduate students included Audrey Banks (nursing), Jon Anger (social work), and Kathi Blaine (microbiology). This is a hard year for celebrating the lives of those who have passed on as gathering together has not been an option, but hopefully, there will be a day in the future when family and friends can assemble and share memories of loved ones. Michael Lanza reports some good news of his farm in North Carolina. He and his wife Indira have 12 goats, 27 hens, 5 roosters, 17 Muscovy ducks and many rabbits. They have an organic garden as well. He is thoroughly enjoying a second career as a farmer. Please send news of your life! It would be so nice to hear from you!\n\n1977\n\nLois Kelly\n\nLkelly@foghound.com\n\nIt’s so fascinating to hear what our classmates have accomplished. Here’s an update from W. Kevin Westgate, a chemical engineering grad who was hired by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company right after graduation: “I worked for Goodyear for 35 years in R&D, becoming the global expert on polymeric-based reinforcements for all tire types (passenger/light truck, aircraft, farm tires). My biggest achievement was discovering and commercially implementing a hybrid cord that not only protects the tire from damage better than any previous version, but also is 1dB quieter. The commercial product is marketed under the name “Silent Armor.” In 2012, I got an opportunity to lead an R&D organization with a spin off company from Goodyear (non-tire rubber products), which was acquired by Continental AG in 2015. Currently, I direct four technical teams: Material Science, Computational Mechanics, Engineering, and full materials laboratory to support the global business needs for six business units. I continue to enjoy being able to explore and bring in new technologies to our company in the areas of sustainability, AI, IoT, sensorics, and enhanced designs/tools/prediction. I’m married with three grown children and three grandkids (with another one on the way!). We’re currently in the middle of building our retirement home and can’t wait to move into it come spring 2021. Looking forward to several more years of balancing life/work before totally engaging into our next stage of life together.” Thanks for the update, Kevin! While many of us are easing into retirement, it’s sad to report others’ obituaries. Rochester, NH, resident Martha Fowler, who majored in English and minored in business administration, died last summer after a brief illness. Martha also earned a master’s degree in library science at Southern Connecticut State University. She worked for many years as a claims representative and operations manager for the Social Security Administration in Lowell, MA. Prior to her death Martha worked at the Rochester Opera House as the business manager overseeing finances, performer contracts, fundraising and other duties to keep the venue running smoothly. Pantelis Damianou died in March 2020 in Cyprus, where he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Cyprus. After graduating UNH, Pantelis earned a master’s degree in mathematics from UCLA and a Ph.D. from the University of Arizona. He leaves his wife Elena and a son Ioannis. Mark Havey, who earned a Ph.D. in physics with our class, died in Virginia Beach, VA. Mark had been an esteemed professor of physics at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, for many years. He is survived by his wife Keitha and daughter Rebecca Haverkos.\n\n1978\n\nCarol Scagnelli Edmonds\n\n75 Wire Rd.\n\nMerrimack, NH 03054\n\nc.edmonds@alumni.unh.edu\n\nMelvin “Rus” Llewellyn Wilson Jr passed away August 2020. He was born in Portsmouth, NH, was educated in the Portsmouth School system, married his high school sweetheart, and worked for the City of Portsmouth as the recreation director and the high school athletic director. His college degrees were earned at the University of Southern Maine, Antioch University and the University of New Hampshire, where he earned a second undergraduate degree in recreation. Rus loved sports and felt that sports encapsulated life lessons and developed character. He also believed that “If you do what you love, you never work a day in your life.” A Rus Wilson Award will be given to a student athlete who embodies hard work, integrity and pride; donations may be sent to Portsmouth High School Athletics. Laura Lee Westlund of Farmington, CT, died in October 2020 after a long illness. Born in Hestra, Sweden, Laura attended West Hartford, public schools. She received her Juris Doctor degree from the UNH Franklin Pierce Law Center. She was in the Division of Public Defender Services for the State of CT as Senior Assistant Public Defender. Laura had a strong commitment to serving the poor, homeless, unemployed and those unable to stand up for themselves. She was an avid reader, a wonderful cook and an ardent gardener; she never met a plant she didn’t like, and all plants flourished with her green thumbs. Laura will be remembered for her patience, humor, resiliency and grace in all facets of her life. A memorial gathering will be planned for spring 2021.\n\nThe class of 1980 mourns the passing of Bob Maxwell, who died last July. A sociology major, he leaves behind his wife of 39 years, Lynne Hasting ’80, four children and one grandchild.\n\nJackie Lacroix ’75 and Richard Whitney ’80 checked out a farm with a familiar name — no relation, however — during a biking adventure with Caryl Dow ’80 and Duffy Morong ’76.\n\nCaryl Dow ’80 and Duffy Morong ’76 also stopped for a photo (and a picnic!) at Whitney’s Farm Stand following a speedy descent of Mt.

We all hope a very different 2021 will move us away from this pandemic. With so many of us stuck in the house these days, Gary Kraznov wrote he has clipped his wings after 35 years with Delta Air Lines and retired as a 777 captain. He still works for RAA, an investment company specializing in airline pilots as V.P. of airline strategy and compliance. Gary also reports he is happily married to his bride of 37 years, Karen. This fall I enjoyed my first visit to the Berkshires with three of my fellow Wildcats. Traveling in RV’s, we brought bicycles and sat by a cozy fire keeping to physical distancing. Richard Whitney ’83 and Jackie Lacroix ’75 met in Stoke Hall laundry their first night as freshmen! Richard was called away by the US Navy and returned to Durham to graduate eight years later, after which he and Jackie married. Duffy Morong ’76 and I enjoyed a rather quick descent of Mt. Greylock on bikes, with the Whitneys ready to pick up pieces had there been any. We enjoyed laughs and a picnic at Whitney’s Farm situated along the lakeside bike path — no relation, apparently. I have more good news to report in forthcoming issues – thanks for sharing. Martin J. Bergeron, 62, of South Bend, IN, passed away on Aug. 25, 2020, after a brief illness. He grew up in Hudson, NH, and attended Keene State College before transferring to UNH to earn his BA in theatre. Martin held a variety of jobs, including childcare specialist for Wang Corporation which he enjoyed most of all. Later earning his teaching certificate from Western Michigan University, he worked at Penn Harris Madison School and Wilson Elementary for 22 years. A kind and compassionate teacher, he believed in developing not only students’ academic abilities, but also their emotional well-being, sense of community, and empathy towards each other, and often asked that children with the most difficult issues be placed in his classroom. We received an update to the notice of Robert “Bob” E. Maxwell’s death from Bob’s wife Lynne Hastings ’80. Bob passed away July 13, leaving his wife of 39 years and four children: daughters Kim Maxwell Proulx and Courtney Maxwell Burke ‘06, sons Ryan and Nathan, and a granddaughter, Lexi Proulx. After earning his bachelor’s degree in sociology, Bob enjoyed a long career in retail management, including 23 years as a K-Mart manager and more recently Verizon. The Maxwells lived in North Attleboro, MA, for the last 27 years.

This year, we celebrate 40 years since our UNH graduation! While Reunions are traditionally held in June, the planning committee has decided, due to the pandemic, to schedule our gathering to coincide with Homecoming on Oct. 1-3, 2021. We will share the festivities with the Class of 1980. So far, Denise Boisselle Day, Roger Duke, Bob Coates and I have agreed to serve on the planning committee. We invite you to join us — and promise it won’t be a lot of work. You can join the committee by contacting Corena Garnas, Associate Director of Alumni Engagement, Reunions at corena.garnas@unh.edu. Corena will be happy to provide current contact information for classmates. I know that the more people involved in the planning, the better the Reunion. While there are many ways to help, the single most important responsibility is to reach out to your friends and encourage them to attend. Makes sense, if your friends are with you — you’ll have a great time. So, mark your calendar for October 1-3 and plan to be in Durham. You can begin your trip down memory lane by taking a peek at our 1981 Granite. Also, join our Facebook page to reconnect with friends and to stay up to date on Reunion plans: https://www.facebook.com/groups/UNH1981/. You can also find Reunion information at www.unh.edu/reunions. David MacDowell retired in 2016 after working for 35 years for BP.

They have four children and four granddaughters; their son David James died in 1991. David and Beth enjoyed a quick trip to UNH in October and were impressed by the campus changes and the students “all masked up” due to COVID-19. They also enjoyed a couple of Newick’s lobsters in an almost-empty dining room. Denise Boisselle Day and her husband Tim Day have lived in Durham since 1995. Denise works as a family advocate for Strafford County Head Start and is serving her third three-year term as a school board member for the Oyster River Cooperative School District.

He and his wife have three children in college who have kept both Tom and Lisa busy with their many hockey games over the years. Gary Michael Alafat passed away in July 2020. Gary was a lifelong resident of New Hampshire and spent his younger years across the state in Lebanon before attending UNH. After graduation, he backpacked across Europe and then returned to work for many years at his family’s restaurant. His friends and family will miss his overwhelming enthusiasm for life and the special love he had for family.\n\n1983\n\nIlene Segal, DVM\n\n245 Warren Drive\n\nNorfolk, MA 02056\n\nihsdvm6@gmail.com\n\nPaul Joseph Morin passed away Sept. 20, 2020.

He was affiliated with the NH Home Builders Association and advocated for home ownership and safe practices for the builder and consumer community. He helped craft legislation to adopt a statewide building code, workforce housing initiatives, and the ability to have accessory dwelling units constructed through the state. He was the Chair of the town of Weare Planning Board from 2001 to 2009 and held positions on numerous state commissions and task forces. Paul was the first residential contractor to be awarded the NH Construction Industry Ethics Award. He leaves his wife Patricia and his stepchildren and will be remembered most for the love of his family. Celia Koester Osborne passed away Oct. 6. She attended Buffalo State College and continued her education at UNH, where she received her master’s degree in education. She was a dedicated special needs teacher in public school systems for many years. She also founded her own boat- building school and was a certified yoga instructor. She developed Movement Based Learning, a company that created means, methods, and an international network for teaching people with special needs, as well as authoring several books and manuals to promote this program all over the world. She will be remembered as a remarkable teacher, a gifted author, and a compassionate mentor. Timothy J. Dubuque passed away Oct. 10. After receiving received his bachelor’s degree in occupational therapy from UNH he earned a master’s degree in computers and education from Lesley University. He worked for many years at Great Bay Community College.

Donations in his memory to the NH SPCA or NH Fish and Game are welcome.\n\n1984\n\nRobin Peters Schell\n\n5 Ashley Drive\n\nAmesbury, MA 01913\n\nrschell@jjwpr.com\n\nHappy 2021! May it bring happiness and good health to all my UNH Wildcat friends.\n\nFirst, a shout-out to my friend Elaine Messier Walczak for connecting me to some of her friends for this update: Terri Searl DeConte writes that she began her retail career at Jordan Marsh and later worked for Laura Ashley. Though the corporate headquarters were in Boston, she enjoyed frequent travel to London where the design team was based. For the past 25 years, she has been working for J.Jill and currently serves as VP of Creative Merchandising. Terri and her husband Gerard live on Cape Cod with their 15-year-old daughter, Kira. She recalls: “My a cappella singing days with the NH Notables were among some of my favorites at UNH. Now my singing days are in the car with Kira and her friends!” I also heard from Judy Elwell Matulis, who lives in south Florida with Michael, her husband of 33 years (who is also her small business partner). They have four boys; Stephen, Chris, Michael and Matthew; and one granddaughter, Arya. Through the years, they have enjoyed following the sports careers of their boys; their son Chris pitched for LSU and UCF while son Mike played football for the USC Gamecocks. Their son Matthew ’20 played football for Coach Mac and graduated in 2020 with a degree in business administration. Judy loved coming back to the Durham campus to see all the changes, and to catch up with UNH alums including Joan Cameron Gordon, Elaine Messier Walczak and Sandy Curtis ’85. I reached out to Kim Brown-Champoux for an update. She has been married to classmate Michael Champoux for 35 years this September. They have four adult children; two sons are local, and the other son lives in NYC. Their daughter married a Marine and lives at the US Embassy in San Salvador. Kim has been retired (kindergarten teacher) from the Londonderry School District for the past four years and enjoys spending time outdoors, playing tennis and golf or hiking and biking. Michael is working for SalesForce. In non-COVID times, Kim volunteers at the MFA in Boston and the Palace Theatre in Manchester. She stays in touch with fellow Wildcats Wendy Fluet Gual, Terri Kanaskie Sollitto, Cindy Mangene McKee and Deb Henderson Graziani. If you’re housebound due to COVID-19 protocols and need something to do, write, call or text me with your news!\n\nJohn Marshall ’87 never imagined he’d be an orphan advocate. He was a TV producer, author and popular Instagram artist known as Sunset Selfies. But after a long career in the television industry, with nine Emmy awards to his credit, Marshall switched gears and launched Teach Her, a service organization that offers college education to orphaned girls. “I’ve lived at an Indian orphanage for seven months in each of the last six years,” Marshall says, “and I’ve seen how critical education is for these kids, especially the girls. Without training or support, they are some of the most vulnerable members of our human family. But with support, they are full of potential.” There are currently more than four million girls living in orphanages worldwide and these students are Teach Her’s focus. With extremely affordable educational opportunities in developing countries, Marshall hopes to get lots of people involved and work to change the future one student at a time. He invites all UNH alumni and current students to visit www.teachher.org to meet the girls and get involved.\n\n1985\n\nJulie Colligan Spak\n\n116 Longfields Way\n\nDowningtown, PA 19335-4486\n\njuliecspak@gmail.com\n\nHello, everyone!

UNH Wildcats are known for their sense of adventure, resourcefulness and can-do attitudes, so please drop me an email and share what’s new on your end! My family spent/spends lots of time hiking and biking and getting back to nature is bliss!

The Alumni Center sent word that John Powell, who received both a bachelor’s in electrical engineering and a law degree from UNH has joined the law firm Sunstein LLP as a partner in the firm’s patent practice group. Previously, John was a partner in the Boston law firm Verrill Dana, LLP. Sunstein LLP managing partner Kerry L. Timbers shared, “We are thrilled to have John join our firm.

I hope this finds everyone healthy and keeping busy. I was pleased to hear from one of my journalism classmates, Joy Burke Dustin. Joy recently published her first book, a contemporary young adult novel called “Fred and Ginger are Learning to Dance.” (Congratulations!) She also recently celebrated 25 years as a high school English teacher and, despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, still enjoys every minute of it. Joy lives in Concord with her husband, three children and a new Labradoodle puppy. I also heard from Jane LaBombard, who lives in Glens Falls, NY, and works as a water resources manager for a renewable energy company. She’s also been a part-time gymnastics coach for the past 18 years. When she’s not working or coaching, Jane enjoys participating in snowshoe races in the Adirondacks. She is looking forward to visiting her nieces and nephews in New York City and Los Angeles once traveling becomes safe again. Meanwhile, Rachel Podradchik Leber, who lives in New Jersey just outside NYC, left a successful career in the sports and entertainment industry in 2020 to start her own business. She works on the client-side of building licensing programs for global consumer products companies. Her business provides senior-level resources to companies that don’t have a need for full-time staff but want to create incremental sales through brand activations. This service, she reports, has been positive for clients that are working to keep their businesses moving forward during the pandemic. Rachel is also focused on supporting women-led companies as a means of empowering the next generation of women business leaders. As for me, I recently achieved my master’s degree in library and information science from San Jose State University and celebrated nine years working at EBSCO, a vendor of library databases and software-as-a-service.
