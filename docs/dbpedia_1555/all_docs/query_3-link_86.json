Fellow members of the band Queen, along with singer Phil Collins and a full orchestra will then join in from a plastic stage in the palace gardens below. The roof-top vantage point was chosen to provide a dramatic start to the open-air concert, which takes place on 3 June.\n\nThe event will be screened live by the BBC and broadcast around the world.\n\nIn Germany for example RTL 2 will cover the whole show live in their programme.\n\nOrganisers of the £4m extravaganza had been searching for an unusual way of performing God Save the Queen. \"We wanted to make it spectacular,\" a Jubilee spokesman said. \"This achieves that aim.\"\n\nWhen Queen's performance is finished, comedian Lenny Henry will introduce Latino singer Ricky Martin, who will entertain the crowds with his number one hit Livin' La Vida Loca. In addition to celebrating the Queen's 50 years of rule, the concert also salutes the life of the late George Harrison. Sir Paul McCartney and guitarist Eric Clapton will perform Harrison's Here Comes the Sun.\n\nThe Queen wants the Jubilee concert to appeal to all ages. Other performers on the bill include Ozzy Osbourne, Canadian singer Brian Adams and Pop Idol winner Will Young. \"Trying to appeal to all ages is the basic thing behind it all,\" the spokesman said. \"This is a celebration for everybody.\" The concert's grand finale will be a rendition of the Beatles' All You Need Is Love, led by Sir Paul McCartney.\n\nBrian and Roger will play live together and will perform the following songs:\n\nRadio Ga Ga, Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You and We are the Champions.\n\nStarting time for \"Queen\"´s live appearance is 20:30h (London time).\n\nTuesday, April 30th 2002\n\nBrian and Roger (\"Queen\") live in Amsterdam\n\n(source: brianmayworld.com)\n\nBrian and Roger played a short live concert today - a unique show on Hollands National Queensday.\n\nMany other bands also played at the same stage troughout the whole day.\n\nQueens performance took place at the Museumplein in Amsterdam at 15:00h.\n\nGuest drummer was Eric Singer, guest backing vocalists were the Fabba Girls Susie Webb and Zoe Nicholas.

He says:\n\n\"Yes, I put a few brush strokes on two tracks for the forthcoming Foos Album, in beautiful Conway Studios in L.A.\n\nI'm not sure if they want me to divulge the titles - but one track is very aggressively rhythmic, and I contributed some \"Get Down Make Love\" - type guiar as well as some soloing.\n\n(The old machine which I invented and had custom -made for doing the solo on GD ML live in Queen shows is still around - but the vintage harmoniser which it controlled has disappeared, so I can't use it any\n\nFor this session we improvised with more modern equipment to get a similar effect - in fact slightly different - so it was inspiring and seems to work well with the track.\n\nOf course it was all experimental and I did it purely because it was fun to work with my great pals - the whole group was there plus Gus, their excellent tour Manager.\n\nThey can use it if in the cold light of day the group (or Dave!) think it works!\n\nThe other track is totally unusual - a kind of narrative ballad - very daring in its simplicity - I contributed some Queen II lush harmony guitar sound figures.\n\nTaylor and Dave are familiar with everything Queen ever did - and as soon as I turned the AC 30 up full, wound off the treble, and fed my guitar into it with all pickups in phase, feeding back, sustaining like a cello, Taylor said - \"Ha ! the White Queen sound!!!\" He was spot on of course - haven't used that sound in probably 15 years.....\n\nWe had fun ! And the gardens of this particular studio are beautiful - very inspiring - an OASIS ! And the sun shone warmly, and I didn't want to come home to cold depressing England!\n\nThursday, January 24th 2002\n\nWe will rock you musical - details\n\n(source: queenonline/www.brianmayworld.com)\n\nSpike Edney, Jamie Moses and Neil Murray (all members of the Brian May Band) are providing the music for the musical.\n\nThe musical will open on May 14th at London´s West End (Dominion Theatre). It is the same venue as Freddie´s appearance in the gala show of the \"Time\" musical back into the 80s.\n\nThe public sale will start on February 1st.\n\nSaturday, January 5th 2002\n\nExtract transcription from Total Guitar, January 2002  Featuring Brian May; interviewed by Scott Rowley\n\n(source: Total Guitar)\n\nSo, youre from Total Air Guitar are you? Brian May has lost it. Months of thinking about the wonderful world of air guitar has finally got to him. As you may already be aware, the former Queen guitarist is the man behind The Best Air Guitar Album In The World...Ever!, a double-CD collection of top riffs and widdlesome solos designed to get you out yer seat, hands tickling an imaginary fretboard before you can say Hi Ho Silver Lining.\n\nBut hang on: isnt this air guitar malarkey taking the piss out of our great guitar heroes? Well, I think imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, says Brian.\n\nBut I also think it [air guitar] is something more basic that that, Ive had lots of time to think about it during the last few months, and I think its a basic primal need.\n\nI dont think people even choose to do it, it just creeps up on them and they have to do it.\n\nI suppose you quite often find yourself describing a riff to someone and your hands are doing the talking... Thats right. I dont think any of us could actually give it up any more than we could stop breathing, really.\n\nInspired by an internet poll where people voted for their fave air guitar tracks and Queen were number one with Bohemian Rhapsody, Mays guitar tech, Pete Malandrond, remarked that the selection would make for a great album, I thought, Well, yeah. And the strange thing was that if we were going to make the best air guitar album in the world ever, it would mean putting together the finest guitar music ever made.\n\nGetting technical help from World Air Guitar Champion Zac Monro, Brian also used his personal contacts to get some artists that dont normally allow their music to be used on compilations: he mightve missed out on AC/DC and the Sex Pistols, but Jimi Hendrix and Metallica are a nice consolation.\n\nSo what were the criteria for a song to qualify? The number one criterion was that if you hear the song you have to jump up and do something, explains Brian. Preferably in the first 10 seconds. But not necessarily: there are some creepers in there. With Freebird you have to kinda wait for your moment and then youre up there. The second criterion in my mind was that it would be nice if these moments were getting through to people on the other level of being the greatest moments in the creation of guitar riffs. The two are actually linked, because those great moments when someone discovers a great new riff are very akin to the moment where you feel you have to jump up and air guitar to that riff. There is a kind of direct link between the riff player and the air guitarist, I feel.\n\ntranscribed by Susannah.Davy\n\n-thanks a lot!-\n\nWednesday, January 2nd 2002\n\nBrian back in the studio\n\n(source: Queenonline)\n\nBrian May is going back into the studio in the New Year with popular composer Michael Kamen to contibute to the Official Winter Olympics 2002 theme tune.\n\nThe 2002 Winter Olympics run between Febuary 8th and 24th in Salt Lake, USA.\n\nSunday, November 25th 2001\n\nBrian and Roger live - November 24th, 2001 - London\n\n(source:brianmayworld.com)\n\nBrian and Roger went on stage yesterday and performed a couple of songs live together with the SAS Band.\n\nThey perfomed the following songs:\n\n\"Radio Ga Ga\" (vocals by Roger)\n\n\"Since you've been gone\" (Brian)\n\n\"Tie your mother down\" (Brian)\n\n\"Strange Frontier\" (Roger)\n\n\"Under Pressure\" (Roger & Treana Morris)\n\n\"No one but you\" (Brian and Roger - 1st time live together)\n\nA report of the show can be found here\n\nThursday, October 11th 2001\n\nBrian May talks...(Cambridge Union, October 9th)\n\n(source: Edward Haworth)\n\na report by Edward Haworth:\n\nI was lucky enough to attend a talk that Brian May gave at the Cambridge Union earlier tonight (October 9th, 2001). It was a great priviledge to finally 'meet' the man himself. And whilst it makes me feel vaguely like a spy typing this, he said some things I am sure you are all itnerested in.\n\nHe opened his talk with a speech against the bombing of Afghanistan and played Bob Dylan's \"With God on Our Side\" on acoustic - a great song and very played. I was suprised by how political he could be, on this issue and on animal rights he put forward a very persuasive, non dogmatic and understated argument.\n\nHe closed by playing \"We Will Rock You\" on his red special and the Deacy amp (!), which we got to isnpect (and even touch) later. He mentioned that he came to Cambridge for an interview in his time and talked briefly about his life (mostly academic) before Queen.\n\nThe rest oif his talk was given to questions. The songs he are most proud of are \"Too much love...\" (the playing of which at the tribute concert is his fondest live performance) and \"We will rock you\" and his favourite album is \"Queen 2\" (and although he criticised The Works and Hot Space he said he basically stood by them). On the subject of albumst he wished people had the chance to listen to the studio albums rather then the greatest hits releases. The song he would like most of all to have written is Lennon's \"Jealous Guy\". He refused to go into much detail when asked about the biggest bender Queen went on, but mentioned female mud wrestlers and the infamous New Orleans party. He defended John against someoneone who asked if he had any real input into the band \"he wrote our best selling single...\" (another one bites..). He mentioned Freddie many times, and how he still misses him, but he said he was finally comfortable talking\n\nabout him again - mostly.\n\nIn terms of the future he said he planned to record another solo album \"when he had something to say again\". The Queen musical (no longer directly about them) and a rock show/planetarium opening in Munich are projects he is very pumped about. Also he mentioned the entire \"Night at the opera\" album is being remixed into Dolby 5.1 (presumably DVD audio) by the original producer - the first time he said anyone has been allowed to mess with the original recording of BohRap. This sounds fantastic and will be first heard at the Munich planetarium opening. He spoke very enthusiastically about his positive relationship with Roger, he said they ahd hoped to do more work with Robbie Williams, but was dissapointed that this no longer looked likely. Unfortunately he said both Roger and himself have very little contact with John anymore, who had moved on. When I asked him later if he thought Queen would ever work together on new material he said he thought it was very unlikely - that that moment had passed and that future collaboration between Roger and himself would carry on with the musical and other projects as the closest thing to any new Queen work. When I asked him if then Smile would ever reform he just laughed.\n\nHopefully some of the above will be interesting - it was a fantastic evening - the man is amazing, the most unlikely rock star ever.\n\nThursday, October 11th 2001\n\nQueen DVD releases\n\n(source: Queenonline.com)\n\nVarious plans are afoot for the release of Queen DVD's for next year. The first of these will be the release of the Freddie Mercury tribute concert on DVD with special backstage footage and rehearsal footage, scheduled for April 2002.\n\nThursday, September 27th 2001\n\nMore details about Brian and Roger in Germany - December 2001\n\n(source: Munich Planetarium/brianmayworld.com)\n\nI haved been told that the lasershow will last for about 60 minutes.

The exclusive show will be presented on the 20 meter high dome in 360°.\n\nThe premiere will be in December 2001 - and the show will be performed daily.\n\nbrianmayworld.com will keep you updated about further details (how to obtain tickets, etc...)\n\nWednesday, September 26th 2001\n\nBrian and Roger in Germany in December 2001\n\n(source: Queenonline.com)\n\nBrian and Roger will be special guests in Munich this December.

So far the only announcement for features include THX, DTS 6.1, Dolby EX.\n\nOf great interest is that they confirmed they will be looking into adding Queen music videos to the DVD which would most likely be \"Princes of the Universe\"\n\nand \"A Kind of Magic\".\n\nSaturday, September 22th 2001\n\nBrian May interview and new CD in magazine\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club)\n\nBrian has done an interview for Guitarist Magazine, the issue is due out on October 4th 2001.

Boasting a newly restored film transfer, the DVD and VHS feature 22 hit songs, including \"We Will Rock You,\" \"Somebody To Love,\" \"Under Pressure,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" and \"We Are The Champions,\" among others. Formed in 1972, Queen has retained a fanatical following around the world. Led by the theatrical lead singer, Freddie Mercury, Queen also consisted of Brian May on guitar, Roger Taylor on drums and John Deacon on bass. Since the 1970's, Queen has recorded over 19 albums and has played together for over 20 years. Queen hits \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are The Champions\" have become recognizable international anthems for all sports events. On November 24, 1991, Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. This year Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nDigitally re-mastered with THX certification, the Queen We Will Rock You DVD will be anamorphic and contain a photo gallery, discography, motion menus and an audio commentary by producer and director Saul Swimmer. In addition, the DVD features a trivia game, band biography and timeline, new packaging and Easter Eggs. The Queen We Will Rock You DVD is available in Dolby DTS Digital Surround for $29.98 and in Dolby Digital 5.1 for $24.98.\"\n\nSaturday, September 15th 2001\n\nDetails about the Queen musical\n\n(source: playbill.com)\n\nActor Sam Kane has revealed details of the hotly anticipated Queen musical, following his audition for the show.\n\nIn a recent interview with Teletext, the news and information service, actor Sam Kane revealed details of We Will Rock You, expected at the West End's\n\nDominion Theatre next year (www.brianmayworld.com: it should open around May 2002).\n\nSam Kane auditioned for a part in the new show and revealed, \"It's all the musicfrom Queen and set in the future: good versus evil. It sounds like it's going to be\n\nsensational. The only analogy I can draw is Mamma Mia!. They've got their storyline but used the songs from ABBA, not a story about ABBA. This is\n\nsimilar, very dramatic.\"\n\nApparently the character he auditioned for is sidekick to a wicked queen. Kane says, \"They've got an evil queen who hates rock music. And the queen's\n\nsidekick has got to go around and do the queen's work by banishing rock music and anyone who listens to it or plays it, but he secretly loves it\n\nhimself and has quite a nasty streak in him and is setting the whole thing up, so he can take over and rule the world himself. He's a devilish, bad, nasty character, so\n\nit's great.\"\n\nSam Kane is probably most recognizable from his role as 'Peter Phelan,' the philandering hairdresser in Brookside, in which he featured over two\n\nyears. Most recently he made a return to musicals, heading the cast of Carousel alongside Darren Day in the National tour.\n\nKane further revealed that rehearsals for We Will Rock You are scheduled for February 2002, with an expected opening date in May. The musical has\n\nbeen written by Ben Elton and will be directed by Christopher Renshaw, who most recently directed The King and I, with choreography by Arlene Phillips.\n\nThursday, August 16th 2001\n\nQueen concert postponed\n\n(source: Official Queen Fan Club Website)\n\nThe Queen concert in New York (VH1 Storytellers) has been postponed until later in the year.\n\nMore information will follow as soon as I get them.\n\nWednesday, July 26th 2001\n\nFull Queen concert live in New York\n\n(source: Official Queen Fan Club Website)\n\nthe following was posted today and is straight from the Official Queen Fan Club website:\n\nAs it's now \"public knowledge\":\n\nQueen are joining forces with Foo Fighters dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins to host the Storytellers live gig on September 9th at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. It will be for an audience of approximately 1500. At present I have no idea of how or when tickets will be available. It could be \"invite only\", they could be on sale, they could be free on a first come first served basis, once I find out I will let you know. I have requested an amount of tickets for UK and European fans who might want to attend, but haven't been given any indication of whether we will get them yet. There will be about five guest vocalists, including Dave and Taylor, but the others as yet unconfirmed. The show will be filmed by VH1 and aired across North America, it will also eventually be available on DVD worldwide.\n\nWednesday, July 18th 2001\n\nNew \"We will rock you\" DVD release\n\n(source: www.amazon.com)\n\nOn 18th September Queen´s live concert in Montreal from 1981 will be re-released on DVD.\n\nA Dolby Digital 5.1 and a DTS version will be released.\n\nFeatures: Audio commentray with the band and a discography.\n\nMonday, June 25th 2001\n\nBrian May on new Robbie Williams single\n\n(source: EMI Germany/Martin Weinberger at the Brian May list)\n\nAccording to EMI Germany Brian May is featured on Robbie´s new single \"Eternity\"\n\nEMI Germany sent out a promotional 5\"CD with an insert which says: \"You can hear Brian May as guest guitarist\".\n\n'Eternity' hit the radio stations last week, and will be released on July 9th.

Uh, make that a *member* of the band Queen for a day.\n\nAnd the English pop phenom may well be spending more days with Queen. Discussions have taken place about his singing for a tour, while several other projects are also in the planning stages for what in the next year or two could be the first ongoing activity for the band since the 1991 AIDS-related death of singer and showman Freddie Mercury.\n\nFor this occasion at Universal, Brian May and Roger Taylor, founding members of Queen, asked Williams to take Mercury's slot for a video of \"We Are The Champions,\" a Queen classic that's being used in the jousting movie \"A Knight's Tale.\" And with May and Taylor unable to participate in the video due to logistics, it was all the hammy Williams' show as director Evan Bernard pieced together the staging and surroundings of a rock concert set in medieval times - think \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" meets \"This Is Spinal Tap.\"\n\n\"I never said we were better than the king,\" Williams said, John Lennon-like, in answer to a question posed in a press conference scene staged for the video. \"I merely said we were more popular.\"\n\nBut for all the silliness, there's serious business at hand for Queen, with \"We Are The Champions,\" \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Another One Bites The Dust\" among the highest-profile classic-rock songs, a continual prescence not just on radio but also in movies, commercials and at sports events. At the center of the new activity is a proposed concert tour with Williams joining guitarist May and bassist Taylor (sic), a venture rumored but denied several months ago.\n\n\"They actually wanted to do shows in the States and Japan (this year),\" Williams said in between video takes. \"They came to a couple of shows of mine last year and chatted with me about it, which was amazing. But it would entail an awful lot of stuff. I need some time off first.\"\n\nMay, speaking by phone from his home in England, confirmed that the gears are turning on several Queen projects, including the tour, a VH1 special and even the possibility of new music. There's also a long-discussed musical using Queen songs in development, with tentative plans to open in London in Spring 2002.\n\n\"This (song for the movie) is a new step, really,\" May said, noting that Queen drummer John Deacon (sic) has opted to stay on the sidelines at this point. \"We haven't let anyone else sing the songs with us, but we think Robbie's pretty special. We've had various informal discussions about doing more, with the upshot being that we'll go slowly.\"\n\nThe proposed VH1 special would be similar to a recent Doors show that featured guest singers in place of the late Jim Morrison. Among those expected to be part of Queen's show are Williams and Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl, who joined May and Taylor for a rousing \"Tie Your Mother Down\" at the recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\n\nFor Williams, the gig could prove the door to recognition in the U.S. In the U.K., Europe and Asia, the singer is one of the biggest pop stars of recent years. Over here, though, he's still largely unknown.\n\nFor May, just talking about doing these projects is a personal breakthrough.\n\n\"All of this wouldn't have happened a year ago, mostly because of me,\" May says. \"I've been concerned about being Brian May and not Queen. It was something I had to get over - part of the grieving process. I felt it was painful to operate under the Queen banner. But it's easy to operate with Roger now.\"\n\nSaturday, April 14th 2001\n\nNew song by Queen on Linda McCartney compiliation\n\n(source: QMS)\n\nQueen, Madonna, Britney Spears, Lenny Kravitz, Art Garfunkel, possibly 3/4 of The Beatles and The Corrs are among stars recording\n\nBeatles songs for an album tribute to Linda McCartney.\n\nMembers of Queen are expected to perform Paul's solo track Souvenir.\n\nThe double CD is expected to raise millions for the charity Women And Cancer. Linda died from the disease in 1998.\n\nThe response from the big stars has been amazing. About 12 tracks are in the bag.\n\nMadonna is still making up her mind over which song to cover while The Corrs are recording The Long And Winding Road.\n\nThe project is likely to be backed up by a TV special.

For a while, a tour this year has been rumored, with British pop singer Robbie Williams taking over Mercury's role on vocals. It seems to make a weird sort of sense: Williams landed a British hit with \"Let Me Entertain You,\" a sentiment the flamboyant Mercury certainly lived by.\n\n\"If ... we could make good music, and some of those Queen songs could be aired in a situation where you're still growing, then I would welcome that.\"  Brian May\n\n\"The absolute truth of the matter is, we talk about this kind of stuff all the time,\" May said about the Williams rumors, as well as speculation about landing George Michael or Elton John as an ad hoc singer.\n\n\"We've had a couple of talks with Robbie, and we know him really well, and we like him. But it hasn't gone any further than that at the moment. We all need to do a bit of thinking before a decision like that would be made.\"\n\nWhile May clearly is itching to play Queen songs again, he's loath to tour with Deacon and Taylor sans Mercury.\n\n\"I always thought that I don't want to replace Freddie,\" he said. \"That's out of the question. But if ... we could make good music, and some of those Queen songs could be aired in a situation where you're still growing, then I would welcome that. It would be nice to be out there and play to people again. I miss that ... a lot.\"\n\nIt's been a few years since May's most recent solo album, 1998's Another World, but last year he popped up on other people's records twice. He played on Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi's star-studded solo debut, Iommi. Queen fans will remember that May and Iommi have worked together before; the Sabbath riff-lord was in the backing band at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert in 1992, and they both played on a cover of Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the Water\" in 1989.\n\n\"You meet a lot of acquaintances in the music industry, but very few true friends,\" May said. \"Tony is a true friend, a great guy.\"\n\nMay also played on another, slightly more bizarre, track in 2000: the Foo Fighters' cover of Pink Floyd's \"Have a Cigar.\" Foo frontman Dave Grohl played drums on the track, and drummer Taylor Hawkins, a friend of May for years, took the mic. (It's available on the MI:2 soundtrack). \"I think you naturally gravitate to people who you respect and like,\" May said of the Foos. \"I admire their stuff very much.\"\n\nWe may hear more May this year; he spent some time in the studio with Axl Rose, laying down solos for the long-awaited Guns 'N Roses album.\n\n\"It sounds great, and Axl sounds wonderful,\" May said, noting that his contributions are not guaranteed to make that album, to be titled Chinese Democracy.\n\nAlso last year, May marked two milestones: He got married, and soon after, he received word that Queen  a band that was on the receiving end of several critical slams in its day  would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The ceremony takes place Monday.\n\n\"It feels excellent, everyone's been congratulating me,\" May said. \"[But between the marriage and the Hall of Fame], I've been confused as to what people are congratulating me for!\"\n\nSome rock and roll legends have been less than enthusiastic about the Hall of Fame. Black Sabbath leader Ozzy Osbourne has been downright disdainful, and Queen's \"Under Pressure\" duet partner, David Bowie, didn't even bother to attend his induction. But May  who will attend the March 19 induction ceremony with the rest of the surviving members of his band  couldn't be happier.\n\n\"I know I'm gonna be happy to get this award,\" May said, adding, \"I'm gonna be happy to perform at the ceremony.\" That is sure to excite Queen fans, who will have the opportunity to watch an edited version of the induction ceremony on VH1 at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nWhile May lamented that his friend Iommi won't be getting in the Hall  \"I would think that because of [Sabbath's] huge influence, they would have to be inducted!\"  he looks forward to seeing his old pals in Aerosmith, who will be getting in that night, and he's hoping for a jam session: \"I think we should get together with Aerosmith.\"\n\nStill, he said he feels a tinge of jealousy that, while Aerosmith will be celebrating their induction at the same time they're plugging a brand-new album, Queen's recording days are over. But with the surviving Queen members mulling some sort of semi-reunion, May hopes to add an epilogue to the grand story that was Queen.\n\n\"For a while I used to say, 'OK, I don't want to be a part of Queen anymore, I want to be myself.' I was a bit vociferous about it for a while. And I think that I had to do that as part of my growth. And as part of my grieving about Freddie.\n\n\"Now, I think we've all grown up,\" he continued, \"and we realize, 'OK, Queen is with us forever.' And it's fitting that it should be, because we worked a large percentage of our lives to make that thing. So I feel comfortable with looking at Queen things, and being part of what we made all those years.\"\n\nFriday, March 16th 2001\n\nMore information about Queen at the Hall Of Fame\n\n(source:BBC Online)\n\nBritish rock group Queen have described their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - which takes place next week - as a \"high honour\".\n\nGuitarist Brian May told BBC News Online that he was \"very, very happy\" at the award, which is given to artists who have had a\n\n\"significant impact\" on rock 'n' roll.\n\nThe ceremony comes 10 years after the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury. Asked what he though Mercury would make of the accolade, May\n\nsaid: \"Freddie would go, 'Oh wonderful.'\"\n\nThe remaining members of Queen - Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon - will perform their anthem We Will Rock You at the annual\n\nceremony, which takes place at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

Ben Elton has written us a fantastic script.\"\n\nIt was originally planned to be biographical and tell the story of one of the biggest bands to come out of the UK in the late 1970s and the tragic loss of their lead singer, Freddie Mercury, to an AIDS related illness in 1991.\n\nMay commented: \"We've actually been working on this damn musical for about four years and been through various ideas, some of which were biographical, which in the end we didn't want to do.\n\n\"But now Ben came up with this great idea, so we've been workshopping it privately and possibly by the end of this year or the beginning of next year we hope it'll be on in the West End.\n\nDespite his excitement about the project neither May, nor the other remaining members of Queen - Roger Taylor and John Deacon - will in the performance.\n\nMay explained: \"Young people will be in it. There'll be a lot of Queen songs with some new ideas in there.\"\n\nElton had already scored a successful musical, having collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber on 'The Beautiful Game'.\n\nMay's interview on Capital Gold is scheduled for broadcast on March 15th.\n\nWednesday, March 8th 2001\n\nQueen live on stage in New York - with guest artists\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club magazine, issue: spring 2001)\n\nQueen will also be working with VH1 to make one of their excellent \"Story Tellers\" series. VH1 have done these with Sting, Eric Clapton and Bowie amongst others, and the idea is that the artists talk about their songs, how they were written, why, what they mean, etc, and then perform them.\n\nIt will be recorded live in front of an invited audience in New York in the Spring.\n\nThe show will be broadcatsed by VH1 but will also be released as an album and DVD in the Autumn in conjunction with Hollywood Records, VH1 and Queen Productions as a tribute to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Freddie´s death.\n\nSunday, March 4th 2001\n\nNew Queen tribute plans for November 2001/ Queen at Hall of Fame with John Deacon\n\n(source: MayBe website/\"Sponici\" newspaper (Japan))\n\nArticle from of \"Sponici\" - Japanese Tabloid - 1st March 2001\n\nContributors: Ayumi and Maki\n\n\"Queen has resurrected after 10 years!\"\n\nThe huge rock band Queen, that the late Freddie Mercury was in, who passed away because of AIDS in 1991, will revive after 10 years. Queen will be inducted to the Rock'n Roll Hall Of Fame as the first inductee in the 21st century. And the THREE members will attend to the ceremony on 19th March in New York.\n\nThis year is the 10th anniversary of Freddie's death and they start as Queen for the day, 24th Nov. They will resurrect taking advantage of the induction for The Rock'n Roll Of Fame though they looked to break up after Freddie's death.\n\nAccording to the information that has come to TOSHIBA EMI, some tribute plans are going on for the 10th anniversary. And lead plan is that Roger Taylor, Brian May and John Deacon will take some vocalists as substitute for Freddie and release an album as \"the 21st century type Queen\". The plan looks to be making steady progress.\n\nThere are some names as the candidate for substitute and George Michael is one of them who is ex-Wham. He has been discussed also several years ago, but that came to nothing because of his trouble between the record company and him. Japanese EMI stuffs said, \"There is a plan that the member will take plural vocalists for one album. But in any case, they will be able to release the NEW sound as the New Century type Queen for the memorial day of Freddie.\"\n\n(an omission of a middle of part about the recent reputations in Japan)\n\nThe whole three members will attend the ceremony on March 19th at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York.

The idea is to thread 3 different solos throughout the track with Wes being the other axeman. Brian and Steve\n\nare being sent the material on disc and will record their parts in Los Angeles and London before sending them back to us here at the studio to mix.\n\nThis also means that on the bonus disc I will have the option to deliver a couple of versions of \"3D\" with different mixes of the main solos.

The band was chosen in its second year of eligibility. LAUNCH asked Queen guitarist Brian May about his reaction to being among this year's inductees, who will be feted on March 19 in New York.\n\n\"I'm just very, very happy to hear [it],\" he said. \"When I looked at the list of the other guys who are being inducted, I felt very good. Seeing Michael Jackson in there and seeing Aerosmith in there-- my old buddies. I'm very, very happy to be included in the same bag as them--just happy overall.\"\n\nOne of the traditions of the hall's induction ceremonies is the performance and jam session. Asked who would be capable of filling the shoes of histrionic late vocalist Freddie Mercury for the event, May told LAUNCH, \"Well, I guess there's various thoughts. It'd be nice to get up there and team up with Aerosmith-- that's one thought that I had. It's something which has never happened. That would be a good thought. Further than that, we have been talking about various other things. There has been lots of rumors around,\" he added, laughing, \"but I'm not going to confirm any of those rumors.\"\n\nThose rumors include Queen's playing a few dates with British pop star Robbie Williams fronting the band. Although he didn't deny that rumor, he did come down on the British media for spreading the slew of recent Queen gossip in the U.K. press. \"I mean, the English press got ahold of some stuff, but they got hold of it through some rumor monger at a record company. So it's...They don't care. They'll print anything in England. I don't quite know what it's like in the States, but over here they'd rather print lies than truth, really.\"\n\nRumors abound that new Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame inductee Queen will perform dates with U.K. pop singer Robbie Williams on vocals. Queen guitarist Brian May revealed to LAUNCH that there have been talks with Williams, but it's definitely not a done deal.\n\n\"Well, I'll be honest with you,\" May said. \"We've been talking to Robbie and we've been playing around with Robbie, and we like him. And we've pushed various ideas around, but nothing has been decided yet, so if you see anything in the press, it's somebody jumping the gun. I think he's a great entertainer, and one of the few, I suppose, one of the few entertainers with a capital 'E' that I've seen emerge out of England in recent years. They're very few, very hard to find.\"\n\nMay added, \"We don't have any plans to do anything at this moment.\"\n\nWednesday, December 13th 2000\n\nQueen in the Rock´n Roll Hall of Fame\n\n(source: Rock´n Roll Hall of Fame webpage)\n\nTuesday, December 12, 2000, New York, NY -- The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees for the Sixteenth Annual Induction Ceremony were announced today at VH1 by Jann Wenner, Editor and publisher of Rolling Stone magazine. Here, in alphabetical order, are the Inductees for 2001:\n\nAerosmith, the original five bad boys from Boston -- Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer -- epitomize American blues-rooted style rock and roll and continue, after three decades, to rock our world;\n\nSolomon Burke who is known for having one of the greatest voices in the history of soul, gospel, R&B, and even country, and has influenced a vast array of artists;\n\nThe Flamingos, Chicago's pioneering doo-wop aggregation -- Nathaniel Nelson, John Carter, Terry Johnson, Tommy Hunt, Ezekiel Carey, Paul Wilson, Jacob Carey and Sollie McElroy -- gave us the trend-setting classic hit \"Golden Teardrops,\" and their soulful rendition of the pop standard, \"I Only Have Eyes For You\";\n\nMichael Jackson, who by age five was the designated lead singer of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees the Jackson 5, and only a few years later, launched a record breaking trend-setting solo career that included the world's biggest selling album, Thriller, which spent 37 weeks at #1 and sold more than 25-times platinum in the U.S. alone. There is no question that for the generation who came of age in the '80s, Michael epotimizes what rock is about;\n\nQueen, in the golden era of glam-rock and gorgeously hyper-produces theartical extravaganzas that defined one branch of '70s rock, no group came close in either concept or execution to Queen -- Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon;\n\nPaul Simon, already an Inductee as one half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, Simon launched his solo career three decades ago. From the release of the watershed album Graceland to his work for film and even Broadway, Paul Simon is one of rock's true visionaries;\n\nSteely Dan, no rock group before or since has applied more intellectual calisthenics to their wordplay, more bebop and swing jazz formalism to their charts, or more audiophile precision to their sonics. Fervently embraced by art-rock, conservatory, jazz fusion and engineering aficionados alike, Stelly Dan -- Walter Becker and Donald Fagen -- hold a very unique spot in the history of rock and roll;\n\nAt 17 years old, Ritchie Valens, less than seven months after the release of his first single, \"Come One Let's Go\" and exactly 26 days after \"La Bamba\" hit the pop charts, was killed in a plane crash on February 3, 1959, along with 22-year old Buddy Holly and 28-year old J.P. Richardson (\"The Big Bopper\"). Forty years after \"the day the music died,\" the echo of Valens' contribution to rock reverberates with an intensity that dares us to remember just how much \"the Little Richard of San Fernando\" gave to his fans and fellow musicians around the world; (...)\n\nNon-Performers: Chris Blackwell\n\nSide-Men: James Burton, Johnnie Johnson\n\nThe Sixteenth Annual Induction Ceremony will be held on Monday, March 19th at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. For the fifth year in a row, VH1 will exclusively air the ceremony; this year's telecast will take place on Wednesday, March 21st at 9:00p.m.\n\nArtists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria considered includes the influence and significance of the artist's contribution to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. Similar criteria is used for the \"Non Performer\" and \"Side-men\" category, whos career must have commenced at least 25 years prior to induction. Those eligible for the \"Non Performer\" category include songwriters, producers, disc jockeys, record company executives (who are mainly related to A&R), recording engineers, managers, journalists and other industry professionals.\n\nThe Foundation's nominating commitee, composed of rock and roll historians, selects nominees each year in the \"artist\" category. Ballots are then sent to an international voting body of about 1,000 rock experts.

Fontana, who played behind Elvis in that session nearly 50 years ago.\n\nSam Phillips launched the Memphis-based company in February 1952, drawing on the gospel, blues and country styles that\n\npermeated the area.\n\nSunday, October 1st 2000\n\nBrian and Roger attending the Queen ballet\n\n(source:Queenzone)\n\nThe Bejart Ballet, inspired by the life of Freddie Mercury and featuring music by Queen has been proclaimed a huge hit.\n\nBrian and Roger attended the performance and made their way onto the stage at the end to a raptuous applause.\n\nThe Ballet has proved so popular that extra shows have been added.\n\nThursday, September 28th 2000\n\ndetails about Tony Iommi´s solo-album with Brian on two tracks\n\n(source: electric basement/JenX)\n\nThe full track listing for the debut solo album from TONY IOMMI is as follows:\n\n'Laughing Man (In The Devil Mask)' featuring Henry Rollins\n\n'Meat' featuring Skin (Skunk Anansie)\n\n'Goodbye Lament' featuring Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters)/Brian May\n\n'Time Is Mine' featuring Phil Anselmo (Pantera)\n\n'Patterns' featuring Serj Tankian (System Of A Down)\n\n'Black Oblivion' featuring Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)\n\n'Flame On' featuring Ian Astbury (The Cult)/Brian May\n\n'Just Say No!' featuring Peter Steele (Type O Negative)\n\n'Who's Fooling Who' featuring Ozzy Osbourne\n\n'Into The Night' featuring Billy Idol\n\nWednesday, September 27th 2000\n\nBrian and Macy Gray news\n\n(source:Steve Hawkins/Queenzone)\n\nReports are circulating that the oft-touted coupling of Brian May and Macy Gray will happen in the not-too-distant future.\n\nI read in our local paper,that Brian and Macy`s duet will go ahead as planned and will be an acoustic based rock song.\n\nSomething surely to look forward too.\n\nThe song is bound to become a huge hit for both the aforementioned artists.Lets hope it gets another number 1!!!!!!\n\nWednesday, September 20th 2000\n\nBrian and the charity\n\n(source: Click2music/Brian´s office/Maybe)\n\nSeveral English musicians will work one day in one of the record stores from Tower Records. Reason: raising money for charity. From every person bying something they will ask 6 pounds. The Musicians would like to support The Future Forest Appeal, an organisation who wants to plant trees by the side of 'freeways'.\n\nBrian was approached by the Future Forests charity to do some p.r. with Five (when the single was due for release) at Tower Records. Unfortunately Five were touring so nothing ever came of it. However, Brian was very impressed with the charity's concept of 'carbon neutrality' (for all the bad stuff a company emits, it is calculated how many trees should be planted to compensate), Tower Records are to subscribe to this charity.\n\nHowever to cut a long story short, Brian has not been approached since that time, but it's possible his name has been included as a potential collaborator due to his previous interest, but at present there are no plans for such an appearance.\n\nHope that helps - it's definitely a cause to be aware of and hopefully one which more companies will subscribe to!\n\nMonday, September 18th 2000\n\nQueen- Platinum Collection\n\n(source: Gaffa magazine, Denmark/Queenzone)\n\nA Danish Magazine, 'Gaffa' has announced a new Queen release.

(...)\n\nSaturday, September 9th, 2000\n\nBrian´s new projects: Tony Iommi, Fish, Steve Hacket\n\nnew release of the Red Special by Fender\n\n(sources. Brian May list)\n\nHere are some news about projects Brian already did with artists, or will perhaps do in the future:\n\nBRIAN + TONY IOMMI\n\nTony Iommi´s new album will be simply called \"Iommi\" and will be out on October 10th 2000. Brian is reported to have worked on two tracks for this album. The title of one track is \"Goodbye Lament\".\n\nBRIAN + STEVE HACKETT\n\nSteve Hackett is about to re-release a long lost recording from 1986, a collaboration with Steve Howe entitled \"Feedback\".\n\nRelease date: October 9th 2000. Featuring special guests Brian May, Ian Mosley, Pete Trewavas, Chris Thompson and Bonnie Tyler. \"Feedback\" contains much material that would have made up the aborted second GTR album.\n\nThe tracklist is...\n\nCassandra\n\nPrize Fighters\n\nSlot Machine\n\nStadiums of the Damned\n\nDon't Fall\n\nOh How I Love You\n\nNotre Dame Des Fleurs\n\nThe Gulf\n\nSo folks, there you have it: \"Cassandra\" [definitive with Brian] -- \"Slot Machine\" [an unreleased track feat. Brian!!], \"Don't Fall\"\n\n[maybe a version of \"Don't Fall Away From Me\" - another Hackett / Brian May collaboration] and \"Oh How I Love You\" [there are rumours that this track also feat. Brian].\n\nQUEEN + FISH\n\nQueen are said to be in-line to do some music for a film about Robbie Burns.\n\nThe Daily Record had this to say: ROCK supergroup Queen will head a star-studded cast to record the original works of Robert Burns. Clarinda, a movie based on the life of the Bard, will start filming next year and already interest in it is huge.\n\nBefore the film has even been cast, the overture has been written and recorded and a soundtrack CD is being put together.\n\nContracts have been exchanged between the movie makers and stars like Queen and Fish.\n\nPurists might imagine Burns spinning in his grave at the idea - but in fact he'd probably have approved.\n\nProducer Ed Crozier said: \"Burns was the first pop star. When he died, 30,000 people went to his funeral. There has never been a funeral in Scotland of that size since.\"\n\nThe album will be a diverse mix of rock and classic artistes performing original Burns tracks and new songs specially written for the movie. One song being penned by Fish and Queen guitarist Brian May is likely to become an anthem which could rocket straight to the top of the charts. The song will be linked to the friendship between Burns and his best friend, lawyer Gavin Hamilton - a role expected to be taken by Robert Carlyle.\n\nFish said: \"I am involved in writing and pulling together some people to work on it.\" (...) The Record exclusively revealed plans for the film 15 months ago, and earlier this year we told how Johnny Depp was being lined up to play Burns.\n\nDepp, who has a gift for accents, is expected to be more convincing in the role than Mel Gibson was in Braveheart.\n\n(...) Interest in the film is growing daily and a website set up to give information about it has had 800 hits already from all over the world - before it is even supposed to be on-line.\n\nFish's latest e-mail to his fans contains the following paragraph...\n\nThere have been rumours of a Brian May involvement (Hi Motti) in my career. I can only say that I have talked to Brian a few times in recent months and we are looking at an idea of writing together for the \"Clarinda\" movie due to start shooting in March/April 2001. Nothing is definite yet but our intentions are clear. All I can say is that Brian and I are good friends\n\nand he has expressed a clear desire to work together at some point and that he would love to contribute to a project if only as a \"cameo\" role. The situation is open and time will tell what happens.\n\nNEW GULD BHM GUITARS FOR 2002\n\nNew copies of the Red Special will be released in 2002. Fender will produce the guitars with assistance fromGreg Fryer - an Australian who restored Brian's guitar prior to the 'Another World' tour.\n\nMonday, August 28th 2000\n\nRobbie Williams to join Queen?\n\n(source: Daily Express, August 28th 2000)\n\nThe following is from Daily Express (an English newspaper) from today, posted on the Brian May list.\n\nMy personal opinion: I think that would be REALLY a wonderful thing and that´s the best thing I´ve heard for a long long time!!!\n\nBTW, Robbie Williams is a big Queen fan and I know that he would love to cover \"Death on two legs\".\n\nBut now to the article:\n\n\"I want to be the new king of Queen, says Robbie\"\n\nRobbie Williams has revealed his secret ambition to join pop group Queen as a replacement for the late Freddie Mercury. The former Take That singer told radio listeners 'Do you know what I would really like to do? To front Queen. I should do, shouldn't I?'\n\nQueen guitarist Brian May is enthusiastic about the plan. \"He told me, 'That's a fantastic idea'\" said the group's manager Jim Beach. \"So if Robbie is serious about it then we'd be glad to talk to him. Brian is a great fan of his\". ...Queen recently joined forces with boy band Five to record a chart topping version of 'We Will Rock You'. This was a carefully calculated\n\nmove to introduce the band to a much younger generation. Although it is unlikely Robbie would record an album with Queen or tour with them, a collaboration would prove extremely lucrative. Peter Freestone, Mercury's best friend and valet, says he can easily see Robbie working with the band.\n\n\"I heard 'Millenium' on the radio the other day and I really liked the sound of his voice. I genuinely thought he'd do well working with Queen\", he said. \"He's a showman in the Freddie vein\".\n\nThursday, August 24 th 2000\n\nBrian on Steve Hacket album\n\n(source: www.genesis-path.com)\n\nSteve Hackett has dug in his archive, and the result will be available on October 9th. This is the unreleased 1986 studio album, including 20 mp3's - and special guest appearances by Brian May, Ian Mosley, Pete Trewavas and Chris Thompson. Check out this space and Hackett's own site www.stevehackett.com for further updates.\n\nMonday, July 31st 2000\n\nBrian and Five doing a whole show in Rio??\n\n(source: Arnaldo José Alves Silveira -Brian May list)\n\n\"Sunday, July 30th 2000, 16h36min\n\nBritney Spears and 'N Sync are the first international stars cofirmed for the first night of Rock In Rio 3...\n\n... Britney and 'N Sync will be on the pop night of the festival, along with Brazilian stars Fernanda Abreu, Funk'n Lata, Pato Fu and Sandy e Júnior. There is still a third international attraction being negotiated - the group Five and the guitarrist BRIAN MAY would do together a show in tribute to the group QUEEN.\"\n\nWednesday, July 26th 2000\n\nBrian to work with Five again in the future\n\n(source: www.dotmusic.com)\n\nGuitarist May is to collaborate with the boys on their next album.\n\nTheir first single together reached number one this week when Ronan Keating was removed from the top slot for breaking chart rules. His singles sales were disqualified after it was realised his CD also included a CD Rom interview.\n\nFive's Ritchie says: \"It's amazing working with Roger [Taylor  Queen's drummer] and Brian. They are both really, really cool guys. Brian is even going to be working on a couple of songs for our third album.\"\n\n\"There's a real good rapport between Five and Queen right now.\"\n\nWednesday, July 19th 2000\n\nBrian and Roger live at the \"Party in the park\"\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club)\n\n(c) OK magazine\n\nThe gig itself was good fun - at least as a spectator. I know the bands themselves had dreadful problems with the sound, their\n\nmicrophones, monitors etc. Personally I think Queen and Five stole the show - their set was LIVE and they had the place\n\nreally rocking...especially with Tie Your Mother Down! The place went wild, which was great, but odd really seeing as the\n\nmajority of the audience were probably babes in arms when Queen did that one originally!! Then after they left the stage it\n\nall kind of fizzled as an array of talentless \"pop stars\" paraded on and off - it was like karaoke in front of 100 thousand\n\npeople! (...) It was such a went and dismal day... but backstage was another\n\nmatter!.(...) Roger stayed for much of the day, Debbie was there with Tiger Lilly and Rufus. Brian stayed all day as he also went on for the finale and did \"A Little Help From My Friends\".\n\nBrian's children - Jimmy, Louise and Emily - and Anita were all there and enjoying the day too. All in all it was a good fun day!\n\nWednesday, June 19th 2000\n\nEric Singer covers a Queen classic\n\n(source: Official Eric Singer website)\n\nEric recorded \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" for another Queen tribute album with Tony Frankling on bass (The Firm, Blue Murder). Eric said : \"It was great to play with such awesome bassplayer \".\n\nWednesday, June 7th 2000\n\n\"Mission Impossible 2\" premiere\n\n\"We will rock you\" by Five, together with Brian and Roger, live-dates and release date\n\n\"Furia\" soundtrack in the cinemas\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club)\n\nTuesday 4th July - Mission impossible 2 premieres here in the UK - I feel sure a certain clogged guitar God will be in attendance if\n\nhe's in the UK! The film goes on general release on July 7th.\n\nAlso on July 7th British TV show Top Of The Pops (BBC ONE about 7pm) will give a special preview of the new Five single We Will Rock You, and they will be joined live in the studio by Brian and Roger.\n\nOn July 9th the huge Capitol Radio \"Party In The Park\" takes place in London's Hyde Park. A multitude of the current top\n\nnames will be appearing (including Boyzone, Westlife, Steps, and Savage Garden plus heaps of others) Amongst\n\nthat list of notables of the pop world will be FIVE..... and guess who are going to join them live on the day?\n\nBrian and Roger of course!! (...)\n\nTickets for Party In The Park sold out within hours of going on sale, but I feel sure it will be filmed and recorded by Capital Radio for future broadcast.\n\nJuly 17th sees the release of the Five single in the UK and Europe. (...)\n\nOn August 9th the film 'FURIA' is put on general release in France. We still don't know a release date for the soundtrack\n\nthough.\n\nWednesday, April 13th 2000\n\nFuria news\n\n(source: Sébastien /France)\n\nNow it is sure : FURIA WILL BE ON SCREEN IN FRANCE IN JUNE 2000!!!!\n\nSaturday, April 1st 2000\n\n\"We will rock you\" videoclip with Brian and Roger\n\nFuria premiere\n\nBrian´s new work\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club/Italian Queen Fan Club)\n\nBrian and Roger are going to be making a video with FIVE on Sunday April 2nd for the single release of We Will Rock\n\nYou. Five are playing Wembley Arena Saturday and Sunday - and it's possible that Brian MIGHT play live with them Saturday and then do the video shoot Sunday, but this isn't confirmed yet. (the single is due for release on June 19th).\n\nAlexandre Aja's movie \"FURIA\", for which Brian wrote all the original score will be specially shown for the first time this week during the \"Festival du film de Paris\" on Saturday, April 1st. I think the film is on competition and there will be three projections during this day. There is still no release date for this very underground movie nor for the original music.\n\nToni Iommi's solo album will be released in June. Brian plays on 2 tracks\n\n\"The Stretch\" which is, if my mind serves me right, Anita's latest TV work with Brian's soundtrack,\n\nwill be broadcasted on SKY ONE in September.\n\nSunday, March 19th 2000\n\nStone Temple Pilots and The King to cover Queen\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club/The May-keteers Homepage)\n\nThe Stone Temple pilots will cover 'Sheer Heart Attack' from the 'News of the World' album.

Neither Brian or Roger played anything but the new mix of WWRY, Bono met Roger briefly in the bar of his hotel for a drink, none of them even SAW Mel C, and the drummer from Crush got Roger's autograph in the bar of the pub....\"\n\nMonday, February 7th 2000\n\nMel C and Bono\n\n(source: RTL2 teletext, Germany)\n\nMaybe, Spice Girl Mel C will be (one of the) leadsinger(s) on the forthcoming Queen album. She was in Dublin and met Brian and Roger in the studios. She is not the only person who is interested in the project. U2 singer Bono was also there. We can be tense what will happen!\n\nSunday, February 6th 2000\n\nBrian and Roger working together with Mel C and Bono!\n\nBrian at Roger playing live at some Guns´n Roses gigs!\n\n(source: Irish Star Newspaper)\n\nSporty Spice linked up with veteran rockers Queen and Bono last night for an impromptu session in a Dublin recording studio.\n\nMel C was in the city to film a television special with local girl Emma Ledden, the presenter of BBC's Saturday morning show \"Live and Kicking\". After a tour of a couple of Dublin's top pubs, the Spice Girl joined Brian May and Roger Taylor\n\ndown at Bono's Windmill Studios.\n\nAnd there is speculation that the Spice Girl will appear on a new album that Queen have begun recording in Dublin.\n\nPLANS\n\nTaylor and May took time out to give and up and coming local band a few pointers. Three piece outfit Crush, who are currently negotiating a contract with Island records, met up with the two veterans at Dave Egan's Bruxelles pub.\n\nPromoter Jock McDonald said: \"They all went up to a studio in the top room of the pub and played a few tunes\". \"Roger gave drummer Keith Walker a few tips. The young fella was astounded to see his heroes in front of him.\n\nTaylor also revealed plans to get together with Axl Rose, of Guns and Roses, for a couple of gigs.\n\nSunday, January 30th 2000\n\nBrian and Roger together live again\n\nBrian working on a new project\n\n(source: WWRY)\n\nBrian and Roger will be special guests at the live appearance of 5ive at the Brit Awards 2000.\n\nThe event will take place at London´s Earls Court on March 3rd 2000.\n\nBrian returned home from the USA after he recorded some guitar parts for the new Guns´n Roses album\n\nBrian is currently working on the main theme of a future UK TV serie called \"The Stretch\" (in which Anita Dobson is starring).\n\nSunday, January 30th 2000\n\nBrian as a guest at the Oxford Union\n\n(source: JenX)\n\nI have had confirmation that Brian will indeed be addressing the Oxford Union on Tuesday 7 March 2000.\n\nHe will talk about his life with Queen.

There's some other really heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot.\n\nI go back to listening to Queen -- you know, we're still hoping to have Brian May come in and do some tracks, and I got a fax today that he's coming in -- Queen had all kinds of different-style songs on their records, and that's something that I like. 'Cause I do listen to a lot of things, and I really don't like being pigeonholed to that degree, and it's something that\n\nGuns N' Roses seem to share [with Queen] a bit.\n\nWith \"Appetite,\" even though it seems to have the same sound, if you really go back, you can pull all the little parts from different influences. That's not really the case by the time we're on \"Use Your Illusion.\" People are kind of set in their ways. [\"Chinese Democracy\"] is coming from all over the place.\n\nTuesday, December 7th 1999\n\nNew Brian recordings in the future\n\n(source: Official International Queen Fan Club)\n\nBrian has said that he WILL be playing on the future Guns N Roses album, and will fly out to the USA in January to work with Axl Rose on this. He wont confirm or deny the rumours that he might play live with him too though, so we have to keep\n\nguessing on that one for now!\n\nBrian has also recently played on his good friend TONY IOMMI's new album. This hasn't got a title yet, nor a release date, but Brian played on two tracks, \"Goodbye Lament\", also featuring David Grohl, and \"Flame Up\" featuring Ian Aspbury (The\n\nCult) on vocals.

Why do you like doing them (such as \"Antmusic\" or \"Making Plans For Nigel\"), and are there other songs that you really want to do?\n\nRobbie says:\n\nIt's really weird because those aren't my favourite songs at all. I did \"Making Plans for Nigel\" out of spite for someone I know called Nigel and \"Ant Music\" I did because ... I don't know! I wouldn't mind doing \"Death on Two Legs\" by Queen ...\n\nMSN Live says:\n\nThe Queen thing is interesting do you see any similarities many of the emails we received mentioned the similarity people saw between you and Freddie Mercury ?\n\nRobbie says:\n\nWell, I got rid of the handlebar moustache which didn't seem to work. :o) I do a lot of pretending on stage, if I'm not happy sometimes being Robbie, sometimes I just want to be someone else.
