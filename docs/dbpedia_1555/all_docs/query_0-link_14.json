        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nI hope you’re well and in good spirits. I have not made any public statements regarding my relationship with Black Sabbath since February 2012. Today, I want to address that relationship in this formal statement. Thank you.\n\nI have neither severed nor discontinued my relationship with Black Sabbath, however, since 2012, the often inaccurate statements about me as a person and as a musician have caused me to be guarded and be especially detached emotionally and spiritually from Ozzy. His rhetoric above all has brought me the most discord. The continuing misguided information about me has established a necessity on my part to confront these issues. And now, with the imminent release of a new Bill Ward Band album, and the flurry of rumors about new Sabbath projects, I feel it appropriate to speak in a truthful and an un-cynical way.\n\nThere is always speculation about a true, original Sabbath lineup for the next tour or record. With a sad heart, I have to say I will not participate in any musical undertakings until a righting of the wrongs spoken against me has been achieved. I must admit, I have little to no expectations of this happening, but in the order of first things first, I’m looking for an honest accountability of all of Ozzy’s statements that I felt were untrue. I would want Ozzy to amend his opinions and exaggerations. I would want him to be forthcoming about his unrealistic viewpoints. And because I was chastised publicly, I would want him to amend publicly in his words, and not through an Ozzy representative, the nature of the wrongs. I would not want to continue on with him without this seemingly impassible dilemma being addressed. I don’t think previously strong relationships can remain strong after dispute by just sweeping the offensive stuff under the carpet, or by saying a puny sorry, or “oh, that’s all over now.” It doesn’t work like that for me. Righting of wrong works, and that’s what I want if I’m ever going to be his friend again.\n\nStill undone and faraway is a “signable” contract. I would require a “signable” contract before moving one step toward a pathway that could lead to us all playing together again. I want a contract I can approve. That’s my truth. That’s my stand. I’ve listened to nothing but insults and false remarks, and if as a band or as individuals they wish to continue along the same lines, then any notion of an original Black Sabbath lineup will continue to fade away.\n\nPut simply, it’s up to them. I have dearly missed playing with them and as people, I have been heartbroken over the loss of who I thought we were. And now you know where I stand.\n\nVery soon my band, BWB will release a new album ironically called “Accountable Beasts.” I re- kick-started it in May 2012, and in an off and on journey to record, we have reached our final destination – a good mix, and a well mastered record. At this time we are putting the final touches on the digital booklet.\n\nThere are other multiple projects in different stages of progress, and I hope to bring more definitive news about them as things unfold this year. I have been very happy writing new songs, playing drums and working with other musicians. I have been blessed with musical visions and the ability to harness them. I’m moving into the future with an optimistic outlook.\n\nFor our many Sabbath fans, I love you all dearly. You are extremely special people. You fucking rock. I have been in deep regret since January 2012 that a true union was denied. I’ve remained faithful to you and honest with myself. Had I not been honest throughout I would have perished long ago. My hand is within yours, and I am encouraged to know you better. Stay safe and stay strong.\n\nNow it is time to meet the circumstances of my statement and attend to what else is ongoing and before me.\n\nLove,\n\nBill Ward\n\nHi everyone, it’s Bill Ward checking in.\n\nI wanted to say a great big thank you again to all the wonderful people who attended our two day Gallery Art Exhibit In Annapolis on May 9 and 10, 2014.\n\nI miss you all very much already. Thank you for the love that came between us, thank you for your open minds and hearts, thank you for your generous compliments in the support of my art, and your experiences, for hardships sustained.\n\nI can see a lot of your faces as I’m writing this brief note. You’re all incredibly special people. I was touched deeply by the many intimate moments we shared.\n\nThank you for all the presents, CD’s, cake, health food, pictures, and more that you gave me.\n\nBack at home I found a poem I wrote in 2012? 2013? that I wanted to share with you as a further embrace, and a gesture of my memory of you.\n\nStay safe, lots of love to you all. Here’s the poem.\n\nSOUL DEVOURING THINGS\n\nSOUL DEVOURING THINGS\n\nWILL APPEAR AS VICTORIOUS\n\nFROM TIME TO TIME\n\nHOWEVER PASSION AND FEARLESS ACTIONS\n\nWILL ALWAYS, CALM AND NULLIFY\n\nTHE RAUCOUS OUTCRIES\n\nUNRAVELED AT FIRST\n\nBY MONSTERS\n\nWE OVERCOME\n\nAND STAND IN TRUTH\n\nWITH PEACE OF MIND\n\n© BILL WARD\n\nH! Everyone,\n\nI hope you’re well. I’m re-starting the radio show on Saturday, February, 15, 2014. As many of you know, I’ve been in hospital for a while (our last radio show was in August 2013). I had a final operation on January 7, 2014, and I’m very pleased to say that a positive outcome has prevailed. I’m healing slowly and surely. On September 18, 2013, I thought I’d take advantage of the down time and have a right shoulder repair surgery. Four days after that surgery, I had the perforated diverticulitis. I’m mentioning the shoulder surgery because approximately two weeks ago, we finally started the shoulder rehab. It’ll be about six weeks before the frozen joints can be workable again. I’m hoping to be playing drums by mid-March 2014. I want to start back in with jam sessions with a jazz quartet, something softer before I start slamming again.\n\nOn January 23, 2014, I received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the NAMM Bonzo Bash. Again, multiple thanks to everyone who made that award happen for me. Special thanks to all the drummers at the bash, and it was great to be among the families and fans, and so many kick-ass drummers. My heart is with the students and the old-timers.\n\nThis year on our radio show I intend to feature some of my favorite drummers. We’ll have our very best of Metal, but we’ll also focus on hopefully surprising the listener with recordings from drummers, well-known and lesser-known. I’m trying to find rare jams, drum solos – it’ll be about drummers all year long.\n\nOur first drummer to be featured will be the amazing Dave Lombardo. Dave is quite brilliant, and his music will be worth listening to. I also hope to feature a couple of tracks from the early Zeppelin era with the one and only John Bonham. Metallica, Motorhead and Phil Anselmo will be played on the show, and I just picked up Light Up and Live by Harsh Toke, hoping to find something nice to play. Further, we’ll be playing our Buddy, Ritchie and Big Bopper memorial. Happy 50th Birthday, Beatles.\n\nIt’s exhilarating to be back with the living! Check out the show if you can.\n\nStay safe. Stay Strong.\n\n–Bill"
