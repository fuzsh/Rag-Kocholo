        "text": "Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died at the age of 73.\n\nHis family have confirmed his death in a statement released by solicitors Swan Turton, who are acting on their behalf.\n\n“It is with great sadness that the family of Peter Green announce his death this weekend, peacefully in his sleep,” the statement read. “A further statement will be provided in the coming days.”\n\nThe guitarist was born in London on October 29, 1946. He played in several bands after beginning to play professionally at the age of 15, including Bobby Dennis And The Dominoes, and The Muskrats.\n\nIn 1965, he met drummer Mick Fleetwood while a member of Peter B’s Looners, with whom he would go on to form Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac alongside guitarist Jeremy Spencer. John McVie later replaced Bob Brunning on bass and the band released their self-titled debut album in February 1968.\n\nHe released two more albums with Fleetwood Mac – ‘Mr. Wonderful’ in August 1968 and 1969’s ‘Then Play On’. Green made his final appearance with the band on May 20, 1970, before leaving the band. During his time in the group, he wrote songs including ‘Albatross’, ‘Oh Well’, ‘Man Of The World’, ‘Green Manalishi’ and ‘Black Magic Woman’.\n\nAfter Fleetwood Mac, he began to work on solo material, releasing his debut solo album ‘The End Of The Game’ in 1970. He released a further five records over the next 13 years, ending with ‘Kolors’ in 1983. A year later, he put out the album ‘A Case For The Blues’ as part of new band Katmandu. It was to be their only album and they split in 1985.\n\nIn the late ‘90s, Green formed the Peter Green Splinter Group with guitarist Nigel Watson and drummer Cozy Powell. They released nine albums between 1997 and 2004, when Green quit the group. After a five-year break, Green began touring again as Peter Green And Friends.\n\nGreen was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame with Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and was named by Rolling Stone in 2015 as one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time.\n\nTributes have begun to pour in for Green from stars and fans alike. “Most sadly have lost one of the most tasteful guitar players ever I have always been a huge admirer of the great Peter Green may he rest in peace,” Peter Frampton tweeted.\n\n“Rest easy, Peter Green,” Sleaford Mods wrote alongside a video of him performing ‘Oh Well’ with Fleetwood Mac in 1969.\n\nMumford & Sons’ Winston Marshall called Green the “GOAT”. “Man of the world, oh well, albatross, need your love so bad. Some of my favourites songs and performances of all time,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for the music.”\n\nSee more tributes to Green below.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."
