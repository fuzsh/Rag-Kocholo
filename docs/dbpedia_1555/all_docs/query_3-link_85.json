        "text": "Every September (this year I’m running a little behind!), I begin cataloging the following year’s cookbook releases. I do this for several reasons: 1) so our members know what is waiting down the pipeline and 2) it makes the monthly new cookbook reviews a little easier for me as I keep the original post updated when changes occur. As I did last year, I have organized the monthly releases by country. As I continue to update and add new books, those new additions will always be at the top of each month/country. For reference the 2023 Preview post can be found here.\n\nA few authors have mentioned that the amount of pre-orders weigh into how much money the publishing companies put into publicity for a particular cookbook, so preorder your favorites. Using our Buy Book button earns EYB an affiliate commission but also please remember your local bookshops.\n\nThere are loads of other books to be added but the ISBNs have not been shared yet so check back every week or so for updates. Start building your wish list now. PLEASE NOTE: There are many other books to add – most of them international and have to be added manually and I am working on them as I can.\n\nIt may not look like it but this list took over a week to compile! I tried to update author profiles as I went and will continue to catch those up. A quick glance shows us a plethora of cocktail, foraging, vegetable and “board” cookbooks. So grab a cocktail and sit back and see what the new year will bring.\n\nA few highlights: Milk Street Bakes by Christopher Kimball; Zahav Home by Michael Solomonov; Sunlight and Breadcrumbs by Renee Erickson; Salty, Cheesy, Herby, Crispy Snackable Bakes by Jessie Sheehan; Chinese Enough by Kristina Cho; Easy Wins by Anna Jones; The Big Book of Bread by James Morton; Italian American Forever by Alex Guarnaschelli; Classic German Cooking by Luisa Weiss; Bobby Flay Chapter One by Bobby Flay; Salad for Days by Alice Zaslavsky; A Slow Rise by Daniel Leader; 100 Afternoon Sweets by Sarah Kieffer; The Side Gardener by Rosie Daykin; Crust: Essential Sweets and Savories from Victoria’s Beloved Bakery by Tom Moore; Life’s Sweetest Moments by Dominique Ansel; Kids Cook Everything by Mark Bittman; Babette’s Bread by Babette Kourelos; What Goes with What by Julia Turshen; The Cake Bible, 35th Anniversary Edition by Rose Levy Beranbaum; Cooking and the Crown by Tom Parker Bowles; The Bean Book by Steve Sando; Zoë Bakes Cookies by Zoë François; Mastering the Art of Plant-Based Cooking by Joe Yonan; Tipo 00 The Pasta Cookbook by Andreas Papadakis; Eleven Madison Park: The Plant-Based Chapter by Daniel Humm; A Thousand Feasts: Small Moments of Joy from the Kitchen, Garden and Elsewhere by Nigel Slater; Nights Out at Home: Recipes and Stories from 25 Years as a Restaurant Critic by Jay Rayner; Rick Stein’s Food Stories by Rick Stein; Romy Gill’s India: Recipes from Home by Romy Gill; Danube: Recipes and Stories from Along the Banks of Eastern Lands by Irina Georgescu; Sweet Seasons: Wholesome Treats For Every Occasion by Pippa and Michael James; When Southern Women Cook: History, Lore, and 300 Recipes from Every Corner of the American South by America’s Test Kitchen; Bake Club: 101 Must-Have Moves for Your Kitchen by Christina Tosi and Shannon Salzano; Very Good Bread: The Science of Dough and the Art of Making Bread at Home by Melissa Weller.and Sugar Farm! by Molly Yeh.\n\nJanuary\n\nUnited States\n\nEasy Al Fresco: The Magic of Simple Outdoor Feasts by Ilse van der Merwe (US/South Africa)\n\nCool Food: Erasing Your Carbon Footprint One Bite at a Time by Robert Downey Jr, and Thomas Kostigen\n\n15 Minute Meals: Truly Quick Recipes that Don’t Taste Like Shortcuts by Ali Rosen\n\nImad’s Syrian Kitchen: A Love Letter from Damascus by Imad Alarnab (US release)\n\nZaatari: Culinary Traditions of the World’s Largest Syrian Refugee Camp by Karen E.
