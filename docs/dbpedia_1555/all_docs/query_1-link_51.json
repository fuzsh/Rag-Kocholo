        "text": "The Craig - I Must Be Mad\n\nReleased 1966\n\nRichard King - guitar\n\nLen Cox - bass\n\nJeff Brown - lead vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nA rampant, unhinged slice of freakbeat, all straining amps and Carl's neo-Keith Moon style kit abuse. The recording is all the more remarkable when one considers that Carl was a comparatively callow youth of fifteen at the time.\n\nThe Chants - Love Light\n\nReleased 1966\n\nEddie Amoo - vocals\n\nEddie Ankrah - vocals\n\nJoe Ankrah - vocals\n\nAlan Fielding - vocals\n\nNat Smedo - vocals\n\nThis would be Carl's first paid session, playing on the song 'Love Light'. The Chants had a minor footnote in the history of BritPop by dint of their being the first British based all black vocal groups. A potentially tidy living awaited Carl as a session drummer but some sound advice from his father dissuaded him from entering the world of recording sessions in a career way.\n\nChris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds - Moanin'\n\nReleased 1967\n\nChris Farlowe - vocals\n\nAlbert Lee - guitar\n\nRicky Chapman - Bass\n\nPeter Solley - Organ\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nAtomic Rooster - Atomic Rooster\n\nReleased February 1970\n\nRecorded December 1969 - January 1970\n\nVincent Crane - Organ, vocals\n\nNick Graham - Bass, vocals, flute\n\nJohn Du Cann - guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nIt was with Atomic Rooster that Carl Palmer enjoyed his first real success as a founding member of a band. At the age of 18, replacing drummer Drachen Theaker, Carl Palmer joined up with The Crazy World of Arthur Brown at the absolute peak of their success following the smash single 'Fire' (\"I am the God of Hellfire...\"). Top 10 around the world, Palmer arrived at a time when the band was touring with some of the biggest names in music. After brief rehearsals the lineup set out on an arduous U.S. tour alongside the cream of the rock world including the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Premier Cast of Hair, Iron Butterfly and others. Contrary to popular belief, Carl is not on the LP recording, but he was the touring drummer for the record, playing over fifty gigs. From the first time Palmer started working with Atomic Rooster he realized that a trio worked best for him.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Emerson, Lake & Palmer\n\nReleased November, 1970 (UK) January 13, 1971 (US)\n\nRecorded July to September 1970 at Advision Studios\n\nBillboard charts #18; UK charts #4\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe outfit in which Carl's name would come to be carved into rock history. In the spring of 1970, Carl Palmer received a phone call that changed his life forever. Keyboard virtuoso Keith Emerson was forming a new band with Greg Lake. After trying out several drummers, including Mitch Mitchell, the two wanted Palmer to audition for a spot in the new trio but Palmer was uncertain if he wanted to leave the growing success of Atomic Rooster behind. Reluctantly, he agreed to meet and rehearse with the band and thank God he did. The following month the group finished its self-titled debut album, instantly successful, it climbed to the Top 5 in England and the Top 20 in America. And included the classic single \"Lucky Man\".\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Tarkus\n\nReleased June 14, 1971 (UK) August 1971 (US)\n\nRecorded January 1971 Advision Studios\n\nBillboard charts # 9; UK charts #1\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe 1971 follow-up album, Tarkus, propelled the ELP's sound in new directions and was the first real test for the band's cohesiveness. Palmer had come up with an unusual drum pattern he wanted to incorporate. Arguments ensued and, when Greg Lake said he wouldn't be involved, it looked like that might be it for ELP. In the end, there was agreement (or agreement to disagree) and the album, which for many came to define ELP's sound, was released. The cover artwork of the Armadillo tank and inside gatefold story were originated and painted by visual artist, William Neal.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Pictures At An Exhibition\n\nReleased November 1971 (UK) January 4, 1972 (US)\n\nRecorded March 26, 1971 Newcastle City Hall upon Tyne\n\nBillboard charts #10 UK charts #3\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nBPI Silver\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nOn the heels of Tarkus's rise to #1 on the UK charts and Top 10 in the America, ELP arrived at Newcastle City Hall on March 21, 1971, to perform and record Pictures At An Exhibition live, their signature adaptation of Modest Mussorgsky's 'Pictures at an Exhibition.' When released, that album too became a great success. The album cover concept was originated, designed, and completed with 7 large original paintings by visual artist, William Neal.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Trilogy\n\nReleased July 6, 1972 (US)\n\nRecorded January 1972 Advision Studios\n\nBillboard charts #5; UK charts #2\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nTrilogy Increased ELP's worldwide popularity, and included \"Hoedown\", which was one of their most popular songs when performing live. The song \"Endless Enigma Part One\" opens with the sound of a beating heart, an effect created by the bass drum pedal of Palmer's Ludwig Octopus kit. Notably, this effect was invented by Carl Palmer before it was used on Jethro Tull's 'A Passion Play' (1973). \"From the Beginning\" reached #39 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Brain Salad Surgery\n\nReleased November 19, 1973 (US)\n\nRecorded June to September 1973 Advision Studios\n\nBillboard charts #11; UK charts #2\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe first under their Manticore Records imprint. It features cover art by surreal artist H. R. Giger. The album cover is considered one of the most memorable (and often disturbing) of its time. Perhaps the band's definitive work. Bearing such memorable work as 'Karn Evil 9', 'Still You Turn Me On' and 'Jerusalem', the album is highlighted by 'Toccata', a reworking of Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera's Piano Concerto No. 1, and some of Carl Palmer's most amazing drumming and synthesized percussion work. So incredible and original was the performance in fact that Ginastera himself endorsed the recording.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Welcome Back My Friends...\n\nReleased August 19, 1974 (US)\n\nRecorded February 2, 1974 Convention Center, Anaheim, Ca.\n\nBillboard charts #4; UK charts #5\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nOriginally released as a three-disk vinyl album, but is now a double CD, in a gatefold cover, the inside of which used the letters \"E\", \"L\" and \"P\" as retainers for the individual disks. During 1973 and 1974, ELP toured on their Someone Get Me a Ladder Tour all around the world, and this album captures the representative musical sound of that tour. The title of the album comes from the opening line of the song \"Karn Evil 9: First Impression, Part 2\" as well as the introduction to the performance, uttered at the beginning of the song \"Hoedown.\"\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Works, Volume I\n\nReleased March 22, 1977 (US)\n\nRecorded 1976\n\nBillboard charts #12; UK charts #9\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nBPI Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\n'Works, Volume I' is a double album divided into four major sections, one each highlighting each band member, and one for combined works. It was decided that each would have a solo side followed by a fourth side featuring the band as a unit. For his part, Carl Palmer's contribution featured big band recordings recorded with 60's and 70's pianist & big band leader Harry South, as well as some individual tracks, including \"LA Nights\" with guitarist Joe Walsh of the Eagles. The real gem from this period, however, was Palmer's own epic \"Concerto for Percussion\" which, sadly, would wait nearly twenty years before finally being released on the Carl Palmer Anthology, \"Do ya wanna play, Carl?\"\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Works, Volume 2\n\nReleased November 1, 1977 (US)\n\nRecorded 1973- 1977\n\nBillboard charts #37; UK charts #20\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nWorks, Volume II was a single album which seemingly was a compilation of leftover tracks from other album sessions that had not made those albums. While many derided the album for its apparent lack of focus, others felt it showed a different side of the band, with blues, bluegrass and jazz being very prominent as musical genres in this recording.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Love Beach\n\nReleased November 18, 1978\n\nRecorded 1978\n\nBillboard charts #55; UK charts 48\n\nRIAA Gold\n\nBPI Silver\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nLove Beach was the band's final album of original studio recordings until Black Moon (1992), and was produced to satisfy contractual obligations with the group's record company. It was a critical and commercial disappointment, charting at #55 on the Billboard 200, although it did eventually go gold. The group was reportedly not satisfied with the album; drummer Carl Palmer even compared the portrait of the band in the cover photograph as more akin to disco stars the Bee Gees. Critical appraisal of the album is mixed; some reviewers consider it the nadir of ELP's 1970s output, while others refer to the continued popularity of songs such as \"Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman\".\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - In Concert\n\nReleased November 18, 1979\n\nRecorded August 26, 1977 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium\n\nBillboard # 73\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nIn Concert is a live album, recorded at the Montreal's Olympic Stadium which is featured on the album cover. In Concert showcased fan favorites of previously released material. The band hired a 70-piece orchestra for some concerts of this tour but eventually had to dismiss the orchestra due to budget constraints that almost bankrupted the group. On the original release, the orchestra performs on \"C'est la Vie\", \"Knife Edge\", on Keith Emerson's piano concerto, and on \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". The 1993 rerelease of the LP (Works Live) adds another four songs performed with the orchestra: \"Fanfare for the Common Man\", \"Abaddon's Bolero\", \"Closer to Believing\" and \"Tank\".\n\nPM - 1:PM\n\nReleased 1980\n\nTodd Cochran - vocals, keyboards\n\nJohn Nitzinger - guitar, vocals\n\nErik Scott - bass, vocals\n\nBarry Finnerty - lead guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nCarl formed his own band, PM, for which he recruited vocalist Todd Cochran from the band Automatic Man and blues guitarist John Nitzinger, along with Erik Scott and Barry Finnerty. The band, an attempt at Top 40-style rock, released one album, entitled 1:PM, which was released in 1980 in Europe only. Success eluded the album and the band, which broke up shortly thereafter.\n\nMike Oldfield - Five Miles Out\n\nReleased March 19, 1982\n\nRecorded in Buckinghamshire 1981\n\nUK charts #7\n\nCarl is featured on the track \"Mount Teidi\" which is a shorter instrumental piece, named after Mount Teide on the Spanish island of Tenerife.\n\nAsia - Asia\n\nReleased March 1982\n\nRecorded June to November 1981\n\nRecorded at Marcus studios & Virgin Townhouse in London\n\nBillboard charts #1; UK charts #11; Japan charts #15\n\nRIAA 4 times Multi-Platinum\n\nUK Gold\n\nJohn Wetton - vocals, bass\n\nSteve Howe - guitar\n\nGeoff Downes - keyboards\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nThe debut album by Asia reached #1 in the U.S. on the Billboard album charts, and according to Billboard was the best-selling album in the United States for the year 1982. Asia was certified 4x Platinum by the RIAA on February 10, 1995. The album contains the band's biggest hits, \"Here Comes the Feeling\", \"Only Time Will Tell\", \"Sole Survivor\", \"Time Again\", \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Heat of the Moment\", which reached #4 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nAsia - Alpha\n\nReleased July 26 1983\n\nRecorded at Le Studio, Morin Heights, Canada\n\nBillboard charts #6; UK charts #5; Japan charts #4\n\nRIAA Platinum\n\nUK Silver\n\nJohn Wetton - vocals, bass\n\nSteve Howe - guitar\n\nGeoff Downes - keyboards\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nAlpha is Asia's second album with John Wetton as vocalist and last album with Steve Howe as full-time guitarist until 2008's Phoenix. The first track on Alpha, \"Don't Cry\", became a top 10 hit, peaking at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Alpha was certified Platinum by the RIAA on October 11, 1983.\n\nAsia - Astra\n\nReleased august 20, 1985\n\nRecorded 1985\n\nBillboard charts #67; UK charts #68; Japan charts #15\n\nJohn Wetton - vocals, bass\n\nMandy Meyer - guitar\n\nGeoff Downes - keyboards\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nAstra is the last Asia album to feature John Wetton on lead vocals until 2008. After being brought back into the fold for their third album, Wetton and Geoff Downes forged ahead with this effort. Steve Howe, having left sometime before the Astra sessions, was replaced by guitarist Mandy Meyer. Astra peaked at #67 and went largely unnoticed. Wetton left Asia soon after the record's release. Meyer would never play with Asia again. The band itself, after cancelling the Astra tour, was basically finished until 1990.\n\nRoger Daltry - Under a Raging Moon\n\nReleased September 1985\n\nUnder a Raging Moon is Roger's sixth solo album and was issued in September, 1985. It includes several drummers' tributes to Keith Moon, former drummer of The Who who died in 1978. Drummers who perform a tribute on the title track \"Under a Raging Moon\" are (in order): Martin Chambers, Roger Taylor, Cozy Powell, Stewart Copeland, Zak Starkey, Carl Palmer and Mark Brzezicki (joined by Zak in the outro).\n\n3 - To the Power of ...\n\nReleased 1988\n\nRecorded 1987\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards\n\nRobert Berry - guitar, bass, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\n3 were a short-lived progressive rock band formed by Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer) and Berry. Unsurprisingly, their music has elements of the characteristic ELP sound, but was criticized as less inventive and having a bland AOR flavor. 3 did perform live to support their album, in 1988.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Black Moon\n\nReleased June 27, 1992\n\nRecorded 1991 Marcus Studios\n\nBillboard charts #78\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe first studio album under the band's original lineup since 1978, it was regarded by fans as a triumphant comeback.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Live at the Royal Albert Hall\n\nReleased 1993\n\nRecorded October 3, 1992\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nLive at the Royal Albert Hall was recorded at a show at the Royal Albert Hall during the Black Moon tour in October 1992. Highlights of the album include a 9 minute outpouring of \"Tarkus\", \"Black Moon\", and \"Finale\", which is a three song medley. A DVD version of this release is also available, released in early 2009 by Shout! Factory, who has also reissued much of the band's CD catalog.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Live at the Isle of Wight Festival\n\nReleased 1997\n\nRecorded August 29, 1970 on the Isle of Wight\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe show that ELP played at the Isle of Wight on August 29, 1970 was spectacular. Since their first album had not yet been released, the audience was not familiar with their music, but responded with thunderous applause, nonetheless. The Isle of Wight, with its all star lineup that included Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Free, Sly & the Family Stone, was a very unnerving experience for the young band, who certainly rose to the occasion. \"I just remember that we went down like a storm,\" says Palmer. \"The crowd went crazy when we finished.\"\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer - Then and Now\n\nReleased November 24 1998\n\nRecorded April 6, 1974 Ontario Motor Speedway, Ontario, CA and on their 1997/1998 Tour.\n\nKeith Emerson - keyboards, piano\n\nGreg Lake - guitar, bass guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThen and Now is a live album, that brings together two separate periods of the band's career and places them back to back. First is the legendary California Jam performance (\"the Then\"), which took place at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California on 6 April 1974. Second a collection of recordings from the 1997 to 1998 reunion tour (\"the Now\"). Most of the bands best known pieces are present with 'Karn Evil 9: First Impression', 'Take a Pebble' and 'Lucky Man' appearing twice as part of each period's set lists.\n\nQango - Live in the Hood\n\nReleased 2000\n\nRecorded February 3, 2000 at the Robin Hood\n\nJohn Wetton - vocals, bass\n\nJohn Young - keyboards, vocals\n\nDavid Kilminster - guitar, vocals\n\nCarl Palmer - drums\n\nQango was a short-lived progressive rock band, a spin-off from Asia. In 1999, an attempt was made at a partial reunion of the progressive rock supergroup Asia involving John Wetton (bass, vocals) and Carl Palmer (drums), with David Kilminster to be on guitar. The band's live set was based on songs by Asia and Palmer's former band Emerson Lake and Palmer. The band played five UK dates in February 2000 (including a London show on 4 February when Keith Emerson jammed with the band) and six in April 2000. Subsequent touring plans and ideas to record a studio album were abandoned, with Wetton and Palmer soon returning to their solo activities. This recording is from their second show (3 February 2000) and is the band's only official release.\n\nCarl Palmer Anthology - Do ya wanna play, Carl?\n\nReleased 2001\n\nFirst ever compilation for the Emerson, Lake & Palmer drummer. Re-mastered from original tapes. Featuring contributions from the rest of ELP, The Craig, The Chants, Chris Farlow, Atomic Rooster, Mike Oldfield, Asia, 3 and one bonus track, 'Shawnee' with Buddy Rich.\n\nCarl Palmer Band - Working Live, Volume 1\n\nReleased March 17, 2003\n\nShaun Baxter - guitar\n\nDave Marks - bass guitar\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nWorking Live, Volume 1, a new solo album and the first to feature his new solo band. The new trio, simply called Palmer, includes the famous drummer along with bassist Dave Marks and guitarist Shaun Baxter. The record features live interpretations of some of Palmer�s best known songs, originally recorded with ELP and on his solo albums.\n\nCarl Palmer Band - Working Live, Volume 2\n\nReleased 2004\n\nShaun Baxter - guitar\n\nDave Marks - bass guitar\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nThe second live album in a series that features bass-guitar-drums power trio solo band line-up, Working Live Vol. 2 is the sequel to 2003's successful Vol. 1 collection, and again features both new material and new arrangements of long time Palmer classics originally made famous while in Emerson, Lake & Palmer. This album is different than Working Live, Vol. 1: the songs are all different. It was recorded on his 2003 UK tour.\n\nCarl Palmer Band - In Concert (DVD)\n\nReleased 2006\n\nRecorded December 5, 2004\n\nMTV recording at Sports Arena \"Rock in my Heart Festival\" In Bucharest, Romania.\n\nPaul Bielatowicz - guitar\n\nDave Marks - bass guitar\n\nCarl Palmer - drums, percussion\n\nAsia, featuring members of Yes, ELP and King Crimson, was the first \"supergroup\" of the eighties.

Working Live, Volume 3 goes beyond the title of \"live album\" - this is a listening experience. This album cover reflects the background imagery of the artist, William Neal, who was also the artist for the Tarkus and Pictures at an Exhibition album covers.\n\nCarl Palmer - Drum Solos (DVD)\n\nReleased 22 February 2011\n\nby Music VIdeo Distributors (MVD)"
