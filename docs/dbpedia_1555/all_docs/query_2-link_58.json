Almost everybody loves the fall season as football begins and the relief of these hot summer days.\n\nStates That Want to Get Rid of Daylight Savings Time\n\nThere have been a lot of states that are trying to get rid of Daylight Savings Time including California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Washington and West Virginia. Arizona and Hawaii are the only two states that don't recognize Daylight Saving Time.\n\nTo Stay in Daylight Savings or Not to Stay\n\nOther states would love to stay in Day Light Saving Time all year including Arkansas. Texas was on board about 10 years ago until they realized that if they did stay in Daylight Savings Time and the other states didn't there would be one major problem. Sunday's church time could conflict with Dallas Cowboys games. At least they have their priorities straight.\n\nWhy Haven't States Gone to Daylight Savings Time Permanently?\n\nClose to 18 states want to remain in daylight savings and have bills that have passed. So why aren't they in that time all year yet? The problem with going this way is that a federal law prevents it. Congress has to change that law before any state can stay permanently in Daylight Saving Time.\n\nAccording to TheHill.com,\n\nUnder the Uniform Time Act of 1966, states can exempt themselves from daylight saving time by observing permanent standard time year-round, but they cannot observe permanent daylight saving time all year.\n\nNothing is ever easy. So with that all said...\n\nWhen Will Daylight Savings Time End This Year?\n\nGet ready to change our clocks back to Standard Time (remember the phrase 'Fall Back, Spring Forward') on Sunday, November 3. Well, at least we'll all have that extra hour of sleep back in time for the election."
