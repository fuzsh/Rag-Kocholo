        "text": "We have already written about the tragic death of the popular drummer Cozy Powell, because he was a Saab car lover, and just once a Saab 9000 Turbo was tragically killed. And now, thanks to the article published in the magazine “Grunge”, we have learned the details of the circumstances of this tragic accident.\n\nCozy Powell, the iconic rock drummer, tragically passed away in a car accident while driving his Saab 9000 Turbo at a high speed of 104 mph (167km/h). His girlfriend, who was on the phone with him at the time of the crash, heard the tragic event unfold. Powell’s untimely death was a shock to the music industry, as he was known for his incredible talent and skill behind the drums.\n\nHe had played with some of the biggest names in rock music, including Black Sabbath, Rainbow, and Whitesnake. In addition to providing a tribute to Powell, this article also serves as a reminder for readers to practice safe driving habits and to always be aware of the potential risks on the road.\n\nCozy was driving on the M4 motorway near Bristol, England, when the tragic accident occurred. He was on the phone with his girlfriend, Reeve, at the time of the crash. Reeve heard Powell mention that he couldn’t find fifth gear and then heard a loud noise followed by Powell saying “oh s***.” She immediately knew something was wrong and attempted to call him back, but when he didn’t pick up, she contacted the police. According to the BBC, Powell was pronounced dead at a local hospital in Bristol. He was only 50 years old at the time of his death. The New York Times reported that an inquest later revealed that Powell had crashed while driving at a high speed of 104 mph.\n\nThe accident occurred when one of the car’s rear tires blew out causing Powell to lose control of the vehicle. The Saab hit a curb, rolled, and landed on its roof, with one witness saying he saw the vehicle “cartwheeling.” It was reported that Powell was not wearing a seatbelt (!) and was legally drunk at the time of the accident.\n\nCar enthusiasts used the video game “BeamNG.Drive” to recreate the tragic event involving Cozy and his Saab 9000. In the game BeamNG Drive, players can experience the thrill of driving in a highly realistic and dynamic environment. The game’s soft body engine also allows for realistic damage and destruction.\n\nBeamNG Drive is not only a game but also a physics sandbox that allows players to experiment and create their own scenarios. They can design and build their own tracks, vehicles, and scenarios, and share them with the community. You can see the result of one such simulation below:\n\nPowell’s love for speed and fast cars was no secret, as he once said, “I drive like I drum — madly.” Though it’s not clear what year the Saab 9000 Turbo Powell was driving was made, but that the 1991 model could go 60 mph in 6.4 seconds.\n\nPowell’s legacy lives on through his music and the countless fans who continue to be inspired by his talent. He was not only a gifted musician but also a skilled race car driver, as he often competed in high-speed races. However, his love for speed ultimately led to his untimely death.\n\nAs fans remember Cozy Powell, it is important to note the dangers of reckless driving and the importance of road safety. Tragically losing such a talented musician serves as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of being cautious on the road. Powell’s music and contributions to the rock genre will always be remembered and cherished."
