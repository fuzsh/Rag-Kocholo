        "text": "“I’ve been really, really into music since I was about eight years old, but when I first heard a BLACK SABBATH record, that was it – there was nothing else,” Bordin said. “The very next week, on April 6, 1974, I saw them on TV on the ‘California Jam’. It was the most compelling, the most exciting, the most physical thing that I had ever seen – it was a revelation. I remember Bill as this big, crazy, giant hairy dude with red tights and no shirt. By the middle of the first song, you couldn’t see him – it was just hair and flailing arms. “When you look at Bill’s style of playing, you have to look at it in the context of the giants around him. Geezer, Tony and Ozzy are like forces of nature, and to balance in between them and not be squished, you have to be a giant as well. “Bill’s playing is phenomenally individual and completely unique – nobody can play those songs like him. I was raised on BLACK SABBATH music and it was hugely important to me even before I started playing drums. “Bill Ward is a prince of a human being and I feel honored to have had a chance to play in BLACK SABBATH with Ozzy, Tony and Geezer. It was my tribute to the man that wasn’t onstage, but should have been.”\n\nDate Location Venue Other Bands / Openers Notes May 24 1997 First gig on Ozzfest ’97 Tour May 24 1997 Bristow, VA Nissan Pavillion at Stone Ridge Billed as Washington, DC May 26 1997 West Palm Beach, FL Coral Sky Amphitheater May 28 1997 Charlotte, NC Blockbuster Pavillion May 31 1997 San Antonio, TX The Alamodome Jun 01 1997 Dallas, TX Coca Cola Starplex Amphitheater [ Concert Reviews ] Jun 03 1997 Cuyahoga Falls, OH Blossom Music Center Billed as Cleveland, OH Jun 04 1997 Noblesville, IN Deer Creek Amphitheater Billed as Indianapolis, IN Jun 06 1997 Camden, NJ Tweeter Center Billed as Philadelphia, PA – 2nd Show after Jun 8 sold out Jun 07 1997 Burgettstown, PA Post-Gazette Pavilion Billed as Pittsburgh, PA Jun 08 1997 Camden, NJ Tweeter Center Billed as Philadelphia, PA Jun 10 1997 Maryland Heights, MO Riverport Amphitheater Billed as St. Louis, MO Jun 12 1997 Clarkston, MI Pine Knob Music Theater Billed as Detroit, MI Jun 14 1997 Mansfield, MA Great Woods Center [ Concert Reviews ] Jun 15 1997 East Rutheford, NJ Giants Stadium Jun 17 1997 Columbus, OH Polaris Amphitheater Rescheduled to July 1 Jun 19 1997 Tinley Park, IL World Amphitheater Billed as Chicago, IL Jun 21 1997 East Troy, WI Alpine Valley Music Theater Billed as Milwaukee, WI Jun 22 1997 Minneapolis, MN Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome Jun 24 1997 Denver, CO Mile High Stadium Jun 26 1997 Phoenix, AZ Desert Sky Amphitheater Jun 28 1997 Las Vegas, NV Sam Boyd Silverbowl / “Thomas & Mack Center”?
