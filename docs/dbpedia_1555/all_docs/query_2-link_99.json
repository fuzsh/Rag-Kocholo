U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. AND THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD ---------- WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2014 U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:39 p.m., in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Claire McCaskill, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE McCASKILL, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI Senator McCaskill. The Committee will come to order. Today we will hear from individuals nominated by the President to fill three positions critical to transportation safety and policy. We have Mr. Carlos Monje, nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Transportation. Mr. Monje is currently Counselor to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, a role in which he works on the Administration's proposal to reauthorize the surface transportation programs on the TIGER discretionary grant program and on efforts to promote equity and economic development. Mr. Monje previously served as a Senior Policy Adviser and Chief of Staff at the White House Domestic Policy Council, where he worked on a wide variety of domestic policy issues. If confirmed for this position, Mr. Monje will play a critical role in working across the Executive Branch and with Congress in the coming months as we look to renewing expiring authorizations for surface transportation aviation and rail programs. We also have Dr. Tho Bella Dinh-Zarr. Is it Dinh-Zarr or Dinh-Zarr? Nominated to serve as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board, she will bring valuable surface transportation experience of the Board. Currently Dr. Dinh-Zarr is the Director of the U.S. Office of the FIA Foundation, an international philanthropy dedicated to promoting safe and sustainable transportation. In previous positions, she has worked at the American Automobile Association, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Texas Transportation Institute. If confirmed for this position, Dr. Dinh-Zarr will fill a vacancy on the five-person safety board charged with determining the proper cause of transportation accidents and making recommendations to improve transportation safety. And, finally, we have Dr. Mark Rosekind, nominated to serve as Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Since 2010, Dr. Rosekind has served as a Member of the NTSB. He is considered a leading expert on human fatigue, having published more than 150 scholarly articles and having founded Alertness Solutions, a scientific consulting firm that specializes in fatigue management. Prior to that, Dr. Rosekind directed the Fatigue Countermeasures Program at the Nassau Ames Research Center, was Chief of Aviation Operations Branch in the Flight Management and Human Factors Division, and served as the Director of the Center for Human Sleep Research at Stanford University's Sleep Disorders and Research Center. This committee and the Consumer Protection Subcommittee have held four hearings this year alone looking at NHTSA's ability to effectively identify defects and exercise its enforcement authority over the industries that it regulates. Through investigations into defects, General Motors' ignition switch and Takata airbags, we examined industry's compliance with Federal safety laws and the agency's capacity to ensure that cars on the road are safe to drive. I think it's safe to say that I speak for many members on both sides of the aisle when I say we were pleased to see the President submit a nominee for this position after calls from many of us to fill this important position that has been without a confirmed Administrator for nearly a year. NHTSA faces a number of challenges, significant challenges, in the coming months and years as it works to catch up to an auto industry that has far outpaced it with technology. And Congress has a role to play in ensuring the agency has the resources, both financial and technical, to do its job. I look forward to hearing from Dr. Rosekind today about his plans for leading this agency and restoring confidence in its ability to protect the driving public. I hope that if the Members of this committee get the answers they are looking for today, we can move forward in the coming days with quickly confirming these nominees. Welcome to all of our witnesses, and I look forward to hearing your testimony. Senator Thune. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator McCaskill, for agreeing to chair this hearing to consider the nominations of Mark Rosekind to be the next Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Bella Dinh-Zarr to be a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Carlos Monje to be Assistant Secretary of Policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. I appreciate the willingness of these nominees to serve the Nation in what are very important roles. As I stated in our hearing last month regarding faulty Takata airbags, the string of recalls this year has been cause for grave concern. We are on pace to have the all-time worst year for auto recalls in U.S. history, with roughly 56 million vehicles being subject to recall so far. In many of these cases, there are legitimate questions about whether NHTSA should have identified the defective products earlier and communicated more effectively with the public. That is why Dr. Rosekind will face substantial challenges at NHTSA should he be confirmed. Since the start of the year, I called on President Obama to nominate a qualified individual to lead without NHTSA without delay because inaction sends a terrible signal to the regulated community and the American people about automobile safety and oversight. In March of this year, over 8 months ago, as the Nation began to fully realize the severity of the problems at General Motors with regard to certain ignition switch defects, I wrote a letter to the President calling on him to nominate a new administrator for NHTSA as quickly as possible. I never received a response. In September, I sent a second letter to the President, stressing the urgency for NHTSA to have a Senate-confirmed leader as the agency dealt with the GM recalls as well as serious allegations information had been withheld from the agency by GM. In September, Senators Heller, McCaskill, the leaders of our Consumer Protection Subcommittee that oversees NHTSA, also both called on the President to nominate a new NHTSA administrator without delay. Unfortunately, President Obama didn't formally nominate a new NHTSA administrator until the evening before this committee's hearing on Takata airbags, on November 20. By contrast, this committee is moving swiftly to consider this nomination. Dr. Rosekind has served as a Member of the NTSB since 2009. His has experiences in the developing countermeasures for fatigue in order to enhance vehicle safety. He served at NASA for a number of years and founded a technology company aimed at creating software that helps to reduce the role of fatigue and traffic incidents. NHTSA's mission is safety. And that is paramount to all of us. I will be asking Dr. Rosekind how his experience at NHTSA and academia and in the private sector can be translated to managing an agency that many perceive to be in crisis. I will also be asking Dr. Rosekind how his expertise in fatigue and impaired driving can be utilized to lead an agency that is much different than the NTSB. I believe that NHTSA must have a leader that can hit the ground running. I will also be asking Dr. Rosekind about his familiarity with NHTSA and, in particular, about the administration's ongoing top-to-bottom review of NHTSA reported in the New York Times. I want to know how Dr. Rosekind will be involved in this top-to-bottom review of NHTSA should he be confirmed. If he is confirmed, Dr. Rosekind will be departing from the NTSB. And Dr. Bella Dinh-Zarr has been nominated to take over the vacancy at NTSB left by the departure of Deborah Hersman, who stepped down as Chairman earlier this year. Dr. Dinh-Zarr has a solid record as a traffic safety advocate, a compelling personal life story that includes escaping Vietnam as a small child as the Communists took over the country. The NTSB plays an important role in highway, aviation, and other modes of transportation safety. I look forward to hearing from Dr. Dinh- Zarr about what she would seek to prioritize at the NTSB should she be confirmed. And, finally, Dr. Carlos Monje has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Transportation. I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Monje when he accompanied Secretary Foxx during his visit to South Dakota last month. I very much appreciated the Secretary's time and seeing firsthand a host of the transportation challenges that exist in a rural state like South Dakota. And I am glad that Mr. Monje was able to come to South Dakota. Among other things, I will be asking Mr. Monje about his views on issues regarding changes in the department's TIGER grant review process and other issues facing the DOT as we approach the expiration of the MAP-21 extension that runs out on May 31 of next year. Thank you again, Madam Chair, for holding this important hearing, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Senator McCaskill. Thank you, Senator Thune. We'll begin with you, Dr. Rosekind. We look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF DR. MARK R. ROSEKIND, MEMBER, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD; NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, ADMINISTRATOR-DESIGNATE Dr. Rosekind. Senator McCaskill, Ranking Member Thune, members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you today as the nominee for administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I would like to thank President Obama for this nomination and Secretary Foxx for his support in my selection. Before I begin, let me introduce some very special people that are joining me today. My wife, Dr. Debra Babcock, is here. She always provides unwavering support and has enriched my life for over 30 years. Our son, Aaron, and his new bride, Dr. Madalyn Radlauer, are viewing from Minneapolis; and our daughter, Eve, is watching from Baltimore. My mother, Marilyn, and mother-in-law, Lila Babcock, are viewing at home in the San Francisco Bay area. And my family really is a remarkable gift and a constant source of strength in my life. Professionally, former NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman and my other NTSB colleagues, many of them here today, have really been tremendous partners, passionate about enhancing transportation safety. NHTSA touches all of our lives in some way every day. As drivers, passengers, pedestrians, or bicyclists, NHTSA's mission is to help keep all of us safe as we move about our nation's roadways. The agency's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce the economic costs of crashes, but in 2012, 33,561 lives were lost and 2.36 million individuals were injured in crashes on America's roads. These are the 2.4 million reasons why roadway safety must always be a national priority and constantly improved. The numbers actually become staggering when considering over the past decade how they have grown. Of course, the actual toll is much higher when realizing that each one of these individuals has a family, friends, coworkers, classmates, and others, whose lives are also changed forever. It is the personal, human, and individual costs that should be foremost in our minds as we discuss NHTSA's safety mission. This discussion must acknowledge how much NHTSA's hard work has already made our roadways safer. The opportunity to protect lives now and in the future is certainly what drives the safety professionals at NHTSA. It is through their efforts, in collaboration with many others across the country, that we have made significant safety achievements over the past 60 years with fatalities on the roadways reaching their lowest level since 1950. Although much still needs to be done, in many respects, NHTSA has led the world in building data-driven processes that have sparked the advancement of safety technologies and systems contributing to this tremendous decline. NHTSA pursues its safety mission through programs that recognize the complexity of human behavior, the evolution of automotive engineering, and innovations in technology. Core safety programs establish a foundation for crash prevention and survivability while regulation and enforcement provide crucial safety standards. This includes identifying defects and recalls, developing educational materials and activities that touch every segment of our society, improvement of fuel efficiency and emissions, the EMS system, and so much more. NHTSA leverages this diverse portfolio to enhance safety, though it is always critical to ensure that resources and authority align with mission and expectations. This must be balanced with the need for ongoing efforts to identify and pursue actions that will constantly improve the agency's effectiveness in meeting its objectives. If confirmed, I plan to apply my knowledge, experience, and passion for safety to NHTSA's crucial safety mission. The NTSB shares the same safety objectives as NHTSA, which is to save lives and prevent injuries. And for the past four and a half years as an NTSB board member, it has been my privilege to pursue accident investigations, issue safety recommendations, and undertake advocacy efforts that make our transportation system safer. As a scientist, I developed an analytical, data- driven approach to examining problems and becoming an expert in human fatigue that is relevant to safety in all environments. While at NASA, I expanded my field of knowledge into varied human factors arenas and translated that science into effective solutions that address operational problems in safety-critical environments. Work in the private sector provided invaluable lessons in developing innovative solutions to complex, challenging, real-world safety problems. I recognize that my nomination to lead NHTSA comes at a pivotal juncture. If confirmed, you have my commitment that I will maintain an aggressive focus on continuing to improve NHTSA's safety record and ensuring that NHTSA's regulatory regime is current for today's safety environment. To this task, I will bring a fresh set of eyes and a different perspective honed over the years as a safety professional and manager at NASA, the NTSB, and in the private sector. Chairman, in closing, safety has also been a very personal priority for me since my earliest days. My father was a San Francisco police officer, who was killed in the line of duty when a driver ran a red light. And through this single and profound event in my own life, I share in the individual and personal stories of so many people who have been affected by preventable tragedy on our roadways. I thank you again for your consideration of my nomination to serve as NHTSA Administrator. And I look forward to your questions.

The experience and knowledge obtained through my direct involvement in this broad range of safety efforts can be directly applied to the programs and challenges at NHTSA. For example, I have led NTSB advocacy efforts related to substance impaired driving and fatigue, including the creation of stakeholder coalitions, chaired a drowsy driving forum, and provided numerous presentations to diverse audiences. As a Board Member, my responsibilities include the final determination of accident probable cause and deciding what safety recommendations are issued to prevent future occurrences. During my term, we have addressed a broad range of roadway safety issues, including distraction, fatigue, crashworthiness, seat belts, survival factors, regulatory oversight, medical conditions, graduated licensing, and training issues. The NTSB multi-modal perspective further adds to a fresh safety approach that can guide, create and implement enhanced efforts at NHTSA. (b) Innovative leadership in academics, NASA, and private sector. Whether growing a NASA program to international significance or opening new opportunities to effectively apply fatigue management in diverse settings worldwide, my professional focus has been to enact innovative solutions to challenging safety issues. This has required a strong scientific foundation, appreciation for real-world, practical challenges and operations, an ability to translate technical information into clear and meaningful communications, and to ensure the effectiveness of activities and programs. All of the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired throughout my career can directly advance NHTSA's safety mission. (c) Safety focus and scientific expertise. My entire professional career has been focused on enhancing safety. Even my earliest academic-based research efforts involved applied issues intended to improve safety. Therefore, my fundamental worldview involves actions needed to make the world a safer place. This is reflected in the scientific expertise that I have developed over the course of my career, including fatigue (sleep and circadian rhythms), human factors, psychology/ behavior change, and human performance. Given that 94 percent of all traffic crashes involve human factors, my expertise is relevant to addressing the core safety issues encompassed by NHTSA. All of this expertise is rooted in a scientific-based, data-driven approach to understanding problems and seeking solutions. My fundamental focus on safety and particular areas of scientific expertise are all relevant to NHTSA's safety mission. (d) Why serve in the position? To enhance safety. Enhancing safety means saving lives, preventing injuries, and eliminating crashes. The NTSB has been a remarkable experience with so many opportunities to make a safety difference. Leading an operating modal administration represents a different opportunity to enhance safety. NHTSA is where safety programs get created and implemented, regulations are generated and enforced to protect the traveling public, and diverse informational resources guide and inform all of us. NHTSA is, literally, where the rubber meets the road and offers diverse, meaningful opportunities to enhance safety for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. For example, one area that holds tremendous safety potential is technology. Automated vehicle technologies are currently available to warn about lane deviations, blind spots, forward collisions, and more. Future technology innovations may lead to autonomous vehicles that make substance impaired driving, distraction, and fatigue obsolete safety risks. NHTSA can help to lead the discussion and incentivize the solutions that will translate current and future technology innovations into greater safety on our roadways. 19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large organization? If confirmed as Administrator, I will have ultimate responsibility to ensure that NHTSA has proper management and accounting controls in place and functioning effectively. These areas deserve an in-depth examination and, where needed, innovation to enhance these functions to reach optimal effectiveness. The same critical evaluation applied to NHTSA's safety activities should be used in these areas to identity where improvements in management and accounting controls will support the agency's safety mission. My management experience includes my time as Chief of the Aviation Operations Branch in the Flight Management and Human Factors Division at NASA Ames Research Center, with direct oversight of 60 scientists, researchers, and administrative personnel, including budget and operational responsibilities. During my tenure as the Team Leader of the Fatigue Countermeasures Program in the Aviation Safety Research Branch at NASA Ames Research Center, I created and led multiple international coalitions conducting research, addressing policies, and collaborating on projects. As a Board Member at the NTSB, my advocacy efforts have included leading the creation of a stakeholders coalition to address substance-impaired driving. While my experience has provided a variety of management opportunities with diverse groups, it does not include an organization the size of NHTSA. 20. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the department/agency, and why? (a) Improving oversight, defect identification, investigation, and recall processes. Recent events clearly demonstrate that the current processes related to defect oversight, collection and analysis of complaints, investigating defects, and recall procedures require an in-depth examination, improvement, and innovation. All levels of the process should be examined to determine if and where greater transparency could enhance safety. Information accuracy, clear communication, and coordination need to be evaluated for their roles in improving this process. Direct interactions with automakers are critical to establishing expectations and emphasizing requirements, including the consequences and potential penalties for inaction, slowed or incomplete responses. The full range of NHTSA's authority and tools should be applied to require and enforce needed safety measures. There is an immediate need to address the current recall situation, as well as a near-term need to address the full defect-recall process. These efforts should go beyond just 'fixing' the current situation and involve improvements and innovations that represent the future of roadway safety. These efforts must be considered in the context of NHTSA's mission requirements given the agency's current resources and authority. It will be critical to determine how resources (e.g., personnel, funding, training) and authority will need to be increased for the agency to effectively meet its mission requirements and expectations. Most importantly, the NHTSA safety mission must be paramount: save lives and prevent injuries. As these issues are examined and changed, safety should be the guiding principle. (b) Core safety program innovations. NHTSA maintains a core set of legacy safety programs that must be maintained and will potentially grow as new issues emerge. These core safety efforts that focus on seat belt use, car seats, substance impaired driving, distraction, pedestrian and bicyclist safety, school buses, motorcycles, and much more remain the foundation for driver, passenger, and vehicle safety. These efforts must continue and would benefit from innovative enhancements because of their fundamental role in roadway safety. The ever- increasing information overload of modern society creates a challenge for these core safety programs and they must be meaningful and innovative if they are going to be effective. There is a need to bring new ideas and approaches to these core programs so that the safety messages grab attention and lead to actions that will make a difference. These same challenges confront safety and health advocates outside transportation, where their successes in changing and maintaining behavior can inform and guide innovations in these core NHTSA programs. (c) The Future: Technology innovations. NHTSA data show that human error accounts for 94 percent of traffic crashes, and there are ongoing efforts to introduce technology solutions to reduce or eliminate these vulnerabilities. There are automated vehicle technologies available today that can dramatically reduce these human error related crashes. Forward collision warning systems, automatic braking, blind spot monitoring, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are only a few examples of these technologies. Future innovations may lead to self- driving vehicles that are fully autonomous. These current and future innovations need to be discussed, explored, built, evaluated, evolved, and implemented if their potential is to be fully realized. It will be exciting to see current automated vehicle technologies and future innovations integrated into a roadway safety system for drivers, vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. NHTSA can lead the technology innovation discussions, incentivize development and adoption, and maintain a clear focus on the safety objectives and requirements of new technology. b. potential conflicts of interest 1.
