        "text": "Just over a week ago, we lost the marvelous Gordon Lightfoot, a Canadian singer-songwriter who has had a significant impact on the world of music, in general, and on me, in particular. His career spanned over six decades, during which he has produced a vast body of work that has inspired and influenced generations of musicians and songwriters.\n\nThe music of Gordon Lightfoot can be described as a blend of folk, country, and pop styles, characterized by his distinctive baritone voice, intricate guitar work, and thoughtful lyrics. It was the lyrics of Lightfoot's songs are the hallmark of his music. He is known for his ability to write deeply personal and introspective lyrics that explore the universal themes of love (“If You Could Read My Mind”), loss (“Race Among the Ruins”), and the beauty of nature (“Spanish Moss”). His lyrics were often poetic and used vivid imagery to create powerful emotional connections with his listeners.\n\nHe could spin tales of real events like the melancholy “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.” That song told the story of the loss of the cargo ship Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in 1975. Much like Bob Dylan’s “Hurricane,” the song took some poetic license with the actual facts of the story but it riveted a nation—in fact, two nations including Canada—with the story. He built on the universal fascination with ships lost at sea. Think of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “The Wreck of the Hesperides” or Gerard Manly Hopkins’ “The Wreck of the Deutschland” or the movies concerning the Titanic.\n\nBut that song only built on his own growing fame and reputation. It started long before 1975’s “Wreck…” And, if I am entirely honest, “…Edmund Fitzgerald” was one of my least favorite of his works.\n\n​\n\nI was sitting watching TV in 1965. Mom and Dad had gone to bed and I woke up to watch “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” Carson introduced me to much of the music that I still love today and, that night, Gordon Lightfoot performed “Early Morning Rain.” It remains one of my favorite pieces. Four years later, 1969, he was on “Hullaballoo” performing “For Lovin’ Me.” I thought he was even better.\n\nOf course, at 10 years of age, I still had no money of my own, so I didn’t buy any records yet. In fact, my first album I bought with my own money was “In-a-Gadda-da-Vida” by the Iron Butterfly—a far cry from Gordon Lightfoot. But in 1972, a local station in Miami re-ran a Gordon Lightfoot concert from the BBC and I first heard “Summer Side Of Life” and “Minstrel Of The Dawn” and several others. At the same time, the radios were playing lots of his big hit, “If You Could Read My Mind.” By this time, I was mowing lawns for money and buying my own records.\n\nI went to The Tape Deck a record store in my home town, a place I would later work, and bought the albums “Sit Down Young Stranger” on “Don Quixote.” I admit, I was drawn to “Don Quixote” because I had just read “Don Quixote” by Miguel de Cervantes and was intrigued to hear the musical interpretation. What I was not prepared to hear and experience was the song “Beautiful”—to this day my favorite Gordon Lightfoot song.\n\n“At times I just don't know\n\nHow you could be anything but beautiful\n\nI think that I was made for you\n\nAnd you were made for me”\n\nI was only 14 years old but this song put a vision and a longing in my head that would not be fulfilled until 2019, when I married Nicole. Almost 47 years later.\n\nI got to see him in concert in Cincinnati, Ohio, in September 1980. He was at the height of his popularity and creativity. He was marvelous.\n\nMany years and many albums later, in 2002, Gordon Lightfoot suffered a near-fatal ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, similar to the condition that took the life of actor John Ritter. He withstood six weeks in a coma, four surgeries, and two years of extensive rehab. His first extensive tour did not happen again until 2005.\n\nHe then suffered a minor stroke in 2006 that temporarily affected his ability to play guitar but he continued touring. Ten years later, he performed 80 concerts and told The Canadian Press, “At this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can.”\n\nIn an interview with the CBC in 2004, Lightfoot had said that he wanted to be like Willie Nelson and “Just do it for as long as humanly possible.” Then in April of this year, he announced that he was canceling all his scheduled concerts for health reasons.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, however, I finally got to take Nicole to see him at the Grand Theater in Wausau, WI. He struggled with his voice, often missing a note or a lyric here and there. But it was Gordon Lightfoot.\n\n​\n\nHe played many of his great and best-known songs. But one was missing. He returned for a sing-song encore and, sitting with Nicole and holding her hand, he wonderfully performed “Beautiful.” The last words fading out,\n\n“And I must say it means so much to me\n\nTo be the one who's telling you,\n\nI'm telling you,\n\nThat you're beautiful”\n\n​\n\nFarewell, Gordon Lightfoot. Thanks for giving me the vision of what life and love could be.\n\n​I know that I write a lot about the passing of famous musicians. Many of them you may have never heard of or certainly do not care about. But I always feel like their passing is the occasion to reflect on what they contributed to the world of music or art or literature to me, personally.\n\nOne of my favorite bands growing up was The Moody Blues. They weren't the exquisite musicians compared to bands like Yes or King Crimson or most anybody you care to name in the Jazz world. But their music was sometimes philosophical, always meditative, often whimsical.\n\nGraeme Edge was their drummer. In fact, he was one of the founding members of the band. He was a fine drummer, a light hearted and fun loving character, but he turned out to be quite a remarkable poet. Truth be told, I think it was his poetic interludes in their various albums that attracted me to the band in the first place.\n\nWhen he died last week, he was the only remaining original member of the band and had played his last concert with them in September of 2019. That year, age and illness began to take its toll and he retired from performing. With his retirement, the two remaining members—Justin Hayward and John Lodge—decided that the Moody Blues could not continue. They are now touring separately.\n\nGraeme was born in Rocester, England on March 30, 1941. He had performed with various startup bands in the early 1960s but, in 1964, he became a founding member of The Moody Blues. He provided a solid foundation for the original R&B and Rock flavored band, fronted by Denny Laine, playing on all their Decca singles, including the UK chart topping \"Go Now\" (January 1965), and other 1965 hit songs; \"I Don't Want To Go On Without You\", \"Everyday\", and \"From The Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)\", which were additionally released in that same year.\n\nAfter the departure of Denny Laine (who would eventually wind up with Paul McCartney & Wings) and bassist Clint Warwick. Graeme was integral in the recruitment of Justin Hayward and John Lodge in 1966. While the band continued to play the R&B style material, a tirade from a fan led to some soul-searching. Graeme said, “'That guy was right...we were rubbish!” This retrospection led the band to decide to abandon the Blues style covers and begin writing and recording their own songs, exclusively.\n\nGraeme initially was a poet for the band contributing Morning Glory and Late Lament to the Days of Future Passed album in 1967 (although the poem was narrated by Mike Pinder). If you’ve ever heard the extended version of Nights in White Satin, you have heard Graeme’s poem.\n\nBreathe deep the gathering gloom,\n\nWatch lights fade from every room.\n\nBedsitter people look back and lament,\n\nAnother day's useless energy spent.\n\nImpassioned lovers wrestle as one.\n\nLonely man cries for love and has none.\n\nNew mother picks up and suckles her son.\n\nSenior citizens wish they were young.\n\nCold-hearted orb that rules the night\n\nRemoves the colours from our sight.\n\nRed is grey and yellow white,\n\nBut we decide which is right\n\nAnd which is an illusion.\n\nEdge himself opened In Search of the Lost Chord (1968) with his brief poem Departure although Pinder again narrated his The Word poem later on that set. Further poems provided by Edge included In The Beginning (co-narrated by Justin Hayward, Graeme Edge, and Mike Pinder in turn), and The Dream (spoken by Mike Pinder) for On The Threshold of A Dream (1969).\n\nLater in 1969, as The Moody Blues launched their own label Threshold Records, Edge began contributing songs, his Higher And Higher (a spoken lyric over music with a dramatic rocket blast off opening) commenced the album To Our Children's Children's Children, which also featured his instrumental composition Beyond.\n\nEdge 'whispered' the lyrics to his song Don't You Feel Small over the band’s sung vocals on A Question of Balance (1970) on which he also contributed a co-written with Ray Thomas closing poem/song The Balance. This was the poem that always got me somehow. When I got to see them perform in 1982, I was thrilled to see them perform that song. The lights were low and a single spotlight was on Graeme as he sat at his drum kit. His arms were folded across his drums sticks and he began to recite, so sweetly,\n\nAfter he had journeyed,\n\nAnd his feet were sore,\n\nAnd he was tired,\n\nHe came upon an orange grove\n\nAnd he rested.\n\nAnd he lay in the cool,\n\nAnd while he rested,\n\nHe took to himself an orange\n\nAnd tasted it,\n\nAnd it was good.\n\nAnd he felt the earth to his spine,\n\nAnd he asked,\n\nAnd he saw the tree above him,\n\nAnd the stars,\n\nAnd the veins in the leaf,\n\nAnd the light,\n\nAnd the balance.\n\nAnd he saw magnificent perfection,\n\nWhereon he thought of himself in balance,\n\nAnd he knew he was.\n\nThe thing is, when I first heard that song, my friend Jimmy and I were eating oranges at that very moment. We paused, after we heard that line about tasting the orange, and just looked at each other. To this day, hearing recordings of Graeme reciting that poem that he and Ray Thomas wrote, gives me a thrill.\n\nNext came the band’s album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour in 1971, on which his song, After You Came, featured the four lead vocalists—Ray Thomas, Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge—all together and taking brief solo lead lines in turn.\n\nFor their 1972 Seventh Sojourn album, Edge co-wrote You And Me with Justin Hayward who took lead vocal. In 2013, Graeme said of Seventh Sojourn: \"I didn't listen to that album, because I was going through a divorce at the same time and so it was very, very painful for me. Once it was finished, I didn't play it for years and years and years. Never played it. Not that I play our stuff very much anyway but I never ever played that one. And I hadn't really heard it apart from the singles from it, until much later when it came out first time on CD and I had to listen to it digitalized, just to sort of say 'Yeah, that's fine by me.' And I thought, 'Well actually, that's not too bad an album!' That's the closest I'll ever be to hearing a Moody Blues album for the first time.\"\n\nAfter The Moody Blues' world tour ended in 1974, the band members took a break with all the members of the band releasing solo albums or duet albums (as in the case of John and Justin, calling themselves the Blue Jays). They were all really quite good. At least, to me.\n\n​\n\n​Graeme formed his studio-based The Graeme Edge Band (featuring guitarist/vocalist Adrian Gurvitz) who first issued a non-album single We Like To Do It in July 1974. The Graeme Edge Band then released two albums in the mid-1970s. The first was Kick Off Your Muddy Boots in September 1975. It featured Adrian Gurvitz and Paul Gurvitz, plus a guest appearance co-drumming with Graeme by Ginger Baker (of Cream, Blind Faith, and Ginger Baker’s Air Force) with backing vocals by fellow Moodies member Ray Thomas. This first album reached No. 107 in the USA on the Billboard chart. Their second album was 'Paradise Ballroom' in 1977, charting in the USA reaching No. 164 on the Billboard chart. It was also featured Adrian and Paul Gurvitz.\n\nAfter The Moody Blues' reunion in 1978, Graeme provided the strong I'll Be Level With You (sung by the group, led by Justin Hayward) for the album Octave. When it came time to sign the touring contracts, co-founder and keyboardist Mike Pinder just couldn’t sign. He couldn’t face the crowds, the media, everything, and he bowed out of the band—the first band member to quit since 1966. The band hired (ex-Refugee and ex-Yes) keyboardist Patrick Moraz to take Pinder’s spot.\n\nFor Long Distance Voyager in 1981, Graeme contributed the song 22,000 Days—the length of an average human lifespan in days–sung by Ray Thomas, John Lodge, and Justin Hayward. Graeme’s heartfelt Going Nowhere (sung by Ray Thomas) was his lone composition on The Present album in 1983, and he teamed with Moodies keyboardist Patrick Moraz for The Spirit (sung by the group's vocalists in harmony) on The Other Side of Life album in 1986.\n\nEdge was not featured as a songwriter or poet on either Sur La Mer (1988) or Keys of the Kingdom (1991), and was not drummer on every track on the latter album. However, he did contribute the thought-provoking closing poem/song Nothing Changes which was initially narrated by himself, then sung by The Moody Blues (Justin Hayward featured) on the Strange Times album issued in 1999.\n\nBeginning in 1991, Gordon Marshall was co-drummer for the Moodies concerts. Rock and Roll drumming is tough on wrists and Graeme was no exception. Still, Graeme’s drumming style was instantly recognizable and most distinctive.\n\nHis divorce had taken a heavy toll on him, emotionally. He finally fell in love again but said that his girlfriend Susan would not marry him because she did not want to be named Sue Edge (sewage). He was a big fan of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. An article about him said he has \"plenty of time for overseeing some rental properties, doing charity work, playing lots of golf and watching Deep Space Nine at his Sarasota home on Florida's Gulf Coast.\"\n\nTo date, the Moody Blues have sold more than 70 million album, In 2018, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The song Nights in White Satin has been covered more than 140 times.\n\nGraeme died on Thursday, November 11, 2021. He was 80 years old.\n\n​Just a small example of what Graeme and the Moody Blues mean to our household, Nicole had no idea what I was writing just now. She walked in and started playing the Moody Blues.\n\nFor fans of drummers, the last week was a heartbreaking one. Two of the premier drummers of the 1960s Rock scene died, leaving music fans grief-stricken and in disbelief.\n\nLast Tuesday, August 24, the great Charlie Watts died with no cause of death yet released. He was 80 years old. On Sunday, August 29, Ron Bushy passed away from esophageal cancer at the age of 79.\n\nRon Bushy of Iron ButterflyRon Bushy was the menacing drummer who will always be remembered for the epic drum solo that consumed almost all of Side 2 on the Iron Butterfly’s magnum opus album, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Bushy was the only member of the band to appear on all six official Iron Butterfly albums.\n\nAnd Bushy was the perfect name for Ron’s looks with his bushy eyebrows, dark hair, dark moustache and goatee. He looked a bit too much like Charles Manson before we had even heard of Charles Manson. After Manson’s infamy, Bushy would change the looks that belied his sweet nature. When asked about having to stay isolated due to COVID-19, he responded with, “We have been home and going out only when need. I’ve been fortunate, because I’m happily married, and I actually enjoy being with my wife Nancy.”\n\nRon Bushy in later years, still playing with Iron ButterflyIn-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was the first album I bought with my own money. It was 1968 and I was 10 years old. Truth be told, although I was fascinated by Bushy’s thunderous drumming, it was the keyboardist, Doug Ingle, who grabbed my attention. Ingle’s father had been a church organist and that influence showed on the son’s Rock musicianship.\n\nBut almost every boy I knew memorized that drum solo from In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. We could all bang along on the table in synch with the Bushy beats. The album stayed on the charts for 140 weeks, 81 weeks in the top ten. The album has sold over 30 million copies and was actually the very first album to be certified Platinum when it sold 8 million copies.\n\nIn March of this year, Bushy donated his iconic drum set to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This drum set was created for Ron Bushy in 1969 by Bill Zickos. It is the very first set the company built and the first clear, acrylic drum kit in the world.\n\nOf the band members on In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, only Doug Ingle remains. The Official Twitter account for the band issued this statement on Bushy’s death: “Ron Bushy, our beloved legendary drummer of Iron Butterfly, has passed away peacefully, with his wife Nancy by his side, at 12:05am on August 29th at UCLA Santa Monica Hospital,\" the band said in a statement. \"All three of his daughters were also with him. He was a real fighter. He was born Dec 23, 1941. He will be deeply missed!”\n\nCharlie Watts of the Rolling Stones\n\nOn Tuesday, we received word that Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones had passed. His death sent seismic shockwaves through the music world. If anyone of the Stones was expected to pass, it was not Charlie Watts.\n\nCharlie Watts never expected to play with the Rolling Stones for 58 years. In fact, he thought that the band would play together and fade away. But America discovered the Beatles in 1964 and the Stones were never far behind.\n\nWatts was never especially interested in Rock and Roll, either. He considered himself a Jazz drummer and you can hear that in his playing with the Stones. But he could also play with metronomic steadiness like on Miss You or with swinging savvy like on Rock and Hard Place. He could play the Motown tunes like he was an original Funk Brother or carry on in straight-up Jazz like Elvin Jones or Jack DeJohnette.\n\nVery recently, I saw a video of the Stone touring their old neighborhood. Guitarist Keith Richards said, “Oh, man. It’s great to see old friends. And to make some new ones.” Singer Mick Jagger looked over at Charlie Watts, who was walking with his head down and his hands in his pockets, and said, “Whad’ya think, Charlie? Charlie lifted his head with a big smile and just said, “Yes!” The other three Stones burst into laughter and Mick put his arm around Charlie and pulled him close, saying, “Ah, my Charlie!”\n\nThat was nice to see after so many years together. And it wasn’t always that way. Here’s my favorite Charlie Watts story.\n\nThe Stones had been on tour in America and Charlie, as usual, went to the hotel and to bed before the rest of them. Sometime late in the night, Mick arrived at the hotel and, in the lobby, yelled, “Where’s my %#@*ing drummer?” He repeated it and then called up to Charlie’s room and repeated the line to Charlie.\n\nCharlie got out of bed, washed, shaved, put on his suit, and went downstairs to the lobby. When he saw Mick, he crossed the floor of the lobby and punched Mick right in the face. Mick dropped like a …well, stone…and Charlie stood straddling the prostrate Mick and pointed his finger at Mick, saying, “I’m not your %#@*ing drummer! You’re MY %#@*ing singer!”\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Mick just lay there giggling as Charlie went back upstairs to bed.\n\nI was never really a Rolling Stones fan but I was always a huge Charlie Watts fan. The only reason I ever wanted to see the Stones in concert was to see Charlie.\n\nWho can forget the now-famous video of the Stones performing Start Me Up with multiple cutaway shots to Charlie who was playing spot-on but shaking his head and laughing at the antics of Mick and Keith…and Ronnie Wood.\n\nThe Stones paid tribute to Charlie with a very sweet video that remembered Charlie’s playing and personality and declared his drum set “closed for business.”\n\n​Rest in Peace, Charlie. My world is a bit sadder without you in it.\n\nAs I grew up, I began collecting records at about the age of nine years old. My first record was Schubert’s Symphonies No. 5 and 8 (The Unfinished Symphony). I still have it in my collection and Schubert has remained a favorite composer of mine.\n\nMy first paid-for album\n\nThe first album I ever bought with my own money was Iron Butterfly’s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. It was the 17-minute title track on Side Two of the album that had everybody enthralled. The drum solo was probably 12 minutes long and everybody was wondering what in the world the song was referencing.\n\n​As it turns out, Doug Ingle—lead singer and keyboard player—slurred the words “In the Garden of Eden.” The band was kind of vamping the song as they waited for the producer to arrive in the studio. But the recording engineer decided to roll the tape and they wound up with this extended, slurred pronunciation, beat-your-brains-out drum solo version that they all loved when they played it back.\n\nIn 1971, I heard an interview with Doug Ingle. He described a concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Iron Butterfly had a band called Yes as their opening act. They were so taken with the band that they came back onstage and jammed with Yes. Straightaway, I was intrigued and I approached my friend, Jimmy Lester, and he loaned me the latest album (at that time) from Yes called, The Yes Album. I was immediately and irretrievably hooked on Yes. To this day, they remain my favorite band.\n\nDiscovering My Favorite Band, a Band called YES\n\nI discovered that Yes had released two previous albums and I went out and bought those and have bought every album ever since. Even the unofficial releases.\n\nDoug Ingle’s father was a church organist and that influence always played heavily in Iron Butterfly’s sound. Chris Squire of Yes had been a member of the St. Paul’s Cathedral Boys Choir and the vocal arrangements of Yes always had that layered, sometimes contrapuntal, aspect to the vocals. Plus, Rick Wakeman (Yes’ now and again keyboardist) was trained in church music and has written numerous hymns.\n\nBut the Yes album that has remained my favorite was the album Close to the Edge. I have probably listened to that album and the title song more than any other album and song.\n\n​\n\nOne time, my oldest son and I were driving someplace and the song Close to the Edge was playing on the car stereo. My son said, “How long have you been listening to this album or song?” The album was released in 1972 and I got it the day it was released. My son asked me the question in 1996 so, doing the math, I answered, “24 years.”\n\nHe said, “Okay, I’m going to turn the volume to zero but let the song keep playing. When I’m ready to turn the volume back up, tell me where the song is.” I agreed. He turned the volume down and waited a minute or two. When he reached for the volume knob I started singing, “On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley…” And that, of course, is exactly where the song was.\n\nMy son just shook his head and said, “You’re a freak.”\n\nSo, through all my years of getting new car stereos or home audio equipment, the first thing I always listened to on the new sound equipment was Close to the Edge. I’ll come back to that.\n\nA Growing Record Collection\n\nI eventually accumulated a collection of 3,500 record albums and countless 45 RPMs and cassettes and CDs. I wound up selling off most of the albums and singles, keeping only the precious core albums—no more than 200 albums. I sold off my stereo system around 2001 but kept the records, even though I had nothing to play them on.\n\nMy wife Nicole is the only one (besides my sister and children) who understood what those albums meant to me. Months ago, she began introducing the idea of me getting a new stereo system. The new systems were hideously expensive (at least, for the brands I wanted), so I began to look at vintage systems. Those older systems sound better, anyway.\n\nA New Stereo System\n\nI finally got the system I wanted. Recovering from the shoulder surgery kept me from installing it right away but I finally was able to move around the heavy components. I was setting it all up late one night and Nicole came into the room. I heard her laugh behind me and I turned around. “Wow,” she laughed. “You sure are concentrating. I have been calling your name and you never even heard me.” I apologized, kissed her goodnight, and went back to it.\n\nThe next morning, Nicole asked if I listened to the stereo. I told that I did. “What was the first thing you listened to?” she asked. “Close to the Edge,” I answered. Then came John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On, and more.\n\nMusic and Me\n\nMusic that we love is a funny thing. As I sat listening to the album, a lifetime of memories washed over me. I remembered the first time I heard it, late at night, when everyone in my parents’ house had gone to sleep, then to driving in my first car and listening on my Pioneer Super Tuner™ KP-500. Then graduation night from high school, when I skipped out on the parties and drove to the beach to sit on the hood of my car and listen to Close to the Edge alone. College, grad school, my cousin Linda, my boys, all came back to me. And it helped me remember who I am.\n\nThat rediscovery of me has been a long and slow process. Experiences and pains had buried a lot of me. Then Nicole, like Jesus calling Lazarus to come forth, reawakened me and removed my grave clothes. They joy of simply listening to a record I love had been withheld from me for a long time but Nicole gave it back.\n\nTo touch a vinyl record, remove it from the sleeve, smell that distinctive smell of the record, read the liner notes on the interior sleeve or back of the album, is a sensory delight.\n\n​And for those who say that CDs are superior…well, I don’t even want to know you.\n\nBob Dylan turned 80 on May 24. There are only a handful of artists who have changed, shaped, upended the musical world like Dylan.\n\nIt is a telling fact that Dylan is the first songwriter to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016 but he didn’t win it for songwriting; he won it for poetry. He also won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize For his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power. And that tells you everything you need to know.\n\nBut I have more on the topic of Bob Dylan. And this is where it gets personal.\n\nBob Dylan in Concert\n\nBob Dylan doesn’t sing sweetly like a Harry Nilsson and sometimes, especially in concert, it is difficult to make out the lyrics. But if you are going to Dylan for the tunes, you’re going for the wrong reason and the Nobel and Pulitzer prize committees understand that.\n\nWhen I like authors, I don’t just like the stories they tell. I like the way they tell the story, the words they use. There is a reason Shakespeare is Shakespeare. In Henry V, my favorite of Shakespeare’s plays, King Henry is encouraging his men before the Battle of Agincourt where the French outnumbered them 3:1. With the battle about to be fought on St. Crispin’s Day (October 25), Henry told his beleaguered troops:\n\nThis story shall the good man teach his son;\n\nAnd Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,\n\nFrom this day to the ending of the world,\n\nBut we in it shall be remembered-\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\n\nThe Poetry of Dylan\n\nFor me, Dylan has that kind of poetic power. Whether he is being comical as in Buckets of Rain or indignant against injustice like Hurricane (about the framed boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter) or leisurely like Mozambique, he uses words and not melodies to tell the stories he wishes to tell.\n\nHaving listened to Bob Dylan for far more than 50 years, he never ceases to move me with his writing. In Shelter from the Storm, Dylan writes/intones:\n\nIn a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\n\nI bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\n\nI offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\nThat stanza gets me every time I hear it. And I hear it a lot because it’s one of my favorites. More than that, it describes for me what my life was like leading up to when I fell in love with Nicole.\n\nThen there is the poetry and power of All Along the Watchtower with its second stanza that almost become like hallowed scripture to me with its imagery and wisdom.\n\nThere are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke\n\nBut you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate\n\nSo let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late\n\nTalk falsely now. What a phrase.\n\nThe Cool of Bob Dylan\n\nIf Miles Davis is the embodiment of cool, Bob Dylan is the Spirit of cool. Here’s a great example: Dylan was invited to perform at the Obama White House. I heard President Obama describe this to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\n“It’s mysterious. Has a little quirky smile on his face,” President Obama told Fallon. “That’s what you want from Bob Dylan. You don’t want him to be all chatty and eating off the cheese plate and all that stuff. It would disappoint you.”\n\nBob Dylan at the White House (Photo courtesy of the Obama White House Archives)He said that most performers show up early and chat up the staff and try to get a photo with the president. Not Dylan. “He showed up only a few minutes before the show and walked right on stage, sang, and walked off. He just looked at me and winked,” the President said. “I leaned over to Michelle and said, ‘He’s just so cool.’”\n\nHe performed with George Harrison in the Concert for Bangladesh and in The Last Waltz with the Band. He introduced me to Emmylou Harris back in 1975 when she sang seven songs with Dylan on the album Desire, especially the song One More Cup of Coffee which was inspired by Dylan leaving his time spent with Basques. It becomes a dialogue between a man and a woman who are forced to leave each other. But what makes the song even more amazing is the natural minor scale used and Dylan sings it in a Basque style of vocalization.\n\nAgain, you don’t go to Dylan for a catchy tune. You go for imagery and wisdom and the beauty of words.\n\nI’ve only gotten to see Bob Dylan twice in concert and I wish Nicole could have been there with me. But we were taking a long drive one weekend to and from La Crosse. We found a radio station that was playing a marathon of radio shows wherein Dylan hosted the show and played songs of interest to him with his cool narratives between the songs. At one point, he said, “Did you know that the harmonica is the most popular instrument sold in the world? You’re welcome.”\n\nBest of all, Nicole likes him as much as I do and she listens to him without prompting from me. My girl.\n\nThe year 2020 belied all expectations and defied all predictions. Nevertheless, this annus horribilis was met with unabashedly remarkable music that flew in the face of dashed hopes. He was speaking of violence but Leonard Bernstein said, “This will be our reply…to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.”\n\nThis is exactly what the following artists have done. In the face of pandemic, cultural distrust, incompetent political leadership and, yes, violence, these wonderful people have created intense, beautiful, and devoted music.\n\n​\n\nI cannot categorize the music between formats and styles this year. All I can say is that this is the music that inspired me and gave me hope. I love these artists as people as much as musicians and composers.\n\nAJOYO – War Chant\n\nDo not let it be said that Jazz has nothing to offer in this present time. The glory days of jazz are not over, far from it, and if you need proof of it, all you need to do is listen to AJOYO’s new album War Chant. This is their second release following their 2015 eponymous album.\n\nWar Chant is a spiritual call-to-arms against oppression, greed, fear of others, and isolation—national and individual. AJOYO does it with grace and strength, intelligence and wit, and—most of all—a love and acceptance of who we are and who we should be.\n\nMarkus Reuter Oculus – Nothing is Sacred\n\nMarkus Reuter is one of the most extraordinary musicians and composers of this or any other century. In the wake of so many brilliant and innovative releases, Reuter presents his first Oculus project, featuring equally remarkable musicians who fit like a fist in glove in their presentation of Nothing is Sacred.\n\nMarkus Reuter Oculus’s Nothing is Sacred is everything we have come to expect, respect, and admire from Markus Reuter. No idea is left unexplored, no question unanswered, in this brilliant album of shadow and light.\n\nAlex Wintz Trio – Live to Tape\n\nAlex Wintz decided to go old school with his trio and record his latest album Live to Tape on analog equipment in a successful attempt to recapture the warmth of the Blue Note era recordings. It was the perfect set-up for the guitar trio format, made more perfect with the artistry of bassist Dave Baron and drummer Jimmy Macbride, his longstanding comrades in arms.\n\nAntonio Adolfo – BruMa: Celebrating Milton Nascimento\n\nAntonio Adolfo, one of the great talents to emerge from Brazil, has released BruMa: Celebrating Milton Nascimento. Antonio first met Milton in 1967 when they were both participants at Rio de Janeiro's International Song Festival. The next year, Antonio and his trio performed with Milton, first in the recording studio and then a two-months run of their show in Ipanema. Now, Antonio Adolfo breathes new life into the work of the maestro in a time when Milton Nascimento’s vision and voice should not be forgotten.\n\nDavid Cross & Peter Banks – Crossover\n\nDavid’s violin brilliance and Peter’s guitar work is more beautiful than ever and the support of these astounding musicians with Peter and David make this album feel as monumental as the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nBravo, David Cross, for finishing what you and Peter Banks started over seven years ago. It has truly been worth the wait.\n\nDavid K. Mathews – The Fantasy Vocal Sessions, Vol. 2\n\nDavid K. Mathews has taken a delightful collection of songs from several genres and has given us a masterwork of favorite vocalists interpreting these moving and inspiring and reflective songs in ways that do honor to the originals. Mathews’ playing is incredible and his assembly of supporting artists is appropriate and well-conceived.\n\nI can’t wait for Volumes 3 and 4.\n\nSarah Elizabeth Charles & Jarrett Cherner – Tone\n\nTone is the inevitable evolution of the talents, skills, and hearts of Sarah Elizabeth Charles and Jarrett Cherner. Like lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids combing to make life, these two amazing artists have created something unique that the world has awaited since the beginning. It’s that good.\n\nJasnam Daya Singh and the Portland Jazz Composers Ensemble – EKTA: The Unity Project\n\nEKTA: The Unity Project is not about Utopia—it is not the absence of division but the overcoming of it. Nor is it simply a hope for the future but a vision that begins with coming together, followed by acceptance, and ending in oneness and walking forward together.\n\nJasnam Daya Singh is not only a national treasure. He is a global one.\n\nGary Husband & Markus Reuter – Music of Our Times\n\nGary Husband and Markus Reuter were on tour in China and Japan with Stick Men. They had finished their one and only performance in Nagoya, Japan, at the famed Blue Note. Then the world changed. The Stick Men Tour (with Tony Levin, Markus Reuter, Pat Mastelotto and special guest Gary Husband) was abruptly canceled. Producer and MoonJune Records owner Leonardo Pavkovic quickly booked studio time in Tokyo before the return flights of Reuter and Husband. The results--Music of Our Time--are something extraordinary.\n\nLP and the Vinyl – Heard and Seen\n\nI’ve been a fan of Danny Green for quite some time now. His trio’s Altered Narratives was on my Favorites of 2016 list and 2018’s One Day It Will ranks as one of my all-time favorites. In the review of One Day It Will, I wrote, “And just when I thought Danny Green’s Trio had outdone themselves with 2015’s Altered Narratives, they release One Day It Will, their third album on OA2 Records. It is the very same brilliant trio of Danny Green on piano, Justin Grinnell on bass, and Julien Cantelm on drums. In fact, they have been together since 2010.”\n\nOn One Day It Will, Danny & Company added a string quartet from the San Diego Symphony. The latest project brings a return of that great trio with the remarkable addition of Leonard Patton on vocals. That assembly is called LP and the Vinyl and their album is Heard and Seen.\n\nSusan Tobocman – Touch & Go\n\nNow this is a good album. Susan Tobocman has chosen a fine collection of standards, classics, and originals and a band of dedicated and interpretive artists that can give life to the instrumentation and can give her space for her own vocal expressions to make her album Touch & Go a work worthy of great attention and praise.\n\nSusan Tobocman is a Jazz lover’s dream. Her vocals are beyond compare but her arrangements and compositions are beyond description. She is talented and brilliant beyond measure. Touch & Go does not describe the power and beauty of the album; she was full on, right on, every step of the way.\n\nSpanish Harlem Orchestra – The Latin Jazz Project\n\nThe Latin Jazz Project is what we have been waiting for from Spanish Harlem Orchestra. With six previous recordings, they have given us glimpses and splashes of Latin jazz. Thanks to Artistshare, a fan-funded project program, SHO have given us a full-length recording of pure Latin jazz. Their last album, Anniversary, was the Grammy winner for Best Tropical Latin Album. A wonderful album.\n\nBut Musical director Oscar Hernandez, with two brilliant Latin Jazz albums under his belt, has brought his full creative force to bear with SHO for another album of wonder. The Latin Jazz Project will certainly be a Grammy contender.\n\nRudresh Mahanthappa – Hero Trio\n\nI've always enjoyed about Rudresh Mahanthappa is the way he never settles on a given expression or style. Ever since I began listening to him, he has pushed his own boundaries to new places and always finds fertile soil for his musical imagination wherever he ventures. Such is the case with his new album entitled Hero Trio.\n\nHero Trio is exactly what it says it is. Rudresh Mahanthappa, Franςois Moutin, and Rudy Royston have created a powerful, precise, and—okay—perfect album. There’s no Kryptonite on this album.\n\nLauren Henderson – The Songbook Session\n\nLauren Henderson continues to thrill, comfort, and amaze with every album she has released. Whether YouTube live performances, EPs, or full-length albums, Lauren never disappoints. Her 2020 CD The Songbook Session is no different.\n\nThe Songbook Session is Lauren’s third full-length album and it is her best to date. She takes standards from the 30s and 40s and breathes sweet life into them all over again, almost as if we had never heard them before. When an artist can make you forget everything that has gone before, it is something amazing. Such is this album.\n\nJesse Fischer – Resilience\n\nIt has been an excellent year for Jesse Fisher. First, he participated in the phenomenal War Chant album by Ajoyo. Now he releases his latest project as a leader called Resilience. Resilience incorporates the influences of modern Jazz, African music, and Near Eastern music reflecting Jesse's own Jewish heritage.\n\nJesse Fischer has not only envisioned and composed a beautiful album, he has brought together the right players for the right job. It is executed with power and precision and—dare I say—purity. Resilience does not lose its way once. It is focused and is a frontal assault at what life throws our way, and how we can overcome.\n\nGato Libre – Koneko\n\nKoneko is the eighth album from Gato Libre and the first since 2017’s Neko. Since 2015, Gato Libre (Spanish for Free Cat) has been a trio comprised of Natsuki Tamura on trumpet, Yasuko Kaneko on trombone and Satoko Fujii and accordion. Unlike Kaze (Japanese for Breeze), the other band with Tamura and Fujii, Gato Libre is more informed by tone and texture than in frenetic virtuosity.\n\nKoneko (Japanese for Kitten) is a further exploration into the far reaches of said tone and texture. It is music to be heard with intent—not background music while making breakfast.\n\n(Live Streaming Performance) Farofa – Jazz on YOUR Green; Live at the Omaha Performing Arts\n\nIn the days of limited access to live music, innovative promoters and artists are finding a way to still bring the joy and magic of the live performance. God bless Jazz on YOUR Green, Omaha Performing Arts, Manager Marian Liebowitz, and the band of extraordinary artists called Farofa.\n\nIt was a joyous romp that was energetic, spirited, fascinating, and leaving you wanting more. Farofa is a new band with original compositions and original takes on old songs. Farofa pulls the listener up to their level and makes you crave their understanding of life in the world we live.\n\nFavorite Record Label - MoonJune\n\nLeonardo \"MoonJune\" Pavkovic is a one-man record label who brings together the most remarkable musicians and composers from every country and every genre. The whole always becomes greater than the sum of their parts. Leonardo is a visionary who loves artists and the music they create.\n\n​\n\nI am thankful for all the beautiful work offered in 2020 by all of these beautiful people.\n\n~Travis Rogers, Jr. is the Jazz Owl\n\nOn Saturday, July 25, 2020, the music world lost Peter Green, a great guitarist and the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac. His family released a statement to the BBC on Saturday morning.\n\nThat same day, music legend Peter Frampton Tweeted: “Most sadly have lost one of the most tasteful guitar players ever. I have always been a huge admirer of the great Peter Green. May he rest in peace.”\n\nI feel compelled to write about Peter Green since, sadly, so few people know who he was. Guitarist, singer, songwriter, and original founding member and leader of Fleetwood Mac, he was only in the group for two years and eight months (starting in 1968 and leaving in May 1970).\n\nEarly Career\n\nBorn in London in 1946, Peter began his career as a teenager in 1965 as the guitarist for John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, where he replaced Eric Clapton who had moved on to form the band Cream. Two years later, Peter teamed up with drummer Mick Fleetwood to form Fleetwood Mac after they recruited John McVie on bass.\n\nThe original Peter Green version of Fleetwood Mac was a blues-based band. Under Peter's direction, the early incarnation of Fleetwood Mac released three albums, starting with its 1968 self-titled debut, followed by Mr. Wonderful (1968) and Then Play On (1969).\n\nHuge Hits\n\nDuring his time in the group, Peter penned such popular songs as Albatross, Man of the World, Oh Well and Black Magic Woman, which later became a massive worldwide hit for Carlos Santana.\n\n“Peter’s voice, and the songs he wrote, often spoke of troubled thoughts, and his guitar solos relied on expressive, long-lined melody rather than speed,” wrote New York Times music critic Jon Pareles.\n\n“I like to play slowly and feel every note,” Peter once said.\n\nPeter Green’s instrumental piece Albatross became a #1 hit in the UK in 1969. At one point, Peter suggested the band donate a percentage of their royalties and profits to help alleviate poverty. After all, he reckoned, how much money does one person need? The band refused but Peter took it on himself to donate from his huge royalties.\n\nAccording to one of the band’s managers, The Green Manilishi, the last song that Peter wrote and recorded with Fleetwood Mac, was about the negative aspects of money, fame, and greed. Peter left Fleetwood Mac in 1970.\n\nSchizophrenia\n\nPeter continued to release music following his departure from Fleetwood Mac, including his 1970 solo debut, The End of the Game. Peter would later be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a possibly incorrect diagnosis. He was, nevertheless, institutionalized and given electro-shock treatments which ultimately made his condition more severe and unstable. He struggled for quite a while, was institutionalized again and heavily sedated for years. Because of his mental illness, however, the guitarist wouldn't release another solo album until 1979. His last solo release was 1983's Kolors.\n\nHe returned to performing and recording on and off, eventually achieving some mental stability after he stopped taking medication.\n\nA Return to Music\n\nDuring the 1990s, Peter teamed up with guitarist Nigel Watson and drummer Cozy Powell to form Peter Green Splinter Group, releasing several albums in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 1998, Peter Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with seven other past and present other members of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nIn February, Mick Fleetwood organized an all-star tribute to the early years of Fleetwood Mac with Peter, featuring performances by Billy Gibbons, David Gilmour, Steven Tyler and many others.\n\n​\n\n“The concert is a celebration of those early blues days where we all began, and it’s important to recognize the profound impact Peter and the early Fleetwood Mac had on the world of music,” Fleetwood explained in a statement. “Peter was my greatest mentor and it gives me such joy to pay tribute to his incredible talent. I am honored to be sharing the stage with some of the many artists Peter has inspired over the years and who share my great respect for this remarkable musician.”\n\nAccording to his family, in a statement released to the BBC, Peter died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73.\n\nOn Monday, February 10, Nicole and I had finished putting the February 11 edition of the Sentinel & Rural News together and Nicole was getting the last of the pages sent to the printer. As I waited for her, I was looking through my Twitter feed and ran across the terrible news that Jazz pianist/keyboardist and composer Lyle Mays had died at the age of only 66 years.\n\nOnly last year, Jazz journalist CJ Stearn from New York City had interviewed me for his Jazz Talk program and we spend a good deal of the two-hour discussion about Lyle Mays and his work with Pat Metheny. Lyle was a longtime collaborator with Metheny. He was an innovative keyboard player whose expansive textures and touching solos on grand piano provided a key element of the Pat Metheny sound. Indeed, he was a cornerstone to that sound. Mays was also co-composer of many the Pat Metheny Group anthems for four decades.\n\nA Wisconsin NativeLyle was a native of Wausaukee, Wisconsin. He studied Jazz at North Texas State University when it, along with the University of Miami, was accounted as the best Jazz schools in the country. He played for the North Texas State University Lab Band and was composer-arranger of the Grammy-nominated album Lab 75. In fact, a friend of mine’s son is studying Jazz at University of North Texas (as it is now called) and said that they are still performing the charts created by Lyle 45 years ago.\n\nLyle later toured with Woody Herman’s Orchestra for eight months (1975-1976). Then he met Pat Metheny.\n\nLyle Meets Pat MethenyThey first met at the Wichita Jazz Festival in 1975 and Lyle later appeared on the Metheny’s 1977 album, Watercolors.\n\nI had come to Jazz through the 1975 Keith Jarrett album, the Köln Concert. I grabbed all the Jarrett albums I could and was—and still am—hooked on piano Jazz. But through my growing familiarity with Jarrett, I came to know many other Jazz artists with whom he performed and recorded and then who recorded with them and so on. It led me to an album by a guitarist named Pat Metheny (who had attended University of Miami) called Bright Size Life. It was a trio album with the great Jaco Pastorius on bass and Bob Moses on drums. I enjoyed the album a lot but there were no keyboards on that album. That was 1976.\n\nThe next year brought the release of Watercolors with Metheny on guitar, the amazing Eberhard Weber on bass, the equally amazing Danny Gottlieb on drums and a kid named Lyle Mays on piano and keyboards. Lyle became the reason that I stayed a fan of the Pat Metheny bands for so many years. I saw Pat Metheny in concert four times from 1979 through 1990 and I went in order to see Lyle.\n\nLyle contributed as a player and co-composer to a remarkably productive string of Pat Metheny Group albums, including 1978’s Pat Metheny Group, 1979’s American Garage, 1981’s Off Ramp, 1983’s Travels, 1984’s First Circle, 1987’s Still Life (Talking), 1989’s Letter From Home, 1992’s Secret Story (although Lyle is rarely present), 1993’s The Road To You, 1994’s We Live Here, 1996’s Quartet, 1997’s Imaginary Day, 2002’s Speaking of Now and culminating with 2005’s The Way Up, a sprawling through-composed jazz tone poem co-written by Mays and Metheny divided into four sections. Mays and Metheny also lent their trademark sound to the sweeping soundtrack to the 1984 film The Falcon and the Snowman, which featured David Bowie’s vocals on “This Is Not America.”\n\nContributions to the Pat Metheny GroupWith Lyle on keyboards, especially on piano, the group’s sound became joyful but reverent. On the 1980 album As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls, the song September 15 was dedicated to the inimitable Jazz pianist Bill Evans who had died on September 15, 1980. It was the best thing I had ever heard. It was sweet and sad and to this day I still am moved beyond words by the beauty of that piece.\n\nBut in 1984, the Pat Metheny Group released the album First Circle. That album contained a track called Praise. Pedro Aznarprovided wordless vocals overtop the exquisite keyboards of Lyle and the beautiful guitar of Metheny. I think I wore out three copies of that vinyl record.\n\nMeeting LyleAs it worked out, I got to tell Lyle that myself in 1984 just before their concert in Waco, Texas. I was living there at the time and I knew a guy who worked at the concert hall. I convinced him (okay, I gave him $20) to let me in to see the soundcheck before the show. I got to meet Lyle who—despite the stories of him being so reclusive—was incredibly friendly. I realized that he was only five years older than me and told him of my admiration for September 15 and Praise. I even said that Praise was a song that I wished would never end. He smiled and said, “Well, I see what I can do.”\n\nThat night, they performed most of the songs from the First Circle album and more but…no Praise. They left the stage and I was extremely disappointed. I thought, “Well, maybe I’m the only one who likes it.” Then, with the standing ovation still in progress, the band returned to the stage for an encore. Metheny walked up to the microphone and said, “We usually play American Garage for our encore but Lyle wanted to save the encore for this one.” I wish we had iPhones in those days so I could have recorded it.\n\nThey started on the first chord and I—and everyone else—knew that it was Praise. That song is 4:19 on the album but, that night, it went on for over 10 minutes. When I thought they were closing out the song, Lyle circled his finger over his head and the vamping began. They played off each other incredibly and I had the time of my young life.\n\nLyle as Leader and Solo ArtistLyle didn’t record much as a leader, beginning with his self-titled 1985 debut and continuing with 1988’s Street Dreams, 1992’s Fictionary and 2000’s Solo: Improvisations for Expanded Piano. He was a member of the celebrated band on Joni Mitchell’s Shadows and Light tour in 1979 that included Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Michael Brecker and Don Alias. He won 11 Grammys and was nominated 23 times. In 2016, he was inducted into the Wisconsin Area Music Industry’s Hall of Fame.\n\nReactions to Lyle's PassingPat Metheny posted on his website the day Lyle passed, “Lyle was one of the greatest musicians I have ever known. Across more than 30 years, every moment we shared in music was special. From the first notes we played together, we had an immediate bond. His broad intelligence and musical wisdom informed every aspect of who he was in every way. I will miss him with all my heart.”\n\nSteve Rodby, who joined as bassist and producer for the Pat Metheny Group in 1980, also issued a statement on Metheny’s Facebook page: “I had the great privilege of having Lyle in my life for decades, as an inspiration and as my friend. As anyone who knew him and his music will agree, there will only be one Lyle, and we all will continue to appreciate his soulful brilliance, in so many ways.”\n\nOn Thursday, Metheny expanded on his thoughts of Lyle: “There was a valuable lesson I learned early on from my most important mentor, Gary Burton; when you start a group, you have an obligation to choose the best musicians you can possibly find. And then, if you are lucky, once you have great people in place, you have an even more important obligation; to create an environment for them to do their very best.\n\n“The mandate of the bandleader as I understood it from Gary, (and I believe he understood it from Stan Getz who got it from —… who got it from —…ad infinitum) was to offer the most talented players every opportunity to develop the things that they are most interested to the highest degree possible under your auspices; to create a platform that intersects with what your goals are as a leader, but also a zone that provides a world open to exploration and expansion for everyone. When the moment comes that that intersection is no longer in sight for either side of the equation, that is when it is time to make a change.\n\n“With Lyle, as with Steve Rodby, that moment never came. There was always plenty to talk about. In fact, it seemed infinite…\n\n“As I wrote earlier. I will miss him with all my heart.\n\nIn addition to everything else; Lyle, Steve, and I were friends for going on half a century, and together we shared many of the ups-and-downs of our lives together here on the planet, on and off the bandstand. I am most grateful for that above all.”\n\nI had hoped that someday we could get Lyle Mays to the Central Wisconsin Jazz Festival. And even though we will never get to hear more from him, we are blessed that we have such a wealth of recordings that can be summoned for our pleasure and edification whenever we want.\n\nThanks for all of it, Lyle.​\n\nOn Friday afternoon, March 6, I saw the announcement from McCoy Tyner’s family that he had passed away. He was a cornerstone of John Coltrane’s groundbreaking 1960s quartet and one of the most influential pianists in jazz history. He was 81.\n\nIt has been a bad couple of weeks for Jazz pianists.\n\nMcCoy and John Coltrane\n\nTyner first attracted wide notice as a member of John Coltrane’s famed quartet of Coltrane, Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones. This was my favorite quartet ever.\n\nHe influenced virtually every pianist in Jazz in one way or another. Along with Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, and only a few others, Tyner was one of the main expressways of modern Jazz piano. Nearly every Jazz pianist since Tyner’s years with Coltrane has had to learn his lessons, whether they ultimately stayed with them or not.\n\nTyner’s style was modest, even reserved, but his sound was so rich, so percussive and so serious. His emotional improvisations were anchored by powerful left-hand chords marking the first beat of the bar and the tonal center of the music. That sound helped create the foundation of Coltrane’s music and, to some extent, all Jazz in the 1960s.\n\nHe served as a grounding force for Coltrane. In a 1961 interview in Downbeat, about a year and a half after hiring Tyner, Coltrane said: “My current pianist, McCoy Tyner, holds down the harmonies, and that allows me to forget them. He’s sort of the one who gives me wings and lets me take off from the ground from time to time.”\n\nWhen he left Coltrane in 1965, Tyner did not find immediate success. But within a decade, his fame had caught up with his influence, and he remained one of the leading bandleaders in Jazz as well as one its most honored pianists for the rest of his life.\n\nYounger Years\n\nAlfred McCoy Tyner was born in Philadelphia on December 11, 1938, to Jarvis and Beatrice Tyner, both natives of North Carolina. His father sang in a church quartet and worked for a company that made medicated cream; his mother was a beautician. Tyner started taking piano lessons at the age of 13 and, a year later, his mother bought him his first piano and set it up in her beauty shop.\n\nWhile still in high school, Tyner began taking music theory lessons and, by 16, he was playing professionally with a rhythm-and-blues band at house parties around Philadelphia and Atlantic City.\n\nTyner was in a band led by the trumpeter Cal Massey in 1957 when he met Coltrane at a Philadelphia club called the Red Rooster. At the time, Coltrane, who grew up in Philadelphia but had left in 1955 to join Miles Davis’s quintet, was back in town, between tenures with Miles’ band. The two musicians struck up an immediate friendship. Coltrane was living at his mother’s house, and Tyner would visit him there where they would sit on the porch and talk. Tyner would later say that Coltrane was something of an older brother to him.\n\nJoining the Trane\n\nIn 1958, Coltrane recorded one of Tyner’s compositions, The Believer. There was an understanding between them that when Coltrane was ready to lead his own group, he would hire Tyner as his pianist. Coltrane did eventually form his own quartet, which opened a long engagement at the Jazz Gallery in Manhattan in May 1960, but with Steve Kuhn as the pianist. A month later, halfway through the engagement, Coltrane made good on his promise, replacing Kuhn with Tyner. It was the best decision Coltrane could have made.\n\nThat October, Tyner made its first recordings with Coltrane for Atlantic Records that produced much of the material for the albums My Favorite Things, Coltrane Jazz, Coltrane’s Sound and Coltrane Plays the Blues.\n\nHe was 21 when he joined the Coltrane quartet. He would remain — along with the drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison — for the next five years. Through his work with the group, which came to be known as the “classic” Coltrane quartet, he became one of the most widely imitated pianists in Jazz. Coltrane is my all-time favorite Jazz artist and Elvin Jones remains my favorite drummer. Tyner was blessed indeed to be in the midst of those two along with Jimmy Garrison.\n\nHe knew when to hammer on and when to lay off. “What you don’t play is sometimes as important as what you do play,” he told his fellow pianist Marian McPartland on her wonderful NPR show called Piano Jazz. “I would leave space, which wouldn’t identify the chord so definitely to the point that it inhibited your other voicings.”\n\nThe Coltrane quartet worked constantly through 1965, reaching one high-water mark for Jazz after another on albums like A Love Supreme, Crescent, Coltrane Live at Birdland, Ballads, and Impressions, all recorded for the Impulse label.\n\nLeaving the Trane\n\nWhen Coltrane began to expand his musical vision to include extra horns and percussionists, Tyner quit the group at the end of 1965, complaining that the music had grown so loud and unwieldy that he could not hear the piano anymore. For the next two years he hooked up with Art Blakey’s band.\n\nJust before Coltrane’s death in 1967, Tyner signed to the Blue Note label. He stayed with Blue Note for five years, starting with a fairly familiar quartet sound and progressing to larger ensembles, but these were temporary bands assembled for recording sessions, not working groups. It was a lean time for Jazz and for Tyner. It was a big deal to have quit Coltrane’s band. He was not performing much and, he later said, had considered applying for a license to drive a cab. By 1972, however, he had gained a higher profile and much more success. In those years he worked steadily with his own band, including at various times with other notable musicians.\n\nMcCoy's Own Path\n\nTyner did not use electric piano or synthesizers, or play with rock and disco backbeats, as many of the best Jazz musicians did at the time, including guys like Chick and Herbie. He maintained one of the strongest and most recognizable keyboard sounds in Jazz. He was committed to acoustic instrumentation. His experiments outside the piano ran toward the koto, as heard on the 1972 album “Sahara,” and harpsichord and celeste, on “Trident” (1975).\n\nHe formed several more bands, including big bands, and continued reaching and teaching Jazz musicians, especially pianists, everywhere.\n\nIn 2002, Tyner was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, one of the highest honors for a Jazz musician in the United States. He resisted analyzing or theorizing about his own work. He tended to talk more in terms of learning and life experience.\n\nThe Impact of McCoy Tyner\n\n“To me,” he told Nat Hentoff in a remarkable interview, “living and music are all the same thing. And I keep finding out more about music as I learn more about myself, my environment, about all kinds of different things in life.\n\n“I play what I live. Therefore, just as I can’t predict what kinds of experiences I’m going to have, I can’t predict the directions in which my music will go. I just want to write and play my instrument as I feel.”\n\nThe resounding echoes of grief were heard all over Twitter, Facebook, websites, and more over the weekend as the Jazz world tried to come to grips with the death of the teacher.\n\nThe great bassist Stanley Clark Tweeted: “A truly great one has passed. I cannot begin to tell you the depth of this great ones influence in music. Every jazz pianist has a bit of McCoy within their heart. He was the last member of the transformational, supernatural group The John Coltrane Quartet of John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, Elvin Jones. Every time I’ve ever played or recorded with McCoy it was like receiving the greatest healing medicine you could ever want.”\n\nClark Gayton posted on Facebook: “One of the highlights of my life was going on the road with the McCoy Tyner Big Band in 1990. The lineup was ridiculous. I learned so much about music and the generations before me. Too much to get into on a post. But there was this time I lost my bags in Italy. Everything. We had a show that night, and I didn't have anything to wear. I got a call from John Stubblefield right after sound check... \"You can wear a pair of my shoes tonight, man\". 10 minutes later, McCoy calls my room.\" I heard about your situation. Come by my room. I may have something for you.\" I stopped by his room, and he presented me with one of his very expensive suits. \"You can use this until you locate your bags, don't worry about it.\" I ended up wearing his suit for a week, until my bags were found somewhere. Two things, neither the shoes nor the suit fit me at all. I looked ridiculous, to put it simply. But I couldn't have been prouder! I really felt like I was one of the cats wearing that outfit. Somehow, I can't imagine that happening today. They literally gave me the clothes off their back to help me. The stories were hilarious and plenty for those 8 weeks in Europe. The band became a living being on the road. A beast. We plowed through Europe like a wild bull, and it changed my life. Thank you, McCoy. Love you much, and safe passage.”\n\nI got to see McCoy Tyner with saxman Joe Lovano in Portland in February of 2009. I had came down with a 101º temperature but I went to the show anyway. I had gotten my tickets long before and was not going to miss seeing him—my first and only time. For the 2-hour show, I forgot about what ailed me. I still have the concert poster in the office upstairs.\n\nLast Saturday, Nicole and I decided to head for the movies. If there are no concerts around, movies are the next best thing.\n\n​\n\nWe had seen the movie posters hanging in the theatres when we went to see \"A Star is Born\" a week ago and I knew I wanted to go see this, especially with Nicole.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody \"was the movie. It was better than a simple bio-pic, it was about the band Queen and their approach to making music—incredible music. It was about the flamboyant Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara) and the three brilliant musicians who joined him to make one of the most entertaining bands ever. EVER.\n\nThe movie begins with the wide-toothed Freddie approaching guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor about him becoming their new lead singer. Taylor laughed at him and said, “Not with those teeth, mate!” Freddie had been mocked and bullied about his teeth since childhood and he almost walked away. He turned on his heel to face the two again and belted out a glorious rendition of the song that their band had been playing only moments before.\n\nFreddie took control and said, “I have four additional incisors. Makes my mouth wider and gives me better range. I’ll let you know my answer.”\n\nI loved Freddie Mercury. I remember the first time I heard him. It was 1973 and I heard \"Keep Yourself Alive\" on the radio on WSHE in Ft. Lauderdale. I loved the Brian May’s squeaky guitar, John Deacon’s thundering Fender bass, and Roger Taylor’s powerful drumming. I was hooked from the first.\n\nThen came \"Killer Queen\" from the album \"Sheer Heart Attack.\" By this time, the production had gotten so much cleaner and it only made Freddie’s voice soar even more. Then in November of 1975, Queen released \"A Night at the Opera.\" I was taken with the title because it was the title of a Marx Brothers movie and I loved the Marx Brothers. But this album was remarkable.\n\nIt rendered such hits as the operatic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the ridiculous \"I’m in Love with My Car\" and the 1920s-sounding \"Lazing on A Sunday Afternoon.\"\n\nI played that album over an over and (yes) over again. Ask my cousin Linda. She recently told me that she has only been able to listen to Queen, especially that album, again in the last five years. She was subjected to constant play of that album (on 8-track!) in a car trip from Florida to Detroit. All Queen, all the time.\n\nBut the greatest song on the album, for me, was \"Love of My Life.\" It was one of the most poignant moments of the whole movie when Queen were performing in Rio de Janeiro and Freddie stopped singing and the entire audience was singing the song.\n\nRami Malek charmingly portrayed Freddie Mercury and he was wonderful. He had the mannerisms and the vocal patterns down-pat. The actors who played May, Taylor and Deacon looked just like the real guys, especially Gwilym Lee who played Brian May.\n\nMay and Taylor were the executive producers of the movie, so it gave the authentic nod to the honesty of the movie. The critics have hated the movie and that made my sister and I even more interested in seeing it. Critics have always hated Queen.\n\nIn one ironic twist in the movie, when the song Bohemian Rhapsody was released, the screen was filled with all the noise issued by the music critics. Rolling Stone magazine called Bohemian Rhapsody “brazen hodgepodge.” Later, of course, they would list it as one of the 500 Greatest Rock songs ever. The New York Times called them “pretentious and irrelevant.”\n\nIt was a laugh-out-loud moment to see all those words splashed across the screen and to realize that, here we are, calling each band member by name and I don’t even know the names of the critics.\n\nWhile Bohemian Rhapsody is the title of the movie and indeed their most popular hit single, the real theme of the movie is wrapped up in Love of My Life. That song was about Mary Austin whom Freddie adored.\n\nMary was the love of Freddie’s life. Even when Freddie discovered he was gay, he didn’t want to leave Mary. He bought her a home right next to his after they had separated. He would still flick the lamp on and off to say goodnight to her.\n\nHe sang:\n\n\"Who will remember\n\nWhen this is blown over\n\nAnd everything's all by the way\n\nWhen I grow older\n\nI will be there at your side to remind you\n\nHow I still love you - (I still love you)\"\n\nPoor Freddie. When Mary left, he was rudderless. Wonton and clinging people attached themselves to Freddie’s fame and fortune. It hurt his friendship with the band itself, tearing them apart.\n\nThen came Live Aid, the greatest concert ever. Queen performed at the last minute and absolutely stole the show.\n\nDespite the fact that Freddie discovered that he had contracted AIDS. In 1985, there was nothing that could be done. In the end, however, Freddie had made amends with everyone. He had made an opera album with Montserrat Caballé, the great Spanish opera star. It was wonderful.\n\nWhat the movie does not show, however, was that Mary never really left Freddie alone. She stayed with him even in the last years as he was slowly dying. But he wouldn’t allow tears around him and she once had to excuse herself when they were watching a recorded concert of Queen. Freddie said, “I used to be handsome.” It caught Mary by surprise and she had to leave the room tom compose herself.\n\nAfter his death in 1991, Freddie was showered with honors from the UK and abroad. He loved playing in Queen, “a band of misfits who don’t belong anywhere but together.” But his greatest honor, he said, was the have been loved by Mary Austin. I understand what he meant.\n\nThe soundtrack for the movie reached #1 a few days ago—Queen’s first #1 album in over 30 years.\n\nNicole and I saw the movie six days ago. It still hasn’t left me.\n\n~Travis Rogers, Jr. is The Jazz Owl\n\nIt was something that I have waited to see for 45 years. Having lived in some of America’s larger cities, I always thought for sure that I would be able to catch them in concert. Now, living in rural Wisconsin, I was able to catch the final concert of the US tour for that great jazz rock band Soft Machine.\n\nThey were called psychedelic rock, avant-rock, progressive rock, and jazz-fusion, but they always seemed to exceed the boundaries set for them by critics and fans. They had shared the stage with the Jimi Hendrix Experience and with Syd Barrett’s incarnation of Pink Floyd. They moved in the same orbits as King Crimson and Yes. But not quite any of them.\n\nWhen I was describing the band’s sound to Nicole, I said, “Think of King Crimson but not exactly that, either.”\n\nFinally, I was going to see the band whose albums and (now) CDs had loaded my shelves and record cases for decades. Better still, I was going to see them with Nicole. She makes even the best things better.\n\nI’d become well-acquainted with the owner, promoter, manager of MoonJune records, Leonardo Pavkovic. It was he told me that Soft Machine was going to be in concert at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Minnesota. Ah, the Turf Club. It’s called “The best remnant of the 40s.” Onstage, lead guitarist John Etheridge would that he was the best remnant of the 40s.\n\nLeonardo and I had tried to meet face-to-face a couple of years ago when he was promoting the band, Stick Men. Just before that concert, I took ill and had to miss the show and to finally meet Leonardo. This time was going to be different.\n\nLeonardo is an incredible man. Born in Bosnia in 1962, he studied literature and is himself a poet. He has actually published two volumes of original poetry. But the guy loves music. And music-lovers love him. Especially me.\n\nIn 2000, he established MoonJune Management and Booking which became MoonJune Records. Where did the name MoonJune come from? It came from the phrase “Moon in June” in Robert Wyatt’s tune on the third album by…wait for it…Soft Machine. That album was released in 1970. Obviously, Soft Machine has been near and dear to Leonardo for a long, long time.\n\nMoonJune Records is a one-man shop. He has taken bands to over 50 countries and has put on well over 2000 concerts. All by himself. Not kidding.\n\nSomewhere around 2011, Leonardo read some stuff and I had written and asked if I would review some of the albums that MoonJune was releasing. I liked Leonardo’s sense of humor and his dedication to his artists. I had no idea what working with him would be like.\n\nHe began sending me CDs of the most incredible artists I had ever heard in my life. He discovered (for the West) artists and bands from Indonesia, Italy, Serbia, and everywhere one cares to name. One of my favorite “new” bands had the great name of I Know You Well, Miss Clara.\n\nThen Leonardo started putting together artists in the most amazing combinations, introducing unbelievable artists to appear on albums together. Every time I get a new CD from Leonardo, I immediately look to see who is performing on the album and I am never disappointed.\n\nSo, we were not only going to hear Soft Machine but we were going to get to meet Leonardo Pavkovic.\n\nWe got to the club ahead of time, so that we would have plenty of time to see Leonardo. We were going to get to hang with him after the show.\n\nWhen we walked in, a guy was near the front door and had a curious look about him. I don’t mean that he looked odd but that he was looking at me curiously. I thought the myself, “Wow, that guy looks just like Beledo. But what would he be doing in St. Paul?” Beledo is another one of the MoonJune artists, a brilliant composer and a fantastic guitarist and keyboardist. We walked past each other with a smile.\n\nNicole and I sat down and ordered something to drink. I texted Leonardo and said, “We are here!” He responded, “I am not there. I am in a hospital in Milwaukee with a bacterial infection. Look for Beledo.”\n\nAre you kidding me? Come to find out, our guy had cellulitis and was kept in Milwaukee.\n\nThen I told Nicole, “Oh, wow! That was Beledo!” I hoped that maybe he was the opening act for Soft Machine.\n\nIn a few minutes, he came walking by and I called his name. He turned and he greeted us warmly, giving Nicole the Spanish double-kiss. He explained what had happened to Leonardo and, sure enough, he was going to open for Soft Machine.\n\nI texted Leonardo again, all of us saddened that we would have to wait yet again. “We’ll keep trying,” we said.\n\nThen Beledo came onstage and treated the house to beautiful Spanish guitar and beautiful keyboards. He couldn’t keep himself from singing, either.\n\nWhen Beledo described that Leonardo couldn’t be there, the crowd gave an audible groan. Since when does a manager/record-label owner/promoter ever get known or, even more, loved and admired? When it’s Leonardo Pavkovic—the guy who loves and cares for his artists and the people who love music.\n\nDuring Soft Machine’s performance, John Etheridge announced that the Downbeat magazine Reader’s Poll had just been released. The number one record label was Blue Note Records, that venerable and ancient Jazz label. Number Two was ECM, another label that has given the world amazing albums—like Keith Jarrett—since 1969.\n\nThe third record label listed in the Reader’s Poll was MoonJune Records. In 2017, it was fourth. The year before, it was fifth.\n\nA one-man label was ranked third in the world for producing albums that everyone wants to hear.\n\nNicole and I had also discovered that Soft Machine’s drummer, John Marshall, had been recalled home because of his wife’s illness. Taking his place was none other than Gary Husband. Marshall has been with Soft Machine since 1973. Husband had played with the great guitarist Allan Holdsworth, who had been a part of Soft Machine in 1975 (and again in 1981) and was replaced by John Etheridge, the current guitarist.\n\nSome call Gary Husband “the greatest drummer in the world” and it is certainly a discussion worth having. At any rate, his performance with Soft Machine in the latter part of the US tour was nothing short of astonishing.\n\nNone of the original members of Soft Machine are in the band today but the band’s legacy is kept very much alive by guitarist and onstage spokesperson John Etheridge (who joined in 1976), bassist Roy Babbington (1973), sax/flute man Theo Travis (2006) and the missing John Marshall (1971).\n\nThe last studio album from Soft Machine was 37 years ago, 1981’s The Land of Cockayne. In 1984, it looked like Soft Machine was done…and I had missed them, I feared.\n\nIn 2004, four long-time members started touring again after 20 years under the band name Soft Machine Legacy. It was during this period that they signed with MoonJune Records and Leonardo Pavkovic. And they only looked back to pick some sweet music from the highwater days of 1967-78. With the passing of Elton Dean and Hugh Hopper, the band moved forward with the youngest member Theo Travis and their great bassist Babbington. As they say, it is 3/5 of the 1975-77 line-up of greats.\n\nIn 2015, they dropped the Legacy part of the name and returned in strength as Soft Machine, playing music of early composers like Mike Ratledge and Hugh Hopper. Just in September of 2018, they released Hidden Details with band members Etheridge, Travis, Babbington, and Marshall.\n\nThis was the show Nicole and I got to see…for me, 45 years in the making and—Good Lord—I was not disappointed.\n\nIt wasn’t a concert of rattling around old numbers from their salad days nor was it simply a live casting of their new album. It was a beautiful mix of old and new. Etheridge and Travis do most of the writing these days but they included great stuff from Ratledge and Hopper.\n\nJohn Etheridge gave sage advice to young women that, if they want to stay young-looking, “Just be seen with old geezers like us! Then people will say, ‘What is that young thing doing with an old guy like him!’”\n\nThey were fun. They were skilled. They were exactly what I had hoped they would be.\n\nThey moved from lyrical and melodic to furious and exacting.\n\nThey were worth the 45-year wait.\n\n~Travis Rogers, Jr. is ​The Jazz Owl\n\nBack in July, Nicole and I were invited to be VIP guests at Addison Agen’s concert in Gilman, as a result of our sponsorship of the event. While we were greatly anticipating Addison’s concert, following fresh on the heels of her second-place finish in The Voice competition, we were pleasantly surprised—indeed amazed—at the opening act, a husband and wife duo calling themselves Wise Jennings.\n\nWise Jennings billed themselves as being Americana/Rock Roots music, heavy on the rock. It was a perfect description. Melissa played drums and harmonica (at the same time) and was on vocals with Jeff who played guitar and bass pedals and vocals, as well. These two belonged together.\n\nAfter the concert, I got to briefly meet Melissa while Nicole was taking photographs. Later, I got to chat with Jeff about the gear he was using and discovered that he was creating that thunderous bass line by playing bass pedals with his feet. They had decided to have a music festival at their place near Lake Geneva, WI, and they invited Nicole and me to attend.\n\n​\n\nThat event, which they named Wise Fest, would showcase five bands in a show that started at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. Nicole and I arrived around 3:45 and the yard was filling up with cars. Three Vintage VW buses were parked and several tents were set up for those who planned on making it an all-night excursion. There were people with frisbees and hula-hoops and bean-bag tosses, blankets all over the lawn (it was a huge green space) and lawn chair set up for the concert.\n\nSince Jeff and Melissa Weishaar (Wise Jennings) were the hosts, they took on the role of opening act and played, sadly, for only about 30 minutes before surrendering their custom-built stage to the following acts. That was the only disappointment of the day. We could have listened to them all night.\n\nThe remaining groups were those whom Jeff and Melissa had met along the way in their own musical travels—groups with whom they had played on the same billing and groups that they had heard and liked.\n\nThe people were wonderful. Not just Jeff and Melissa but the groups and the concert-goers, also. There were people our age (and older!) and people much younger than us. At one point, I said to Nicole, “In 1979, I was at a Grateful Dead concert. This reminds me of that!”\n\n​\n\nThe sense of community was established by the shared love of the music. My kind of place.\n\nWhile Wise Jennings played the Americana/Rock Roots style, the remaining bands all had their own genre. The band which followed Wise Jennings was a trio from Racine called Miles Over Mountain and they played bluegrass with guitar, upright bass, and mandolin. They were cool customers. Not just in their playing and in their attitudes, they were cool in the face of adversity. The sound system pretty much tanked on these guys and, knowing that there was a tight schedule to be kept, the trio stepped off the stage and continued to play with amplification while the sound engineers worked out the kinks.\n\n​\n\nThey were literally within four feet of their audience and the listeners ate it up. Grace under fire.\n\nAfter Miles Over Mountain, Pretty Beggar took the now-corrected stage. The quartet featured a lead guitar and vocalist, rhythm guitar and backing vocals, electric bass, and drums. They tended toward the heavier side of the rock category and featured a Red Hot Chili Peppers kind of vibe in the instrumentals. Nicole and I had a brief encounter with the rhythm guitar player before their set and he was the nicest guy you could hope to meet. Later, we found that we were sitting by his parents and got all kinds of back-stories on the band. These guys were dedicated to the music. As were each and every one of these bands.\n\nFollowing Pretty Beggar came Pidgin, a band described by Melissa as “Swamp Rock.” I braced for impact as that description did not sound like anything I would want to hear. It was just one more time that I found myself wrong about music.\n\nI am a bit of a Jazz snob, as I have confessed before. Sure, I listened to other forms but I was pretty well locked into my chosen category. Nicole and Wise Jennings got me to listen to other forms and I’m glad they did.\n\nSo, along comes Pidgin, the swamp-rockers. It was two guys who looked like 2/3 of ZZ Top. One played an acoustic guitar with effects pedals and the other played electric bass with a kick-bass drum which he played while standing. After a couple of songs by these guys, I turned to Nicole and said, “I have never heard anything like this.” I meant that in a good way.\n\n​\n\nThe guitarist was so imaginative in his effects and in his skill. I never expected to hear such a crafty bit of guitar work from a swamp-rocker. The bassist was right on target, as well. I should have picked up their CD.\n\nThe final act was a Ska band called Something to Do. Ska originated in Jamaica and is usually characterized by a lively and quick lines. The lyrics are rapidly strung together, so you need to pay attention. The original Ska music was kind of a mix of Jamaican mento and calypso rhythms with R&B melodies. Modern Ska sounds like New Wave or Punk accompanied by horns.\n\nSomething to Do was all of that. In addition, it was a band of comedians with each one of them making jokes with the audience and between each other. You were defied not to have fun.\n\nAll this in the face of the reality that the lead vocalist and bassist was running late because he had been caught in North Carolina and was trying to make it back from the storm to get to Wise Fest.\n\nDedicated musicians. I love ‘em.\n\nThe audience and the bands were such wonderful people and they were there because of their love for Jeff and Melissa Weishaar. So were we. We enjoyed everyone we met because they were all so much like the Weishaars. I guess it’s true that you draw people who are like you.\n\nWe can't wait for Wise Fest 2019.\n\nOver a year ago, Nicole and I were invited by BluJazz Records label owner Greg Pasenko to attend the 10th Annual Woody Fest (a continuing celebration of Jazz great Woody Hermann) and photograph and review the event in Milwaukee. The concert featured the Milwaukee Jazz Orchestra (MJO) under the direction of tenor saxophonist Curt Hanrahan.\n\nI had been writing reviews for BluJazz for five or six years and Nicole and I took Greg up on his offer. The concert was stellar (I wrote about it in the March 20, 2017 edition of the Sentinel & Rural News).\n\nWe also got to know Curt Hanrahan and his brother, drummer Warren Hanrahan. With them was Curt’s son, Tim Hanrahan, on bass. No chlorine in that gene pool! Along the way, we became pals with Warren’s wife, Maryann. Wonderful people, one and all.\n\nThis year, Greg Pasenko and Curt Hanrahan invited us to the MJO concert with Michelle Coltrane as guest vocalist and Shea Welsh as Michelle’s musical director. The concert was held at the Racine Zoological Gardens, an excellent venue for Jazz.\n\nNicole had discovered that the concert was an outdoor concert but what we didn’t know was that you needed to bring your own seating. All we had was a blanket in the trunk of the car.\n\nWe spread out the blanket only to discover that we couldn’t see when people would put their chairs in front of us. We kept moving up until…oh, yeah…we were like Bob Uecker—“On the front row!”\n\nWe met up with Maryann before the show and got an enthusiastic wave from Warren from behind his drum kit. But no Greg Pasenko yet.\n\nThe concert started almost right on time, a rare occurrence in the music world, with the mighty MJO starting off with Keith Jarrett’s The Raven Speaks. Guitarist Steve Lewandowski just cooked his solo and the orchestra was in powerful form.\n\nFrom there, they moved to a Curt Hanrahan original called Seattle. I thought it was a description of driving through the “Emerald City” but Curt came clean on the inspiration for the piece when I asked him about it last year.\n\n“It was when the Packers lost to Seattle and that ‘Fail, Mary’ pass,” Curt had confessed. It is featured on the MJO album, Welcome to Swingsville, and is one of Nicole’s favorite tunes on the CD. Eric Shore played tenor sax and wailed that piece.\n\nThe final number before being joined by Michelle Coltrane was Juan Tizol’s Caravan, made famous by the Duke Ellington Orchestra. With a big band of four saxes, four trumpets, and four trombones, plus the drums, bass, guitar, and keyboards, the zoo was lit up. Tim Hanrahan got special attention for his bass work.\n\nMichelle joined the band, after the crowd settled down from Caravan, for All the Things You Are by Jerome Kern. The song was made famous by Tommy Dorsey and Dizzy Gillespie with Charlie Parker. Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra put their stamp on it but Michelle Coltrane just owned it.\n\nAn original by Michelle, Wouldn’t It Be Nice, followed. A beautiful piece that she performed with grace and beauty.\n\nThat Old Black Magic set up a sweet surprise with Michelle singing lyrics that she wrote for her father, John Coltrane’s, song Moment’s Notice. A few years ago, I got to hear Ileana Santamaria perform her own lyrics for her father, Mongo Santamaria’s, tune Afro Blue. Something cool about hearing the lyrics that daughters write for their fathers’ songs. A nice way to end the first set.\n\nDuring the break, we got to say a few words to Curt. He was talking about the outdoor venue and the heat of the July afternoon. “You should’ve seen the rehearsal this afternoon,” he said. “We were burning.” I said, “All right, then!” “No” he corrected, “I mean burning like we were hot as can be in this sun!”\n\nThe heat didn’t die down after the break. The MJO started off with Carole King’s Jazzman. It is a great song in its own right but the MJO makes it swing. Warren and Tim Hanrahan are just hounds for the groove—they can sniff it out from a mile away. They are an amazing rhythm section. Like Curt said, “Ah, it’s in the genes.”\n\nMichelle returned for Softly As in a Morning Sunrise by Sigmund Romberg and Oscar Hammerstein II. It was also covered by John Coltrane in the 1962 album, Live! At the Village Vanguard. She followed with All of Me before Shea Welsh got his turn with his own composition Sancho T. Panza. It gave Michelle a breather but not the band. It was hotly heavy on the Latin rhythms and the band did everything Welsh could have asked.\n\nS tella by Starlight was also performed by John Coltrane with Miles Davis and Michelle turned it into one more tribute to her dad. But the sweetest tribute was her closing number, My Favorite Things. Of course, the piece is from The Sound of Music but John Coltrane took the Rodgers and Hammerstein song and made it into something truly spectacular. It was recorded when Coltrane left Miles Davis’ group so Coltrane could explore freer, more modal expressions. And it was played on soprano sax, an instrument not widely used in Jazz yet, to perfection. Curt Hanrahan boldly took the challenge and worked it beautifully. Michelle would have made Rodgers and Hammerstein and her father proud. Next to A Love Supreme, My Favorite Things is my favorite Coltrane number.\n\nSunny by Bobby Hebb was the encore number. It was the finish to a concert I hoped would never end.\n\nBut when the concert finished, we found Greg (who had only been siting about 10 feet away from us) who introduced Nicole and me to Michelle Coltrane. We got hugs and photos and I didn’t want to leave.\n\nPoor Nicole. I babbled about the concert and the song selections for the next couple of hours. Fortunately, Nicole enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\n~Travis Rogers, Jr. is The Jazz Owl\n\nAddison Agen and her brother, Korrigan, spent so much time between their home in Ft. Wayne, IN, and their grandparents’ home in Gilman, WI, that they consider Gilman home too. When Addison stormed through the TV talent show called The Voice, her grandfather became one of her biggest cheerleaders. When the show ended, Addison was the first runner-up and one TV critic proclaimed that “the best singer did not win this season.” Clearly, Addison’s devotees were dedicated.\n\nAfter the season ended, Addison returned to Gilman and performed for her grandmother and her grandmother’s fellow-residents at Thorp’s Oakbrook Health & Rehabilitation Center. She also made a stop in at Romig’s Hardware in Gilman where her proud grandfather, John Agen, could crow about his girl.\n\nAs a thank you to her extended family and second-home-city, the Gilman and Jump River Lions Club put together a concert in the Gilman High School gymnasium. Ken Klahn and the Lions got a splendid opening act, Wise Jennings—a husband and wife duo now living near Lake Geneva, WI.\n\nMelissa Weishaar was a 1994 graduate of Gilman High School and was thrilled to play before a crowd she knew so well. Addison’s mother was also a graduate of Gilman High from 1989.\n\n​ Last Saturday night, July 7, it all came together.\n\nWhen Wise Jennings took the stage at 7 p.m., the place may not have been packed but it was extremely well-attended. Melissa played drums, tambourine, harmonica and vocals. Husband Jeff Weishaar played guitars and sang, as well.\n\nHere’s the thing: I’m not a huge fan of Americana/Country music. Okay, I’m not even a small fan. Wise Jennings refer to themselves as Americana/Roots Rock and, if there is a difference, then it is all the difference. Jeff was an extremely skilled and talented guitarist. Melissa sat the minimalist drum kit and played harmonica at the same time.\n\n[The harmonica was attached to the microphone. Think of Bob Dylan or Neil Young with their harmonicas on a neck-strap.]\n\nAfter the first or second number, I leaned over to Nicole and said, \"Oh, my God. These guys are GOOD!\"\n\nMelissa was propulsive in her drumming—not just keeping time, she moved things forward, neither rushing nor lagging even once. She was good.\n\nAt one point, she kept time with the stick in her left hand and she played tambourine in her left, hitting the crash cymbal with the tambourine. And when she hit the crash cymbal, it CRASHED.\n\nAll the while, poor neglected Jeff is simply playing perfect guitar. And when Jeff and Melissa sang, they were pitch perfect. So very complementary.\n\nNot only was Jeff working the guitar, he kept a bass line alive with bass pedals like those on an organ. Jeff describes it like this: \"It is basically a 17-key organ pedal that controls a microkorg synthesizer. It rounds out the low end but, unless people really look, they don't realize what they are hearing.\"\n\nNicole and I both liked the stage set-up of Wise Jennings. They sat facing each other—Melissa on the drum throne and Jeff on the guitar stool. Comfortable with each other, reassuring each other, and focusing entirely on the music.\n\nIf it sounds like I’m gushing, it’s because I am.\n\nAs I told Melissa, I’m a bit of a Jazz snob. Actually, I’m a terrible Jazz snob but they hooked me from the opening number and I never looked back. Were they Jazzy? No. They were straight-ahead, meaningful, fun music.\n\nGo to wisejennings.com and buy their new CD. Seriously. When they finished their set, the went to the front of the stage, turned the lights on, and got a photo of themselves with Melissa’s hometown crowd behind them. These are nice people.\n\nAddison Agen and her brother, Korrigan, followed after the intermission. I admit, I did not watch The Voice but I did see repeats of her performances on YouTube. She seemed like a nice young woman and there was no doubt that she was a gifted singer.\n\nShe is 17 years old and Korrigan, who played bass, is a couple of years older. The two of them performed together for all but a couple of the songs.\n\nShe opened by praising Wise Jennings saying, “There were only two of them but it sounded like six buhzillion people up here.” She said that she wanted them to move to Ft. Wayne, “so I can see them anytime I want.”\n\nShe was a good guitarist but it was, after all, the voice that got so much attention. And rightfully so.\n\nSometimes she sounded like Lisa Loeb and sometimes like Melissa Manchester, Addison had a sense of what intonations and vocalizations were appropriate to the mood and maybe even the audience. Even at age 17, one gets the feeling that this teenager knows how to respond to a room.\n\nShe sang from her experience. That’s a big deal because nothing is worse than watching a would-be cowboy in $1,400 boots sing about sweating in the fields. Not buying it.\n\nNo, Addison would introduce the songs and tell the situation of how it came to be written or chosen. Make no mistake, she composes very well. And she writes about what it meant to be singing before a television audience of 15 million people. She wrote and sang about the changes in the one-year season she was on The Voice. If you think that she focused too much on that experience…remember that she’s only 17 years old. As she experiences more, she will write about those new experiences, too. It’s a trip worth going along.\n\nAddison is unabashedly Christian. In fact, she concluded her concert on what can only be called a worship song. It was really quite something to hear a large portion of the audience singing in response. Yeah, she has that kind of charisma.\n\nKeep your eyes on Addison Agen. And go see Wise Jennings if they are ever anywhere within driving distance.\n\n~Travis Rogers, Jr. is ​The Jazz Owl\n\n​Leonard Bernstein was America’s premier conductor of classical orchestras but he was also, without a doubt, one of America’s greatest composers—not just his orchestral music but, if for no other achievement, for the music of West Side Story. That musical bought together the perfect storm of composer Leonard Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim, and choreographer Jerome Robbins.\n\nSondheim was a young man and Bernstein wrote on November 14, 1955, “\"A young lyricist named Stephen Sondheim came and sang us some of his songs today. What a talent! I think he's ideal for this project, as do we all. The collaboration grows.\"\n\nThe music and the story—after all, it is a retelling of Shakespeare’s Rome and Juliet—have not grown stale despite the passage of over 50 years.\n\nThe setting for West Side Story is New York City in the 1950s. The turf war between the Sharks and the Jets was about the newly arrived Puerto Rican kids and the more “American” kids. But what’s missing, if anything can be said to be missing from a Bernstein masterpiece, is the Latin rhythms that would have been so familiar to the “Nuyoricans”, as they would come to be called.\n\nEnter Bobby Sanabria.\n\nSanabria is a brilliant Jazz composer and percussionist. He thinks in rhythms as much as he thinks in terms of keys and scales. Chembo Corniel once said, “Most musicians think in terms of wanting to compose in a specific key. Percussionists think in terms of composing something in 6/8 or 9/8.” Bobby brings that and more to a new music project that is certain to set things on fire.\n\nIn July, Bobby will release West Side Story, Reimagined. It is the music of Bernstein with the rhythms of Puerto Rico and other Latin styles. The project is not only about the music; it is about Puerto Rico.\n\nPuerto Rico has been devastated by hurricanes over the last two years. I talked to Bobby on the phone about the music and the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\n“Where my mom grew up, there was the best baseball field that was used for the Puerto Rican leagues. It was the best ballpark found anywhere. It was destroyed by the hurricanes. Just gone,” he described. “Not only that, but the musicians have lost their venues for playing. Some have lost their instruments. Man, they are out in the streets playing in front of kiosks, playing on street corners with buckets for spare change and these are accomplished musicians!”\n\nWorst of all, “there is still no power and it has been a year,” Bobby added. “People say, ‘Why don’t they move away?’ You can’t just move away from where you’re born! There is a spiritual connection to the place of your birth, man.”\n\nAnd Bobby himself feels that spiritual connection to the land of his parents and his family. Because of that, Bobby has put the West Side Story, Reimagined project on Kickstarter for the purpose of raising money for the relief of Puerto Rican musicians left wrecked by the storms Irma and Maria.\n\nThe Kickstarter project can be found at www.kickstarter.com/projects/845666182/west-side-story-reimagined-bobby-sanabria-big-band. Watch the video and see Bernstein’s daughter, Jamie, sing the praises of Bobby Sanabria and the Reimagined project.\n\nThe fundraiser is scheduled to end on Monday, June 4. There is still time to make a donation and pick up a donation reward of a signed CD or signed poster or even a drum lessor with Bobby.\n\nOn the Kickstarter page, Bobby writes: West Side Story is as timeless and timely now as it was back when it was first created. We’re still struggling with the same question: “How does one fight hate and how does it not consume us?” The work is a true masterpiece by probably the greatest musician this country has produced, Maestro Leonard Bernstein. This project is being produced with the blessing and support of the Leonard Bernstein Organization. Bernstein's daughter Jamie remarked: \"What I love about Bobby Sanabria's take on \"West Side Story\" music is that it's a kind of rhythm fission: my dad's music is already so drenched in rhythm. Then along comes Bobby and explodes it to an even richer rhythmic level!\"\n\nIn April, Bobby was one of the headliners at the Eau Claire Jazz Festival. UW-Eau Claire Jazz Studies director, Bob Baca, wanted Bobby Sanabria to headline this year’s festival, even though Bobby had been there several years ago. Baca got his way and Bobby returned for the best event of the last many years.\n\nBobby raved about the Eau Claire music department and had high praise for Baca’s leadership and inspiration.\n\n“That festival was on fire!” Bobby said. “Eau Claire has got to be the best kept secret in all of Jazz,” he went on. “I mean, I kind of want to keep it that way because I don’t want people pouring into Eau Claire, messing it all up!”\n\nBobby Sanabria is an astonishing artist with a heart of compassion and understanding that makes his music irresistible.\n\nIf you wan"
