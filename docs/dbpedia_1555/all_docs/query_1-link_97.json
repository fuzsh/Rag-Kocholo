        "text": "GREGG ALLMAN\n\nOne half the namesake of the Allman Brothers Band, Gregg Allman carried on with the band that bore his name for nearly 46 years after his brother Duane passed in 1971. Gregg Allman passed on May 27, 2017. The only time I ever saw the Allman Brothers Band was at an outdoor amphitheatre formerly known as Deer Creek in Noblesville, IN. JEFF BECK\n\nYardbirds...Jeff Beck Group...British Invasion...Jazz Rock Fusion...Guitar Innovator. So many things Jeff Beck can be remembered for but my introduction to Jeff Beck was his Blow By Blow record, followed by Wired and There And Back - the triple crown of jazz rock fusion. I saw Jeff Beck a couple of times, both shows were spectacular. An untimely death in January 2023, Jeff Beck was still creating new music and exploring new territory to leave an incredible legacy. WALTER BECKER (Steely Dan)\n\nBest known as the co-founder of Steely Dan, a powerhouse of 70s hit singles, Walter Becker is also remembered as an accomplished producer and guitarist. He is a Rock N Roll Hall of Fame inductee with loads of credits to his career. He was found dead following some ailments at age 67. Growing up, I never thought I might have the chance to see Steely Dan perform live. Throughout much of the 80s they were virtually inactive and were known to rarely tour. That changed in 1993 when Steely Dan reunited and resumed touring. RICK BENICK (Roadmaster)\n\nA truly gifted guitarist with amazing tone, Rick Benick was a founding member of Roadmaster, who were signed to Village/Mercury Records in the late 1970s into the early 1980s. After recording four studio records with Roadmaster and the Live +5 record, Benick joined Henry Lee Summer's band and later The Alligator Brothers, who performed mostly bars and clubs. Benick was diagnosed with Leukemia and battled the disease until his death in 2018. PAUL BARRERE (Litte Feat)\n\nIt seems every year this is becoming more and more sad, but mortal we are. We lost Paul Barrere on October 26, 2019. He was one of the very talented guitarists of Little Feat, who always were an enjoyable band in my view. I saw them a couple of times and I will always remember them as a band that catches fire somewhere in the set. Sometimes at the beginning. Sometimes at the encore. Sometimes in the middle somewhere. But you never wanted to miss them when they caught fire. DAVID BOWIE\n\nA true artist in the world of popular music and film, David Bowie re-invented himself over and over throughout his career. I saw David Bowie late in his career actually, on the Reality Tour. The performance was outstanding and included a wide scope of his catalog. Bowie lost a battle with cancer January 10, 2016\n\nDANNY JOE BROWN (Molly Hatchet)\n\nBest known as the original and best singer for Molly Hatchet, Danny also fronted his own solo act, The Danny Joe Brown Band, for a short period in the early 1980s. His voice resonated with whiskey laced, gator country southern rock n roll. I saw Danny play with Molly Hatchet only once in the arly days of Molly Hatchet, as the opening act for Kansas in 1979.\n\nRUSTY BURNS (Point Blank)\n\nTexas blues guitarist Rusty Burns was a mainstay of the band, Point Blank. Died February 19, 2016 after a long battle with lung cancer.\n\nCLIVE BURR (Iron Maiden)\n\nIron Maiden drummer Clive Burr passed in 2013. I saw him with Iron Maiden on their Number of the Beast tour opening for Rainbow and 38 Special tour as well as the Scorpions Blackout tour of North America.\n\nERIC CARR (KISS)\n\nThe fifth member of KISS and the fifth person in KISS make-up, Eric Carr filled some very big shoes left by Peter Criss. A charming person that he was, Eric became a favorite among KISS fans. I saw Eric perform with KISS both in make-up for the 10th Anniversary tour supporting Creatures of The Night and unmasked for subsequent tours through the Lick It Up and Animalize eras. JOHN CASCELLA (John Mellencamp Band)\n\nJohn J. Cascella, a keyboardist for rock singer John Mellencamp, died of a heart attack in 1992. Authorities believe he suffered a heart attack while driving. Cascella had also played in various regional bands in the Indianapolis area, such as The Chosen Few. I saw Cascella perform as part of John Mellencamp's band. DAVID CASSIDY (The Partridge Family)\n\nDavid Cassidy's music career will be forever shadowed by his teen-idol status in the 1970s as Keith Partridge of the hit television series, The Partridge Family. Yet, despite the campy tv show, Cassidy was an accomplished musician and singer in his own right. Between 1974 and 2007, Cassidy released ten solo studio albums, two live records and a host of Greatest Hits compilations. I saw The Partridge Family at Kings Island, while they were filming the episode \"I Left My Heart In Cincinnati\" which aired in 1973. My sister was an extra in the episode. BOBBY CHOINARD (Billy Squier Band)\n\nProbably an obscure name to many, Bobby was a drummer among drummers. He may be best remembered as the drummer for the Billy Squier band. Bobby also played drums for Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Peter Wolf and Richie Scarlet among many others. I saw Bobby perform with Billy Squier several times between the tours for Don't Say No, Emotions In Motion and Signs of Life. STEVE CLARK (Def Leppard)\n\nA sad loss for the guitar community and a sad loss for Def Leppard fans, Steve was the guitarist for On Through The Night, High and Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria. I saw Steve perform with Def Leppard twice on their epic Pyromania tour. CHRIS CORNELL (Soundgarden)\n\nThe only time I saw Soundgarden was 2013 at the MayDay Festival in Noblesville, IN. Great show. It is always sad to see someone as creative and talented as Chris Cornell take his own life...if that is even true. Several theories persist that suggest not suicide. DAVID CROSBY\n\nCrosby was a gifted vocalist and harmonizer with an amazing list of hits with Crosby Stills and Nash (and sometimes Young), The Byrds, and a solo career with and without a variety of musician friends. I saw him with Crsoby Stills and Nash only once. David Crosby was 81.\n\nROBBIN CROSBY (Ratt)\n\nA tragic loss to the sunset strip music scene of the 80's, Robben fell victim to drug use and needles, which led to further health and immune complications. Robben played guitar for Ratt, whose career as a band had blown wide open with the release of Out of The Cellar and a radio smash called Round and Round. I saw Robben with Ratt, opening for Billy Squier. Ratt N Roll.\n\nBRUCE CRUMP (Molly Hatchet)\n\nDied March 16, 2015 of throat cancer at age 57. Bruce was part of Molly Hatchet for the glory years of 1976 - 1982. My first Molly Hatchet show was 1979 when they stole the show from headliners Kansas\n\nKIM DAVIS (Point Blank)\n\nI saw Point Blank only once, as the opening act for Canadian rockers, Triumph. Point Blank was enjoying some success around that time with their single, Nicole. JOHN DENVER\n\nActor, activist, musician, John Denver wore many hats and touched many lives with his work. He was a featured performer at Farm Aid IV in Indianapolis, when I saw him perform. John passed when his small plane crashed in 1997. RONNIE JAMES DIO (Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio)\n\nDespite the haunting, medieval and devilish themes of his lyrics, fans and the music community broadly regard Ronnie James Dio as one of the kindest and most generous icons of modern musicians. Ronnie was the voice of the original version of Richie Blackmore's Rainbow. From there, he went on to front Black Sabbath for Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules. After a falling out with Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio became simply Dio and forged a solid solo act with the help of talented musicians. I saw Ronnie James only once with Black Sabbath on the Mob Rules tour. Outstanding show.\n\nKEITH EMERSON (Emerson, Lake and Palmer)\n\nApparent suicide, March 10/11, 2016. Age 71. I saw an amazing arena show headlined by Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Cozy Powell in the 1980's and again much later, a theatre show featuring only Greg Lake and Keith Emerson. He was a legendary composer and keyboardist.\n\nDOUG FIEGER (The Knack)\n\nYou may not know the name, but Doug Fieger fronted The Knack. They were briefly mega popular with hits like My Sharona and Good Girls Dont. I saw The Knack open for Roadmaster at the Convention Center in Indianapolis. FERGIE FREDERIKSEN (Toto)\n\nWhile Fergie Frederikson was a lead singer of the group Toto for a period of time, he was also involved with other bands and projects, such as Trillion and Le Roux. I saw Frederikson perform with a touring act called World Class Rockers, which was kind of an all-star line-up of musicians who had formerly been associated with other classic rock bands at some point in their career. GLENN FREY (The Eagles)\n\nWhile I never saw Glenn Frey perform with the Eagles, I did see a co-headline show featuring Glenn Frey and Joe Walsh. The other Eagles at that time had not thawed their differences, so Frey and Walsh performed on one stage together, sharing the same band and exchanging the spotlight. Frey died from mixed health complications January 18, 2016. ALLAN FRYER (Heaven)\n\nAllan Fryer was lead singer of the hard rock group, Heaven, from Australia. While Heaven did not make a major splash in America, they did record a few full length records and a video filmed atop a butte for \"Knockin On Heavens Door.\" Fryer auditioned for AC/DC when original singer Bon Scott passed away. Of course he lost out to Brian Johnson. Fryer himself passed in 2015 after losing a battle with cancer. RORY GALLAGHER\n\nUnfortunately I learned about Rory Gallagher's music legacy much too late. I saw hime perform in Dayton, OH, opening for RUSH. I didnt have much knowledge of the Irish guitarist then. Of course later, I came to appreciate the fact that I had seen a blues-rock legend perform that night. Gallagher died June 14, 1995 due to severe liver damage and MRSA infection. JERRY GARCIA (Grateful Dead)\n\nChili Dogs with Cheese, Heroin, Acid, Diabetes...all the things that threatened to end the life of one of rock's most illustrious figures. Garcia did things his way and apparently enjoyed the life he lead. When he passed, it left a giant void in a certain part of the world, particularly the spinners and wharf rats, summer followers and trippers, the sketti lady outside the shows and tens of thousands of others who just came along to see the spectacle of a Grateful Dead show.\n\nJEFF GOLUB (Billy Squier, Rod Stewart, others)\n\nJeff Golub passed at the age of 59. He was described as having a very rare brain neuro disease that ultimately took his life. The accomplished guitarist rose to success as part of the Billy Squier band during Billy's hayday. From there, Golub dabbled in jazz fusion as a solo artist and toured with John Waite and Rod Stewart. He also fronted the smooth jazz outfit, Avenue Blue and enjoyed a successful solo career in smooth jazz as well. I saw Jeff play with Billy Squier numerous times.\n\nDUSTY HILL (ZZ TOP)\n\nAlong with Frank Beard, Dusty Hill held down the rhythm section of ZZ TOP since the beginning. Unfortunately Dusty passed in his sleep in 2021. He had been suffering a broken shoulder and broken hip. ZZ TOP was legendary and their shows never failed to entertain. I saw ZZ TOP in 1981 on the El Loco Tour, in 1983 on the Eliminator Tour and finally again in 2007 when they toured with The Pretenders and The Stray Cats. DAVE HLUBEK (Molly Hatchet)\n\nWith the passing of Dave Hlubek, there are not many original members of Molly Hatchet still living. I last saw Hlubek with Molly Hatchet at a Rib America Fest in Indianapolis, 2002. Of course, I had seen Molly Hatchet in the hayday as well, the classic line-up opened for KANSAS at Market Square Arena in 1979 STEVE HOLLAND (Molly Hatchet)\n\nDied August 3, 2020 at age 66. He was a founding member of Molly Hatchet. STEVEN ISHAM (Autograph)\n\nDied at age 56 after battling cancer in December 2008. I saw Autograph on their first tour through the midwest, headlining a WEBN free show at Bogarts. Turn Up The Radio. JIMI JAMISON (Survivor)\n\nVia MelodicRockFest events, I met Jimi Jamison and saw him perform a few times. Of course seeing him perform with former Survivor band mate, Jim Peterik was electric. Clearly a professional and seemingly well grounded guy, I was shocked to learn that cause of death included acute methamphetamine intoxication KELLY JOHNSON (Girlschool)\n\nThe guitarist for UK based Girlschool died of spinal cancer July 15, 2007. I saw her with Girlschool opening for Scorpions in 1982, as well as Deep Purple in 1985. LARRY JUNSTROM (38 Special)\n\nAlthough a very early member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Larry Junstrom is probably best remembered for his tenure with 38 Special. I first saw them open for RUSH in 1980, then I saw them when they shared a co-headline bill with Rainbow in 1982. I think the very last time I saw them was when they opened for Sammy Hagar in 2003. PHIL KENNEMORE (Y&T)\n\nBest known to many as the bass player and founding member of the band Y&T. Although late in Kennemore's career, I saw him with Y&T in Elgin, IL at the Melodic Rock Festival. LEMMY KILMEISTER (Motorhead)\n\nLemmy was more of a legend than simply another player on a list of credits. He di everything his own way with a unique British Metal swagger that left audiences in awe. I managed to see Lemmy and Motothead only a few short months before his passing December 28, 2015. B.B. KING\n\nI was fortunate to see B.B. King a couple of times late in his career. He was everything a legendary guitar player should be. RIP. BOB KULICK (Meatloaf, Blackthorne)\n\nOlder brother of KISS guitarist Bruce Kulick, Bob was also an accomplished guitarist, having had several studio stints himself with KISS, Lou Reed and Meatloaf. Bob was also a member of Blacthorne, with Graham Bonnet, Jimmy Waldo, Frankie Banali and Chuck Wright. Bob passed away May 29, 2020 age 70. No cause of death was published. JEFF LaBAR (Cinderella)\n\nCinderella guitarist Jeff LaBar passed far too early at the age of 58. He was belived to have passed peacefully July 14, 2021. I saw CInderella only once at Rock-Fest 2006 in Cadott, Wisconsin. GREG LAKE (Emerson, Lake and Palmer)\n\nWhen most people think of ELP, they probably think of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer. I tend to think of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Cozy Powell, which was a one off formation of the band, however it was the version of ELP that I saw perform live. First Powell, then Emerson and now Greg Lake have all passed on. Lake was 69 and had battled cancer. ALLEN LANIER (Blue Oyster Cult)\n\nI saw BOC on a headline tour with new comers Dokken and Aldo Nova. I learned about Blue Oyster Cult mostly from a friend who had a few classic BOC records. He told me about the laser light shows and the walking godzilla monster on stage. Thankfully they still had the godzilla when I saw them. Lanier died from C.O.P.D. in 2013\n\nALVIN LEE (Ten Years After)\n\nI saw Alvin Lee perform as a solo act, opening for Black Sabbath in 1980. Sadly, I had little appreciation at that time for Alvin Lee. As fate would have it, two musicians who performed that night have now passed on, Alvin Lee and Ronnie James Dio.\n\nJON LORD (Deep Purple)\n\nI saw Deep Purple twice. Once with Girlschool, as mentioned above, in Cincinnati, OH 1985. I wouldnt see them again until 2007 in Cadott, WI at RockFest. Lord suffered from pancreatic cancer and died July 16, 2012. STEVE MacNALLY (Roadmaster)\n\nMac was a Kokomo, Indiana native like myself, but several years older. He grew up there and fronted several garage bands. One of those bands practiced in my Dad's girlfriend's garage. He pumped gas at a local Marathon station on Markland Avenue. His bands played rough neck places like the Pumpkinvine Room where broken beer bottles were the staple weapons of any good brawl. Steve then joined Roadmaster. Things seemed to really launch for the band. There were a few reunions, the last show was to benefit Steve, who had cancer. PHIL McCORMACK (Molly Hatchet)\n\nDied April 29, 2019 - Phil was hand picked by Danny Joe Brown to be his successor in Molly Hatchet.\n\nFREDDIE MERCURY (Queen)\n\nThe amazing Freddie Mercury was an unparalleled performer and a singer without peers. An original frontman if there ever was one and original singer of Queen. I enjoyed the opportunity to see Queen while their popularity in the US was still quite high. Personally, I find it unfortunate that the band has even attempted to carry on with other singers as there is no suitable replacement for Freddie. EDDIE MONEY\n\nThe money man, Eddie Money passed away at the age of 70, September 13, 2019. Money recently revealed he was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. I had always been a fan of his records and saw Eddie Money as an artist who was true to his roots in blues, rock n roll and RnB. Sure there was the raucus party side of Eddie's music, but there was also a very personal and soulful side that he exposed from time to time that always spoke to me. RONNIE MONTROSE\n\nUnfortunately, I never saw the group Montrose, featuring Ronnie Montrose of course. I did however see Ronnie with another one of his bands called Gamma. Despite a very talented and capable line-up, Gamma came along just at the end of the 70's and beginning of the 80's and to a greater extent, they probably fell through the cracks. Never the less, I did see Ronnie Montrose with Gamma, opening for none other than AC/DC on their Back In Black tour.\n\nBRENT MYDLAND (Grateful Dead)\n\nThe Grateful Dead fell upon some difficult years, what with the losses of Brent Mydland, Vince Welnick and eventually Jerry Garcia himself. I saw Brent with the band a few times before he passed.\n\nJAMIE OLDAKER (Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton, Frehley's Comet)\n\nDrummer and Tulsa, OK native, Jamie Oldaker played extensively with Eric Clapton in the 70's and 80's, Peter Frampton, Bob Seger and many others, but when I met him he was the drummer for Ace Frehley's solo band, Frehley's Comet. Oldaker replaced session drummer Anton Fig for touring and the Second Sighting record. Oldaker died July 16, 2020\n\nJOHN PANOZZO (Styx)\n\nI only saw John Panozzo once with Styx many years ago at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. The late 70s shows were the best in my book.\n\nNEIL PEART (Rush)\n\nNeil's contribution to modern drumming is peerless. With Peart, Rush released 18 studio records (Peart is not credited on the eponymous first record), 11 live records, and 13 home videos. In addition, he spearheaded the Volume 1 and 2 recordings, Burning For Buddy, a drum tribute to jazz great Buddy Rich. Neil Peart lost a battle with brain cancer in January 2020. I saw him on various Rush tours including Permanent Waves, Signals, Roll The Bones, Snakes And Arrows, and Clockwork Angels COZY POWELL (Jeff Beck Group, Rainbow, Whitesnake, Emerson, Lake and Powell)\n\nCozy Powell played with many bands and as a solo artist, however I saw him perform with Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of the 70's progressive rock band, ELP. This time around, still ELP, with Powell replacing Palmer. An incredible show to say the least, and the arena was near empty that night. LOU REED\n\nSo much can be said for Lou Reed, an american poet of the glam era and rock 70s. His work often under appreciated and under rated, includes Velvet Underground and solo and collaborative work. His performance at Farm Aid IV was one of the highlights of the day for me and the album he supported at that time was called New York, a collection of songs that played almost like a diary of Reed's neighborhood and life in Manhattan at the time. Still one of my all time favorite records. JOHN REGAN\n\nMaster bass player John Regan played for Peter Frampton, Frehley's Comet, Ace Frehley and Mick Jagger/David Bowie. John passed away April 2023. RANDY RHOADS (Ozzy Osbourne, Quiot Riot)\n\nThe incomparable Randy Rhoads. Who knows where his career may have taken him, had it not been for the fatal plane crash that took his life. I saw Randy with Ozzy Osbourne's band not long at all before the crash itself. A friend called me to ask if I had heard the news and I had not. I remember thinking, I just saw him here in Indianapolis a few weeks ago... KENI RICHARDS (Autograph)\n\nCo-founding member and drummer for 80s rock band, Autograph. Richards died at age 60. I remember seeing Autograph perform a club gig at Bogarts in Cincinnati, January 1985. The show was being promoted by a local radio station. Tickets were either free or next to nothingto get in. Due to an ice storm there was vittually no one there, but the show rocked! DUANE ROLAND (Molly Hatchet)\n\nFounding member and guitarist for the southern rock outfit, Molly Hatchet. Roland died of natural causes at age 53. Like band mate Danny Joe Brown, I saw Duane Roland play with Molly Hatchet when they opened for Kansas in 1979. GARY ROSSINGTON (Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rossington Collins Band)\n\nFounding member and guitarist for the southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd. Rossington passed March 5, 2023 at age 71. I saw Lynyrd Skynyrd only once or twice with Rossington, notably 2009 with Kid Rock and Cross Canadian Ragweed. BON SCOTT (AC/DC)\n\nThe original and still my favorite lead singer of AC/DC. He was just grittier and growlier than Brian Johnson. If you happen to watch the DVD, AC/DC Family Jewels, it features a lot of Bon Scott and an appreciation for him as a person. Bon Scott was the singer for AC/DC when I saw them in 1977, opening for KISS. KIM SIMMONDS (Savoy Brown)\n\nDied December 13, 2022, Simmonds led the British blues outfit Savoy Brown which formed around 1965 and continued well into the 2000s through numerous line-up changes. I saw Savoy Brown with Simmonds in 2005 at Rock Fest in Cadott, WI. SCOTT SMITH (Loverboy)\n\nDied 11/30/2000 as he was swept overboard while sailing near Golden Gate Bridge by San Francisco. I saw Loverboy touring in support o ftheir debut Loverboyt record, opening act for ZZ Top that year. JACK SONNI (Dire Straits)\n\nAlthough not a founding member, Jack Sonni from New York City became a touring guitarist for Dire Straits in 1985 for the Brothers In Arms World Tour. Of course the show I saw on this tour at Blossom Music Center near Cleveland is among my top 5 concerts of all time. Sonni passed at age 68 on August 30, 2023 JAKSON SPIRES (Blackfoot)\n\nDied 03/16/2005 from a brain aneurysm CHRIS SQUIRE (YES)\n\nCo-founder of the progressive rock group, YES, Chris Squire was a member of the group from its inception in 1968 until 2015, when he took a break from touring to address health issues. While the group saw many roster changes throughout decades of recording and touring, Squire was the only mainstay. Born March 4, 1948, Squire lost his battle with Leukemia in 2015. Over many years, I enjoyed Chris White and his bass solo at various YES concerts. MICHAEL STANLEY (Michael Stanley Band)\n\nFounder and frontman of the Michael Stanley Band passed on March 5, 2021. Stanley had endured several health issues, but suffered lung cancer. MSB was hugely popular in Ohio, particularly their hometown of Cleveland. The one and only time I saw them...1979 as support for the KISS Dynasty Tour in Indianapolis. WAYNE STATIC (Static X)\n\nFounder and frontman of the metal group Static-X found dead after OD. Coroner reported a lethal mixture of oxycodone and alcohol as cause of death. Static died just days before his 49th birthday. I first met Wayne Static who was on a co-headline tour with Powerman 5000 in Indianapolis. While I did not attend that show, I later saw Static-X headline a 4 way bill with American Headcharge, 10 Years and Bloodsimple.\n\nPETER STEELE (Type O Negative)\n\nBorn January 4, 1962 Petrus Thomas Ratajczyk, but known to goth metal fans as Peter Steele. Steele died April 2010 of an aortic aneurysm. I saw Type O with a few other hard core band in Cincinnati.\n\nROBBY STEINHARDT (Kansas)\n\nFormer singer and violinist for the American progressive rock group, KANSAS, passed on Saturday July 17, 2021. He had complications from pancreatitus. Aside from being an original member of Kansas, it was Steinhardt's distinctive violin that set the group apart from their contemporaries of the time such as Yes, Styx and others. JIMMY STOKLEY (Exile)\n\nFormer singer for the band Exile, with the hit Kiss You All Over, Stokley had complications from hepatitis and died in a hospital emergency room August 13,1985. I saw Exile as opening act for Aerosmith in 1978. BANNER THOMAS (Molly Hatchet)\n\nFounding member and bass guitarist for the southern rock outfit, Molly Hatchet. Roland died of a heart attack at age 60. Like band mates Dan Joe Brown and Duane Roland, I saw Banner Thomas play with Molly Hatchet when they opened for Kansas in 1979. BUTCH TRUCKS (Allman Brothers Band)\n\nFounding member and drummer for the Allmand Brothers and performed with the band for 45 years or more. Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at age 69. I saw Trucks with the Allman Brothers in Nobleville, IN at Deer Creek Music Center in 1992. BRIT TURNER (Blackberry Smoke)\n\nDrummer for the popular Southern rock band Blackberry Smoke, died in 2024 at age 57 from cancer. I saw Blackberry Smoke a few times with Turner, notably as a headline show in Lafayette, IN. EDDIE VAN HALEN (Van Halen)\n\nWe knew it was coming but still shocking that guitar legend Eddie Van Halen lost a 10 year battle with cancer Oct 06, 2020. Plans for a tour that would have re-united original members Eddie, brother and drummer Alex Van Halen, singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony was scrapped due to health issues in 2019. I met Eddie in 2004 at a Van Halen show in Noblesville, Indiana. Eddie Van Halen. Influential. Iconic. Legendary. The King of 10 fingers and 6 strings. KARL WALLINGER (Waterboys / World Party)\n\nThe talented songwriter, performer and leader of World Party died from a stroke at his home in Hastings in March 2024, age 66. Wallinger created some amazing music with World Party. I was fortunate emough to see World Party at a very small Indianapolis venue in 2014. CHARLIE WATTS (Rolling Stones)\n\nThe backbeat to a generation, Charlie Watts was 80 when he passed on August 24, 2021. I saw the Rolling Stones only once on the Voodoo Lounge tour. They played everything I wante dto hear and the show was SO GOOD, I never wanted to see them again. RIP Charlie. BOB WELCH (Fleetwood Mac)\n\nBob Welch was essential to Fleetwood Mac to me. Hypnotized was and still is one of my favorite FM songs. His first solo outing, French Kiss, featured vocals from Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie. I saw Welch on the French Kiss tour. He opened for Styx. VINCE WELNICK (Tubes, Grateful Dead)\n\nIt always comes as some kind of shock when rock stars pass away. I suppose it should not. It is amazing how many members of the Grateful Dead have passed, more amazing the number of those still living. Following the loss of Vince Welnick, the Grateful Dead did pick up Bruce Hornsby to play keyboards for a short time. JOHN WETTON (King Crimson, Asia)\n\nListening to some of the more recent ASIA work that has been recorded in the past decade, Wetton's voice sounded timeless, with little or no detectable loss of fidelity compared to the early ASIA records. For that reason, it was a bit of a shock when John Wetton passed January 31, 2017 after losing a battle with colon cancer."
