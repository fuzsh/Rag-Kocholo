I don’t subscribe to that notion, which is why my list has no order.\n\nListed below are the 50 best drummers of all time, according to me. They happen to be my favorite drummers, as well. But what do I know; I’m just a blogger on the internet? Feel free to voice your opinions in the comments! These lists seem to be somewhat controversial.\n\nSome drummers listed here may be popular and famous while others are “better musicians” according to subjective opinion (this is why these lists are tough).\n\nWill your favorite drummer be included in my list? Read on to find out.\n\nTaylor Hawkins\n\nRest in peace, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Hawkins was a drummer best known for his work with the rock band Foo Fighters. He first joined the group in 1997 and has been a member ever since. In addition to his work with Foo Fighters, Hawkins played with Queens of the Stone Age, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders, and Probot. He has also released several solo albums. Hawkins is regarded as one of the best drummers of the 90s.\n\nTaylor Hawkins was an incredibly versatile drummer, and his unique style has helped to shape the sound of Foo Fighters over the years. He was known for his powerful drumming, as well as his ability to seamlessly switch between different genres. Whether he was laying down a groove for a rock song or providing a steady beat for a ballad, Taylor Hawkins always delivered.\n\nZak Starkey\n\nZak Starkey (b. September 13, 1965) hardly needs any introduction. The English drummer is the son of The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and has recorded with The Who since 1996. He also has worked with the English rock band Oasis.\n\nTre Cool\n\nFrank Edwin Wright III (b. December 9, 1972), otherwise known for his stage name Tré Cool, has held the backbeat for punk rockers Green Day since their second album.\n\nTre’s drumming style is energetic and bombastic; he mentions The Who as a significant influence growing up and it shows. He’s one of the best pop punk drummers of all time.\n\nGreen Day was one of my favorite acts growing up. I was big into pop punk music for a while. Skateboarding was my biggest passion and their music was great to listen to while riding. It also happened to be right about the time I started playing the drums.\n\nBill Ward\n\nWilliam Thomas Ward (b. May 5, 1948) is best known for his work with Black Sabbath. In the era of great British drummers (Bonham, Palmer, Paice), Bill Ward’s playing stood out from the rest. His playing with Sabbath was absolutely an influence on my playing and still is to this day.\n\nAlan White\n\nProgressive rockers Yes gained a bit of attention over the last few years as the song “Roundabout” was a viral meme known as To Be Continued.\n\nAlan White (b. June 14, 1949) is an English drummer and songwriter most known for his work in Yes, following Bill Bruford’s departure. After the death of Chris Squire in 2015, White became the longest-remaining member in Yes.\n\nCarl Palmer\n\nMost known for his work with ELP and Asia, Carl Palmer (b. March 20, 1950) deserves a spot on my list. Carl was fortunate to come from a very musical family.\n\nHis grandfather played the drum set, and his grandmother played violin in a symphony. Palmer has stated that his primary influence growing up was Gene Krupa.\n\nMichael Shrieve\n\nMichael Shrieve (b. July 6, 1949) is most known for his work in the rock band Santana. In addition to being a fantastic drummer, Shrieve has composed music for many films including Tempest and Apollo 13.\n\nMatt Cameron\n\nMatthew David Cameron (b. November 28, 1962) is currently the drummer of Pearl Jam, but he got his start playing with acts like Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, and Skin Yard.\n\nMatt Cameron has played with Queens of the Stone Age and even was featured on Geddy Lee’s solo album, My Favorite Headache.\n\nMike Portnoy\n\nAfter discovering Neil Peart, I discovered Mike Portnoy. I have never been the biggest fan of the music written by Dream Theater, but I can appreciate the drumming.\n\nMike has a way of taking the ideas and techniques of 70s prog rock drumming and upping the ante. It’s always awesome to watch him play, whether its old clips from DT or newer videos from The Winery Dogs. Mike Portnoy is considered to be one of the best metal drummers of all time.\n\nJeff Porcaro\n\nJeff Porcaro was one of the most in-demand drummers of his generation. A native of Los Angeles, Jeff started playing drums at an early age and quickly developed a reputation as a talented and versatile musician.\n\nHe played on some of the most iconic records of the 1970s and 1980s, including Steely Dan’s “Pretzel Logic” and Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.” In addition to his session work, Jeff was also a member of the Grammy-winning rock band Toto. He tragically passed away in 1992 at the age of 38, but his legacy continues to live on through his music.\n\nDanny Carey\n\nDanny Carey was another giant inspiration for me in high school. Born May 10, 1961, Danny is the drummer for the progressive metal band Tool. Carey has also worked with bands like Pigmy Love Circus, Volto!, and Primus.\n\nDave Grohl\n\nNow, here’s a drummer with an extensive background. Dave Grohl, the drummer for Nirvana and lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters, is an incredible drummer. No one can deny it.\n\nOne of Grohl’s most recent pieces is Play, a 23-minute song, and mini-documentary that’s well worth a watch. Fans of energetic guitar and drum music will love it.\n\nChad Smith\n\nChad Smith holds a special place in my heart. Growing up, the album Californication was on repeat on way to and from school in my CD player.\n\nChad plays some of the funkiest grooves and is a fantastic drummer; remember the drum battle between him and Will Ferrel?\n\nKeith Moon\n\nKeith Moon laid the foundation for rock drummers of the late twentieth century and onward. His larger-than-life playing style and bombastic drum fills served The Who perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately, Keith was taken from the world too soon.\n\nBuddy Rich\n\nBuddy Rich was a legendary drummer who was known for his virtuoso technique and lightning-fast speed. Born Bernard Rich in 1917, he began playing drums at the age of two and made his first professional appearance at the age of four.\n\nHe quickly developed a reputation as a prodigy, and by the 1930s he was touring with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw.\n\nIn a career that spanned five decades, Rich recorded and performed with many of the greatest names in music, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and Miles Davis. He also led his own big band, which was renowned for its high-energy performances. Buddy Rich died in 1987, but his legacy as one of the greatest drummers of all time lives on.\n\nBuddy Rich is the king of the “one-handed roll” and had a profound impact on my playing growing up. His drumming was so fluid, yet technical. He made everything look simple.\n\nArt Blakey\n\nArt Blakey was a legendary drummer who helped to shape the sound of modern jazz. Born in Pittsburgh in 1919, Blakey began playing drums at an early age and soon developed a unique style that emphasized complex rhythms and powerful solos.\n\nHe made his first recordings in the 1940s, and by the 1950s he was leading his own band, the Jazz Messengers. Over the course of his career, Blakey recorded hundreds of albums and played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Miles Davis and John Coltrane.\n\nHe also mentored many young musicians, including Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis. Art Blakey died in 1990, but his legacy continues to influence jazz percussionists around the world.\n\nI can’t begin to describe how influential Art Blakey was to my playing. When I was younger, I would play “Moanin'” on repeat, even learning the piano part for no reason.\n\nPhilly Joe Jones\n\nPhilly Joe Jones (b. July 15, 1923 – August 30, 1985) needs no introduction. Jones was the drummer for the First Great Miles Davis Quintet. He can be heard on albums like Porgy and Bess, Cookin’ with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Milestones.\n\nJones also was a bandleader, releasing albums from 1957 to 1983.\n\nPhilly Joe Jones made appearances with famous jazz musicians such as Chris Anderson, Chet Baker, Evans Bradshaw, Clifford Brown, Kenny Burrell, Joe Castro, John Coltrane, and others.\n\nGinger Baker\n\nGinger Baker (b. August 19, 1939) is a drummer and founder of the English rock band Cream. Baker is touted as being “rock’s first superstar drummer.”\n\nDespite having major influences from jazz and African rhythms, jazz fusion heavy metal, and world music were his eventual wheelhouses.\n\nBaker has cited Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, and Philly Joe Jones as main influences on his playing. While Cream’s didn’t always lean to jazz, Ginger brought it out. Baker was also similar in many ways to The Who’s Keith Moon.\n\nSometimes, however, jazz cuts through, whether in the form of the ride patterns or archetypal drumming, such as in the piece “Toad.”\n\nStewart Copeland\n\nDuring my touring days when I drove, I had The Police on non-stop. Stewart Copeland is one of my favorite drummers. His playing on Ghost In The Machine is extraordinary.\n\nStewart is famous for four-on-the-floor patterns, off-beat hi-hat syncopation, and reggae half-time shuffles; these grooves are heard throughout GITM.\n\nCharlie Watts\n\nCharlie Watts was a legend in the music world. As the drummer for The Rolling Stones, he helped to define the sound of rock and roll. Over the course of his career, Charlie developed a unique style that combines power and precision.\n\nHe was also known for his showmanship, often throwing in a few extra licks or flourishes to get the crowd going. Charlie’s drumming was a major part of The Rolling Stones’ success, and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\nCharlie continued to tour with The Rolling Stones until his untimely death in 2021 at the age of 80.\n\nMitch Mitchell\n\nMitch Mitchell was an unbelievable drummer: perfect for the Jimi Hendrix band.\n\nOne of my favorite tunes to drum along with to this day is Fire. It’s a moderately fast song and features crazed fills that manage to fit the music very well.\n\nIan Paice\n\nIan Paice is a drummer best known for his work with the hard rock band Deep Purple. Paice is considered one of the greatest drummers of all time, and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Mojo Hall of Fame.\n\nPaice began his career as a session musician, playing on tracks for artists such as The Beatles and Cream. He joined Deep Purple in 1968, and helped to define the sound of their early albums.\n\nIn addition to playing with Deep Purple, Paice has also played with Whitesnake, Gary Moore, and Ian Gillan. He remains an active member of Deep Purple, touring and recording with the band to this day. Ian Paice is a true legend of rock music, and his contributions have had a lasting impact on the genre.\n\nIan Paice has been compared to John Bonham and vice-versa. I actually just read through a comment thread debating who was better. Why? Both Ian and John are incredible drummers. We’ll leave it at that!\n\nAsh Soan\n\nI discovered Ash Soan on Instagram where he posts tons of clips in his famed Windmill Recording Studio. His playing is nothing short of incredible and tasteful. Soan’s session drumming credits include Cee Lo Green, Adele, Clare Maguire, Will Young, David Cook, and many more.\n\nRingo Starr\n\nRingo Starr is a singer, songwriter and actor best known for his work as the drummer for the Beatles. Ringo’s real name is Richard Starkey, and he was born in Liverpool, England, in 1940.\n\nRingo first joined the Beatles in 1962, after their original drummer, Pete Best, was fired. Ringo quickly became an integral part of the band, both musically and personality-wise. He brought a sense of humor and fun to the group, which helped to offset the sometimes tense atmosphere between John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nRingo also proved to be a capable songwriter, co-writing such Beatles classics as “Octopus’s Garden” and “Don’t Pass Me By.” After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ringo went on to enjoy a successful solo career, scoring such hits as “It Don’t Come Easy” and “Photograph.”\n\nRingo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as aBeatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015. Ringo Starr is truly one of the greatest drummers of all time.\n\nMax Weinberg\n\nMax Weinberg spent most of his career playing drums with Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band but also was the bandleader for Conan O’Brien on Late Night and the Tonight Show.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the E Street Band in 1989, Max went for an audition as a bandleader for Late Night. Max quickly recruited the Max Weinberg 7, a group of musicians he had worked with during his career. Needless to say, he got the gig.\n\nWeinberg was often involved in humorous banter with O’Brien leading to many memorable moments throughout the show’s history.\n\nTerry Bozzio\n\nThe phrase “Keep It Simple, Stupid” simply does not apply to Terry Bozzio. His massive kit may seem unnecessary, but his musicality and drumming prowess make up for it.\n\nOne of Bozzio’s most famous performances is “The Black Page” by Frank Zappa. Terry was joined on stage alongside Zappa and Steve Vai.\n\nBernard Purdie\n\nGrowing up, my dad always played Steely Dan records in his car stereo, one of which was Aja. I never had a clue that this album would become one of my favorites.\n\nBernard Purdie is one of many drummers who play on the record (Gadd, Greene, Marotta, among others). His performance on Home At Last features what is known as the Purdie Shuffle, a triplet-based shuffle groove with half-time feel.\n\nIf you haven’t learned how to play the Purdie Shuffle, learn it now. You can thank me later.\n\nSimon Phillips\n\nSimon Phillips is absolutely in my top-ten favorite drummers. He’s played with some incredible musicians, especially with piano virtuoso Hiromi.\n\nI only recently discovered Hiromi’s album Alive by mistake, only to find out Simon Phillips plays on it alongside her and Anthony Jackson. I can’t stop listening to it.\n\nSimon’s approach to linear drumming has had a big impact on my drumming as of late. Tunes like Dreamer from Alive are a perfect example of linear playing.\n\nCarmine Appice\n\nWhen I was first starting on the drums, one of the first books I learned from was Ultimate Realistic Rock by Carmine Appice. It’s a perfect lesson book for beginning drummers that I highly recommend.\n\nCarmen is mostly associated with rock music, despite being heavily influenced by Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Appice has played with Vanilla Fudge, Cactus, the power trio Beck, Bogert & Appice, Rod Stewart, King Kobra, and more.\n\nPhil Collins\n\nPhil Collins is a drummer, singer, and songwriter from London, England. He is best known as the lead singer and drummer of the rock band Genesis.\n\nHe has also released several solo albums, including the Grammy-winning “No Jacket Required.” Collins has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and has received numerous awards throughout his career.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Collins is an avid philanthropist and has been involved in various charitable organizations. He is also an accomplished actor, having appeared in films such as “Buster” and “Hook.” Phil Collins is a multi-talented individual who has had a successful career in music and film.\n\nPhil Collins is arguably the most iconic drummer of all time next to Buddy Rich and Ringo Starr. Collins is responsible for writing and recording one of the most recognizable drum fills in history. His work in Genesis has gained him the rank of one of rock’s best drummers. He’s also noted as being one of the best singing drummers of all time.\n\nNeil Peart\n\nI would be lying if I said Neil Peart wasn’t one of my favorite drummers. While he can be considered a tad overrated, that doesn’t bug me. I learned so much from him when I was in high school, both relating to drums and life.\n\nNeil’s playing style is very technical and the music of Rush follows unique time signatures, riff-based instrumentation, and chord changes that are nontraditional to rock music.\n\nIn their early days, I would consider them progressive rock, but in the early 80s, their music morphed to new-wave and eventually became an amalgamation of hard rock, progressive rock, new wave, and hip hop (Roll The Bones, for example).\n\nJohn Bonham\n\nJohn Bonham is generally located in the #1 position on most “best drummer” lists, and for a great reason. Bonham is arguably the most influential drummer of the twentieth century. Comment down below if you disagree.\n\nJohn spawned a new breed of rock drummers, many of whom are included on this list. His playing was raucous, technical, and impressive. The solo in Moby Dick was a religious experience for me, to say the least. John may be the most influential drummer of the 1970s.\n\nTravis Barker\n\nTravis Barker seems to get a lot of shade thrown his way online, and I can’t help but wonder why. His playing is incredible! Anyone who cannot see it is blind. You must have a problem with the genre and style of music, not the player.\n\nTravis Barker is a drummer best known for his work with the rock band Blink-182. He first rose to prominence in the 90s with his signature frenetic drumming style, which helped to propel the band to mainstream success.\n\nBarker has also worked with a numerous artists, including rapper Travis Scott and pop singer Halsey.\n\nOutside of music, Barker is also an entrepreneur, with interests in fashion and clothing design. He has also been outspoken about his struggles with mental health, and has been an advocate for increased awareness of the issue. Travis Barker is a multi-talented musician who has had a profound impact on the world of rock music. He’s one of the best drummers of the 1990s and to this day.\n\nCindy Blackman\n\nCindy has quite a long resume as a working musician, which lead her to become one of the best American jazz and rock drummers today.\n\nShe is an incredible player; I can’t quite recall, but I think I remember seeing her at an Interstate Music clinic when I was very young.\n\nCindy has played with many incredible artists such as Pharoah Sanders, Sonny Simmons, Ron Carter, Sam Rivers, Cassandra Wilson, Angela Bofill, Buckethead, Bill Laswell, Lenny Kravitz, and others.\n\nCindy is married to rock guitarist Carlos Santana and she has stated that Tony Williams was a major influence on her as a drummer.\n\nSteve Gadd\n\nSteve Gadd is, without a doubt, the world’s most celebrated session drummer. Again, like with Purdie, I loved him as a kid and didn’t even know it. In my eyes, I was listening to Steely Dan’s drummer, without even realizing he was a studio musician and had played on tons of other albums.\n\nMy favorite, in particular, is an album by Chick Corea titled The Leprachaun. The song Lenore has some of the best linear drumming I have ever heard.\n\nElvin Jones\n\nElvin was the drumming machine behind John Coltrane’s quartet. From 1960 to 1966, Jones appeared on albums like A Love Supreme and Crescent.\n\nElvin Jones worked with plenty of notable jazz musicians over his career including Charles Mingus, Teddy Charles, Bud Powell, and Miles Davis.\n\nTony Williams\n\nTony Williams (b. December 12, 1945 – February 23, 1997) was an American jazz drummer most famous for his work with world-renowned trumpet player and bandleader Miles Davis.\n\nWilliams was a pioneer of jazz fusion.\n\nTony has appeared as a sideman with many bandleaders including Chet Baker, Geri Allen, Ron Carter, Stanley Clarke, Miles Davis, Gil Evans, Stan Getz, and many others.\n\nAl Jackson Jr.\n\nAl Jackson Jr. was a highly respected drummer who worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry. Born in 1935, Jackson began his career as a session musician in the early 1960s.\n\nHe went on to play on seminal albums by artists such as Otis Redding, Booker T. & The MGs, and Al Green. Jackson’s distinctive style – which combined R&B, soul, and pop elements – made him one of the most in-demand drummers of his generation. He continued to work regularly until his untimely death in 1975.\n\nToday, Jackson is remembered as one of the great innovators of modern drumming. His contributions to the world of music continue to inspire drummers of all genres.\n\nGene Krupa\n\nGene Krupa was one of the most influential drummers of the 20th century. A master of jazz and big band, he helped define the drummer’s role in modern music.\n\nKrupa was born in 1909 in Chicago, Illinois.

He died in 1973, but his legacy as a groundbreaking drummer still influences musicians today.\n\nClyde Stubblefield\n\nClyde Stubblefield was a drummer who helped shape the sound of Funk music. Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1943, Clyde began playing drums early. He quickly developed a unique style that incorporated elements of R&B and Jazz.\n\nIn 1965, Clyde joined the James Brown Band, and he went on to play on some of the most iconic Funk songs of all time, including “Cold Sweat” and “Funky Drummer.”\n\nClyde’s signature grooves had a profound influence on Hip Hop, and he has been sampled by hundreds of artists, including Public Enemy, NWA, and The Beastie Boys. Clyde continued to perform and record until he died in 2017.\n\nHe was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018. Clyde Stubblefield was a true pioneer of Funk music, and his impact is still felt today.\n\nHal Blaine\n\nHal Blaine is a drummer best known for his work on countless recordings by some of the biggest names in music. Blaine began his career as a session musician in the 1950s and quickly established himself as one of the most in-demand drummers in the business.\n\nOver the course of his career, Blaine played on an estimated 35,000 recordings, including hits by Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Simon & Garfunkel. In addition to his work as a studio musician, Blaine also toured with a number of bands, including The Beach Boys and The Carpenters.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 and was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.

January 10, 1924 – August 16, 2007) was an American jazz drummer credited to playing with musicians like Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and others.\n\nIn 1992, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame.\n\nMax’s The Drum Also Waltzes is one of my favorite drum solos of all time when looking back. He laid the foundation for drumming independence in a way I found challenging, yet rudimentary.\n\nKaren Carpenter\n\nKaren Carpenter was a hugely successful musician in the 1970s, best known as the lead singer of The Carpenters. She was also an accomplished drummer, and her drumming skills can be heard on many of the band’s biggest hits.\n\nDrums and singing should go hand in hand more often. Karen Carpenter had one of the greatest singing voices of all time. During the popularity of The Carpenters in the 70s, women weren’t known for being drummers. There was a certain stigma around it. Fortunately, this is not the case as much today.\n\nKaren tragically died at the age of 32 from complications related to anorexia nervosa, but her music continues to live on. To this day, Karen is remembered as one of the most talented and popular musicians of her generation. Her warm voice and catchy tunes are still cherished by fans all over the world.\n\nKaren left our world early, but her impact is still felt today. We also included her in our list of the best female drummers. Have a listen to “We’ve Only Just Begun,” and tell me it doesn’t bring a smile to your face.\n\nRoy Haynes\n\nRoy Haynes is one of the most celebrated drummers in jazz history.
