        "text": "Whitesnake’s 1997 album Restless Heart will get its first-ever U.S. release as part of a new reissue.\n\nRestless Heart will be available on Oct. 29 in various formats, including a four-CD super deluxe edition that includes remixed and remastered versions of the original album along with demos, instrumental tracks and studio outtakes. The super deluxe edition also comes with a DVD that includes music videos, behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the album and new interviews with frontman David Coverdale. A hardbound book of photos from the era will round out the set.\n\nFans who don’t want to shell out for the super deluxe edition of Restless Heart can also take their pick of a two-CD deluxe edition (featuring the original album plus a 2021 remix), a two-LP version of the new remix pressed on 180-gram silver vinyl or a single-CD edition of the new remix. Restless Heart will also be available on digital retailers and streaming services.\n\nWhitesnake are previewing the Restless Heart reissue with a new music video for up-tempo rocker “You’re So Fine,” which you can watch below.\n\nRestless Heart marked Whitesnake’s first studio album of new material since 1989’s Slip of the Tongue. Coverdale initially intended to release it as a solo album, but EMI pressured him to release it under the “David Coverdale & Whitesnake” moniker. Although it was never released in the U.S., it performed respectably in the U.K., peaking at No. 34 on the U.K. Albums Chart.\n\nWhitesnake will have the opportunity to play some Restless Heart songs live next year when they tour the U.K. and Ireland with Foreigner and Europe. The rockers — who just added singer, multi-instrumentalist and Trans-Siberian Orchestra alum Dino Jelusick to their ranks — will kick off the tour in Dublin on May 10, 2022.\n\nYou can see the Restless Heart super deluxe edition track listing below.\n\nWhitesnake, 'Restless Heart' Super Deluxe Edition Track Listing\n\nDisc 1:\n\nRESTLESS HEART: 2021 REMIX\n\n1. “Restless Heart”\n\n2. “You’re So Fine”\n\n3. “Can’t Go On”\n\n4. “Crying”\n\n5. “Take Me Back Again”\n\n6. “Anything You Want”\n\n7. “Too Many Tears”\n\n8. “All In The Name Of Love”\n\n9. “Your Precious Love”\n\n10. “Can’t Stop Now”\n\n11. “Woman Trouble Blues”\n\n12. “Stay With Me”\n\n13. “Oi (Theme For An Imaginary Drum Solo)”\n\n14. “Don’t Fade Away”\n\n15. “Can’t Go On (Unzipped)”\n\nDISC 2:\n\nRESTLESS HEART: 2021 REMASTER\n\n1. “Don’t Fade Away”\n\n2. “All In The Name Of Love”\n\n3. “Restless Heart”\n\n4. “Too Many Tears”\n\n5. “Crying”\n\n6. “Stay With Me”\n\n7. “Can’t Go On”\n\n8. “You’re So Fine”\n\n9. “Your Precious Love”\n\n10. “Take Me Back Again”\n\n11. “Woman Trouble Blues”\n\n12. “Anything You Want”\n\n13. “Can’t Stop Now”\n\n14. “Too Many Tears ’95 (Live & Drunk in the Studio featuring The Horny B’stards)”\n\nDISC 3:\n\nDANCING ON THE TITANIC\n\nEarly Arrangements & Getting Drum Tracks in the Studio\n\n1. “Restless Heart “\n\n2. “You’re So Fine”\n\n3. “Can’t Go On”\n\n4. “Crying”\n\n5. “Take Me Back Again”\n\n6. “Anything You Want”\n\n7. “Too Many Tears”\n\n8. “All In The Name Of Love”\n\n9. “Your Precious Love (Soul Version)”\n\n10. “You Precious Love”\n\n11. “Can’t Stop Now (Instrumental Version)”\n\n12. “Woman Trouble Blues”\n\n13. “Stay With Me”\n\n14. “Oi (Instrumental)”\n\n15. “Don’t Fade Away”\n\n16. “Snakes Down South (Unreleased Demo)”\n\nDISC 4:\n\nRESTLESS HEART: EVOLUTIONS\n\n1. “Restless Heart”\n\n2. “You’re So Fine”\n\n3. “Can’t Go On”\n\n4. “Crying”\n\n5. “Take Me Back Again”\n\n6. “Anything You Want (Red Light Green Light)”\n\n7. “Too Many Tears”\n\n8. “All In The Name Of Love”\n\n9. “Your Precious Love”\n\n10. “Can’t Stop Now”\n\n11. “Woman Trouble Blues”\n\n12. “Stay With Me”\n\n13. “Oi (Instrumental)”\n\n14. “Don’t Fade Away”\n\nDISC 5: RESTLESS HEART: DVD-VIDEO\n\n“All In The Name Of Love” | Fan Video\n\n“Anything You Want” | Fan Video\n\n“You’re So Fine” | Music Video\n\n“Restless Heart” | Fan Video\n\n“Too Many Tears” | Music Video\n\n“Don’t Fade Away” | Music Video\n\n“Can’t Go On” | Acoustic Slideshow\n\n“Restless Heart” | Lyric Video\n\nSTARKERS TRILOGY\n\n“Too Many Tears”\n\n“Can’t Go On”\n\n“Don’t Fade Away”\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nThe Making Of Restless Heart"
