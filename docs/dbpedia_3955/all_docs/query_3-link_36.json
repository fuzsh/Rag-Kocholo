        "text": "Hometown: San Jose, CA\n\nInterests in vet med: Small animal surgery\n\nInvolvements: I am involved with several research projects, most of which have a surgical oncology focus. I am the president of our Surgery Club and Pride SVMC chapter. I am also my year's DEI representative.\n\nHobbies: Spending time with friends, watching TV shows, nature walks\n\nFun fact: I was born in Jordan, grew up in Qatar, and moved to California as a sophomore in high school.\n\nHometown: Cummington, MA/Big Horn, WY\n\nInterests in vet med: Equine performance, surgery, cardiology\n\nInvolvements: SCAEEP, SAVS, D.V.M. curriculum committee, Class of 2025 vice president\n\nHobbies: Horses, hiking, dogs, camping, trail running\n\nAdvice to students: It is okay to not have the perfect GPA in undergrad. There are so many ways to make yourself stand out as an applicant, don’t let the fear of not having the best GPA keep you from pursuing applying.\n\nAsk me about balancing a life outside of academics.\n\nHometown: Bozeman, MT\n\nInterests in vet med: Wildlife vet med or small animal GP\n\nInvolvements: I work with Drs. Bosco-Lauth and Bowen in their infectious disease lab. I also work at a student ambassador for Lakefield Veterinary Group. I am a member of the Pathology Club, Behavior Club, and Internal Medicine Club among others.\n\nHobbies: Reading, cooking, hiking, walking my dog\n\nMy favorite thing about CSU's D.V.M. Program is the amount of opportunities the school offers to learn new things, from clubs and volunteering to part-time positions at the VTH and trips abroad.\n\nAsk me about becoming a WICHE student or attending school as an older student.\n\nHometown: Virginia Beach\n\nInterests in vet med: Public health, One Health, international work, internal medicine\n\nInvolvements: Class of 2026 Executive Board, One Health Club, Internal Medicine Club, Wildlife Disease Association, student hourly job in Small Animal Internal Medicine at the VTH, public health research external to CSU\n\nHobbies: Snowboarding, paddleboarding, skateboarding, hiking and camping, traveling\n\nOne piece of advice to pre-vet students is to diversify yourself. Immerse yourself in clubs and/or your favorite hobby(ies). It is no secret that you need good grades to get into vet school. However, I have found job and vet school interviewers to be much more interested in my extracurricular experiences instead of whether I got straight As or not. CSU has a knack for admitting students who are well-rounded. It is truly not about veterinary medicine being your identity, but rather fitting the career of a veterinarian into your greater identity as someone with outside interests and relationships. Ask me about how human and animal health are connected!\n\nHometown: Falcon, CO\n\nInterests in vet med: Small animal general practice and emergency medicine\n\nInvolvements: Surgery club, small ruminant club, emergency and critical care club, Christian Veterinary Fellowship, volunteering with Street Dog Coalition, working as a technician at an emergency and specialty hospital, Spanish for Veterinary Professionals certificate\n\nHobbies: Hiking, traveling, drinking coffee, fostering cats\n\nMy favorite thing about CSU is the community here! I feel very supported by my peers and faculty. I also love getting to live in beautiful Fort Collins and have access to the outdoors and a vibrant downtown area.\n\nFun fact: I spent a gap year before vet school traveling in Peru and Europe, and I hope to be able to practice internationally as a veterinarian.\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nInterests in vet med: Oncology, surgery, general practice in small animal\n\nInvolvements: President-elect of SAVMA, treasurer of VBMA, research in Dr. Regan's osteosarcoma lab\n\nHobbies: Watching cooking/baking shows, cooking, and arts and crafts!\n\nA fun fact about me is that I was born with moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, and just recently upgraded to a cochlear implant on my right side! I've worn hearing aids my whole life so this has been a big change.\n\nHometown: Simsbury, CT\n\nInterests in vet med: Sport medicine and orthopedics, internal medicine\n\nInvolvements: Member of sports medicine and rehabilitation club, member of surgery club, veterinary technician in urgent care department at CSU veterinary teaching hospital, 1:1 tutor for first-year D.V.M. students\n\nHobbies: Skiing, horseback riding (less frequent now), and hiking/exploring with my dog\n\nMy advice for pre-vet students is to explore vet med areas that are truly of interest to you (not checkboxes). Finding fun experiences with great people not only helps you form lifelong connections but also are good reminders for why you chose this path during tough weeks of vet school.\n\nAsk me about working during vet school or school-life balance in the fun town of Fort Collins!\n\nHometown: Scottsdale, AZ\n\nInterests in vet med: Small animal GP and animal behavior\n\nInvolvements: President of the CSU Animal Behavior Club, assistant student coordinator for the D.V.M. ambassador program, VTH tour guide, and member of VBMA\n\nHobbies: Baking/cooking, reading, and playing with my dog Flynn\n\nMy advice to incoming students is to find a routine that works for you. I found having a set rhythm each day allowed me to enjoy a better work-life balance which greatly reduced my stress.\n\nAsk me about what the first year is like or animal behavior (though fair warning, once I get talking about it I can go on and on about behavior)!\n\nHometown: Edinburg, TX\n\nInterests in vet med: Emergency and shelter medicine\n\nInvolvements: Class treasurer, Shelter Medicine Club, Dentistry Club, Emergency and Critical Care Society, VetText Marketing Manager\n\nHobbies outside of school: Traveling, hiking, snowshoeing, adventuring with my husband and our three dogs\n\nMy favorite thing about CSU's D.V.M. Program is the many opportunities available to students to engage in different concentrations that they may be interested in. Our professors and faculty are extremely engaged in our learning and it's exciting to learn from and work alongside each of them as they are each passionate in a very diverse array of topics which makes it easy to find things you may also like to explore while in school.\n\nAsk me about: Applications and the application process, clinical experience, being a non-traditional, older, transfer, or married student, or any other questions you may have!\n\nHometown: Albuquerque, NM\n\nInterests in vet med: Mixed animal, rural practice, shelter med\n\nInvolvements: SCAAEP, AASRP, AABP, Pride, VOICE\n\nHobbies outside of school: Hiking, baking, running, skiing, longboarding + more depending on the day!\n\nA fun fact about me is that I cut my own hair, and I have a million hobbies. Ask me about WICHE, adjusting to cold weather, adapting to vet school, or anything else you can think of!\n\nHometown: Baton Rouge, LA\n\nInterests in vet med: Equine general practice\n\nInvolvements: Student chapter of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (SAAEP) and Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation (VSMR)\n\nHobbies: Running, skiing, rock climbing, horseback riding\n\nA fun fact about me is that I am an artist!

Program is the amount of clubs and opportunities that you are given to explore all the niches in veterinary medicine! Ask me about vet school applications or the process of transitioning to vet school.\n\nHometown: Anchorage, AK\n\nInterests in vet med: Zoo medicine, conservation medicine, and sled dog medicine\n\nInvolvements: UAF VBMA, Vet Med Club, and Hub Outpost Program (HOP)\n\nHobbies outside of school: Roller derby, running, and ice skating\n\nMy favorite thing about the UAF/CSU D.V.M. Program is the small class size, it has caused my class to become a community that supports each other. The faculty are also great about making time to help the students and genuinely want us to succeed.\n\nAdvice to students: Try not to compare yourself to other students, everyone has their strengths and is doing great at something. Focus on the positive as much as you can and remind yourself that you are working hard and doing great.\n\nHometown: Colorado Springs, CO\n\nInterests in vet med: Zoo and wildlife medicine\n\nInvolvements: Wildlife Disease Association, AAWV, Zoo Med Society, WAVMA, One Health, Pathology Club\n\nHobbies outside of school: Looking for cool wildlife (especially bears), camping, painting, and watching sports\n\nMy advice for pre-vet students is to follow your passions. Find what you are interested in and what makes you happy, both within vet med and outside. It seem like an uphill battle sometimes but if you find what brings you joy along the journey you can achieve amazing things!\n\nInterests in vet med: Small animal internal medicine and clinical research\n\nInvolvements: Honor Board representative, first-year representative for Internal Medicine Club, member of AASRP, LARC, and Behavior Club\n\nHobbies: Hiking, skiing, snorkeling, dog agility, reading, and photography\n\nMy advice to pre-vet students is to get in the habit of making time for your hobbies/the things that bring you joy because they will be especially important for your mental wellbeing once the workload increases.\n\nFun fact: My favorite animals are seals because they introduced me to vet med!\n\nHometown: Johnstown, PA\n\nInterest in vet med: Mixed animal, emergency, surgery\n\nInvolvements: AABP, AASRP, AAFP, University Chorus\n\nHobbies outside of school: Singing, dancing, reading, baking, and watching rom-coms!\n\nMy advice is don’t fall into the trap that a lot of pre-vet students do where they kill themselves to get fantastic grades and ignore the things that make them happy. Mental health is one of the most important aspects of veterinary school- start taking care of it in undergrad! Do things outside of science classes! Make time to read, watch TV, dance, whatever makes you happy. My GPA was not the highest of some of my classmates, but I was in choir, band, dance team, and theatre all throughout undergrad, and I think my passion for things outside of vet med helped me succeed and lead me to veterinary school at CSU!\n\nFun fact: I can pull out choreography to any ABBA song at any moment."
