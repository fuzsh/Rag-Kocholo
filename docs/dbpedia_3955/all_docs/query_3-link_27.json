        "text": "Hunters have long known that Nebraska is an upland bird hunter’s paradise — the mixed bag capital of the Great Plains — with diverse upland hunting opportunities, long seasons, great access to public lands, and high hunter satisfaction rates. This year, take advantage of Nebraska’s unique upland hunting opportunities by participating in the Upland Slam.\n\nThe concept of the Nebraska Upland Slam is simple: harvest four birds — a sharp-tailed grouse, greater prairie-chicken, ring-necked pheasant and northern bobwhite quail – in Nebraska and receive an official certificate, Nebraska Upland Slam pin and epic bragging rights. Additionally, all hunters who complete the slam during the 2024-2025 season will be registered to win a grand prize generously donated by Pheasants Forever/Quail Forever.\n\nHow it works\n\nFirst, buy your ticket to hunt all four species — your Nebraska hunt permit. After you harvest your first bird, create an account on our official entry form (which will be located here beginning Sept. 1) and submit a photo and details about your first bird. As you continue with other species, you can log back in to document your success.\n\nOnce you complete your slam for the 2024-2025 hunting season, you will receive an official pin and certificate.\n\nTop Dog Certificate\n\nWe want to recognize your dogs, too! Once you’ve completed the slam, upload a photo of your hunting dog at work in the field to your slam entry submission form and receive an official “Top Dog” tag and certificate while supplies last.\n\nPrizes\n\nEach hunter who completes the slam will receive an official certificate, a pin and be entered into a drawing to win a grand prize. The drawing will take place after the close of upland hunting seasons.\n\nSeason dates\n\nSharp-tailed grouse: Sept. 1, 2024 – Jan. 31, 2025\n\nGreater prairie-chicken: Sept. 1, 2024 – Jan. 31, 2025\n\nRing-necked pheasant: Oct. 26, 2024 – Jan. 31, 2025\n\nNorthern bobwhite quail: Oct. 26, 2024 – Jan. 31, 2025\n\nSuccessful finishers\n\nThe Nebraska Game and Parks Commission congratulates the hunters who have completed the Upland Slam. Find a complete list of those hunters below."
