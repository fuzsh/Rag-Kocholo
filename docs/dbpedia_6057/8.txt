Studiocanal UK has shared a trailer for a charming new romantic comedy, titled What's Love Got to Do with It? The movie centers on a filmmaker, played by Lily James, who is making a documentary about her longtime friend and neighbor, played by Shazad Latif, as he goes through the process of being set up with an arranged marriage. It looks like it could actually be a delightful romcom.

The movie also stars Emma Thompson, Shabana Azmi, Sajal Aly, Asim Chaudhry, Jeff Mirza, Mim Shaikh, and more. Here’s the synopsis:

How do you find lasting love in today's world? For documentary-maker and dating app addict Zoe (Lily James), swiping right has only delivered an endless stream of Mr Wrongs, to her eccentric mother Cath's (Emma Thompson) dismay. For Zoe's childhood friend and neighbour Kaz (Shazad Latif), the answer is to follow his parents’ example and opt for an arranged (or "assisted") marriage to a bright and beautiful bride from Pakistan. As Zoe films his hopeful journey from London to Lahore to marry a stranger, chosen by his parents, she begins to wonder if she might have something to learn from this profoundly different approach to finding true love.
