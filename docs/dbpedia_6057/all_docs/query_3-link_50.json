        "text": "Phil Collins (born January 30, 1951, London, England) is an English drummer, singer, songwriter, and record producer who rose to fame in the music world in the 1970s and ’80s both for his work with the rock band Genesis and for his pop solo career. He was the winner of multiple Grammy Awards in the 1980s and ’90s.\n\nCollins was gifted a drum set at the age of five and improved his skill through practicing along with music on both the radio and television. He also pursued acting and singing, most notably performing in a 1964 stage production of Oliver! Collins also had bit parts in several movies, including the comedy musical A Hard Day’s Night (1964), starring the Beatles.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nWhile Collins was acting, his passion for music grew as well. He played with bands such as the Cliff Charles Blues Band, the Charge, the Freehold, Zox, and the Radar Boys. In 1969 he was a drummer and singer for the band Flaming Youth. Though its work was relatively successful, the band split up soon after releasing its first album, Ark 2 (1969).\n\nCollins’s big break came in 1970 when he won a position as a drummer for the progressive rock band Genesis, whose lead singer was Peter Gabriel. When Gabriel left to pursue a solo career after the release of the group’s album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974), Collins took over lead vocals. Under his direction, the band slowly developed a more mainstream sound marked by a host of hit singles and the successful albums Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Invisible Touch (1986). In the mid- and late 1970s Collins simultaneously played and recorded with the jazz fusion band Brand X.\n\nAlthough Collins stayed with Genesis until 1996, he also began a solo career in 1981. Whereas Genesis produced “intellectual” album-oriented rock, Collins as a solo performer featured pop songs that appealed to more general audiences. In 1981 Collins released his debut solo album Face Value, featuring “In the Air Tonight” as its lead single. The song became an international hit, reaching number two on the U.K. charts.\n\nSingles such as the power ballad “Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)” (1984), the dance song “Sussudio” (1985), and the slow ballad “A Groovy Kind of Love” (1988) all became number one hits in the United States. In 1999 Collins won an Academy Award for best original song for “You’ll Be in My Heart,” which was released for the Walt Disney animated movie Tarzan.\n\nIn the 1980s Collins began to act again. He appeared on the television series Miami Vice in 1985 and starred in the comedy-adventure movie Buster (1988), the latter of which included his hit singles “A Groovy Kind of Love” and “Two Hearts.” Other acting projects include small appearances in Steven Spielberg’s Hook (1991) and in the TV movie And the Band Played On (1993), as well as voice parts in the animated movies Balto (1995) and The Jungle Book 2 (2003).\n\nCollins released only a few studio albums in the 21st century. Testify (2002) was his last recording to include original songs. In 2007 Collins joined Genesis for a reunion tour, but it did not lead to any new material. The album Going Back (2010) contained Collins’s renditions of Motown classics.\n\nThroughout his career, Collins received several Grammy Awards, including album of the year for No Jacket Required (1985), record of the year for “Another Day in Paradise” (1989), and best soundtrack album for Tarzan (1999). Among his other honours, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. In 2014 three of his solo songs appeared on the Genesis compilation R-Kive."
