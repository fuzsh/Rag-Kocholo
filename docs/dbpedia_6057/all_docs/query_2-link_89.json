        "text": "Estes Park has a beauty and strength you don’t see when entering the community on Highway 34 or 36. It is only visible in the spirit and strength of the residents that made me develop such a love and passion for this community that will stay with me for the rest of my days. I saw this early in my tenure here in Estes Park. After the flood, I observed the community band together and watched Cody Walker, Todd Jirsa, and many volunteers travel by horseback to give meals to those stranded. I watched residents help clean up streets and businesses that had been flooded, and I observed John Cullen opening up The Stanley during the fires to host and feed the firefighters during the Cameron Peak fire. I watched as Antonio from Antonio’s Pizza brought food in for them while at the same time offering free bread to anyone in need during the pandemic. I have watched Rob Pieper from Poppy’s host dinners for charities that promote mentoring for our youth; I could go on and on with examples of the generosity of this great community.\n\nEstes is mountain strong and beautiful in its way of resolving issues, although some took years, (The Loop) the community always has found a way to get along and move along. I will sorely miss this spirit, which, at times, I found frustrating as well.\n\nI would first like to thank the Town of Estes Park for allowing me to serve as the Publisher of the local paper of record for the past 13 years. Serving in this role has been a dream of mine since my early days in this industry. Although I was able to serve in similar capacities during my career, none came with the character, intelligence, and opportunity we have had in Estes Park. I hope that my commitment and efforts made Estes a better place. Thank You, Estes Park!\n\nDuring this time, we have reported on many things, including floods, fires, big snowstorms, etc. Through it all, I can sincerely say that I am very proud of our accomplishments and work in supporting so many efforts, including the Lot 4 sale, the start-up and development of the local EDC, the 1% sales tax, the 6E ballot initiative, the Mountain Coaster, all of the upgrades and projects at The Stanley, the many positive changes with EPH, the Rec Center, the School district and many others including the loop project which is in full bloom right now, for better or worse. I am also proud of our watchdog news coverage on the taxing districts, including the Rec District, the School District, the Town government and VEP, including the turmoil that preceded Kara Franker. In addition, we provided continuing coverage in print and online during the flood, pandemic, and fires, including the recent Alexander Mountain Fire, for which we were among the first to publish the news of the fire among all our peers along the front range. Many of us worked night and day during these times to ensure the public was aware of all the breaking news associated with them all.\n\nI am also proud of our continued commitment to the philanthropic contributions we have made over these 13 years. On our dime, we have printed an average of six pages a week of community-focused articles from the many non-profits in our community. I hope that this has made Estes Park a better place.\n\nI also know I have upset and challenged many during my tenure with our editorials/opinions. Please understand that these were never written out of spite or anger and were always intended to instigate discussion in hopes of our community coming together with the best possible solution. To those I upset or angered, my apologies.\n\nAs I have noted in this space over the years, I began developing a love for this industry in the late 1960s, when, as a young boy, I sold newspapers on the steps of the capital in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was amazed at the news’s interest and impact on legislators and citizens who wanted the newspaper. I often sold all my papers within an hour if I made it to my sales position early enough.\n\nAfter 48 years in this industry and working in every department in a newspaper, I have decided that it is time for me to retire. My last day will be August 30, 2024. The industry has changed, and I am saddened by the lack of interest in the fact-based truth we provide in favor of social media or blog posts that cater to what people want to read to support their stand or beliefs. The cries of fake news that politicians cry every time they get caught in lies have diluted what we do. These issues have hurt the industry, and most mainstream media companies continue to lose ad revenues that support the writers and journalists who discover and write about the news, thus losing reporters, etc. This has happened here in Estes as well. I am fearful that the fourth estate established by our founding fathers is in its last days, and what we are left with after will be very similar to that of third-world countries where honest journalists are jailed for writing and exposing government misuse of power and resources.\n\nI have made many good friends in this community and will sorely miss this great community and all it offers. I want to thank John Cullen, who is a good, caring man who works diligently to make Estes Park a better place both with his business and the many philanthropic works he does that go entirely under the radar by his request. Thank you to Kara Franker, Heidi Barfels, and Sherene Khan Irani at VEP for being great partners in promoting Estes Park, including the local businesses and the beauty we provide. Thank you to those at EPH, including Vern Carda, Kevin Mullin, and especially Wendy Rigby. I also would be remiss for not thanking Travis Machalek for his patience, as I know I have challenged him as well, but in every instance, he handled it gracefully. Thank you also to our new Mayor, Gary Hall, who is well on his way to making a big difference in our community as his commitment and intent is a pure as it seems, no games here, he ran to serve. I also would like to thank all the Trustees for their service and patience with me as I have pushed you all for open communication and transparency. I also applaud you for serving our community!\n\nI would like to personally thank my many editorial board members who have helped me navigate these opinions through the years: Greg Rosener, Jim Pickering, Jon Nicholas, Tom Carosello, Charley Dickey, Todd Jirsa, Cody Walker, Bettie Tully, Rich Flanery, Howard Hanson, Liz Zornes, TeresaMaria Widawski, and others who advised me during the years.\n\nI would also like to thank the many reporters and editors who worked here over this period of time. David Persons, John Cordsen, Wal Hester, Zach Clemens, Tyler Pialet, Dan West, Wendy Rigby, Jason Van Tatenhove, Matt Poust, William Oster, Dawn Wilson, Patti Brown, Nic Wackerly, and those who handled sales responsibilities, including Daniel Sewell, Susan Giglio, and Mike O’Flaherty. I am also thankful to Deb Thelander and Julie Webb for their dedication to delivering our newspapers to the many locations throughout Estes Park to ensure the news is available to everyone, whether one can afford to buy a paper or not. The news should be free and available to all of us.\n\nIt is a very bittersweet moment for me after developing such a passion and love for Estes Park that, for now, I am saying goodbye to a part of me that will never leave. Estes Park, thank you for the memories, challenges, heated debates, and the true mountain-strong attitude I have seen and felt all these years. I will miss you, and I hope my dedication and work have helped this amazing community.\n\nWith a heartfelt goodbye, thank you!"
