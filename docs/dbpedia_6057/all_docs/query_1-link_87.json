        "text": "In Deathly Hallows, when Harry approached the Pensieve, he was grief-stricken and broken by battle. He practically fell into Snape’s memories, and discovered a little thin-faced boy who once knew a girl called Lily. Harry’s mother and Snape were childhood friends. Growing up in their tiny Muggle town of Cokeworth, they bonded over their magical powers like other kids do over toys.\n\nOnce at Hogwarts the two friends were sorted into different houses, and later Snape fell in with the wrong crowd. Not just the usual teenage reprobates, but future supporters of the most powerful Dark wizard of all time.\n\nThe chapter that made us fall in love with… Severus Snape - Pottermore\n\nI don't think he ever did tell her, I don't see that in the books. Snape probably was like most teenaged boys-he couldn't bring himself to tell her how much he loved her either because he was shy, or thought he was unworthy of someone like Lily and was afraid of rejection.\n\nI think Lily may have cared for him immensely, but there is no evidence that her feelings were as intense as his apparently were, or that those feelings translated to any kind of physical attraction or romance. Snape was an oddball as a young man, and while Lily cared a lot about him it may have been only as very good friends. Whatever chance Snape may have had with Lily died off when he started dabbling in the dark side of wizardry.\n\nLily couldn't deal with his slide toward the dark side, that slide changed the young man she thought she knew, and scared her. She was concerned about him, but at the same time, she knew that as long as he persisted in dabbling in the dark magic and hanging around those that did, she couldn't be with him. But she still cared about Snape, she would rebuke James when he and his friends would tease him.\n\nPersonally, I think she cared about him immensely till the day she died. They were close friends, she saw in him someone special that she could care about. But she couldn't be with him.\n\nDid Snape ever tell Lily that he loved her? Did she ever figure it out? - Quora"
