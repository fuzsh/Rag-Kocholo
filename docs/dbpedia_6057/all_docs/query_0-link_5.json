While rom-coms may pull on one’s heartstrings and cause audiences to cry their eyes out, they can also provide iconic comedic moments, making the viewer laugh out loud minutes later.\n\nThough there have been some memorable films released in the 21st century, including The Proposal, Crazy Rich Asians, Love and Basketball and Crazy, Stupid, Love., romantic comedies were notably all the rage in the late ’80s and ’90s, with stars like Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts dominating the movie genre. Many of their films, including When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman and Sleepless in Seattle, have since become rom-com staples, and are still adored today.\n\nHowever, the film genre saw a decrease in box office revenue during the mid to late 2010s, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Statista. But, since 2022, rom-coms have started making a comeback with the help of streaming giants such as Netflix and Prime Video.\n\nNow, there’s no denying that there are hundreds of beloved romantic comedies that deliver all the best feelings, and while this list doesn’t come close to including them all, The Hollywood Reporter has compiled some must-watch rom-coms, perfect for any day of the year, but especially Valentine’s Day, below."
