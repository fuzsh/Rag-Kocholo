        "text": "Dreamland\n\n9pm, Sky Atlantic\n\nBased on Sharon Horgan’s 2018 Bafta-winning short of the same name, expectations are high for this Margate-set comedy-drama – but don’t let this, or the bright bubblegum aesthetic, get you too excited. Lily Allen is black sheep Mel, who turns up at the party of her pregnant sister Trish (Freema Agyeman) uninvited. With their two other sisters, mum and gran also in tow, it’s clear that secrets are about to unravel. Hollie Richardson\n\nThe Dog Academy\n\n8pm, Channel 4\n\nThis week’s roll call of “Britain’s worst-behaved dogs” includes a destructive dalmatian who has caused £18,000 of damage in a year and a jack russell cross who is like “something from a horror film”. Their rehabilitation is as much an attempt to offer therapy to the owners as tackle canine training. Alexi Duggins\n\nGet on Up: The Triumph of Black America\n\n9pm, BBC Two\n\nSpanning the 80s through to the present day, the second part of David Harewood’s look at Black US pop culture charts the emergence of hip-hop, the career of film-maker Spike Lee, the politics of Beyoncé’s music and the Black Panther films, and the impact that The Wire had for Black actors – leading to a “Black cultural renaissance”. Micha Frazer-Carroll\n\nTaskmaster\n\n9pm, Channel 4\n\nThe benign but palpable frisson between Ivo Graham and his neighbour on stage, Frankie Boyle, comes to the fore this week as the pair collaborate to raise a potato higher than the other three players. Plus, there’s some surprisingly convincing miming to music, and Kiell Smith-Bynoe invents a disturbing glove. Jack Seale\n\nMeet the Richardsons\n\n10pm, Dave\n\nJon is turning 40 this year and has “coincidentally thought about getting a tattoo and a motorbike”. Elsewhere in the faux-reality show (which nevertheless feels horribly convincing), there’s a trip to the National Comedy awards, where an imperious Katherine Ryan throws shade at Lucy. Ali Catterall\n\nLove, Faith and Me: Our Supersized Christian Family\n\n10.40pm, BBC One\n\nThe chance of having identical triplets is 200 million to one. But the fact that Amy and husband, Alex, have children at all (five boys under the age of five) is a prayed-for “miracle” in itself. In this affecting study, they discuss how their Christian faith helps them navigate a chaotic family life. AC\n\nLive sport\n\nGolf: The Masters 2pm, Sky Sports Main Event. The major, won last year by Scottie Scheffler, returns to the Augusta National."
