        "text": "Ian Cooper, producer (“Nope”)\n\nWhen considering the impossible task of curating my favorite films of the 1980’s (aka my childhood) it seems insane to even have to consider Reitman’s unparalleled masterpiece in corner-cutting slacker entrepreneurialism vs municipal-malaise (GHOSTBUSTERS, 1984) OR Kubrick’s forever terrifying, master-class adjustment on Steven King’s embossed cover, zillion page snow-pulp, THE SHINING, 1980. Let’s just assume that there is nothing better achievable by mortals than those two artworks, and not even bother to include them. It would almost be insulting. Ok, with that out of the way, and in no particular order, here goes:\n\nRUNNING ON EMPTY (1988) — Don’t get me wrong, many movies of this era galvanized my pre-goth fixation with melancholy, but when I watched this one for the first time on VHS in the summer of 1989 (while on a family trip to South Carolina with my then BFF, Jesse Swinger, in between endless arcade rounds of Altered Beast) my emotional floor was stirred. The hippie idealism gone sideways plot hit me like when the theme song to M*A*S*H comes on TV and you still have so much homework to do. River’s hair. Martha Plimpton’s masterful performance (as always). The leaving of a family dog on the side of the road. River’s hair. I sob just recollecting.\n\nMANHUNTER (1986) — Drippy, glammy, danger. Michael Mann can do no wrong, but when you add Tom Noonan as a new-wave serial killer, I perish. Here’s a hot tip that Jordan and I discovered — if you play the vinyl soundtrack (by Waxwork Records) at the incorrect RPM, the Red 7 song, Heartbeat is no joke 10x better. And in related news: Wow, the contemporary Los Angeles band, Fashion Club — If you haven’t stopped listening to “Goodbye Horses” since the foot massage scene in MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), then this band is poised to save your soul. Pascal Stevenson’s entrancing baritone woven through her atmospheric art-rock-pop soundscape is perfection incarnate. Demme would have been in the pit with me shoegazing at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery if he was still with us, I can tell you that much.\n\nONE CRAZY SUMMER (1986) — This one hits close to home in regards to the daunting task of applying to art school. Savage Steve Holland’s angsty, Zap Comix inspired animated sequences; Curtis Armstrong + Bobcat Goldthwait’s abject dynamism, but the coup-de-grace doubles as one of my favorite “ready-made” sculptures: a plush Odie mounted to the mast of “The Boat” who’s Gene Simmons length tongue becomes castrated. This film’s inclusion was neck-and-neck with HOWARD THE DUCK (same year), which I boasted (until BLACK PANTHER, 2018) had been the only Marvel movie I had seen.\n\nALICE (1988) — My mother took me to see Jan Svankmajer’s macabre adaptation of Lewis Carrol’s edgy fever-dream at Film Forum and it became an instantaneous touchstone for me in the avant garde convergence of coming-of-age trauma and horror. You guys, it’s soooo abject. The White Rabbit eagerly consumes its own sawdust guts. As far as I’m concerned, this is the most cannon-accurate tone of any previous or subsequent adaptations of Carrol’s material.\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984) — Quite possibly a perfect cocktail: instantly discernable, relatable hook (unsurpassed with the possible exception of IT FOLLOWS, 2014) coupled with an iconic (beyond belief!) villain with the highest risk wardrobe decision that impossibly stuck the eternal landing. Pop-Horror perfection with no punches pulled. Tina’s indelible bedroom ceiling murder always hit me as the most terrifying balance of grounded and supernatural, and I can barely conjure a more striking frame in 80’s cinema than when she appears to Nancy during an afternoon desk-doze upright and replete in her shower-curtain-body-bag.\n\nBLOW OUT (1981) — Working with Johnnie Burn on his epic and precise soundscape for NOPE (2022) had me recollecting on my introduction (and subsequent obsession) with movie sound design vis-a-vis De Palma’s folley-forward masterpiece. I watched this film on VHS in early high school and the boots-on-the-ground-artistry depiction of Travolta’s character concretized the marriage of pragmatism and creativity that is the bedrock of the BTS of filmmaking.\n\nTHE WAY THINGS GO (1987) — A staple of art school sculpture class screenings, Peter Fischli and David Weiss’ 30 minute Rube Goldbergian kinetic daisy-chain codified the ubiquitous zeitgeist that dominated the 80’s, (THE GOONIES, PEEWEE’S BIG ADVENTURE, BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE MONEY PIT etc) — the beauty of this artwork is that unlike opening gates or preparing breakfast, here form and function are handcuffed to each other and the bedpost! ;-) The process here is the pleasure principle. Ideally, this film would loop forever like an eternal Truffle-Shuffle flame.\n\nHEATHERS (1988) — I mentioned River Phoenix’s hair earlier, to set myself up for mentioning Christian Slater’s hair here. In fact, forget the castrato Odie, my dream would be to commission a land-art diptych where Phoenix’s hair in Running On Empty is sculpted large-scale using only earth-moving equipment, and you could stand on it to gaze into the distance at a parallel sculpture of Christian Slater’s hair from KUFFS (1992). But I digress…HEATHERS taught me the ways of Dark Comedy as a subgenre as well as the finessed lines between camp and grounded hyperbole. The moral is also critical and should be underscored, no matter how hot and steamy the sociopath adolescent hunk is, he ain’t ultimately worth the juice for the squeeze.\n\nDIVA (1981) — if you’ve seen any of the sculptures I’ve made, the films I’ve produced, or read any of the nonsense I’ve scribed above, you can probably tell that my perennial appetite is for pop-darkness. My parents showed me this film in highschool, and between the synth score, Jean-Jacques Beineix’s post-punk aesthetics and undeniable pleasure-mining of “thriller” genre tropes, I was all, “J’Adore.”\n\nSTAND BY ME (1986) — And I’ll bookend with more melancholy as well as one of the most important ingredients of this decade: Corey Feldman. I saw this film in a long-ago shuttered theater in the West Village with my close friend, Anna Schneider Mayerson. This meditative death-drive meets puberty-betrayal quest always hits me like lethal potpourri: sophomoric hijinx plus meta-lost-friendships-to-come plus self-discovery plus leeches as a boy’s proxy-period. And Corey. Glorious, effortless, pained inside and out, Corey.\n\nBishal Dutta, director (“It Lives Inside”)\n\nE.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nPure magic captured on film. Someone I respect once told me this is the most manipulative movie ever made, and it might be… if you consider breaking down every ounce of an audience’s cynicism to be manipulation. Every choice serves to take us back to the epic, unadulterated scope of the emotions we felt when we were children. If that’s manipulative, I don’t think there’s ever been a kinder act of manipulation in cinema’s history.\n\nThe Karate Kid (1984)\n\nA pop masterpiece that uses its sports drama framework to elevate the rivalry of two dojos to the level of American myth. When you’re watching this film, Reseda and Encino somehow feel like the only two places that exist on the planet while the outcome of the All Valley Karate Tournament feels like the most important (and maybe only) story that’s ever been told, the universality of its emotion peaking in that triumphant final look between teacher and student.\n\nChristine (1983)\n\nA work of shocking psychological complexity. Unlike earlier suburban nightmares (including Carpenter and Debra Hill’s own Halloween), the horror here isn’t penetrating Reagan’s America, but rather it festers within the soul of a troubled teen boy, as if Arnie willed Christine into consciousness with his loneliness and anger. And has there ever been a shot fueled with more apocalyptic dread than Christine, entirely on fire, rolling through the darkness?\n\nDust in the Wind (1986)\n\nOne of the most nostalgic yet unsentimental films ever made. Patient frames contextualize the characters within an incredibly specific place and time, creating a transportive effect that’s never been paralleled for me. This movie gave me a phantom pain; it made me deeply miss a time and place I’ve never visited. It implanted a memory in me with the objective lushness of its filmmaking.\n\nOpera (1987)\n\nViolence elevated into beautiful and viscerally affecting music. You’ll never look at a door’s peep hole the same way again. What elevates it beyond Argento’s other work is its central conceit: the killer forces the protagonist to watch the violence by taping pins to her eyes. Not since Psycho and Peeping Tom had a film problematized and reflected the very act of consuming horror cinema right back at its audience. It feels wrong only because it’s holding a mirror back to us as we watch horror through open fingers, ourselves unable to look away.\n\nBlow-Out (1981)\n\nA perfect marriage of cinematic sound and image. Has any other film bridged the audiovisual divide better than this one? Split diopter shots, for example, visualize the process of eavesdropping. An eerily spinning shot disorients us while the sound becomes dizzying in its monotony. One of the post-Jazz Singer dreams is finally and gloriously realized: a film that uses sound and visuals interchangeably as brushstrokes on its cinematic canvas.\n\nTo Live and Die in L.A. (1985)\n\nThe late, great William Friedkin’s definitive crime opus. His brutal, no-nonsense documentarian’s style infects the neon-bathed sunset hues of Los Angeles. One of the great “process movies” in the way that it presents an enigmatic and largely non-verbal Willem Dafoe printing fake money in the most cinematic way possible. And let’s not forget what we would all agree is the greatest chase scene of all time if Friedkin and co. didn’t make it look so easy.\n\nThe Vanishing (1988)\n\nThe scariest film I’ve ever seen in my life. What puts it entirely in its own league is its confident insistence upon presenting evil through the lens of banality instead of any flair or style. It presents horror without fantasy, denying us the opportunity to disconnect from its wavelength. Evil has never felt closer or more ever-present to me than in the moments after this film ended.\n\nThey Live (1988)\n\nJohn Carpenter called this film a “documentary” when it first came out and people didn’t believe him. Watching it today, I’m grateful for the iconic imagery and the fun interludes, like the alley brawl, because without them, the film’s incisive and unforgiving commentary on capitalism, consumerism and America would be unbearably painful.\n\nKoyaanisqatsi (1982)\n\nA towering achievement of the decade. Told on such an epic scale that the teeming masses of humanity become individual bodies transposed against the eons of history etched into the face of the Earth, it recalls Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera in its recontextualization of cinema’s potential. It helps me believe that we discovered cinema so that we could discover ourselves through a lens of perception that transcends our eyes and ears.\n\nDavid Lowery, writer, director (“Peter Pan & Wendy”)\n\n10 Double Features from the 1980s\n\nDO THE RIGHT THING / THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST\n\nBoth of these masterpieces exist in different spheres of cultural relevance, and ought not necessarily be compared but for the exuberance with which they declare themselves Movies with a giant, bold-faced capital M. Lee and Scorsese each embrace the maximalist potential of cinema, using color and camera movement as exclamation points where other filmmakers might have been content with a simple period or ellipsis. That this punctuation is in service of some of the most complex, nuanced essays on individual integrity ever put to film makes them all the more extraordinary.\n\nRAISING ARIZONA / MIDNIGHT RUN\n\nThe Dream Of The Future passage at the end of Raising Arizona is one of my favorite sequences in any movie, and it comes at the end of a statement of intent from the Coen Brothers that remains unmatched across their legendary ouvre. It’s an immensely moving looney tunes cartoon with some of the best dialogue ever delivered. Likewise, Martin Brest’s Midnight Run is a caper with the sort of epic spectacle that would nowadays never be underwritten by a major studio without Tom Cruise’s name above the title – a phenomenon that makes the deep affection we feel for Charles Grodin and Robert DeNiro all the more affecting.\n\nINDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM / ISHTAR\n\nNeither of these spectacles are particularly well regarded, which makes them all the more vital. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is perhaps the better Indiana Jones movie, but its goodness is of a pure and timeless sort, whereas The Temple Of Doom could only have been made in 1984, before it made PG-13 a thing, and in this particular moment of Spielberg’s career, when he was still willing to inject some of the best filmmaking he’s ever done with a mean and sometimes tasteless streak that is somehow as thrilling as any of the incredible set pieces he keeps one-upping himself with. As for Ishtar, I didn’t see Elaine May’s film until long after its cemented legacy had started to show some cracks, and I found it to be…pretty good! And maybe even really good? I’m not calling it a masterpiece just yet, but that it was once-and-sometimes-still-is regarded as the worst film ever made makes its inclusion mandatory, as does the fact that any list of anything could use more Elaine May on it.\n\nFANNY & ALEXANDER / COME & SEE\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that Fanny & Alexander is Bergman’s greatest film. Maybe at some point it’ll slip back down below some of his other landmarks in my esteem, but at this moment it’s the only one I look forward to watching, in its entirety, every single year. So thoroughly does he slip into the perspective of a child that the film cannot help but feel like a reflection of my own memories, to the point that even though I was never imprisoned in a tower by a Lutheran stepfather, when I’m watching this movie I might as well have been. It’s a joyous parable. If Home Alone had come out a year earlier, I’d have made that my double feature pick; alas, we’re all out of luck, as I’m selecting instead Elem Klimov’s Come & See, a very different portrait of childhood, with nary a pair rose-colored glasses in sight, and which I to this day remain too frightened to see a second time.\n\nROBOCOP / THE FLY\n\nRobocop was the first R-rated movie I ever saw, shortly after my dad got a job in Dallas. I had been loath to move to Texas until I realized I was basically living around the corner from where the film was shot, at which point my new hometown became a point of legitimate pride. Its satire remains as sharp as it was nearly thirty years ago, and Verehoven’s blunt, tactile filmmaking represents an apex of 80s action, but I want to take a moment to praise how it ends. There’s no denouement. No grace note. No epic crane shot or musical swell. It just stops. Medium closeup, one line of dialogue, hard cut to black. Similarly, David Cronenberg’s The Fly just begins – and then almost instantly transmographies from a piece of gooey pulp into something so operatic that when Cronenberg later made a film about a literal opera a decade later, it couldn’t reach the heights of this one. If I’d been allowed to see it when it opened, I’d have simply been scared and grossed out. Looking at it – and Robocop, aka American Jesus – now, I understand a whole lot more about the decade I was born into.\n\nLOCAL HERO / THE PRINCESS BRIDE\n\nTwo fairy tales with big hearts and incredible Mark Knopfler scores, one of which is universally beloved, the other which absolutely should be. Hopefully the recent Criterion release of Local Hero brings more attention to it, along with Bill Forsythe’s other films.\n\nTHE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER / MISHIMA\n\nI revisited The Cook, The Thief, HIs Wife & Her Lover last summer, at a Peter Greenaway retrospective, and at the end the entire audience burst into ecstatic applause, leading me to mistakenly believe that it was in fact a crowd pleaser. When I showed it to a group of unsuspecting friends earlier this year, the response was probably far closer to what I read about back in 1989; shock and disgust, outright anger, very little applause. All these reactions are valid and well-earned, as is awe that I generally find myself feeling in the face of film’s staging. This movie represents the apotheosis of Greenaway’s cinematic concerns; I think he’s made better films, but none have intercoursed with the culture as this one did. Greenaway should really only be paired with more Greenaway, and if not, then Blue Velvet would seem its natural bedfellow, as it’s another landmark film from the 80s featuring the darkest manifestation of sexual bile; but instead of a thematic pairing, I’d suggest instead an aesthetic one. Paul Schrader followed up a quintessential 1980s movie, American Gigolo, with a film that explodes the medium just as Greenaway does, albeit to very different ends. Greenaway had Gaultier, Schrader had Eiko Ishioka; few movies have ever looked better, or used the extreme end of aesthetics to pack such punches.\n\nAN AMERICAN TAIL / E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL\n\nThese are two of the very few films I saw in the cinema in the 80s. They also represent Spielberg’s second and third appearance on this list, which is fine by me. I personally take umbrage with Don Bluth’s perspective on cats, but otherwise, An American Tail it still strikes me as a bold and valuable piece of family entertainment, with a scope, scale and emotional wisdom that I suspect did me a world of good. Basically, it made me cry a lot. So did E.T, which was on my Sight & Sound list, along with Do The Right Thing, and had to make an appearance here by default.\n\nSEVENTEEN / FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH\n\n80s teen movies are one of my blindspots. I’ve never seen Ferris Bueller’s Day Off or Pretty In Pink. I think I’ve seen Sixteen Candles. I’ve definitely seen Fast Times At Ridgemont High, which is incredible, and deserves a spot on this list. But it must be paired with Joel DeMott and Jeff Kreines documentary Seventeen, which remains one of the most affecting – and sadly quotable – portraits of adolescents in America that I’ve ever seen.\n\nTHE SHINING / BEETLEJUICE / POSSESSION\n\n80s Horror is such a genre unto itself that I’m somewhat perplexed to find myself veering away from VHS classics like Halloween 4, Return Of The Living Dead, Motel Hell or even something classier like the original Nightmare On Elm Street, and picking instead a film as ubiquitous as The Shining. But! I just finished reading Lee Unkrich and J.W. Rinzler’s exhaustive and essential new book on that film’s production, and, redolent in the ephemeral details that somehow cohered into such an uncanny piece of genre filmmaking, I have no choice but to include it. It’s simply too good. That being said, let me propose two more to make a triple feature, each a different version of the same story: Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice and Andrzej Zulawski’s Possession. All three represent a portrait of the nuclear family in crisis; sadly, only one of them inspired an action figure line.\n\nEli Roth, writer, director (“Thanksgiving”)\n\nMy Awesome list of Awesome 80s movies\n\nby Eli Roth\n\nIf there’s one word to define the 80s, it’s awesome. Totally awesome. Be it big special effects, bawdy sex comedies or bloody horror films, the 80’s went BIG. I don’t want to write about the usual great films (E.T, Ghostbusters, Aliens, Blues Brothers, Diva, Revenge of the Nerds, Beverly Hills Cop), I’ll leave that to everyone else. I also didn’t want to write about films I have previously praised extensively in the press (Cannibal Holocaust, Mother’s Day, Zapped, Evil Dead, The Thing). So here are ten totally awesome 80’s movies I will never turn off if I come across them watching late night cable.\n\nPorky’s 1982. Bob Clarke\n\nWhen I was a kid, cable TV wasn’t mainstream yet, so seeing an R rated movie in the theater was a big deal. Not only did you get to see things you never saw on television, you got bragging rights at school as you’d graphically describe (and often embellish) all the things that you now had knowledge of that other kids could only dream about. Every year, on my birthday, my parents let me choose an R rated movie to see. Any film I wanted. 1981 was “Excalibur,” which was pretty hard to top. So the following year, I chose “Quest for Fire” because the cavemen looked cool. Well, about ten minutes into it I realized not much was going to happen, so I looked at my parents and said “Can we go sneak into Porky’s?” That they acquiesced and slipped into the theater next door was probably the most fun I ever had on a birthday. Actually sneaking into Porky’s with my parents. I actually felt like one of the kids from Angel Beach sneaking into the girls locker room. Bob Clarke was an under appreciated genius. He started three subgenera: the holiday slasher film with “Black Christmas,” the sex comedy with “Porky’s”, and the holiday Christmas comedy with “A Christmas Story.” The film really holds up, too, with a brilliant performance by Scott Columby, who is so unrecognizable as the sensitive yet tough Brian Schwartz that it took years before I realized he played DeNunzio in “Caddyshack.” Speaking of…\n\nCaddyshack 1980. Harold Ramis\n\nI have seen this movie too many times to count. I don’t even watch it as a comedy anymore, to me it’s a record of all the times I had fun with friends watching this movie. Further proof of the genius of National Lampoon co-founder Doug Kenney, who sadly died after the film’s poor reception. Chevy Chase was rumored to have said “He fell looking for a place to jump.” I cannot wait for the jokes made about me upon my death.\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High 1982. Amy Heckerling\n\nAwesome. Totally awesome. What else can I say. I saw that movie in Massachusetts and said I was born in the wrong town. I should have grown up at the Sherman Oaks galleria. Back then California might as well have been outer space. One of the most brilliant teen dramas of all time, sold as a sex comedy, but really a masterpiece coming of age film with one of the greatest casts ever assembled. It’s so fun, so real, so pure, so honest, and never has the parents interfering and lecturing the kids. And yeah, the Phoebe Cates scene by the sprinkler. Masterpiece.\n\nLast American Virgin 1982 Boaz Davidson\n\nAlong with Porky’s and Fast Times, this is the best teen sex comedy of the 80s. A remake of the best gags of the “Lemon Popsicles” films (specifically “Lemon Popsicles 2: Hot Bubblegum”), director Boaz Davidson’s wild movie has 80 minutes of hilarious teen antics, punctuated by one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together by Billy Gerber, with one of the strangest most unexpected endings ever put in a mainstream film. Not since Fernando DiLeo’s “Avere Vent’anni” twist did an audience so expect they were getting one thing and up until the last scene they got another. But it’s the dark ending that makes it stand the test of time as a masterpiece, because it’s honest and real. It’s what really happens in teen relationships. The ending is the reason the film wasn’t a blockbuster, but the ending is what makes the film so unforgettable. I am a huge fan of Davidson’s Israeli “Lemon Popsicles” series, and this was his attempt at an American remake. I hosted a screening at the New Beverly and reunited the cast and got some amazing stories about them.\n\nFriday the 13th Part III in 3D 1982. Steve Miner\n\nMan, 1982 was an incredible year for movies. But of all the horror films I could write about, Friday the 13th Part III stands out for one big reason. Not only was it in headache-inducing blue/red 3-D, it was a part 3. When the hell had that ever happened before? How could you make part 3, didn’t the killer die? Well, no. I mean, he did, but he came back. And not only did he come back, he went to the horror movie gym in the off season and came back as a 6 foot 8 inch monster who’s absolutely unkillable. And guess what? Audiences didn’t care. It was the first time you were rooting for the killer. No one wanted the kids to survive, they wanted to see them get hacked to pieces. And there’s one key invention to this script written by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson – that forever changed horror. The hockey mask. Jason didn’t have the mask until this film when he kills someone and puts it on. And thus, an icon was born. Friday the 13th part 3 is the day he truly became Jason, and after that slasher films were just different. People didn’t worry about killing the bad guy, you could always bring him back. We just wanted the blood. Plus it was in 3D. What more could a budding horror director ask for?\n\nPieces 1982 Juan Piquér Simon\n\nBasket Case 1982 Frank Henenlotter\n\nThe tagline? “It’s exactly what you think it is.” And “You Don’t have to go to Texas for a Chainsaw Massacre.” I rented this movie on a double bill with “Basket Case” in my mind the two are forever linked, so I’m counting the double bill as one film. It was probably the best night I’ve ever had renting VHS tapes. “Pieces” is an absolutely batshit crazy slasher film where the chainsaw killings are finally ON CAMERA. As much as I loved “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre”, when I was a kid there just wasn’t enough chainsaw massacring. Well, “Pieces” solved that problem, and created what is probably my favorite slasher film of all time. From the random kung-fu scenes to the absurd tennis match, to the recycled Stelvio Cipriani score from “Un’ombra Nell’ombra”, “Pieces” stands the test of the of the most fun you will have watching a horror movie with a group of friends.\n\n“Basket Case” seems like a harmless movie about a man with his deformed side appendage brother who was severed in experimental surgery so he carries him around in a basket seeking revenge on the doctors who separated them. It’s also a document of the pre-Disney sleazy era Times Square, which as a kid was scarier than the monster in any movie. But what makes the film special is the last ten minutes. It goes to a place that few films I have ever seen go to. It’s so uncomfortable it just makes you want to take a shower. You think you can’t get disturbed by a film this ridiculous and then the last ten minutes happen and you find yourself picking your jaw up off the floor. That to me is the greatest achievement in cinema and few films pull it off the way this one does.\n\nSleepaway Camp 1983 Robert Hiltzik\n\nThe final shot of this film was so shocking and insane that my friends screamed at the top of our lungs so loud and sustained my parents thought someone had lost a limb in our basement. Well, in this case someone grew one. You know what I mean if you see it. Just… see it. Don’t ask anyone about it.\n\nHamburger: The Motion Picture 1986 Mike Marvin\n\nThis for me is the ultimate 80s cable movie. You rented a few movies, some were good, some weren’t, and you’re gonna go to sleep. I remember so clearly, Jeff Rendell my “Thanksgiving” writer and best friends was at my house for a sleepover, and “Hamburger” came on cable TV at like 1:15 in the morning. I was too tired and went to sleep, but Jeff and my brother Adam stayed up watching it. Well, the next morning the joke was on me because suddenly they were speaking another language. They could not stop quoting it and I felt completely left out of the joke. So, we recorded it the next time it came on. I couldn’t believe adults had actually made this movie. We were so obsessed with it, I hooked up a boombox with RCA cables to our VCR and audio recorded the film, subjecting anyone who got in a car with my brothers and I to listen to the entire movie at all times until we knew it by heart. We would take four, five hour car trips listening to the audio of “Hamburger: The Motion Picture.” Many will argue that my dialogue feels like it’s out of “Hamburger: The Motion Picture” and they would not be wrong. I don’t even know if it’s a good movie, but I love it with all my bloody heart.\n\nRobocop 1987 Paul Verhoeven\n\nI had never seen violence like this in a big budget action movie before. I think it changed cinema. It was so funny, so cool, so futuristic, and so gory it just defined everything I loved about movies. I could measure movies before and after Robocop.\n\nEvil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn 1987 Sam Raimi\n\nIt was my 15th birthday and, again, I could see any movie I wanted. But by now R rated movies weren’t such a big deal. There was VHS. I had seen pretty much everything, including X rated films “Caligula.” But there was one I still needed my parents help getting into – Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn. It was only playing in one cinema near us, and it said no on under 17 will be admitted. We had never seen this. It wasn’t X rated, it was un-rated, it just said no one under 17. We went to a nice dinner before, one that required a jacket and tie, and then drove to some grindhouse cinema in Allston, Massachusetts, where the guy said “Is this kid 18?” and my father looked him in the eye and said “Yes.” The theater manager said “Where’s his I.D?” to which I replied “I don’t have my license yet.” The guy looked at us skeptically. Why were these 3 people way way way overdressed there to see a 10Pm show of “Evil Dead 2?” It didn’t make sense. Finally my father reached into his walled, and do something I had never seen him do before. He pulled out his Harvard University faculty I.D. and said “I’m a professor at Harvard. I’m not lying. My son is 18.” The guy just looked at the I.D. and shrugged and said “Enjoy the show.” And enjoy it we did."
