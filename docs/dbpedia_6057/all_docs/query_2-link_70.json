        "text": "I’m not afraid to admit that I’m the biggest Jonas Brothers fan.\n\nI can write a novel (a series maybe) detailing just how deep my obsession goes, from my encounters with them (like bumping into Nick Jonas on my 16th birthday), to how I covered my room in floor-to-ceiling posters of the band or how I have the ‘Jonas Brothers’ as a keyword on Slack to notify me if anything comes up at work in regards to them. Yes, I’m that fan.\n\nSo when I got a notification on Slack last year that they were performing outside of my office building (remember when going in the office was a thing?), my mind went into fangirl mode. I can’t remember what I was working on that day, but I knew for sure that my coworkers were about to see a side of me they had never witnessed before, and I was both nervous and excited to show off my stan life.\n\nMy first thought: Was this fate? Why in the world, out of all places, were they in Hudson Yards? I watch the messages and videos pour in and my 2010 self came up in my head at the thought of missing it. (For context: I once cried in the Time Square McDonald’s for missing the chance to meet them...for the second time. Wow, I’m really exposing myself here, but the love is real.)"
