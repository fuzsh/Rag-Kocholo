        "text": "What else she’s been in: Gossip Girl, A Simple Favor, The Shallows, The Age of Adaline, The Town, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nIn It Ends With Us, Lively plays Lily Bloom, a college graduate who has recently lost her father and is processing her parents' turbulent and often violent relationship. She moves to Boston to fulfill her dream of owning her own business, eventually opening a flower shop. Lily also gets involved in a messy love triangle, which is where all the drama begins. The actress went through quite the transformation to bring Lily to life by dyeing her blonde hair red. And the author, Hoover, couldn't be more thrilled to have her on board. On Instagram, she said, \"Blake Lively, y'all! She's my dream Lily.\"\n\nLively is best known for her iconic portrayal of Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, and she has starred in other noteworthy projects like The Age of Adaline and A Simple Favor. She has also done work behind the camera, directing (and appearing in) Taylor Swift's music video for \"I Bet You Think About Me\" in 2021.\n\nFortunately, we'll see more of Lively in her upcoming films, including The Husband's Secret, The Making Of and Proxy.\n\nWhat else she’s been in: Jane the Virgin, Con Man, Undercover Bridesmaid, Isolated\n\nBaldoni stars as Ryle Kincaid, a handsome surgical resident and Lily's love interest. And as it turns out, Baldoni got Hoover's stamp of approval as soon as she met him. She said, “When I first met Justin Baldoni, who is directing the film for It Ends With Us, I immediately wanted him to be Ryle. I just thought that he had what it takes to play that character.”\n\nBaldoni has been working behind the scenes as of late, directing movies like Clouds and Five Feet Apart. But we can't forget about his scene-stealing performance as the dreamy Rafael in Jane the Virgin. His other acting credits include Happy Endings, Single Ladies and CSI: NY. He first gained recognition for his award-winning documentary series, My Last Days, which put him on CW's radar, the success of which allowed him to found his entertainment company, Wayfarer Entertainment.\n\nWhat else he’s been in: 1923, Vice, Westworld, The Offer, Futra Days\n\nBrandon Sklenar is Atlas Corrigan, Lily’s high school boyfriend and the third part of Lily's complicated love triangle. In an Instagram post that has since been removed, Sklenar responded to the casting news and wrote, “When this project came along I wasn’t aware of this book or the tremendous impact it has had on women all over the world in helping them to have the strength to change their lives. This is something very personal to me.”\n\nSklenar has been nailing his role as Spencer Dutton in 1923, the prequel to Yellowstone, but before he started donning his cowboy hat, Sklenar appeared in shows like New Girl (Loner), Westworld (Henry), Walker: Independence (Liam Collins) and The Offer (Burt Reynolds). His upcoming projects include Fall Into Me, Green & Gold and Favorites.\n\nWhat else he’s been in: The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, The Morning Show, Haunted Mansion, Mustache, No Hard Feelings\n\nHasan Minhaj portrays Allyssa's husband and Ryle's best friend, Marshall—a skilled app developer who makes seven figures a year. On the film's official Instagram page, his character is described as a \"light in the darkness.\"\n\nThe comedian and actor is best known for making audiences laugh on The Daily Show, where he was a senior correspondent from 2014 to 2018. In 2017, Minhaj released a Netflix stand-up comedy special, Homecoming King, for which he won the Peabody Award in 2018. After leaving The Daily Show, Minhaj launched the weekly comedy show, Patriot Act with Hasan Minjah, earning him a second Peabody Award. The comic's second Netflix special, Hasan Minhaj: The King's Jester, was released in 2022. While his comedy resumé is extensive, don't sleep on Minhaj's acting chops. So far, he has appeared in shows like Arrested Development, The Morning Show and Champions. And in addition to It Ends with Us, you can expect to see him in the comedy Best of the Best."
