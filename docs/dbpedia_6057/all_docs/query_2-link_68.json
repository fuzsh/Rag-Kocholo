        "text": "Lily Tomlin is a storyteller. When she talks about putting her show together, when she reminisces about growing up in Detroit, when she recalls the seedling days of her career, she tells, each time, a little story, a tale of Lily, with an introduction, a middle, a subplot and, usually, a punchline.\n\n''I try to get a peek of my audience just before I go out on stage,'' she said. ''I kind of look out over the lights and I am always surprised by the huge cross section of people. There are young people, there are gay people, there are little old blue rinse ladies. There are thousands of people out there, sitting side by side, half of whom wouldn't ordinarly be caught dead together.''\n\nIf there is no punchline, there is most certainly a point of view.\n\n''I had this fellow here doing my hair,'' she said, the morning after a recent performance in Boston. ''He's so cute, his name is Bucci. I wish you could meet him. Every night before the show, Bucci comes to my room to do my hair. My hair's a mess now. I had it cut all wrong, so I need someone really good to hide it.\n\n''Anyway, Bucci stands there, every night, and says, 'Lily, you're great, you're wonderful, you're dynamic, they love you,' '' she said, churning her jaw to imitate the local accent. ''And I tell him, 'Bucci, I love them, because every night I have the chance to go out in front of them and make it better.' ''\n\nThe stage is where Lily Tomlin feels most comfortable telling her stories, and on Thursday she opens at the Plymouth in a one woman show, ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' that highlights her narrative gift. As in her 1977 Broadway production, ''Appearing Nightly,'' this one is a cavalcade of characters. But this time they are not self-contained skits. This time, each character is like a chapter in a book, each a small part of the overall parable.\n\nThere is Agnes Angst, the petulent punk rocker who girds herself in zippers and chains and seems to court alienation, but who sadly confesses that when she looks at her family, she feels ''like a detached retina.'' There are her grandparents, Lud and Marie, who lament that Agnes has ''the manners of a terrorist,'' yet remember her best as a little girl with a chocolate milk mustache. There is Lynn, a 60's activist trying to make it as an 80's superwoman, who exasperatingly admits that ''if I had known that this is what it was like to have it all, I might have settled for less.'' And there is Trudy, the beguiling bag woman, whose insanity proves wonderfully insightful as she notes, among other observations, that reality ''is nothing but a collective hunch.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
