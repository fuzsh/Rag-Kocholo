In the case of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, I want to correct a faux pas I made on Twitter. “I find it fascinating,” I tweeted, “that in test screenings they all hated Ferris Bueller’s girlfriend and John Hughes figured out it was because of one line where she criticizes him. They cut it and her likability quotient skyrocketed.” (“Fascinating and depressing,” I added in a follow-up.) In actuality, the line had nothing to do with Ferris’s girlfriend cutting him down to size. I should’ve refreshed my memory of the incident beforehand, say by rereading this passage from A Long Time Ago in a Cutting Room Far, Far Away (reviewed here), the 2019 memoir by the movie’s editor, Paul Hirsch:\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD disc\n\n****/**** Image A+ Sound A+ Extras A+\n\nstarring Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom, Thomas Chong\n\nwritten by Joseph Minion\n\ndirected by Martin Scorsese\n\nby Walter Chaw Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is an asshole. Let’s get that out of the way. He’s doing a shitty, half-assed job of training the new guy, Lloyd (Bronson Pinchot), in his daytime cubicle hell when Lloyd confesses that his dream isn’t mastering the antiquated data-entry system at their non-descript job, but to start a publication where struggling writers might find an outlet for their work. Paul doesn’t bother hiding his…not disdain, but complete disinterest in what Lloyd’s saying, finding himself distracted by the romance of sheaves of financial documents being moved from one desk to another before standing up and walking away. Paul is detestable. He is The Company rep Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) from the next year’s Aliens, the prototypical yuppie who shows up for a late-night booty call with a stranger in Soho wearing dress pants and a button-down shirt and tie. He is the American Psycho. Paul could give a shit about the voice of the oppressed looking for a creative outlet to contribute to the collective pool of art. He’s all about numbers. He is the reincarnation of North by Northwest‘s unctuous, mercurial ad-man Roger O. Thornhill, whose monogram is “ROT.” (The “O” stands for “nothing.”) After Hours, much like North by Northwest, becomes a nightmare of commodification in which numbers are the source of dehumanization and disassociation. The only reason we really like Paul at all is that we can empathize with his desire to go to bed with 1985 Rosanna Arquette.\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD discs\n\nSUPERMAN (1978)\n\n****/**** Image B+ Sound A- Extras A-\n\nstarring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Ned Beatty\n\nscreenplay by Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman and Robert Benton\n\ndirected by Richard Donner\n\nSUPERMAN II (1981)\n\n***/**** Image A+ Sound B+ Extras A-\n\nstarring Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper\n\nscreenplay by Mario Puzo, David Newman and Leslie Newman\n\ndirected by Richard Lester\n\nSUPERMAN II – THE RICHARD DONNER CUT (2006)\n\n***½/**** Image A Sound A- Extras A-\n\nstarring Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper\n\nscreenplay by Mario Puzo, David Newman and Leslie Newman\n\ndirected by Richard Lester\n\nSUPERMAN III (1983)\n\n**½/**** Image A+ Sound A- Extras B-\n\nstarring Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure\n\nscreenplay by David and Leslie Newman\n\ndirected by Richard Lester\n\nSUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE (1987)\n\n*½/**** Image A- Sound C Extras B\n\nstarring Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure\n\nscreenplay by Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal\n\ndirected by Sidney J. Furie\n\nby Walter Chaw The split in Superman–his faultline where he’s the weakest, the most vulnerable to attack–is there from the beginning. He is a Zen kōan whose existence represents the essential riddle at the heart of any mythology for an infallible, omniscient, omnipotent being. He is an eggshell’s impregnable yet permeable surface: incredibly strong and prone to shatter; seamless but filled with life; unknowably alien and a reflection of everyone’s secret self. An incubator and vessel, the source and the end. He is the immovable object and the irresistible force, the “eternal boy scout,” branded at various times by the terminally unempathetic as “boring”–the rejoinder to which is that he’s been the centre of thousands of stories (tens of thousands?) in uninterrupted serialized adventures since his first appearance in Action Comics on April 18, 1938. Superman has persisted through every era of the United States from the Great Depression to now and every war since WWII, through the fall and rise again of the Ku Klux Klan and every form of mass media, in endless rejuvenating cycles bleeding into each other until their borders become a meaningless melange coalescing into a logo that is as archetypal in the West as the outline of a mushroom cloud. He is the literal “super” man, and somehow he means the most to the bullied and the broken–not as a fantasy of retribution, but as hopeful indication that even the most perfect of us are beset by doubt and alienation. He is the essential shining metaphor for post-modern existentialism.\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD disc\n\n**½/**** Image A- Sound A Extras B-\n\nstarring Jennifer Beals, Michael Nouri, Belinda Bauer, Lilia Skala\n\nscreenplay by Tom Hedley and Joe Eszterhas\n\ndirected by Adrian Lyne\n\nby Bill Chambers \"FLASHDANCE.\" It's hardly a coincidence the Rocky movies started this way, with the title scrolling horizontally across the screen like a ring girl's sign for the upcoming round. Then we fade up on our heroine, mythologized via obscured features, cycling confidently through the city to the anthemic strains of the late Irene Cara's \"Flashdance… What a Feeling\"–a montage that riffs on the iconic opening titles of Saturday Night Fever. And that, in a nutshell, is Flashdance: Rocky meets Saturday Night Fever, albeit with a female lead and considerably less dramatic tension than either. It is perhaps more that referencing these pop-culture juggernauts at the outset establishes a vernacular, translating a movie for the masses that only half-heartedly yields to formula. Flashdance is weird with a beard. It's elliptical and largely free of plot, featuring a modern-day fairytale heroine navigating an urban jungle awash in mimes and breakdancers (but curiously few cars), which is captured voyeuristically with long lenses and natural light like cinéma vérité­­ on Mars.\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD disc\n\n****/**** Image B- Sound A+ Extras A+\n\nstarring Peter MacNicol, Caitlin Clarke, Ralph Richardson, Chloe Salaman\n\nscreenplay by Hal Barwood & Matthew Robbins\n\ndirected by Matthew Robbins\n\nby Walter Chaw When I first reviewed Matthew Robbins’s Dragonslayer upon its DVD release 20 years ago, I said the picture could be read as an allegory for the passing of the 1970s and, with it, the auteur-driven New American Cinema, which was losing favour to the blockbuster mentality that dominates Hollywood production to this day. The directors were the wizards, tied to their decrepit and pain-ridden dragons, and they were, in 1981, up against the reality of an administration perpetuated by a myth of American exceptionalism that would serve as a course correction from the predominantly downbeat, paranoid films of the previous decade. I don’t know that I’ve gotten any smarter in the years following my initial assessment of a work that has been dear to me since I saw it as a terrified eight-year-old, cowering beneath my seat in the long-defunct and paved-over Lakeside Twin, but I do know I’ve gotten measurably more pessimistic about our prospects. I think you can know things are broken when you’re young (and 29 didn’t seem so young at the time, but it is) without knowing how irreparably broken they are. And you can feel hopeless without knowing just how hopeless. When I watch Dragonslayer in 2023, I see a work about the rise of Christofascism and the prosperity gospel, about governments we trust to protect us making deals with monsters to enrich and empower themselves at the expense of the people who rely on them, and about the steady eradication of belief that there are any heroes left with the will or the wherewithal to save us.\n\nDISCIPLES OF THE CROW (1983)\n\n***½/****\n\nstarring Eleese Lester, Gabriel Folse, Steven Young, Martin Boozer\n\nbased on the story “Children of the Corn” by Stephen King\n\nadapted for the screen and directed by John Woodward CHILDREN OF THE CORN (1984)\n\nStephen King’s Children of the Corn\n\n**½/****\n\nstarring Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton, R.G.

I first read Stephen King’s same-named short story in the movie tie-in edition of Night Shift (the one with the red cover) in sixth grade and loved the Lovecraft of it, how it begins in the middle with a car-tripping couple hitting a kid running out of a cornfield in bumblefuck, Nebraska and leads said couple through a forensic reconstruction of the doom that came to Gatlin. I see in its setup and execution both the tendrils leading backwards and the ones nourishing stories like Clive Barker’s “In the Hills, the Cities.” It has a feeling of the inevitable uncanny that is underestimated in King’s best work: a sense that what is happening has almost finished happening, and it’s too late to do anything but bear witness to our collective ruin. Of the dozen films in the eclectic Children of the Corn franchise, only the third feature, subtitled Urban Harvest, hints at that feeling of Elder Gods infecting the innocent to act against the innocent and the generational end times attending that. None of the rest deal with the horror of good kids from loving families falling into an apocalyptic blood cult and suddenly murdering all of the grown-ups, choosing instead to paint the victims as abusive or absentee so that they kind of deserve whatever’s coming to them. That’s a revenge fantasy, not horror.\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p version\n\n***/**** Image A Sound A- Commentary B\n\nstarring Chevy Chase, Beverly D’Angelo, Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn\n\nwritten by John Hughes\n\ndirected by Jeremiah Chechik\n\nUpdated to correct an embarrassing blunder on 12/28/2022.-Ed.\n\nby Bill Chambers After turning in a subpar first draft of National Lampoon’s European Vacation and ghosting the production thereafter, John Hughes made an unexpected return to the franchise by writing and producing National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, loosely basing his screenplay, like that of the first …Vacation, on one of his short stories for NATIONAL LAMPOON magazine. Both “Vacation ’58” and “Christmas ’59” are written as a childhood reminiscence and get their humour from the discordant pairing of morbid memories and misty-eyed prose. (Think Jean Shepherd in charge of the police blotter.) There is no Clark Griswold per se in these stories, only a hazy father figure coming unglued. As a result, Hughes butted heads with director Harold Ramis on the original, since Ramis was making a Chevy Chase vehicle, not a coming-of-age flick. By Christmas Vacation, Hughes was at a different place in his personal and professional lives, raising children and turning mogul, and the film finds him identifying with the patriarch almost to the exclusion of the kid characters. His screenplay, in fact, reclaims Clark from Amy Heckerling’s aimless and conceptually fuzzy European Vacation, seizing on the pressure cooker of the holiday season as a poignant trigger for Clark’s compulsive need to contrive Kodak, nay, Hallmark moments.\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p version\n\nPOLTERGEIST\n\n****/**** Image A+ Sound A Extras B\n\nstarring JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson, Beatrice Straight, Heather O’Rourke\n\nscreenplay by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais & Mark Victor\n\ndirected by Tobe Hooper\n\nTHE LOST BOYS\n\n***/**** Image A Sound B+ Extras C+\n\nstarring Corey Feldman, Jami Gertz, Corey Haim, Dianne Wiest\n\nscreenplay by Janice Fischer & James Jeremias and Jeffrey Boam\n\ndirected by Joel Schumacher\n\nby Bill Chambers Although Walter Chaw’s already written definitive reviews of Poltergeist and The Lost Boys for this site, so much time has passed since they were published that I feel obliged to say something original about these films before moving on to the Blu-ray portion of this review. Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist and Joel Schumacher’s The Lost Boys, each celebrating milestone anniversaries this year (fortieth and thirty-fifth, respectively), have aged unusually gracefully. Partly this is due to the Star Wars-festooned bedroom of Poltergeist and the comics-store hub of The Lost Boys being evergreen–though what was once indicated by Robbie’s C-3PO lightswitch cover (his middle-class privilege) and Sam’s pedantic knowledge of Superman lore (his lack of social life) may not come across as clearly to a generation of viewers that has grown up with Jedis and superheroes as the inescapable sum of pop culture. Moreover, these are not naïve films that invite condescension, and any doubts about their sophistication (aesthetic and otherwise) are laid to rest by the instantly dated attempts to drag them into the 21st century: Gil Kenan’s remake of Poltergeist and the dtv sequel Lost Boys: The Tribe.\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p version\n\n**½/**** Image B- Sound A- Extras B\n\nstarring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, Tim Robbins, Ed Gale\n\nwritten by Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz, based on the Marvel Comics character created by Steve Gerber\n\ndirected by Willard Huyck\n\nby Bill Chambers If you’ll indulge me, as I recall it was at my local Sunrise Records that I first laid eyes on the egg with the hatched beak chomping on a cigar, which became as emblematic of Howard the Duck, albeit not as iconic or enduring, as the gleaming bat symbol would become of Batman three summers later. It was on the cover of a 12″ EP of the movie’s title track, performed by Dolby’s Cube featuring Cherry Bomb, a fictitious band consisting of actresses Lea Thompson, Liz Sagal, Holly Robinson, and Dominique Davalos, who did all their own singing. (Thomas “She Blinded Me with Science” Dolby wrote and produced their songs.) When I flipped the jacket, I encountered a photo spread of Thompson in rock-‘n’-roll leathers and big, crimped hair, and I reacted how any 11-year-old boy hot for Marty McFly’s mom would: I begged my dad to buy it for me.\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD disc.

Lee Ermey. Loves him. Though Ermey is only the fourth-billed actor in Full Metal Jacket, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman may as well be the star of the show. He’s described in Gustav Hasford’s source novel as “an obscene little ogre in immaculate khaki.” His barked insults and obscenities dominate the first section of the film–a tour de force showing how Hartman wears down (and, supposedly, toughens up) a barracksful of U.S. Marine draftees, blasting away at their natural aversion to aggression and reprogramming them as soldiers. Kubrick was lucky to find him; a Vietnam War vet and former Marine Corps drill instructor, Ermey brings an irresistible combination of outrageousness and authenticity to the part. Hartman could have come across as an unlikely caricature but for Ermey’s ferociousness.\n\nNote: all framegrabs were sourced from the 4K UHD discs.

(For a detailed review of the movies proper as well as their 2012 Blu-ray counterparts, our own Walter Chaw has you covered. (The star ratings above are his, the letter grades are mine.)) The new 4K scans capture the camera negatives in all their Panavision glory. Grain is quite present and the image sometimes goes a wee bit soft, especially in shots that were optically printed (i.e., titles, dissolves, wipes, and the like), but it’s never inappropriate or distracting, and I didn’t notice any obvious compression-induced flaws. Many of the special-effects shots look better than ever, as the original elements have been recomposited digitally to fix thick matte lines, imprecise rotoscopes, and similar technical holdovers from the analog domain.\n\n***½/**** Image A- Sound B+ Extras A-\n\nstarring Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Craig Sheffer, Lea Thompson\n\nwritten by John Hughes\n\ndirected by Howard Deutch\n\nby Bill Chambers “Cinema is the most beautiful fraud in the world. In order to criticize a movie, you have to make another movie.” John Hughes may have had this famous Jean-Luc Godard quote in mind when he embarked on the screenplay for Some Kind of Wonderful, a gender-swapped version of his heavily-compromised Pretty in Pink that came out less than a year later. But Some Kind of Wonderful did not start out like it ended up: The script that director Howard Deutch originally signed on to direct was about a citywide first date between a social pariah and the prettiest girl in school that notoriously called for the Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron to put on a private show for the couple. A broad comedy, it opened with its hero masturbating into a pillow. If you’ve seen Some Kind of Wonderful, this will all sound pretty incongruous.\n\n*½/**** Image C Sound A Extras B-\n\nstarring Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth McGovern, Alec Baldwin, James Ray\n\nwritten and directed by John Hughes\n\nby Bill Chambers I rented She’s Having a Baby the moment it hit video out of brand loyalty to John Hughes, whose teen movies had had an epic and indoctrinating influence on my peers and me. And I was largely indifferent to it up until the closing-credits montage of celebrities tossing out names for the titular baby, at which point my lack of enthusiasm gave way to dismay.* At the time, I assumed the film’s subject matter was too adult for 13-year-old me (and it was), but 18 years later I didn’t like it any better, and after revisiting it with another 15 years’ distance–which brings us to 2021–I’ve decided that when it comes to She’s Having a Baby, “it’s not me, it’s you” suffices. Even though the travails of one Jefferson “Jake” Briggs remain as hypothetical to me as they were when I was a kid, movies, as Roger Ebert was fond of saying, are empathy machines; the cinema would never have flourished if films demanded a 1:1 relationship with the viewer’s experiences. (Granted, this is also how they’ve gotten away with being so lily-white for so long.) Definitive proof of She’s Having a Baby‘s mediocrity came for me when I saw Tamara Jenkins’s Private Life, in which a cultured New York couple struggles with infertility as their biological clocks wind down. It was, next to First Reformed, my favourite film of 2018. I’ve never been on that side of the family equation and I’m not a churchgoer, either.\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p version\n\n***/**** Image A Sound A Extras B+\n\nstarring Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, John Amos\n\nscreenplay by David Sheffield & Barry W. Blaustein\n\ndirected by John Landis\n\nby Bill Chambers When I interviewed the great documentarian Steve James of Hoop Dreams fame, he asked me if I’d ever seen Coming to America, and I didn’t know quite how to answer him. There was a time, during my adolescence in the mid-to-late ’80s, when not seeing the latest Eddie Murphy movie would’ve put a serious crimp in my social life–when the extremely homophobic routines of Eddie Murphy “Delirious” (a.k.a. Eddie Murphy: Comedian, which my friend Joel gave to me on vinyl for my 12th birthday) constituted the lingua franca of my peers, for worse or for worse. This was also the age of PayTV and home video, when it was not uncommon to watch a film you liked over and over again until you practically fused with it; I liked Coming to America. I liked it, and lots of kids my age liked it, I suspect, because it made us feel like adults with its titties and swears but basically coddled us with a plot out of Disney and a laid-back vibe to match. I’d soured on it in the years since, partly out of fear it was a low-key minstrel show. I’m still not sure that it isn’t, but anyway, in answer to James’s question, I said “yep.”\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p versions\n\nTHE GOONIES\n\n*/**** Image A- Sound A\n\nstarring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green\n\nscreenplay by Chris Columbus\n\ndirected by Richard Donner\n\nBeetle Juice\n\n**½/**** Image A+ Sound A-\n\nstarring Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Keaton\n\nscreenplay by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren\n\ndirected by Tim Burton\n\nby Bill Chambers Although Walter Chaw and Alex Jackson already covered The Goonies and Beetlejuice (hereafter Beetle Juice), respectively, for our humble little website, I feel obliged to say something about these films before moving on to the technical portion of this review. Firstly, I don’t think I’d seen The Goonies from beginning to end since the ’80s, and it took me a week to get through it this time. I summed up the experience on Letterboxd as “like being buried alive in the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese,” which was equally true no matter where I started from; The Goonies is just so screamy. To a certain extent, that’s verisimilitude–this is, after all, a movie about a gaggle of teens and preteens on a treasure hunt, hopped up on sugar, hormones, and the fantasy of instant wealth. But it isn’t merely that they’re rambunctious–they’re also mean.\n\nTHE DEAD ZONE (1983)\n\n****/**** Image C Sound A\n\nstarring Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom\n\nscreenplay by Jeffrey Boam, based on the novel by Stephen King\n\ndirected by David Cronenberg\n\nby Walter Chaw Michael Kamen’s score for The Dead Zone sounds so much like Howard Shore’s work that if I didn’t know better… Maybe something about Cronenberg inspires doomed Romanticism in his collaborators. What’s sometimes lost in the focus on body-horror in his pictures is how like opera they are–so like opera, in fact, that The Fly was eventually turned into one. Each is in some way about the loss of the self to love and all those elevated metaphors for love like body transformation, breakdown, decay, death. He is a poet of liebestraum. His films are suffused with it, as well as–here’s another German term for you–overwhelming waves of Weltschmerz. The Dead Zone was the first Cronenberg feature since 1979’s Fast Company not scored by Shore; the two would never be separated again. In a CINEFANTASTIQUE article published at the time of The Dead Zone‘s release (1983), Cronenberg tells of producer Dino De Laurentiis desiring a “name” composer and discarding Shore before landing on Kamen, then fresh off Alan Parker’s Pink Floyd: The Wall. I don’t think Cronenberg gave up that kind of control again. The Dead Zone is an adaptation of a Stephen King bestseller and home to one of only a handful of lead roles for Christopher Walken, who’s idol-handsome but, you know, off-tempo. A curious affliction for a trained, gifted hoofer, you’ll agree. I used to refer to Cronenberg as an insect anthropologist, an alien observer, and that’s true, I think. But as I grow older and, minute-by-minute, devastation-upon-devastation, immensely, geometrically wearier, I’m seeing Cronenberg as afflicted by a certain Proustian lost time. The more I know of grief, the more I hear that edge in Cronenberg’s voice echoed in my own.\n\n**/**** Image A Sound A+ Extras B-\n\nstarring Molly Ringwald, Harry Dean Stanton, Jon Cryer, Andrew McCarthy\n\nwritten by John Hughes\n\ndirected by Howard Deutch\n\nby Bill Chambers John Hughes made his mark with screenplays that had straightforward, saleable hooks. National Lampoon’s Vacation is about a suburban family on a cross-country drive to a theme park. Mr. Mom is about a husband and wife switching places as the breadwinner of the family. Sixteen Candles is about a girl turning 16 whose family forgets her birthday. The Breakfast Club is about five high-school students serving detention on a Saturday. Weird Science is about a couple of geeks who Frankenstein themselves the perfect woman. But Pretty in Pink, inspired by though not based on The Psychedelic Furs‘ song of the same name, is an outlier in Hughes’s early filmography in that it’s merely an ode to his muse Molly Ringwald, its collection of feeble pretexts for shining the spotlight on her hardly constituting a premise. It’s a movie that operates on the somewhat shaky assumption that Ringwald, like Anna Karina before her, is cinema, her most mundane gestures becoming iconic through the simple act of photographing them. The ultimate irony, of course, is that when Hughes transposed every non-event that happens in Pretty in Pink onto Some Kind of Wonderful a year later, it resulted in what was arguably his most high-concept project yet: the boy version of Pretty in Pink.\n\n**/**** Image B+ Sound A- Extras A-starring Ben Cross, Ned Beatty, William Russ, Jill Carroll\n\nwritten by Philip Yordan and Fernando Fonseca\n\ndirected by Camilo Vila\n\nby Bryant Frazer The Unholy, a moderately-budgeted religious horror drama from Vestron Pictures, is notable mostly for its outsized ambitions. Sure, it has the B-movie elements you’d expect from a late-1980s genre outing with Satanic undertones. There’s a troubled, tempted priest, a couple of gory set-pieces, and a phalanx of latex monsters that storm into the final act. But it also boasts moody cinematography, leisurely plot development, and a mini-dream team of character actors. Want to see Ned Beatty and Hal Holbrook play a scene together for the only time in their careers? You want to see The Unholy. How about an elderly Trevor Howard, in his final role, as a blind demonologist? The Unholy is the movie for you. Or the recently-deceased Ben Cross as a Catholic priest with an expiration date of Easter Sunday? You guessed it: The Unholy. It’s an unusually earnest variant on those Catholic-themed horror movies that became A Thing in the 1970s, after The Exorcist and The Omen established an audience for lurid horror dressed up with religious themes and prestige names.\n\nPlease note that all framegrabs are from the 1080p version of Days of Thunder\n\nDAYS OF THUNDER\n\n**/**** Image A- Sound B+ Extras D+\n\nstarring Tom Cruise, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, Nicole Kidman\n\nscreenplay by Robert Towne\n\ndirected by Tony Scott\n\nTOP GUN\n\n**/**** Image B Sound A+ Extras A\n\nstarring Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards\n\nscreenplay by Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr.\n\ndirected by Tony Scott\n\nWAR OF THE WORLDS\n\n***/**** Image A+ Sound A+\n\nstarring Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Miranda Otto, Tim Robbins\n\nscreenplay by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, based on the novel by H.G. Wells\n\ndirected by Steven Spielberg\n\nby Bill Chambers Days of Thunder was not a crapshoot; the dice were loaded. Almost the entire creative team that made Top Gun a hit–the illustrious Robert Towne filled in for the screenwriting duo of Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., and none of the soundtrack artists were invited back–was reuniting to do for NASCAR what the earlier film had done for the U.S. Navy’s Fighter Weapons School. Star Tom Cruise had become even more popular in the intervening years, earning an Oscar nomination for Oliver Stone’s Born on the Fourth of July. Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer had such an unparalleled track record, having shepherded Flashdance, Top Gun, and the first two Beverly Hills Cops to commercial success, that Paramount confidently renewed their contract at the start of production. As recounted in Charles Fleming’s unsparing High Concept: Don Simpson and the Hollywood Cultures of Excess, under the terms of their renegotiated deal (a “visionary alliance,” as Simpson-Bruckheimer insisted it be called in the trades), they would receive $300M for five pictures–any five pictures–over five years, as well as a host of unprecedented perqs, including creative autonomy and fully-furnished home theatres installed at the studio’s expense. Days of Thunder would be the first production of this visionary alliance. It would also, quite ludicrously, be the last.\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four\n\n****/**** Image A+ Sound A Extras B\n\nstarring John Hurt, Richard Burton, Suzanna Hamilton, Gregor Fisher\n\nwritten and directed by Michael Radford\n\nby Walter Chaw George Orwell’s 1984 is a fabulously paranoid fantasy in which everything predicted has not only come to pass but proven mild in comparison. Orwell himself failed to foresee how Big Brother’s intrusion into all aspects of our lives would be a privilege we happily facilitated and paid for at a premium through the acquisition of our manifold devices and subscriptions. Cameras and microphones are recording every aspect of our existence…and that’s just the way we wanted it. Capitalism is the most pernicious form of authoritarianism. We are slaves to ease. 1984 is, for all intents and purposes, a plagiarism of Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We, a novel written in 1923 and instantly suppressed in Zamyatin’s native Russia for being ideologically undesirable. It wasn’t published there until 1988 in the temporary spirit of glasnost, though copies of it had been in circulation abroad for decades. Orwell, reviewing We for TRIBUNE MAGAZINE in January of 1947, identified it as one of “the literary curiosities of this book-burning age.” “This is a book to look out for when an English version appears,” he wrote, and suggested that Aldous Huxley had borrowed from it extensively for A Brave New World. (For what it’s worth, Huxley denied the charge vociferously and, having read We, I’d have to agree with him.) Orwell went on to criticize We for lacking political focus in favour of a more general fear of “the machine.” So I like to think of 1984, written three years after this review of We, to be Orwell’s attempt to correct what he identified as that work’s essential flaw rather than a more cynical wholesale lift. I like to think he was driven more by the urgency of the message than by the venality of stolen valour."
