        "text": "You may not think Disney's streaming service would be the ideal spot to find romantic comedies, but you'd be wrong. Tucked in with the classic animated films and Marvel movies, Disney+ has an impressive selection of rom-coms. Thanks in part to the company's acquisition of 20th Century Fox, the streamer is home to gems like \"10 Things I Hate About You\" and \"The Princess Bride,\" as well as Disney favorites like \"The Princess Diaries: A Royal Engagement.\"\n\nOf course, there are also plenty of fairytale-inspired stories that happen to be rom-coms, from \"The Princess and the Frog\" to \"Enchanted.\" A lot of these movies are just as fun to watch as an adult, and many of them have become beloved by all generations for a good reason — they're full of the whimsy that makes a classic Disney film while also offering plenty of show-stopping romance. You're not going to find a comprehensive library of iconic romantic comedies, but there are more than enough nostalgic favorites on Disney+ to fill your queue with swoon-worthy goodness.
