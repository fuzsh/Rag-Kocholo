        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nOf course, you remember iconic '80s movies such as The Breakfast Club, Top Gun, and Back to the Future. But what other films have you forgotten? With their wild plots, cheesy special effects, and ultra-quotable lines, '80s movies are some of the most entertaining of all time. Let’s take a trip down memory lane to the big hair and bigger shoulder pads of the decade to check out some of these movies that just might be worth streaming again (and don't forget to check our our guides to the best romantic comedies, scary movies and coming of age movies too!\n\nAdventures in Babysitting\n\nThe adorable Elizabeth Shue must battle her way through the big city with the kids she’s watching in this comedy.\n\nBig Trouble in Little China\n\nKirk Russell rescues Kim Cattrall from some weird goings-on that somehow involve an ancient sorcerer beneath Chinatown.\n\nAn American Werewolf in London\n\nA walking tour on the moors, an incredibly hideous werewolf, and some wry humor (with a dash of blood and guts) made this a cult classic.\n\nE.T.,The Extra-Terrestrial\n\nThis sci-fi classic featuring a gentle and homesick alien is equal parts adventure and poignancy. The kids, including a very young Drew Barrymore, have to work together to save the day. Yes, it’s sappy, but it’s why you loved it the first time.\n\nThe 'Burbs\n\nTom Hanks and his neighbors (with Carrie Fisher as his sensible wife) are convinced the eccentric new neighbors actually are murderers. When another neighbor disappears, they’re compelled to find the body, with hilarious results, of course!\n\nDesperately Seeking Susan\n\nThe hair! The clothes! The music! Nothing says the gloriously tacky '80s like this movie with Madonna in the lead.\n\nGremlins\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT get them wet, do NOT feed them after midnight, and do NOT expose them to bright light. Bet you still can’t watch this without getting a little freaked out when that cute little fur baby morphs into the stuff of nightmares.\n\nHoward the Duck\n\nLea Thompson (of Back to the Future fame) and a cigar-smoking duck from outer space must save Earth from evil aliens. It involves big hair, a duck-girl romance, and lots of other weird plot twists that famously earned this movie its dud status.\n\nExplorers\n\nYoung inventors and their homemade space craft venture into the galaxy to learn aliens are not so different from us. While not the most creative theme, the movie does feature newcomers Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix.\n\nWorking Girl\n\nMelanie Griffith stars as the executive secretary whose boss steals her idea. When her boss, Sigourney Weaver, breaks her leg, Melanie uses her boss’s connections to partner with an investment broker, played by Harrison Ford. She advances her own career, but things get decidedly sticky after her boss returns.\n\nPretty in Pink\n\nFollow your heart, or date the rich guy? These are the questions teenager Molly Ringwald must ask herself. If nothing else, watch this again for the fashion.\n\nWarGames\n\nThe popular '80s teen actor Mathew Broderick accidentally hacks into a military computer, which challenges him to a game between the U.S. and Russia. Unfortunately, the computer is playing for real, which may start World War III.\n\nTrading Places\n\nWhat causes us to be who we are: Nature or nurture? Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd’s lives are switched by unscrupulous millionaires who make a bet about what shapes a person. Jamie Lee Curtis also stars.\n\nThe Goonies\n\nYoung misfits from the Goon Docks find an ancient map to a buried treasure, which they hope to use to save their neighborhood in this adventure-comedy.\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThis story-within-a-story features a beautiful princess in love with a handsome stable boy, a nasty prince, and a cast of other fascinating characters including a Spaniard seeking revenge against the six-fingered man who killed his father. It’s definitely worth seeing again for the sweet romance and silly-but-quotable dialogue.\n\nGhostbusters\n\nWho ya gonna call when your city is overrun by paranormal activity? The original version of this movie can’t be topped, but re-watch it with your kids and you be the judge.\n\nLadyhawke\n\nIn this medieval adventure, Mathew Broderick is a young thief who must help a knight (who turns into a wolf at night) and his lover (who turns into a hawk during the day) destroy the evil bishop who cast a spell on them. Talk about a complicated romance.\n\nThe Money Pit\n\nTom Hanks stars alongside Shelley Long (of Cheers) in this tale of a couple whose dream house is, well, a money pit.\n\nOverboard\n\nWhen a beautiful heiress cheats a hired carpenter, then falls overboard from her yacht, what’s the result? She gets amnesia, and he gets a mom for his out-of-control kids.
