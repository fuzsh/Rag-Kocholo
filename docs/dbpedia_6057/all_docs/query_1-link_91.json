        "text": "Look, with the recent successes of Anyone But You or even Ticket to Paradise, we’re not saying rom-coms and romance movies are back to full life in theaters, but that their demise has been greatly exaggerated. (Just like our last few dates off the apps.) And besides, in the privacy of our homes? Things are really heating up, with plenty of choices on streaming services, both from abroad and of every outlook.\n\nSo when we put together our guide of the 2024’s best rom-coms and romance movies, we’re looking at PDAs for everyone to see in fawning awe (we won’t acknowledge of any other reaction) and what’s happening behind shuttered living room curtains. This includes It Ends With Us (starring Blake Lively, adapting Colleen Hoover‘s multi-million best-seller), Hit Man (starring and co-written Glen Powell…so he’s got brains to go with the rest of the package?), Challengers (featuring Zendaya in a love triangle and sports shorts), The Fall Guy (with Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in the Barbenheimer reunification we didn’t know we needed), Love Lies Bleeding (the unapologetic thriller with Kristen Stewart and Katy O’Brian), Fly Me to the Moon (Scarlett Johannsson and Channing Tatum take a gambit on romance), The Idea of You (if Anne Hathaway’s happy, we’re happy), and Upgraded (a good old-fashioned rom-com with Camila Mendes).\n\nWe’ve ranked the list by Tomatometer, with Certified Fresh movies first. Whether it’s date night or friends outing, or something to cozy up with a partner (even if it is a pint of ice cream), with all the choices, tonight’s the night you’ll find a match.\n\n#1\n\nMúsica (2024) 96%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 98529%\n\nCritics Consensus: Rudy Mancuso's use of magical realism elevates Música, infusing its familiar narrative framework with a bracingly personal touch.\n\nSynopsis: Based on writer, director and star Rudy Mancuso, Música is a coming-of-age love story that follows an aspiring creator with... [More]\n\nDirected By: Rudy Mancuso\n\n#2\n\nHit Man (2023) 95%\n\n#2\n\nAdjusted Score: 111700%\n\nCritics Consensus: A deceptively dark thriller that's also loaded with laughs, Hit Man is an outstanding showcase for leading man Glen Powell -- and one of the most purely entertaining films of Richard Linklater's career.\n\nSynopsis: Oscar-nominated director Richard Linklater's sunlit neo-noir stars Glen Powell as strait-laced professor Gary Johnson, who moonlights as a fake hit... [More]\n\nDirected By: Richard Linklater\n\n#3\n\nLove Lies Bleeding (2024) 94%\n\n#3\n\nAdjusted Score: 111940%\n\nCritics Consensus: Lust and violence collide to powerfully pulpy effect in Love Lies Bleeding, a well-acted addition to writer-director Rose Glass' growing body of exceptional work.\n\nSynopsis: From Director Rose Glass comes an electric new love story; reclusive gym manager Lou falls hard for Jackie, an ambitious... [More]\n\nDirected By: Rose Glass\n\n#4\n\nChallengers (2024) 88%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 112781%\n\nCritics Consensus: With its trio of outstanding performers volleying their star power back and forth without ever dropping the ball, Challengers is a kinetic and sexy romp at court.\n\nSynopsis: From visionary filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, Challengers stars Zendaya as Tashi Duncan, a former tennis prodigy turned coach and a force... [More]\n\nDirected By: Luca Guadagnino\n\n#5\n\nThe Beast (2023) 87%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 94127%\n\nCritics Consensus: Unwieldy but rewarding, The Beast uses its sci-fi conceit to explore intriguing themes in largely satisfying fashion.\n\nSynopsis: The year is 2044: artificial intelligence controls all facets of a stoic society as humans routinely \"erase\" their feelings. Hoping... [More]\n\nDirected By: Bertrand Bonello\n\n#6\n\nThe Fall Guy (2024) 82%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 107573%\n\nCritics Consensus: With action, comedy, romance, and a pair of marvelously matched stars, The Fall Guy might be the rare mainstream movie with something to entertain everyone.\n\nSynopsis: He's a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and... [More]\n\nDirected By: David Leitch\n\n#7\n\nThe Idea of You (2024) 81%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 92818%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Idea of You offers a welcome reminder that Anne Hathaway remains a thoroughly delightful romcom lead -- and reaffirms that few filmmakers understand the genre better than Michael Showalter.\n\nSynopsis: Based on the acclaimed, contemporary love story of the same name, The Idea of You centers on Solène (Anne Hathaway),... [More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Showalter\n\n#8\n\nCora Bora (2023) 80%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 81408%\n\nCritics Consensus: A low-key comedy with an ample dose of pathos, Cora Bora can be as aimless as its heroine but gets considerable lift from Megan Stalter's stellar star turn.\n\nSynopsis: Cora (Meg Stalter) goes home to win back her girlfriend, and soon realizes it's much more than her love life...
