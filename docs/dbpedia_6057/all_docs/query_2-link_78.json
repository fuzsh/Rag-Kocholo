        "text": "We are teaming up with OKREAL for our interview series, “Pay it Forward.” We spoke with women who we collectively admire to hear what mentorship means to them, the advice that has been most meaningful and the importance of uplifting the women around you. OKREAL is a platform that curates wisdom shared by a range of smart, leading women role models.\n\nSixth in our series is comedian Jenny Yang. We spoke with Yang about where she has found mentorship and her most important relationship: the one with herself.\n\nCheck back next week for our seventh interview in this series. We’ll be talking to writer, educator and graphic illustrator Elise Peterson.\n\nMentors come in all different forms, and are not always people who we expect. What is your experience with this?\n\nI grew up in a mostly Asian American and Latino community in Southern California. In college and beyond, time and time again I’ve had brilliant black women and men mentor me in my political thinking and in handling myself as a person of color who cares about social justice.\n\nOne instance of mentorship that was most unexpected happened in my first political job. Before working in comedy and entertainment, I cut my teeth in politics. My job included government relations (aka lobbying) in the Hall of Administration at the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. I was a young twenty-something wearing ill-fitting power suits and talking with policy staff of elected officials.\n\nOne day while watching a long Board of Supervisors public meeting, one of the staffers, an African American woman less than a decade older than me, broke the drone of the polite proceedings with a simple question: “What do you want to be doing in five years, Jenny?”\n\nI didn’t expect this from her. Up until that point, all I saw was her poker face and we were all business.\n\n“Um, I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it that much. I’ve only had this job for a year and just want to focus on being good at what I’m doing now.” I wasn’t trying for a politically correct answer, just the honest one.\n\nShe reacted with a hint of disappointment in her eyes. She took a moment and said: “Well you should definitely think about it now. It’s never too early. Don’t get comfortable. You need to think about these jobs as strategic places for you to learn your skills and build your connections so you can move forward in your career.”\n\n“Wait. Doesn’t that mean I’m not really committing to what I’m doing now if that’s my frame of mind?” I replied. “No. Do a great job at what you do. Just always keep an eye out for how this can help you move forward into what you want to do. Take what you need and go. Don’t get locked in.”\n\nDon’t get locked in. I didn’t quite understand her words because I was so new to the job and career. In a way, I did get locked in, spending a number of years moving up in my organization, to the detriment of my mental health and creative growth. When I was burnt out and finally had the courage to leave that workplace, I remembered her words and realized how unprepared I was to receive the wisdom she gifted me.\n\nThat was the only time she and I ever had a conversation of the sort. Little did she know how her tiny moment of mentorship would lay a foundation for my shift from day-jobber to self-employment.\n\nWhat is something a woman mentor or leader did for you, that you now try and do for other women?\n\nI come from robust tribe of recovering overachievers. I got great grades at a rigorous small liberal arts college and was super active in campus life. I was struggling to finish my work one semester and frequently sought counsel from my political science advisor.\n\nDuring one of our regular check-ins she got serious with me. She said that at the risk of being presumptuous, she thought I was similar to many other student leaders she has observed over the years. She said that it was clear I was a well-respected campus leader and helpful to other students, but I was also failing to take care of my own needs. She suggested I do some real reflecting on why I keep so busy, implying there was some nefarious motivation behind it all. I believe she said, “There may be something else going on that you need to think about.”\n\nMy immediate reaction was straight up “How dare you?” (At least in my mind.) But what she did was disrupt my thinking and agitate me just enough for me to realize a few key things. I was a workaholic and like any addiction I was ignoring my own needs in order to feed a compulsion to achieve and please others. That was the first time someone gave me this gift of self-awareness. She was also the first person to tell me that it was okay if I didn’t do everything “perfectly” and meet super-high expectations. No one had said to me, “Jenny. It’s okay if it doesn’t happen. You will live. In fact, it may be better for you because you should choose your well-being and happiness over this external goal.”\n\nThat was a lesson I’ve been learning to practice every day since. It is also the kind of attitude I offer other women when their achievements may be too closely tied to their self-esteem and might happen at the expense of their health or well-being.\n\nHow did that experience (of what your mentor did for you) change your career/life?\n\nI have learned to be kinder to myself, to nurture myself and to slow down. It is a life-long process but it is at the core of how I’ve been able to lead the most meaningful, happy and joyful life than I’ve ever experienced before.\n\nI meet so many exceptional, outstanding and talented young women. I think what many of us don’t realize, especially when we are just finding ourselves as young go-getters, is that most of the world is actually not as competent, attentive or as badass as us. I know that sounds harsh. But I know so many incredible, hardworking women who pay so much attention to doing excellent work it comes at the expense of their own self-care.\n\nI think what surprises them is that the world is actually not a meritocracy. That people who are not nearly as talented as they are will get more promotions and opportunities. And sometimes, being really good at something means you get more work than others, and, often, without the commensurate praise or compensation. This is a tough reality to accept and I try to impart this on my interns and others I mentor.\n\nUltimately, knowing this is freeing because it means that as kickass women, we can see things more clearly and be strategic about how we spend our efforts in our careers and projects. Of course, be excellent always. But also consider how you can strategically deploy your excellence to get the credit and opportunities you deserve."
