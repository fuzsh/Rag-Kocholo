        "text": "Columbia Pictures and Wayfarer Studios It Ends With Us, directed and starring Justin Baldoni, and also headlining Blake Lively has moved from June 21 to August 9. The pic is based on the Colleen Hoover novel.\n\nSony believes the film will be strong counterprogramming in the early August frame against Lionsgate’s Borderlands, Amazon MGM’s The Fire Inside and Warner Bros’ M. Night Shyamalan genre thriller The Trap.\n\nIt Ends With Us moves away from Focus Features’ The Bikeriders on June 21, which stands as the only wide release. Following Sony’s Bad Boys: Ride or Die on June 7, the month’s box office will get a big boon from Disney/Pixar’s Inside Out 2 on June 14. The next big tentpole after that is A Quiet Place: Day One on June 28, amid a month of adult-skewing titles that includes New Line’s The Watchers and Kevin Costner’s Horizon, is Illumination/Universal’s Despicable Me 4.\n\nIt Ends With Us is the first Hoover novel adapted for the big screen. Pic follows Lily Bloom (Lively), a woman who overcomes a traumatic childhood to embark on a new life in Boston and chase a lifelong dream of opening her own business. A chance meeting with charming neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni) sparks an intense connection, but as the two fall deeply in love, Lily begins to see sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents’ relationship. When Lily’s first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), suddenly reenters her life, her relationship with Ryle is upended, and Lily realizes she must learn to rely on her own strength to make an impossible choice for her future."
