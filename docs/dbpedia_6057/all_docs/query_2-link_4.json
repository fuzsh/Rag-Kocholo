        "text": "Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, as delightful as they are in \"Lily in Love,\" would be lots more fun in a stage revival of the Molnar play than in this endearing but misfired attempt to update it for the screen.\n\nFull Review | Jun 3, 2021\n\nBurdened with a script that reminds one of provincial dinner theater, \"Lily in Love\" proves entertaining nevertheless. The credit goes to Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, who transcend lame material with bright, tongue-in-cheek performances.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nMakk gives his actors all the room they need to bring this story to life and they deliver.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nThe strength of this contrived farce is its ability to keep tongue firmly in cheek while playing the nonsense earnestly. Everybody seems to be having quite a good time.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nFor a change it's great to hear two fine actors converse and not merely talk.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nPlummer... makes the most of a unique opportunity. His virtuosity carries all before it and makes us forget the creaky artifice of the film and its dangerously inert pace.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nDirector Karoly Makk seems oblivious to the screenplay's rank sentimentality and to the special considerations a comedy like this requires.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Jun 3, 2021\n\nIt has all the freshness and zest of a cave painting.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\n\"Lily in Love\" is an irresistible comedy, as commendable for its wit and humor as for showing off the immense talents of Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jun 3, 2021\n\n\"Lily in Love\" eventually runs out of steam under the unimaginative direction of Karoly Makk. Still, it's a treat to see Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith tackle the leading roles.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Jun 3, 2021"
