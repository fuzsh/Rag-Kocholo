        "text": "From the desk of Laurel Ann Nattress:\n\nIt is always a red-letter day when a book is published by Mimi Matthews. Since her debut novel, The Lost Letter in 2017, I have been beguiled by her writing. In six years she has published 16 novels and novellas, first as a self-published author and now with Berkley Romance. Her rise in popularity has been meteoric, the result of talent and hard work. She consistently delivers, and her fans love her for it.\n\nHer next novel, The Lily of Ludgate Hill, will be released tomorrow. It is the third book in the Belles of London series in which four women, brought together by their love of horses, support each other through adversity and romance. Lady Anne Deveril takes center stage in this story. I found the prose compelling and the second chance romance hard won and worth the wait. Matthews has a gift of romantic tension like few others can deliver. The push and pull between her protagonists was at times frustrating, yet ultimately rewarding. I also always appreciate her peppering of historical details and her inclusion of fashion, family, and fur friends.\n\nI hope you will give The Lily of Ludgate Hill a try. I recommend it highly. It is packed with immersive drama, longing, and romance—all the best elements that the genre can deliver.\n\nBest, LA\n\nBOOK DESCRIPTION\n\nA BookBub Best Romance of Winter 2024!\n\nFortune favors the bold—but is a confirmed spinster daring enough to loosen the reins and accept a favor from the wicked gentleman who haunts her dreams?\n\nLady Anne Deveril doesn’t spook easily. A woman of lofty social standing known for her glacial beauty and starchy opinions, she’s the unofficial leader of her small group of equestriennes. Since her mother’s devastating plunge into mourning six years ago, Anne voluntarily renounced any fanciful notions of love and marriage. And yet, when fate puts Anne back into the entirely too enticing path of Mr. Felix Hartford, she’s tempted to run…right into his arms.\n\nNo one understands why Lady Anne withdrew into the shadows of society, Hart least of all. The youthful torch he once held for her has long since cooled. Or so he keeps telling himself. But now Anne needs a favor to help a friend. Hart will play along with her little ruse—on the condition that Anne attend a holiday house party at his grandfather’s country estate. No more mourning clothes. No more barriers. Only the two of them, unrequited feelings at last laid bare.\n\nFinally free to gallop out on her own, Anne makes the tantalizing discovery that beneath the roguish exterior of her not-so-white knight is a man with hidden depths, scorching passions—and a tender heart.\n\nADVANCE PRAISE\n\n“It is truly a wonder how Matthews can consistently craft fresh romances featuring unique, multidimensional characters who face huge obstacles to their relationships. [A] lovely story of secrets and love lost and found.”— Booklist (starred review)\n\n“Sparkling…Historical romance fans are sure to be moved.”— Publishers Weekly\n\n“Matthews delivers another richly detailed and emotionally tender closed-door romance.”— Kirkus Reviews\n\n“An engaging series installment offering a second chance at love to a spunky heroine and a hero with hidden depths.”— Library Journal\n\n“No one writes Victorian romance like Mimi Matthews, and her Belles of London series just keeps getting better! “— Kate Quinn, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“Mimi is truly a national treasure. All of her books are filled with such delicious chemistry and heart, and her writing is superb. This one is another winner. Highly recommend.”—Isabel Ibañez, #1 New York Times bestselling author of What the River Knows\n\nAUTHOR BIO\n\nUSA Today bestselling author Mimi Matthews writes both historical nonfiction and award-winning proper Victorian romances. Her novels have received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus, and her articles have been featured on the Victorian Web, the Journal of Victorian Culture, and in syndication at BUST Magazine.

She resides in California with her family, which includes a retired Andalusian dressage horse, a Sheltie, and two Siamese cats.\n\nWEBSITE | X (FORMERLY TWITTER | FACEBOOK | PINTEREST | BOOKBUB | GOODREADS\n\nVICTORIAN READING ROOM\n\nJoin Mimi at her Victorian Reading Room Facebook Group for exclusive access as she shares her love of writing, historical romance, Victorian fashion, brooding heroes, independent heroines, and of course, her beloved pets!\n\nBOOK INFORMATION\n\nThe Lily of Ludgate Hill: Belles of London (Book 3), by Mimi Matthews\n\n‎Berkley Romance (January 16, 2024)\n\nFormat: Trade paperback, eBook, & audiobook (432) pages\n\nISBN: 978-0593337189\n\nGenre: Historical Romance, Historical Fiction\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | PUBLISHER | BOOKSHOP | GOODREADS\n\nWe received a review copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
