        "text": "Blake Lively is in the age of Lily Bloom.\n\nA new trailer for Colleen Hoover's It Ends With Us was released on July 19, and the Gossip Girl alum brings all the emotions while playing her florist character in the clip.\n\nDuring the action-packed teaser, fans get to witness Lily's first meeting with whirlwind love Ryle Kincaid (played by Justin Baldoni), who asks for her name after stumbling across her hanging out on a rooftop at night. And if their chemistry doesn't feel palpable enough in that moment, it certainly is in the couple's steamy bedroom scene that follows."
