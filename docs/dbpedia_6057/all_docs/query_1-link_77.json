        "text": "The good news for romance lovers is that Netflix has no shortage in that movie category. Granted, there are a lot more rom-coms on Netflix than romantic dramas, which makes it tricky if you’re looking for films that explore the more serious side of a relationship. But it’s important to have the option to laugh at love’s ridiculous moments as well.\n\nThis month, the new romantic additions to Netflix include Save the Last Dance, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Adjustment Bureau, and Eat Pray Love. These films are very different from each other, but they’ve earned their place on our roundup of the best romance movies on Netflix.\n\nLooking for something else? Check out our list of the best rom-coms on Netflix, the best rom-coms on Hulu, and the best rom-coms on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nSave the Last Dance (2001)\n\n53%\n\n6.2/10\n\npg-13\n\n113m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Family, Romance, Music\n\nStars\n\nJulia Stiles, Sean Patrick Thomas, Kerry Washington\n\nDirected by\n\nThomas Carter\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nJulia Stiles headlines Save the Last Dance as Sara, a teenager whose life is unraveled following the death of her mother. Sara subsequently gives up on her dreams of being a ballerina, and moves in with her dad. She also transfers schools and becomes one of the few white students at a historically Black school.\n\nThat’s where Sara meets Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), a talented dancer who helps encourage her to follow her dreams again. Derek has plenty of ambition of his own, and romantic sparks inevitably follow. However, Sara faces a backlash for dating Derek, even from her friend (and Derek’s sister), Chenille (Kerry Washington). That forces Sara to question whether she and Derek can have a future together.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey (2015)\n\n46%\n\n4.2/10\n\nr\n\n125m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Romance, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Jennifer Ehle\n\nDirected by\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThere’s so much to unpack about the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, including the way it transformed from Twilight fan fiction online into a bestselling novel series. Anastasia “Ana” Steele, as played by Madame Web star Dakota Johnson, is just an ordinary college student who gets to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), like that’s a normal thing that happens.\n\nNaturally, Christian sweeps Ana off her feet with his world of wealth and privilege. It also turns out that Christian is into all kinds of sexual bondage games, in addition to his desire to control Ana. There’s a lot that Ana is willing to try, but Christian never stops pushing the limits of his power over her.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau (2011)\n\n60%\n\n7.0/10\n\npg-13\n\n106m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Thriller, Romance\n\nStars\n\nMatt Damon, Emily Blunt, John Slattery\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Nolfi\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nWhat’s The Adjustment Bureau doing on a list of romance movies? That’s easy. This Philip K. Dick-inspired tale may be a sci-fi film, but the premise is all about a man, David Norris (Matt Damon), who is willing to literally fight fate because he loves a woman, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). What’s more romantic than that?\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau is the thing standing in the way of Dave’s relationship with Elise. They shape the destiny of humanity, and the Bureau will do almost anything to keep them apart. David has discovered the truth behind their machinations, but will it be enough to let him have a life with Elise?\n\nEat Pray Love (2010)\n\n50%\n\n5.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Romance\n\nStars\n\nJulia Roberts, Javier Bardem, James Franco\n\nDirected by\n\nRyan Murphy\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nFor a long time, Julia Roberts was the queen of the rom-coms. However, Eat Pray Love heads into more dramatic territory as Roberts plays Elizabeth “Liz” Gilbert, a woman who is completely unhappy in her marriage with Stephen (Billy Crudup). So much so that Liz starts an affair with David (James Franco) even before her divorce is finalized.\n\nTo find herself, Liz goes on an international journey that includes attempts to connect with her spiritual side. Among the men she encounters is Felipe (Dune: Part Two‘s Javier Bardem), who quickly finds a place in her heart. But can Liz overcome her fears and embrace a potential new life with Felipe?\n\nAnyone But You (2023)\n\n52%\n\n6.2/10\n\nr\n\n104m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nSydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Mia Artemis\n\nDirected by\n\nWill Gluck\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThanks to Anyone but You, Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney are the breakout stars of 2024. And it was a rom-com that helped launch them to the stratosphere. Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) start off the movie hot with an instant love connection. Their relationship quickly goes south over some miscommunication that leaves both blaming each other.\n\nLess than a year later, Bea and Ben are reunited as guests for a destination wedding, and their distaste for each other is apparent. The only reason why they agree to pretend to be getting back together is to make Glen’s ex-girlfriend, Margaret (Charlee Fraser), jealous, and to keep Bea’s parents from pressuring her to reunite with her ex-fiancé, Jonathan (Darren Barnet). But as in all rom-coms, Bea and Ben’s renewed proximity means that sparks are going to fly.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians (2018)\n\n74%\n\npg-13\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nConstance Wu, Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh\n\nDirected by\n\nJon M. Chu\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNick Young (Herny Golding) might have left out some important information when he was courting Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) … like the fact that he comes from a fabulously wealthy family. Crazy Rich Asians’ title is not an exaggeration about Nick’s family, as they are practically royalty in Singapore. And just because Rachel didn’t know about Nick’s fortune doesn’t mean that the family will welcome her.\n\nAstrid Leong-Teo (Gemma Chan), Nick’s cousin, is the only one who embraces Rachel. Everyone else thinks that Rachel is a gold digger, especially Nick’s mother, Eleanor Sung-Young (Michelle Yeoh).

Baumbach, who has built his reputation on down-to-earth films about relatable characters like The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and another Netflix original, The Meyerowitz Stories, delivers perhaps his most profound work yet in Marriage Story. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as a couple who genuinely love one another yet can’t make their marriage work, Marriage Story is one of the most honest, complex analyses of love and marriage you’ll ever see. “Marriage is hard” is the platitude we always hear but this film takes that saying to its absolute logical and philosophical extent.\n\nMarriage Story | Official Trailer | Netflix\n\nAlways Be My Maybe (2019)\n\n64%\n\n6.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n102m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nAli Wong, Randall Park, Keanu Reeves\n\nDirected by\n\nNahnatchka Khan\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAfter a teenage fling, childhood friends Sasha (Ali Wong) and Marcus (Randall Park) go their separate ways.

With engaging performances from the lovable Liu and Diggs as well as the relative newcomers, Deutch and Powell, Set It Up is a feel-good love-fest with plenty of laughs.\n\nSet It Up | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix\n\nThe Incredible Jessica James (2017)\n\n72%\n\n6.5/10\n\n83m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nJessica Williams, Chris O'Dowd, Noël Wells\n\nDirected by\n\nJim Strouse\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nJessica Williams hasn’t quite had a breakout since The Daily Show, but The Incredible Jessica James is the first real chance she gets to show off her rom-com chops … and she succeeds marvelously. Jessica James, the character, may not be quite as incredible as you’d expect but she’s passionate and fun, and Williams plays her with a comedic resolve that makes you fall in love with her. Her chemistry with co-star Chris O’Dowd makes for a goofy, sexy, and refreshingly honest exploration of love after heartbreak. It’s a rom-com simply for lack of a better classification — this cynical but hopeful romp is very much its own thing.\n\nThe Incredible Jessica James | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix\n\nNappily Ever After (2018)\n\n63%\n\n6.4/10\n\n100m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nSanaa Lathan, Ricky Whittle, Ernie Hudson\n\nDirected by\n\nHaifaa al-Mansour\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBased on the best-selling novel of the same name, Nappily Ever After tells the story of Violet Jones, played by Sanaa Lathan, who seemingly has it all — the job, the boyfriend, the hair — until it all falls apart.
