        "text": "This Is The Gracious Way That Lily Gladstone Responded To Losing The Best Actress Oscar To Emma Stone Amid Online Backlash\n\n“Throughout the awards campaign, she always made it about the Osage people,” one fan pointed out. “I always noticed how much more she spoke about the subject matter of her film and made sure to center them even in conversations about her own performance.”\n\nHot Topic\n\n🔥 Full coverage and conversation on the Oscars 2024\n\nIt’s fair to say that by the time the Oscars roll around each year, movie buffs have a pretty accurate idea of who is going to win each category thanks to the award shows that preceded it.\n\nHowever, this year the same couldn’t be said for the Best Actress category, which was widely regarded to be a two-horse race between Emma Stone and Lily Gladstone this awards season.\n\nWhile Emma won the Bafta for her performance in Poor Things, Lily took home the Screen Actors Guild award for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Meanwhile, they both won Golden Globes, with Emma being recognized in the Musical or Comedy category, and Lily in Drama.\n\nBuzzFeed TrendingHot Topic\n\nThe Oscars have finally arrived! Keep up with the losers, winners, and best dressed celebs right here.\n\nCheck out our Oscars coverage\n\nSo when the Academy Awards rolled around on Sunday, people were on tenterhooks to see which star would be awarded the Oscar — with there being particular pressure on Lily, who uses she/ they pronouns, winning as they would have made history as the first Native American person to win an Oscar in this category.\n\nBut ultimately, the award ended up going to Emma, who was visibly shocked when her name was announced and even shouted out Lily and their fellow nominees, Annette Bening, Sandra Hüller, and Carey Mulligan, in her acceptance speech.\n\nAnd Lily appeared to be over the moon for her competitor’s win, and was shown beaming at Emma throughout her speech. Later in the night, Killers of the Flower Moon’s director, Martin Scorsese, was seen hugging Lily after her loss, and she and Emma were also spotted embracing during a commercial break.\n\nBut while Lily took the whole thing in her stride, Emma’s win sparked a whole bunch of discourse on social media — largely due to the fact that the Academy Awards has an infamous lack of diversity among their winners, particularly in the Best Actress category.\n\nIn addition, Lily’s contribution to Killers of the Flower Moon far exceeded acting, with Scorsese as well as Lily’s costar Leonardo DiCaprio being incredibly vocal about how vital they were in shaping the script and giving them guidance thanks to her Siksikaitsitapi and Nimiipuu heritage.\n\nAnd Lily continued to center indigenous people in their first social media posts since her Oscars loss, which have been described as “grace personified” after she opted to focus her attention on Osage Nation, the Native American tribe that Killers of the Flower Moon is about.\n\nOsage Tribal Singers were nominated in the Best Original Song category for “Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People),” and received a standing ovation following their moving live performance during the show.\n\nTaking to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday, Lily seemingly downplayed her loss as they heaped praise on this moment by writing: “When watching the Osage Singers at the Oscars, my inner voice said ‘They’re the ones bringing us all up on stage tonight, that’s how it should be.’”\n\nTwitter @lily_gladstone / Via Twitter: @lily_gladstone\n\n“The history in the film and of the moment rightfully belong to the Osage Nation,” she continued. “What an honor to be close enough to feel the drum.”\n\nLily also thanked fans for their support, tweeting: “Feeling the love big time today, especially from Indian Country. Kittō”kuniikaakomimmō”po’waw - seriously, I love you all,” before going on to joke: “(Better believe when I was leaving the Dolby Theater and walked passed the big Oscar statue I gave that golden booty a little Coup tap - Count: one)”\n\nTwitter @lily_gladstone\n\nAnd these tweets couldn’t have gone down better, with one person saying of Lily on a Reddit forum: “She continues to be grace personified. Throughout the awards campaign, she always made it about the Osage people.”\n\nCheck out the rest of our Oscars coverage here!\n\nHot Topic\n\n🔥 Full coverage and conversation on the Oscars 2024"
