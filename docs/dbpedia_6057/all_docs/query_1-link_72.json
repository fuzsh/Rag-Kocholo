        "text": "Positive Messages\n\na lot\n\nSmart, confident, independent people can find themselves in abusive relationships; abusers don't have a certain \"look\" or come from a certain class; and abusive relationships can be emotionally complex, so we shouldn't make blanket judgments about people who end up in one. But if you find yourself in this kind of situation, you've got to get out and end the relationship for good. When we date someone, we date all of their past pain and trauma, whether we're made aware of it or not. Life is messy, and with brave choices, it's possible to leave the difficult past behind and go on to live your best life. Also, establishing a solid relationship before physical intimacy can lead to a more satisfying outcome. Themes also include compassion, empathy, and perseverance.\n\nParents need to know that It Ends with Us is a romance based on Colleen Hoover's steamy, hugely popular novel. The book has been criticized for glamorizing domestic violence, but the movie makes it quite clear that abuse is always unacceptable -- and that smart, confident people can find themselves in an abusive relationship and abusers don't have a certain \"look\" or come from a certain class. The cycle of violence depicted here -- particularly recurring images of an enraged man holding down a terrified woman and hitting her -- could spark feelings of trauma in abuse victims, but the film ends in a way that may be healing. Other violent scenes include pushing, beating, biting, and behavior that indicates the intent to commit rape, as well as verbal references to gun violence and past suicidal intention. While many scenes have a sexy tone, the images are mostly of passionate kisses, sensual touches, and intimate closeness versus anything explicit (though sex is clearly implied). Main character Lily (Blake Lively) holds off on a physical relationship with her love interest until they truly know one another. At one point, she consents to sex and then changes her mind, which he accepts easily and respectfully. An unhoused teen is depicted with humanity and understanding. A doctor smokes cigarettes, and adults drink frequently, including shots, cocktails, champagne, and cocktails. Occasional language includes \"a--hole,\" \"goddamn,\" \"s--t,\" and \"oh my God.\" Characters demonstrate empathy, compassion, and perseverance, and the ultimate take-away is that we shouldn't make blanket judgments about people in abusive relationships -- but if you find yourself in that situation, you've got to get out.
