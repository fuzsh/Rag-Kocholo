        "text": "Get ready for lots of laughs. Netflix is bringing together some of the most recognizable and renowned queer comedians together in a special documentary titled, \"Outstanding: A Comedy Revolution.\"\n\nThe doc is set to premiere June 18 on the streaming giant and is billed as the first doc of its kind to explore the history of queer stand-up comedy as an \"instrument for social change over the past five decades, actively reflecting and challenging cultural norms and values,\" reported Variety.\n\nComedians attached to the project include Lily Tomlin, Sandra Bernhard, Wanda Sykes, Suzy Izzard, Hannah Gadsby, Tig Notaro, Rosie O'Donnell, Margaret Cho, Trixie Mattel, and Bob The Drag Queen, who has been on the road with Madonna in her Celebration tour.\n\n\"Be a part of the revolution. OUTSTANDING: A COMEDY REVOLUTION coming to @netflix on June 18! Check out the trailer!\" wrote Notaro on X.\n\nThe documentary includes a mix of interviews and stand-up performances, as well as archival footage and materials featuring LGBTQ+ comedians. Per Variety, historians interviewed include Dave Holmes, Roger Mason, Shar Jossell, Susan Stryker and Kate Aurthur (Variety's Editor-at-Large).\n\nPage Hurwitz, a television writer, producer, and director who was also behind \"Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready,\" lauded the upcoming film as a chance to use comedy \"to unite.\"\n\n\"The comedians in this film have been doing that for years with their trailblazing work,\" said Hurwitz in a statement. \"It's also a chance for audiences to discover comedians that may not have been on their radar and to hear compelling untold stories from some of their comedy heroes.\"\n\n\"Outstanding: A Comedy Revolution\" is ultimately about \"queer liberation, said Hurwitz.\n\n\"We don't normally think of comedians when we think of social movements but the talented artists in this film helped to shift the culture in significant ways, sometimes having to make great personal sacrifices,\" she said. \"I hope this film honors and celebrates their contributions to LGBTQ+ history and to the larger community. This film has been a true labor of love and I'm grateful to Netflix for their support.\"\n\nAdditional comedians interviewed for the doc include Bruce Vilanch, Fortune Feimster, Gina Yashere, Guy Branum, James Adomian, Jim David, Joel Kim Booster, Judy Gold, KJ Whitehead, Mae Martin, Marsha Warfield, Matteo Lane, Patti Harrison, River Butcher, Robin Tran, Robin Tyler, Roz Hernandez, Scott Thompson, Solomon Georgio, Suzanne Westenhoefer and Todd Glass, Variety reports.\n\nHurwitz and Wanda Sykes, for Push It Productions, are executive producers, and Katherine LeBlond for Union Editorial, and Brian Graden, Dave Mace and LB Horschler for Brian Graden Media."
