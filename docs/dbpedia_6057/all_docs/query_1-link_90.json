        "text": "Adapted from Colleen Hoover’s 2016 New York Times bestseller, It Ends With Us arrives as one of the year’s most anticipated movies — at least for the fans of the novel, and they number in the millions.\n\nStill, you don’t necessarily need to be familiar with the source material — nor the saga of its runaway success on #BookTok — for the movie to resonate.\n\nWarning: This review discusses domestic violence.\n\nAn auburn-haired Blake Lively stars as Lily Blossom Bloom, a budding — you guessed it — florist who’s about to open her very first store on a quaint, picture-perfect street in downtown Boston.\n\nHaving just returned from her estranged father’s funeral, she’s perched on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building when she makes the acquaintance of one of its residents, Ryle Kincaid (played by the film’s director, Justin Baldoni), a hunky, menswear-catalogue mannequin who also happens to be a neurosurgeon.\n\nHe’s clearly a catch, even if he does make an entrance — in one of the film’s none-too-subtle overtures — by drop-kicking a chair, and point-blank propositioning Lily for sex within moments of their meeting. There’s a spark, but nothing quite comes of it; the attraction is left to simmer.\n\nBut it just so happens that Ryle is the brother of Lily’s new shop assistant and confidante Allysa (a typically buoyant Jenny Slate), and so pretty soon the tentative lovers are back in each other’s lives — and arms.\n\nMoving at a dizzy clip, the film whips up a convincing romance between its two leads, laying on the honeyed photography, postcard-pretty locations and montages set to the kind of swoony pop — including a track from Lively’s bestie, Taylor Swift — that conveys the rush of new love. It looks for all the world like an aspirational lifestyle commercial, full of gorgeous people and tasteful, high-end apartments — a fantasy that underlines the precarity of things that can seem a little too good, and too soon.\n\nAnd as readers of Hoover’s novel will know, it’s very much a deceptively glossy pitch. Behind Ryle’s dreamy facade lies an unprocessed darkness that the film withholds with an effective degree of restraint, although even the uninitiated viewer won’t be entirely convinced by Ryle’s Prince Charming act; there’s something a little too forceful about his affection for Lily, and Baldoni’s performance always seems focused on the narrative endgame.\n\nRyle’s unravelling is also foreshadowed by a succession of flashbacks, in which the teenage Lily (an excellent Isabela Ferrer, doing an uncanny impression of Lively) bears witness to her abusive father, and befriends a schoolmate, Atlas (Alex Neustaedter), who’s fled his own abusive home environment. These sequences may be heavy-handed, but they’re also tender, and lay the groundwork for the film’s more devastating turn — when the adult Atlas (Brandon Sklenar) reappears in Lily’s life, it’s a cue for Ryle to tighten his grip.\n\nNot having read the book, I can’t say for sure how effectively the film translates its tone, but it seems fair to say that it captures what made the material resonate: a clear insight into the insidious patterns of manipulation in a relationship, and a belief — as the title implies — in the strength it takes to break generational cycles of abuse.\n\nDespite its occasionally contrived plotting and what many might consider an overly neat resolution, the movie goes to some dark places that feel true to the nature of abusive relationships; by nesting its trauma within a sunny, romantic exterior, it manages to catch its audience — like Lily, who’s forced to equivocate Ryle’s ‘accidental’ blows — off guard.\n\nFor those who haven’t read the novel, the story’s big emotional twist, if it could be described in those terms, is a moment of real catharsis on screen. It’s a credit to Lively’s underrated talent as a performer that she plays it so subtly, magnifying the dramatic sting.\n\nAs a piece of cinema, It Ends With Us isn’t likely to win over any new converts to Hoover’s writing. But whatever its faults, there’s something to be said for the way in which it gets to the essence of its source material, delivering an emotional experience that manages to be both clear-eyed and thorny in its complexity.\n\nIf you can accept the material on its own terms, it’s hard not to be moved.\n\nIt Ends With Us is in cinemas now."
