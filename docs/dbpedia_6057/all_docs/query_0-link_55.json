        "text": "Romantic comedies: Love them or tolerate them—and let's be honest, you can't hate a rom-com—they're always good for a cozy evening and a life lesson or two. They're also versatile: As with all the best movies, you can enjoy a good romantic comedy with almost anyone in your life, from your partner to your parents to your best friend. For when nothing but a good rom-com will do, those of us obsessed with the genre at Marie Claire have put together our list of the best romantic comedies of all time.\n\nOn this list, you’ll find picks from the genre’s queens, a.k.a. Julia Roberts and Nora Ephron. And while rom-coms are all generally funny and romantic (duh!), the films on our list feature a variety of plots and classic tropes. Are you looking for an enemies-to-lovers romance? We got you—The Proposal made this list. Love watching a couple fake date only to fall in love à la 10 Things I Hate About You style? Same. Stressing over who two teenagers will take to the prom? (Plot twist: They'll meet each other there.) That's our favorite activity!\n\nOur point is that rom-coms are the feel-good movie butter of the film world—they go perfectly with whatever you're craving. We've ordered our list of the 100 best rom-coms by genre, from laugh-out-loud rom-coms to teen versions to bittersweet rom-coms that will make you laugh and shed a tear or two. Last, you’ll find our final section dedicated to the absolute best of this genre.\n\nThe Best Laugh-Out-Loud Rom-Coms\n\n'27 Dresses'\n\nDirector: Anne Fletcher\n\nStars: Katherine Heigl, James Marsden, Malin Akerman\n\nRom-com tropes: Opposites attract, third-act declarations of love\n\nThis movie has dozens of gorgeous dresses and a \"Bennie and the Jets\" bar duet between Katherine Heigl and James Marsden. What more could you want? For anybody who feels like a forever bridesmaid, this 2008 movie will have you laughing and crying all at once.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' (2005)\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\n\nStars: Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogan\n\nRom-com tropes: The makeover\n\nThe 2000s were one hell of a time for romantic comedies, with The 40-Year-Old Virgin reigning as one of the most hilarious movies to come out of the period. This film marked Judd Apatow as a standout comedic director who can brilliantly weave together comedy and sweetness, and it's not the only film of his you'll find on this list. It also cemented Steve Carell as a comedy star as he would later go on to reach iconic status in The Office.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nDirector: Peter Segal\n\nStars: Drew Berrymore, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider\n\nRom-com tropes: Fantasy/vacation setting\n\nReuniting once again after starring in The Wedding Singer together, Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler's chemistry is undeniable in 50 First Dates (2004). Sandler plays a man named Henry who falls in love with a woman named Lucy (Barrymore) who has short-term memory loss. Every day, Henry tries to get Lucy to fall in love with him until she remembers him.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Anyone But You' (2023)\n\nDirector: Will Gluck\n\nStars: Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, GaTa\n\nRom-com tropes: Enemies to lovers, fake dating\n\nAfter a bungled one-night stand, much to their horror, Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) wind up at the same intimate wedding in Sydney, Australia where Bea’s parents are pressuring her to get back with the guy she recently dumped and Ben is desperate to win back his Aussie teenage fling. What else is there to do besides pretend to be dating to make his ex jealous and get her parents off her back?\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Coming to America' (1988)\n\nDirector: John Landis\n\nStars: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Shari Headley,\n\nRom-com tropes: Opposites attract\n\nThere's a literal royal romance at the heart of this classic Eddie Murphy film. Prince Hakeem of the fictional nation Zamunda (Murphy) travels to Queens, NY, to find his true love, rather than have an arranged marriage. He falls for local beauty Lisa (Shari Headley), but he has to win her away from her Jheri-curl sporting boyfriend.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Deliver Us From Eva' (2003)\n\nDirector: Gary Hardwick\n\nStars: Gabrielle Union, LL Cool J, Essence Atkins\n\nRom-com tropes: Fake dating\n\nTwo men hire a sweet-talking Casanova named Ray (LL Cool J) to temporarily court their no-nonsense sister-in-law (Gabrielle Union), but things go awry when Ray also wins over the hearts of their lady loves.

Slate plays a struggling, unemployed stand-up comedian in NYC who hooks up with a sweet grad student (Lacy) and finds herself having to stand on her own two feet for once.

Bynes stars as Viola, a soccer star who impersonates her brother to make the team at an elite boarding school. There, she meets the swoon-worthy jock, Duke (Tatum), and things get complicated.

Fire Island follows a group of gay best friends as they head to, you guessed it, Fire Island, for their annual week-long romp on the beach. Not only is it hilarious, but it's also inspired by Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Happiest Season' (2020)\n\nDirector: Clea DuVall\n\nStars: Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Dan Levy\n\nRom-com tropes: Christmas-time\n\nThis film nails a lot of things simultaneously: It's a funny rom-com, an adorable, sweet, sensitive love story between two women, and a painfully relatable story about complicated family dynamics and how we present ourselves to the world.

It's got everything!\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Idea of You' (2024)\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nStars: Anne Hathaway, Nicholas Galitzine\n\nRom-com tropes: Opposites attract\n\nIn this instant smash for Prime Video based on Robinne Lee's novel, an almost 40-year-old single mom (Hathaway) takes her daughter (Ella Rubin) to Coachella, expecting nothing more than to watch the teen finally get to meet the boy band she’s loved for years. Instead, said single mom catches the eye of one of the boy band’s members (Galitzine), more than a decade and a half her junior. Thus begins a whirlwind romance straight out of a good old-fashioned fanfic.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Just Wright' (2010)\n\nDirector: Sanaa Hamri\n\nStars: Queen Latifah, Common, Paula Patton\n\nRom-com tropes: Friends to lovers\n\nLatifah plays a down-on-her-luck physical therapist who finds herself in the employ of a hotshot basketball player (Common) after he suffers from a career-threatening injury.

Simmons\n\nRom-com tropes: Fantasy/vacation setting\n\nTwo guests at a wedding (Samberg, Milioti) have to relive the same day over and over again, in true Groundhog Day style.

In case you weren't one of the millions to read the novel, the story follows a British prince and the son of the American president who have hated each other since they met. When their sour relationship threatens U.S. and Britain relations, the two are forced to act as best friends, and (of course) this leads to a different kind of relationship. Sure, some parts are especially cheesy, but that makes this movie more entertaining.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Set It Up' (2018)\n\nDirector: Claire Scanlon\n\nStars: Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu\n\nRom-com tropes: Enemies to lovers\n\nNothing's better for our nostalgic hearts than a film that takes inspiration from the best rom-coms of all time.

While this may not be your typical love story, it is a story about love and the loss that can come with it.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Trainwreck' (2015)\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\n\nStars: Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Tilda Swinton\n\nRom-com tropes: Opposites attract\n\nHader should be the leading man in everything.

The film follows Megan (Tipton) as she meets up with Alec (Teller) for a one-night stand, only to be trapped at his place when a snowstorm hits—everyone's worst nightmare, right? What results is a surprisingly sweet time that neither of the two had anticipated.\n\nWATCH IT\n\nThe All-Time Best Rom-Coms\n\n'10 Things I Hate About You' (1999)\n\nDirector: Gil Junger\n\nStars: Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nRom-com tropes: Fake dating, third-act declarations of love, opposites attract\n\nOne of the most clever teen comedies of all time, 10 Things I Hate About You is a classic for its whip-smart script and hilarious camaraderie between the actors (see: a young Ledger and Gordon-Levitt). That's not to mention all the signature rom-com moments, from epic dance and song scenes (honestly, it's worth watching just for Ledger's immortal dance number with a marching band) to public declarations of love.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'13 Going on 30' (2004)\n\nDirector: Gary Winick\n\nStars: Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Judy Greer\n\nRom-com tropes: Friends to lovers, main character who works in New York media\n\nAll Jenna Rink wants to be is \"30, flirty, and thriving\" until she gets what she wishes for.

Unfortunately, Tripp doesn’t fit into Paula’s usual profile, throwing her off her game and—oops—causing her to fall for him. As a bonus, Deschanel, Bartha, and Cooper steal the show as a trio of delightfully wacky best-friend characters crucial to any respectable 2000s rom-com.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994)\n\nDirector: Mike Newell\n\nStars: Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, James Fleet\n\nRom-com tropes: The meet-cute\n\nGrant and MacDowell led this rom-com classic about an Englishman and an American woman who meet at a wedding...and then (just like the title says) three others and a funeral.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'The Holiday' (2006)\n\nDirector: Nancy Meyers\n\nStars: Kate Winslett, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law\n\nRom-com tropes: Multiple storylines, fantasy/vacation setting, Christmas-time\n\nTwo women (Diaz, Winslett) from opposite sides of the pond who are unlucky in love decide to swap home and, in the process, maybe totally find their soulmates.\n\nWATCH IT\n\n'How Stella Got Her Groove Back' (1998)\n\nDirector: Kevin Rodney Sullivan\n\nStars: Angela Bassett, Taye Diggs, Whoopi Goldberg\n\nRom-com tropes: Fantasy/vacation setting\n\nStella (Bassett) vacations to Jamaica and meets a hot man almost half her age (Diggs).
