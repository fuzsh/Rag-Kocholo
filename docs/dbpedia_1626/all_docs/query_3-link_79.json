        "text": "Updated 2022\n\nNikon EM - A Blast From the Past\n\nFor a while now I have been toying with an idea. Over the years I have owned more cameras than I care to admit. I was never a collector though, meaning, whenever a new camera sparked my interest the old model was sold and the money put toward the new camera.\n\nMost often the improvements were incremental but the newer cameras were always exciting and the old were quickly forgotten. Some of the cameras I have owned stick out in my memory and I have now set a goal to acquire some of these cameras again to see if my excitement will be reignited.\n\nThe Nikon EM “SLR Camera For Women”\n\nIn 1979 the Nikon EM was introduced as an SLR camera for women and it was the cheapest SLR at the time. The idea was to give beginners an alternative to the more expensive options of higher-quality cameras from Nikon and to fend off competition from the likes of Canon, Minolta, and Olympus.\n\nImagine a campaign like that today. Nikon would most certainly be facing a social media storm. Apparently, the strategy did not work out in Nikon’s favor and the Nikon EM did not become a sales success.\n\nI have to confess. This was not my camera but the camera we picked for Diana, my wife-to-be, on a summer day in Toronto in 1984.\n\nAfter hanging out with her photo-buff boyfriend for almost a year, at the time, Di had little choice but to join the ranks as a photography enthusiast and hence ended up with the Nikon EM.\n\nNikon EM in 2022\n\nI had planned to get Diana a Nikon EM for Christmas (really a gift for myself) but the plan was ruined when I found a perfectly mint copy at Beau Photo here in Vancouver for CAD $40.00 (USD $30.00). How could I resist? When Di had the Nikon EM in 1984 it came with the very compact Nikon 50mm f/1.8 Series E lens.\n\nThis lens was made as an affordable yet good-quality alternative to the more expensive Nikkor line of lenses from Nikon.\n\nA couple of weeks later I found a mint copy of the 50mm f/1.8E on Craigslist for CAD $100.00 (USD $75.00). I also found plenty of Nikon EM options on eBay and I am sure wherever you are in the world you can find one on the used market.\n\nNikon EM History and Specs\n\nThe Nikon EM was produced from 1979 to 1982 and was in stores until 1984. Little did we know but we must have snapped up one of the last available copies back in Toronto. Italian car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro is responsible for the striking design which to this day stands the test of time if you ask me.\n\nThe Nikon EM has shutter speeds ranging from 1 to 1/1000s with a 1/90s flash sync speed. On the M90 setting, the camera will operate without a battery at the 1/90s shutter speed and on the AUTO settings at 1/1000s.\n\nThe copper-aluminum-alloy compact body weighs 16.2 oz. / 460 g. The top and bottom covers are made from fiberglass-reinforced polycarbonate plastic. The camera only came in black.\n\nThe Nikon EM has 60/40 center-weighted metering and the needle pointer shows exposure times in the viewfinder which also has the split image focusing aid. The camera has three shooting modes. AUTO which is an aperture priority mode. You pick the aperture on the lens and the lightmeter suggests a shutter speed.\n\nA manual mode gives you just one option for a shutter speed at 1/90s and finally bulb for long exposures. If you want to manually override the exposure, you can do so by adjusting your exposure using the ISO dial. Just make sure to put it back after taking a photo.\n\nYou also have the option to hit the backlight button on the front of the camera which will lower your shutter speed by two stops. Indeed a handy feature, typically for backlit portraits.\n\nNikon EM, a 35mm Full-Frame Camera For $30.00\n\nI know you cannot compare a Nikon EM to modern digital full-frame options but then again why not entertain the thought for a second?\n\nAt 16.2 oz. / 460 g the Nikon EM is about the same weight as my APS-C sensor mirrorless Fujifilm X-Pro3 and it has a smaller footprint. Full-frame digital cameras are often larger and autofocus lenses, in general, are larger also, and heavier.\n\nI am in no way disregarding digital cameras here but merely stating the fact that for very little money you can enjoy the look of full-frame, 35mm photos and you will not have to worry about using digital film simulation in order to get the film look. It just comes with the territory :)\n\nNikon EM in Action\n\nIt strikes me that even the cheapest SLR camera, such as the Nikon EM, from the late eighties/early nineties, feels so well made in comparison to today’s cameras. While you will see improvement in higher-priced cameras, the prism viewfinder is still easy to use for focusing and it is nice and big for framing your shots.\n\nBeing a left-eye shooter, I found it a bit hard to see the needlepoint exposure indicator which is placed on the left side of the viewfinder. Especially in darker conditions.\n\nI love the looks and feel of the Nikon EM but found the size of the body almost too small for my hands. The fact that this camera does not have full manual exposure control could potentially put off some photographers.\n\nI have shot aperture-priority since these cameras came out and love this setting. An exposure compensation dial would have been nice but having the ISO dial essentially gives you manual control to a certain degree.\n\nStreet Photography With the Nikon EM\n\nThe skies are grey and we predominantly have darker days here in November. I loaded the Nikon EM with a roll of Ilford HP5 Plus and headed out into the city. I found it satisfying having to wind the film for each frame and focusing was much easier than the Hasselblad 503CX I was testing a few weeks earlier.\n\nMy favorite lens with my Fujifilm X-Pro2 is the XF 35mm f/1.4 R (50mm full-frame equivalent), so I felt right at home shooting the Nikon EM with the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 Series E lens.\n\nFor black-and-white photography, I usually turn to Fujifilm’s Acros film simulation and I was eager to see how the Ilford HP5 stacked up against it.\n\nFujifilm’s Film Simulation vs. the Real Thing\n\nFujifilm’s black-and-white film simulations are indeed very good and I use them all the time for my Fujifilm X Series photos.\n\nWhen taking a closer look at the photos taken with the Nikon EM and Ilford HP5 it looks more realistic. Perhaps because it is the real thing :) The Ilford HP5 film is at 400 ISO and the grain is quite pronounced and the tonality of the film really shows. I like it.\n\nThe negatives were copied using a Fujifilm X-Pro2, an AF Micro Nikkor 60mm f/2.8D lens, and the Skier Sunray Copybox 3.\n\nThe RAW files were imported into Lightroom and I used the Negative Lab Pro Lightroom Plugin to convert the files. I did very limited exposure and level adjustments in order to keep the files as close to reality as possible. For more sample images see below.\n\nNikon EM Conclusion\n\nYou may never have heard of the Nikon EM but if you are considering a camera to begin your journey with film photography I warmly recommend it. Although the Nikon EM was not a commercial success I would argue it was a success in other ways.\n\nIt still holds up today as an excellent camera and appears to be very durable, and very affordable. It would be an excellent first film camera for anybody.\n\nI got a kick out of shooting this first roll and already have a roll of Kodak Gold loaded, a film I used to shoot a lot in days gone by.\n\nThe first thing that put people off about film photography is usually the price of film and the hassle of developing it but when you can start at such a low cost of entry I think the experience is worth every penny and I am quite happy with the results from my first roll with the Nikon EM.\n\nNikon EM, Nikon 50mm f/1.8 E, Ilford HP5 Sample Images\n\nNikon EM, Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AIS, Kodak Tri-X 100 Sample Images\n\nIn this next roll, I was using the Nikon EM with a classic Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AI-S and Kodak Tri-X 100 black and white negative film. Note to self: Pick up more rolls of Tri-X. I really like this film stock with a fine grain and great tonality.\n\nYou can read a review of the Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AI-S here:\n\nNikkor 50mm f/1.4 AI-S Review"
