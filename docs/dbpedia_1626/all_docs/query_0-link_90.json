Common compound microscope parts include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCompound Microscope Definitions for Labels\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEyepiece (ocular lens) with or without Pointer: The part that is looked through at the top of the compound microscope.

This part rotates to change which objective lens is active.\r\n\tBase: Bottom base of the microscope that houses the illumination &amp; supports the compound microscope.\r\n\tObjective lenses: There are usually 3-5 optical lens objectives on a compound microscope each with different magnification levels. 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x are the most common magnifying powers used for the objectives. The total magnification of a compound microscope is calculated by multiplying the objective lens magnification by the eyepiece magnification level.

It is important to adjust these knobs so that the objective lens is never coming into contact with the slide or specimen on the stage.\r\n\tMirror: Reflects light into the base of the microscope. Earlier microscopes used mirrors that reflected light into the base of the microscope instead of halogen bulbs as their source of illumination.\r\n\tIllumination: Light used to illuminate the slide or specimen from the base of the microscope.
