That logo means that no hazardous substances will be emitted by the product for at least 10 years. And unless you have any actual evidence that these products have less longevity than prior lenses, this is simply scaremongering. The regulation that required marking of this logo came into effect in 2016, so of course older lenses didn't have it. F mount lenses manufactured after this regulation came into effect are also marked with the 10 logo.\n\nVinnie_VdB\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.14 #17 · p.14 #17 · Nikon Plena\n\nrand17 wrote:\n\nThen why the move to a third world country if everything is the same and there using there same people?\n\nJapan has a problem with an aging population and cannot find the people for the job, mass production is not possible anymore.\n\nSure enough are the wages lower of factory workers in Thailand and as Suteetat rightfully highlights is Thailand an economic motor for Japanese multinationals.\n\nI go several times a year to Thailand for business and the way you express your view is the one that has his head so far up his *** that I can only advise you to look a bit further that your hometown or even state, just a bit just so you can have an opinion based on facts and experience.\n\nrand17\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.14 #18 · p.14 #18 · Nikon Plena\n\nVinnie_VdB wrote:\n\nJapan has a problem with an aging population and cannot find the people for the job, mass production is not possible anymore.\n\nSure enough are the wages lower of factory workers in Thailand and as Suteetat rightfully highlights is Thailand an economic motor for Japanese multinationals.\n\nI go several times a year to Thailand for business and the way you express your view is the one that has his head so far up his *** that I can only advise you to look a bit further that your hometown or even state, just a bit just so you can have an opinion based on facts and experience.\n\n...Show more →\n\nLikewise Mr Insulting..."
