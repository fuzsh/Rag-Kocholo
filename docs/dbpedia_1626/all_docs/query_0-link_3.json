        "text": "The Standard for Advanced Nature Observation\n\nObserving nature requires sophisticated viewing devices that have the potential to capture every minute detail. Following Nikon binoculars are specialized for exploring nature.\n\n8x30E and 10x35E\n\nSpecialized for bird watching, these binoculars are fitted with multi-coated optical elements for bright spatial images. Since birds usually sit on high tree branches, bird watchers spend a lot of time pointing the binoculars upwards. To make this experience more comfortable, these binoculars are equipped with lightweight Magnesium-alloy housing and a central focus mechanism for quick focusing.\n\n7x50IF SP WP and 10×70 SP WP\n\nDesigned for seafarers and stargazers, these binoculars are packed with high-quality optics to reduce optical aberration. For bight images, the optical elements are multi-coated and Porro prisms are used instead of roof prisms. Other specifications include rubber eyecups, polarizing filter, individual focus, and a sophisticated waterproofing system for carefree use around water bodies.\n\n18×70 WP WF\n\nThese feature-packed 70 mm binoculars are made for gazing at astronomical bodies in the night sky. Multi-coated optics and a higher 18x magnification do wonders for effortless observation of nearby stars, planets, and the moon. Additional features include individual focusing, polarizing filter, and rubber eyecups.\n\nMarket Position\n\nGiven the number of binoculars offered by NIKON for every occasion, the company has captured a relatively large market share among other Asia-based optics manufacturers. From entry-level models to the finest viewing devices, NIKON does not compromise on quality which is why its loyal customer base has been continuously growing.\n\nIn the past, binoculars produced in Japan were mediocre and sold at affordable prices. This was due to the lack of sophisticated features and high-quality materials. As Japan became more technologically advanced, NIKON started to incorporate advanced optics and high-tech coatings in its binoculars. Many of these changes were inspired by binoculars produced in Europe. As of today, NIKON’s products are on par with the features offered by any other brand. It also must not come as a surprise that the premium binoculars are available in a similar price bracket as that of most expensive European binoculars, maybe even more in some cases.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nNikon is one of the first optics producers to originate in Japan. Founded in 1917, the company has transformed into one of the biggest optics brands that are known and respected worldwide today. Although the real growth started after WWII, the culture of continuous innovation and improvement has given birth to several unique features in NIKON products, including binoculars.\n\nSince the beginning, optics has been the main area of NIKON’s excellence. Before venturing into the industry of sports optics, the Nikkor lenses and F-series SLR cameras were popular all over the world. The same optical superiority in optics has played a key role in shaping the future of binoculars at Nikon. Its premium binoculars are equipped with a special Field-Flatter lens system that eliminates lens aberration for crisp and focused images. Other features that make NIKON the popular choice are extra-low dispersion glass lenses and high-performance coatings, which ensure light transmittance of up to 92%.\n\nCanon Binoculars\n\nCanon Inc. has become a household name when it comes to optical and imaging devices. Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, the company is a Japanese multinational corporation that manufactures a plethora of imaging, optical and industrial products, such as cameras, sports optics, lenses, scanners, printers, photocopiers and so much more.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally named Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory, the company was founded in 1937 as a producer of hand-held still cameras. Since CANON lacked amenities for manufacturing its own glass lenses in the start, cameras released in the early years contained the well-known Nikkor lenses from Nikon. Even though the first-ever “Kwanon” camera was inspired by Leica, CANON went onto produce numerous indigenous products in a short while, such as the world’s first zoom movie camera “Reflex Zoom 8”. In 1955, the company opened its first international marketing front in New York.\n\nFollowing a huge success in the camera business, Canon gradually introduced several new devices to its product line, such as electronic calculators, SLR cameras, ink-jet cameras, camcorders, projectors, scanners, and printers, all of which were successful. Being a market leader in optics, the company introduced several binoculars with image stabilization and Porro prisms in recent years. At present, all of CANON’s consumer and business-to-business products are sold in more than 200 countries worldwide.\n\nProduct Line-up\n\nBinoculars currently produced by Canon are listed below:\n\n8×25 IS\n\nPacked with superior optics and Canon’s signature image stabilization system, the compact 8×25 IS binoculars are designed for traveling and theatre performances. Due to its relatively small size and weight, this portable set of binoculars can easily be carried in backpacks. For stabilized imaging, the 8×25 IS binoculars are equipped with a Tilt-method mechanism which effectively counters unwanted shaking and provides clarity to your view.

If you are looking for a set of binoculars that works well in all situations, the modern 10×42 L IS WP is the answer.\n\nMarket Position\n\nAt 45%, Canon enjoys the largest market share in the Japanese consumer electronics market. Since its inception, the company has gradually secured a reputation for manufacturing high-quality devices that easily compete with European technology in terms of functions and performance. The same can be said for Canon binoculars, which are easily available in all major regions. While many binoculars available worldwide still suffer from unwanted hand-shaking that disrupts their purpose, Canon’s sophisticated Image Stabilization is a highly innovative idea that other manufacturers are yet to incorporate in their products. This technology has certainly provided an edge to the Japanese maker, which has since gained a boost in its worldwide sales. If the company continues to innovate products like these, a time will come when enthusiasts from all over the world will turn to Japan, instead of West Europe and the Americas, for feature-packed quality products.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nCanon’s image-stabilized binoculars are nothing short of an engineering marvel since they combine electronics, computing, and optics to stabilize otherwise shaky images. According to the company, the same image stabilization technology that powers Canon cameras and lenses also power its binoculars. All binoculars feature an embedded micro-computer that makes necessary adjustments to optical elements inside the binocular housing to account for irregular hand movements caused by unstable or moving platforms.\n\nThe budget and midrange binoculars are equipped with a lens shifting technology that cancels out the effects of shaking by adjusting the position of a correction lens. Canon binoculars in the premium category feature an advanced Vari-Angle system that changes the shape of lens surfaces to produce ultra-smooth images in virtually all situations.\n\nKowa Binoculars\n\nPopular among bird watchers around the world, Kowa is one of the oldest companies to have originated in Japan. Since its inception, the company has blossomed into a multinational organization with engagement in several domains, such as optics, pharmaceutics, textile, IT, machinery equipment, and consumer products. The optics division of the company manufactures a series of products, such as binoculars, spotting scopes, and lenses, as well as digiscoping adapters for smartphones.\n\nHistory\n\nKowa was originally founded as a textile shop in Nagoya, Japan in 1894. The company expanded its textile business by entering into the spinning industry in 1919, but the textile and trading activities in the organization were reorganized in order to establish an individual company called Kowa K.K. It was not until 1946 when it diversified its operations to form Kowa Optical Works.\n\nThe company initially produced eyeglasses but soon transformed its product line-up to produce spotting scopes and binoculars. Some of these devices were brought back to the US by army personnel who were stationed in Japan after the Second World War. Alongside binoculars and scopes, the company produced still six-medium format cameras between 1954 and 1978. Presently governed by 3rd generation of the founders, KOWA employs over 6,500 employees and its products are sold worldwide through a series of stations spread throughout the world.\n\nProduct Line-up\n\nKOWA Optics currently offers the following binoculars:\n\nProminar Genesis XD\n\nGenesis, KOWA’s flagship binoculars, are equipped with four Prominar XD lenses, which are made by the company’s indigenously designed eXtra-low Dispersion glass technology. The premium lenses reduce chromatic aberration significantly and produce unparalleled views with a high contrast ratio.

If you are into observing nature or astronomical objects, you cannot go wrong with the High Lander.\n\nMarket Position\n\nWhat started as a small workshop has since transformed into a multi-national organization with over 6,500 employees. KOWA’s dedication to innovate and decades of optical heritage has led it to becoming the producer of some of the most renowned binoculars in Asia. Although its binoculars were introduced to the US market in the 1950s, it was not until 1980 when the company officially started its operations in North America. Now, KOWA is operating two distribution centers in the US and Germany, which cumulatively sell its products across the Americas and Europe. Since its expansion to international markets, KOWA binoculars have gained a significant market share which is bound to increase thanks to excellent manufacturing practices and feature-filled products at reasonable pricing.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nThe widespread popularity of KOWA binoculars is due to its Prominar XD lenses that are made from pure fluorite crystals with special dispersion properties for virtually zero chromatic aberration. Since nature, especially birds, are an inherently colorful species, a low aberration index allows bird watchers to experience life-like images of birds. Combined with the C3 Prism coating, KOWA binoculars produce amazing images with high-definition colors. Finally, the eyepiece and objective lenses feature the KR dirt-resistant coating for protection against dirt particles and abrasion.\n\nSightron Binoculars\n\nKnown for its riflescopes, Sightron is a Japanese manufacturer of sports optics, which is headquartered in North Carolina, the US with many of its products being produced in Japan.

The imaging systems business of Pentax that produced binoculars was acquired by Ricoh Imaging in 2011, but many of its products, especially binoculars, still carry the popular Pentax label.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally called Asahi Optical Co., Pentax was formed in 1919 as a manufacturer of eyeglasses but soon transformed its business to incorporate projection and camera lenses in the 1930s. The company became a major supplier of lenses for various camera manufacturers before the advent of WW2. It was until 1952 that Pentax rolled out its first SLR camera Asahiflex, which was later followed by a new line of cameras called Pentax. The success of Pentax SLR cameras inspired the company to change its name to become Pentax Corporation in 2002.\n\nThe company produced several variants of DSLR throughout the 2000s, but in 2007 a merger took place between Pentax and Hoya Corporation to form Hoya Pentax HD Corporation. Ricoh, another camera manufacturer, showed interest in acquiring the imaging division of Pentax in 2011. Hoya accepted the offer and Ricoh modified its name after the acquisition to become Ricoh Imaging in 2013. Since the acquisition, all Pentax imaging and sports optics products are manufactured by Ricoh.\n\nProduct Line-up\n\nRicoh Imaging offers the following products in the binoculars line-up:\n\nZ Series\n\nThe Z-series is one of the many premium offerings from Ricoh Imaging that is designed to produce sharp images even in the toughest of situations, whether it is the rough sea, an uneven hiking terrain, a rainy forest, or a windy countryside.

A series is available in both roof and Porro prism design. The roof prism variant features an open-bridge hinge and pocket models are equipped with a double-hinge mechanism for easy storage.\n\nThe A series binos with roof prisms are available in 9×32, 8×36, 10×36, 9×28, 8×25, and 10×25 models and Porro prism models come in 8×30 and 10×30 configurations.\n\nPapilio II\n\nWhen portability is of utmost importance without losing performance, these minuscule binoculars from Ricoh come to the rescue. Able to focus from 50 cm up to infinity, the Papilio II binoculars are fitted with notable features, such as multi-coated aspherical lenses, Porro prisms, rubber armor, and long eye relief.\n\nTwo models of Papilio are available: 6.5×21 and 8.5×21.\n\nV Series\n\nThe V series is one-of-a-kind innovation in the field of optics that incorporates three different functionalities in one device: 4×20 binoculars, two separate monoculars when detached, and a telescope when connected in series. Apart from its interesting design, the compact device produces good-quality images and comprises dielectric multi-coated lenses, phase-corrected roof prisms, an individual focus mechanism, and JIS 7 grade Nitrogen-waterproof housing.\n\nMarket Position\n\nAccording to a recent survey, Pentax has kept a modest 3.1% share in the Japanese consumer electronics market. The imaging section of the company has manufactured innovative mirror-less, DSLR, SLR, and compact cameras throughout the years, which has directly accelerated the growth of its sports optics line. Ever since the merger with Hoya Corporation and subsequent acquisition by Ricoh Imaging, the company has seen an increase in the demand for its binoculars. To further expand the market share, Ricoh is keen to introduce state-of-the-art features in its product line up, one example of which is the modular V series binoculars.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nDue to increased sales, more people are getting to know about the advanced manufacturing processes and quality standards at Ricoh Imaging. The company recently introduced a three-in-one device, which triples as binoculars, two monoculars, and a telescope. The new product has gained significant traction among people who like to carry a compact set of binoculars everywhere. Additionally, the U series zoom binoculars are a perfect device for those looking for multiple magnifications in one device. Innovations like these have pushed Pentax binoculars back into the limelight and further growth of the brand is inevitable.\n\nOEM PRODUCERS FOR SEVERAL POPULAR BRANDS\n\nContinuous innovation and technologically advanced manufacturing processes known to man is one of the reasons why Japan rose to prominence in the aftermath of WW2. Presently, Japan is home to numerous production facilities that produce binoculars for several brands from around the world, such as Vortex, Athlon, Bushnell, and Kahles to name a few. The renowned brands have chosen Japan because of the ultimate combination of cheaper production costs and a long heritage of producing high-quality consumer products. The outsourcing model helps these brands keep the product price low while maintaining profit margins, therefore more and more people can harness the power of premium binoculars.\n\nCONCLUSION"
