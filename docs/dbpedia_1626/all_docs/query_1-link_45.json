        "text": "Robalero1 says:\n\nLet me say I am on the verge of purchasing one of these lenses. Love the reviews, but there have been some which cause concern. I've been reading reviews from several persons from several sites reviewing this lens and a couple have said that their lens was made in China. Anyone else experience this? If so, are there any differences? Is there anyway to guarantee that the lens you are purchasing is made in Japan?\n\n4:38AM, 25 April 2012 PDT\n\nfishandsnap says:\n\nGeez, who cares where it is made providing it works.\n\nUnfortunately made in Japan is just another badge of honour to help folks find their level on the internet photographer pyramid.\n\nHardy fly rods, how british do you want to get, are now made in Asia, quality is the same, price is higher due to the shortage of carbon cloth .......\n\nages ago\n\ngrey bikes [deleted] says:\n\nI'v had mine for a few years it's made in china and it is stunning I have owned all versions of the Nikon 105 macro lenses all the 55s and the 60mm I love them all but the VR is the best I\"v used\n\nI even had a Conan 100mm Tamron 90mm and Pentax 100mm\n\nages ago\n\nlooperp55 says:\n\nMine is made in Japan. The lens used to get the highest ratings in reviews but recently, and maybe since the change of location, it seems to get poorer reviews with problems not heard of in the original reviews. Have reviews got tougher and more comprehensive or has the quality gone down slightly or are there more variations in the lenses? I do not know but I am very happy with my lens.\n\nages ago\n\nEd Lee Foto says:\n\nI got Leica X Vario which is made in Germany. And I have Sony RX1 and it's made in Japan with German Zeiss lens. Both nations reputable with machine/glass. Personally speaking I like the Japan/German combo. But, that's me.\n\nBTW, I'm selling X Vario. It's unusable to me.\n\nI was looking into 105 macro and the model at store is Made in China. I don't want to do nation bashing...but, I didn't buy it.\n\nIf I offended anyone it wasn't my intention.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nEd Lee Foto edited this topic ages ago.\n\njlmfalves says:\n\nI'm from Portugal but now I live and work in China and there are no way to scape from this fact, Nikon like other multinational enterprises moves the construction of many lens and cameras to their factory here in China. I have already several lens from here and all of them work perfectly. So i think this discussion as no mean because is we want some product that they decide to built in China you have to buy it or....no product at all!!!\n\nAlso I recommend this site www.pocket-lint.com/news/112485-nikon-1-factory-tour-china\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\njlmfalves edited this topic ages ago.\n\nShinglens says:\n\nI care. Even if the lenses are identical in terms of performance, I care. The Japanese adhere to higher environmental standards and treat their workers better than the Chinese. They are also not an authoritarian one-party government, so I don't mind supporting them.\n\nI just got mine from KEH and, as I expected, it's a Chinese version. I'll live. I'd have been happier if a Japanese version had shown up, though.\n\nMy confidence in Japanese manufacturing is also higher, though I fully realize that China has made great strides in manufacturing. Assuming this lens works as advertised -- I literally just opened it up -- I would still have more faith that a Japanese product would be more reliable and last longer.\n\nSo, yeah, it does matter to me, and most especially at the same price point.\n\nages ago\n\nEd Lee Foto says:\n\nShinglens:I care too. But, that's just me. I also expect highest standard especially when paying over one grand plus. I like pre 2008 lenses. I just prefer it. It has modern aspect and still has Nikon look & feel. The later lenses seem to have lost that magic and became generic to me. Whether because of outsourcing to Thailand or China I don't know. I own 70-200 VR I, 14-24, 24-70 for Nikon.\n\nages ago\n\nweizhang.wsu@gmail.com says:\n\nI compared the two versions yesterday in a local camera shop, found that the China made version is slightly sharper shooting wide open (shot some pics with my Nikon D610). I'm not sure if the Japan made one I used is a bad copy or not. The sharpness different is very slight though. I also noticed by accidentally looking at the rear element (I'm not a lens perv... lol), the China made one had greener coating and the Japan made one had more purple coating. Which means Nikon modified the formula, right?\n\nages ago\n\nSEWinds says:\n\nFor sure though likely separated by time of manufacture. It's an active science/technology where improvements yield reduced reflections usually in bands of frequencies with the other frequencies (color casts) reflected somewhat. I suspect cost and lens curvature/reflections might yield collections of different coatings on a given lens (exclusive of Nano coating) but I don't know this for sure.\n\nSomeday they will all be perfect. Some early multi coated lenses shifted away from bluish casts (sort of green) to better favor films selectivity to blue light. Makes me wonder if they might try to notch such reflection colors to occur between the colors used by the sensors.\n\nInteresting topic...\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nSEWinds edited this topic ages ago.\n\njwbaits says:\n\nI too care. I was in the market for a 105 macro and looked at at least 12 of them at three different retailers in 2015. I did not buy any of them. Checking the inner glass, they all had many, many air bubbles scattered all over. I simply refuse to lay my good money down for what I expect to be top glass from Nikon that turns out to be inferior product. I eventually found a used Japanese one which only had three or four barely visible bubbles around the outside rim of the glass. I read or heard that the Chinese made lenses are prone to lots of air bubbles in the glass. I wrote to Nikon about what I consider a serious degradation of their quality control and they replied with \"We're sorry to hear that\".\n\n97 months ago"
