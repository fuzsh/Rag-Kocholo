        "text": "Short history of\n\nNikon Corporation™\n\nIn the beginning......\n\nEmperor Mutsuhito**\n\nDespite its presence in all continents and the 2004 announced Consumer Relations Management, Nikon's HQ in Tokyo remain almost - due to the inscrutable Japanese communication culture - inaccessible for most foreigners. Although decisions are entirely made in Tokyo, foreign journalists are asked to contact Nikon's representations in their respective countries! And when visiting the main (global) website (www.nikon.com, without a contact button!) in Japan it will automatically refer you to the representation in your country. But on that global website - however - Nikon increasingly has put comprehensive information about its history and its products.\n\nNikon Corporation's HQ\n\nSince late November 2014 Nikon Corporation's head office - and all main departments and affiliated companies - are located in the 32-storeyed, 140 meters high, Shinagawa Intercity Tower C in Tokyo (see below).\n\nFor more information please visit the company’s web site\n\nNikon Museum\n\nOn October 17, 2015 Nikon Corporation opened a very nice museum, in Tower C (see above map), in which \"you will see how Nikon has progressed to what it is today\".\n\nLocation: Shinagawa Intercity Tower C, 2F, 2-15-3, Konan, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-6290, Japan\n\nAccess 7 min. walk from the Konan Exit of JR Shinagawa Station\n\n10 min. walk from Keikyu Shinagawa Station\n\nOpening hours 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. (last admission at 5:30 p.m.)\n\nClosed Sundays, Japanese national holidays, and other days determined by the Museum\n\nAdmission Free\n\nContact TEL: +81-3-6433-3900 FAX: +81-3-6433-3901\n\nSee for more information the Nikon Museum website.\n\nApart from photographic equipment Nikon Corporation is one of the world's leading producers of so-called steppers. In 1980 Nikon Corporation introduced the world's first production-worthy step-and-repeat photolithography tool for semiconductor fabrication. With a stepper it is possible to reduce integrated circuits down to microscopic sizes via a complex process called photolithography, enabling to manufacture chips for computer processors, memory sticks, etc.\n\nIn its conference on May 14, 2015 Nikon Corporation presented its Medium Term Management Plan under the slogan \"Next 100 - Transformation to Grow\". It is striving 'to be a corporate entity having 6-business portfolio for sustainable growth'. Those 6 businesses are lithography, imaging products, semiconductors, microscopes, industrial metrology and medical business. Unfortunately in that plan nothing is mentioned about public relations or about the above mentioned consumer relations management.\n\nQuality control........\n\nManufacturing with clockwork precision and with minimal tolerance, based on intelligent engineering and artistic design, may be a prerequisite to produce high-end cameras and lenses, but quality control always remains an important factor in a production process. Nikon Corporation has a reputation of employing inexorable inspectors who are testing each product tenaciously. In addition to that Japan has - since 1954 - created an institute which is unique in its kind:\n\nJapan (Nippon) Camera and optical instruments Inspection and testing Institute, famous for its golden JCII sticker (see above) on many cameras, lenses and other photographic gear. It was formed to inspect all cameras exported from Japan in order to maintain quality standards. It is said that when of one production run of 300 cameras 5 or more cameras did not meet the minimum requirements of the JCII the whole party was sent back to the manufacturer! In 1969 JCII was re-named Japan Camera Industry Institute and started to preserve 'Historical Japanese Cameras'. A very interesting collection of these historic cameras and many proto-types are shown in the JCII museum in downtown Tokyo, open to the public since 1989. The museum has also a 'Photo Salon' and a large library.\n\nDisasters\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is located in an area where several continental and oceanic plates meet. This is the cause of frequent earthquakes and the presence of many volcanoes and hot springs across Japan. If earthquakes occur below or close to the ocean, they may trigger tidal waves (tsunami). Nearly every month an area in or around Japan is hit by an earthquake. Some earthquakes were devastating, hitting also Nippon Kogaku alias Nikon Corporation. The Great Kanto earthquake in September 1923 with a death toll of over 100,000 destroyed a large part of the premises of Nippon Kogaku. Also the Hanshin earthquake hitting Kobe in January 1995 caused a lot of damage. The Great East Japan Earthquake - as the Thohoku earthquake of March 2011 is called by Nikon Corporation - that mainly hit the Sendai region with a death toll of over 24,000, was devastating for Japan's industry and infra-structure, too. By the end of March 2011 Nikon Corporation reinstated all its factories, running to a total damage of 2,313 million Yen. Not all production facilities were fully operational, and some supply companies were not able to operate at full power.\n\nJust after these problems were solved Nikon Corporation (and others unfortunately) was hit by the devastating flooding in Thailand mid 2011. Operations (stopped per October 6) resumed from January 2012. Suppliers of parts for Nikon photographic products were affected by the series of earthquakes mid April 2016 in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. In 2020 Nikon was also hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, hampering production and supply chains seriously.\n\nAn interesting book has been written by the Dutch journalist and professor Karel van Wolferen, titled 'The Enigma of Japanese Power' in 1989. (ISBN 90-6766100-7), which has been translated into twelve languages and is generally considered to provide the most elaborate intellectual support of what has been called the \"revisionist\" view of Japan. His analysis is well-known and appreciated among the most prominent reformist politicians of Japan. He has gained a large Japanese readership with some sixteen books (with a total of well over one million copies sold), on political, economical and historical issues relating to Japan as well as on problems of political change and global compatibility among economic systems.\n\nBack to top"
