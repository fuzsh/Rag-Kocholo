        "text": "Has anyone tried the Helios Aquila ? I've seen a claim that they are as good as the SEs optically but I have no idea how true it is. (I very much doubt that the build quality is up to SE standards, but they are a lot cheaper).\n\nI tried the 8.5x42 briefly. They are excellent in the centre but have a small sweetspot. I believe that people have compared the centre performance with the SE but the edge performance drops off drastically. I found the edges very distracting.\n\nMechanically, they seemed well made and I imagine they would last you a long time and be unlikely to fail. The bridge was very sturdy with no wobble that affected the focus performance.\n\nThe eye-relief was too short for me that was they main reason I wouldn't buy them. Even if the e/r had been ok I may not have bought them because of the edge performance. Hard to tell if the e/r does not allow you to see the whole view at once.\n\nIf you don't mind poor edges and the e/r works for you, you may well like them.\n\nIt's not at all impossible to do this. 40 years ago Kern made a 42mm Porro with an internal focusing element and a wide true FOV. The Kern 6x42 Focalpin had a TFOV of 8.3*. An 8x42 version using the same size eyepiece fieldstop could have done and would have had the same FOV.\n\nOops! Somehow I missed your post, Henry. Looks like I did have reason to be suspicious about the aforementioned \"I suspect...\" post.\n\nIt's good to hear that internal focus WF porros are possible, but it makes it even more puzzling why optics companies didn't introduce this \"evolution\" while high quality CF porros still roamed the earth.\n\nIf they had, perhaps an internal focus porro wouldn't have been displaced by roofs, and birders wouldn't be paying through the proboscis for a roof that's comparable to what less-expensive-to-make porros could have been with updated coatings/glass and internal focusers.\n\nThe Cascades were dirt cheap, and even Minox eventually lowered their price on the 8x and 10x44 BPs after they realized that despite the German name, they couldn't bilk buyers out of $599 for a 6.4* 8x or a 5.1* 10x \"Made in Japan\" porro).\n\nWere the Kerns expensive to make? Or did they have IF EPs?\n\nThere must be some reason why manufacturers didn't pursue this innovation with porros, but instead starting working on perfecting the roof design for the past 30 years.\n\nThanks for that info and diagram, Henry. I can see the focuser bridge at the bottom, but in this \"x-ray view\" I'm not sure where the focuser is located, on top or at the bottom like the Swaro SLs. There seems to be a shaft in the center going from top to bottom but I can't tell from the diagram if that's functional or just infrastructure.\n\nAs far as pricing, an internal focus Leica porro made today is going to be as expensive as a Leica roof (although roofs weren't nearly as good optically as porros 40 years ago due to the lack of p-/sliver/dielectric coatings, so I'm surprised you were disappointed at the Kern porro's performance).\n\nIf the unthinkable happened, and Leica, Zeiss, and Swaro started making high quality porros with internal focusers, they would no doubt be very pricey even though the \"buzz\" is that porros are easier to manufacturer (and the examples I gave of the two recent internal focus porros seem to support that as do the low price of porros today).\n\nThe more complex, wider FOV EPs would add some cost. Although curiously, you once said that the Zeiss FL didn't have complex EPs, and I meant to ask you about that reference since it contradicts what you wrote in my \"Incremental Change$\" thread about alpha's complex EPs being one factor in alpha's high cost).\n\nYou also pay for the quality parts and engineering when you buy a German- or Austrian-made roof.\n\nHowever, a goodly chunk of the costs involved are due to the high cost of labor in those countries and therefore also the high cost of materials. A Swaro rep admitted this to me so this is not my personal \"speculation\".\n\nAnd it's no secret revelation, you can easily find references (and I've posted them on BF before) about Germany having the highest wages and highest cost of living in Europe, and Austria being the second in those categories. Those costs get passed on to the consumer.\n\nHowever, I bet your buttons that if a Japanese or a Chinese bin manufacturer made an internal focuser porro with WF EPs, it wouldn't cost $2K (or at least it wouldn't need to cost $2K).\n\nSo cost is not the prohibitive factor in making good quality internal focuser porros with WF EPs. It can be done at competitive prices to alpha roofs.\n\nBut as John said above, porros were displaced due to roof's compactness and ergonomics. I would add to that the invention of p-coatings, which enabled roofs to come up to par, or nearly, with good quality porros.\n\nThat was the turning point and the beginning of the \"heavy bombardment period\" for porrosaurs.\n\nUntil optics manufacturers started making open bridge roofs, their compactness and ergonomics didn't have any appeal to me, because of my large hands.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only male birder with large hands, and I can't imagine that women drove the trend toward roofs. There are a lot of couples that bird together, but not nearly as many women hunters, and w/out broaching that subject again 'ere we should get off track with another moral discussion, most bins aimed at hunters are also roofs.\n\nThere may have been other factors that drove the Cambrian Roof Explosion besides p-coatings and women's and small handed men's preferences for compact design bin. Roof's superior waterproofness is undoubtedly one of those factors.\n\nBut what about the \"roof mystique\" that Stephen Ingraham and other reviewers have alluded to? How much of role did that factor play in marketing roofs, and where did this \"mystique\" originate and what exactly is it???\n\nmystique = An aura of heightened value, interest, or meaning surrounding something, arising from attitudes and beliefs that impute special power or mystery to it.\n\nI have some ideas about this, but I probably already lost Henry with my long post, and I know I lost Steve (mooreorless) after the first paragraph!\n\nSo e will probe the dark depths of that mystery another time, but I think solving that mystery might be the key to finding how to create a marketing \"mystique\" for internal focus porros."
