        "text": "Lemon is popular for its range of preloved film and digital cameras, lenses and equipment, all of which are in great condition. It’s especially well-known among fans of Leica, as there are many models on sale and the store even has a dedicated Leica repair service. Aside from cameras, you’ll also find used camera bags and carriers as well as tripods and the odd GoPro.\n\nPhotography purists might want to make a beeline for the corner dedicated to film and instant cameras. Here, you’ll find colour as well as black-and-white film rolls, plus fun single-use cameras. The shop also has a few defective camera models which are sold at a steep discount. These are a great bargain if you’re interested in fixing up a camera yourself.\n\nIf you’re looking to sell instead, you can also bring in your camera and equipment to be evaluated. Lemon has a couple other locations around Tokyo, including outposts in Akihabara and Ginza.\n\nThis gorgeous camera emporium looks almost like a museum, housing six floors of camera and photography-related goods. Perfect for all levels of photographers, whether beginner, casual or pro, this Kitamura flagship in Shinjuku offers new and used equipment as well as the largest selection of film cameras out of all the Kitamura stores.\n\nThe first floor is dedicated to instant cameras alongside a range of stylish camera straps and other fun accessories. Avid collectors should stop by the sixth floor salon for Leica and vintage camera models. You can even get your film developed and printed at the shop, too.\n\nDon't speak Japanese? No worries. Kitamura has English-speaking staff to help you with your enquiries, purchase and repair.\n\nA long-standing camera shop near Nakano Station, Fujiya Camera offers a comprehensive selection of new and second-hand cameras, lenses and accessories. The shop was founded over 70 years ago and is loved by photographers as it carries a wealth of stock including over 2,000 second-hand items ranging from recent to classic and vintage goods. Plus, Fujiya’s friendly staff are on hand to guide and advise all photography enthusiasts, even beginners.\n\nThe expansive camera store covers four floors across two buildings. The main building carries new and used cameras from the likes of Nikon, Canon and Leica. Head across the street to the second shop for all your video camera needs as well as photography accessories, equipment and more.\n\nFujiya also has an online store should you prefer to shop from the comfort of your home.\n\nThis massive store comprises five floors of cameras as well as photography equipment and accessories. While Map Camera carries both new and used equipment, the second-hand items here are particularly well-kept and in pristine condition. Aside from the Leica boutique on the first floor, there's also a basement dedicated to the renowned German brand, offering a considerable selection of Leica models, rangefinder cameras, lenses and more.\n\nLooking for an upgrade? You can bring in your old cameras and equipment to sell or trade. For trade-ins, your items will be first evaluated by the staff, then you can browse the shopping floors to find yourself something new. Don't forget to bring your passport or residence card for the trade-in service.\n\nIf you’ve ever shopped for electronics in Japan, you’ve probably heard of Yodobashi Camera. The all-encompassing flagship store in Shinjuku comprises nine sections, including one of the best camera shops in the city.\n\nHighly recommended by our very own Time Out photographers, Yodobashi’s dedicated camera pavilion takes up an entire building with the first two floors stocking the latest DSLRs, digital cameras, lenses and more. Floors three to five offer a plethora of camera-related equipment, such as carrier bags, tripods, lighting accessories and the like. The stairwell between floors showcases photographs taken by staff members, and you’ll be able to find out the cameras and equipment they used to capture that shot.\n\nFor film enthusiasts, Yodobashi has another building dedicated to your interests. Here you’ll find all the accessories and equipment you need to set up your own darkroom. You can get your photos developed and printed at the store, and there’s repair service here, too.\n\nWhat’s more, the staff are very knowledgeable and are able to help you with your needs. Some of them also speak English and Chinese, so you’ll be in good hands."
