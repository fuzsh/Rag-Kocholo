        "text": "Nikon began as Nippon Kogaku K.K. (Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd.) on July 25, 1917, at 120 Haramachi, Koishikawa-ku (present-day Hakusan 4-chome, Bunkyo-ku) in Tokyo, starting domestic production of optical instruments such as rangefinders and microscopes. This was the first of Nikon's many steps that now span a century.\n\nDuring that era, the production of advanced optical instruments was a matter of national urgency for Japan. Entrusted with this objective was Koyata Iwasaki, the president of the Mitsubishi and nephew of Mitsubishi founder Yataro Iwasaki.\n\nHence, plans were made to establish an optics company by combining the optical instruments division of the Tokyo Keiki company and the mirror division of Iwaki Glass with Fujii Lens Manufacturing. This merger gave rise to Nippon Kogaku K.K. and, subsequently, the Nikon of today.\n\nWith advances in optical technologies, eight engineers were invited by the company from Germany in 1921. These specialists included Professor Max Lange, who was a world authority on lens design, Heinrich Acht, who had rich experience in microscope design, Ernst Bernick, a leader in precision instrument technology, and Hermann Dillmann, a specialist in lens design and computation. The guidance of these engineers had a dramatic effect on improving the company's technologies.\n\nThey also initiated design for development of Nikon's photographic lenses. To catch up with the level of optical technologies of developed countries, the company started out by imitating, and named its series of lenses \"Anytar,\" which were designed following the example of the Tessar lens that was the main lens type at the time. Heinrich Acht, who was the director of the mathematics section of the design department was placed in charge of the Anytar lens designs. It is said that Acht had a hand in almost all of the Anytar lens designs.\n\nThe Japanese designers made improvements after Acht returned to Germany. The Anytar 12cm F4.5 prototype was initially completed in 1929. It was then further modified, and by 1931 reached a level where it was no longer standing in the shadow of the original Tessar. It is recognized that there have been seven types of the Anytar lens, with focal lengths of 7.5cm, 10.5cm, 10.7cm, 12cm, 15cm, 18cm and 36cm.\n\nIn September 1923, the company's glass research facilities were damaged in the Great Kanto Earthquake and their operations had to be suspended. Recovery was completed by February of 1924, and glass research was then resumed. By March of 1927, 70 major melts and 220 trial melts had taken place. The purpose of these efforts was solely to improve glass quality and establish mass-production technology.\n\nMeanwhile, for basic research, the company also set up an analysis laboratory in its Oi Dai-ni plant to determine basic specifications for glass materials and perform analysis on glass and crucible clays. Research into precision glass annealing was also begun, with a furnace built in the corner of a hallway to measure changes in test glass distortion. The first attempt made was to anneal a 20cm-diameter objective lens for a large binocular telescope and in 1927 successful annealing of glass for rangefinder pentaprisms was achieved. Through such research and much hand work, the company became able to manufacture optical glass of a quality equal to that made outside of Japan.\n\nIn 1931, an 8-inch astronomical telescope was installed in the roof observatory dome on the newly completed Ueno wing of the Tokyo Science Museum. This was known as the 20cm equatorial refracting telescope and was the first full-fledged model of its kind to be produced in Japan. It boasted the largest caliber compared to other Japanese-made telescopes of the time. The device underwent major modifications in 1954 and continued to convey the fascination of the heavens to visitors for a total of over 70 years, the longest ever in Japan, until 2005. The telescope is now on permanent display in a zone called the Exploring the Universe located on basement level 3 of the Global Gallery at the National Museum of Nature and Science.\n\nNIKKOR lenses were born of the strong desire of Japanese designers to domestically produce photographic lenses, for which the nation had up till that point been reliant on other countries. Designers went to Europe to observe its optical industry, and devoted their time to gathering information on photographic lenses, visiting camera store after camera store in Berlin. Finally, after obtaining samples, the designers returned to Japan, which is when the real struggle began.\n\nAlthough modern computers can now be relied upon, lens design involves various complex calculations. Even painstakingly produced prototypes might not provide the expected image quality when used to shoot photographs, and compared to the current era, there were far fewer types of glass available for lenses. The company engaged in research by means of disassembly, measurement and assembly experiments following precision aberration measurement testing.\n\nAfter these exercises in trial and error, the company produced its first lens in 1929, the Anytar 12cm F4.5. Then followed the successful development of a range of lens models, while considering a brand name for these products, as there were now definite prospects for photographic lens manufacture. Hence, combining the \"NIKKO\" abbreviation of the \"Nippon Kougaku\" company name with the letter \"R\" often used as a suffix for photographic lens names at the time, the company settled upon the NIKKOR brand name. This name was registered as a trademark in 1932.\n\nLess than two years after the completion of blueprints in September of 1946, the first Nikon camera, the Nikon Model I, was launched in March of 1948. This camera contained original inventions such as small radial ball bearings used for the shutter release, and was the result of overcoming many tough challenges, from research through to marketing.\n\nThe Nikon Model I was highly anticipated after being advertised in magazines and via other channels before its release. At the time, supply could not keep up with the strong demand for domestically produced cameras, but the real battle began the moment the camera went on sale. Designers had to field complaint after complaint, and find effective solutions on a daily basis. Nevertheless, they overcame issues one by one and made improvements leading to the Nikon M model of 1949 and the Nikon S of 1950. After that, the camera continued to evolve into the S2, SP, and to the single-lens reflex Nikon F. Nikon cameras advanced continually until their robustness and sophistication went on to attract renown, making Nikon a global brand.\n\nOn December 10, 1950, the New York Times published a special article commending the excellence of Nikon cameras and NIKKOR lenses. This was based on high acclaim by LIFE magazine photographers who had traveled to the Korean War battlefields. On the bitterly cold Korean Peninsula, while other cameras were frozen and unusable, Nikon's worked well and recorded how the severe battles were fought.\n\nThe New York Times article reported that, \"NIKKOR lenses are extremely precise, with high efficiency, and better than German lenses\" and \"Previous Japanese cameras had only beautiful exteriors, while internal performance was inferior, however, this Nikon camera is intricate and provides beautiful results.\"\n\nBecause of this, NIKKOR lenses which were equal to German lenses pre-war, achieved the world's highest class and completely renewed the image of \"Made In Japan\" which had previously been \"cheap and bad quality\". As a technology-intensive nation, Japan started here.\n\nThe signature and legendary Nikon SP was a ship of rangefinder cameras made in Japan.\n\nThe most important feature of this camera, a built-in universal viewfinder that supports six interchangeable lenses (focal lengths 2.8, 3.5, 5, 8.5, 10.5, 13.5cm) was highly acclaimed by professional photographers. These cameras were prized for their whisper-quiet curtain shutters, rear curtain accelerator and silent braking to absorb shock (with coiled axial clamping), as they were designed to produce extremely low operating noise and shock. These technologies began to develop into a system camera with a motor drive unit (capable of 3 frames per second), finder frame illumination for dark locations, and a flash sync connection in the accessory shoe, all directly connectable without a cord. Nikon's first self-timer was also built in.\n\nThe Nikon SP, together with the NIKKOR lens and optical glass, won the grand prix at the 1958 World Expo held in Brussels.\n\nBringing together Nikon's optical and precision technology, the Nikon F drew a major reaction from around the world, and was in production for 15 years up to 1973, effectively solidifying the Nikon and NIKKOR brands.\n\nNewly developed were main components such as the mirror box, pentaprism and bayonet, while the rest could be said to be the same as the SP. However, major technical hurdles had to be surmounted in developing the mirror box and pentaprism mechanism, such as the need for the mirror and lens aperture to automatically return to the wide-open state instantly after shooting.\n\nThe bayonet mount was made of stainless steel to sufficiently withstand the weight of a telephoto lens. Looking ahead to the future, a 44mmø (34mmø for the Nikon S) internal diameter was also adopted to enable use of larger aperture lenses. This was the \"Nikon F mount\" which is also used with new digital single-lens reflex cameras – a technology that has been handed down for more than half a century. This system is the world's longest used lens mount originally designed for 35mm SLR cameras.\n\nThe Nikon F takes full advantage of the SLR characteristic of being able to actually project onto the film what the user sees in the viewfinder by making the finder's field of view 100%. Titanium (0.02mm thick) was adopted for the shutter curtain. In addition to shutter speed, a complete coupling system combining aperture with the Nikon exposure meter was achieved.\n\nAfter the war, Japan had deployed an American micro-file system for saving bulk documentation on microfilm, but because many more strokes are required for writing Japanese characters than the alphabet, the lens resolution of the system was insufficient. Hence, the company developed the high-resolution \"Micro-NIKKOR\" lens in 1956, which resulted in a flood of inquiries from printing companies and electronics manufacturers about high-resolution lenses. There were also demands for higher-resolution lenses to be used for creating the printed circuit boards required for the manufacture of electronic components.\n\nThus, in August of 1962, the Ultra Micro-NIKKOR was developed. Two years later, the company succeeded in developing a lens boasting the highest resolution of any in the world. With this resolution it was possible to distinguish some 1,260 paired black and white stripes per millimeter. A 330-page English novel was successfully compressed onto a microfilm just 12.6 x 13.2mm in size – the Ultra Micro-NIKKOR took both the Japanese and global markets by storm.\n\nSubsequently, the technological legacy of the Ultra Micro-NIKKOR would be inherited as the core technology of semiconductor lithography systems, which would be called \"the most precise machinery in history.\"\n\nIn January 1971, Nikon agreed a contract in response to a request from the American National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA). This was to supply cameras to record the Apollo 15 mission to the lunar surface to be launched that year, and for the Apollo 17 mission planned for the following year. The 1968 Nikon Photomic FT Nwas selected as the base for the development.\n\nNASA had designated specifications to ensure that these cameras would function correctly in the extreme environments of space. These included use of NASA-specified materials such as lubricants and high shock absorption characteristics, and to prevent possible problems due to the reflection of sunlight, the exterior of the devices were to be matte black. 55mm F1.2 lenses were mounted, also finished in matte black. By June, all of these criteria had been satisfied and the company supplied NASA with nine cameras. These products were headed for the moon the following month with the launch of Apollo 15. The NASA-specification Nikon Photomic FT Nwas also later adopted as a special camera system used in Skylab, a mission during in which three astronauts lived in space over a prolonged period. The cameras were designed to photograph the Earth's ozone layer and Auroras.\n\nED Glass is a special glass designed to compensate for chromatic aberration and achieve clearer images.\n\nCompensating for chromatic aberration of the lens usually entails correcting the focal points of two different wavelengths so that they match. However, with telephoto lenses in particular, there are more than two wavelengths involved which means the amount of focal deviation (secondary spectrum) is larger and there is more chromatic aberration which degrades image quality.\n\nLow-dispersion glass was shown to be effective in solving this problem, so the company began its manufacture. In December 1971, the company developed a new type of optical glass called PC102 ED Glass. Taking the lead over other companies, Nikon achieved upsizing and mass production with a continuous melting process.\n\nIn January 1972, the company released the NIKKOR-H 300mm F2.8 aimed at the press, which was used to shoot various competitions at the Sapporo Olympics. PC 102 improved lens performance and was adopted for the 300mm and longer telephoto and zoom F-mount lenses, although it missed the initial production of this lens.\n\nBeginning with interchangeable lenses, ED glass is currently also utilized for binoculars, Fieldscopes and a derivative glass is employed for semiconductor lithography projection lenses. To put it simply, this material has become indispensable to Nikon products.\n\nA ruling engine refers to a diffraction grating ruling machine, and is a device for manufacturing diffraction gratings.\n\nIn 1964, Nikon completed Ruling Engine No. 1, the first domestically produced ruling engine as a part of Ministry of Education projects (currently the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology). However, the device was not practical due to accuracy and stability issues. Even later in the 1960s, the ruling engine was considered more of a theoretical \"fantasy machine\" than a reality in Japan.\n\nAround this time, Nikon was considering new business with spectroscopic analysis machines. Diffraction gratings are key parts of spectrum analyzers. They are optical components that consist of fine structures on glass or mirrors to provide spectra from the interference of light diffracted as it passes through the grating. The company became aware of the need for the ruling engine.\n\nNikon began developing its second ruling engine in 1967. While basic parts were outsourced due to budgetary and time considerations, Nikon moved ahead with the development of a control system for the glass substrate stage and its laser interferometer. Nikon also worked on various developments such as diamond cutter polishing technologies and replica production technology for mass production of diffraction gratings. Ruling Engine No. 2 was completed in 1971, and Nikon began mass production of the 2-inch square diffraction gratings to be mounted in the \"Nikon monochromator G-250\" spectrum analyzer. Thus, the \"fantasy machine\" had finally become a reality.\n\nThe achievement of Ruling Engine No. 2 gave Nikon a big boost toward developing semiconductor lithography systems.\n\nNaomi Uemura was one of Japan's leading adventurers. Among his many accomplishments, he was the first Japanese to reach the summit of Everest, first in the world to climb the highest peaks on five continents, circumnavigate the Arctic Circle and reach the North Pole solo by dog sled, for which he was awarded the People's Honor Award in 1984.\n\nOn arriving in Alaska on his 12,000-km solo dog sled trip around the Arctic Circle in May 1976, Uemura was greeted by news photographers. Nearly all the cameras pointed at Uemura were Nikons. In such a harsh environment many other brands of cameras failed and were not able to record the moment.\n\nIn June 1977, Uemura expressed his desire to Nikon for a camera to take on his solo dog sled trip to the North Pole. Such a camera would have to withstand heavy shock and the extremely low polar temperatures. For this reason, the drive system was lubricated with special cold-resistant oil, and the shutter speed was adjusted to function properly in temperatures around minus 50Â°C. The camera was retrofit with titanium for the top, bottom, penta and front cover parts. At the time, Nikon was the only company able to manufacture titanium camera parts. A prototype was put in the trunk Uemura used on his dog sled, and tested for shock by rolling it down some stairs at the company's Oi plant.\n\nThis resulted in the world's first titanium-exterior SLR camera in December 1977, called the Nikon F2 Titanium Uemura Special, of which three units were completed. The following year, Uemura headed across Greenland on his solo dog sled trek toward the North Pole with two cameras, and shot 180 rolls of film of the six month adventure.\n\nIn 1982, the Nikon F3 Titanium Uemura Special, based on the Nikon F3, was manufactured for his 3,000-km Antarctic dog sled trek and scaling of the Vinson Massif, the highest peak on the Antarctic continent. But due to the Falklands war in March of that year the trip was canceled and the cameras were not used on an expedition.\n\n(With the cooperation of the Uemura Museum Tokyo and Uemura Naomi Memorial Museum)\n\nAs a flagship model, the latest electronic technologies of the day were adopted for the Nikon F3. This was the first camera to offer electronic shutter control and an aperture-priority auto-exposure control mechanism. The F3 also featured new functions like an LCD viewfinder display, a TTL sensor positioned at the bottom of the camera mirror box, and Speedlight TTL flash control. The F3 was not equipped with a motor drive, but the optional motor drive was designed to work as an integral part of the camera body to achieve shooting at up to 6 fps. Both the camera and motor drive were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italy. He designed the two to appear as one when the motor drive was attached to the camera. Giugiaro's fresh design pursued a simple form featuring a raised grip on the camera body, and an eye-catching red line. These design elements had a great impact on later camera designs.\n\nIn 1976, the VLSI Technology Research Association (VLSI Labs) was promoted under the guidance of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (currently The Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry). The research association asked Nikon to develop a stepper to allow circuit pattern sizes to be reduced to one-tenth of what they were.\n\nKey to this stepper would be a projection lens capable of high-precision resolution, and a high-precision, high-speed moving stage for positioning. The issue with an ultra-precise, high-speed stage is getting it to move straight. The device developed by Nikon was accurate enough to hit a tennis ball with an arrow on the top of Mt. Fuji all the way from Tokyo. Lastly, photo-electric sensors for converting light into electrical signals were needed. Nikon achieved all of these core technologies.\n\nIn March of 1978, the first prototype was delivered to the research association, followed by prototype 2. Both were highly acclaimed.\n\nIn February 1980, the NSR-1010G stepper was announced, the first domestically produced commercial device. This machine boasted one micrometer resolution and high overlay accuracy (alignment), and garnered a lot of attention for its promise in VLSI manufacture.\n\nComputer Numerical Control (CNC) image measurement systems use the image-processing technologies of computers and optical measurement technologies to measure and inspect the dimensions and shapes of workpieces, including precision devices and electronic components.\n\nAs electronic and automotive parts became more detailed and precise, the need for non-contact optical measurement systems to measure component surfaces without touching them was ever-more pressing. Furthermore, as automation in manufacturing became more prevalent, strong demand for automated, high-speed mass measurement industrial inspection processes emerged. To meet these demands, the company developed the Nikon EXcellent Intelligent Vision system (NEXIV) based on the concept of automating the vision and judgment of humans.\n\nNEXIV uses a CCD camera to detect the edge of the workpiece from an image, and can process data to make complex measurements with high precision. The telecentric optics system does not change size even with focus shift or image blur (the size appears the same whether far or near). This is an appropriate optical system for processing and measuring images because the image dimensions are constant.\n\nBy developing this revolutionary technology, Nikon achieved detection with speed and accuracy beyond the capabilities of humans, which contributes to maintaining quality in inspection processes of cutting-edge precision parts as they become increasingly complex.\n\nBased on the concepts of \"superb image quality\" \"ultra-high speed\" and \"ease of use,\" the Nikon D1 was a lens-interchangeable AF digital SLR camera that was revolutionary in various aspects such as image quality, speed, dimensions, weight and price.\n\nThis project was launched in 1996 directly under the president, and was intended to develop a new and genuine digital camera product within two years. The challenge was taken up by about 10 people from design and other divisions. Initially, team leaders asked for three years on the grounds that two years was insufficient since the company did not possess much accumulated digital technology at that time. However, the response was \"Nikon does not have that much time right now\" and the company endeavored to make it happen in just two short years. In 1998 Nikon released the COOLPIX 900 compact digital camera and the professional D1 digital SLR camera in September the following year. This was a ground-breaking device that offered the comprehensive strengths of excellent image quality, operability and functionality while being only about a third of the price of competitor's products, at JPY 650,000, thereby spurring on the popularization of digital SLR cameras. Since then, Nikon has continued to produce advanced flagship models exceeding professional expectations, right up to the new D5 Nikon digital SLR camera.\n\nMauna Kea, Hawaii rises at 4,205 meters above sea level. As one of the peaks of the world suitable for astronomical observation, numerous countries have brought many telescopes to this location. One of these is the Subaru Telescope, which features the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) and Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS) devices, developments in which Nikon was involved. Research with optical telescopes usually involves three technologies â observation equipment to take photographs, high-dispersion spectrometer equipment, and high-sensitivity low-dispersion spectrometers. With the Subaru Telescope, these consist of the primary focus camera, high-dispersion spectrometer (HDS), and low-dispersion spectrometer (FOCAS).\n\nHDS is a spectroscope that sorts the spectrum of light arriving from distant celestial objects. High-dispersion spectrography of celestial objects plays a role in clarifying the historical origins of various elements by investigating the elemental composition of ancient stars formed around the time of the beginning of the universe. Nikon was responsible for production of the FOCAS body and its main lenses, a device with the power to discover distant galaxies seemingly at the end of the universe.\n\nFOCAS made its first observations in February of 2000. Not only has this device been employed to discover galaxies 12.8 billion light years distant, but also staked its claim with nine of the ten furthest deep space objects announced in 2006 having been found by the Subaru Telescope's prime focus camera.\n\nAnnounced in April of 2005, HDS has discovered stars with the lowest iron composition in the history of observation, and has been successful in measuring elemental compositions. These bodies have only 1/250,000th of the iron composition of the sun. This has led to high anticipation of shedding more light on the initial elemental composition of the early universe.\n\nThe NSR-S609B ArF immersion scanner is a system that exposes silicon wafers with circuit patterns used in LSI manufacturing, and is a revolutionary product proposed to the industry by Nikon ahead of other companies. It radically changed the direction of immersion lithography technology. By filling the gap between the projection lens and the wafer with purified water, the device broke through the N.A.* 1.0 barrier, previously insurmountable with conventional dry exposure, achieving the world's highest N.A. of 1.07.\n\nThe ever-increasing integration of VLSI, a core technology of the IT revolution, means the width of IC circuit lines is required to be narrower. However, IC manufacturing methods that use light to print circuits are limited by a theoretical boundary due to the refractive index of air, beyond which further narrowing is not possible. Thus, liquid immersion exposure technologies with purified water (refractive index 1.44), which has a higher refractive index than air (refractive index of 1) between the semiconductor lithograph lens and the wafer, achieve higher precision by utilizing the liquid itself like a lens. This technology has enabled the manufacture of ICs at the 55-nanometer level or smaller, a major breakthrough beyond the conventional limitation (a nanometer is a millionth of a millimeter). Moreover, liquid immersion exposure technology can be implemented without major changes to the principles or structure of conventional semiconductor lithography equipment, hence enabling swift response to demand along with IC advances.\n\n*N.A. is a performance index for numerical aperture.\n\nIn the field of biosciences, particularly in regenerative medicine and drug manufacture, the use of live cells in research and industry is expected to become more active. Live cells are usually carefully raised in an incubator with a temperature maintained at 37Â°C, the same as the human body, with humidity at 95% and CO2 concentration of 5%. \"BioStation CT\" (cell tracking) is a cell culture observation system that makes it easy to grow cells safely and stably, and control the quality of cells. In the past, cells had to be taken out of the incubator to observe them with a microscope, which although requiring only a short amount of time could result in problems such as reduced cell activity or mold infestation.\n\nBioStation CT is a groundbreaking device that turns convention on its head by including a microscope inside the incubator so that the growth of live cells can be observed without removing them. Since this means growing large amounts of cells with quality control, BioStation CT can also be considered a device enabling laboratory automation for the first time. Although adopted experimentally, it has already been employed in iPS and cancer cell research, producing promising results.\n\nIn recent years, LCDs are increasingly becoming larger with higher definition. The pixel count of HiVision LCD TVs is higher than 2 million, and the number of switches exceeds 6 million with the red, green and blue elements that make up each pixel (2 million x 3 colors). An LCD scanner (FPD lithography system) is used to print the circuits to create these tiny switches on the thin glass plate of the LCD monitor; switches so small they are invisible to the naked eye.\n\nTo manufacture LCDs more efficiently, there is demand to print circuits on even larger areas simultaneously, and produce many display panels from a single glass plate. Nikon responded to the demands for large-size glass plates with a multi-lens array. This enables wide area printing by precisely aligning many projection lenses and entails a self-calibration system that seamlessly joins the exposure patterns of each lens so that large areas can be exposed with precision at the same time.\n\nThe FX-101S handles the world-first 3m x 3m device Gen 10 plate size and propels the rapid spread of large-size TVs, laptop computers, and LCD monitors. Nikon's FPD lithography system is major technology driving the information society.\n\nFor advanced research in the life sciences, optical microscopes are essential, universally sought-after instruments for observing living cells and tissue in detail. However, to view objects 200 nanometers or smaller, such as protein molecules which are too small to be seen with the resolution of conventional optical microscopes, electron microscopes were used. Two ultra-high resolution microscopes achieve resolution that far surpasses that of the conventional optical microscope, realizing observation of the detailed structure of living cells down to the molecular level.\n\nN-SIM employs technology called structured illumination microscopy. This revolutionary technology uses striped illumination and converts the moirÃ© fringes that result into image data of the micro structure to reproduce detailed structural shapes through spatial frequency analysis, and achieves a resolution (115 nanometers) about twice that of conventional optical microscopy. Thus, this enables more detailed observation of living tissue and cells.\n\nN-STORM probabilistic rebuild optical microscopy. This system reconstructs high-resolution fluorescent images by combining position information of individually dyed molecules detected with high precision from multiple fluorescent images. It attains ultra-high resolution roughly 10 times that of optical microscopy, enabling intracellular observation that is a step further toward the molecular level.\n\nUltra-high resolution microscopy technologies provide even greater support to cutting-edge research in universities as well as biological, medical and healthcare institutions.\n\nHigh-accuracy measurement is indispensable in order for advanced processing technologies to attain the extremely strict levels of precision demanded in the precision machining workplace. Conventionally, contact-type measuring equipment was used to inspect machined parts, however this method does not lend itself to quick turnaround, and shortening the time for measurement and reducing measurement points can lead to incomplete evaluation.\n\nInstead, employing lasers to illuminate workpieces to acquire data from many points enables measurement with non-contact 3D measurement. Previously, non-contact 3D measurement equipment was not commercialized in the high-precision field because its accuracy ranged only from several hundred to several tens of micrometers, while the field required higher levels of precision.\n\nThe HN-6060 is a non-contact multi-sensor 3D metrology system developed by Nikon that utilizes light-cutting sensors to provide non-contact measurement with a level of precision on a par with contact measurement. Also, with high-speed digital measurement data conversion, the system achieves high efficiency with 120,000 data items acquired per second.\n\nWhereas items such as gears once required a lot of time to measure, this high-speed, high-precision system correctly assesses the form, from gear teeth tips through to gear valleys, in just a few minutes.\n\nOn the 14th of September 2013, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched its Epsilon rocket, equipped with the Spectroscopic Planet Observatory for Recognition of Interaction of Atmosphere (SPRINT-A), from the Uchinoura Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture. After that, SPRINT-A was injected safely into the orbit and renamed HISAKI. HISAKI is the world's first space telescope dedicated for remote observation of planets such as Venus, Mars and Jupiter, and orbits the earth at an altitude of about 1,000km. Nikon contributed to this project by producing the primary mirror for the telescope (diameter 20cm). This mirror is made of silicon carbide (SiC), a material that is extremely hard and difficult to work, but was successfully completed making full use of the company's high-precision processing technology.\n\nNikon has also contributed to the development of many satellites and space probes including the land observing satellite DAICHI launched in January 2006, the infrared astronomical satellite AKARI launched in February 2006, and the Venus climate orbiter AKATSUKI launched in May 2010. Nikon will continue to provide support to projects by taking up the challenge of space observation and measurement with its high-precision optical design and processing technologies.\n\nThe C3 eMotion operates under Nikon's proprietary double-encoder arrangement (containing two encoders), which enables detection of external forces and robot operation stoppage in response, direct teaching in which the robot can learn commands via direct manipulation by human users, and a wide range of other useful functions.\n\nIn the next generation, expectations for robots are rising, such as their function as future workers in production facilities, operating alongside human workers to cooperatively complete tasks. However, sophisticated skills and know-how are required to build robots, as they comprise a wide array of components.\n\nThe C3 eMotion realized more flexible and easier robot design based on the concept of \"connect, control, cooperate\".\n\nThe Z 9 was developed with the concept of \"proposing how Nikon's flagship mirrorless camera should be\".\n\nEliminating the display delay of the electronic viewfinder that has been taken for granted in mirrorless cameras until now, and featuring a Real-Live Viewfinder that provides constant visibility over the course of the whole shot, the Z 9 completely eradicates stressful blackout. It made it possible to capture decisive moments that were difficult to capture before.\n\nAF speed has evolved into another dimension of immediacy and accuracy with the combined power of the high-speed readout of the stacked CMOS sensor featuring 45.7 effective megapixels, and the EXPEED 7 image-processing engine that dramatically improves processing power.\n\nSubject detection performance has also evolved dramatically. It automatically detects nine types of subjects, including people, animals, birds, and vehicles. Photographers can now concentrate fully on the composition and shutter timing of key moments that were previously difficult to capture.\n\nWhile employing various innovative functions, when it comes to design, Nikon is dedicated to pursuing a close understanding of the way photographers think.\n\nThe Z 9 was designed so that the area touching the palm when gripped is increased, to reduce the feeling of weight and physical load. To that end, we asked many staff members and professional photographers to handle the camera. We were attentively listening to the voices of actual users and repeating shape adjustments right up until the deadline for mass production."
