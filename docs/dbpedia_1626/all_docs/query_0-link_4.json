        "text": "Nikon is a Japanese company that has become one of the most recognizable brand names in the world. And with good reason. The know-how they’ve acquired over the past century when it comes to optics has propelled them to the top of their field. Thanks to their meticulous manufacturing processes and their focus on research and development, Nikon is able to offer a wide range of high-end products that have become a benchmark in the industry.\n\nA Nikon optical technology centre in Montreal\n\nNikon opened its Montreal laboratory – its first lab outside of Japan – in 1989. Today, it is the company’s Canadian base of operations. Out of Nikon’s 200 employees in Canada, 137 work here in Quebec. The team at the Montreal lab are experienced professionals who produce the highest quality ophthalmic lenses.\n\nThanks to its stellar reputation, combined with its local expertise, Nikon is able to make a huge difference in the world of optics. Find out how by watching this video:\n\nHOW PRESCRIPTION LENSES ARE MADE\n\nYour eyes are truly unique. Just like your fingerprints. Nikon knows this and has implemented stringent manufacturing processes to produce products that are perfectly suited to your needs. Here are the 5 steps that allow your eyecare professional to offer you superior quality ophthalmic lenses.\n\n1 – EYE EXAM AND MEASUREMENTS\n\nFollowing your eye exam, the team at your clinic will help you select a pair of frames that are right for you. An optician will then take some measurements which will be used to adapt the lenses to your vision requirements and the frames you’ve picked.\n\n2 – THE DATA IS SENT OVERSEAS\n\nOnce your optometrist has entered your parameters and measurements, they’ll send this information to the Nikon laboratory in Montreal. Then they’re sent to Japan to be processed and optimized by the Nikon Optical Design Engine.\n\n3 – PRECISE CALCULATION\n\nThe cutting-edge Nikon Optical Design Engine is a powerful calculator that is extremely accurate and quick. The Nikon team in Japan use it to determine the perfect formula for your lenses.\n\n4 – THE LENSES ARE PRODUCED\n\nThe data and perfect formula used to calculate the ideal lens surface is sent back to Nikon’s lab in Montreal where they produce about 2,000 lenses every day.\n\nBefore the manufacturing process even begins, the team at Nikon carefully select the right materials to produce thin, light, and scratch-resistant lenses that provide superior UV protection and crisp vision.\n\nThe manufacturing process is complex and includes several steps:\n\nPucks. A robotic machine selects pucks (semi-finished lenses) and places them in a tray. This is the first step in their journey through the lab.\n\nSurfacing. The surface of the lens is precisely cut using the tip of a diamond. The surface of a personalized lens is six times more precise than the surface of a regular lens.\n\nTint. If the lens is designed for tinted sunglasses, this is the step where the colour selected will be applied on the lens.\n\nCoatings. The various treatments (scratch resistance, anti-reflective, oil-repellent, etc.) are applied to the lenses.\n\nCutting and assembly. The lenses are cut into the exact size required and fit into the frame.\n\nFinal inspection and shipping. The lenses are subject to quality control and packed for shipping.\n\nTo ensure only the highest quality lenses are produced, the Nikon lab in Montreal has implemented its own set of rigorous manufacturing standards.\n\n5 – YOUR GLASSES ARE DELIVERED\n\nOnce it has passed quality control, your order is shipped to your Opto-Réseau clinic where the team will assess the lenses again and contact you to let you know your new glasses are ready.\n\nA focus on providing you with the sharpest, most comfortable vision\n\nOphthalmic lens companies, such as Nikon, are constantly optimizing their methods and investing in cutting-edge technologies to improve their manufacturing processes and deliver superior products that meet your exact needs.\n\nTo find out more about how your ophthalmic lenses are made or to find a product that’s right for you, get in touch with your Opto-Réseau eyecare professional."
