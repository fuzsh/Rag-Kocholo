Kind of like the USB-C forcing Apple to comply.\n\nMax Power\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · Nikon Self-Service\n\nIn the automotive world, right to repair just allows independent shops to have access to the equipment required to repair a manufacturer's line of vehicles, not consumers. It gives consumers the choice of shops, not just dealerships. Not sure if right to repair has much to do with consumers.

And if you happen to have a grey-market item, you cannot get service at all if its not for a recall. Its very frustrating, as its impossible to differentiate between a USA model lens and grey market for many of Nikons most expensive models.\n\nArizonaImage\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #9 · p.1 #9 · Nikon Self-Service\n\nNikon1960 wrote:\n\nAt the moment, Nikon customers have no choice of shop whatsoever.\n\nNo shop or individual is allowed to buy most parts needed to service cameras, aside from purely cosmetic items like rubber rings.\n\nSo anyone who has a broken Nikon product is forced to send it into Nikon USA directly and pay whatever they deem the repair should cost.
