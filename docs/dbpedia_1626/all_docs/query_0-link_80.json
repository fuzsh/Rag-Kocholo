        "text": "First published December 2022; updated March 2024.\n\nIt’s one of the most common questions birdwatchers hear: What kind of binoculars should I buy? And it’s hard to give a blanket answer: with hundreds of models at price ranges from under $100 to more than $3,000, the market can be bewildering.\n\nBut the good news is that today’s binocular market is full of great-performing options. Even fairly low price points can deliver bright, crisp images, a comfortable feel, and generous field of view.\n\nWith such a crowded field, we didn’t attempt an across-the-board survey and instead focused on 30 models of 8×42 binoculars—the most popular and versatile binocular style of the last couple of decades.\n\nRecognizing that many birdwatchers are on a budget, we aimed this review at two affordable price tiers: $130–$240 (Budget); and $240–$650 (Mid-Range). (We’ll continue to roll out reviews that cover segments of the market including premium, compact, pocket, other affordable models we missed in this review, and more.)\n\nWith many of today’s binoculars delivering great image quality at these prices, your choice also depends on ergonomics (such as weight, focus wheel, barrel size, eyecups); and how you plan to use them (such as watching feeder birds vs. birding in dim light or at greater distances).\n\nSee The Top-Level Results in One Graph\n\nThis graph shows our ratings and the list price of each binocular in our review. Our ratings were conducted without respect to price, so binocular ratings are comparable across price tiers. (For our review and analysis methods, see the end of this article.)\n\nAs a caveat, remember that binocular rankings are inherently subjective. We do everything we can to make them objective—multiple testers, clear ranking criteria, data analysis—but people’s needs and preferences differ in ways that no single number can capture perfectly. So don’t worry too much about exactly where each binocular sits on the graph, and be sure to try out multiple pairs.\n\nHover over or tap each point to bring up details about the binoculars.\n\nThe rating score is a combination of the binoculars’ image quality, comfort/feel, and perceived build quality (see Review Methods at the end of this article). Binocular prices vary through time and from retailer to retailer. For consistency, we quote prices as MSRP as of Dec 2022. Mobile users: rotate your device for a better view.\n\nHow to Choose: Try Before You Buy, and Ask These Questions\n\nIn years past, choosing binoculars was largely a matter of zeroing in on the relatively few models that delivered premium image quality. Nowadays, image quality can be astoundingly good, leaving room for ergonomics and build quality to be equally important considerations.\n\nOur #1 tip is to try as many binoculars as you can before you buy. Because ergonomics have such an effect, there’s really no substitute for feeling them in your hand, twirling the focus knob, and evaluating how well the image fills your eyes as you look at a bird. It can be hard to find stores that carry a wide range of binoculars to try; we suggest specialty stores like Wild Birds Unlimited, or bird festivals where a wide range of binocular companies will set up booths. (There’s also the option of striking up a conversation on a bird walk, asking your fellow birders how they like theirs, and possibly even swapping for a few minutes.)\n\nAs you’re trying out binoculars, ask yourself these questions to dial in on the best pair for you:\n\nHow does the focus wheel feel?\n\nIs there enough field of view?\n\nDo the binoculars immerse you in the scene?\n\nHow are the weight and balance?\n\nAre the eyecups right for you?\n\nDo you like the accessories?\n\nDoes the manufacturer’s warranty provide enough coverage?"
