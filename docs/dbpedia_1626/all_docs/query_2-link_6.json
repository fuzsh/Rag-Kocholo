        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI just received my Nikon 18-200mm lens today and after looking at the package I\n\nnoticed it said it was made in Thailand instead of Japan. I didn't know how to\n\nsearch this subject on the forum, but remembered reading something about the\n\nThailand lens as being inferior. Should I be concerned ? My order was placed\n\nthrough Best Buy. Kevin, was yours made in Thailand too ? I seem to recall you\n\nwere receiving the same lens from Best Buy, and I'd be interested in knowing if\n\nyours was also made in Thailand. Sorry if this question is stupid, but would\n\nlike reassurances from the experts out there. Thanks in advance for all your\n\nhelp. Have a great weekend !!\n\nI have posted this before. In June last year (2006), I talked to a Nikon rep who had like 4 demo 18-200 DX with him. I noticed that 2 were made in Japan and 2 in Thailand. I asked him about it and he said all the ones you could buy (at that time, June 2006) were made in Thailand. The Japan ones were only demo units. Apparently some early ones sold were made in Japan.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it. Nobody will be able to tell from your final images whether your lens was made in Japan or Thailand, or for that matter, probably not even which lens you use.\n\nThanks to everyone for the prompt responses !! I feel much better now and should have used common sense about Nikon being Nikon and not producing an inferior product no matter where the item was constructed. I just had a nagging thought that somewhere in the forum I had read something negative about this. Thanks again for your help ! Cheers !!\n\nTerry\n\nP.S. Wigwam..........that was hilarious !! My wife and I both got a kick out of that !!"
