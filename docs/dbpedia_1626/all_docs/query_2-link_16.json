        "text": "Paul Nance, has the right answer. <br>\n\n<br>\n\nAfter World War II Japanese products had a very poor reputation.\n\nIn the late fifties I remember my father giving me a hammer,\n\nscrewdriver and pliers for Christmas. I dented the hammer face\n\nwith US made nails and as a child bent the pliers so the jaws no\n\nlonger closed. At this time Nikon was already making fine quality\n\nrangefinder cameras.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nJapans image at that time was much like Chinas today\n\nand the potential mismatch was also the same. China is able to\n\nproduce fine quality products as well as abysmal junk. The JCII\n\nInstitute did force some companies to improve there optical\n\nproducts. Others sold toys, as toys without these stickers.\n\nReally useless toy binoculars were one of the latter products.\n\nThe PASSED stickers did there job and Japan pinched much of\n\nGermanys camera market.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<em>The Japan Camera Industry Institute; formerly the Japan\n\nCamera Inspection Institute. The JCII was founded in 1954 with\n\nthe charter of enforcing strict quality control for all Japanese\n\ncamera products exported overseas.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThe JCII was thus the organization responsible for testing all\n\nJapanese camera exports and applying the once-familiar oval gold\n\nPASSED - JCII sticker onto all equipment which passed. This\n\npractice of applying the gold stickers, which helped cement the\n\nJapanese camera industrys reputation for quality, seems to\n\nhave stopped at some point in the late 1980s. --PhotoNotes.org<br>\n\n</em><br>\n\nHeres a link some may find interesting...<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jcii-cameramuseum.jp/top_e.html\"\n\ntarget=\"_new\"><u>http://www.jcii-cameramuseum.jp/top_e.html</u></a>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIn the sixties and seventies many though the PASSED stickers\n\nindicate that a camera had passed US Customs so the did not\n\nremove the stickers if they though they might travel outside the\n\nUSA.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nBest,<br>\n\n<br>\n\nDave Hartman.\n\nSome of you may have heard this story before........\n\nWhen I was 'coming up' as a photographer in the late 70's / early 80's, having the 'passed' sticker on your camera was considered the badge of a 'poser', somebody who never actually used their camera. It was the first thing to come off, part of putting the first roll of film through a camera.\n\nI did 'a job' where I traveled with a bar band from NW Washington across the border into Canada, photographing their 'gig'. I was riding in their van back across the border (into the US) at 3:00 am. The agent (not sure if it was customs or border patrol) decided we looked unsavory (driver had a lock of purple hair) and detained us for a detailed search.\n\nWhen he got to my camera bag, he said, \"Your equipment doesn't have the 'passed' sticker on it. These were not bought in the US.\"\n\nI blurted out the first thought in my (young, foolish) mind: \"Surely you can't be that stupid!\"\n\nHe impounded my gear. Talking with the supervisor did not help. He looked very uncomfortable about the whole mess, but he 'backed his guy'. They wanted me to return to the border with 'proof' that I had bought the gear in the US and not while we were in Canada.\n\nI stewed about this for about an hour (while they tore the drums apart and stuff like that). I finally remembered I had itemized insurance paperwork under the 'floor' of the bag. I brought this to their attention (more 'raised eyebrows' about this 'hidden compartment') and they begrudgingly released the gear to me.\n\nI think it's true to say that many modern lenses would fail the quality controls set up all those years ago.The temperature compensated plastic imitation cardboard stuck together with tape lenses are not what I would call quality!\n\nI am sure that an enterprising high volume camera manufacturer could make good use of the latter letters! Try NiCan 18-50 F4.5-F6.9 TCPICSTWT..plus the pre requisite AFS,IF,L,VR etc. Naturally the designation would have to be in a imitation gold leaf to fit the superior nature of the lens which would be available with either a gold ring or a red ring around the barrel.I'm not sure if the lens box should be lined with a genuine imitation red or blue velvet?"
