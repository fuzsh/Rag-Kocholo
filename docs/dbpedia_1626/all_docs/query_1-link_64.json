        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe focus of the rivalry is high-end models. While Nikon models are in the range of Rs 32,950 to Rs 5 lakh, Canon's is a tad less than Nikon's.\n\nLast year, when Pune-based techie Ravi Sathyu uploaded his newly born son’s pictures on Facebook, he got around 150 “likes”. But to his 68-year-old mother, who has always had a caustic tongue, the photographs were “slightly blurred” and lacked “character”. Sathyu said she should meet an eye specialist. But a month later, he decided that his mother could be right about the “monotonous” part.\n\nAfter experimenting with his wife’s digital camera and consulting an artist friend who suggested he buy a “proper camera”, Sathyu walked into a Nikon shop in Mumbai and bought a Nikon D3100, plus a few lenses, that cost around Rs 50,000. “I was also inspired by my favourite actress Priyanka Chopra [who features in a Nikon ad],” says the 35-year-old. “This time my mother didn’t say the pictures were bad,” he says.\n\nThe “proper camera” was a digital SLR, or single lens reflex, camera, which offers a far more accurate preview of framing compared with point-and-shoot cameras.\n\nRenowned Mumbai-based fashion photographer Ashok Salian also swears by DSLR cameras. Only, Salian is a “loyal and exclusive” user of Canon. “Technology has made photography much easier,” says Salian who has shot numerous Bollywood stars, including his favourite Dimple Kapadia before the release of Saagar in 1984. “Most people acquire a DSLR camera to stay more creative,” he says.\n\nSalian and Sathyu are part of a growing tribe of Indians, professional and amateur, who are splurging on DSLR cameras like never before, thanks to their high disposable incomes. That makes India one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for such cameras, at a time when camera sales are stagnating in the West and Japan.\n\nCapturing Moments\n\nFor Japanese arch rivals Canon and Nikon, the biggest players in the segment, India along with China is leading the charge. Between them, the two companies sell almost 99% of the DSLR cameras that Indians buy. In a country where camera penetration is a mere 6%, the growth for DSLRs has been close to 100% in the past few years, says Canon India senior vice-president Alok Bharadwaj.\n\nHe says in the Rs 4,500-crore Indian camera market, DSLR cameras account for Rs 750 crore. Another Rs 750 crore comes from selling interchangeable lenses and accessories. One of the biggest advantages of using a DSLR is that it lets the user choose from a variety of interchangeable lenses.\n\n“Well, if it is technology that made and destroyed the analogous camera [the ones with films], it is technology that reshaped the camera, the digital ones,” notes Bharadwaj. “In 2002, when we started selling digital cameras, we sold some 150 cameras across the country. The next year it was 10,000. The DSLR is growing faster than compact cameras.”\n\nSajjan Kumar, general manager at Nikon India, which started local operations in 2007, says camera-fitted mobile phones are the catalyst. People then migrate to compact cameras and later to DSLRs, he says.\n\nNever Mind Price\n\nIn their passion for photography, Indians, a notoriously price-conscious society, are willing to overlook the costs. Nikon models cost in the range of Rs 32,950 to upwards of Rs 5 lakh while Canon’s entry-level camera is a tad less than Nikon’s. Delhi-based artist and photographer Gigi Scaria says he has seen many friends veering towards DSLR cameras in recent years.\n\nFifteen-year-old Manasvi Jerath, a student of the Shri Ram School in Delhi, is a classic example. After fiddling around with her iTouch and a basic digital camera for a year, she developed a taste for the “art of photography” and, to encourage her, her father bought her a Canon EOS 1100D. The resultant photographs got her on the school’s editorial board.\n\n“It is a quest for taking higher quality pictures that even amateurs are spending their hard-earned money on high-end cameras,” says renowned sculptor Riyas Komu. Komu says he made several of his documentaries using his Canon 5D. Recently, he was in Madurai shooting an art documentary on Kannaki, the heroine of the Tamil epic Silapatikaram.\n\n“While amateurs are using them to be tap into their creativity, professionals are using them thanks to ease of use and high quality,” says Komu. “The fact is you can’t show your back to technology. Nobody can resist its onslaught.”\n\nBig Bets\n\nIndeed, Canon expects its India sales to nearly double to Rs 5,000 crore in the next three years. “We expect Rs 3,000 crore to come from digital cameras; of that, at least half will be from digital SLR camera sales,” says Bharadwaj. The greatest thing DSLR cameras have done is to have completely changed the gratification you have seeing a picture, says Bharadwaj. “With DLR cameras, they say, you don’t take, but make pictures,” he says.\n\nCanon is expanding rapidly in India, Bharadwaj says, adding that “technology innovation is crucial for such an expansion”. The $4.5-billion Tokyo-headquartered company is due to introduce a camera with Wi-Fi capability in India, a few weeks after its Japan launch. This camera helps the user instantly upload pictures from cameras to devices such as computers, tablet PCs and smartphones. Canon will also launch other products this year, including camcorders.\n\nNikon too is upbeat about the growth potential in DSLR cameras in the local market. The company has cornered a roughly 55% market share compared with Canon’s 44%. Nikon is also looking to launch many of its high-end and entry-level products in the country, including its D4, D800 series. “We would look at adding the Wi-Fi feature in one of the launches,” says Kumar.\n\nThe two rivals are also spending aggressively, on ads especially, to connect with the country’s “nearly 94% un-penetrated market” for cameras. Nikon spent Rs 120 crore on the ad featuring Chopra. The buoyant growth of DSLR cameras in India is both surprising and crucial, given that DSLR sales around the world this past year have been hurt by a number of factors.\n\nNotes Faisal Kawoosa, manager of Semiconductor and Electronics Practice at market research firm CyberMedia Research: “The tsunami in Japan, the floods in Thailand, tepid performance of the US economy, the eurozone economic crisis, and the protests in the Middle East and North Africa all contributed to largely subdued consumer markets.” “The ongoing proceedings against Japanese vendor Olympus in a major accounting scandal and the bankruptcy filing by Kodak on January 19 in a US court further added to the uncertainty.”\n\nConnect Aggressively\n\nGiven this backdrop, it shouldn’t be surprising that both companies have built an impressive network to connect with the Indian customer. Nikon has 22 service centres across the country, including four main stores in the metros. It has 18 other smaller “service facilities” and close to 50 “collection centres” with local partners. Nikon is also “engaged with 2,500 channel partners” who help sell its models, some eight of them as of now, says Kumar.\n\nCanon has opened 50 stores, called Canon Image Square, in 32 towns. Each store posted Rs 3 crore in sales last year. By this year-end, it expects to launch 110 such stores across the country. “We are targeting 300 such stores by 2015, and we expect 50% of sales from each of these stores to be DSLR cameras,” says Bharadwaj.\n\n“Canon Edge” is an India-specific online platform which has nearly 1.75 lakh members. Through this, the company offers photography tips, and runs photography blogs to familiarise amateurs and first-time buyers with Canon’s products. This is a venture that could be reciprocated in Canon’s other markets, says Bharadwaj.\n\nThe company has also signed up photographers like Raghu Rai to offer training. It also organises an annual contest called “photo marathon”. “You take pictures the whole day, and if they are good, you win a DSLR camera as a prize,” says Bharadwaj.\n\nBoth Nikon and Canon organise outdoor workshops in “interesting” locations such as Ladakh and Kerala as part of their marketing initiatives. People are charged a nominal fee for similar day-long workshops in cities and have to pay for travel and accommodation in longer ones elsewhere. “This is to ensure that someone who uses our product buys our product,” says Nikon’s Kumar.\n\nTravel, Movies etc\n\nBoth companies seem to have found a sweet spot in travel, with Indians travelling more than ever. The travel bug is one of the key drivers for the growth in sales of DSLR cameras, say both Kumar and Bharadwaj. As the Indian economy grows at a fast clip compared with the rest of the world, Indians are spending more on pleasure and luxury.\n\nRaju Kothari, owner of Photo Kina, a Chowpatty, Mumbai-based “photography hub” where several senior photographers had begun their career as interns, says, “I see the younger ones very particular about the camera they choose. For them, the camera is like your old Rolex, a tag they want to carry with them wherever they travel.”\n\nPeople want their memories of travel to last, perhaps forever; hence, the stress on quality of pictures. “We also learn from other members of our club about how to improve our skills in photography,” says A Sulaiman, a Chennai-based businessman and a member of photography club Spot.\n\nPicture Perfect\n\nA number of other factors are also driving growth. Lucknow-based Ajai Kumar says he takes pictures and uploads them on Facebook. He “reserves a few special ones” for friends and close family on Flikr. “I wait for the reaction from my friends, some of the pros,” he says.\n\nThat the price has become more affordable thanks to technology and higher sales have helped buyers. Says artist Komu: “Prices of DLSR have come down over the years thanks to new technologies.”\n\nTrue, companies are making more of mass-consumption DSLR cameras to meet burgeoning demand. “Prices have come down thanks to economies of scale,” observes Kothari. Family occasions and weddings are also key growth drivers, says Bharadwaj. Wedding photography is increasingly generating jobs, he adds.\n\nAll this is music to the ears of executives of Canon and Nikon. “We expect rapid growth in the next three years,” says Bharadwaj. Nikon’s Kumar can’t agree with him more.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
