I'd be delighted to get a brand new 35 mm f/2 or faster for a pre-AI F mount at that kind of price (yes, likely a bit more because bigger glass, but under $150 would still be remarkable).\n\nAnd if they do, are they as good as the reviews make the digital ones sound?\n\nJoined\n\nJul 13, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n730\n\nLocation\n\nEurope (EU)\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nAug 1, 2023\n\n#2\n\nI own two original Nikkor 35/2's. One non-AI the other AIS. Both bought within the last two years. Neither above $150.\n\nI see no reason to buy poor QC Chinese lenses when you can get the real thing for less.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n13,004\n\nLocation\n\nIowa City, Iowa USA\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nAug 1, 2023\n\n#3\n\nI'm extremely reluctant to buy stuff like TTArtisan products. However, I picked up a 28mm f5.6 Leica knock off lens, returned to B&H in Leica M mount. It's really a nice lens, within reason. Coatings are on par with early coated lenses. Lens hood very clumsy, but still quite nice.\n\nVoigtlander lenses, bought used from Japan get pretty cheap and are stellar.

On the other hand, you can get a native Zuiko 25mm lens, which while slower will have about the same angle of view.\n\nFor Nikon F, you need at least 44mm clearance to achieve infinity focus (a film-to-flange distance of 46.5mm).\n\nreddesert\n\nJoined\n\nJul 22, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n2,038\n\nLocation\n\nSAZ\n\nFormat\n\nHybrid\n\nAug 1, 2023\n\n#5\n\nYou could look on the B&H website and filter by the characteristics you want, such as Nikon mount, manual focus, and then down select by brand or price. The only TTartisan and 7artisan lenses that I see that way are a couple of full frame fisheyes - there are also a few lenses by more expensive new brands such as Venus or Mitakon.\n\nThere are so many Nikon brand manual focus lenses - 35/2 is very common - on the used market that I don't think new 3rd party lenses are a compelling alternative, unless they offer something that was exotic in the heyday of film lenses, like fisheyes or super speed lenses. I think it is also significantly harder to make a full 35mm frame lens for a competitive price than for DX/APS format. That said, I don't think it is necessary to slag all of these new lens brands as \"poor QC Chinese.\" I wish Photrio could get away from using national origin as an epithet.\n\nFinally, a lens made for Nikon AI mount will fit on a pre-AI camera just fine; even a Nikon AF lens will work if it has an aperture ring, the only lack would be the meter coupling prong.\n\nJoined\n\nJan 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,741\n\nLocation\n\nMN and MA US\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nAug 1, 2023\n\n#6\n\nI just received a TT Artisans lens for my Sony mirrorless.

I had no expectation of a Fuji mirrorless or other APS-C lens being convertible to Nikon F mount -- and Pen F mount only possible because the camera has such short flange to film and similar image area.\n\nBut okay, I need to be looking on KEH or similar for used 35/2 or 28/2.8 made for Nikon rather than hoping for someone to bring a new product into such a full house.\n\n250swb\n\nJoined\n\nApr 22, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,309\n\nLocation\n\nPeak District\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nAug 4, 2023\n\n#9\n\nBut okay, I need to be looking on KEH or similar for used 35/2 or 28/2.8 made for Nikon rather than hoping for someone to bring a new product into such a full house.\n\nIt's a very valid question, and anyway why should Leica users have all the fun? TT Artisan, Light Lens Lab, 7Artisans, etc. all make very good lenses (who knows, they may even be made in the same factory). And the world has shifted from simple budget lenses for Nikon made by Tamron, etc. to photographers wanting something just a bit better, or different, or interesting, or creative, or exciting, and these new companies can do it in spades and with a high degree of technical ability. There are enough options already if anybody just wants to buy a lens for a Nikon film camera, but not nearly enough that come into the connoisseur category in the same way that people enjoy using lenses with their Leica M's.\n\nJoined\n\nJan 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,741\n\nLocation\n\nMN and MA US\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nAug 4, 2023\n\n#10\n\nIt's a very valid question, and anyway why should Leica users have all the fun?

Their lenses for RF and digital mirrorless are simpler to make since no auto diaphragm mechanism. Image quality? We'll see.

I'm not sure why that should be confused with what's on the market now?

Light Lens Lab are even remanufacturing exact copies of older recipe Leica lenses (including the glass recipe) when they are very rare and basically unavailable for many people, and Leica themselves are even showing Voigtlander lenses on an M body in advertising.

I'm not the one knocking the TTArtisan lenses. Unless you're reacting to my \"does image quality matter\" point. That's not a criticism of the TTArtisan lenses; that's a point about obsessing on image quality when all we do is look at an image on a computer (or worse, phone) screen.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n13,004\n\nLocation\n\nIowa City, Iowa USA\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nAug 5, 2023\n\n#13\n\nThe inexpensive China made lenses are not as good as expensive Leica lenses. The TT 28mm f5.6 in M mount is a decent lens at f 8, I've used one of these on a digital M body. The coatings are nothing like what you see on Leica and Cosina lenses."
