        "text": "Introduction\n\nIf you are looking for used lenses or cameras, Japan can be a real dream destination. Having already been there two times myself I know from first hand experience that it isn’t easy to locate some of the more interesting stores though. My Finnish expat friend Juha Kannisto – who is living in Tokyo – has been helping out photographers from all over the world for years already when it comes to this topic.\n\nI thought it would be useful to collect all this knowledge and turn it into an easy-to-access article, so here we are.\n\nIf you think a store is missing that should definitely be on this list leave a comment or get in touch on our Discord server.\n\nGeneral Remarks\n\nLocating the Stores\n\nIf you are from the western world and it is your first time in an Asian metropolis it might actually be very hard for you to locate some of these stores – despite having the Google Maps coordinates.\n\nWe are used to stores having flashy shop fronts at the ground level, but for most of the camera shops in Tokyo (or Hong Kong) this is not the case. Most of the time they only have an unobtrusive door with a sign with only Japanese writing at the ground level. Sometimes they are also on a higher floor of a building, that from first sight definitely does not look like it will house a camera store at all.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe chance to encounter a salesperson in these stores that speaks English is very low. In Map Camera and Kitamura you should be able to find someone, but in the others stores you definitely need to be lucky for that.\n\nGenerally the Japanese people are very friendly and polite and will try to help you nevertheless. I often wrote down in Google translate on my phone what I was looking for in English, had it translated to Japanese and showed it to them. Every single time they were happy to assist.\n\nHaggling is more of a no-go in Japan though and considered rude behaviour. The prices on the items are final, unless you are a frequently recurring customer, in those cases the salesperson may offer a discount.\n\nJapan is a Cash Country\n\nOnly the bigger stores accept card payments. This means some of the stores on this list only accept cash. The smaller stores usually also don’t offer tax free shopping.\n\nTokyo – Shinjuku\n\nMap Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite/Online Shop\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nBig selection of new cameras and lenses as well as used ones for all major Japanese brands. Good selection of rangefinder lenses.\n\nLeica & other rangefinder cameras and lenses are available at B1 floor. Major Japanese brands at 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor, 5th floor is trade-in section. There is also a Leica Boutique at the ground floor, that makes locating the store much easier.\n\nAbout 10% cheaper for new items than major chain stores like Bic Camera, Yodobashi Camera etc., but those chain stores give 10% store points instead for bonus point card holders.\n\nThe items that are marked as “Net limited” on their website are not available to buy at the physical store. They can only be bought online.\n\nTax free sales are available at the physical store.\n\nBastian’s Notes:\n\nMap Camera also sells a wide selection of used lenses through their global ebay online store (affiliate link). Prices are often attractive, but if you live in Europe, keep in mind that you may have to pay steep custom duties (e.g. 25.7% extra if you live in Germany).\n\nYou can also order lenses through their actual website, but if you order from overseas the process is rather complicated and also comes with additional fees.\n\nI asked and their used lenses are not checked for centering, keep that in mind, as returning a lens you are not happy with might not be economically possible, as you usually have to pay the return shipping yourself.\n\nShinjuku Used Camera Market\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nTwitter\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nMostly focusing on old used film cameras and SLR & rangefinder lenses. Very good selection of Japanese LTM lenses and SLR lenses.\n\nLots of items are sold on consignment and it’s best to check the quality at the counter carefully before buying. They accept Japanese yen cash payments only, no credit cards.\n\nLemon\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nGood selection of used rangefinder lenses and SLR lenses and film cameras & some older digital cameras.\n\nSome items are sold on consignment and it’s best to check the quality at the counter carefully before buying.\n\nSome new Voigtländer lenses available as well, but generally very limited selection of new items.\n\nKitamura\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nOnline Shop\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nUsed cameras and lenses in 4th floor of this specific store. Very small store in this location but they have a much larger presence nationwide.\n\nUsed Camera Box\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nThis shop is underground with lots of stuff packed in tight space inside glass vitrines. Difficult to assess what they have. Interesting shop to check out, but not the best for purchasing.\n\nFive Star Camera West\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nUsed cameras and lenses on 2nd floor, mostly film cameras and Japanese SLR lenses, but some newer ones as well. Also a collection of used rangefinder lenses.\n\nThey also have a junk item store in B1 floor in the same building with old junk film cameras and lenses at low prices.\n\nFotoborse / Gokurakudo (Toyama District)\n\nLocation on Google Maps Fotoborse\n\nLocation on Google Maps Gokurakudo\n\nEnglish access instructions\n\nWebsite Fotoborse\n\nWebsite Gokurakudo (old)\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nThis pair of small stores that are under same ownership are more difficult to access than other camera stores since they are in a rather residential area near Shinjuku, away from the shopping centre areas.\n\nThey are however some of the most interesting shops selling 2nd hand cameras and rangefinder & SLR lenses so definitely worth a visit, and they tend to have items that other stores might not have.\n\nThe “Contax store” is Gokurakudo on the left side and Fotoborse is Rangefinder and non-Contax SLR lens focused store right next to it on the right side.\n\nThe main Website is the Fotoborse one, Gokurakudo site is quite old.\n\nThey have perhaps the widest selection of used rangefinder lenses available in Tokyo and they also have good number of interesting SLR lenses that other stores might not have.\n\nSometimes only the Gokurakudo (Contax) store is open and staff there can be asked to open the other side when a customer wants to see that one.\n\nTokyo – Nakano\n\nFujiya Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps main store\n\nLocation on Google Maps junk store\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nThe best alternative to Map Camera. Lots of new and used cameras and lenses. Best selection of Voigtländer lenses along with Map Camera. Tax free available.\n\nThere are 2 floors on the main store with Sony, Canon, Olympus, Sigma & Panasonic on the ground floor and Rangefinder lenses, Fuji, Nikon at 2nd floor.\n\nTypically same exact prices as in Map Camera for new items but used items can sometimes be priced better than at Map.\n\nAll the items found on their website are available at the physical store as they have no separate warehouse for online sales (unlike Map Camera).\n\nJunk store on the same street is good for buying lens pouches, used and generic low cost lens caps, filters, neckstraps etc. Those items are not listed on their website.\n\nTokyo – Shibuya\n\nKitamura\n\nGoogle Maps Location\n\nOnline Shop\n\nWebsite\n\nBastian’s Notes:\n\nThis is much bigger than the one in Shinjuku. While the ground floor looks like this store is only selling accessories and instant cameras, there are three floors on top where you can find pretty much every modern lens and also a lot of rare rangefinder and SLR lenses. Prices were a bit on the high side, but if you are looking for something specific this one is worth a visit.\n\nTokyo – Akihabara\n\nLemon\n\nLocation on Google Maps located on the 3rd floor\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nAkihabara branch shop of Lemon. Smaller than the stores in Ginza and Shinjuku, but quite packed with items.\n\nGood selection of used rangefinder lenses and SLR lenses and film cameras & some older digital cameras.\n\nAlso here some items are sold on consignment and should be checked carefully.\n\nNisshin Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nA moderate selection of rangefinder and SLR lenses as well as modern lenses and also used film/digital cameras.\n\n2nd Base by Sanpou Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nFairly recent trendy / fashionable little shop for the younger crowd who are into film cameras and old lenses.\n\nAll items are presented in a nice looking way. Not so large collection. Fashionable old rangefinder and SLR lenses and film cameras.\n\nTokyo – Ginza\n\nLemon\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nBastian’s Notes:\n\nInterestingly this shop shares the building with a church and is at the 8th floor. Like the Lemon in Shinjuku a good selection of used rangefinder lenses and SLR lenses and film cameras & some older digital cameras. They also had one of the bigger assortments of (expensive) analogue film I came across in Tokyo.\n\nShimizu Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nBastian’s Notes:\n\nA small corner shop in Ginza that carries mainly old rangefinder and SLR lenses and also a lot of film cameras. When I was visiting there were a lot of LTM lenses at very affordable prices (compared to the stores in Shinjuku) available. Cash payment only, no tax free option.\n\nSukiya Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nA nice but very small old shop at Ginza close to Lemon and on the same street as Shimizu Camera.\n\nGood selection of used rangefinder lenses in M/LTM and some other mounts. Also new Voigtländer lenses mostly in M-mount.\n\nIn some cases better prices compared to other stores and some good finds can be made there occasionally. Most items are in very good condition.\n\nTheir current item stock cannot be found on their website.\n\nTokyo – Ueno\n\nShinbashi Ichi Camera\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nJuha’s Notes:\n\nInteresting selection of used rangefinder lenses. Some attractive less common lenses could be found there, also analogue medium format cameras & lenses.\n\nKyoto\n\nCamera no Naniwa\n\nLocation on Google Maps\n\nWebsite\n\nBastian’s Notes:\n\nA generalist store that has a bit of everything. Not that spectacular compared to most of the stores in Tokyo on this list, but your first address in Kyoto if you need an adapter, filter or some analogue films.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this article will help you to find the most interesting camera stores in Tokyo in order to track down what you are looking for.\n\nA big thanks to Juha for providing most of the information in this article.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAll Lens Reviews\n\nAnalogue Adventures Landing Page\n\nAdapting Lenses – Still worth it today?\n\nBokeh explained\n\nSupport Us"
