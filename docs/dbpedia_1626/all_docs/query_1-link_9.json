But this is not always the case.\n\nTechnically, Nikon should be Nihkon, but its founder is rumored to have pronounced it Neekon.\n\nOf course, the doesn't prevent people from pronouncing it however they wish.\n\nNikon Corporation (that's the Japanese parent company) officially blesses all regional pronunciations, so there is no single \"correct\" pronunciation. This fact is easy to verify by looking at advertising produced by Nikon's subsidiaries around the world, which all use varying regional pronunciation (i.e. 'nick-on' in the UK, 'nye-kon' in the U.S., 'nee-kon' in Japan etc.)\n\n'Nikon' is a made up word -- a brand name neologism, like 'Xerox' or 'Microsoft' -- created and owned by what is now Nikon Corp (formerly Nippon Kogaku, K.K.) so the company is the sole authority on this question, and they are quite clear about it: they approve all varying regional pronunciations. The good news is that we're all doing it right!\n\nAlso, Nikon does not have a founder in any normal sense of that word. Nippon Kogaku K.K. (Japan Optical, Inc.) was created by the Mitsubishi industrial combine (zaibatsu) in 1917. It was formed by combining three pre-existing optical companies, which Mitsubishi bought and merged into what is now Nikon. Mitsubishi owned Nippon Kogaku outright until 1947, when the U.S. occupation authorities disbanded the zaibatsu and all of Mitsubishi's subsidiaries became technically independent companies.\n\nNippon Kogaku first used the 'Nikkor' brand name in the early 1930s on lenses that the company made for aerial cameras, if memory serves. The 'Nikon' brand name was not created until 1947/48 when Nippon Kogaku began to make its first consumer cameras (it made aerial cameras for the Japanese military in the 1930s-40s, but the cameras themselves were not branded; they just said 'Nippon Kogaku')."
