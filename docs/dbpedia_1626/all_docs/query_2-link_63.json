        "text": "Nikon losing the leadership position to Canon in the market for professional photography is a story involving technology transitions over a period of 30 or more years as told in this annotated twitter thread.\n\nSteven Sinofsky\n\n¬∑\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nLearning By Shipping\n\n¬∑\n\n7 min read\n\n¬∑\n\nApr 8, 2018\n\n--\n\nAnnotations in italics.\n\nThe Canon F-1 mechanical film camera from 1971 had over 10,000 parts. It was designed to compete with the Nikon F released 12 years earlier (with fewer parts) and despite the complexity was not really a competitive risk.\n\nI was asked in a follow-up where the 10,000 parts number came from. Here‚Äôs the 1971 brochure from Canon Japan with this tagline. Interestingly it is clearly hyperbole and also a tricky Japanese translation (does it means the system or the camera?).\n\nThe Canon ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (1) was designed to compete with the Nikon F system, which had 10 years of ecosystem growth.\n\nLess than a year after Canon, Nikon released the culmination of a 5 year project, the F2 (2), which overwhelmed Canon which barely resembled 1962 Nikon System (3).\n\nNikon took a very conservative approach to adding features having secured (and defended) the professional market. 8 years later they released the Nikon F3 which *required* batteries for the *first time*, but even had a backup mechanical shutter release that was heavily marketed. As crazy as it sounds, professionals, especially National Geographic types on assignment, were terrified of running out of batteries so Nikon catered to them. My first camera on my own was an F3 and all the reviews (which I memorized) at the time mentioned this manual shutter release.\n\nAll along Nikon was incredibly innovative with consumer cameras where they felt they could ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù. Nikon released dozens of models with automatic exposure, fancy metering, integrated motor drives, and eventually even auto focus in 1986. Many more consumer models than pro!\n\nAlso Nikon was very busy working with Kodak on pioneering digital cameras. All through the 1990s there were incredible advances that relied on Nikon camera bodies and optics and Kodak digital sensors.\n\nNikon was even first to release professional digital cameras with the much anticipated Nikon D-1 in 1999.\n\nCanon could not win over pros. Nikon was innovating but was still all about Pros being in ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù and ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, eg every lens from 1959 forward still worked on current cameras. #professional\n\nCanon took a bold step and designed a whole new lens system around *autofocus*. It was vastly criticized by professionals and the press at the time for breaking compatibility with Canon‚Äôs existing FD mount (which itself had maintained compatibility over 3 generations of Canon lenses going back to the 1960s). This lens mount made driving autofocus much more efficient and fast and also easily supported automatic exposure known as ‚Äúshutter priority‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù where Nikon on professional cameras only supported aperture priority until the F4 was released in 1988 (after Canon‚Äôs EF mount, but still compatible with the F mount) though the 1983 Nikon FA pro-sumer camera supported these automatic modes. I think we can draw some fascinating lessons from how professionals react to change from this since these patterns repeat and have repeated themselves.\n\nThis was 1987! So there was still a long haul. Canon focused (ha) on consumers, ease of use, and reliability of electronics and began to win with a full range of autofocus lenses and gained expertise with consumer cameras.\n\nThey were going after Nikon from the underserved market.\n\nWhile Nikon had invented [productized or commercialized] all the technology from electronic metering, to autofocus, to digital, Canon was going to use it all to win over professionals while Nikon was concerned about both cannibalization and just not serving professionals as well. See where this is going??\n\nIn 2000, right when Nikon released its Digital Pro SLR, Canon released one as well but had their much better autofocus lenses and all that experience, and was also willing to sacrifice ‚Äúquality‚Äù for speed. Enter the Canon EOS digital line.\n\nProfessionals photogs, especially sports, were all about speed and saw the advantages of autofocus. Canon capitalized with an incredible range of lenses built from the start for autofocus and sports, along with these new digital bodies. Also they made their lenses white.\n\nFrom 1981, when Canon was developing autofocus here is a magazine article about how autofocus works. It is telling that they explain how it works from the perspective of Canon even though Nikon productized modern autofocus.\n\nSeemingly overnight Canon captured the professional market. This is Canon‚Äôs system today. While numerically they have about 60% market share, they have a much higher mindshare. Disruption happens two ways‚Äîfirst slowly and then quickly.\n\nThis is such a fascinating case of a company, Nikon, literally inventing the whole category, then reinventing it, pioneering every technology but falling victim to its own success ‚Äî focus on existing needs, current limitations, and compatibility. Nikon still goes to space though!\n\nThis kills me because, well, I have been using Nikon since my father gave me his 1971 F and I collect them. But I also think about this evolution and how technology incumbents can succumb to success. // end\n\nPS/ Nikon did not invent the 35mm SLR! In fact it got into the business by making lenses for existing makers while it focused on professional rangefinder cameras (below). Nikon‚Äôs original corporate name was Nippon Kogaku, which translates as Japan Optical.\n\nThat said, the 1959 Nikon system was very much like the 1964 IBM 360 in scope, reuse, industry impact.\n\nPPS/ In 1971 Canon tried to compete head-on w/Nikon, even with some parity, it offered nothing substantial that Nikon didn‚Äôt offer and had a much smaller ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and ecosystem. Competing head-on rarely works. Reviews at the time ‚Äútried‚Äù to make it a race, but was‚Äôt even close.\n\nPPPS/ Was asked‚Ä¶1950‚Äôs Nikon made optics for Leica (can you believe!) the leader in rangefinder cameras used by Pros. Nikon clearly learned from that and much like China mfgs w/their own consumer brands, they went ‚Äúfirst party‚Äù with the F system. FYI, Sony makes Nikon sensors.ü§î Nikon has been slowly displacing Sony sensors and the latest pro and pro-sumer cameras no longer use Sony sensors. And fwiw, Canon got into cameras by creating cheaper copies of other‚Äôs rangefinder cameras and using other company‚Äôs lenses. They then later moved into making lenses as well. See the pattern‚Ä¶\n\nI will amend this with corrections I receive since posting anything about Nikon history or especially Nikon v. Canon will almost certainly get me in trouble."
