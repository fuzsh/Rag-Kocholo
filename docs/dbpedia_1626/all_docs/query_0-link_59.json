        "text": "The history of Nikon cameras begins in 1917. The first cameras and lenses were focused on inspection systems. It was not until 1948 when the Japanese brand launched its first analog camera.\n\nFrom the beginning, Nikon has been known for maintaining its F line for its objectives. This allowed them from the beginning, a great facility to move to the digital world. The compatibility of its lenses for analog cameras with digital cameras has made Nikon one of the reference brands for professional photographers.\n\nThis change to the digital world was also marked by the great reputation in the focus of their cameras and the great features they offered. Thanks to these reasons, a large part of photography fans started with this brand in the early years.\n\nToday, Nikonâ€™s strong suit continues to be DSLRs, both full-frame and APS-C. Although a little late, they are working hard in the field of mirrorless. The new Nikon Zs have arrived later than the competition, but their quality promises. With a much wider mount diameter than the competition, it will allow Nikon to develop cameras and lenses with greater light capture.\n\nLearn the best techniques during our Japan Photography Workshops\n\nCheap Nikon Cameras Deals\n\nNikon Camera Range\n\nNikonâ€™s catalog is focused to range from a general consumer to professionals who require the best features. You can find Nikon cameras from a compact with basic functions to next-generation mirrorless. Its greatest offer is found in the SLR market, where you can find everything from low-end cameras to Full Frames with the latest technologies.\n\nThis focus on DSLRs leads them to be able to offer a large catalog of lenses. Their quality and their F mount make Nikon a brand where you can improve your camera little by little. You can use your lenses on both a low-end camera and a high-end camera.\n\nTheir catalog of compact cameras is not very large. However, their quality lets users know that they are choosing high-quality cameras.\n\nIf we talk about mirrorless Nikon, its experience is not as great as Sony cameras. After putting aside their first mirrorless, they are currently launching a new series called Z. The range of Nikon mirrorless cameras that you can find on the market is not very large. By using the Z mount for lenses, they have solved the problem by releasing a wide variety of quality mirrorless lenses from Nikon.\n\nJoin our next Spain Photo Tour\n\nBest Nikon Cameras by Category of 2020\n\nNikon Lens Range\n\nChoosing the best lens for your Nikon camera can be confusing.
