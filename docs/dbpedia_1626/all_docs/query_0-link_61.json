        "text": "A reference point for all current Nikon Z mirrorless equipment, from the obvious to the obscure.\n\nThis article is a bird’s eye view of all Nikon Z System products available at the moment, including cameras, lenses, and official accessories. It is intended as a complete guide to the entire series of Nikon Z mirrorless products so that any photographer can understand the scope of Nikon Z mirrorless equipment. This guide is kept up-to-date with every new product announced by Nikon for their Z series.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNikon Z Cameras\n\nNikon has a lot of mirrorless Z cameras available for purchase at the moment, although the Z6 and Z7 are already discontinued in some markets. I’ll go through them all below.\n\nNote that every Nikon Z camera so far has one of two sensor sizes: an APS-C sensor with a 1.5x crop factor (which Nikon calls DX cameras) and a standard full-frame sensor (which Nikon calls FX cameras). DX cameras are generally smaller, lighter, and less expensive than FX cameras. However, they do have some drawbacks in dynamic range and high ISO performance because of the smaller sensor. See Nikon DX vs FX.\n\nDX (1.5x Crop Sensor) Cameras\n\nNikon Z50\n\nAnnounced: November 2019\n\nSensor size: DX\n\nResolution: 20.9 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 209-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 11 FPS\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 30p\n\nBattery life: 300 photos\n\nControl layout: Low to mid-range\n\nMemory cards: 1 SD (UHS-I compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 450 g (0.99 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 127 × 94 × 60 mm (5.0 × 3.7 × 2.4 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $860; check current price\n\nThe Nikon Z50 is a 21-megapixel “upper entry level” mirrorless camera with surprisingly good specifications. It shoots 11 frames per second stills as well as 4K video, and it has eye-tracking autofocus (including some animal eyes) for portraits and wildlife photography. However, it lacks a few features found on Nikon’s more advanced mirrorless cameras, such as dual card slots, in-body image stabilization, and an AF-On button – and, of course, it has the smaller DX sensor. Read our Nikon Z50 review for more.\n\nNikon Zfc\n\nAnnounced: June 2021\n\nSensor size: DX\n\nResolution: 20.9 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 209-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 11 FPS\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Fully articulating touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 30p\n\nBattery life: 300 photos\n\nControl layout: Retro\n\nMemory cards: 1 SD (UHS-I compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 445 g (0.98 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 135 × 94 × 44 mm (5.3 × 3.7 × 1.7 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $960; check current price\n\nThe Nikon Zfc has almost identical specifications to the Nikon Z50, but it’s built around a retro-themed design. It does add a few new features, such as the fully articulating rear LCD (as opposed to the tilt-only LCD on the Z50) and eye autofocus in video. But the main reason to choose one of these cameras over the other is because of which design you prefer. (We have a full Nikon Zfc vs Nikon Z50 article if you want to analyze their more minor differences.) It’s hard to go wrong with either camera, but the extra controls and articulating screen on the Nikon Zfc will justify the extra $100 for a lot of photographers, even if the styling differences are irrelevant to you.\n\nNikon Z30\n\nAnnounced: June 2022\n\nSensor size: DX\n\nResolution: 20.9 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 209-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 11 FPS\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Tilt-flip touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840 × 2160 (4K) at 30 FPS; 1080p at 120 FPS\n\nBattery life: 330 photos\n\nControl layout: Basic\n\nMemory cards: 1 SD (UHS-I compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 405 g (0.89 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 128 × 74 × 60 mm (5.0 × 2.9 × 2.4 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $710; check current price\n\nThe newest consumer-level Nikon Z camera is the Z30. Nikon says it’s aimed at vloggers and on-the-go video shooters, although frankly most of its video features are borrowed from the existing Z50. (Most of its stills features are, too.)\n\nThe Z30 is very similar to the Nikon Z50, except it lacks a viewfinder and was announced more than 2.5 years later. Given that, I’d have expected more than a $150 price difference between them. Frankly, the Z30 should be priced about $500 based on its features and timing. Or it should have gained higher-end video features like 10-bit recording, 4:2:2 sampling, and N-log if Nikon wanted to seriously target it at video users.\n\nNevertheless, if you want Nikon’s least expensive mirrorless camera and don’t mind the missing viewfinder, the Z30 is the way to go.\n\nFX (Full Frame) Cameras\n\nNikon Z5\n\nAnnounced: July 2020\n\nSensor size: FX\n\nResolution: 24.3 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 273-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 4.5 FPS\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 30p, but with a 1.7x crop\n\nBattery life: 470 photos\n\nControl layout: Advanced\n\nMemory cards: 2 SD (UHS-II compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 675 g (1.49 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 134 × 101 × 70 mm (5.3 × 4.0 × 2.8 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $1400; check current price\n\nThe Z5 is the least expensive full-frame Nikon Z camera at the moment, and it’s a really excellent value. Even though the starting price is $1400, I’ve seen it go on sale for $1000 at times (body only) which isn’t much more expensive than a DX camera. It lacks the high frame rate of most Nikon Z cameras and uses a slightly older generation 24.3 megapixel sensor, but it still has excellent full-frame image quality. The Nikon Z5 is our top recommendation for first-time Nikon Z shooters on a budget. It’s much better to get this camera with a good lens than a more expensive camera with a bad lens. Read our Nikon Z5 review for more.\n\nNikon Z6\n\nAnnounced: August 2018\n\nSensor size: FX\n\nResolution: 24.5 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 273-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 12 FPS (12-bit RAW), 9 FPS (14-bit RAW)\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 30p\n\nBattery life: 310 photos\n\nControl layout: Professional\n\nMemory cards: 1 XQD\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 675 g (23.8 oz)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 134 × 101 × 68 mm (5.3 × 4.0 × 2.7 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $1800; now discontinued in most markets. Check used price.\n\nThe Nikon Z6 (along with the Z7) was the first Z-series camera ever announced, back in August of 2018. It still has very impressive specifications today, including up to 12 FPS shooting and Nikon’s newest 24.5 megapixel sensor. However, it’s showing its age in a few areas, hence the release of a Nikon Z6 II in late 2020.\n\nEven in 2024, the Nikon Z6 makes for a great budget camera. It’s hard to find new any longer, but prices on the used market have fallen to excellent levels in recent years. Read our Nikon Z6 review for more.\n\nNikon Z7\n\nAnnounced: August 2018\n\nSensor size: FX\n\nResolution: 45.7 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 493-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 9 FPS (12-bit RAW), 8 FPS (14-bit RAW)\n\nBase ISO: 64\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 30p\n\nBattery life: 330 photos\n\nControl layout: Professional\n\nMemory cards: 1 XQD\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 675 g (23.8 oz)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 134 × 101 × 68 mm (5.3 × 4.0 × 2.7 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $3000; now discontinued in most markets. Check used price.\n\nAnnounced alongside the Nikon Z6, the Nikon Z7 is a very similar camera in almost every way, except it has a higher resolution sensor (45 megapixels rather than 24) and a lower base ISO (64 rather than 100). The point of these changes is to allow for the highest possible image quality if using the camera with a sharp lens.\n\nHowever, if you’re happy with 24 megapixels and ISO 100, you can get practically the identical camera for hundreds of dollars less by buying the Z6 instead. (The Z6 even has a faster frame rate of 12 FPS rather than 9 FPS to boot.) Read our Nikon Z7 review for more.\n\nNikon Z6 II\n\nAnnounced: October 2020\n\nSensor size: FX\n\nResolution: 24.5 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 273-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 14 FPS (12-bit RAW), 10 FPS (14-bit RAW)\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 60p\n\nBattery life: 340 photos\n\nControl layout: Professional\n\nMemory cards: 1 CF Express, 1 SD (UHS-II compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 705 g (1.55 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 134 × 101 × 70 mm (5.3 × 4.0 × 2.8 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $2000; check current price\n\nThe Nikon Z6 II fixes some of the biggest complaints about the first-generation Z6. The biggest changes are the addition of a second memory card slot, a higher frame rate, and 4K 60p video recording. It also has plenty of smaller, behind-the-scenes fixes that I appreciate, like the option for a clutter-free display in live view and a fix for the Z6’s oversensitive eye sensor for the viewfinder.\n\nStill, the Nikon Z6 II is more expensive than the original Z6, especially on the used market. So, it’s all about what improvements you’re willing to pay for or not. Read our Nikon Z6 II review for more.\n\nNikon Z7 II\n\nAnnounced: October 2020\n\nSensor size: FX\n\nResolution: 45.7 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 493-point hybrid PDAF\n\nFrame rate: 10 FPS (12-bit RAW), 9 FPS (14-bit RAW)\n\nBase ISO: 64\n\nLCD type: Tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 60p\n\nBattery life: 360 photos\n\nControl layout: Professional\n\nMemory cards: 1 CF Express, 1 SD (UHS-II compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 705 g (1.55 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 134 × 101 × 70 mm (5.3 × 4.0 × 2.8 in.)\n\nPrice at launch: $3000; check current price\n\nOur next camera is the Nikon Z7 II – no surprise, a camera that mimics the Z6 II, but with a higher-resolution sensor. All of the same behind-the-scenes improvements that I talked about on the Z6 II are also present on the Z7 II.\n\nThe only major differences between the Z6 II and Z7 II are frame rate (in favor of the Z6 II), base ISO (in favor of the Z7 II), high ISO performance (in favor of the Z6 II), and resolution (in favor of the Z7 II). Read our Nikon Z7 II review for more.\n\nNikon Z9\n\nAnnounced: October 2021\n\nResolution: 45.7 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 493-point hybrid PDAF with deep learning and 9-subject classification\n\nFrame rate: 20 FPS (RAW), 30 FPS (JPEG), 120 FPS (11-megapixel JPEG)\n\nBase ISO: 64\n\nLCD type: Dual axis tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 7680×4320 (8k), 30p (will be 60p with a firmware update this year)\n\nBattery life: 700 photos\n\nControl layout: Top tier professional\n\nMemory cards: Two CF Express B (XQD backwards compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 1340 g (2.95 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 149 × 149.5 × 90.5 mm (5.9 × 5.9 × 3.6 inches)\n\nPrice at launch: $5500; check current price\n\nThe Nikon Z9 is one of the most advanced cameras ever made, and not just by Nikon. Many expected that with such advanced specifications – particularly the blackout-free 20 FPS shooting at 45 megapixels – the camera would cost at least $6000 and probably more.\n\nInstead, Nikon launched it at $5500, the company’s lowest price in recent memory for their flagship camera. The Z9 is heavier than a typical mirrorless camera, but with these features, it arguably beats every other camera on the market today. Read more in our full Nikon Z9 review.\n\nNikon Z8\n\nAnnounced: May 2023\n\nResolution: 45.7 megapixels\n\nAutofocus system: 493-point hybrid PDAF with deep learning and 9-subject classification\n\nFrame rate: 20 FPS (RAW), 30 FPS (JPEG), 120 FPS (11-megapixel JPEG)\n\nBase ISO: 64\n\nLCD type: Dual axis tilting touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 7680×4320 (8k), 60p\n\nBattery life: 330 photos\n\nControl layout: Professional\n\nMemory cards: CF Express B (XQD backwards compatible) and SD (UHS-II Compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 910 g (2.01 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 144 x 119 x 88 mm (5.7 x 4.7 x 3.5 inches)\n\nPrice at launch: $4000; check current price\n\nThe Z8 is one of Nikon’s most impressive cameras. Not only does it have essentially all the features of the Z9 except for the grip, it is $1500 cheaper than the Z9. It’s an action and wildlife powerhouse in a small package and would be idea for anyone who needs fast autofocus. Like the Z9, it features a blackout-free viewfinder and an insane autofocus system that can handle anything. I would recommend the Z8 as a first choice to any Nikon shooter who needs fast autofocus and does not mind the absence of the built-in grip and slightly lower battery life compared to the Z9.\n\nNikon Zf\n\nAnnounced: September 2023\n\nResolution: 24.5 megapixels (96 megapixels in sensor-shift mode)\n\nAutofocus system: 273-point hybrid PDAF with deep learning and 9-subject classification\n\nFrame rate: 14 FPS (12-bit RAW)\n\nBase ISO: 100\n\nLCD type: Fully articulating touchscreen\n\nMax video specs: 3840×2160 (4k), 60p\n\nBattery life: 360 photos\n\nControl layout: Retro\n\nMemory cards: 1 SD (UHS-II compatible), 1 Micro SD (UHS-I compatible)\n\nWeight w/ battery and card: 710 g (1.57 lbs)\n\nDimensions (W×H×D): 144 x 103 x 59 mm (5.7 x 4.1 x 2.3 inches)\n\nPrice at launch: $2000; check current price\n\nAlthough many of these specifications look similar to the Nikon Z6 II, despite the Zf being three years newer, there are some major reasons to get the Zf instead. It has a 96-megapixel sensor-shift mode with full RGB data. It has a more advanced image stabilization system than any previous Nikon camera, up to 8 stops (compared to 5 stops on the Z6 II).\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the Zf’s the autofocus system is also far more advanced, borrowing the subject-tracking algorithms from the Nikon Z8 and Z9. You can read about additional differences in our Nikon Z6 II vs Nikon Zf comparison. In short, the Nikon Zf is a great camera that is very competitively priced at $2000.\n\nNikon Z-Series Lenses\n\nDX Lenses\n\nNikon’s DX lenses have a smaller image circle intended for DX cameras like the Z30, Z50, and Zfc. These lenses can still technically mount on the FX cameras, although your camera will automatically crop all your photos 1.5x when you do so, in order to avoid black corners. In general, I recommend using these lenses only on a DX camera.\n\nDX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR: The only wide-angle lens available for Nikon Z DX cameras so far, aside from third-party or adapted lenses. For that reason, it’s a no-brainer for landscape and architectural photography. It’s nice and cheap at $360. Check current price.\n\nDX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR: A standard kit lens covering the usual wide to slight telephoto focal lengths, but in an extremely lightweight package. We were more impressed with this lens than we expected, and even though there are better Nikon Z lenses out there, this one is a good introduction to the system. $300 at release; check current price. Can be $160 cheaper when bought as a kit with a camera. See our 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 review for more.\n\nDX 18-140mm f/3.5-6.3 VR: Another standard zoom, although this one goes to a much longer focal length of 140mm. It’s in the style of Nikon’s many 18-XXmm lenses for their DX DSLRs. At $600, it’s not the cheapest lens, but it may be the only one you’d need as a Nikon Z DX user. Check current price and read our Nikon Z 18-140mm review.\n\nDX 24mm f/1.7: A great choice for Nikon’s DX users who want a lightweight lens, with a popular (roughly) 35mm full-frame equivalent focal length. The maximum aperture of f/1.7 is bright enough to make it easy to shoot in low light. Hopefully Nikon releases a longer version in the 50mm-60mm range for portraiture. For $280, it’s not a bad deal. Check current price.\n\nDX 50-250mm f/4.5-6.3 VR: A lightweight telephoto DX zoom to complement the 16-50mm kit lens. It’s also not optically perfect but works surprisingly well and gets the job done. $350 at release; check current price. Can be $150 cheaper when bought as a kit with a camera. See our 50-250mm f/4.5-6.3 review for more.\n\nFX Lenses\n\nNikon’s FX lenses have a larger imaging circle that covers the entire full frame (FX) camera sensor. They also mount on Nikon’s DX cameras without any issues. In fact, we encourage Nikon DX users to consider these lenses, since the dedicated DX lineup is somewhat limited at the moment.\n\n14-24mm f/2.8 S: One of the best ultra-wide angle lenses we’ve ever tested at Photography Life. It has no significant optical flaws at all, and it’s very light for the type of lens at 650 g / 1.43 pounds. It takes native 112mm filters that attach via the HB-97 lens hood. $2200 at release; check current price. See our 14-24mm f/2.8 review for more.\n\n14-30mm f/4 S: Nikon’s other ultra-wide Z-series zoom. It’s lighter, smaller, and less expensive than the 14-24mm f/2.8, and it takes standard 82mm filters. Our tests showed that it’s optically a very good lens but not at the otherworldly level of the 14-24mm f/2.8 S. $1300 at release; check current price. See our 14-30mm f/4 review for more.\n\n17-28mm f/2.8: This lens is optically based on the Tamron 17-28mm f/2.8 Di III RXD, originally a Sony E-mount lens. It performed better than I expected in my 17-28mm f/2.8 review. At $1200 (check current price), it’s a bit less expensive than the Nikon Z 14-30mm f/4 S, although it doesn’t have quite as large of a zoom range.\n\n20mm f/1.8 S: All of Nikon’s Z-series primes that we’ve tested have been outstanding in image quality, although most of them are more expensive than their F-mount counterparts (and most are about the same weight or slightly heavier). The 20mm f/1.8 S is no exception; it’s remarkably sharp and has almost no coma, making it an excellent choice for astrophotography. $1050 at release; check current price. See our 20mm f/1.8 review for more.\n\n24mm f/1.8 S: Similar to the Nikon Z 20mm f/1.8 in optical performance – which is to say, almost flawless. If you’re choosing between these two lenses, the most meaningful difference is which focal length you prefer: 20mm or 24mm. $1000 at release; check current price. See our 24mm f/1.8 review for more.\n\n24-50mm f/4-6.3: The most middling optical quality of the full-frame Nikon Z lenses at the moment. It’s an inexpensive, ultralight lens, so it does have an audience, but we tend to recommend other options instead if you’re willing to spend a bit extra. $400 at release; check current price. Can be $100 cheaper if bought as a kit with a camera. See our 24-50mm f/4-6.3 review for more.\n\n24-70mm f/2.8 S: Nikon’s highest-end midrange zoom. In many ways, it continues what the Nikon Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S started: excellent performance with a constant f/2.8 aperture to capture a lot of light. It’s noticeably heavier and more expensive than Nikon’s other Z-series midrange zooms, though. $2300 at release; check current price. See our 24-70mm f/2.8 review for more.\n\n24-70mm f/4 S: The first Nikon Z lens ever released; a kit lens that beats almost all other kit lenses. While this lens does have a few optical issues compared to the 24-70mm f/2.8 S, it’s much lighter and less expensive without falling too far behind. This lens (or the next one below) is our top recommendation for a Nikon Z shooter’s first piece of glass. $1000 at release; check current price. Can be $400 cheaper if bought as a kit with a camera. See our 24-70mm f/4 review for more.\n\n24-120mm f/4 S: A longer alternative to the 24-70mm f/4, although heavier and more expensive, too. This lens pairs well with Nikon’s ultra-wide 14-30mm f/4 and 20mm f/1.8 lenses, at which point you’ll have most of the important focal lengths covered. We’ve reviewed the 24-120mm f/4 S in full. $1100 at release; check current price.\n\n24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR: The best superzoom we’ve ever tested – but still a superzoom. Nikon Z shooters who want maximum convenience and minimal weight should take a long look at the 24-200mm. Optically, it is the second weakest Nikon Z lens (only beating the 24-50mm) but it makes up for that in how useful it is. This is the lens I personally chose for my landscape and travel photography on the Nikon Z system, alongside the 14-30mm f/4. $900 at release; check current price. Can be $100 cheaper if bought as a kit with a camera. See our 24-200mm f/4-6.3 review for more.\n\n26mm f/2.8: It’s a full-frame lens with very similar top-line specifications as the 28mm f/2.8 below, although it’s about half the size. It’s a more expensive lens, however, at $500. After reviewing it, I can confirm that this extra cost is pretty unnecessary – it’s not a better lens than the Z 28mm f/2.8. Check current price.\n\n28mm f/2.8: This is the first of Nikon’s “compact” series of prime lenses for the Z system. It certainly is very lightweight (160 g / 0.35 lbs) and pretty inexpensive ($300 on its own and $250 as a kit with the Nikon Zfc). This is a good first lens for Nikon Z shooters. It comes in optically identical “standard” and “special edition” versions which simply have different external designs. Check the current price here. I’ve also reviewed the 28mm f/2.8 here.\n\n28-75mm f/2.8: This lens is optically identical to the Tamron G1 28-75mm f/2.8, which is a decent and inexpensive f/2.8 zoom for mirrorless cameras. It’s also lightweight at just 565 g / 1.25 pounds. However, the Nikon-branded version is more expensive than the original Tamron ($1200 vs $880). It’s also a non-S lens, signifying a lower-end optic than Nikon’s other f/2.8 zooms. Check current price and read my Nikon Z 28-75mm f/2.8 review.\n\n28-400mm f/4-8: Not designed to be a sharpness powerhouse, but still surprisingly good optically. It has a wider zoom range than any full-frame lens made before it. However, this comes with an aperture compromise – the maximum of f/8 (which kicks in around 200mm) isn’t that bright. Check the price here or read our 28-400mm f/4-8 review.\n\n35mm f/1.8 S: One of the first Nikon Z lenses, and a very good one. It continues the trend of the 20mm f/1.8 and 24mm f/1.8 primes with excellent optical performance in almost every way. $850 at release; check current price. See our 35mm f/1.8 review for more.\n\n40mm f/2: An ultralight compact lens, and also a budget option at $300. This lens makes a great pair with the 24-200mm f/4-6.3, since it has a substantially larger maximum aperture and fits into the bag with ease. There’s an identical 40mm f/2 SE or “Special Edition” that has the same optics but a retro-looking exterior. See my full Nikon Z 40mm f/2 review for more. The lens occasionally goes on sale; check the current price.\n\n50mm f/1.2 S: A high-end portraiture lens with a price and weight that match. Although this is one of Nikon’s sharpest lenses ever, it is a much more niche lens than the 50mm f/1.8 below. The large maximum aperture of f/1.2 lets in more than twice as much light as f/1.8, though. $2100 at release; check current price.\n\n50mm f/1.8 S: Nikon’s mirrorless version of the “nifty fifty,” with modern optics and a higher price than usual. It’s not like this is a terribly expensive lens at $600, but compared to Nikon’s historical 50mm f/1.8 lenses (such as the $220 Nikon 50mm f/1.8G for the F-mount DSLR system), it does stand out a bit. It also stands out in image quality; this is one impressive lens. $600 at release; check current price. See our 50mm f/1.8 review for more.\n\n50mm f/2.8 Macro: A macro lens with a so-so 50mm focal length but an ultralight design. We are currently testing this lens and will report our findings soon, but for Nikon Z shooters wanting a lightweight 50mm lens that can do close-ups, it’s a good one to consider. However, for true 1:1 macro photography, a 50mm lens isn’t going to be long enough for most photographers. You need to be very close to your subject, to the point that you’ll be blocking the light and potentially scaring it away. $650 at release; check current price.\n\n58mm f/0.95 S Noct: An ultra-niche manual focus prime lens with one of the fastest apertures on the market. This lens is not for the faint of heart. It’s 2000 g / 4.4 lbs and costs $8000. The f/0.95 maximum aperture lets in about 2/3 of a stop more light than an f/1.2 lens like Nikon’s 50mm f/1.2 S. It’s one of Nikon’s highest-end lenses ever with top tier optical quality. $8000 at release; check current price.\n\n70-180mm f/2.8: It’s a Tamron-designed lens, but a good one. This is a compelling alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S below, both in price and weight. It’s not actually sharper, but it’s good enough for most photographers and only costs $1250. Check current price.\n\n70-200mm f/2.8 VR S: The single sharpest zoom lens we have ever tested – ideal for wildlife and sports photography. It completes the “f/2.8 trio” alongside the 14-24mm f/2.8 S and 24-70mm f/2.8 S.Nikon prioritized image quality more than weight with this lens (it’s about as heavy as the older F-mount 70-200mm f/2.8E for Nikon DSLRs). $2600 at release; check current price. See our 70-200mm f/2.8 review for more.\n\n85mm f/1.2 S: A high-end, portrait-oriented prime lens with an extremely wide maximum aperture of f/1.2. Wedding photographers will salivate over this lens, although the high price of $2800 (check current price) makes it hard to justify if you’re on a budget. See our 85mm f/1.2 review.\n\n85mm f/1.8 S: Another stellar entry in Nikon’s f/1.8 prime lens lineup for the Z series. This lens is an excellent focal length for portraiture, and it can also double as a relatively small and lightweight telephoto for landscape photography thanks to its high sharpness. Pair this lens with any of the wider f/1.8 lenses for a good travel kit, too. $800 at release; check current price. See our 85mm f/1.8 review for more.\n\n100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 VR S: This is Nikon’s first supertelephoto zoom for the Z system, and it’s a big one. At $2700, it’s even more expensive than the exceptional 70-200mm f/2.8, so you should make sure you need the 400mm focal length before you buy this lens (and don’t want to use a 2x teleconverter on the 70-200mm f/2.8 to get it). Check current price. See our Nikon Z 100-400mm review for more.\n\n105mm f/2.8 Macro VR S: A high-end macro photography lens with excellent image quality. It’s a slightly bulkier lens than some photographers were hoping for, but it’s otherwise essentially perfect – no optical flaws or handling issues at all. $1000 at release; check current price. In our Nikon Z 105mm f/2.8 MC review, we gave it a perfect 5.0/5.0 stars.\n\n135mm f/1.8 S Plena: Nikon gave this lens a label (“Plena,” referencing “a fullness of space”), so you know it’s good! And it sure is. Optically speaking, this is perhaps the highest-quality lens that Nikon has ever made. It costs $2500 (check current price). You can read our full Nikon Z 135mm f/1.8 Plena review here.\n\n180-600mm f/5.6-6.3 VR: For most Nikon shooters, this will be the default supertelephoto zoom for any situation. It is the mirrorless successor to the well-known Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6 lens and would be the ideal replacement for it. If you need more than 400mm in a zoom lens, this is the lens for you. Check current price or read our extensive Z 180-600mm review.\n\n400mm f/2.8 TC VR S: One of the highest-end lenses Nikon has ever made. It’s an exotic supertelephoto with a custom built-in 1.4x teleconverter. (The lens is still compatible with Nikon’s two separate teleconverters for the Z system.) It’s optically flawless and focuses extremely fast. But at $14,000, it’s quite a commitment. Check current price. Read our Nikon Z 400mm f/2.8 TC VR S review here.\n\n400mm f/4.5 VR S: A lightweight supertelephoto lens meant to be paired with Nikon’s 1.4x teleconverter (to give you a 560mm f/6.3). Even though it’s not a PF (phase fresnel) lens, it weighs less than the comparable Nikon 500mm f/5.6 PF, including when the 400mm has the teleconverter attached. Check current price and availability. Read our 400mm f/4.5 review for more.\n\n600mm f/4 TC VR S: Arguably the highest-end Nikon Z lens so far, with a price tag to match ($15,500 MSRP). The built-in 1.4x teleconverter is custom-made for the lens, turning it into an 840mm f/5.6. As with many of Nikon’s supertelephotos for the Z system, availability is limited. Check current price and availability or read our full review of the 600mm f/4 TC VR S.\n\n600mm f/6.3 VR S PF: A seriously lightweight lens (at least considering the focal length and maximum aperture), but not a cheap one at $4800. Although the 180-600mm f/5.6-6.3 arguably has a wider appeal, especially considering its price of just $1700, photographers who want the utmost portability at 600mm should strongly consider it. Check current price and availability.\n\n800mm f/6.3 VR S PF: Nikon’s longest Z-series lens at the moment, and also one of the most surprising. It’s a PF lens, making it much lighter than expected at 2.4 kilos / 5.2 pounds. Nikon also released it at a historically low price of $6500. It will be in demand (and out of stock) for a long time, although you can read my full review to tide you over. Check current price and availability.\n\n1.4x Teleconverter: A standard 1.4x teleconverter that does the job. You lose one stop of light with this teleconverter, turning an f/2.8 lens into an f/4, or an f/5.6 lens into an f/8. It has a slight image quality penalty as well, as shown in my review. $550 at release; check current price.\n\n2.0x Teleconverter: Similar to the other teleconverter, but with 2x increase in focal length (and a loss of two stops of light). It turns an f/2.8 lens into an f/5.6, and an f/6.3 lens into an f/13. This teleconverter has a bit more of an image quality penalty than the other but is still easily sharp enough for professional use according to our tests. $600 at release; check current price.\n\nUnreleased Lenses\n\nThanks to Nikon’s mirrorless roadmap and a couple development announcements, we also have information about one other Nikon Z lens that has yet to be released. It’s going to be a 35mm S lens. No details are known, but I strongly suspect it will be an f/1.2 lens.\n\nNikon Z Official Accessories\n\nAlong with the cameras and lenses above, Nikon has some other products and accessories meant specifically for the Nikon Z system. Those are as follows:\n\nFTZ and FTZ II Adapters: A necessary accessory for photographers who want to use any Nikon F-mount DSLR lenses (of which there are hundreds available) on a Nikon Z camera. Even if you’re a first-time Nikon Z shooter, an FTZ adapter can expand the lenses at your disposal – everything from old manual focus gems to top-tier F-mount glass like the 28mm f/1.4E. However, it does have some compatibility issues as we have detailed before. The FTZ II works exactly the same as the original FTZ adapter, but it lacks the protrusion at the bottom with the tripod socket. I recommend the FTZ II, which is ergonomically better of the two. The tripod socket is unnecessary.\n\nMB-N10 Battery Grip: The least-loved accessory in Nikon’s lineup today. It’s a $200 battery pack with no special controls and very few features; it allows you to use up to two total EN-EL15 batteries on your Z camera at a time, roughly doubling your battery life. But most photographers would be better off bringing an extra battery or two in a pouch and saving some money (and weight). This grip is compatible with the Nikon Z5, Z6, Z7, Z6 II, and Z7 II.\n\nMB-N11 Battery Grip: A proper battery grip with vertical controls and the necessary connections to communicate with your camera. It costs $400 and is compatible with the Nikon Z6 II and Z7 II.\n\nMB-N12 Battery Grip: Also a proper grip, this one dedicated to the Nikon Z8. It costs $350 last I checked.\n\nCamera Straps: Nikon has designed a few camera straps for its Z cameras so far, and although they’re technically compatible with almost any camera on the market, the straps do say “Nikon Z” on them in big letters. The official strap for the Nikon Z5, Z6, Z7, Z6 II, and Z7 II is called the AN-DC19. The official strap for the Nikon Z50 is called the AN-DC20. The official strap for the Nikon Zfc is called the AN-DC23. The Z9’s strap is the AN-DC24. The Z30’s strap is the AN-DC25. The Z8’s strap is the AN-DC26. The Zf’s strap is the AN-DC27.\n\nBags: Nikon makes a couple bags that they market specifically for Nikon Z shooters, although obviously any camera that fits in the bag is perfectly compatible with it. The first is a shoulder bag called the Travel Kit (which comes in four colors: lemon, coral, sky, and charcoal). It costs $60 and is listed as compatible with only the Nikon Z30, Z50, and Zfc – though it’s certainly large enough for a Z6-sized-camera. The second bag, called the CF-DC9, is more like a small pouch that you may throw into a backpack for some padding. It costs $32 and is listed as compatible only with the Z5, Z6, Z7, Z6 II, and Z7 II – though it obviously fits the Z50 and Zfc as well.\n\nBatteries and Chargers: The Nikon Z30, Z50, and Zfc are the only Nikon cameras at the moment to use the EN-EL25 battery. The charger for this battery is called the MH-32. The Nikon Z9 uses the large EN-EL18d battery and MH-33 charger. The other Z Series cameras use EN-EL15 type batteries and the MH-25a or MH-34 battery chargers.\n\nRubber Eyecup Replacements: The compatible eyecup for the Nikon Z5, Z6, Z7, Z6 II, and Z7 II is called the DK-29. The compatible eyecup for the Nikon Z50 is called the DK-30. The compatible eyecup for the Nikon Zfc is called the DK-32. The eyecup for the Z8, Z9, and Zf is the DK-33.\n\nBody Cap: The Nikon Z body cap is the BF-N1.\n\nSoft Shutter Release: The Nikon AR-11 is a $30 soft shutter release that only works for the Zf. It screws directly into the Zf’s shutter button.\n\nCountry-Specific Accessories: There are some specialized accessories only sold in a few countries (usually Japan) such as the Z-GR1 extension platform, a handgrip for the Nikon Zfc, and some specialized hotshoe covers.\n\nThere are also a number of lens-specific accessories such as replacement caps, cases, and lens hoods. You can find the full list here if you need a replacement. I only included accessories in the list above if they are exclusively meant for Nikon Z cameras. Plenty of Nikon’s other accessories are compatible with the Z cameras as well as some DSLRs or point-and-shoot cameras. That list is below:\n\nRemote Releases\n\nWR-1: Wireless radio remote controller; transmitter or receiver.
