From my limited experience in China, I am pretty sure manufacturing capabilities there are equal to the state of the art.

Individual lines from individual manufacturers can have wildly different glass. Country of origin is no guarantee of warm or cool colors, saturation, or CA.\n\nWhere the glass is made isn't a huge deal, but you can figure if it's Japanese or German it'll be good. Leupold had to change their \"made in USA\" because they order Japanese glass. So they're assembled and all the metal and plastic parts are made here, with glass they order to spec.\n\nI think the big thing is the Japanese always want to do things efficiently and very precisely. Lots of pride. So they're ready to go on cost effective good glass.\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#17\n\nCould just be my opinion but I reckon German glass will hold more value used than Japanese will. Not sure whether that's just the perception of it compared to Jap glass but it generally seems to be the case.\n\nNov 8, 2020\n\n#19\n\nAs a general rule, german/EU glass is better.\n\n... we have to talk about \"dollar for dollar\"\n\njust to make this a discussion.\n\nThe next question, is how many dollars? and what are they worth?\n\nIf you are looking at rifle optics, ±$2K japanese\n\nis professional grade and will do the job IMHO.\n\n$3500 is better, and all that, but that $1,500 can\n\nbuy you other stuff...\n\nEG some nice swaro binos or leica LRF.\n\nSo if you don't have these things, saving $$ can make a difference.\n\nEven if you do have these things, $1500 for another investment,\n\nEG class//ammo/range time/training...also can make a difference...\n\nWhich difference is bigger?

The scope makers mix and match the optical qualities they need for whatever scope they are designing. If they are making a higher priced scope, then they order a higher quality spec.

Do you mean the actual origin of raw glass? or origin of ground and polished lens elements? or origin of partially-integrated optomechanical subsystems? or the final assembly place of the actual product? or where the product is put into the box and documentation is printed?\n\nSometimes, these are all different.\n\nThanks\n\nILya\n\nNov 10, 2020\n\n#35\n\nPersonally I would say they're both good.\n\nLook at where some of the best cnc machines are from.

There are very few actual manufacturers. Schott is big in Europe, Low in Japan, and some japanese companies like Nikon are building plants in the Phillippines.\n\nI think most US glass makers do fiber optics for networks instead of optical like Corning, or others just specialize in Window glass. I think Schott opened a US factory, but I dont consider that US. Based on shipping records, most scope glass ships from Europe or Asia, with China and Japan in the lead, and then Austria. I think Meopta is Czech republic.\n\nAll that being said, you MUST look through it to make a decision. Only YOUR eyes will tell you which is best. As an example, I have found an obscure chinese company that markets their scopes with Schott HD glass, with a 34mm 6-30x56 going for around $800 having MUCH clearer and brighter glass than many other vendors in the $2000-3000 range. To MY eyes. I have about 5 of those now, and they are my range toys. I have come to find that what it really comes down to is the freaking reticle. You have to love the reticle, or why bother. From that perspective, I would take a Primary Arms ACSS over an S&B any day. Dimitri is a genius with making easy to use reticles. The PA Platinum with LOW glass will be my next scope, even though my chinese scopes have better glass and are half the price.\n\nReactions: Drew890\n\nNov 11, 2020\n\n#38\n\nTake a look at all the articles under \"Research\" at http://www.revicoptics.com/\n\nIt will be time well spent.\n\nNov 12, 2020\n\n#39\n\nI’ll bite..\n\nmost of the glass you see is actually made in China.\n\nThey also make the majority of polishing equipment.\n\nit’s more about the coatings and how many different coatings are the actual glass.\n\ntop of the line scopes...there is no difference.\n\nbuy what your eye likes\n\nothers a lot more knowledgeable than I will chime in but that’s some basics.\n\nI personally don’t care where the scope comes from, what glass, who uses it etc\n\nit has to look good to me, have a ret that I like, and track perfect.\n\nif you dial and it’s not consistent, the best glass in the world will only allow you to spot your misses easier.\n\nsounds logical to me.\n\nNov 12, 2020\n\n#40\n\nOne way to find out where glass comes from is to research shipping logistics online, to see where the scope vendors get their glass from.

And when did Nikon start building plants in the Phillipines?\n\nAlso, when you talk about $800 scopes being better than $2000-$3000 scopes, you should really be specific, since that is a very bold claim. I vaguely recall you were posting about Vector scopes, so I assume that is the $800 one. Which $2000-$3000 ones are you are talking about?\n\nILya\n\nNov 12, 2020\n\n#41\n\nI'm not expert but... I have high end optics from: S&B, NF, March, Kahles, Vortex (Golden Eagle), Leupold, Revic, and probably others I'm forgetting right now. The best - very best - advice you will get on optics is what Rimfire Joe said: \"buy what your eye likes\". As long as the parallax works well for you, as well as the eye relief and reticle, buy it (if it is in your price range). No optic is perfect, and no optic is perfect for everyone and every situation. And as far as I'm concerned, the very best Schott glass is one filled with great tequila, which will provide more clarity and depth to things than the best scope ever built....\n\nNov 14, 2020\n\n#44\n\nyou can get a bunch of the best quality \"glass\", stick it in a scope and get a mediocre optical end result. There's a ton of optical engineering know-how that matches and positions the lenses to squeeze the best performance from the collective glass, that can have a bigger impact than its' country of origin. Whom is putting the scope together is as important as the glass...\n\nLast edited: Nov 14, 2020\n\nReactions: 308pirate\n\nNov 14, 2020\n\n#45\n\nUhhh, just cause nobody else has pointed it out, I'm pretty sure they changed the spelling to 'Kronus'.\n\nIm a fact checker from planet fact chek.

I have looked through many different brands at the range, friends, stores (B&H photo in NYC and with Doug at CameralandNY), and I cannot tell the difference between this $800 scope and the much more expensive ones. This is supposedly German glass.\n\nAttachments\n\n20201027_122035.jpg\n\nNov 14, 2020\n\n#48\n\nI cannot tell the difference between this $800 scope and the much more expensive ones.\n\n.\n\nIf you can't tell an apple from an orange, its fine. Maybe you're just looking for a piece of fruit for lunch.\n\nNov 14, 2020\n\n#49\n\nCould just be my opinion but I reckon German glass will hold more value used than Japanese will.\n\nIf cars are any indication to go by, you would be wrong.\n\nGo look at how fast a $45000 German car depreciates compared to a premium Japanese car.......\n\nReactions: NiteQwill"
