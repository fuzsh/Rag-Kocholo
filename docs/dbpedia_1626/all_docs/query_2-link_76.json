        "text": "The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 camera was introduced last year, bringing a new level of freedom and production creativity to the market. It is one of the only devices out there where the term “pocket” accurately reflects its true nature regarding portability. Top this with a 1-inch sensor size, a built-in gimbal, a nice bright adjusting screen, long battery life with the possibility of extension, and boosted audio performance when using it with the DJI Mic 2. Are we looking at the best traveling/family/vlogging camera out there? Let’s dive into it and find out. Here’s my full review!\n\nIn this article and video review, I want to leave aside the “pro features” of the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 camera. Even if only to make a point, I might come back to it in the future or produce a mini-documentary solely filmed with this camera. But this time, not a word about Pro Mode, D-Log, 10-bit recording, or anything else that comes close to putting this device in a situation that requires “control.” This is all about ease of use, mobility, functionality, fun, and out-of-the-box picture quality.\n\nLet’s start with a bold statement: “I would like to thank DJI for saving my marriage.” Please don’t take me too seriously here, but if you are someone’s spouse and/or parent, you might recognize yourself in the following scenario and know exactly what I mean.\n\nAs a camera junkie and a person who has been committed to bringing “true to life camera reviews” for years, I have been shlepping DSLR and, later, mirrorless cameras with me wherever I go, including family vacations and trips. The box of excuses was always full. From “I have to meet a deadline for testing this camera” to “I have to capture those priceless family memories.” These are all true statements, but at what cost?\n\nWhatever the scenario or excuse, one thing hasn’t changed: the little irritation that my wife and kids have while I point a camera at them or lag behind them searching for that “best vacation shot.”\n\nSo, how is this all connected to the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 camera? Well, here we go.\n\nA family vacation is around the corner. What camera should I take?\n\nAs some of you might know, the amazing Japan is my second home, and as such, every year my family and I spend the summer months here. At the beginning of our stay, we dedicate a few days to having a family vacation, and there is ALWAYS a new camera to test (hint: a LUMIX GH7 review is currently in the making).\n\nFor this vacation, I wanted it to be seamless. I didn’t want the kids to pose or hear anyone complaining about me lagging behind. As a mirrorless camera advocate, the Osmo Pocket 3 was not really on my radar, but this time, I wanted to take a closer look at it, and let me tell you, since then, I’ve been hooked.\n\nDJI Osmo Pocket 3 review – good morning sunshine\n\nIn all the years of testing cameras, I had never experienced a filming device that did not disturb but rather complemented and supported a vacation (yes, this also goes for comparing it with mobile phones). The overall handling and ease of use were something that I did not expect at all. Flip the screen, go through some basic settings like resolution and frame rates, choose what you want the gimbal to do, decide if it is a normal video or slow-motion, photos, timelapse, choose just what you are after, and that’s it.\n\nOther advantages of this camera:\n\nFast charging next to the possibility of having an additional “battery handle” if you purchase the “Combo Creator” package. This assures constant power for the entire day.\n\nFilming at up to 4K/60p is possible without cropping the image. Recording at a high frame rate (up to 4K/120p, no crop) is also possible for maximum family fun.\n\nDJI Mic 2 connectivity for superior 32-bit float audio (Creator Combo)\n\nRobustness: I was a bit afraid of having the Osmo Pockt 3 in my pocket…I was not so sure how the gimbal part of the camera would react, but I’m pleased to report that it withstands extensive walking and frequent pocketing, enduring countless times of being pulled out for filming without any issues.\n\nNow, it is not that those specifications were unavailable before in other filming devices; it is more about how DJI delivered them.\n\nDJI Osmo Pocket 3 review – handling\n\nCameras generally come in a horizontal shape, forcing you to mostly use two hands when filming. The same horizontal placement applies to pointing mobile phones if you are filming in a traditional 16×9 way. To allow “one-hand camera handling” and also support better fluid movement, many camera manufacturers are offering “tripod handles”, while third-party companies will take it a step further and try to sell you all sorts of gimbals. All that effort goes into achieving what the Osmo Pocket 3 is already doing in the first place without any additional accessories, namely, comfortable, vertical, single-hand handling supported by a built-in gimbal for smoother movement. As many of you already know, this concept simply works well. Now, back this functionality with a 1-inch sensor, and many close-up shots will get a desirable shallow depth of field.\n\nFilming effortlessly\n\nI don’t know about you guys, but back in the old days, I used to be a BIG director when it came to family vacations. Nowadays, I just want to save memories, and as we all know, in today’s fast-paced world, memories, as well as kids, do not stand still…\n\nThis is where the Osmo Pocket 3 shines. Take it out of the pocket, twist the LCD screen to power it on, and seamlessly integrate it into your movements! This thing is so small that it does not irritate anyone, and, at the same time, one does not have to be precise with framing. I mean, the lens is wide but not too wide, so it’s great not to worry too much about framing, especially in extremely bright outdoor conditions (by the way, a wider magnetic lens is included with the “Combo Creator Package”).\n\nI was also surprised to see (actually hear) that the audio coming from the internal microphones is fine for ambient sound next to capturing the dialogue from people standing next to you. I’ll touch on the subject of audio a little bit further down the road.\n\nWhat did I miss and hope to see in the future?\n\nWe all operate cameras differently and have different expectations, so maybe the ultimate filming device is still not here, yet I do believe that the Osmo Pocket 3 is a game changer (I can’t believe that I just used this word)… For even greater flexibility, I hope that the company will consider the following:\n\nTry to improve the gimbal even more. I want the “walking duck movement” to be a thing of the past.\n\nConsider adding an internal memory with a capacity sufficient for recording an hour or so. With this camera, you’ll find yourself filming more frequently (whether that’s fun or not), and having an internal backup for when your card fills up would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis is more of a personal wish, but two tiny DeadCat windshields to stick on both internal microphones would be great to have. They wouldn’t get in the way when operating the camera and could improve the overall sound quality when filming outdoors.\n\nThe red color recording indication currently displays on the left-hand side. On bright days, it is not so easy to see the LCD screen, so preferably, a red-colored frame to indicate recording would have been great to have.\n\nWhen touching the screen to change focus, the execution is fast. I wish there was a way to adjust the focus speed.\n\nMoiré is visible in fine lines. Hopefully, this can be improved.\n\nVlogging\n\nAs I gain trust working with the Osmo Pocket 3, I’m now experimenting with vlogging and find it to be extremely easy and intuitive. Touch the LCD screen to point the camera toward you, and it will recognize your face and start following it. The same can be done when the camera is pointing toward others. Actually, the kids had a good five minutes of trying to “escape from the camera” until they lost interest.\n\nIf you go with the “Combo Creator” package option, the simplicity of operation is maintained and even enhanced with the inclusion of the DJI Mic 2. Turn on the camera and transmitter, and they will locate each other easily. Use the camera menu settings to enable 32-bit float audio recording (happening on the transmitter itself). Also, formatting the 8GB internal memory of the mic is done throughout the camera menu settings, too. It is worth mentioning that after powering the DJI Mic 2 once, there is no need to worry about the device recording audio. Every time you start filming, the mic will start recording automatically. My advice is to turn “Vibration ON” so you can easily confirm that audio recording is indeed taking place.\n\nLast but not least, a second DJI Mic 2 can be connected to the camera, too, if wanted/needed.\n\nWith so many superlatives, is this the only device needed for capturing videos and photos?\n\nTo maintain adequate video/picture quality, DJI limited the degree of digital zooming to 2.0x. While this was mostly OK for recording video, it felt a bit limiting for taking photos. I would recommend having another camera (or a mobile phone) with you if taking photos is your priority.\n\nThe MIMo App\n\nI do recommend downloading DJI’s Mimo App. First, it will notify you and then allow you to download the latest camera firmware update. In addition, many of the basic camera controls can be executed via the app, which is helpful if you are a vlogger.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has been a while since I have so thoroughly enjoyed using a camera that mostly works for me. Its compact size, 1-inch sensor, handling, and robustness all make a strong case for this powerful little camera. I simply cannot imagine a future family vacation without it!\n\nDo you know what the hardest part of conducting this review was? Going back to filming on a mirrorless camera. Suddenly, it felt so limiting… The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 certainly exceeded my expectations. I wonder if the same concept can be applied to a device with a larger sensor, say APS-C (just out of curiosity). Would it make the camera so much larger to the point of defeating its purpose? Probably yes, yet those who are concerned about the current sensor size might be willing to explore such an optional device.\n\nAnd to answer my question at the start of this review, is the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 the best camera for traveling, family, and vlogging out there? In my opinion, absolutely! All in all, well done, DJI!"
