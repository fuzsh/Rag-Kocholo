And my Nikon is state of the art.\n\nMAX: Oh, I’ve got a Nikon too. It’s an N65 with 3D matrix metering, 35 to 210 zoom. What have you got?\n\nKIRK: It’s a Nikon.\n\nNikon is a Japanese corporation which makes products including cameras and photography equipment. It was founded in 1917, and changed its name to Nikon in 1988, after its cameras. It is a member of the Mitsubishi group.\n\nThe N65 was a 35 mm film SLR autofocus camera which came out in 2001, and was aimed at the lower end of the amateur photography market. In other words, it’s an entry level camera for the average consumer, but Max gives its specifications as if it is something out of the ordinary."
