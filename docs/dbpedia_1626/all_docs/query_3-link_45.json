        "text": "dvpalumbo says:\n\nI tried searching and did not find an answer, so I'm wondering if anyone here might know.\n\nI mostly shoot 70s/80s era Nikon, and so I'm generally aware of the various logos that match to different eras. After the early Nippon Kogaku, there was the thin logo on the rangefinders, then the upright bold logo on the F mount cameras which gave way to the current italics logo somewhere in the late 80s. I always assumed this matched with their general branding and so the Italics style \"Nikon\" marked products from 1988-present. But I just learned that the italics style logo actually goes back to the 1950s. Which is obvious, it's on all of the old manuals and packaging I've ever looked at.\n\nLooking into the history of the Nikon logo, it seems it went directly from the Nippon Kogaku style to the current italics in the 50s and the non-italicized style used on the prism of the F, F2, and F3 (and all other bodies in those eras) was never an official brand logo for any marketing. So what I'm wondering is, does anyone know why Nikon did this? Why the italics logo didn't show up on a camera body until 30+ years after it was adopted for all other marketing?\n\nOriginally posted at 2:24PM, 20 June 2023 PDT\n\ndvpalumbo edited this topic 14 months ago."
