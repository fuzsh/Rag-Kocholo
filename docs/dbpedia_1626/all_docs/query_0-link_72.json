        "text": "Outstanding resolution and superb overall performance in a lightweight and compact 28-75mm F2.8 G2 that inspires creativity.\n\nMarch 28, 2024 – Tamron Co., Ltd. (President & CEO: Shogo Sakuraba; Headquarters: Saitama City, Japan; “TAMRON”), a leading manufacturer of optics for diverse applications, announces the launch of the 28-75mm F/2.8 Di III VXD G2 (Model A063), a fast-aperture standard zoom lens for Nikon Z mount full-frame mirrorless cameras on April 18, 2024.\n\nPRODUCT NAME: 28-75mm F/2.8 Di III VXD G2 (Model A063) For Nikon Z mount DATE OF LAUNCH: April 18, 2024\n\nThe 28-75mm F2.8 G2 is compact and easy to use yet has excellent optical performance and is compatible with the latest digital cameras with increasingly high pixel resolution. The AF drive uses a linear motor focus mechanism VXD (Voice-coil eXtreme-torque Drive) that is fast, highly accurate and quiet. The lens also excels at close-up shooting, achieving an MOD (Minimum Object Distance) of 0.18m (7.1in) at the wide end and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:2.7. Additionally, the lens design takes operability into consideration by including a coating with excellent scratch resistance on the barrel of the lens and a rubber focusing ring for a comfortable, secure grip among other features.\n\nTAMRON pioneered the category of compact fast-aperture standard zoom lenses for mirrorless models. Now the 28-75mm F2.8 G2 will be available for Nikon Z mount as the ideal everyday lens for Nikon full-frame mirrorless camera users.\n\n1. Best image quality in the standard zoom lens class\n\nThe new zoom leverages the latest design expertise and comprises an optical construction with 17 elements in 15 groups. Two optimally arranged LD (Low Dispersion) and GM (Glass Molded Aspherical) lens elements control optical aberrations to the highest degree. The lens provides high-resolution performance from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner over the entire zoom range, even at wide open aperture. In addition, the soft, beautiful, round bokeh that can be achieved with a fast-aperture lens adds a distinctive dimension, especially to portraits. The overall compact size and high performance can be used advantageously with top-class, ultra-high-resolution mirrorless cameras.\n\n2. Fast, quiet VXD linear motor for high-speed and high-precision autofocus\n\nThe AF drive system employs TAMRON’s VXD linear motor focus mechanism. The high-speed, high-precision AF is exceedingly responsive and provides dependable and accurate focusing performance from MOD to infinity, despite the fast F2.8 aperture. The lens delivers excellent focus tracking of moving objects, so you are always ready for fast action. Additionally, the focus motor is quiet, so it's ideal for shooting both still images and video in situations that demand low noise.\n\n3. Light weight and compact\n\nThe 28-75mm F2.8 G2 is a fast-aperture standard zoom lens with a remarkably compact and lightweight design, just 119.8mm (4.7in) long. The maximum diameter is 75.8mm and it weighs only 550g (19.4oz). Filter size is 67mm. With a size that's easy to carry and a light weight that’s well-suited for handheld shooting for extended periods, the 28-75mm F2.8 G2 will surely become your favorite zoom for travel, street shooting, everyday carry, and spontaneous photo opportunities.\n\n4. MOD of 0.18m (7.1in) at the wide end and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:2.7 for creative close-ups\n\nThe 28-75mm F2.8 G2 features an MOD of 0.18m (7.1in) at the wide end. The working distance shrinks to around 4.4cm (1.7in) when used at MOD. Because the maximum magnification ratio is 1:2.7, you can get close to your subject for wide macro photography, enabling powerful visual impact with the subject positioned large in the frame while keeping a wide view of the background.\n\n5. TAMRON Lens Utility™ expands the possibilities of still photography and video shooting\n\nThe 28-75mm F2.8 G2 is compatible with the dedicated TAMRON Lens Utility software developed in-house by TAMRON that empowers users to easily update the lens to the latest firmware without going through the camera2, and includes functions to support focusing operations and other actions when shooting still images or video. By utilizing a wide range of functions3, users can expand the breadth of expression in still images and video. For example, A-B Focus allows users to limit focusing to two pre-selected focus points, shifting focus from one subject to the other with just a click of the Focus Set Button. Users can also choose between Linear and Non-Linear, which affects how the focus shifts during manual focusing.\n\n6. Enhanced overall lens design for user-friendly operation\n\nEvery individual part of the lens has been carefully scrutinized, right down to the fine details, resulting in an enhanced design that optimizes both operability and ergonomics. The surface of the lens exterior is glossy black. Improved abrasion resistance makes the lens barrel harder to scratch and resists fingerprints. Additionally, the grip performance has been improved. The smoothly curved, elegant surface of the brand ring creates a dignified appearance with a design that signifies functional beauty and high quality.\n\n7. Moisture-Resistant Construction and Fluorine Coating provide extra protection"
