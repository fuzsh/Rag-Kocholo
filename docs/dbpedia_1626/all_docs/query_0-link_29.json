        "text": "If you’re looking to get into 35mm photography and you don’t want to go the Leica route then a well-made camera from Nicca is the way to go. Often gems like these can be found at a fraction of the price of a Leica from the same period and in my opinion, a Nicca is as good or better than the camera that inspired them.

Fotodiox makes a wide range of quality adapters for use on almost any mirrorless body and vintage lens. You can find them at https://fotodioxpro.com/collections/lens-mount-adapters\n\nThanks for stopping by and have a beautiful day! – Chris\n\nBe sure to stop by my camera shop at http://www.ccstudio2380.com\n\nPlease respect that all content, including photos and text, are the property of this blog and its owner, Yashica Pentamatic Fanatic, Yashica Sailor Boy, Yashica Chris.\n\nCopyright © 2015-2020 Yashica Pentamatic Fanatic, Chris Whelan\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nWhenever I reminisce about classic cameras from the 1950s it’s hard not to think of this Nicca camera inspired by the iconic Leica 35mm rangefinder (RF).\n\nBy today’s standards there’s nothing easy about using a camera from this era. Some of the “negatives” – manual focusing using a rangefinder (not thru the lens like an SLR), manual exposure and shutter speed settings, difficult film loading, and lots of add-ons just to be able to shoot with a wide angle or telephoto lens to name just a few. The positives – this is considered to be a miniature camera (compared to other film cameras), interchangeable lenses, rugged construction, excellent lens choices, and portability. I like this camera because it just feels right cradled in your hand.\n\nIf you want to experience film photography in its purest form then check out one of these amazing machines from the 1950s. Leica, Nicca, Yashica, Canon, Nikon, Leotax, and dozens more.\n\nTotally random here but I wanted to give a shout out to my friend Peggy’s WordPress site at https://cameragocamera.com/ It’s a lot of fun to visit and she’s tested nearly every camera on the planet (almost) nearly every camera.

What better test than to shoot a portrait.\n\nI’m very happy with its performance across the spectrum. For a nearly 70-year-old lens pretty impressive.
