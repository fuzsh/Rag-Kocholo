        "text": "This edited collection explores the historical dimensions, cultural practices, socio-economic mechanisms and political agendas that shape the notion of a national cuisine inside and outside of Japan. Japanese food is often perceived as pure, natural, healthy and timeless, and these words not only fuel a hype surrounding Japanese food and lifestyle worldwide, but also a domestic retro-movement that finds health and authenticity in ‘traditional’ ingredients, dishes and foodways. The authors in this volume bring together research from the fields of history, cultural and religious studies, food studies as well as political science and international relations, and aim to shed light on relevant aspects of culinary nationalism in Japan while unearthing the underlying patterns and processes in the construction of food identities.\n\n“This is the best volume dealing with the production and consumption of food in Japan that has been published to date.” (Katarzyna J. Cwiertka, Global Food History, Vol. 4 (1), 2018) “An important and timely volume.” (Samuel Yamashita, Ponoma College, USA)\n\n“Covering a wide range of topics from history to culture, from public policy to nationalism, and from social history to contemporary consumption trends, the essays herein offer much useful information on as well as analytical insights into the richness, heterogeneity, and creativity of Japanese foodways.” (Timothy Y. Tsu, Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan)\n\n“A very welcome addition to the growing scholarship on Japanese food.” (Katarzyna J. Cwiertka, Leiden University, Netherlands)\n\nAndreas Niehaus is Head of the Department Languages and Cultures at Ghent University, Belgium. His research focuses on early-modern and modern Japanese body culture, sport history as well as cultural and national identities.\n\nTine Walravens is a Research Assistant at the Institute of Japanese Studies, Ghent University, Belgium. Her research is on the politics of food and food safety in East Asia, in particular Japanese consumer trust and food risk.\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 96.29\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 128.39\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 181.89\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access"
