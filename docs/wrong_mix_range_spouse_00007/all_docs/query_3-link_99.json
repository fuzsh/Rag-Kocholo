        "text": "Diastolic time â frequency relation in the stress echo lab: filling timing and flow at different heart rates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBombardini, Tonino; Gemignani, Vincenzo; Bianchini, Elisabetta; Venneri, Lucia; Petersen, Christina; Pasanisi, Emilio; Pratali, Lorenza; Alonso-Rodriguez, David; Pianelli, Mascia; Faita, Francesco; Giannoni, Massimo; Arpesella, Giorgio; Picano, Eugenio\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA cutaneous force-frequency relation recording system based on first heart sound amplitude vibrations has been recently validated. Second heart sound can be simultaneously recorded in order to quantify both systole and diastole duration. Aims 1- To assess the feasibility and extra-value of operator-independent, force sensor-based, diastolic time recording during stress. Methods We enrolled 161 patients referred for stress echocardiography (exercise 115, dipyridamole 40, pacing 6 patients). The sensor was fastened in the precordial region by a standard ECG electrode. The acceleration signal was converted into digital and recorded together with ECG signal. Both systolic and diastolic times were acquired continuously during stress and were displayed by plotting times vs. heart rate. Diastolic filling rate was calculated as echo-measured mitral filling volume/sensor-monitored diastolic time. Results Diastolic time decreased during stress more markedly than systolic time. At peak stress 62 of the 161 pts showed reversal of the systolic/diastolic ratio with the duration of systole longer than diastole. In the exercise group, at 100 bpm HR, systolic/diastolic time ratio was lower in the 17 controls (0.74 Â± 0.12) than in patients (0.86 Â± 0.10, p < 0.05 vs. controls). Diastolic filling rate increased from 101 Â± 36 (rest) to 219 Â± 92 ml/m2* s-1 at peak stress (p < 0.5 vs. rest). Conclusion Cardiological systolic and diastolic duration can be monitored during stress by using an acceleration force sensor. Simultaneous calculation of stroke volume allows monitoring diastolic filling rate. Stress-induced \"systolic-diastolic mismatch\" can be easily quantified and is associated to several cardiac diseases, possibly expanding the spectrum of information obtainable during stress.

It can cause symptoms of heart failure in patients even in the presence of normal systolic function. The parameters used to assess diastolic function often measure flow and are affected by the loading conditions of the heart. The interpretation of diastolic function in the context of congenital heart disease requires some understanding of the effects of the lesions themselves on these parameters. Individual congenital lesions will be discussed in this paper. Recently, load-independent techniques have led to more accurate measurements of ventricular compliance and remodeling in heart disease. The combination of inflow velocities and tissue Doppler measurements can be used to estimate diastolic function and LV filling pressures. This review focuses on diastolic function and assessment in congenital heart disease.

HFpEF, otherwise known as diastolic heart failure, has nearly the same grim prognosis as systolic heart failure, and diastolic heart failure is increasing in incidence and prevalence. Major trials have shown that many of the treatments that are salutary in systolic heart failure have no beneficial effects in diastolic heart failure, suggesting different underlying mechanisms for these two disorders. Even criteria for diagnosis of HFpEF are still debated, and there is still no gold standard marker to detect diastolic dysfunction. Here, we will review some promising new insights into the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction that may lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.\n\nPost-exercise contractility, diastolic function, and pressure: Operator-independent sensor-based intelligent monitoring for heart failure telemedicine\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBombardini, Tonino; Gemignani, Vincenzo; Bianchini, Elisabetta; Pasanisi, Emilio; Pratali, Lorenza; Pianelli, Mascia; Faita, Francesco; Giannoni, Massimo; Arpesella, Giorgio; Sicari, Rosa; Picano, Eugenio\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground New sensors for intelligent remote monitoring of the heart should be developed. Recently, a cutaneous force-frequency relation recording system has been validated based on heart sound amplitude and timing variations at increasing heart rates. Aim To assess sensor-based post-exercise contractility, diastolic function and pressure in normal and diseased hearts as a model of a wireless telemedicine system. Methods We enrolled 150 patients and 22 controls referred for exercise-stress echocardiography, age 55 Â± 18 years. The sensor was attached in the precordial region by an ECG electrode. Stress and recovery contractility were derived by first heart sound amplitude vibration changes; diastolic times were acquired continuously. Systemic pressure changes were quantitatively documented by second heart sound recording. Results Interpretable sensor recordings were obtained in all patients (feasibility = 100%). Post-exercise contractility overshoot (defined as increase > 10% of recovery contractility vs exercise value) was more frequent in patients than controls (27% vs 8%, p < 0.05). At 100 bpm stress heart rate, systolic/diastolic time ratio (normal, < 1) was > 1 in 20 patients and in none of the controls (p < 0.01); at recovery systolic/diastolic ratio was > 1 in only 3 patients (p < 0.01 vs stress). Post-exercise reduced arterial pressure was sensed. Conclusion Post-exercise contractility, diastolic time and pressure changes can be continuously measured by a cutaneous sensor. Heart disease affects not only exercise systolic performance, but also post-exercise recovery, diastolic time intervals and blood pressure changes â in our study, all of these were monitored by a non-invasive wearable sensor.

We aimed to determine whether patients with AF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF) survive longer with rhythm versus rate-control strategy. The Duke Cardiovascular Disease Database was queried to identify patients with EF > 50%, heart failure symptoms and AF between January 1,1995 and June 30, 2005. We compared baseline characteristics and survival of patients managed with rate- versus rhythm-control strategies. Using a 60-day landmark view, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and results were adjusted for baseline differences using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Three hundred eighty-two patients met the inclusion criteria (285 treated with rate-control and 97 treated with rhythm-control). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 93.2%, 69.3%, and 56.8%, respectively in rate-controlled patients and 94.8%, 78.0%, and 59.9%, respectively in rhythm-controlled patients (P > 0.10). After adjustments for baseline differences, no significant difference in mortality was detected (hazard ratio for rhythm-control vs rate-control = 0.696, 95% CI 0.453-1.07, P = 0.098). Based on our observational data, rhythm-control seems to offer no survival advantage over rate-control in patients with heart failure and preserved EF. Randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these findings and examine the effect of each strategy on stroke risk, heart failure decompensation, and quality of life.\n\nThe less familiar side of heart failure: symptomatic diastolic dysfunction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorris, Spencer A; Van Swol, Mark; Udani, Bela\n\n2005-06-01\n\nArrange for echocardiography or radionuclide angiography within 72 hours of a heart failure exacerbation. An ejection fraction >50% in the presence of signs and symptoms of heart failure makes the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure probable. To treat associated hypertension, use angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics to achieve a blood pressure goal of <130/80 mm Hg. When using beta-blockers to control heart rate, titrate doses more aggressively than would be done for systolic failure, to reach a goal of 60 to 70 bpm. Use ACE inhibitors/ARBs to decrease hospitalizations, decrease symptoms, and prevent left ventricular remodeling.\n\nAlterations in left ventricular diastolic function in conscious dogs with pacing-induced heart failure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKomamura, K.; Shannon, R. P.; Pasipoularides, A.; Ihara, T.; Lader, A. S.; Patrick, T. A.; Bishop, S. P.; Vatner, S. F.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe investigated in conscious dogs (a) the effects of heart failure induced by chronic rapid ventricular pacing on the sequence of development of left ventricular (LV) diastolic versus systolic dysfunction and (b) whether the changes were load dependent or secondary to alterations in structure. LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction were evident within 24 h after initiation of pacing and occurred in parallel over 3 wk. LV systolic function was reduced at 3 wk, i.e., peak LV dP/dt fell by -1,327 +/- 105 mmHg/s and ejection fraction by -22 +/- 2%. LV diastolic dysfunction also progressed over 3 wk of pacing, i.e., tau increased by +14.0 +/- 2.8 ms and the myocardial stiffness constant by +6.5 +/- 1.4, whereas LV chamber stiffness did not change. These alterations were associated with increases in LV end-systolic (+28.6 +/- 5.7 g/cm2) and LV end-diastolic stresses (+40.4 +/- 5.3 g/cm2). When stresses and heart rate were matched at the same levels in the control and failure states, the increases in tau and myocardial stiffness were no longer observed, whereas LV systolic function remained depressed. There were no increases in connective tissue content in heart failure. Thus, pacing-induced heart failure in conscious dogs is characterized by major alterations in diastolic function which are reversible with normalization of increased loading condition.\n\nEchocardiographic features of impaired left ventricular diastolic function in Chagas's heart disease.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCombellas, I; Puigbo, J J; Acquatella, H; Tortoledo, F; Gomez, J R\n\n1985-01-01\n\nTo study left ventricular diastolic function in Chagas's disease, simultaneous echocardiograms, phonocardiograms, and apexcardiograms were recorded in 20 asymptomatic patients with positive Chagas's serology and no signs of heart disease (group 1), 12 with Chagas's heart disease and symptoms of ventricular arrhythmia but no heart failure (group 2), 20 normal subjects (group 3), and 12 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (group 4). The recordings were digitised to determine left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time and the rate and duration of left ventricular cavity dimension increase and wall thinning. In groups 1 and 2 (a) aortic valve closure (A2) and mitral valve opening were significantly delayed relative to minimum dimension and were associated with prolonged isovolumic relaxation, (b) left ventricular cavity size was abnormally increased during isovolumic relaxation and abnormally reduced during isovolumic contraction, and (c) peak rate of posterior wall thinning and dimension increase were significantly reduced and duration of posterior wall thinning was significantly prolonged; both of these abnormalities occurred at the onset of diastolic filling. These abnormalities were more pronounced in group 2 and were accompanied by an increase in the height of the apexcardiogram \"a\" wave, an indication of pronounced atrial systole secondary to end diastolic filling impairment due to reduced left ventricular distensibility. Group 4, which had an established pattern of diastolic abnormalities, showed changes similar to those in group 2; however, the delay in aortic valve closure (A2) and in mitral valve opening and the degree of dimension change were greater in the latter group. Thus early isovolumic relaxation and left ventricular abnormalities were pronounced in the patients with Chagas's heart disease and may precede systolic compromise, which may become apparent in later stages of the disease. The digitised method is valuable in the early detection of\n\nIntravenous Milrinone Infusion Improves Congestive Heart Failure Caused by Diastolic Dysfunction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlbrecht, Carlos A.; Giesler, Gregory M.; Kar, Biswajit; Hariharan, Ramesh; Delgado, Reynolds M.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical treatment of heart failure patients with impaired systolic function, very little is known about the diagnosis and treatment of diastolic dysfunction. We report the cases of 3 patients in New York Heart Association functional class IV who had echocardiographically documented diastolic dysfunction as the main cause of heart failure. All 3 patients received medical therapy with long-term milrinone infusion. PMID:16107121\n\nDiastolic stiffness as assessed by diastolic wall strain is associated with adverse remodelling and poor outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhtani, Tomohito; Mohammed, Selma F; Yamamoto, Kazuhiro; Dunlay, Shannon M; Weston, Susan A; Sakata, Yasushi; Rodeheffer, Richard J; Roger, Veronique L; Redfield, Margaret M\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is complex but increased left ventricular (LV) diastolic stiffness plays a key role. A load-independent, non-invasive, direct measure of diastolic stiffness is lacking. The diastolic wall strain (DWS) index is based on the linear elastic theory, which predicts that impaired diastolic wall thinning reflects resistance to deformation in diastole and thus, increased diastolic myocardial stiffness. The objectives of this community-based study were to determine the distribution of this novel index in consecutive HFpEF patients and healthy controls, define the relationship between DWS and cardiac structure and function and determine whether increased diastolic stiffness as assessed by DWS is predictive of the outcome in HFpEF. Consecutive HFpEF patients (n = 327, EF â¥ 50%) and controls (n = 528) from the same community were studied. Diastolic wall strain was lower in HFpEF (0.33 Â± 0.08) than in controls (0.40 Â± 0.07, P < 0.001). Within HFpEF, those with DWS â¤ median (0.33) had higher LV mass index, relative wall thickness, E/e', Doppler-estimated LV end-diastolic pressure to LV end-diastolic volume ratio, left atrial volume index, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels than those with DWS > median. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients with DWS â¤ median had higher rate of death or HF hospitalization than those with DWS > median (P = 0.003) even after the adjustment for age, gender, log BNP, LV geometry, or log E/e' (P < 0.01). These data suggest that DWS, a simple index, is useful in assessing diastolic stiffness and that more advanced diastolic stiffness is associated with worse outcomes in HFpEF.\n\nEffect of exercise on diastolic function in heart failure patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPearson, M J; Mungovan, S F; Smart, N A\n\n2017-03-01\n\nDiastolic dysfunction contributes to the development and progression of heart failure. Conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging are widely utilised in clinical research providing a number of indices of diastolic function valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure patients. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effect of exercise training on diastolic function in patients with heart failure. Exercise training studies that investigate different indices of diastolic function in patients with heart failure have reported that exercise training improves diastolic function in these patients. We sought to add to the current literature by quantifying, where possible, the effect of exercise training on diastolic function. We conducted database searches (PubMed, EBSCO, EMBASE, and Cochrane Trials Register to 31 July 2016) for exercise based rehabilitation trials in heart failure, using the search terms 'exercise training, diastolic function and diastolic dysfunction'. Data from six studies, with a total of 266 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) participants, 144 in intervention groups and 122 in control groups, indicated a significant reduction in the ratio of early diastolic transmitral velocity (E) to early diastolic tissue velocity (E') (E/E' ratio) with exercise training, exercise vs. control mean difference (MD) of -2.85 (95% CI -3.66 to -2.04, pÂ <Â 0.00001). Data from five studies in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients, with a total of 204 participants, 115 in intervention groups and 89 in control groups, also demonstrated a significant improvement in E/E' in exercise vs. control MD of -2.38 (95% CI -3.47 to -1.28, pÂ <Â 0.0001).\n\nRelationship between heart rate and quiescent interval of the cardiac cycle in children using MRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Wei; Bogale, Saivivek; Golriz, Farahnaz; Krishnamurthy, Rajesh\n\n2017-11-01\n\nImaging the heart in children comes with the challenge of constant cardiac motion. A prospective electrocardiography-triggered CT scan allows for scanning during a predetermined phase of the cardiac cycle with least motion. This technique requires knowing the optimal quiescent intervals of cardiac cycles in a pediatric population. To evaluate high-temporal-resolution cine MRI of the heart in children to determine the relationship of heart rate to the optimal quiescent interval within the cardiac cycle. We included a total of 225 consecutive patients ages 0-18 years who had high-temporal-resolution cine steady-state free-precession sequence performed as part of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography study of the heart. We determined the location and duration of the quiescent interval in systole and diastole for heart rates ranging 40-178 beats per minute (bpm). We performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the duration of quiescent interval in systole and diastole for each heart rate group. The duration of the quiescent interval at heart rates <80 bpm and >90 bpm was significantly longer in diastole and systole, respectively (P<.0001 for all ranges, except for 90-99 bpm [P=.02]). For heart rates 80-89 bpm, diastolic interval was longer than systolic interval, but the difference was not statistically significant (P=.06). We created a chart depicting optimal quiescent intervals across a range of heart rates that could be applied for prospective electrocardiography-triggered CT imaging of the heart. The optimal quiescent interval at heart rates <80Â bpm is in diastole and at heart rates â¥90Â bpm is in systole. The period of quiescence at heart rates 80-89Â bpm is uniformly short in systole and diastole.\n\nPredictive value of high sensitivity CRP in patients with diastolic heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichowitz, Yoav; Arbel, Yaron; Wexler, Dov; Sheps, David; Rogowski, Ori; Shapira, Itzhak; Berliner, Shlomo; Keren, Gad; George, Jacob; Roth, Arie\n\n2008-04-25\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) has been tested in patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and mixed results have been obtained with regards to its potential predictive value. However, the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with diastolic HF is not established. We studied the predictive role of high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) in patients with diastolic HF. HsCRP levels were measured in a cohort of CHF outpatients, 77 patients with diastolic HF and 217 patients with systolic HF. Concentrations were compared to a large cohort of healthy population (n=7701) and associated with the HF admissions and mortality of the patients. Levels of hsCRP did not differ between patients with systolic and diastolic HF and were significantly elevated compared to the cohort of healthy subjects even after adjustment to various clinical parameters (p<0.0001). In patients with diastolic HF, hsCRP levels associated with New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA-FC) (r=0.31 p=0.01). On univariate Cox regression model hsCRP levels independently predicted hospitalizations in patients with systolic but not diastolic HF (p=0.047). HsCRP concentrations are elevated in patients with diastolic HF and correlate with disease severity; their prognostic value in this patient population should be further investigated.\n\nEvaluation of Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction with Early Systolic Dysfunction Using Two-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Canine Heart Failure Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Wei-Chun; Ma, Hong; Xie, Rong-Ai; Gao, Li-Jian; Tang, Yue; Wang, Hao\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis study evaluated the role of two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) for predicting left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in pacing-induced canine heart failure. Pacing systems were implanted in 8 adult mongrel dogs, and continuous rapid right ventricular pacing (RVP, 240 beats/min) was maintained for 2 weeks. The obtained measurements from 2DSTE included global strain rate during early diastole (SRe) and during late diastole (SRa) in the longitudinal (L-SRe, L-SRa), circumferential (C-SRe, C-SRa), and radial directions (R-SRe, R-SRa). Changes in heart morphology were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy at 2 weeks. The onset of LV diastolic dysfunction with early systolic dysfunction occurred 3 days after RVP initiation. Most of the strain rate imaging indices were altered at 1 or 3 days after RVP onset and continued to worsen until heart failure developed. Light and transmission electron microscopy showed myocardial vacuolar degeneration and mitochondrial swelling in the left ventricular at 2 weeks after RVP onset. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that parameters of conventional echocardiography and 2DSTE showed moderate correlation with LV pressure parameters, including E/Esep' (r = 0.58, P < 0.01), L-SRe (r = -0.58, P < 0.01), E/L-SRe (r = 0.65, P < 0.01), and R-SRe (r = 0.53, P < 0.01). ROC curves analysis showed that these indices of conventional echocardiography and strain rate imaging could effectively predict LV diastolic dysfunction (area under the curve: E/Esep' 0.78; L-SRe 0.84; E/L-SRe 0.80; R-SRe 0.80). 2DSTE was a sensitive and accurate technique that could be used for predicting LV diastolic dysfunction in canine heart failure model.

It leads to a number of severe complications. Diastolic heart failure, that is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), is especially common. New, but simple, indices for the early detection of patients who have not yet developed complications or are in their early developmental stages are still searched for. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and markers of diastolic heart failure (DHF) assessed in echocardiography in patients with hypertension and no symptoms of heart failure. The study was comprised of 65 patients with treated hypertension. Patients with symptoms of heart failure, those with diabetes and smokers were excluded. Arterial stiffness was measured with the Mobil-O-Graph NG PWA. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was estimated. The following markers of diastolic heart failure were assessed in the echocardiographic examination: E/A ratio - the ratio of the early (E) to late (A) ventricular filling velocities, DT - decceleration time, E/E' - the ratio of mitral peak velocity of early filling (E) to early diastolic mitral annular velocity E' in tissue Doppler echocardiography. PWV was statistically significantly higher in the DHF group. In the group of patients with heart failure, the average E/A ratio was significantly lower as compared to the group with no heart failure. Oscillometric measurement of pulse wave velocity is non-invasive, lasts a few minutes and does not require the presence of a specialist. It allows for an early detection of patients at risk of diastolic heart failure even within the conditions of primary health care.\n\nEffects of cardiac energy efficiency in diastolic heart failure: assessment with positron emission tomography with 11C-acetate.\n\nPubMed\n\nHasegawa, Shinji; Yamamoto, Kazuhiro; Sakata, Yasushi; Takeda, Yasuharu; Kajimoto, Katsufumi; Kanai, Yasukazu; Hori, Masatsugu; Hatazawa, Jun\n\n2008-06-01\n\nDiastolic heart failure (DHF) has become a high social burden, and its major underlying cardiovascular disease is hypertensive heart disease. However, the pathogenesis of DHF remains to be clarified. This study aimed to assess the effects of cardiac energy efficiency in DHF patients. (11)C-Acetate positron emission tomography and echocardiography were conducted in 11 DHF Japanese patients and 10 normal volunteers. The myocardial clearance rate of radiolabeled (11)C-acetate was measured to calculate the work metabolic index (WMI), an index of cardiac efficiency. The ratio of peak mitral E wave velocity to peak early diastolic septal myocardial velocity (E/e') was calculated to assess left ventricular (LV) filling pressure. The LV mass index was greater and the mean age was higher in the DHF patients than in the normal volunteers. There was no difference in WMI between the two groups. However, WMI varied widely among the DHF patients and was inversely correlated with E/e' (r=-0.699, p=0.017). In contrast, there was no correlation in the normal volunteers. In conclusion, the inefficiency of energy utilization is not a primary cause of diastolic dysfunction or DHF, and cardiac efficiency may not affect diastolic function in normal hearts. However, the energy-wasting state may induce the elevation of LV filling pressure in DHF patients, which was considered to principally result from the progressive diastolic dysfunction.\n\nA protocol to study ex vivo mouse working heart at human-like heart rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Han-Zhong; Jin, Jian-Ping\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGenetically modified mice are widely used as experimental models to study human heart function and diseases. However, the fast rate of normal mouse heart at 400-600bpm limits its capacity of assessing kinetic parameters that are important for the physiology and pathophysiology of human heart that beats at a much slower rate (75-180bpm). To extend the value of mouse models, we established a protocol to study ex vivo mouse working hearts at a human-like heart rate. In the presence of 300Î¼M lidocaine to lower pacemaker and conductive activities and prevent arrhythmia, a stable rate of 120-130bpm at 37Â°C is achieved for ex vivo mouse working hearts. The negative effects of decreased heart rate on force-frequency dependence and lidocaine as a myocardial depressant on intracellular calcium can be compensated by using a higher but still physiological level of calcium (2.75mM) in the perfusion media. Multiple parameters were studied to compare the function at the human-like heart rate with that of ex vivo mouse working hearts at the standard rate of 480bpm. The results showed that the conditions for slower heart rate in the presence of 300Î¼M lidocaine did not have depressing effect on left ventricular pressure development, systolic and diastolic velocities and stroke volume with maintained positive inotropic and lusitropic responses to Î²-adrenergic stimulation. Compared with that at 480bpm, the human-like heart rate increased ventricular filling and end diastolic volume with enhanced Frank-Starling responses. Coronary perfusion was increased from longer relaxation time and interval between beats whereas cardiac efficiency was significantly improved. Although the intrinsic differences between mouse and human heart remain, this methodology for ex vivo mouse hearts to work at human-like heart rate extends the value of using genetically modified mouse models to study cardiac function and human heart diseases.

There is no published information on this condition in China. To ascertain the prevalence of diastolic heart failure in this community, 200 consecutive patients with the typical features of congestive heart failure were studied with standard 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. A LV ejection fraction (LVEF) >45% was considered normal. The results showed that 12.5% had significant valvular heart disease. Of the remaining 175 patients, 132 had a LVEF >45% (75%). Therefore, 66% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure had a normal LVEF. Heart failure with normal LV systolic function was more common than systolic heart failure in those >70 years old (65% vs 47%; p = 0.015). Most (57%) had an abnormal relaxation pattern in diastole and 14% had a restrictive filling pattern. In the systolic heart failure group, a restrictive filling pattern was more common (46%). There were no significant differences in the sex distribution, etiology, or prevalence of LV hypertrophy between these 2 heart failure groups. In conclusion, heart failure with a normal LVEF or diastolic heart failure is more common than systolic heart failure in Chinese patients with the symptoms of heart failure. This may be related to older age at presentation and the high prevalence of hypertension in this community.\n\nEffect of varying heart rate on intra-ventricular filling fluid dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanthanakrishnan, Arvind; Okafor, Ikechukwu; Angirish, Yagna; Yoganathan, Ajit\n\n2013-11-01\n\nImpaired exercise tolerance is used to delineate asymptomatic patients during the clinical diagnosis of diastolic left heart failure. Examining the effects of varying heart rate on intra-ventricular filling can provide a physical understanding of the specific flow characteristics that are impacted during exercise. In this study, diastolic filling was investigated with an anatomical left ventricle (LV) physical model under normal heart rate of 70 bpm, and varying exercise conditions of 100 bpm and 120 bpm. The LV model was incorporated into a flow loop and tuned for physiological inflow rates and outflow pressures. 2D PIV measurements were conducted along 3 parallel longitudinal planes. The systemic pressure was maintained the same across all test conditions. The E/A ratio was maintained within 1.0-1.2 across all heart rates. The strength of the mitral vortex ring formed during E-wave, as well as the peak incoming jet velocity, decreased with increasing heart rate. During peak flow of the A-wave, the vortex ring propagated farther into the LV for 120 bpm as compared to 70 bpm. The results point to the heightened role of the atrial kick for optimal LV filling during exercise conditions. This study was funded by a grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (RO1HL70262).\n\nDiastolic dysfunction in hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nNazÃ¡rio LeÃ£o, R; Marques da Silva, P\n\nHypertension and coronary heart disease, often coexisting, are the most common risk factors for heart failure. The progression of hypertensive heart disease involves myocardial fibrosis and alterations in the left ventricular geometry that precede the functional change, initially asymptomatic. The left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is part of this continuum being defined by the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction without signs or symptoms of heart failure or poor left ventricular systolic function. It is highly prevalent in hypertensive patients and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite its growing importance in clinical practice it remains poorly understood. This review aims to present the epidemiological fundamentals and the latest developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

We hypothesized that, in patients with heart failure (HF), regardless of LV ejection fraction (EF), there is diastolic temporal nonuniformity with a delay of longitudinal relative to circumferential expansion. Echocardiography was performed in 143 HF patients-50 with preserved EF (HFpEF) and 93 with reduced EF (HFrEF)-as well as 31 normal control subjects. The delay of early-diastolic mitral annular velocity from the mitral Doppler E (T E-e' ) was measured as a parameter of the longitudinal expansion delay. The delay of the longitudinal early-diastolic global strain rate (SR E ) relative to circumferential SR E (Delay C-L ) was calculated as a parameter of temporal nonuniformity. Intra-LV pressure difference (IVPD) was estimated with the use of color M-mode Doppler data as a parameter of LV diastolic suction. Although normal control subjects had symmetric LV expansion in early diastole, T E-e' and Delay C-L were significantly prolonged in HF regardless of EF (Pâ<â.01 vs control for all). Multivariate analysis revealed that Delay C-L was the independent determinant of IVPD among the parameters of LV geometry and contraction (Î²â=â-0.21; Pâ<â.05). An abnormal temporal nonuniformity of early-diastolic expansion is present in HF regardless of EF, which was associated with reduced LV suction. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The workup of these patients includes blood chemistry and biomarkers, imaging and functional testing of the heart and lungs. A diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is inferred through the exclusion of systolic abnormalities, a normal pulmonary function test and normal hemoglobin, coupled with diastolic abnormalities on echocardiography. Differentiating confounders such as obesity or deconditioning in a patient with diastolic abnormalities is difficult. While the most recent guidelines provide more avenues for diagnosis, such as incorporating the left atrial size, little emphasis is given to understanding left atrial function, which contributes to at least 25% of diastolic left ventricular filling; additionally, exercise stress testing to elicit symptoms and test the dynamics of diastolic parameters, especially when access to the âgold standardâ invasive tests is lacking, presents clinical translational gaps. It is thus important in diastolic heart failure work up to understand left atrial mechanics and the role of exercise testing to build a comprehensive argument for the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure in a patient presenting with SOB.

Clinical studies in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction have shown that heart rate lowering with beta-blockers and ivabradine improves survival. It is therefore often assumed that heart rate lowering is beneficial in other patients as well. Here, we critically appraise the effects of pharmacological heart rate lowering in patients with both normal and reduced ejection fraction with an emphasis on the effects of pharmacological heart rate lowering in hypertension and heart failure. Emerging evidence from recent clinical trials and meta-analyses suggest that pharmacological heart rate lowering is not beneficial in patients with a normal or preserved ejection fraction. This has just begun to be reflected in some but not all guideline recommendations. The detrimental effects of pharmacological heart rate lowering are due to an increase in central blood pressures, higher left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, and increased ventricular wall stress. Therefore, we propose that heart rate lowering per se reproduces the hemodynamic effects of diastolic dysfunction and imposes an increased arterial load on the left ventricle, which combine to increase the risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Pharmacologic heart rate lowering is clearly beneficial in patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy but not in patients with normal chamber dimensions and normal systolic function. These conflicting effects can be explained based on a model that considers the hemodynamic and ventricular structural effects of heart rate changes.\n\nCats with diabetes mellitus have diastolic dysfunction in the absence of structural heart disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nPereira, N J; Novo Matos, J; Baron Toaldo, M; Bartoszuk, U; Summerfield, N; Riederer, A; Reusch, C; Glaus, T M\n\n2017-07-01\n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) can result in cardiovascular dysfunction and heart failure characterized by diastolic dysfunction with or without the presence of systolic dysfunction in people and laboratory animals. The objective of this prospective study was to determine if cats with newly diagnosed DM had myocardial dysfunction and, if present, whether it would progress if appropriate antidiabetic therapy was commenced. Thirty-two diabetic cats were enrolled and received baseline echocardiographic examination; of these, 15 cats were re-examined after 6 months. Ten healthy age- and weight-matched cats served as controls. Diabetic cats at diagnosis showed decreased diastolic, but not systolic function, when compared to healthy controls, with lower mitral inflow E wave (E) and E/E' than controls. After 6 months, E and E/IVRT' decreased further in diabetic cats compared to the baseline evaluation. After excluding cats whose DM was in remission at 6 months, insulin-dependent diabetic cats had lower E, E/A and E' than controls. When classifying diastolic function according to E/A and E'/A', there was shift towards impaired relaxation patterns at 6 months. All insulin-dependent diabetic cats at 6 months had abnormal diastolic function. These results indicate that DM has similar effects on diastolic function in feline and human diabetics. The dysfunction seemed to progress rather than to normalize after 6 months, despite antidiabetic therapy. In cats with pre-existing heart disease, the development of DM could represent an important additional health risk. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were collected and analyzed for all-cause mortality in 473 furosemide-treated patients aged >or=60 years, hospitalized for acutely decompensated HF. Diastolic heart failure patients (n = 183) were more likely to be older, female, hypertensive, obese, with shorter preexisting HF duration, atrial fibrillation, lower New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, lower maintenance furosemide dosages, and to receive calcium antagonists. The SHF group (290 patients) demonstrated prevailing coronary artery disease, nitrate or digoxin treatment, and electrocardiographic conduction disturbances (P rates were 82%, 48% and 33% in DHF versus 74%, 46% and 30% in SHF (P = 0.3). Higher furosemide daily dosage at discharge (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.11-1.37, P < 0.001), increasing age (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09-1.54, P = 0.003), peripheral arterial disease (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.02-2.13, P = 0.043), and a history of stroke (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.98-2.1, P = 0.066) were most significantly associated with shorter survival in SHF. DHF, in turn, demonstrated higher NYHA class (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.48-4.29, P < 0.001), history of non-advanced malignancy (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.3-4.85, P = 0.012), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.97-2.64, P = 0.066). Antilipid treatment (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.3-1.02, P = 0.049) predicted better survival. In-patients with acutely decompensated DHF differ from similar SHF subjects with respect to prognostic significance of a number of clinical variables. This observation might carry practical implications.\n\nHeart rate and blood pressure variations after transvascular patent ductus arteriosus occlusion in dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Monte, Valentina; Staffieri, Francesco; Caivano, Domenico; Nannarone, Sara; Birettoni, Francesco; Porciello, Francesco; Di Meo, Antonio; Bufalari, Antonello\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe objective of the study was to retrospectively analyse the cardiovascular effects that occurs following the transvascular occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in dogs. Sixteen anaesthesia records were included. Variables were recorded at the time of placing the arterial introducer, occlusion of the ductus, and from 5 to 60min thereafter, including, among the other, heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The maximal percentage variation of the aforementioned physiological parameters within 60min of occlusion, compared with the values recorded at the introducer placing, was calculated. The time at which maximal variation occurred was also computed. Correlations between maximal percentage variation of physiological parameters and the diameter of the ductus and systolic and diastolic flow velocity through it were evaluated with linear regression analysis. Heart rate decreased after occlusion of the ductus with a mean maximal percentage variation of 41.0Â±14.8% after 21.2Â±13.7min. Mean and diastolic arterial blood pressure increased after occlusion with a mean maximal percentage variation of 30.6Â±18.1 and 55.4Â±27.1% after 19.6Â±12.1 and 15.7Â±10.8min, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure variation had a significant and moderate inverse correlation with diastolic and systolic flow velocity through the ductus. Transvascular patent ductus arteriosus occlusion in anaesthetised dogs causes a significant reduction in heart rate and an increase in diastolic and mean blood arterial pressure within 20min of closure of the ductus.

Records and radiographs from 24 cavalier King Charles spaniels with mitral regurgitation were used. Vertebral heart scale (24 dogs), and left atrial dimension and left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameters (18 dogs) and their rate of increase were measured at intervals over years to the onset of congestive heart failure. They were plotted against time to onset of congestive heart failure. Dimensions and rates of change of all parameters were highest at onset of congestive heart failure, the difference between observed and chance outcome being highly significant using a two-tailed chi-square test (P<0.001). The left heart chambers increase in size rapidly only in the last year before the onset of congestive heart failure. Increasing left ventricular end systolic dimension is suggestive of myocardial failure before the onset of congestive heart failure. Rate of increase of heart dimensions may be a useful indicator of impending congestive heart failure.\n\nAssociation of the Fourth Heart Sound with Increased Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Stiffness\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShah, Sanjiv J.; Nakamura, Kenta; Marcus, Gregory M.; Gerber, Ivor L.; McKeown, Barry H.; Jordan, Mark V.; Huddleston, Michele; Foster, Elyse; Michaels, Andrew D.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Although the fourth heart sound (S4) is thought to be associated with a stiff left ventricle (LV), this association has never been proven. Recently, single-beat estimation of the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR) has been characterized (P = Î±VÎ²), allowing the estimation of EDPVR in larger groups of patients. We hypothesized that the S4 is associated with an upward- and leftward-shifted EDPVR, indicative of elevated end-diastolic stiffness. Methods and Results Ninety study participants underwent acoustic cardiographic analysis, echocardiography, and left heart catheterization. We calculated Î± and Î² coefficients to define the non-linear slope of the EDPVR using the single-beat method for measuring LV end-diastolic elastance. In the P = Î±VÎ² EDPVR estimation, Î± was similar (p=0.31) but Î² was significantly higher in the S4 group (5.96 vs. 6.51, p=0.002), signifying a steeper, upward- and leftward-shifted EDPVR curve in subjects with an S4. The intensity of the S4 was associated with both Î² (r=0.42, p < 0.0001) and E/Eâ Ã· stroke volume index, another index of diastolic stiffness (r=0.39, p=0.0008). On multivariable analysis, Î² remained associated with the presence (p=0.008) and intensity (p<0.0001) of S4 after controlling for age, sex, and ejection fraction. Conclusions The S4 is most likely generated from an abnormally stiff LV, supporting the concept that the S4 is a pathologic finding in older patients.

HFNEF patients typically show diastolic dysfunction, caused by a decrease in relaxation capability of the left ventricular (LV) muscle tissue and/or an increase in LV chamber stiffness. Numerous studies using non-invasive medical imaging have shown that an intraventricular filling vortex is formed in the LV during diastole. We conducted 2D particle image velocimetry and hemodynamics measurements on a left heart simulator to investigate diastolic flow under increasing LV wall stiffness, LV wall thickness and heart rate (HR) conditions. Flexible-walled, optically clear LV physical models cast from silicone were fitted within a fluid-filled acrylic chamber. Pulsatile flow within the LV model was generated using a piston pump and 2-component Windkessel elements were used to tune the least stiff (baseline) LV model to physiological conditions. The results show that peak circulation of the intraventricular filling vortex is diminished in conditions of diastolic dysfunction as compared to the baseline case. Increasing HR exacerbated the circulation of the filling vortex across all cases.\n\nWearing an abdominal belt increases diastolic blood pressure.\n\nPubMed\n\nRafacz, W; McGill, S M\n\n1996-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of wearing an abdominal belt on blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate during a variety of tasks. The belt was typical of the elastic type with suspenders and Velcro tabs for cinching the belt snug. The tasks performed included sitting at rest, sitting with the torso inclined forward at 45 degrees, standing with the torso inclined forward at 45 degrees (with and without holding an 11-kg weight), a trunk axial rotation task, and squat lifting. Blood pressure was monitored noninvasively with a FINAPRES blood pressure monitor. Twenty healthy men performed each task with and without the abdominal belt. Although no significant increases in mean systolic blood pressure or heart rate were found, there was a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure in all conditions. All people considering wearing an abdominal belt should also consider the risks and liability associated with the additional cardiovascular load, particularly heart attack and stroke.\n\nHeart rate differentiates urgency and emergency in hypertensive crisis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl Bannay, Rashed; BÃ¶hm, Michael; Husain, Aysha\n\n2013-08-01\n\nTo study the clinical significance of presenting blood pressure parameters and heart rate in patients with hypertensive crisis. In patients admitted with hypertensive crisis between January 2011 and May 2011, demography, mode of presentation, co-morbidities, blood pressure readings, and heart rate at presentation were documented. Further clustering of hypertensive crisis into emergency or urgency was based on the presence or absence of target organ involvement. The relationship between blood pressure parameters, heart rate, and other variables was analyzed. 189 patients in sinus rhythm were enrolled in this pilot study. The rate of hypertensive urgency was 56 %, whereas the rate of hypertensive emergency was 44 %, respectively. Subjects with hypertensive emergency had a higher mean heart rate (93 Â± 22.7 bpm) than those with urgency (81 Â± 11.5 bpm) (P = 0.015). Women had higher heart rates (92 Â± 18.5 bpm) than men (86 Â± 17.6 bpm) (P = 0.014). Heart rates below 100 bpm had a specificity of 94 %, classifying patients as hypertensive urgency. Tachycardia had a powerful statistical association with hypertensive left ventricular failure (P < 0.0001). Other hemodynamic parameters, including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean blood pressure relates neither to urgency nor to emergency. Diabetic patients with HBA1c levels of more than 53 mmol/mol had a heart rate of more than 100 bpm (P = 0.015) during hypertensive crisis. Normal heart rate is characteristic of hypertensive urgency. Tachycardia in this setting is an ominous sign and denotes hypertensive complications in particular left ventricular failure. Among diabetics, elevated heart rate is associated with poor glycemic control.\n\nDoppler Assessment of Diastolic Function Reflect the Severity of Injury in Rats With Chronic Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanchez, Pablo; Lancaster, Jordan J; Weigand, Kyle; Mohran, Saffie-Alrahman Ezz-Eldin; Goldman, Steven; Juneman, Elizabeth\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFor chronic heart failure (CHF), more emphasis has been placed on evaluation of systolic as opposed to diastolic function. Within the study of diastology, measurements of left ventricular (LV) longitudinal myocardial relaxation have the most validation. Anterior wall radial myocardial tissue relaxation velocities along with mitral valve inflow (MVI) patterns are applicable diastolic parameters in the differentiation between moderate and severe disease in the ischemic rat model of CHF. Myocardial tissue relaxation velocities correlate with traditional measurements of diastolic function (ie, hemodynamics, Tau, and diastolic pressure-volume relationships). Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent left coronary artery ligation or sham operation. Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 6 weeks after coronary ligation to evaluate LV ejection fraction (EF) and LV diastolic function through MVI patterns (E, A, and E/A) and Doppler imaging of the anterior wall (e' and a'). The rats were categorized into moderate or severe CHF according to their LV EF at 3 weeks postligation. Invasive hemodynamic measurements with solid-state pressure catheters were obtained at the 6-week endpoint. Moderate (Nâ=â20) and severe CHF (Nâ=â22) rats had significantly (Pâ<â.05) different EFs, hemodynamics, and diastolic pressure-volume relationships. Early diastolic anterior wall radial relaxation velocities as well as E/e' ratios separated moderate from severe CHF and both diastolic parameters had strong correlations with invasive hemodynamic measurements of diastolic function. Radial anterior wall e' and E/e' can be used for serial assessment of diastolic function in rats with moderate and severe CHF. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular diastolic function in children with PAH in relation to simultaneously measured invasive reference measures. We prospectively recruited children undergoing a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization for evaluation of PAH and pulmonary vasoreactivity testing. Echocardiography was performed simultaneously with invasive reference measurements by high-fidelity micromanometer catheter. For analysis, patients were divided into shunt and nonshunt groups. Sixteen children were studied. In the group as a whole, significant correlations were found among Ï and tricuspid deceleration time, E', E/E', TimeE-E', A wave velocity, and global early and late diastolic strain rate. dp/dt minimum correlated significantly with late diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (A'), tissue Doppler imaging-derived systolic:diastolic duration ratio, and global late diastolic strain rate. End-diastolic pressure correlated significantly with tissue Doppler imaging-derived systolic:diastolic duration ratio. On multivariate analysis, tricuspid deceleration time, TimeE-E', and global early diastolic strain rate were independent predictors of Ï, whereas tissue Doppler imaging-derived systolic:diastolic duration ratio was an independent predictor of dp/dt minimum. In general, correlations between echocardiographic and invasive parameters were better in the shunt group than in the nonshunt group. Echocardiography correlates with invasive reference measures of right ventricular diastolic function in children with PAH, although it does not differentiate between early versus late diastolic abnormalities. Newer echocardiographic techniques may have added value to assess right ventricular diastolic dysfunction in this\n\nPresystolic tricuspid valve closure: an alternative mechanism of diastolic sound genesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, C H; Xiao, H B; Gibson, D G\n\n1990-01-01\n\nWe describe a previously unrecognised cause of an added diastolic heart sound. The patient had first-degree heart block and diastolic tricuspid regurgitation, leading to presystolic closure of the tricuspid valve and the production of a loud diastolic sound. Unlike previously described mechanisms for diastolic sounds, this sound was generated by the sudden acceleration of retrograde AV flow in late diastole.\n\nIncreased sodium/calcium exchanger activity enhances beta-adrenergic-mediated increase in heart rate: Whole-heart study in a homozygous sodium/calcium exchanger overexpressor mouse model.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaese, Sven; BÃ¶geholz, Nils; Pauls, Paul; Dechering, Dirk; Olligs, Jan; KÃ¶lker, Katharina; Badawi, Sascha; Frommeyer, Gerrit; Pott, Christian; Eckardt, Lars\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe cardiac sodium/calcium (Na + /Ca 2+ ) exchanger (NCX) contributes to diastolic depolarization in cardiac pacemaker cells. Increased NCX activity has been found in heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The influence of increased NCX activity on resting heart rate, beta-adrenergic-mediated increase in heart rate, and cardiac conduction properties is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of NCX overexpression in a homozygous transgenic whole-heart mouse model (NCX-OE) on sinus and AV nodal function. Langendorff-perfused, beating whole hearts of NCX-OE and the corresponding wild-type (WT) were studied Â± isoproterenol (ISO; 0.2 Î¼M). Epicardial ECG, AV nodal Wenckebach cycle length (AVN-WCL), and retrograde AVN-WCL were obtained. At baseline, basal heart rate was unaltered between NCX-OE and WT (WT: cycle length [CL] 177.6 Â± 40.0 ms, no. of hearts [n] = 20; NCX-OE: CL 185.9 Â± 30.5 ms, n = 18; P = .21). In the presence of ISO, NCX-OE exhibited a significantly higher heart rate compared to WT (WT: CL 133.4 Â± 13.4 ms, n = 20; NCX-OE: CL 117.7 Â± 14.2 ms, n = 18; P <.001). ISO led to a significant shortening of the anterograde and retrograde AVN-WCL without differences between NCX-OE and WT. This study is the first to demonstrate that increased NCX activity enhances beta-adrenergic increase of heart rate. Mechanistically, increased NCX inward mode activity may promote acceleration of diastolic depolarization in sinus nodal pacemaker cells, thus enhancing chronotropy in NCX-OE. These findings suggest a novel potential therapeutic target for heart rate control in the presence of increased NCX activity, such as heart failure. Copyright Â© 2017 Heart Rhythm Society.

We investigated the influence of transition training (TT) and competitive training (CT) on resting heart rate, its mechanisms of control, spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and relationships between heart rate mechanisms and cardiac structure in professional cyclists (N = 10). Heart rate (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (Pulse Tonometry) were recorded continuously. Autonomic blockade was performed (atropine-0.04 mg.kg-1; esmolol-500 Î¼g.kg-1 = 0.5 mg). Vagal effect, intrinsic heart rate, parasympathetic (n) and sympathetic (m) modulations, autonomic influence, autonomic balance and BRS were calculated. Plasma norepinephrine (high-pressure liquid chromatography) and cardiac structure (echocardiography) were evaluated. Resting heart rate was similar in TT and CT. However, vagal effect, intrinsic heart rate, autonomic influence and parasympathetic modulation (higher n value) decreased in CT (Pâ¤0.05). Sympathetic modulation was similar in both trainings. The autonomic balance increased in CT but still showed parasympathetic predominance. Cardiac diameter, septum and posterior wall thickness and left ventricular mass also increased in CT (P<0.05) as well as diastolic function. We observed an inverse correlation between left ventricular diastolic diameter, septum and posterior wall thickness and left ventricular mass with intrinsic heart rate. Blood pressure and BRS were similar in both trainings. Intrinsic heart rate mechanism is predominant over vagal effect during CT, despite similar resting heart rate. Preserved blood pressure levels and BRS during CT are probably due to similar sympathetic modulation in both trainings.\n\nAmbulatory blood pressure and heart rate during shuttle flight, entry and landing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThornton, W.; Moore, T. P.; Uri, J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAmbulatory blood pressures (BP) and heart rates (HR) were recorded on a series of early Shuttle flights during preflight and pre-entry, entry, landing and egress. There were no significant differences between flight and preflight values during routine activity. Systolic blood pressure was slightly elevated in the deorbit period and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rates were all elevated with onset of gravitoinertial loads and remained so through egress. Two of seven subjects had orthostatic problems in egress but their data did not show significant differences from others except in heart rate. Comparison of this data to that from recent studies show even larger increase in HR/BP values during current deorbit and entry phases which is consistent with increased heat and weight loads imposed by added survival gear. Both value and limitations of ambulatory heart rate/blood pressure data in this situation are demonstrated.\n\nResting Heart Rate as Predictor for Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Heart Failure: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOpdahl, Anders; Venkatesh, Bharath Ambale; Fernandes, Veronica R.

C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between baseline resting heart rate and incidence of heart failure (HF) and global and regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. BACKGROUND The association of resting heart rate to HF and LV function is not well described in an asymptomatic multi-ethnic population. METHODS Participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis had resting heart rate measured at inclusion. Incident HF was registered (n=176) during follow-up (median 7 years) in those who underwent cardiac MRI (n=5000). Changes in ejection fraction (ÎEF) and peak circumferential strain (ÎÎµcc) were measured as markers of developing global and regional LV dysfunction in 1056 participants imaged at baseline and 5 years later. Time to HF (Cox model) and ÎÎµcc and ÎEF (multiple linear regression models) were adjusted for demographics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, calcium score, LV end-diastolic volume and mass in addition to resting heart rate. RESULTS Cox analysis demonstrated that for 1 bpm increase in resting heart rate there was a 4% greater adjusted relative risk for incident HF (Hazard Ratio: 1.04 (1.02, 1.06 (95% CI); P<0.001). Adjusted multiple regression models demonstrated that resting heart rate was positively associated with deteriorating Îµcc and decrease in EF, even in analyses when all coronary heart disease events were excluded from the model. CONCLUSION Elevated resting heart rate is associated with increased risk for incident HF in asymptomatic participants in MESA. Higher heart rate is related to development of regional and global LV dysfunction independent of subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

The increases in workersâ blood pressure and heart rate were detected during and after exposure to high levels of noise. The objectives of this research were to determine whether the noise exposures have any effects on blood pressure and heart rate of workers in the automotive parts industry. METHODS This case study was done in 2011 at different units of an automotive parts manufacturing in Tehran. Sound pressure level was measured at different units of the factory with a calibrated instrument. Demographic features of workers were gathered with an appropriate questionnaire. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured twice in a day in the start time of work day (before exposure to noise) and middle shift hours (during exposure to noise) in the occupational physician office. For analyzing data, chi-square, independent sample t-test, paired t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used. P < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The average age of workers in the case and control groups was 35.71 Â± 8.10 and 33.40 Â± 10.41 years, respectively. There was no difference between the average age of case and control groups (P = 0.436). The results of ANCOVA revealed the significant differences between the mean changes of heart rate F (1, 37) = 26.68, P < 0.001, systolic blood pressure F (1, 37) = 21.70, P < 0.001, and diastolic blood pressure F (1, 37) = 26.20, P < 0.001 of workers in the case and control groups. CONCLUSION Exposure to industrial noise may increase the heart rate of workers. Although rises in heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure of workers in the case group were observed after exposure to noise, the values of heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were in the normal range. Further experimental investigations are needed to determine the relationships between these variables.

We investigated the relationships of resting heart rate and body size with the peak velocities and amplitudes of LV systolic and early diastolic long axis motion, and also with long-axis contraction duration. Two groups of adults free of cardiac disease underwent pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging at the septal and lateral mitral annular borders. Group 1 (n = 77) were healthy subjects <50 years of age and Group 2 (n = 65) were subjects between 40-80 years of age referred for stress echocardiography. Systolic excursion (SExc), duration (SDur) and peak velocity (s') and early diastolic excursion (EDExc) and peak velocity (e') were measured. SExc was not correlated with heart rate, height or body surface area (BSA) for either LV wall in either group, but SDur was inversely correlated with heart rate for both walls and both groups, and after adjustment for heart rate, males in both groups had a shorter septal SDur. Septal and lateral s` were independently and positively correlated with SExc, heart rate and height in both groups, independent of sex and age. There were no correlations of heart rate, height or BSA with either e` or EDExc for either wall in either group. Heart rate and height independently modify the relationship between s` and SExc, but neither are related to EDExc or e`. These findings suggest that s` and SExc cannot be used interchangeably for the assessment of LV long-axis contraction.\n\nNumerical modeling of dynamics of heart rate and arterial pressure during passive orthostatic test\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIshbulatov, Yu. M.; Kiselev, A. R.; Karavaev, A. S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA model of human cardiovascular system is proposed to describe the main heart rhythm, influence of autonomous regulation on frequency and strength of heart contractions and resistance of arterial vessels; process of formation of arterial pressure during systolic and diastolic phases; influence of respiration; synchronization between loops of autonomous regulation. The proposed model is used to simulate the dynamics of heart rate and arterial pressure during passive transition from supine to upright position. Results of mathematical modeling are compared to original experimental data.\n\nEpinephrine and left atrial and left ventricular diastolic function decrease in normal subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nFuenmayor, Abdel J; SolÃ³rzano, MoisÃ©s I; GÃ³mez, Luisangelly\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe assessed the effect of epinephrine over left atrial and left ventricular diastolic function in subjects without structural heart disease. Twenty-seven, 34.6Â±17.2year-old patients without structural heart disease were included. Intravenous epinephrine (50 to 100ng/kg/min) was infused. Left atrial and ventricular functions were evaluated by means of echocardiography before and during the epinephrine infusion. No complications were observed. Significant increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded. Both left atrial (minimal and maximal) volumes increased but increase in the minimal volume was more pronounced, and the ejection fraction diminished. Left atrial expansion index decreased and the fraction of left ventricular inflow volume resulting from atrial contraction increased. Two patients displayed abnormal left ventricular diastolic function. During epinephrine infusion, E/A and e' decreased, and isovolumetric relaxation time increased. In this group of young adults without structural heart disease, epinephrine infusion was safe, did not produce any complications, and induced a small but significant decrease in left atrial function and left ventricular diastolic function.

However, appropriate management of DHF patients remains a difficult and uncertain challenge. The Chronicle Offers Management to Patients with Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure (COMPASS-HF) trial was designed to evaluate whether an implantable hemodynamic monitor (IHM) was safe and effective in reducing the number of heart failure-related events (HFRE) in patients with chronic HF. The current study presents data on a prespecified and planned subgroup analysis from the COMPASS-HF trial: 70 patients with an EF > or =50% (ie, DHF). As such, this represents a subgroup analysis of the COMPASS-HF Trial. DHF patients were randomized to IHM-guided care (treatment) vs. standard care (control) for 6 months. All 70 patients received optimal medical therapy, but the hemodynamic information from the IHM was used to guide patient management only in the treatment group. The HFRE rate in DHF patients randomized to treatment was 0.58 events/6 months compared with DHF patients randomized to control, which was 0.73 events/6 months; this represented a 20% nonsignificant reduction in the overall HFRE rate in the treatment group (95% CI = -46, 56, P = .66). There was a 29% nonsignificant reduction in the relative risk of a HF hospitalization in the DHF patients randomized to treatment compared with DHF patients randomized to control (95% CI = -69, 70, P = .43). The IHM was shown to be safe and was associated with a very low system-related and procedure-related complication rate in DHF patients. However, in this subgroup analysis limited to 70 DHF patients, the addition IHM-guided care did not significantly lower the rate of HFR events. The results of this subgroup analysis in DHF patients, for whom there are currently no proven, effective management strategies, will be used to design future studies defining the\n\nSystolic and Diastolic Left Ventricular Mechanics during and after Resistance Exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nStÃ¶hr, Eric J; Stembridge, Mike; Shave, Rob; Samuel, T Jake; Stone, Keeron; Esformes, Joseph I\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo improve the current understanding of the impact of resistance exercise on the heart, by examining the acute responses of left ventricular (LV) strain, twist, and untwisting rate (\"LV mechanics\"). LV echocardiographic images were recorded in systole and diastole before, during and immediately after (7-12 s) double-leg press exercise at two intensities (30% and 60% of maximum strength, one-repetition maximum). Speckle tracking analysis generated LV strain, twist, and untwisting rate data. Additionally, beat-by-beat blood pressure was recorded and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and LV wall stress were calculated. Responses in both exercise trials were statistically similar (P > 0.05). During effort, stroke volume decreased, whereas SVR and LV wall stress increased (P < 0.05). Immediately after effort, stroke volume returned to baseline, whereas SVR and wall stress decreased (P < 0.05). Similarly, acute exercise was accompanied by a significant decrease in systolic parameters of LV muscle mechanics (P < 0.05). However, diastolic parameters, including LV untwisting rate, were statistically unaltered (P > 0.05). Immediately after exercise, systolic LV mechanics returned to baseline levels (P < 0.05) but LV untwisting rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). A single, acute bout of double-leg press resistance exercise transiently reduces systolic LV mechanics, but increases diastolic mechanics after exercise, suggesting that resistance exercise has a differential impact on systolic and diastolic heart muscle function. The findings may explain why acute resistance exercise has been associated with reduced stroke volume but chronic exercise training may result in increased LV volumes.\n\nLeft ventricular stiffness estimated by diastolic wall strain is associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in structurally normal hearts.\n\nPubMed\n\nUetake, Shunsuke; Maruyama, Mitsunori; Yamamoto, Teppei; Kato, Katsuhito; Miyauchi, Yasushi; Seino, Yoshihiko; Shimizu, Wataru\n\n2016-12-01\n\nLeft ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction depends on an impaired relaxation and stiffness. Abnormal LV relaxation contributes to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the role of LV stiffness in AF remains unclear. Diastolic wall strain (DWS), a load-independent, noninvasive direct measure of LV stiffness, correlates with prevalent AF. This study included 328 consecutive subjects with structurally normal hearts: 164 paroxysmal AF patients and 164 age- and sex-matched (1:1) controls. We calculated the DWS from the M-mode echocardiographic measurements of the LV posterior wall thickness at end-systole and end-diastole during sinus rhythm. The DWS was lower in the AF patients (0.35âÂ±â0.07) than in the controls (0.41âÂ±â0.06; P < 0.001). After adjusting for the risk factors of AF using a conditional logistic regression analysis, a history of hypertension, plasma brain-type natriuretic peptide level, and DWS were independently associated with AF prevalence, whereas body mass index, LV mass index, left atrial volume, and any conventional indices of the diastolic function were not. A low DWS (<0.380) was the strongest indicator of AF (odds ratio: 6.22, 95% confidence interval: 3.08-14.2, P < 0.001). Increased LV stiffness estimated by DWS was a strong determinant of the prevalence of AF. LV stiffness may play a role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal AF in structurally normal hearts.

Dietary soy protein and fish oil reduce kidney disease progression in the Han:SPRD-Cy model of cystic renal disease. However, the effects of these dietary interventions in preventing alterations in cardiac structure and function due to kidney disease (reno-cardiac syndrome) in a cystic kidney disease model are not known. Therefore, weanling Han:SPRD-Cy diseased (Cy/+) and normal (+/+) rats were given diets containing either casein or soy protein, and either soy or fish oil in a three-way design for 8Â weeks. Diseased rats had larger hearts, augmented left ventricular mass, and higher systolic and mean arterial blood pressure compared to the normal rats. Assessment of cardiac function using two-dimensional guided M-mode and pulse-wave Doppler echocardiography revealed that isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged in the diseased compared to normal rats, reflecting a diastolic heart dysfunction, and fish oil prevented this elevation. Soy protein resulted in a small improvement in systolic and mean arterial pressure but did not improve diastolic heart function, while fish oil prevented diastolic heart dysfunction in this model of cystic kidney disease.\n\nThe effect of deep-tissue massage therapy on blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaye, Alan David; Kaye, Aaron J; Swinford, Jan; Baluch, Amir; Bawcom, Brad A; Lambert, Thomas J; Hoover, Jason M\n\n2008-03-01\n\nIn the present study, we describe the effects of deep tissue massage on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. The study involved 263 volunteers (12% males and 88% females), with an average age of 48.5. Overall muscle spasm/muscle strain was described as either moderate or severe for each patient. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate were measured via an automatic blood pressure cuff. Twenty-one (21) different soothing CDs played in the background as the deep tissue massage was performed over the course of the study. The massages were between 45 and 60 minutes in duration. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance with post-hoc Scheffe's F-test. Results of the present study demonstrated an average systolic pressure reduction of 10.4 mm Hg (p<0.06), a diastolic pressure reduction of 5.3 mm Hg (p<0.04), a mean arterial pressure reduction of 7.0 mm Hg (p<0.47), and an average heart rate reduction of 10.8 beats per minute (p<0.0003), respectively. Additional scientific research in this area is warranted.\n\nVagal Nerve Stimulation Evoked Heart Rate Changes and Protection from Cardiac Remodeling.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgarwal, Rahul; Mokelke, Eric; Ruble, Stephen B; Stolen, Craig M\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThis study investigated whether vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to improvements in ischemic heart failure via heart rate modulation. At 7 Â± 1 days post left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation, 63 rats with myocardial infarctions (MI) were implanted with ECG transmitters and VNS devices (MI +âVNS, N = 44) or just ECG transmitters (MI, N = 17). VNS stimulation was active from 14 Â± 1 days to 8 Â± 1 weeks post MI. The average left ventricular (LV) end diastolic volumes at 8 Â± 1 weeks were MI = 672.40 Î¼l and MIâ+âVNSâ= 519.35 Î¼l, p = 0.03. The average heart weights, normalized to body weight (Â± std) at 14 Â± 1 weeks were MI = 3.2 Â± 0.6 g*kg(-1) and MIâ+âVNSâ= 2.9 Â± 0.3 g*kg(-1), p = 0.03. The degree of cardiac remodeling was correlated with the magnitude of acute VNS-evoked heart rate (HR) changes. Further research is required to determine if the acute heart rate response to VNS activation is useful as a heart failure biomarker or as a tool for VNS therapy characterization.\n\nLeft ventricular diastolic function in patients with treated haemochromatosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavidsen, Einar Skulstad; Omvik, Per; Hervig, Tor; Gerdts, Eva\n\n2009-02-01\n\nWe recently demonstrated reduced exercise capacity in phlebotomy treated genetic haemochromatosis in spite of normal systolic function. The present objective was to investigate diastolic function at rest. Diastolic function was echocardiographically assessed in 132 phlebotomy treated genetic haemochromatosis patients and 50 controls. Patients had higher body mass index and heart rate, higher transmitral early (E) (11.2+/-2.6 versus 10.4+/-2.2 cm) and atrial (A) (5.7+/-1.6 versus 5.0+/-1.6) velocity time integrals, pulmonary venous systolic peak velocity (0.58+/-0.12 versus 0.54+/-0.13 m/s) and ratio of E to spectral tissue Doppler E' velocity (6.3+/-1.6 versus 5.6+/-1.4, all p <0.05). Independently of age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and body weight, having haemochromatosis remained statistically significantly associated with higher E (beta=0.27) and A (beta =0.18) velocity time integrals, pulmonary venous systolic peak velocity (beta =0.21), and E/E'-ratio (beta=0.25) in separate multivariate analyses (all p <0.05). In the youngest age tertile, patients had longer isovolumic relaxation time and lower E' than controls. Our findings are compatible with mildly impaired diastolic function in treated haemochromatosis, with delayed relaxation in the younger tertile, and an elevated filling pressure and pseudonormalisation with increasing age.\n\nSynergistic role of ADP and Ca2+ in diastolic myocardial stiffness\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSequeira, Vasco; Najafi, Aref; McConnell, Mark; Fowler, Ewan D; Bollen, Ilse A E; WÃ¼st, Rob C I; dos Remedios, Cris; Helmes, Michiel; White, Ed; Stienen, Ger J M; Tardiff, Jil; Kuster, Diederik W D; van der Velden, Jolanda\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Heart failure (HF) with diastolic dysfunction has been attributed to increased myocardial stiffness that limits proper filling of the ventricle. Altered cross-bridge interaction may significantly contribute to high diastolic stiffness, but this has not been shown thus far. Cross-bridge interactions are dependent on cytosolic [Ca2+] and the regeneration of ATP from ADP. Depletion of myocardial energy reserve is a hallmark of HF leading to ADP accumulation and disturbed Ca2+ handling. Here, we investigated if ADP elevation in concert with increased diastolic [Ca2+] promotes diastolic cross-bridge formation and force generation and thereby increases diastolic stiffness. ADP dose-dependently increased force production in the absence of Ca2+ in membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes from human hearts. Moreover, physiological levels of ADP increased actomyosin force generation in the presence of Ca2+ both in human and rat membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Diastolic stress measured at physiological lattice spacing and 37Â°C in the presence of pathological levels of ADP and diastolic [Ca2+] revealed a 76Â Â±Â 1% contribution of cross-bridge interaction to total diastolic stress in rat membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of creatine kinase (CK), which increases cytosolic ADP, in enzyme-isolated intact rat cardiomyocytes impaired diastolic re-lengthening associated with diastolic Ca2+ overload. In isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, CK inhibition increased ventricular stiffness only in the presence of diastolic [Ca2+]. We propose that elevations of intracellular ADP in specific types of cardiac disease, including those where myocardial energy reserve is limited, contribute to diastolic dysfunction by recruiting cross-bridges, even at low Ca2+, and thereby increase myocardial stiffness. Key points Diastolic dysfunction in heart failure patients is evident from stiffening of the passive properties of the ventricular wall.

Heart rate and blood pressure of volunteers (n = 39, age = 25-40 years) was recorded following standard procedure. First, subjects had to sit comfortably in an easy and steady posture (sukhasana) on a fairly soft seat placed on the floor keeping head, neck, and trunk erect, eyes closed, and the other muscles reasonably loose. The subject is directed to inhale through both nostrils slowly up to the maximum for about 4 seconds and then exhale slowly up to the maximum through both nostrils for about 6 seconds. The breathing must not be abdominal. These steps complete one cycle of slow pace bhastrika pranayama (respiratory rate 6/min). During the practice the subject is asked not to think much about the inhalation and exhalation time, but rather was requested to imagine the open blue sky. The pranayama was conducted in a cool, well-ventilated room (18-20 degrees C). After 5 minutes of this breathing practice, the blood pressure and heart rate again were recorded in the aforesaid manner using the same instrument. The other group (n = 10) took part in another study where their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded following half an hour of oral intake of hyoscine-N-butylbromide 20 mg. Then they practiced the breathing exercise as stated above, and the abovementioned parameters were recorded again to study the effect of parasympathetic blockade on the same pranayama. It was noted that after slow bhastrika pranayamic breathing (respiratory rate 6/min) for 5 minutes, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly with a slight fall in heart rate. No significant alteration in both blood pressure and\n\nAdolescent obesity adversely affects blood pressure and resting heart rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaba, Reizo; Koketsu, Masaaki; Nagashima, Masami; Inasaka, Hiroshi; Yoshinaga, Masao; Yokota, Mitsuhiro\n\n2007-05-01\n\nObesity is associated with hypertension (HT) and high resting heart rate (HR), as well as metabolic disturbances. However, little is known about how strongly these hemodynamic abnormalities are associated with the degree of obesity in adolescents. Height, body weight, resting HR, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured in 20,165 male and 19,683 female high-school students. Adiposity levels were classified into 6 groups by body mass index: group 1 (<20th percentile), group 2 (20th-39.9th percentile), group 3 (40th-59.9th percentile), group 4 (60th-79.9th percentile), group 5 (80th-98.9th percentile), and group 6 (> or =99th percentile). Systolic and diastolic hypertensions were defined as > or =140 mmHg and > or =85 mmHg, respectively. Resting tachycardia was defined as the corresponding 95th percentile or greater. Resting HR and systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased with adiposity level in both sexes (p<0.0001). Both systolic HT and diastolic HT were associated with high resting HR, and the clustering of these unfavorable conditions increased with the degree of obesity. Hemodynamic abnormalities, such as HT and a high resting HR, are closely associated with adolescent obesity and are probably explained by impaired autonomic nerve function.\n\nBlood Pressure and Heart Rate Alterations through Music in Patients Undergoing Cataract Surgery in Greece.\n\nPubMed\n\nMerakou, Kyriakoula; Varouxi, Georgia; Barbouni, Anastasia; Antoniadou, Eleni; Karageorgos, Georgios; Theodoridis, Dimitrios; Koutsouri, Aristea; Kourea-Kremastinou, Jenny\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMusic has been proposed as a safe, inexpensive, nonpharmacological antistress intervention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients undergoing cataract surgery while listening to meditation music experience lower levels of blood pressure and heart rate. Two hundred individuals undergoing cataract surgery participated in the study. Hundred individuals listened to meditation music, through headphones, before and during the operation (intervention group) and 100 individuals received standard care (control group). Patients stress coping skills were measured by the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC Scale). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were defined as outcome measures. According to the SOC Scale, both groups had similar stress coping skills (mean score: 127.6 for the intervention group and 127.3 for the control group). Before entering the operating room (OR) as well as during surgery the rise in systolic and diastolic pressures was significantly lower in the intervention group (P < 0.001). Among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy, those in the intervention group presented a lower increase only in systolic pressure (P < 0.001) at both time recordings. For those patients in the intervention group who did not receive antihypertensive treatment, lower systolic blood pressure at both time recordings was recorded (P < 0.001) while lower diastolic pressure was observed only during entry to the OR (P = 0.021). Heart rate was not altered between the two groups in any of the recordings. Meditation music influenced patients' preoperative stress with regard to systolic blood pressure. This kind of music can be used as an alternative or complementary method for blood pressure stabilizing in patients undergoing cataract surgery.\n\nCardiac macrophages promote diastolic dysfunction.\n\nPubMed\n\nHulsmans, Maarten; Sager, Hendrik B; Roh, Jason D; Valero-MuÃ±oz, MarÃ­a; Houstis, Nicholas E; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Sun, Yuan; Wilson, Richard M; Wojtkiewicz, Gregory; Tricot, Benoit; Osborne, Michael T; Hung, Judy; Vinegoni, Claudio; Naxerova, Kamila; Sosnovik, David E; Zile, Michael R; Bradshaw, Amy D; Liao, Ronglih; Tawakol, Ahmed; Weissleder, Ralph; Rosenzweig, Anthony; Swirski, Filip K; Sam, Flora; Nahrendorf, Matthias\n\n2018-02-05\n\nMacrophages populate the healthy myocardium and, depending on their phenotype, may contribute to tissue homeostasis or disease. Their origin and role in diastolic dysfunction, a hallmark of cardiac aging and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, remain unclear. Here we show that cardiac macrophages expand in humans and mice with diastolic dysfunction, which in mice was induced by either hypertension or advanced age. A higher murine myocardial macrophage density results from monocyte recruitment and increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow and spleen. In humans, we observed a parallel constellation of hematopoietic activation: circulating myeloid cells are more frequent, and splenic 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging signal correlates with echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction. While diastolic dysfunction develops, cardiac macrophages produce IL-10, activate fibroblasts, and stimulate collagen deposition, leading to impaired myocardial relaxation and increased myocardial stiffness. Deletion of IL-10 in macrophages improves diastolic function. These data imply expansion and phenotypic changes of cardiac macrophages as therapeutic targets for cardiac fibrosis leading to diastolic dysfunction.

As myocardial energy metabolism is altered during obesity/T2D (increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation), we hypothesized that restricting myocardial glucose oxidation in lean mice devoid of the perturbed metabolic milieu observed in obesity/T2D would produce a cardiomyopathy phenotype, characterized via diastolic dysfunction. We tested our hypothesis via producing mice with a cardiac-specific gene knockout for pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, gene name Pdha1 ), the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose oxidation. Cardiac-specific Pdha1 deficient ( Pdha1 Cardiac-/- ) mice were generated via crossing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre expressing mouse under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (Î±MHC-MerCreMer) promoter with a floxed Pdha1 mouse. Energy metabolism and cardiac function were assessed via isolated working heart perfusions and ultrasound echocardiography, respectively. Tamoxifen administration produced an ~85% reduction in PDH protein expression in Pdha1 Cardiac-/- mice versus their control littermates, which resulted in a marked reduction in myocardial glucose oxidation and a corresponding increase in palmitate oxidation. This myocardial metabolism profile did not impair systolic function in Pdha1 Cardiac-/- mice, which had comparable left ventricular ejection fractions and fractional shortenings as their Î±MHC-MerCreMer control littermates, but did produce diastolic dysfunction as seen via the reduced mitral E/A ratio. Therefore, it does appear that forced restriction of glucose oxidation in the hearts of Pdha1 Cardiac-/- mice is sufficient to produce a cardiomyopathy-like phenotype, independent of the perturbed metabolic milieu observed in obesity and/or T2D.\n\nEchocardiographic evaluation of diastolic parameters in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarncarz, M A\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEchocardiography is a valuable tool for the evaluation of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. A high correlation between measurements of diastolic mitral inflow parameters analyzed with Doppler echocardiography and invasive methods makes the former valuable. The aim of this study was to ascertain if significant differences occur in diastolic myocardial parameters between dogs with no heart disease and dogs with subclinical or clinical dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore the aim of the study was to determine whether heart failure in dilated cardiomypathy is a result of systolic dysfunction alone or both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Eleven parameters were analyzed: E wave, E-AT, E-DT, E time, A wave, A-AT, A-DT, A time, E+A time, E/A ratio, and IVRT. The study confirmed the value of noninvasive echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy. Significant differences were found in E wave, E-AT, E time, E/A ratio and IVRT between healthy dogs and dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy. All are characterized by a significant decrease compared to healthy dogs after taking into account age and body weight except for the E/A ratio, which significantly increased in value. There were no significant changes in any of the Doppler parameters for diastolic evaluation in subclinical cases of DCM. Advanced heart failure in dilated cardiomyopathy entails systolic and diastolic dysfunction.\n\n[CARDIOREABILITATION PECULIARITIESÂ AND CORRECTION OF VIOLATIONS OF SISTOLIC, DIASOLIC FUNCTION AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME AND CORONARY ARTERY REVASCULARIZATION].\n\nPubMed\n\nShved, M; Tsuglevych, L; Kyrychok, I; Levytska, L; Boiko, T; Kitsak, Ya\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent coronary arteries revascularization, violations of hemodynamics, metabolism and heart rate variability often develop in the postoperative period, therefore, the goal of the study was to establish the features of disturbances and the effectiveness of correction of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and heart rate variability in stages of cardiorehabilitation in patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent coronary arteries revascularization. The experimental group included 40 patients with ACS in the postoperative period who underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of the coronary arteries (25 patients with ST-segment elevation ACS and 15 patients without ST-segment elevation ACS). The age of examined patients was 37 to 74 years, an average of 52.6Â±6.7 years. The control group consisted of 20 patients, comparable in age and clinico-laboratory manifestations of ACS, who underwent drug treatment with direct anticoagulants, double antiplatelet therapy, Î²-blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins. Clinical efficacy of cardiorespiratory process in patients of both groups was assessed by the dynamics of general clinical symptoms and parameters of natriuretic propeptide, systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle and heart rate variability. In the initial state, clinical and laboratory-instrumental signs of myocardial ischemia disappear in patients with ACS undergoing surgical revascularization of the coronary arteries, but clinical and subclinical manifestations of heart failure were diagnosed. The use of the accelerated program of cardiac rehabilitation already during the first month of studies leads to a decreasement of the signs of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, the level of NT-proBNP and improve in the variability of the heart rhythm wich significantly improves the life quality of patients with ACS. To monitor the effectiveness and safety of cardiac rehabilitation in\n\nAssociation of ACE gene D polymorphism with left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with diastolic heart failure: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBahramali, Ehsan; Rajabi, Mona; Jamshidi, Javad; Mousavi, Seyyed Mohammad; Zarghami, Mehrdad; Manafi, Alireza; Firouzabadi, Negar\n\n2016-02-09\n\nTo explore the association between ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension who have developed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Being a major contributor to the development of diastolic heart dysfunction, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and its genetic variations are thought to induce LVH in hypertensive hearts apart from haemodyn"
