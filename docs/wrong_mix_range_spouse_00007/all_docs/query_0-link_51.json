        "text": "Feasibility of transnasal endoscopy in screening for esophageal and gastric varices in patients with chronic liver disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Faria, Anderson AntÃ´nio; Dias, Carlos Alberto Freitas; Dias Moetzsohn, Luciana; de Castro Carvalho, Silas; Ferrari, Tereza Abreu; Nunes Arantes, Vitor\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and study aims âScreening for esophageal and gastric varices is indicated for patients with portal hypertension or cirrhosis. Typically, conventional endoscopy is used; however, the need for sedation increases the costs and risks, especially in cirrhotic patients. Use of transnasal endoscopy with an ultrathin endoscope enables study of the upper gastrointestinal tract without the need for sedation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of transnasal endoscopy in screening for esophageal and gastric varices in patients with chronic liver disease. Patients and methodsâ This was a prospective study in which transnasal endoscopy was carried out in patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension who had indications for screening of esophageal and gastric varices. The following variables were evaluated: demographical data, duration of procedure, patient tolerance and acceptance, adverse events (AEs), endoscopic findings and interobserver agreement related to portal hypertension alterations ( kappa index). Resultsâ A total of 50 patients entered the study. The most common cause of liver disease was chronic viral hepatitis (66â%). Among the cirrhotic patients, most of the patients were Child-Pugh A (74â%). In 5 patients (10â%), nasal intubation was not possible. Two patients (4â%) experienced minor epistaxis. Tolerance was excellent or good in 92â% according with a visual analogic scale. In 16 patients (32â%), esophageal varices were detected and in 2 patients (4â%) gastric varices were detected. The mean duration of the procedure was 7 minutes. Conclusionsâ Transnasal endoscopy is feasible, effective and well tolerated for screening of esophageal and gastric varices in patients with chronic liver disease. It can be performed in outpatient clinics safely and without the use of sedation.

Between 1992 and 2002, children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) and bleeding from esophageal varices received endoscopic injection sclerotherapy until eradication. Surveillance endoscopy was performed initially at 3 months and subsequently at intervals of 6 months to one year to detect esophageal and gastric varices, and PHG. Gastric varices were classified as gastroesophageal (GOV) or isolated gastric varices (IGV). Gastroesophageal varices included types GOV1 and GOV2 that extend along lesser and greater curvatures respectively. Patients who had recurrence of bleeding were evaluated by emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. 163 of 183 children who achieved esophageal variceal eradication were evaluated. Esophageal varices recurred in 40% cases. Primary gastric varices (before sclerotherapy) were seen in 61% cases [GOV 98% (83% GOV1, 15% GOV2) and IGV 2%] and secondary (after sclerotherapy) in 28% [GOV 71% (47% GOV1, 24% GOV2) and IGV 29%]. Secondary gastric varices were distributed as 20% GOV1, 42% GOV2 and 87% IGV. Frequency of gastric varices before sclerotherapy and at the last follow up showed decrease in GOV1 from 82 to 56 (P = 0.02), increase in GOV2 from 15 to 23 and increase in IGV from 2 to 15 (P < 0.001). PHG increased in frequency from 12% to 41% (P < 0.001) and severity from one patient to 12 (P < 0.001). Eleven cases had rebleeding from gastric varices (5 GOV1, 4 GOV2 and 2 IGV). Following esophageal variceal eradication in children with EHPVO a significant decrease in GOV1, increase in IGV and increased frequency and severity of PHG takes place. Small rebleeding risk persists from gastric varices irrespective of the type.\n\nGastric Varices Bleed at Lower Portosystemic Pressure Gradients than Esophageal Varices.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorrison, Joseph D; Mendoza-Elias, Nasya; Lipnik, Andrew J; Lokken, R Peter; Bui, James T; Ray, Charles E; Gaba, Ron C\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo quantify and compare portosystemic pressure gradients (PSGs) between bleeding esophageal varices (EV) and gastric varices (GV). In a single-center, retrospective study, 149 patients with variceal bleeding (90 men, 59 women, mean age 52 y) with EV (nÂ = 69; 46%) or GV (nÂ = 80; 54%) were selected from 320 consecutive patients who underwent successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation from 1998 to 2016. GV were subcategorized using the Sarin classification as gastroesophageal varices (GEV) (nÂ = 57) or isolated gastric varices (IGV) (nÂ = 23). PSG before TIPS was measured from the main portal vein to the right atrium. PSGs were compared across EV, GEV, and IGV groups using 1-way analysis of variance. Overall mean baseline PSG was 21 mm Hg Â± 6. PSG was significantly higher in patients with EV versus GV (23 mm Hg vs 19 mm Hg; P < .001). Mean PSG was highest among EV (23 mm Hg) with lower PSGs identified for GEV (20 mm Hg) and IGV (16 mm Hg); this difference was statistically significant (P < .001). Among 95 acute bleeding cases, a similar pattern was evident (EV 23 mm Hg vs GEV mm Hg 20 vs IGV 17 mm Hg; P < .001). At baseline PSG < 12 mm Hg, 13% (3/23) of IGV bled versus 9% (5/57) of GEV and 3% (2/69) of EVs (PÂ = .169). Mean final PSG after TIPS was 8 mm Hg (IGV 6 mm Hg vs EV and GEV 8 mm Hg; PÂ = .005). GV bleed at lower PSGs than EV. EV, GEV, and IGV bleeding is associated with successively lower PSGs. These findings highlight distinct physiology, anatomy, and behavior of GV compared with EV.

S.; Caldwell, Stephen H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the past 20 years, our understanding of the pathophysiology and management options among patients with gastric varices (GV) has changed significantly. GV are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension after esophageal varices (EV) and generally have more severe bleeding than EV. In the United States, the majority of GV patients have underlying portal hypertension rather than splenic vein thrombosis. The widely used classifications are the Sarin Endoscopic Classification and the Japanese Vascular Classifications. The former is based on the endoscopic appearance and location of the varices, while the Japanese classification is based on the underlying vascular anatomy. In this article, the authors address the current concepts of classification, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and emerging management options of gastric varices. They describe the stepwise approach to patients with gastric varices, including the different available modalities, and the pearls, pitfalls, and stop-gap measures useful in managing patients with gastric variceal bleed.

All the bands remained attached to varices at the completion of EGD. Despite apparent initial hemostasis, balloon tamponade was performed one hour later for suspected continued bleeding. Due to suspected continuing bleeding, EGD was repeated 4 h after initial EGD, and 3 h after balloon tamponade. This EGD revealed the esophageal varices; none of the bands remaining on esophageal mucosa; multiple mucosal stigmata likely from trauma at initial site of variceal bands before dislodgement; and 3 dislodged bands in gastric body, duodenal bulb, or descending duodenum. The patient expired 17 h thereafter from hypovolemic shock. This single report may suggest an apparently novel, balloon tamponade complication: dislodgement of previously placed, endoscopic bands. The proposed pathophysiology is release of bands by stretching entrapped, esophageal mucosa during esophageal balloon tamponade. This complication, if confirmed, might render balloon tamponade a less desirable option very soon after band ligation.\n\nGastric Varices: An Overview for the Gastroenterology Nurse.\n\nPubMed\n\nDale, Cheryl\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGastric varices can occur in as many as one-third of patients with portal hypertension. Within the nursing literature, however, articles focus on the management of esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastrointestinal bleeding with few publications about management of gastric varices. Given the advancement in therapies, it is prudent for gastroenterology nurses to have an understanding of its management and treatment options. This article reviews the pathophysiology, classification, and management of patients with gastric varices and outlines the importance of the nurse's role in the education and ongoing care for this patient group.\n\nFactors predicting the presence of esophageal or gastric varices in patients with advanced liver disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nZaman, A; Hapke, R; Flora, K; Rosen, H R; Benner, K\n\n1999-11-01\n\nRecently it has been recommended that all cirrhotic patients without previous variceal hemorrhage undergo endoscopic screening to detect varices and that those with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers (American College of Gastroenterology guidelines). However, endoscopic screening only of patients at highest risk for varices may be the most cost effective. Ninety-eight patients without a history of variceal hemorrhage underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy as part of a liver transplant evaluation. Univariate/multivariate analysis was used to evaluate associations between the presence of varices and patient characteristics including etiology of liver disease, Child-Pugh class, physical findings (spider angiomata, splenomegaly, and ascites), encephalopathy, laboratory parameters (prothrombin time, albumin, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, and platelets), and abdominal ultrasound findings (portal vein diameter/flow, splenomegaly, and ascites). The causes of cirrhosis among the 67 men and 31 women (mean age, 48 yr) included 28% Hepatitis C/alcoholism, 25% Hepatitis C, 13% alcoholism, 9% primary sclerosing cholangitis/primary biliary cirrhosis, 9% cryptogenic, 6% Hepatitis B, 1% Hepatitis B and C, and 9% other. Patients were Child-Pugh class A 34%, B 51%, and C 15%. Endoscopic findings included esophageal varices in 68% of patients (30% were large), gastric varices in 15%, and portal hypertensive gastropathy in 58%. Platelet count <88,000 was the only parameter identified by univariate/multivariate analysis (p < 0.05) as associated with the presence of large esophageal varices (odds ratio 5.5; 95% confidence interval 1.8-20.6) or gastric varices (odds ratio 5; 95% confidence interval 1.4-23). Platelet count <88,000 is associated with the presence of esophagogastric varices. A large prospective study is needed to verify and validate these findings and may allow identification of a group of patients who would most benefit from endoscopic screening for varices.\n\nBalloon-Occluded Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration of Gastric Varices: Concept, Basic Techniques, and Outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaad, Wael E. A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPatients with gastric variceal bleeding require a multidisciplinary team approach including hepatologists, endoscopists, diagnostic radiologists, and interventional radiologists. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the first-line diagnostic and management tool for bleeding gastric varices, as it is in all upper gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios. In the United States when endoscopy fails to control gastric variceal bleeding, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) traditionally is performed along the classic teachings of decompressing the portal circulation. However, TIPS has not shown the same effectiveness in controlling gastric variceal bleeding that it has with esophageal variceal bleeding. For the past 2 decades, the balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) procedure has become common practice in Asia for the management of gastric varices. BRTO is gaining popularity in the United States. It has been shown to be effective in controlling gastric variceal bleeding with low rebleed rates. BRTO has many advantages over TIPS in that it is less invasive and can be performed on patients with poor hepatic reserve and those with encephalopathy (and may even improve both). However, its by-product is occlusion of a spontaneous hepatofugal (TIPS equivalent) shunt, and thus it is contradictory to the traditional American doctrine of portal decompression. Indeed, BRTO causes an increase in portal hypertension, with potential aggravation of esophageal varices and ascites. This article discusses the concept, technique, and outcomes of BRTO within the broader management of gastric varices. PMID:23729982\n\nEndoscopic ultrasonography predicts early esophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nMen, Changjun; Zhang, Guoliang\n\n2017-04-01\n\nBleeding esophageal and gastric varices constitute a serious complication in liver cirrhosis. Previous studies have shown that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can be used to predict early esophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. We report a case of a 46-year-old man with hepatitis B liver cirrhosis (CTP score, 5; Child-Pugh class, A) who was admitted to our hospital due to a decreased appetite lasting 1 week. He was initially diagnosed with decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis; an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (PHT). Common endoscopic examination showed no evidence of gastroesophageal varices; EUS revealed distinct varices of the esophageal and gastric veins. Six months after discharge, the patient was rehospitalized because of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic ligation was implemented as well as esophageal varices loop ligature (EVL). Six months later, EUS showed obvious collateral and perforator veins. We should strongly recommend that patients with liver cirrhosis undergo EUS in addition to a routine endoscopic examination. EUS can play an important role in evaluating the risk for bleeding in PHT and can be used to assess the efficacy of EVL.\n\nEndoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) for Esophageal and Gastric Varices: How Can it Improve the Outcomes and Reduce Complications of Glue Injection\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBhatia, Vikram\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA large part of portal venous system and the paragastric and para-esophageal collateral circulation is within the reach of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The EUS is more sensitive than gastroscopy for the detection of gastric varices (GV), and can accurately distinguish GV from thickened gastric folds. Gastric varices are depicted by serpiginous, anechoic, Doppler-positive mural channels, with larger collateral channels visible outside the gastric wall. The EUS has also been used to monitor the completeness of GV obturation after glue injection. There are limited data that this strategy may be clinically beneficial to prevent GV re-bleed. The EUS has been used to deliver glue injections under real-time monitoring into the vascular channels, with or without steel coils as scaffolding for the glue. The potential advantages of this technique include a straight scope position, lack of hindrance from pooled blood in gastric fundus, smaller glue volume requirements, and precise intra-vascular placement of glue with avoidance of intramural injections, and reduced embolic complications. PMID:25755407\n\nA pathophysiologic, gastroenterologic, and radiologic approach to the management of gastric varices.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyan, Barbara M; Stockbrugger, Reinhold W; Ryan, J Mark\n\n2004-04-01\n\nGastric varices (GV) occur in 20% of patients with portal hypertension either in isolation or in combination with esophageal varices (EV). There is no consensus for optimum treatment of GV and because they comprise an inhomogeneous entity, accurate classification is vital to determine the appropriate management. Gastroesophageal varices (GOV) are classified as GOV1 (EV extending down to cardia or lesser curve) or GOV2 (esophageal and fundal varices). Isolated gastric varices (IGV) may be located in the fundus (IGV1) or elsewhere in the stomach (IGV2). GV possibly bleed less frequently than EV, but GV bleeding is typically difficult to control, associated with a high risk for rebleeding, and high mortality. Fundal varices, large GV (>5 mm), presence of a red spot, and Child's C liver status are associated with a high risk for bleeding. GOV1 have a much lower risk for bleeding. A portosystemic pressure gradient of > or =12 mm Hg is not necessary for GV bleeding, probably related to the high frequency of spontaneous gastrorenal shunts in these patients. GOV1 should be treated as for EV. First-line treatment of bleeding fundal varices is endoscopic variceal obturation. TIPS is currently second-line acute treatment and is used for prevention of rebleeding. The role of some newer interventional radiologic techniques requires further appraisal. This review describes the pathophysiology, diagnosis, natural history, endoscopic, and interventional radiologic treatment options for GV.\n\nLong-term outcome of 154 patients receiving balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration for gastric fundal varices.\n\nPubMed\n\nImai, Yukinori; Nakazawa, Manabu; Ando, Satsuki; Sugawara, Kayoko; Mochida, Satoshi\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThis study aims to clarify the long-term outcome of therapeutic strategies including balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) for patients with gastric fundal varices. The subjects were 154 patients with gastric fundal varices fulfilling the criteria for receiving B-RTO. In patients showing variceal bleeding, endoscopic therapies and/or balloon tamponade was performed to achieve hemostasis. B-RTO was accomplished with injection of 5% ethanolamine oleate through a standard balloon catheter except for patients with atypical varices, in whom a microballoon catheter was used to occlude drainage vessels other than a gastrorenal shunt. In patients complicated with esophageal varices at baseline, endoscopic therapies were performed following B-RTO. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration was performed successfully in 147 patients (95%), including 15 patients using a microballoon catheter. Complete variceal obliteration was achieved in all patients. Additional endoscopic therapies for esophageal varices were performed in 31 patients. Gastric varices did not recur in any of these patients. The cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5âyears after B-RTO were 91%, 76%, and 72%, respectively. Child-Pugh scores and hepatocellular carcinoma complication were identified as prognostic factors associated with survival rates. The cumulative exacerbation rates of esophageal varices at 1, 3, and 5âyears were 13%, 20%, and 27%, respectively, and rupture developed in six patients, which were successfully treated with endoscopic therapies. Therapeutic strategies including B-RTO with a microballoon catheter were useful to achieve a favorable outcome in patients with gastric fundal varices especially in those manifesting Child-Pugh class-A liver damage and/or those without hepatocellular carcinoma complication.

However, this practice may not be cost effective as large esophageal varices are seen only in 9-36% of these patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether clinical variables were predictive of the presence of large esophageal varices. This is a retrospective analysis of cirrhotics who had a screening upper endoscopy during an evaluation for liver transplantation at three different centers and who had not previously bled from varices. A multivariate model was derived on the combined cohort using logistic regression. Three hundred forty-six patients were eligible for the study. The prevalence of large esophageal varices was 20%. On multivariate analysis, splenomegaly detected by computed tomographic scan (odds ratio: 4.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-11.5) or by physical examination (odds ratio: 2.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.8), and low platelet count were independent predictors of large esophageal varices. On the basis of these variables, cirrhotics were stratified into high- and low-risk groups for the presence of large esophageal varices. Patients with a platelet count of > or = 88,000/mm3 (median value) and no splenomegaly by physical examination had a risk of large esophageal varices of 7.2%. Those with splenomegaly or platelet count < 88,000/mm3 had a risk of large esophageal varices of 28% (p < 0.0001). Our data show that clinical predictors could be used to stratify cirrhotic patients for the risk of large esophageal varices and such stratification could be used to improve the cost effectiveness of screening endoscopy.\n\n[Esophageal motor disorders in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices non-submitted to endoscopic treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nFlores, Priscila Pollo; Lemme, Eponina Maria de Oliveira; Coelho, Henrique SÃ©rgio Moraes\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe hepatic cirrhosis has as one of the main morbid-mortality causes, the portal hypertension with the development of esophageal varices, the possibility of a digestive hemorrhage and worsening of hepatic insufficiency. It is important to identify causal predictive or aggravating factors and if possible to prevent them. In the last years, it has been observed the association of esophageal motor disorders and gastro-esophageal reflux in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices. To study the prevalence of the esophageal motility disorders and among them, the ineffective esophageal motility, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and esophageal varices, without previous endoscopic therapeutic and the predictive factors. Prospectively, it has been evaluate 74 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis and esophagic varices, without previous endoscopic treatment. All of them were submitted to a clinical protocol, esophageal manometry and 55 patients also held the ambulatory esophageal pHmetry. Esophageal motility disorders have been found in 44 patients (60%). The most prevalent was the ineffective esophageal motility, observed in 28%. The abnormal reflux disease was diagnosed through the pHmetry in 35% of the patients. There were no correlation between the manometrical abnormality in general and the ineffective esophageal motility in particular and the esophageal or gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, the abnormal reflux, the disease seriousness, the ascites presence and the gauge of the varices. The majority of cirrhotic patients with non-treated esophageal varices present esophageal motor disorders. No predictive factor was found. The clinical relevance of these findings need more researches in the scope to define the real meaning of theses abnormalities.\n\nPlasma Prothrombin Time and Esophageal Varices in Patients with Cirrhosis of Liver.\n\nPubMed\n\nIslam, Md Nasirul; Khan, Mobin; Ahmad, Nooruddin; Mamun-Al-Mahtab; Karim, Md Fazal\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCirrhosis of the liver is a common complication of chronic liver disease and is associated with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. In this study, we checked the implication of prothrombin time, if any, in the genesis of esophageal varices. Sixty patients with cirrhosis of the liver were randomly assigned into two groups: Group I - 30 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices, and group II - 30 cirrhotic patients without esophageal varices. The prothrombin time was checked for both groups. A positive correlation was found between the prolonged plasma prothrombin time (> 4 seconds) and esophageal varices with a sensitivity of 56.67% and specificity of 73.33%. The Child-Pugh score showed a correlation; however, the size of varices did not exhibit any such relation. Prothrombin time may be cautiously used to assess portal hypertension in a field level and rural setting where endoscopy is not available or feasible.

Progression of anemia had been recognized at about age 70, and the patient was thus referred to our center in 2008 where secondary myelofibrosis was diagnosed based on bone marrow biopsy findings. Hematemesis due to rupture of esophageal varices occurred in January and February of 2011. The bleeding was stopped by endoscopic variceal ligation. Furthermore, in March of the same year, hematemesis recurred and the patient was transported to our center. He was in irreversible hemorrhagic shock and died. The autopsy showed severe bone marrow fibrosis with mainly argyrophilic fibers, an observation consistent with myelofibrosis. The liver weighed 1856 g the spleen 1572 g, indicating marked hepatosplenomegaly. The liver and spleen both showed extramedullary hemopoiesis. Myelofibrosis is often complicated by portal hypertension and is occasionally associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to esophageal varices. A patient diagnosed as having myelofibrosis needs to be screened for esophageal/gastric varices. Myelofibrosis has a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully decide the therapeutic strategy in consideration of the patientâs concomitant conditions, treatment invasiveness and quality of life.

The aim of the present work is to determine the prevalence of non-variceal UGIB as well as its different causes among the cirrhotic portal hypertensive patients in Nile Delta. Emergency upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy for AUGIB was done in 650 patients. Out of these patients, 550 (84.6%) patients who were proved to have cirrhosis were the subject of the present study. From all cirrhotic portal hypertensive patients, 415 (75.5%) bled from variceal sources (esophageal and gastric) while 135 (24.5%) of them bled from non-variceal sources. Among variceal sources of bleeding, esophageal varices were much more common than gastric varices. Peptic ulcer was the most common non-variceal source of bleeding. Non-variceal bleeding in cirrhosis was not frequent, and sources included peptic ulcer, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and erosive disease of the stomach and duodenum.\n\nEsophageal varices on computed tomography and subsequent variceal hemorrhage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSomsouk, Ma; To'o, Katherine; Ali, Mujtaba; Vittinghoff, Eric; Yeh, Benjamin M.; Yee, Judy; Monto, Alex; Inadomi, John M.; Aslam, Rizwan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose Endoscopy is recommended to screen for esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to identify features on abdominal CT imaging associated variceal hemorrhage (VH). Methods A caseâcontrol study was performed among patients with cirrhosis who had a CT scan. Consecutive patients who experienced VH were included as cases, and patients without VH served as controls. Two radiologists recorded the maximal esophageal varix diameter in addition to other measures of portal hypertension at CT. Results The most powerful CT parameter associated with VH was the esophageal varix diameter (5.8 vs. 2.7 mm, p < 0.001; adjusted OR 1.84 per mm, p = 0.009). 63% of individuals with VH had a maximal varix diameter â¥5 mm compared to 7.5% of cirrhotic patients without VH (p < 0.001). In contrast, the proportion of individuals whose largest varix was <3 mm was 7.4% among VH cases compared to 54.7% among controls (p = 0.001). The varix diameter powerfully discriminated those with and without VH (C-statistic 0.84). Conclusions A large esophageal varix diameter is strongly associated with subsequent VH. A threshold of <3 and â¥5 mm appears to identify patients with cirrhosis at low and high risk for hemorrhage.

To identify risk factors for GP growth and estimate its growth rate. GP growth rate was defined as the number of days since the first gastroscopy (without polyps) in the surveillance program, until the gastroscopy when a GP was discovered. Gastric polyp growth rates in CLD and CRS patients were similar. However, hyperplastic gastric polyps (HGPs) were detected more often (87.5% vs. 60.5%, P = 0.051) and at a higher number (2.57 Â± 1.33 vs. 1.65 Â± 0.93, P = 0.021) in the CLD patients. Subgroup analysis revealed the following findings only in CLD patients with HGPs: (i) a positive correlation between the GP growth rate and the patient's age; the older the patient, the higher the GP growth rate (r = 0.7, P = 0.004). (ii) A negative correlation between the patient's age and the Ki-67 proliferation index value; the older the patient, the lower the Ki-67 value (r = -0.64, P = 0.02). No correlation was detected between Ki-67 values of HGPs in CLD patients and the presence of portal hypertension, infection with Helicobacter pylori, or proton pump inhibitor use. In comparison with CRS patients, CLD patients developed HGPs more often and at a greater number. Young CLD patients may have a tendency to develop HGPs at a faster rate than elderly CLD patients.\n\nPlug-Assisted Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration for the Treatment of Gastric Variceal Hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Min-Yung; Kim, Man-Deuk; Kim, Taehwan; Shin, Wonseon; Shin, Minwoo; Kim, Gyoung Min; Won, Jong Yun; Park, Sung Il; Lee, Do Yun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (PARTO) to treat gastric variceal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension. From May 2012 to June 2014, 19 patients (11 men and 8 women, median age; 61, with history of gastric variceal hemorrhage; 17, active bleeding; 2) who underwent PARTO using a vascular plug and a gelfoam pledget were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and laboratory data were examined to evaluate primary (technical and clinical success, complications) and secondary (worsening of esophageal varix [EV], change in liver function) end points. Median follow-up duration was 11 months, from 6.5 to 18 months. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare laboratory data before and after the procedure. Technical success (complete occlusion of the efferent shunt and complete filling of gastric varix [GV] with a gelfoam slurry) was achieved in 18 of 19 (94.7%) patients. The embolic materials could not reach the GV in 1 patient who had endoscopic glue injection before our procedure. The clinical success rate (no recurrence of gastric variceal bleeding) was the same because the technically failed patient showed recurrent bleeding later. Acute complications included fever (n = 2), fever and hypotension (n = 2; one diagnosed adrenal insufficiency), and transient microscopic hematuria (n = 3). Ten patients underwent follow-up endoscopy; all exhibited GV improvement, except 2 without endoscopic change. Five patients exhibited aggravated EV, and 2 of them had a bleeding event. Laboratory findings were significantly improved after PARTO. PARTO is technically feasible, safe, and effective for gastric variceal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension.\n\nEsophageal varices on computed tomography and subsequent variceal hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSomsouk, Ma; To'o, Katherine; Ali, Mujtaba; Vittinghoff, Eric; Yeh, Benjamin M; Yee, Judy; Monto, Alex; Inadomi, John M; Aslam, Rizwan\n\n2014-04-01\n\nEndoscopy is recommended to screen for esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to identify features on abdominal CT imaging associated variceal hemorrhage (VH). A case-control study was performed among patients with cirrhosis who had a CT scan. Consecutive patients who experienced VH were included as cases, and patients without VH served as controls. Two radiologists recorded the maximal esophageal varix diameter in addition to other measures of portal hypertension at CT. The most powerful CT parameter associated with VH was the esophageal varix diameter (5.8 vs. 2.7Â mm, pÂ <Â 0.001; adjusted OR 1.84 per mm, pÂ =Â 0.009). 63% of individuals with VH had a maximal varix diameter â¥5Â mm compared to 7.5% of cirrhotic patients without VH (pÂ <Â 0.001). In contrast, the proportion of individuals whose largest varix was <3Â mm was 7.4% among VH cases compared to 54.7% among controls (pÂ =Â 0.001). The varix diameter powerfully discriminated those with and without VH (C-statistic 0.84). A large esophageal varix diameter is strongly associated with subsequent VH. A threshold of <3 and â¥5Â mm appears to identify patients with cirrhosis at low and high risk for hemorrhage.\n\nOutcomes of pregnancies complicated by liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuljic, Anela; Salati, Jennifer; Doss, Amy; Caughey, Aaron B\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices. We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 2,284,218 pregnancies in 2005-2009 recorded in the California Birth Registry database. Utilizing ICD-9 codes we analyzed the following outcomes for liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices in pregnancy: preeclampsia (PET), preterm delivery (PTD; <37 weeks), cesarean section, low birth weight (LBW; <2500âg), small for gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile), neonatal death (NND), and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Cirrhosis in pregnancy conferred an increased risk of PET, PTD, CS in multiparous women, LBW, and NND. Portal hypertension in pregnancy was associated with PTD, LBW, NND, and PPH. Non-bleeding esophageal varices in pregnancy were not associated with the outcomes assessed in a statistically significant manner. One case of bleeding esophageal varices was observed, resulting in PTD with a LBW infant. There were three cases of concomitant portal hypertension or concomitant esophageal varices with cirrhosis in pregnancy. Pregnancy in women with concomitant liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices can be successful. However, pregnancy outcomes are worse and may warrant closer antenatal monitoring and patient counseling. Cirrhosis in pregnancy with concomitant portal hypertension or esophageal varices is rare.\n\nPlug-Assisted Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration for the Treatment of Gastric Variceal Hemorrhage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChang, Min-Yung; Kim, Taehwan; Shin, Wonseon; Shin, Minwoo; Kim, Gyoung Min; Won, Jong Yun; Park, Sung Il; Lee, Do Yun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (PARTO) to treat gastric variceal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension.

PMID:26957908\n\nPrediction of esophageal varices and variceal hemorrhage in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nPubMed\n\nRockey, Don C; Elliott, Alan; Lyles, Thomas\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIn patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), identifying those with esophageal variceal hemorrhage prior to endoscopy would be clinically useful. This retrospective study of a large cohort of patients with UGIB used logistic regression analyses to evaluate the platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), AST to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR) and Lok index (all non-invasive blood markers) as predictors of variceal bleeding in (1) all patients with UGIB and (2) patients with cirrhosis and UGIB. 2233 patients admitted for UGIB were identified; 1034 patients had cirrhosis (46%) and of these, 555 patients (54%) had acute UGIB due to esophageal varices. In all patients with UGIB, the platelet count (cut-off 122,000/mm(3)), APRI (cut-off 5.1), AAR (cut-off 2.8) and Lok index (cut-off 0.9) had area under the curve (AUC)s of 0.80 0.82, 0.64, and 0.80, respectively, for predicting the presence of varices prior to endoscopy. To predict varices as the culprit of bleeding, the platelet count (cut-off 69,000), APRI (cut-off 2.6), AAR (cut-off 2.5) and Lok Index (0.90) had AUCs of 0.76, 0.77, 0.57 and 0.73, respectively. Finally, in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB, logistic regression was unable to identify optimal cut-off values useful for predicting varices as the culprit bleeding lesion for any of the non-invasive markers studied. For all patients with UGIB, non-invasive markers appear to differentiate patients with varices from those without varices and to identify those with a variceal culprit lesion. However, these markers could not distinguish between a variceal culprit and other lesions in patients with cirrhosis.

This study enrolled 341 patients who were consecutively diagnosed with and treated for bleeding gastric varices. The patients were divided into PPI and non-PPI groups, and their endoscopic findings, initial hemostasis outcomes, rebleeding and bleeding-related death rates, and treatment-related complications were analyzed. The rate of initial hemostasis was 97.1%. rebleeding occurred in 2.2% of patients within 2 weeks, 3.9% of patients within 4 weeks, 18.9% of patients within 6 months, and 27.6% of patients within 12 months of the GVO procedure. A previous history of variceal bleeding (relative risk [RR], 1.955; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.263 to 3.028; p = 0.003) and use of PPIs (RR, 0.554; 95% CI, 0.352 to 0.873; p = 0.011) were associated with rebleeding. Child-Pugh class C (RR, 10.914; 95% CI, 4.032 to 29.541; p < 0.001), failure of initial hemostasis (RR, 13.329; 95% CI, 2.795 to 63.556; p = 0.001), and the presence of red-colored concomitant esophageal varices (RR, 4.096; 95% CI, 1.320 to 12.713; p = 0.015) were associated with bleeding-related death. The prophylactic use of PPIs reduces rebleeding after GVO using NBC in patients with gastric variceal hemorrhage. However, prophylactic use of PPIs does not reduce bleeding-related death.\n\nEndoscopic variceal ligation for primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal hemorrhage in pre-liver transplant patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, Eu Jin; Gow, Paul J; Angus, Peter W\n\n2009-11-01\n\nEndoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is widely used to prevent esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with advanced cirrhosis. However, the safety and efficacy of EVL in this setting have not been clearly established. This study included 300 adult patients with cirrhosis on our liver transplant waitlist who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Esophageal varices deemed to be at high risk of bleeding were banded until eradication or transplantation. A retrospective review of patient notes and endoscopy databases was undertaken, and the number of banding episodes, complications, and patient outcomes were recorded. Forty-two of 300 patients presented with or had previous variceal bleeding prior to referral and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 258 patients, 101 underwent a total of 259 banding episodes (2.6 per patient) with a median follow-up post-banding of 18.4 months per patient (a total of 150 patient years). Failed prophylaxis occurred in 2 patients (2%), and there were 3 episodes (1.2%) of acute hematemesis from band-induced ulceration. One patient (1%) had mild esophageal stricturing post-banding without dysphagia. Four of 36 patients (11%) previously found to have moderately sized or larger varices that were not banded presented with hematemesis due to variceal bleeding and were subsequently banded. None of the patients that received banding died because of bleeding or failed to receive a transplant as a result of banding complications. This study shows that in liver transplant candidates, EVL is highly effective in preventing first variceal bleed. Although banding carries a small risk of band-induced bleeding, this rate is low in comparison with the predicted rate of variceal bleeding in this population.\n\nBleeding 'downhill' esophageal varices associated with benign superior vena cava obstruction: case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoudin, Michael; Anderson, Sharon; Schlansky, Barry\n\n2016-10-24\n\nProximal or 'downhill' esophageal varices are a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Unlike the much more common distal esophageal varices, which are most commonly a result of portal hypertension, downhill esophageal varices result from vascular obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). While SVC obstruction is most commonly secondary to malignant causes, our review of the literature suggests that benign causes of SVC obstruction are the most common cause actual bleeding from downhill varices. Given the alternative pathophysiology of downhill varices, they require a unique approach to management. Variceal band ligation may be used to temporize acute variceal bleeding, and should be applied on the proximal end of the varix. Relief of the underlying SVC obstruction is the cornerstone of definitive treatment of downhill varices. A young woman with a benign superior vena cava stenosis due to a tunneled internal jugular vein dialysis catheter presented with hematemesis and melena. Urgent upper endoscopy revealed multiple 'downhill' esophageal varices with stigmata of recent hemorrhage. As there was no active bleeding, no endoscopic intervention was performed. CT angiography demonstrated stenosis of the SVC surrounding the distal tip of her indwelling hemodialysis catheter. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty of the stenotic SVC segment with resolution of her bleeding and clinical stabilization. Downhill esophageal varices are a distinct entity from the more common distal esophageal varices. Endoscopic therapies have a role in temporizing active variceal bleeding, but relief of the underlying SVC obstruction is the cornerstone of treatment and should be pursued as rapidly as possible. It is unknown why benign, as opposed to malignant, causes of SVC obstruction result in bleeding from downhill varices at such a high rate, despite being a less common etiology of SVC obstruction.\n\nCircumferential suture technique for esophageal transection to treat esophageal variceal bleeding.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeng, L B; Chen, M F\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe EEA stapler has been used routinely for esophageal transection to treat esophageal variceal bleeding for some time. It carries the risk of postoperative leakage and is not suitable in those cases receiving recent sclerotherapy. The circumferential suture technique presented in this paper can be used in any situation requiring esophageal transection. It has been utilized by us in twenty-two emergent cases with good results.\n\nCustomization of laparoscopic gastric devascularization and splenectomy for gastric varices based on CT vascular anatomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKawanaka, Hirofumi; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Kinjo, Nao; Yoshida, Daisuke; Matsumoto, Yoshihiro; Harimoto, Norifumi; Itoh, Shinji; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Maehara, Yoshihiko\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic gastric devascularization(Lap GDS) and splenectomy (SPL) for gastric varices is technically challenging because of highly developed collateral vessels and bleeding tendency. We investigated the feasibility of customization of Lap GDS and SPL based on CT vascular anatomy. We analyzed 61 cirrhotic patients with gastric varices who underwent Lap GDS and SPL between 2006 and 2014. Lap GDS was customized according to the afferent feeding veins (left gastric vein (LGV) and/or posterior gastric vein (PGV)/short gastric vein (SGV)) and efferent drainage veins (gastrorenal shunt and/or gastrophrenic shunt, or numerous retroperitoneal veins) based on CT imaging. Thirty-four patients with efferent drainage veins suitable for balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) underwent B-RTO instead of surgical GDS, with subsequent Lap SPL. Among 27 patients with gastric varices unsuitable for B-RTO, 15 patients with PGV/SGV underwent Lap GDS of the greater curvature and SPL, and 12 patients with LGV or LGV/PGV/SGV underwent Lap GDS of the greater and lesser curvature and SPL. The mean operation time was 294Â min and mean blood loss was 198Â g. There was no mortality or severe morbidity. Gastric varices were eradicated in all 61 patients, with no bleeding or recurrence during a mean follow-up of 55.9Â months. The cumulative 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 92, 82, and 64%, respectively. Lap GDS and SPL customized based on CT vascular anatomy is a safe and effective procedure for treating gastric varices.\n\nBalloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration versus endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for isolated gastric varices: a comparative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nEmori, Keigo; Toyonaga, Atsushi; Oho, Kazuhiko; Kumamoto, Masafumi; Haruta, Tsuyoshi; Inoue, Hiroto; Morita, Yukihiko; Mitsuyama, Keiichi; Tsuruta, Osamu; Sata, Michio\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIsolated gastric varices (IGV) have a lower risk of bleeding than esophageal varices, however IGV bleeding is associated with a higher mortality than bleeding of esophageal varices. In recent years, two widely used treatments for IGV have been balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) and endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) using cyanoacrylate or ethanolamine oleate (EO). This study compared these two treatment methods for IGV. The subjects were 112 patients who were treated at our hospital for IGV bleeding between October 1990 and December 2003. Forty-nine (49) patients were treated with B-RTO and 63 patients with EIS. These two patient groups were compared as regards content of treatment, post-treatment incidence of variceal bleeding, incidence of IGV rebleeding, survival rate, cause of death, and complications. Multivariate analysis was performed on post-treatment variceal bleeding and survival. Although EO was used in higher amounts in the B-RTO group than in the EIS group, the B-RTO group had a significantly lower number of treatment sessions and a significantly shorter treatment period (p<0.05). The EIS group had significantly more patients with IGV rebleeding after treatment than the B-RTO group. Treatment method was the only independent prognostic factor of IGV bleeding after treatment (p=0.024). The two groups did not differ significantly in the percentage of patients with aggravated esophageal varices after treatment. Bleeding from ectopic varices was not observed in any patient. There was no significant difference in survival by treatment method. The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma was the only independent prognostic factor for survival (p=0.003). It is concluded that B-RTO was more effective than EIS in the eradication of IGV and prevention of IGV recurrence and rebleeding.\n\nSafety of direct endoscopic necrosectomy in patients with gastric varices\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStorm, Andrew C; Thompson, Christopher C\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To determine the feasibility and safety of transgastric direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) in patients with walled-off necrosis (WON) and gastric varices. METHODS: A single center retrospective study of consecutive DEN for WON was performed from 2012 to 2015. All DEN cases with gastric fundal varices noted on endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the admission for DEN were collected for analysis. In all cases, external urethral sphincter (EUS) with doppler was used to exclude the presence of intervening gastric varices or other vascular structures prior to 19 gauge fine-needle aspiration (FNA) needle access into the cavity. The tract was serially dilated to 20 mm and was entered with an endoscope for DEN. Pigtail stents were placed to facilitate drainage of the cavity. Procedure details were recorded. Comprehensive chart review was performed to evaluate for complications and WON recurrence. RESULTS: Fifteen patients who underwent DEN for WON had gastric varices at the time of their procedure. All patients had an INR < 1.5 and platelets > 50. Of these patients, 11 had splenic vein thrombosis and 2 had portal vein thrombosis. Two patients had isolated gastric varices, type 1 and the remaining 13 had > 5 mm gastric submucosal varices on imaging by CT, MRI or EUS. No procedures were terminated without completing the DEN for any reason. One patient had self-limited intraprocedural bleeding related to balloon dilation of the tract. Two patients experienced delayed bleeding at 2 and 5 d post-op respectively. One required no therapy or intervention and the other received 1 unit transfusion and had an EGD which revealed no active bleeding. Resolution rate of WON was 100% (after up to 2 additional DEN in one patient) and no patients required interventional radiology or surgical interventions. CONCLUSION: In patients with WON and gastric varices, DEN using EUS and doppler guidance may be performed safely.

Endoscopic color Doppler ultrasonography (ECDUS) was performed in 16 patients with gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion. This study retrospectively evaluated the role of ECDUS in the diagnosis of gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion. Thirteen patients had co-existing pancreatic diseases: 8 with chronic pancreatitis, 4 with cancer of the pancreatic body or tail and 1 with severe acute pancreatitis. Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 had myeloproliferative disease, 1 had advanced gastric cancer, and the third had splenic vein occlusion due to an obscure cause. The endoscopic findings of gastric varices were: variceal form (F) classified as enlarged tortuous (F2) in 12 cases and large, coil-shaped (F3) in 4 cases, and positive for erosion or red color sign of the variceal surface in 4 cases and negative in 12 cases. ECDUS color flow images of gastric variceal flow clearly depicted a round fundal region at the center, with varices expanding to the curvatura ventriculi major of the gastric body in all 16 cases. The velocities of F3 type gastric varices were significantly higher than those of the F2 type. The wall thickness of varices positive for erosion or red color sign was significantly less than the negative cases. I conclude that ECDUS color flow images of gastric variceal flow depicted specific findings of gastric varices secondary to splenic vein occlusion at the round fundal region at the center, with varices expanding to the curvatura ventriculi major of the gastric body.

He had been previously diagnosed to have idiopathic portal hypertension and esophageal varices, and had undergone an esophageal transection 8 years earlier. The pre-operative diagnosis was a suspected hemorrhage from the small intestine as visualized by 99mTc-HSAD scintigraphy (technetium 99m-labeled human serum albumin D-type) and was not considered to be repeated massive lower GI tract bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and intra-operative endoscopy revealed active bleeding from the jejunal varices. A partial resection of the small intestine resulted in a complete resolution of the bleeding. A review of the literature thereafter disclosed twelve previously reported cases of jejunal variceal bleeding.\n\nPropranolol, isosorbide mononitrate and endoscopic band ligation - alone or in varying combinations for the prevention of esophageal variceal rebleeding.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmad, Irfan; Khan, Anwaar A; Alam, Altaf; Butt, Arshad Kamal; Shafqat, Farzana; Sarwar, Shahid\n\n2009-05-01\n\nTo compare the efficacy of propranolol, propranolol with nitrate, band ligation, and band ligation with propranolol and nitrate for the prevention of esophageal variceal rebleeding. A prospective randomized trial. Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, from November 2003 to July 2005. One hundred and sixty cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding were randomized to four treatment groups (propranolol, propranolol plus isosorbide mononitrate, band ligation, band ligation plus propranolol and nitrate) with 40 patients in each group. Patients were followed for 6 months after the enrolment of last patient. Primary end points were recurrence of esophageal variceal bleeding and death. Treatment complications were noted. Four treatment groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristics. Esophageal variceal rebleeding occurred in 22% patients in band ligation plus drugs group, 26% patients in drug combination group, 31% patients in banding group and 38% patients in propranolol group (p=0.41). Difference in mortality rates was also not significant. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in prevention of esophageal variceal rebleeding.\n\nSevere bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaronna, Roberto; Bezzi, Mario; Schiratti, Monica; Cardi, Maurizio; Prezioso, Giampaolo; Benedetti, Michele; Papini, Federica; Mangioni, Simona; Martino, Gabriele; Chirletti, Piero\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA non cirrhotic patient with esophageal varices and portal vein thrombosis had recurrent variceal bleeding unsuccessfully controlled by endoscopy and esophageal transection. Emergency transhepatic portography confirmed the thrombosed right branch of the portal vein, while the left branch appeared angulated, shifted and stenotic. A stent was successfully implanted into the left branch and the collateral vessels along the epatoduodenal ligament disappeared. In patients with esophageal variceal hemorrhage and portal thrombosis if endoscopy fails, emergency esophageal transection or nonselective portocaval shunting are indicated. The rare patients with only partial portal thrombosis can be treated directly with stenting through an angioradiologic approach.

Measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PH and estimating the risk of varices and bleeding. In contrast, upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy (UGE) can reliably demonstrate the presence of varices and bleeding. Both measures are invasive, and HVPG is mainly restricted to tertiary centers. Therefore, the development of noninvasive methods of assessing the severity of PH and the risk of variceal bleeding is warranted. We retrospectively examined the correlation of spleen stiffness (SSM) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) with the incidence of variceal bleeding among 143 patients who underwent combined liver and spleen elastography between 2013 and 2015. For 19 of 103 patients (16.8%), upper GI variceal bleeding was diagnosed and treated endoscopically. The median SSM of all patients was 35.3 kilopascals (kPa); the median LSM, 11.7 kPa. Patients with previous bleeding episodes had significantly higher SSM (75.0 kPa) and LSM (37.3 kPa) than those without a history of bleeding (SSM, 30.6 kPa; LSM, 8.2 kPa; p < 0.0001). Seventy-five patients (66.4%) underwent UGE in addition to SSM and LSM: 25 with no esophageal varices (EVs; SSM, 29.5 kPa; LSM, 11.4 kPa), 16 with EV grade 1 (SSM, 35.9 kPa; LSM, 33.4 kPa), 21 with EV grade 2 (SSM, 67.8 kPa; LSM, 27.0 kPa) and 13 with EV grade 3 (SSM, 75.0 kPa; LSM, 26.3 kPa). No statistically significant differences were found between respective grades of EV but were found between the presence and absence of varices. At a calculated cutoff level of 42.6 kPa (with application of 95% CI), SSM had sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 64% in determining the risk of bleeding, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.97 (LSM sensitivity, 84%; LSM specificity, 80%; LSM NPV, 0.96 at LSM cutoff\n\nRegression of esophageal varices and splenomegaly in two patients with hepatitis-C-related liver cirrhosis after interferon and ribavirin combination therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Soon Jae; Cho, Yoo-Kyung; Na, Soo-Young; Choi, Eun Kwang; Boo, Sun Jin; Jeong, Seung Uk; Song, Hyung Joo; Kim, Heung Up; Kim, Bong Soo; Song, Byung-Cheol\n\n2016-09-01\n\nSome recent studies have found regression of liver cirrhosis after antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis, but there have been no reports of complete regression of esophageal varices after interferon/peg-interferon and ribavirin combination therapy. We describe two cases of complete regression of esophageal varices and splenomegaly after interferon-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis. Esophageal varices and splenomegaly regressed after 3 and 8 years of sustained virologic responses in cases 1 and 2, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that complications of liver cirrhosis, such as esophageal varices and splenomegaly, can regress after antiviral therapy in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis.\n\nPrediction of Esophageal Varices in Patients with Cirrhosis: Usefulness of Three-dimensional MR Elastography with Echo-planar Imaging Technique\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShin, Sung Ui; Yu, Mi Hye; Yoon, Jeong Hee; Han, Joon Koo; Choi, Byung-Ihn; Glaser, Kevin J.; Ehman, Richard L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose To determine the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography in comparison to spleen length and dynamic contrast materialâenhanced (DCE) MR imaging in association with esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis by using endoscopy as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This retrospective study received institutional review board approval, and informed consent was waived. One hundred thirty-nine patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent liver DCE MR imaging, including MR elastography, were included. Hepatic stiffness (HS) and spleen stiffness (SS) values assessed with MR elastography, as well as spleen length, were correlated with the presence of esophageal varices and high-risk varices by using Spearman correlation analysis. The diagnostic performance of MR elastography was compared with that of DCE MR imaging and combined assessment of MR elastography and DCE MR imaging by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. MR elastography reproducibility was assessed prospectively, with informed consent, in another 15 patients by using intraclass correlation coefficients. Results There were significant positive linear correlations between HS, SS, and spleen length and the grade of esophageal varices (r = 0.46, r = 0.48, and r = 0.36, respectively; all P < .0001). HS and SS values (>4.81 kPa and >7.60 kPa, respectively) showed better performance than did spleen length in the association with esophageal varices (P = .0306 and P = .0064, respectively). Diagnostic performance of HS and SS in predicting high-risk varices was comparable to that of DCE MR imaging (P = .1282 and P = .1371, respectively). When MR elastography and DCE MR imaging were combined, sensitivity improved significantly (P = .0004). MR elastography was highly reproducible (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.9). Conclusion HS and SS are associated with esophageal varices and showed better performance than did spleen length in assessing the presence\n\nThe international normalized ratio does not reflect bleeding risk in esophageal variceal hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nHshieh, Tammy T; Kaung, Aung; Hussain, Syed; Curry, Michael P; Sundaram, Vinay\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe international normalized ratio (INR) has not been validated as a predictor of bleeding risk in cirrhotics. The aim of this study was to determine whether elevation in the INR correlated with risk of esophageal variceal hemorrhage and whether correction of the INR prior to endoscopic therapy affects failure to control bleeding. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. Cases were cirrhotics admitted to the hospital due to bleeding esophageal varices. Controls were cirrhotics with a history of non-bleeding esophageal varices admitted with ascites or encephalopathy. All variceal bleeders were treated with octreotide, antibiotics, and band ligation. Failure to control bleeding was defined according to the Baveno V criteria. We analyzed 74 cases and 74 controls. The mean INR at presentation was lower in those with bleeding varices compared to non-bleeders (1.61 vs 1.74, P = 0.03). Those with bleeding varices had higher serum sodium (136.1 vs 133.8, P = 0.02), lower hemoglobin (9.59 vs 11.0, P < 0.001), and lower total bilirubin (2.47 vs 5.50, P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed total bilirubin to inversely correlate with bleeding (OR = 0.74). Bleeders received a mean of 1.14 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to endoscopy (range 0-11 units). Of the 14 patients (20%) with failure to control bleeding, median INR (1.8 vs 1.5, P = 0.02) and median units of FFP transfused (2 vs 0, P = 0.01) were higher than those with hemostasis after the initial endoscopy. The INR reflects liver dysfunction, not bleeding risk. Correction of INR with FFP has little effect on hemostasis.\n\nAn Unusual Reason for Gastric Variceal Hemorrhage: Wandering Spleen.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶seoÄlu, HÃ¼seyin; Atalay, Roni; BÃ¼yÃ¼kaÅÄ±k, Naciye Åemnur; CanyiÄit, Murat; Ãzer, Mehmet; SolakoÄlu, Tevfik; AkÄ±n, Fatma Ebru; Bolat, Aylin Demirezer; YÃ¼rekli, ÃykÃ¼ Tayfur; Ersoy, Osman\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWandering spleen is the displacement of the spleen due to the loss or weakening of the ligaments of the spleen and is seen very rarely with an incidence of less than 0.5Â %.

Endoscopic therapy is currently recommended for preventing gastroesophageal variceal rebleed. However, the rate of variceal rebleed and its associated mortality remain concerning. This study is aimed at differentiating patient response to endoscopic therapy based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings. One-hundred seventy patients previously treated with repeat endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis were enrolled and classified into two groups based on treatment response. Prior to consolidation therapy, all patients received an EUS examination to observe for extraluminal phenomena. All available follow-up endoscopic examination records were retrieved to validate study results. Of the 170 subjects, 106 were poor responders, while 64 were good responders. The presence of para-gastric, gastric perforating, and esophageal perforating veins was associated with poor patient response (pï¼0.001). The odds ratio for para-gastric veins was 5.374. Follow-up endoscopic findings for poor responders with incomplete variceal obliteration was closely correlated with the presence of para-gastric veins (p=0.002). The presence of para-gastric veins is a characteristic of poor response to endoscopic therapy for treating gastroesophageal varices. Early identification of this subgroup necessitates a change in course of treatment to improve overall patient outcome.\n\nSevere gastric variceal bleeding successfully treated by emergency splenic artery embolization.\n\nPubMed\n\nSankararaman, Senthilkumar; Velayuthan, Sujithra; Vea, Romulo; Herbst, John\n\n2013-06-01\n\nBleeding from gastric varices due to splenic vein obstruction is extremely rare in children, but it can be catastrophic. Reported herein is the case of a teenager with splenic vein thrombosis and chronic decompensated liver disease from autoimmune hepatitis who presented with massive gastric variceal bleeding. Standard medical management did not control the bleeding. Due to decompensated liver disease and continuous active bleeding, emergency partial splenic artery embolization was preferred over splenectomy or a shunt procedure. Bleeding was successfully controlled by partial splenic artery embolization by decreasing the inflow of blood into the portal system. It is concluded that emergency partial splenic artery embolization is a safer alternative life-saving procedure to manage severe gastric variceal bleeding due to splenic vein obstruction in a patient with high surgical risk. To our knowledge, only one other patient with similar management has been reported in the pediatric age group. Â© 2013 The Authors.

A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Naning; Wang, Xin; Zhang, Xiaoyin; Yao, Liping; Xie, Huahong; Zhang, Hongbo\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAchalasia is very uncommon, and rarely does achalasia co-exist with esophageal varices. We present a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with both achalasia and esophageal varices in December 2014 and had a past history of hematemesis. The patient's achalasia symptoms' Eckardt score was 9, and her hepatic function was Child-Pugh grade A6. After comprehensive assessment of the patient's health and discussion of the pros and cons of various therapies for achalasia, the patient underwent a peroral endoscopic myotomy. She was symptom-free after the operation and had no recurrence of achalasia symptoms at 20-month follow-up. No adverse events were reported. Peroral endoscopic myotomy for achalasia with esophageal varices has not been previously reported in the English literature.\n\nAlbumin and magnetic resonance imaging-liver volume to identify hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and esophageal varices\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Hang; Chen, Tian-Wu; Li, Zhen-Lin; Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Li, Cheng-Jun; Chen, Xiao-Li; Chen, Guang-Wen; Hu, Jia-Ni; Ye, Yong-Quan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAIM: To investigate whether liver lobe volume and albumin (ALB) could predict the presence and severity of liver cirrhosis, and esophageal varices. METHODS: Seventy-one cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B and 21 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. All the participants underwent abdominal enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to measure each liver lobe volume, and biochemical workup for testing ALB and Child-Pugh class. All cirrhotic patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to show the presence of cirrhotic esophageal varices. Right liver lobe volume (RV), left medial liver lobe volume (LMV), left lateral liver lobe volume (LLV), and caudate lobe volume (CV) were measured using enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The ratios of RV to ALB (RV/ALB), LMV to ALB (LMV/ALB), LLV to ALB (LLV/ALB) and CV to ALB (CV/ALB) were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether and how the combination of liver lobe volume measured using magnetic resonance imaging and albumin could predict the presence and severity of liver cirrhosis, and the presence of esophageal varices. RESULTS: RV, LMV, LLV and CV decreased (r = -0.51-0.373; all P < 0.05), while RV/ALB increased (r = 0.424; P < 0.05), with the progress of Child-Pugh class of liver cirrhosis. RV, LMV, CV, LLV/ALB and CV/ALB could identify presence of liver cirrhosis; LLV and LMV could distinguish Child-Pugh class A from B; RV, LMV, LLV, CV, RV/ALB and LLV/ALB could distinguish class A from C; RV and LLV/ALB could differentiate B from C; and RV, RV/ALB and CV/ALB could identify presence of esophageal varices (all P < 0.05). Among these parameters, CV/ALB could best identify the presence of liver cirrhosis, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.860, a sensitivity of 82.0% and a specificity of 83.0%. LLV could best distinguish class A from B, with an AUC of 0.761, a sensitivity of 74.4% and a specificity of 73.1%. RV could best distinguish class A from C\n\nvon Willebrand factor as a novel noninvasive predictor of portal hypertension and esophageal varices in hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Hao; Yan, Shiping; Wang, Guangchuan; Cui, Shaobo; Zhang, Chunqing; Zhu, Qiang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAt present, there is no perfect noninvasive method to assess portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Early predicting esophageal varices can provide evidence for managing cirrhotic patients. We aimed to further investigate von Willebrand factor (vWF) as a noninvasive predictor of portal hypertension, especially of esophageal varices. A total of 60 hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis and 45 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Levels of six markers were examined. All patients underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We evaluated the performance of six factors for diagnosis of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. The vWF levels in liver tissues were observed by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between the level of vWF in liver tissues and HVPG and between levels of vWF in tissues and plasma were examined. Cutoff values of plasma vWF (1510.5 mU/mL and 1701 mU/mL) showed high positive predictive value (PPV, 90.2% and 87.5%) in predicting clinically significant portal hypertension and severe portal hypertension. Cutoff values of vWF (1414 mU/ml and 1990 mU/mL, PPV 90.3% and 86.3%, respectively) were provided to detect the presence and degree of esophageal varices. Linear correlations were observed between levels of vWF in liver tissues and HVPG (r(2) = 0.552, p < 0.001) and between the level of vWF in liver tissues and in plasma (r(2) = 0.461, p < 0.001). The vWF is a noninvasive predictor of portal hypertension and esophageal varices in hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis. Increased levels of vWF in liver tissues may induce the elevated plasma vWF levels, but molecular mechanism is needed for further study.\n\nUpdates on esophageal and gastric cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGallo, Amy; Cha, Charles\n\n2006-05-28\n\nEsophageal and gastric cancers are both common and deadly. Patients present most often after disease progression and survival is therefore poor.

This study included 28 cirrhotic patients who underwent emergency prophylactic EVL and 41 who underwent an elective intervention between January 2009 and June 2014. Clinical outcomes were analyzed, including the rebleeding, 6-week mortality, and rebleeding-free survival rates. The rebleeding rate was higher in the emergency than in the elective group (28.6% vs. 7.3%, P =0.041). Multivariate analysis showed that emergency prophylactic EVL (odds ratio [OR] = 7.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.634.8, P =0.012) and Child-Pugh score C (OR=10.6, 95% CI=1.4-80.8, P =0.022) were associated with rebleeding. In the emergency group, the gastric varices were associated with rebleeding (OR=12.0, 95% CI=1.7-83.5, P =0.012). Emergency EVL may be associated with variceal rebleeding when blood clots are present in the stomach without active esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding or stigmata. Elective intervention should be considered as a safer strategy for preventing variceal rebleeding in this situation.\n\nEmergency treatment of esophageal varix incarceration in the endoscope and ligation device during endoscopic variceal rubber band ligation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhao, Hong; Cheng, Jilin; Xu, Yahong; Lu, Cuili; Huang, Shaoping; Fan, Zhenyu; Shi, Yuxin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSclerotherapy and endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) are commonly used to treat and prevent variceal bleeding. As of today, there has been no report on an unexpected incarceration of a varix hooked on with the bands from the endoscopic EVL device. We recently experienced this emergency while using the 7-band ring endoscopic EVL device (Boston Scientific Corp., Boston, MA) for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In this case, the varix body itself was accidently incarcerated in the crevice of the esophageal endoscope after highly negative pressure of absorption was applied on the endoscope. In this situation, using force to take out the gastroscope was not an option as it would tear the vein and cause massive hemorrhage. We were managed to ligate the varix with rubber bands while releasing the incarceration. We observed that ligation of the varix at the same position using all seven ligation bands resulted in disappearance of the targeted varix. The surrounding esophageal mucosa became smooth after the treatment.

A relevant proportion of patients with esophageal variceal bleeding remains refractory to standard therapy, thus making a call for additional tools to achieve hemostasis. Self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) incorporate such a tool. We evaluated a total number of 582 patients admitted to our endoscopy unit with the diagnosis \"gastrointestinal bleeding\" according to our documentation software between 2011 and 2014. 82 patients suffered from esophageal variceal bleeding, out of which 11 cases were refractory to standard therapy leading to SEMS application. Patients with esophageal malignancy, fistula, or stricture and a non-esophageal variceal bleeding source were excluded from the analysis. A retrospective analysis reporting a series of clinically relevant parameters in combination with bleeding control rates and adverse events was performed. The initial bleeding control rate after SEMS application was 100%. Despite this success, we observed a 27% mortality rate within the first 42 days. All of these patients died due to non-directly hemorrhage-associated reasons. The majority of patients exhibited an extensive demand of medical care with prolonged hospital stay. Common complications were hepatic decompensation, pulmonary infection and decline of renal function. Interestingly, we found in 7 out of 11 patients (63.6%) stent dislocation at time of control endoscopy 24 h after hemostasis or at time of stent removal. The presence of hiatal hernia did not affect obviously stent dislocation rates. Refractory patients had significantly longer hospitalization times compared to non-refractory patients. Self-expandable metal stents for esophageal variceal bleeding seem to be safe and efficient after failed standard therapy.

In this study, 26 cirrhotic patients with IGV were treated with devascularization surgery for variceal hemorrhage. Preoperatively, percutaneous transhepatic portography (PTP) and EUS were used to determine the mode of therapy for IGV. Fundectomy was performed for 14 patients with fundic IGV, whereas 12 patients with cardiac IGV underwent proximal gastrectomy. A significantly higher proportion of patients with cardiac varices showed grade 3 IGV on preoperative EUS than those who had fundic varices (p < 0.05). No major complications were observed during or after the operation, and only one patient died of prolonged shock and massive transfusion. Postoperatively, gastric varices had been eradicated completely in 25 of 26 patients, as determined by EUS study. During a mean follow-up period of 50 months, two patients had recurrent varices without bleeding, as demonstrated by EUS. The overall 5-year survival rate for the fundic IGV group was 67.9%, whereas that for the cardiac IGV group was 64.3% (p > 0.05). This study showed that devascularization surgery is highly effective for the prevention of recurrent bleeding from IGV and provides an alternative treatment method. Preoperatively, EUS is very helpful in detailed devascularization of patients with specific IGV, and may be used also for postoperative follow-up evaluation.\n\n[Recurrent variceal bleeding in a patient with portal and splenic vein thrombosis secondary to complex thrombophilia].\n\nPubMed\n\nÅawniczak, MaÅgorzata; Raszeja-Wyszomirska, Joanna; Marlicz, Wojciech; BiaÅek, Andrzej; Wiechowska-KozÅowska, Anna; Lubikowski, Jerzy; WÃ³jcicki, Maciej; StarzyÅska, Teresa\n\n2008-08-01\n\nThrombophilia in adults is one of main causes of portal vein thrombosis.

Summary Background Data Esophageal replacement in children is almost always done for benign disease and thus requires a conduit that will last more than 70 years. The organ most commonly used in the past has been colon; however, most series have been fraught with major complications and conduit loss. For these reasons, in 1985 the authors switched from using colon interpositions to gastric transpositions for esophageal replacement in infants and children. Methods The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 41 patients with the diagnoses of esophageal atresia (n = 26), corrosive injury (n = 8), leiomyomatosis (n = 5), and refractory gastroesophageal reflux (n = 2) who underwent gastric transposition for esophageal replacement. Results Mean Â± SE age at the time of gastric transposition was 3.3 Â± 0.6 years. All but two transpositions were performed through the posterior mediastinum without mortality or loss of the gastric conduit despite previous surgery on the gastric fundus in 8 (20%), previous esophageal operations in 15 (37%), and previous esophageal perforations in 6 (15%) patients. Complications included esophagogastric anastomotic leak (n = 15, 36%), which uniformly resolved without intervention; stricture formation (n = 20, 49%), all of which no longer require dilation; and feeding intolerance necessitating jejunal feeding (n = 8, 20%) due to delayed gastric emptying (n = 3), feeding aversion related to the underlying anomaly (n = 1), or severe neurological impairment (n = 4). No redo anastomoses were required. Conclusions Gastric transposition reestablishes effective gastrointestinal continuity with few complications. Oral feeding and appropriate weight gain are achieved in most children. Therefore, gastric transposition is an appropriate alternative for esophageal\n\nSafe and successful endoscopic initial treatment and long-term eradication of gastric varices by endoscopic ultrasound-guided Histoacryl (N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) injection.\n\nPubMed\n\nGubler, Christoph; Bauerfeind, Peter\n\n2014-09-01\n\nOptimal endoscopic treatment of gastric varices is still not standardized nowadays. Actively bleeding varices may prohibit a successful endoscopic injection therapy of HistoacrylÂ® (N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate). Since 2006, we have treated gastric varices by standardized endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided Histoacryl injection therapy without severe adverse events. We present a large single-center cohort over 7 years with a standardized EUS-guided sclerotherapy of all patients with gastric varices. Application was controlled by fluoroscopy to immediately detect any glue embolization. Only perforating veins located within the gastric wall were treated. In the follow up, we repeated this treatment until varices were eradicated. Utmost patients (36 of 40) were treated during or within 24 h of active bleeding. About 32.5% of patients were treated while visible bleeding. Histoacryl injection was always technically successful and only two patients suffered a minor complication. Acute bleeding was stopped in all patients. About 15% (6 of 40) of patients needed an alternative rescue treatment in the longer course. Three patients got a transjugular portosystemic shunt and another three underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation. Mean long-term survival of 60 months was excellent. Active bleeding of gastric varices can be treated successfully without the necessity of gastric rinsing with EUS-guided injection of Histoacryl.\n\nProspective study of bacteremia rate after elective band ligation and sclerotherapy with cyanoacrylate for esophageal varices in patients with advanced liver disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonilha, Danielle Queiroz; Correia, Lucianna Motta; Monaghan, Marie; Lenz, Luciano; Santos, Marcus; Libera, Ermelindo Della\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBand ligation (BL) is the most appropriate endoscopic treatment for acute bleeding or prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding. Sclerotherapy with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (CY) can be an alternative for patients with advanced liver disease. Bacteremia is an infrequent complication after BL while the bacteremia rate following treatment with CY for esophageal varices remains unknown. To evaluate and compare the incidence of transient bacteremia between cirrhotic patients submitted to diagnostic endoscopy, CY and BL for treatment of esophageal varices. A prospective study comprising the period from 2004 to 2007 was conducted at Hospital of Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo, UNIFESP, SP, Brazil. Cirrhotic patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh B or C) were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according treatment: BL Group (patients undergoing band ligation, n = 20) and CY Group (patients receiving cyanoacrylate injection for esophageal variceal, n = 18). Cirrhotic patients with no esophageal varices or without indication for endoscopic treatment were recruited as control (diagnostic group n = 20). Bacteremia was evaluated by blood culture at baseline and 30 minutes after the procedure. After 137 scheduled endoscopic procedures, none of the 58 patients had fever or any sign suggestive of infection. All baseline cultures were negative. No positive cultures were observed after CY or in the control group - diagnostic endoscopy. Three (4.6 %) positive cultures were found out of the 65 sessions of band ligation (P = 0.187). Two of these samples were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which could be regarded as a contaminant. The isolated microorganism in the other case was Klebsiella oxytoca. The patient in this case presented no evidence of immunodeficiency except liver disease. There was no significant difference in bacteremia rate between these three groups.

Several studies have shown the safety and efficacy of cyanoacrylate (CA) injection for acute gastric variceal hemorrhage. We report data from our experience with CA injection for GV before and after routine use of post-injection audible Doppler assessment (ADA) for GV obturation and describe long-term outcomes after this therapy. We retrospectively identified patients who had documented GV, underwent CA injection, and had at least 2Â weeks of follow-up. We recorded and analyzed the survival and rebleeding rates with patient demographics, clinical data, and endoscopy findings between two groups of patients who were categorized by CA injection prior to and after inception of the ADA technique. Seventy-one patients were identified with 16 patients analyzed in a group where ADA was not used (Pre-ADA) and 55 analyzed where ADA was used (Post-ADA). No rebleeding events were observed within 1Â week of initial CA injection. No embolic events were reported after any initial CA injection within 4Â weeks. The rate of bleed-free survival at 1Â year was 69.6% in the Pre-ADA group and 85.8% in the Post-ADA without statistical significance. The all-cause 1-year mortality was 13.8% in the Pre-ADA group and 10.7% in the Post-ADA group without statistical significance. ADA of CA-injected GV does not appear to significantly affect adverse events or clinical outcomes; however, our findings are limited by small sample size and cohort proportions allowing for significant type II statistical error. Further prospective investigation is required to determine the impact of ADA on clinical outcomes after GV obturation.\n\nCreatinine-modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh score is a good predictor of a short-term survival in patients with bleeding from esophageal varices.\n\nPubMed\n\nRadisavljeviÄ, Mirjana; BjelakoviÄ, Goran; JoviÄ, Jasna; RadovanoviÄ-DiniÄ, Biljana; Benedoto-Stojanov, Danijela; BrzaÄki, Vesna; MarkoviÄ-Å½ivkoviÄ, Bojana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBleeding from esophageal varices is a significant factor in mortality of patients with terminal liver cirrhosis. This complication is a major health problem for recipients on the list for liver transplant. In that regard, studying predictors of variceal bleeding episode is very important. Also, it is important to find the best survival predictor among prognostic scores. The aim of the study was to compare validity of prognostic scores in assessment of survival in hospital-treated patients after bleeding from esophageal varices, and to compare validity of baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Modul for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores with CTP creatinine modified (CTP-crea) I and II scores in assessment of survival in patients within a long-term follow-up period after the episode of bleeding from esophageal varices. The study included a total of 126 patients suffering from terminal liver cirrhosis submited to testing CTP score score I and II, MELD score, MELD Na score, integrated MELD score, MELD sodium (MESO) index, United Kingdom Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) score and updated MELD score. Patients with bleeding from esophageal varices most often had CTP score rank C (46,9%). CTP score rank B had 37.5% patients, while the smallest percentage of patients had CTP rank A, 15.6% of them. Patients who have values of CTP score higher than 10.50 and bleeding from esophagus, have 3.2 times higher chance for death outcome compared to other patients. Patients who have values of CTP-crea I score higher than 10.50 and bleeding from esophagus, have 3.1 times higher chance for death out-come than other patients. Patients who have values of CTP-crea II score higher than 11.50 and bleeding from esophagus, have 3,7 times higher chance for death outcome compared to other patients. Survival of patients with bleeding from esophageal varices in the short-term follow up can be predicted by following CTP score and creatinine modified CTP scores.

However it is not clear if this procedure is associated with less early and late mortality than sclerotherapy. To assess rates of re-bleeding and mortality in cohorts of patients with bleeding esophageal varices treated with endoscopic injection or band ligation. Analysis of medical records and endoscopy reports of two cohorts of patients with bleeding esophageal varices, treated between 1990 and 2010. Of these, 54 patients were treated with sclerotherapy and 90 patients with band ligation. A third cohort of 116 patients that did not require endoscopic treatment, was included. The mean analyzed follow up period was 2.5 years (range 1-16). Collection of data was retrospective for patients treated with sclerotherapy and prospective for patients treated with band ligation. Rates of re-bleeding and medium term mortality were assessed. During the month ensuing the first endoscopic treatment, re-bleeding was recorded in 39 and 72% of patients treated with band ligation and sclerotherapy, respectively (p < 0.01). The relative risk of bleeding after band ligation was 0.53 (95% confidence limits 0.390.73). Death rates until the end of follow up were 20 and 48% among patients with treated with band ligation and sclerotherapy, respectively (p < 0.01), with a relative risk of dying for patients subjected to band ligation of 0.41 (95% confidence limits 0.25-0.68). Band ligation was associated with lower rates of re-bleeding and mortality in these cohorts of patients.\n\nGastric varices and hepatic encephalopathy: treatment with vascular plug and gelatin sponge-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration--a primary report.\n\nPubMed\n\nGwon, Dong Il; Ko, Gi-Young; Yoon, Hyun-Ki; Sung, Kyu-Bo; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Shin, Ji Hoon; Ko, Heung Kyu; Song, Ho-Young\n\n2013-07-01\n\nTo evaluate technical safety, clinical safety, and effectiveness of vascular plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (RTO) for treatment of gastric varices (GV) and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; written informed consent was waived. From April 2009 to December 2011, 20 patients (13, GV; seven, HE) who had undergone vascular plug-assisted RTO were retrospectively evaluated. After retrograde transvenous placement of a vascular plug in the left adrenal vein or gastrorenal shunt, subsequent gelatin-sponge embolization of both gastrorenal shunt and GV was performed. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were performed; clinical and laboratory data were collected to evaluate primary (technical success, complications, clinical success) and secondary (change of liver function by using the Child-Pugh score, worsening of esophageal varices) end po"
