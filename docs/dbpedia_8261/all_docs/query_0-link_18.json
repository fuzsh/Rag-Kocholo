This Nancy Gion was a sister of Judge Gion, founder of the Gion steamship line of New York. She died when her children were quite young, but her husband, Robert Montgomery, lived to be 107 years old.\n\nThe above mentioned James Graham and his wife Jane (Montgomery) Graham, lived in Drumfame (about two miles north of Ballymena), County Antrim, Ireland. He emigrated to America about 1837 and died soon afterwards from the effect of sunstroke at East Greenwich, N. Y., and is supposed to have been buried in the Old Cemetery, Salem, N. Y. His wife Jane (Montgomery) Graham moved from County Antrim to Hollywood, County Down, where she supported herself and three children by keeping a small store. She had always been strong and vigorous and remained so until the end, except her eyes had almost failed her. She passed away Nov. 5, 1895, at the age of 89 years. To this James and Jane (Montgomery) Graham were born three children:\n\nNancy, b. Nov. 12, 1825, in Drumfame, County Antrim, Ireland, m. James Shields of Ahoghill, Nov. 2, 1845. She followed her husband to America in 1855 and returned to Ireland during the summer of 1892 to visit her mother and other relatives. She d. Jan. 12, 1916, in the home of her daughter, Mrs. Geo. T. Bruce, Albany, N. Y. See record of James Shields, third generation, herein.\n\nRobert H., b. as per the record of First Presbyterian Church, Ballymena, Ireland, as follows: \"Child's name Robert H.; Father's name James Graham; Mother's name Jane Montgomery; Birth 8th Sept. 1827; Certified by me, Robert Crawford Sessin, Clerk, July 7, 1910.\" He died March 22, 1915, in a hospital in Wichita, Kansas. Advised by Harper, Kans., Lodge, 191, I. O. O. F., Aug. 14, 1915, to Ivan Lacher, Wymore, Neb. He emigrated\n\n[next page]\n\n[photo of:]\n\nMrs. James Graham\n\n(Jane Montgomery)\n\n[Page 39]\n\nto America in 1856 and after a brief stay in Salem, N. Y., he journeyed westward.\n\nWhen he left Salem, N. Y., he located for a time at Jamestown, N. Y., and afterwards at Iowa City, Iowa, but shortly returned to Jamestown and married Jane Gowan, of County Wexford, Ireland, on Dec. 11, 1857 (b. on Easter Sunday, Apr. 19, 1835).\n\nIn the Spring of 1858 he went down the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers on a raft of logs with an Indian pilot and a drinking captain. At Ohio Falls they waited for high water to go over the falls with the raft. When over the falls they went to Cairo, Mo., and back to Mound City, Mo., where he bought a lot and was given another lot if he would build a house 16 x 24, but the house did not comply with the requirements and he sold the house and one lot and removed to Jersey Landing, afterwards called Else, Ill.\n\nHe later located at Jerseyville, Ill., where he remained 24 years. While at Jerseyville, he enlisted, Feb., 1865, in E Company, 152nd Regiment, Illinois Volunteers, 2nd Div., 20th Brigade, Army of the Cumberland, Gen. E. N. Dudley. They were with General Sherman in his march \"From Atlanta to the Sea.\" Mustered out Sept. 11, 1865, at Memphis, Tenn. Discharged at Springfield, Ill. He returned to his home and family at Jerseyville, Ill., and became Deputy Sheriff, which office he held for 16 years.\n\nLater with his family he located in Harper, Kans., where he spent the rest of his life, dealer in real estate, etc.\n\nOne June 18, 1910, he sailed from New York to Ireland, and there visited his old home town, Ballymena, lodge and friends, and returned to Harper, Kans. He was a member of G. A. R. and I. O. O. F.\n\nThey had five children, two of whom passed away, the other three, John Hunter Graham, Mima Graham and Robert Graham live in Harper, Kansas.\n\nEllen Graham m. John Williams, an Englishman. She d. Sept. 28, 1884, and is buried in Finchley Cemetery, near London, England.\n\n[Page 40]\n\nTHE CRAIG FAMILY\n\nJohn Craig was the son of James Craig and Elizabeth Montgomery, his wife, of County Antrim, Ireland. This Elizabeth (Montgomery) Craig, mother of John Craig, was a sister of Jane (Montgomery) Graham, mother of Nancy Graham Shields, Robert H. Graham and Ellen (Graham) Williams. Therefore, John Craig and the Grahams were first cousins.\n\nJohn Craig married Matilda Montgomery and emigrated to America and was for many years a trunk manufacturer on lower Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y. She died about 1870. He died about 1872. Both are buried in Greenwood Cemetery. To them were born four children: John, James, Charles and Mary. For several years the family spent the summers with their cousins, Mr. and Mrs. James Shields, in Salem, N. Y.\n\nDuring one of those summers, their eldest son, John Craig, and his cousin, James Shields, were drowned July 29, 1863, while bathing in Hedges Pond, Jackson, N. Y., each 11 years old.\n\nThe other children, James, Charles, Mary, and their mother, continued their visits for several years, yet neither family ever fully recovered from the sad effect, the loss of their eldest sons by drowning.\n\nAfter the death of their mother and father in 1870 and 1872, James, Charles and their sister Mary, continued to make their home in Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n[Page 41]\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nIn compiling the foregoing record, I have in a large measure lived over again my boyhood and young manhood days, and with a far greater appreciation than I had in the passing years for those who lived, loved and struggled through the difficulties and hardships, which time and developments have now eliminated.\n\nThis record is dedicated to those who may care to know something of their ancestors, without the necessity of wandering among tombstones to obtain it.\n\nRobert J. Shields\n\nNew York, N. Y.,\n\nDecember, 1930.\n\n[next page]\n\n[photo w/ caption:]\n\n\"So as we look behind us, life appears\n\nSeen through the visits of our bygone years.\"\n\nSource: Daniel Shields of County Antrim, Ireland and his descendants in America, by Robert J.
