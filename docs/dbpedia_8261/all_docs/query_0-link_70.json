        "text": "New Thread, I am researching my Mother's family in Australia , her Grandparents came from England and Ireland. and I would appreciate some help from the Forum who have helped so much with my Donnelly research over the past few years.\n\nMy Mother's name was Kathleen Florence Donnelly (born Street) in Melbourne Australia in 1908. Her father was Patrick James Street Born 1869 , in Melbourne Australia son of Charles Thomas (Traloney ) Street born Weymouth Dorset about 1815. He came to Australia about 1849/50 , settled in Potland Victoria where he married Catherine Shields in 1851.\n\nThis is where the confusion starts!! Catherine Shields was born in Aboghill Ireland 1n 1823 but her parents name was apparently Boyd. I don't know if she (Catherine ) was widowed when married 1n Australia in 1851 or was adopted by the Boyd or ,Shields families!! The only other information I have is the Boyd family were possibly from Scotland!! I believe there is no doubt a solution to this riddle and hope some of the excellent researchers in the Forum can help me.\n\nKind regards Bernie Donnelly Australia.\n\nHi Christina, thank you, I don't have much to go on , I am not certain where the info came from . My research is only based on info I was given many years ago and it just shows up when I look at the marriage of Charles to Catherine.in 1851 .I have never attempted to get a copy of the marriage certificate.\n\nWould the details of her birth be a better way to try and solve the problem. I am fairly sure that her birth details are correct born 1823 1n Aboghill Antrim Northern Ireland . Would it be possible for the Forum researchers to check those details.\n\nThanks for your help , Regards Bernie.\n\nHi\n\nFirst of all I have moved this subject to a thread of its own to the General Irish Family History forum.\n\nPlease note that I have given it the title Cath Shields b1823. I have done this because the marriage and death records I have found for her give her first name as Cath not Catherine. it is the same for her mother's name on Cath jnr's death reg also. This may make a difference when searching for her. it may have been assumed by previous researchers that Cath was short for Catherine but that may not be so and us assuming it is could take us down the wrong family line.\n\nAnother question - where did the information come from that Cath/erine was born in Aboghill Ireland.\n\nAnd in answer to your question about trying to find Cath/erine's birth and solve the problem that way - that is not how genealogy works. We have to work backwards so the first certificate to purchase would be Cath Street's death certificate and hope that it gives her marriage/s, and how long in the colony or indeed if she was also born in Australia. The marriage certificate is also another to purchase, These are a bit hit and miss with the information they contain but you will not know until you have it.\n\nHaving all the information contained in these two certificates will help us move back to Cath/erine's parents more confidently.\n\nI see that Cath Shields father's name is given as Boyd Danl on the transcription of her death registration.\n\nChristina\n\nThere is a New South Wales Assisted Immigrant Passenger List record for ship \"Cornwall\" which departed from Plymouth and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 11 August 1848 1848 as follows:\n\nCatherine SHIELDS aged 24 House & Dairy Maid Native place: Antrim Religion: Roman Catholic Read only\n\nAustralian Electoral Roll record for 1903 wherein a Catherine STREET is living at 120 Lord Street, Richmond, Victoria, performing home duties.\n\nNow this may be totally unconnected, but the father's forename jumped out at me. Baptism at Dromore, Co Down on 16 March 1825 of a Catherine daughter of Daniel SHIELDS & Mager? Subsequent baptisms for other children at Dromore, i.e. John 1826, Elizabeth 1829 & Denis 1832, show the mother to be Margaret MAGER and there is a marriage at Dromore in 1822 between Daniel SHIELDS & Margaret MAGER. All of these records are available to view via Ancestry.\n\nAh, now could this 1851 census record of Antrim be relevant, given that the Passenger List record for Catherine SHIELDS showed her to be of Antrim:\n\nCharlotte Street, Antrim, lists a household with, amongst others resident there, a Daniel SHIELDS, 13, & a John SHIELDS, 18.\n\nHowever, as Christina has said in the post above, anything we find at the moment is speculation until you have purchased death & marriage certificates.\n\nJanet\n\nHI Janet, thanks for your help so far , I am sure there is still a lot to sort out.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the details about Catherine Shields I sent to Christina. I have not heard back from her , because she may not have received the email. I hope this information may help to identify some of the queries in your thread, please let me know what you think.\n\nHi Christina, I am sending some info I obtained from the internet which may ,I hope ,help to sort out some of the queries you had about the information I had concerning Catherine Shields.\n\nI am fairly confident I have the correct person , but do not know who her parents were.\n\nThe chances are that the marriage and death certificate may show her parents to be Boyd, ( or Shields) but why is she known as Shields?!!!\n\nI am confused, Regards Bernie.\n\nCatherine Street (born Shields), 1823 - 1906 Catherine Street (born Shields) was born in 1823, at birth place, to Daniel Boyd and Catherine Boyd.\n\nCatherine married Charles Taloney Street on month day 1851, at age 28 at marriage place.\n\nCharles was born in 1816, in Weymouth, Dorset, England.\n\nHis occupation was Confectioner and Miner (Campbell's Creek, Victoria, Australia).\n\nThey had 9 children: Mary Jane Fitzpatrick (born Street), John Thomas Street and 7 other children.\n\nCatherine passed away of cause of death on month day 1906, at age 83 at death place.\n\nShe was buried at burial place.\n\nCharles Taloney Street, 1816 - 1871\n\nCharles Taloney Street was born in 1816, at birth place, to James Street and Mary Street.\n\nJames was born in 1785, in Weymouth, Dorset, England.\n\nMary was born in 1779.\n\nCharles had 4 siblings: Sara Street and 3 other siblings.\n\nCharles married Catherine Street (born Shields) on month day 1851, at age 35 at marriage place.\n\nCatherine was born in 1823, in Ahoghill, County Antrim, Ireland.\n\nThey had 9 children: Mary Jane Fitzpatrick (born Street), John Thomas Street and 7 other children.\n\nHis occupation was occupation.\n\nCharles passed away of cause of death on month day 1871, at age 55 at death place.\n\nHe was buried at burial place.\n\nJanet I hope this gets through to you alright, If Catherine was Born BOYD was she adopted or did she just change her name to Shields. Maybe she lived with a Shields Family.!!;\n\nRegards Bernie , Australia."
