        "text": "Mourne Mountains, County Down\n\nNorthern Ireland is home to the beautiful Mourne Mountains and Ring of Gullion, located in the Mourne Gullion Strangford Geopark, it offers a stunning range of Mountain peaks. The famous Slieve Donard is Northern Irelands highest mountain peak towering above the seaside town of Newcastle, County Down. There are 6 peaks over 700 metres high, with Donard the highest at 850m. The area is recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty and it is not hard to see why, with an immense amount of granite peaks squeezed into an area only 15 miles by 8 miles giving magnificent views.\n\nStretching 22 miles over the Mournes is the historical Mourne Wall, this interesting staple piece is made up of natural granite stone, standing 1.5m high and 0.8m thick. It was constructed by the Belfast Water Commissioners to prevent livestock from contaminating the reservoirs. The Mourne wall passes over fifteen of the mountain areas, you can't ever miss it!\n\nRivers, forests, lakes, and reservoirs make up some of the area and there are amazing scenic spots and viewpoints to visit scattered throughout the alluring Mourne Mountains.\n\nIn the last century, dams have been built to provide the main water supply to Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast. Silent Valley, located in the Mournes, is a great parkland for hikers and families with lots of walking trails which are easy to access. You will be treated to spectacular views. For a fun experience, when leaving Silent Valley turn right and take an excursion to Spegla Dam, park on the Electric Brae, otherwise known as the “Magic Hill”, let your parking brake off and experience the \"magic\" of your car rolling up hill, how strange!\n\nParts of the Mournes feature stunning forest areas, Tollymore Forest Park and Mourne Park, just to name a few. Tollymore Forest Park located in Newcastle County Down, is a stunning place at the foot of the Mournes with walking trails, rivers and spectacular views of the mountains. Mourne Park in Kilkeel, County Down, has one of the largest expanses of ancient woodland in Northern Ireland. It has riverside walks and iconic wildlife, such as otters, pine martens and red squirrels!\n\nTake a Hike!\n\nNo matter what the weather is, people flock from all over the world, this is a must visit destination for explorers who enjoy the outdoors. One of the most popular activities in our fascinating Mountains is hiking. There are a high variety of trails throughout the Mournes to choose from, ranging from easy walks to challenging hikes. On any weekend the forests are filled with energetic walkers, campers and eager daredevils doing some rock climbing.\n\nThere are various signature mountain walks other than Slieve Donard. Slieve Binnian, which sits at 747m high, is well known for its rocky peaks and for taking in exquisite sites including an abandoned quarrying village, and a viewpoint over the glassy Ben Crom Reservoir. Another popular hiking trek is Slieve Commedagh, known as the guarding or watching Mountain, it is the second highest peak at 767m, a challenging, strenuous hike for all you adventurers which showcases some fascinating historical features on the way.\n\nFor an easier stroll through the mountain area follow the Granite Trail, begin the walk adjacent to Newcastle harbour and follow the forest path taking you on the ascent to explore the quarry and finally follow the Glen River back to your finish destination in Donard Park.\n\nA trip to the Blue Lough is suitable for a family friendly walk. It begins at Carrick Little Car Park, this walk is an easy introduction to the Mountains of Mourne giving a mountain atmosphere whilst following gentle gradients and making use of distinct tracks and pathways. Stop of at the picturesque lake and find the perfect space for a picnic.\n\nTop Tips for Safety in the Mournes\n\nAlways check the weather forecast and prepare for changing conditions.\n\nPlan your route and let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return.\n\nBring enough food, water and do not forget to pack your map, compass and first aid kit.\n\nWear suitable clothing, appropriate footwear, and bring extra clothing incase of weather changes.\n\nStay on designated trails, avoid shortcuts, and off trail routes.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\nPack your fully charged mobile phone.\n\nIf part of a walking group always stay together and watch out for each other.\n\nIf you are lost or injured stay put, do not try to navigate yourself out, wait for help to arrive.\n\nFinally respect the environment and leave no trace, take all your rubbish home with you, and avoid disturbing wildlife and ecosystem.\n\nMOUNTAIN RESCUE – EMERGENCIES\n\nIf you find yourself in an emergency during your mountain journeys always contact The Mourne Mountains Rescue team, this group is a brilliant volunteer organisation that provides rescue emergency services in the Mournes, operating 7 days a week 365 days a year. The team is made up of highly skilled local mountaineers who undergo extensive training to provide the best rescue services during all weather conditions, offering their services through the Mourne Mountains, from Slieve Croob to the Cooley's in the south of Ireland. The team is funded entirely by donations and relies on the generosity of the public to provide funds to supply the equipment and training for the hard-working team. Overall, this great team is an essential part of the Mourne Mountains and Ring of Gullion area, their dedication to providing the best emergency rescue services in the Mountains shows their true commitment to the local area.\n\nMOURNE MOUNTAIN DRIVES\n\nIf you would like a scenic drive around the mountain area, there are driving routes such as the High Mournes Scenic Loop, Slieve Roosley Scenic Loop, Whitewater Scenic Loop and the Mourne Coastal Route.
