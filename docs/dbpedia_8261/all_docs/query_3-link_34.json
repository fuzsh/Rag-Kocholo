        "text": "The County Down village of Hillsborough has been granted royal status and will be known as Royal Hillsborough later this year.\n\nIt is the first village or town in Northern Ireland to be granted the title.\n\nHillsborough Castle is the residence of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family when visiting NI.\n\n\"Hillsborough has for a long time been a jewel in our local crown,\" said Lisburn mayor Nicholas Trimble.\n\nNI Secretary Brandon Lewis made the announcement on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"The village's royal status reflects the beauty of Hillsborough as well as its unique history and close connections to the Royal Family through their home in Hillsborough Castle,\" he said.\n\nTaking place during Northern Ireland's centenary year, the decision follows a recommendation from the UK Government in support of an application from Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.\n\nMayor of Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, councillor Nicholas Trimble, said it was an \"historic day for Hillsborough, for Northern Ireland and for the UK\".\n\n\"As a council, we are delighted that our application has been successful,\" he said.\n\n\"We are excited to support the continued development of Hillsborough as our number one project in the Belfast Region City Deal and the economic and tourism benefits this will bring to Northern Ireland.\"\n\nLaura McCorry, head of Hillsborough Castle and Gardens, said the news would provide a \"much-needed boost for tourism in Hillsborough, after a challenging year for the entire industry\".\n\n\"Hillsborough is a truly remarkable place, with so much to offer visitors - rich history, stunning surroundings and brilliant spots to eat, drink and shop,\" she said.\n\n\"Sitting at the heart of all of this is the castle we're privileged to care for, which has been the backdrop for many milestones in the history of Northern Ireland.\"\n\nHillsborough will officially become Royal Hillsborough after what is known as a Letters Patent is granted."
