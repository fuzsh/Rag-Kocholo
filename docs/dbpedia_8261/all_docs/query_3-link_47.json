        "text": "Warrenpoint is separated by a narrow strait of water from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nWarrenpoint can be seen from the shores of Carlingford Lough from Omeath in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nWarrenpoint was a coastal community that sprang up in the historic townland of Rinn Mhic Giolla Rua.\n\nRinn Mhic Giolla Rua is the Irish for Macilroy’s Point of which the townland of Ringmackilroy originates from.\n\nThe history books record the area of Warrenpoint with a number of names before the one it holds to the present day -Port Uí Néill (“O’Neill’s port”) or Port an Aoil “port of the lime”).\n\nIt was also known as Waring’s Point – see the History of Warrenpoint below.\n\nLocal folklore tells the tale that Warrenpoint was founded on a huge rabbit warren and thus how it got it’s name – incidentally the Town crest features the rabbit!\n\nWarrenpoint developed into a small port town with a huge windmill in the centre of the town dominating the skyline for miles around – see the History of Warrenpoint below.\n\nWarrenpoint is known locally as “The Point” or in Irish as “An Phointe” by it’s locals in and around South Down.\n\nThe name Warrenpoint originates from a family who lived in the area by the name Waring or Warren.\n\nThis information was recorded by Father Bernard Trainor who kept records of the people living in the area.\n\nLocal historians in the past have connected the origins of Warrenpoint and it’s name to General Warren who fought in the American War of Independence.\n\nThe Warren family may well have lived on a point at the sea and that’s how we got our name!\n\nAccording to local folklore, the area was a rabbit warren – the rabbit was featured on the Town crest and in more recent times on the crest of Warrenpoint Town Football Club (2022 saw the club adopt a new crest)- and thus how Warrenpoint got it’s name.\n\nWarrenpoint developed as a centre of local commerce for farming produce and trade via the local port.\n\nThe Windmill in Warrenpoint could be seen for miles around from land and sea – read more about the Windmill HERE\n\n“In or about February 1921, orders were issued to ambush a police patrol In the town of Warrenpoint. About twenty members of the Corrogs Company were mobilised for this operation and went into the town of Warrenpoint to carry it out.\n\nIt was customary for the police in Warrenpoint to go out each night on a patrol of the town. The movements of the patrol had been watched for some time previous to our going in to carry out the ambush. We found by careful observation that the police had no settled routine route for their patrol. They changed their routes through the town almost each night. This fact forced us on the night planned for the operation to post men at various points to ensure that no matter what particular streets they traversed some of us would have an opportunity at some point to engage them.\n\nOne particular fact we knew from observation was that every night they traversed a street known as Summerhill which had three cross streets leading off. Parties of our men were placed at two of these intersections in such position as to ensure that the police would come under fire if they traversed Summerhill area.\n\nI was not myself a member of either ambushing parties on this night. My orders were to scout and to ensure that the ambushers would get timely warning of the approach of the police. As far as I can remember a patrol of five men came along into the Summerhill area and were attacked by bomb and revolver fire. Some of the attackers had rifles. I cannot say at the moment if the rifles were used or not.\n\nIn the exchange of fire the police suffered the following casualties: One policeman killed, two wounded, one of whom subsequently died. Intensive police activities followed this ambush in Corrogs area. All the houses were raided by police, Special Constabulary and Auxiliaries.\n\nOn the morning after the ambush I was taking a horse and cart up the road to a neighbouring house when I met two lorryloads of Specials. On one of the lorries I recognised an R.I.C. man named Constable Michael Enright. Much to my surprise I found that the lorries passed me without interfering with me and proceeded to my father’s house. There they found a picture of Terence MacSwiney which they destroyed.\n\nThey then arrested my father and took him into Newry, a prisoner. I found out quite recently from a friend who met this ex-Constable Enright in Newry about a year ago that Enright told him that he recognised me that morning and that if he had identified me his comrades would have shot me. My father, after his release from Newry, told me that this same Constable Enright had saved his life after his arrest when other policemen wanted to shoot him. Enright resigned from the Police Force shortly after these incidents.”\n\nIn April 1976, loyalist paramilitaries attacked the Ulster Bar, The Square, Warrenpoint throwing a bomb into the pub.\n\nThe explosion killed local man Matthew Campbell who died as a result of his injuries.\n\nIn June 1976, Warrenpoint teacher Liam Prince was mistakenly shot dead by the British Army close to the border.\n\nIn 1981, Ivan Toombs, customs officer and Major in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was shot dead by IRA gunmen in the Custom and Excise offices where he worked based in Warrenpoint Docks.\n\nIn 1983, The Crown Hotel which was situated on The Square in Warrenpoint was blown up and destroyed by the IRA.\n\nThe Seven Steps Hotel along the front shore was also firebombed and destroyed..\n\nIn February 1983, RUC reserve constable Edward Magill was shot dead by the IRA while on duty in Warrenpoint Town centre while walking to the shop.\n\nIn April 1989, an IRA bomb planted in Heatley and Morgan’s building supplies yard adjacent to the police station exploded killing local Warrenpoint girl, Joanne Reilly.\n\nThe police station was the intended target of the bomb attack.\n\nJoanne was 20 years old.\n\nThe blast also injured 30 people and caused extensive damage properties in the area.\n\nFurther reading on the Troubles HERE\n\nPopulation of Warrenpoint\n\nThe 2021 census of Newry, Mourne and Down recorded a population of 182,074 with 68,397 households.\n\nThe nationality or nationalities that the person identifies with was as follows:\n\nBritish only 17%\n\nIrish only 47%\n\nNorthern Irish only 21%\n\nBritish & Irish only <1%\n\nBritish & Northern Irish only 4%\n\nIrish & Northern Irish only 3%\n\nBritish, Irish & Northern Irish only 1%\n\nOther national identities 6%\n\n2011 Census Warrenpoint and Burren\n\nThe UK census of 2011 listed a population in Warrenpoint and Burren of 8732 people.\n\nThe breakdown of the local Warrenpoint population by gender according to the 2011 census was 48.9% Female and 51.1 male.\n\nThe 2011 census recorded the religious breakdown of the population of Warrenpoint and Burren as follows:\n\nCatholic 87.7%\n\nProtestant 9.6%\n\nOther 0.2%\n\nNone 2.5%\n\nThe total amount of people born outside the UK and Ireland was 548.\n\nThe amount of lone person households in the Warrenpoint and Burren area was 3300.\n\nThe percentage of the Warrenpoint and Burren population that have no car or van per household was 20.6%"
