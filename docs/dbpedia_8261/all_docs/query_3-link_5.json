        "text": "Take a small step south from Belfast, and you’ll find yourself in one of the most popular destinations in Northern Ireland - County Down. Stretching from the shores of Belfast Lough, out around Strangford Lough, and down into the magnificent Mourne Mountains. You’ll find yourself at home beside castles, beaches, forest parks, stately homes, a Royal Palace and the world's top links golf course.\n\nCounty Down has every landscape you’re looking for\n\nThis place really packs it all in. You could try and do it all in one go, but where’s the pleasure in that? Here’s a few ideas to get you started.\n\nMake for the Mourne Mountains\n\nThe Mourne Mountains dominate the south of County Down. There are walking routes up each of the mountains and you don’t have to climb the highest peaks to experience their majestic beauty. Breathe in the fresh air as you take in spectacular scenery including forest parks and coastal views.\n\nIn the foothills you’ll find forests. Take a walk along the Shimna River at Tollymore Forest Park and view many curiosities along the way including rocky outcrops, bridges, grottos and caves. Tree lovers can examine exotic trees such as monkey puzzle and eucalyptus or admire the tall giant redwoods and Monterey pines here.\n\nAt Castlewellan Forest Park, explore one of the most outstanding tree and shrub collections in Europe, located in a dramatic setting of mountains and sea. Dander through the garden and see informal and formal design with terraces, fountains, ornamental gates and flower borders dotted throughout. Get lost in the ‘Peace Maze’, one of the world's largest permanent hedge mazes where visitors can attempt to solve their way to the bell in the centre.\n\nCastles and Sandcastles\n\nCounty Down offers plenty of castle adventures, some big and some small. The biggest and best known - thanks to Game of Thrones® - is Castle Ward which is famous for its views over the tranquil waters of Strangford Lough. Strike out along the Lough Trail and spot a host of wildlife and rare plants. Walk or cycle the trails on-site, roam the house, enjoy some refreshments in the tea rooms or immerse yourself in Game of Thrones® Territory by visiting some of the locations which featured in the most famous scenes from the hit show.\n\nScrabo Tower in Newtownards is another towering masterpiece. This monument stands proud on a steep hill 540 feet above sea level and 125 feet high and is visible even from Belfast on a good day. It gives incredible views over Strangford Lough, and inland across rolling hills and forests.\n\nIf it’s sandcastles you’re after, then there are beaches galore here. The most popular of them all is at Newcastle, where the golden sand stretches for the best part of a mile. The town itself curves right around the strand and you’ll find plenty of seaside cafes, bars and eateries to replenish the energy levels.\n\nWalk into nature\n\nFor an easy coastal walk, with wildlife-spotting thrown in, head to the beach at Murlough Nature Reserve in Dundrum where you will find five miles of golden sands to stroll along. You can get even closer to the wildlife, without getting wet, at Exploris Aquarium & Seal Sanctuary in Portaferry. Be amazed by a diver’s view of marine life from around the world, from the native species in Strangford Lough to the colourful coral reefs of the Tropical Oceans.\n\nTime to unwind and dine\n\nAfter a short break jam-packed full of outdoor exercise, it’s time to unwind in the Soak Seaweed Baths located on the South Promenade in Newcastle. It’s the ideal place to experience an activity which has enriched the lives of people on this island for more than a century. Lie down in your Victorian roll top bath in a private bathroom and soak in hot seawater and fresh seaweed.\n\nAfter that, it’s time to dine. Taste the freshest, locally caught seafood at the Mourne Seafood Bar, 10 minutes from the Slieve Donard Resort & Spa, or choose one of the restaurants and bars in the Slieve Donard itself.\n\nIf you’re up around Strangford Lough, the Coq & Bull in Bangor is a destination restaurant with a difference, while Balloo House in Killinchy is a beautiful country pub and restaurant that combines history, tradition and comfort with a passion for excellence in food. In Strangford village itself you can choose from The Cuan, The Lobster Pot or the Artisan Cook House all using the best of local produce, with seafood at the top of their menus.\n\nA beautiful base for the Mourne Mountains\n\nIf you’re going to spend any length of time here, and you should spend as much as you can, then you’re going to need a base. Like everything else here, there’s plenty of choice when it comes to hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs, camping, glamping and caravanning.\n\nThe biggest hotel in the county is also amongst the very best. The Slieve Donard Resort and Spa (4*) in Newcastle is tucked between the world-famous Royal County Down championship golf course and Newcastle Strand.\n\nThe hotel stands on six acres of private grounds and is known for providing top hospitality for over 100 years. Treat your eyes to stunning panoramic views across the Irish Sea and the Royal County Down Golf Club, host to the 2015 Irish Open.\n\nSlow down and enjoy the tranquil waters of Strangford Lough\n\nIn the Strangford Lough area, immerse yourself in rural and watery bliss with stunning views and places to visit a little off the beaten track. Only a 30 minute drive from Belfast, the beautiful shores of Strangford Lough are there to be explored. Drive the coastal road along the penisula and enjoy little hidden gems along the way. Look out for Kearney Village, a National Trust owned village, Nugent's Wood which is perfect for walks and of course Exploris Aquarium, Mount Stewart and Scrabo Tower.\n\nBeautiful Bangor for a traditional day beside the seaside\n\nIf you do like to be beside the seaside then Bangor is the place to go. Perfect for a traditional seaside day out with the beautiful marina and Pickie Fun Park for the little (and big!) ones. Enjoy an ice-cream and a stroll along Eisenhower pier. Or a walk along the North Down Coastal Path, all the way to Holywood - perfect on a sunny day.\n\nStay and explore\n\nStrangford Lough has a long maritime history that’s worth exploring, so before you get paddling, kick back and relax in the picturesque The Port (3*) which overlooks the Lough. Enjoy dinner whilst watching the Strangford Ferry negotiate the strong currents! After dinner, head to Fiddler’s Green to have a few drinks and check out the Game of Thrones® door.\n\nNestled in the centre of the quaint conservation village of Strangford is The Cuan (4*), the perfect place to unwind and base to explore. Get a second stamp of your Game of Thrones® passport as there is an iconic door located here too – go one step further and book in for a Game of Thrones® themed Banquet.\n\nBangor is another good base for exploring Strangford Lough and in the town you’ll find the Clandeboye Lodge (4*). You’ll love this rural hideaway’s contemporary décor, award-winning Coq & Bull Brasserie and its manicured grounds. After a day out and about on the Lough and elsewhere it’s quite the haven for tired minds and bodies.\n\nHard to believe that all this is just south of Belfast, and little more than an hour or two from Dublin. When you get here and discover just what’s waiting for you, you’ll find it even harder to believe!\n\nCheck ahead with providers before visiting and book in advance where possible."
