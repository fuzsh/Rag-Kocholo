Between 1750 and the mid-1840s, very tiny farms spread in hilly areas of the county, as poor people created holdings out of what had previously been waste land. The aim here was to secure a living for their families, and up to the Great Famine of the 1840s they were very successful in this, using the wonder crop of the age, the potato. In lowland areas, small farms spread with the development of the linen industry. Until the early nineteenth century, most linen was produced by farming families, who processed their flax crop, spun the linen thread, and wove it at home. This system of linen production was very labour intensive, well suited to small farms and big families. In the early nineteenth century, linen production moved into factories and many of the small farms were no longer viable. However, even after more than one hundred years, the impact of the linen industry meant that the average size of farms in County Down in 1957 was thirty to fifty acres.1 By contrast, elsewhere in Ireland most landlords resisted subdivision on good land, allowing it on marginal areas, which were largely cleared by the Famine and its aftermath.\n\nWithin this overall pattern of small mixed farms, there was a lot of variety in farming within County Down. By the early twentieth century, for example, the area around Belfast had farms specialising in dairying, while the northern part of the Ards peninsula, with its relatively dry climate, was known for vegetable production. The Ards and the coastal areas of Mourne, with their sandy soils and plentiful supplies of seaweed for fertiliser, had become centres of excellence for potato cultivation.2 By contrast, the hill farms of the Mourne Mountains in the south of the county were known for sheep farming.3\n\nFrom the eighteenth century onwards, Irish farming methods were recorded in increasing detail, and some of the best early evidence comes from County Down. For example, our clearest surviving illustration of an Old Irish Long-beamed plough, one of the ‘common’ ploughs of the period, comes from near Hillsborough (Fig1). However, the county was also in the forefront of improved farming. For example, a Mr Christy of Kirkassock near Magheralin, claimed to be the first farmer to have installed a threshing machine in Ireland, in 1796,4 and County Down farmers were involved in early experiments in the development of horse-drawn reaping machines. A machine demonstrated to a number of gentlemen in 1806 at a specially arranged event in Moira, for example, was one of the earliest such events in Ireland.5 The small commercial farms that were common throughout the county adopted a lot of the new foundryproduced equipment from the early nineteenth century onwards. These standardised, mass-produced implements are the main evidence of horse-powered farm machinery within County Down.\n\nJonathan Bell and Mervyn Watson\n\nFig 2 A Ferguson tractor reaping grain in 1938. (Courtesy of the Museum of Rural Life, Reading).\n\nIn the twentieth century, a County Down man, Harry Ferguson, was responsible for Ireland’s most celebrated contribution to the development of farm machinery, the Ferguson tractor with its three point linkage and hydraulic lift (Fig 2). The Ferguson system allowed farmers to control implements attached to the back of the tractor, raising or lowering them, or moving them sideways as they drove. This transformed the tractor from an unwieldy ‘iron horse’ into the main source of power in crop production. Tractors incorporating the system were manufactured in 1936, and by the 1950s, the ‘Wee Grey Fergie’ was world famous.\n\nCrops\n\nDuring the last three hundred years, the main crops grown in County Down were potatoes, oats and hay. Oats have been grown here for thousands of years, while potatoes became the staple crop for most Irish people during the seventeenth century. A reference to potato growing near Comber in 1606 may not be substantiated but by the 1680s, potatoes were said to have become ‘the chief article of food’ of the ‘common’ people all over the country.6 Hay was not widely grown in Ireland before the eighteenth century, but after the Famine of the 1840s, there was a long-term swing away from crops to livestock, and by 1900 hay was the biggest crop after pasture.7\n\nMost farm crops in Ireland are cultivated annually, and the first task is to till or turn the ground. This was done with spades and ploughs. Irish farmers are said to be the best spadesmen in the world. By the early nineteenth century, hundreds of different types of spades were used, often to make cultivation ridges, the dimensions of which could be varied to suit the soil, slope, aspect, crop grown, and season of planting.8 In Ulster most of these spades were made in spade mills. The main mills in County Down were in Newtown townland in the parish of Kilbroney, or nearby in the parish of Newry, in the townlands\n\nFig 3 An advertisement for Carvill of Newry, published in The Irish Farmers Gazette in 1850.\n\nFig 4 Scottish swing plough. of Finnard, Damolly, and Newry town. The Newry firm of Carvill was the first to manufacture an ‘improved’ type of spade that was quickly adopted throughout the east of Ireland (Fig 3).9\n\nFrom the mid-1700s farming publications were full of discussions about the potential of improved implements and methods. County Down farmers were very quick to adopt these new developments, once their usefulness and reliability were demonstrated. In the early nineteenth century, for example, most farmers in the county began to use Scottish ‘swing’ ploughs (Fig 4).\n\nLike the Old Irish ploughs these had no wheels, but unlike the older ploughs, they were made of metal and were designed so that they could be pulled by two horses, and turn sods so that these lay in even furrow slices. These ploughs remained popular, especially in hillier areas, until well into the twentieth century. It was only after land had been well-drained and levelled that farmers began to use English style wheel or ‘chill’ ploughs, which can still be seen in use at several annual ploughing matches within the county (Fig 5).\n\nOne of the main achievements of the early period of experimentation and debate, was the development of drill cultivation of crops. The idea behind making drills is simple. Drills are long, straight equidistant rows,\n\nFig 5 A wheel plough in use on Edward Rea’s farm at Annacloy, in the 1940s -1950s. The ploughman is Mr Daniel Marner, and the plough is now in the collection of Down County Museum. (plough DCM 1984-8; photo DCM 05/35/09)\n\nand crops grown in them can be sown, cared for, and harvested more methodically than crops sown broadcast. The great champion of drill cultivation in England was Jethro Tull, who developed a machine for sowing grain crops in drills in the early eighteenth century. In Ireland, implements for making drills were being manufactured as early as the 1760s, but the drill cultivation of grain was mostly found on larger farms. However, by the 1830s, farmers in most parts of the country were growing potatoes in ‘raised’ drills. These were made in soil that had already been ploughed, and loosened by harrowing. Special ‘drill ploughs’ were then used to push the soil into low triangular ridges. Potatoes were planted in the furrows between these, and the drill plough was then drawn up through the middle of each ridge, to push the soil over the seed. The earliest illustration of a drill plough that we know of in Ireland was published in a book about County Down, in 1802 (Fig 6).10\n\nFarmers in the Mourne area also developed their own ingenious modification of older wooden ploughs, so that they could be used to make drills. A block of wood, known as a ‘false reest’ was attached to the flat ‘land’ side of the plough. This created a two-sided plough that could be used to push soil into drills. These dualpurpose ploughs were used in the Mournes well into the twentieth century (Fig 7). Later Mourne ploughs were used only to make drills, but their early history as ploughs\n\nFig 6 Wooden drill plough, illustrated in Dubordieu, John A Statistical Survey of County Down (Dublin, 1802), p52.\n\nFig 7 Hugh Chambers of Moneydarragh, demonstrating the use of a Mourne plough in the 1970s. (copyright Jonathan Bell and Mervyn Watson).\n\nused for turning furrows could still be seen in their asymmetrical construction.\n\nGrowing potatoes and other root crops in drills meant that weeding of growing crops could be mechanised. Because the crops were spaced equally apart, it was possible for horse-drawn weeding implements to be pulled along the rows. Grubbers are fitted with iron feet, and these pulled out weeds growing between the rows, without damaging the growing potatoes. A drill plough could then be pulled between the drills, pushing earth up over the potato plants, to give more soil for the development of tubers. Horsedrawn machines for harvesting potatoes could also be used when the crop was grown in drills. These implements had a blade that cut under the potatoes, and spinning metal forks, or feet, which knocked the tubers out of the ground. One of the earliest effective potato digging machines was patented by a County Antrim man in 1855.11\n\nBy the mid nineteenth century, the harvesting of grain was becoming mechanised successfully. In1852 American reaping machines were shown at the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show in Belfast, and farmers quickly became aware of the potential of the new machines. In 1858, trials at Clandeboye in North Down led some ‘gentlemen’ farmers present to claim that the reapermower manufactured by the English firm of Burgess and Key performed best at harvesting both oats and hay.12 The history of Irish farming is notable for the extent to which very old techniques can co-exist with modern ones. For example, on at least one large farm in County Down, Maxwell’s at Finnebrogue, oxen were used as draught animals until well into the twentieth century.13 More often, however, the use of older techniques was associated with small scale farming. For example, while commercial farmers were buying horse drawn reaping machines, many small hill farmers were still using sickles to harvest their grain. This was not because they were in some way irrationally conservative, but because they understood which farming methods suited their scale of crop production, and available labour. Using a sickle is very labour intensive. The reaper using a sickle holds each handful of grain stalks as he, or she, cuts through them. Sickle blades have serrated edges, and the grain is cut with a sawing motion. This method of harvesting has big advantages. Because each handful of grain is cut individually, grain that has been flattened by wind or rain can be lifted up and cut. Also, the reaper selects which stalks to cut, so that weeds growing among the crop can be left behind. Finally, because each handful is held, the grain heads are not badly shaken while being harvested and seed is not lost by shaking. This was a particularly important advantage in the mild, damp Irish climate, where grain took longer to ripen, and seed was more likely to be loosened in the grain heads.\n\nThe skill with which Irish harvesters could reap with sickles meant that harvest workers, who travelled to Britain for seasonal work, were in big demand, so much so that they slowed up the introduction of the scythe to parts of Britain.14 The late Joey Murphy, whose family had a farm in the Glen, near Hilltown, recorded an account of a scythe being demonstrated in the Mournes by a returning migrant worker in the later nineteenth century. Using a scythe to cut grain was a novelty, and a lot of local people came to watch the demonstration (Fig 8).15\n\nFig 8 Mowing grain with a scythe. This is a rare illustration of a simple ‘cradle’ fixed to the back of the scythe, to catch the harvested grain neatly as it fell. The scythesman was probably Barney Sloane, and the photograph was taken by Pat Hudson at Lisnaree in Glenloughan. (DCM H05/67/01) Fig 9 Mowing rye grass. Grass grown for hay should be cut before the seed ripens, but in the early twentieth century, the cultivation of grass for seed became important in Ulster. County Down produced half of the rye grass seed grown commercially. (DCM DJ05/43/03/07)\n\nScythes, probably introduced by the Anglo-Normans in the twelfth century, were also used for mowing grass to make hay. By 1900, hay was the biggest crop in Ireland, but by this time the introduction of horse drawn reaping machines was well under way. The production of grass seed was well established in the early twentieth century. By the 1960s, County Down produced half the rye grass seed grown in Ulster.16 (Fig 9)\n\nFig.10 William Lyons of Gannoway with two of his daughters, Dolly and Isabel, in 1933.

As in the rest of Ireland, horses in County Down were often used for a range of tasks - tillage, driving and riding. This meant that they tended to be smaller than horses used only for farm work. In the eighteenth century, most farmers used ‘garrans’, small, sturdy working horses (Fig 1). In the next hundred years, selective breeding led to the spread of larger working horses, but these still tended to be smaller than English or continental breeds. They were also mostly ‘clean boned’, with slender legs and small feet (Fig 10). Most farmers preferred these qualities, because the horses could work more neatly, for instance when ploughing; their small feet meant that they could step neatly along the line of a furrow. Some North Down farmers used heavier Clydesdale horses, for extra pulling power. Clydesdale breeders in the county developed a good reputation, especially in the 1980s and subsequently, when the quality of Clydesdales bred in Ulster rivaled that of Scotland, where the breed originated.\n\nTractors began to displace horses on County Down farms during the Second World War (1939 – 1945), and by 1960 working horses were becoming uncommon.\n\nCounty Down 1939 1959 Horses 27,159 2,300 Tractors 140 7,75017\n\nApart from horses, numbers of livestock in County Down have grown almost continuously since the mid-nineteenth century. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, cattle in the county were kept for both meat and milk. This was particularly the case on small hill farms in the south of the county. Several attempts were made by breeders in nineteenth century\n\nIreland to develop a useful ’dual-purpose’ breed of cattle for small farms on marginal land. Some landlords took an interest in promoting specific breeds. In the late nineteenth century, for example, The Countess of Clanwilliam kept a herd of Kerry cattle on the Montalto estate in Ballynahinch.18 In Ulster generally, some breeders worked at the establishment of the Irish Moiled cattle breed. These cattle shared characteristics, such as colouring, with animals described in ancient literature, but the breed society was not established successfully until 1926. ‘Moilie’ cattle flourished on a small scale during the 1930s, but then went into a slow decline. By 1982, one of only two herds in the world survived on the farm of Mr Jimmy Nelson outside Killyleagh. This herd was used to re-establish the cattle as a highly valued rare breed (Fig 11).\n\nIn North Down, the demands of Belfast for dairy produce led to the development of specialised dairy farming, and by 1900 the main breed here, as elsewhere in Northern Europe, was the Dairy Shorthorn (Fig12). Throughout the county as a whole Shorthorns and Aberdeen Angus were the most common breeds.19\n\nPigs were kept on most small County Down farms. By the early nineteenth century, Ulster farmers had crossed\n\nFig 11 Irish Moiled Cattle at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra, County Down. (Copyright Jonathan Bell and Mervyn Watson).

It was claimed that ‘for early maturity and economy of production, high class flavour and quality of bacon’ the Large White Ulster was unsurpassed.21 The Large White Ulster was also thinskinned, however, which meant that live pigs could be easily bruised while being moved. This meant that until the mid twentieth century, pigs in Ulster tended to be slaughtered on the farm (Fig 14). Large White Ulster\n\nFig 14 Slaughtered pigs with their innards removed, photographed by Tommy Gribben. (DCM G05/87/14/241)\n\npigs declined in numbers during the 1930s, as tastes changed to leaner meat, and the establishment of pork curing plants set up as part of the Pig Marketing Scheme in 1933 led to pigs being taken away from farms for slaughtering. By the 1960s, the breed was extinct.22\n\nSheep, like other livestock, increased greatly in numbers in the lowlands of County Down from the mid nineteenth century (Fig 15). However, the most distinctive type of sheep in the county were found in the Mountains of Mourne (Fig16). Mourne sheep were recognised as distinctive as early as 1802, when they were described as ‘very finely made in all points, finely woolled and much prized for … mutton’.23 Critics have claimed that Mourne sheep are inferior versions of Scottish Blackface sheep, but farmers in Mourne have continued to argue that they are superior, in size, hardiness and quality, and attempts are under way to get formal recognition for them.24\n\nFairs, Markets and Marts\n\nMarkets and fairs were the main means of trade for many rural people until well into the twentieth century. Markets depended on a regular (usually weekly) flow of trade, whereas fairs were seasonal or monthly, and more specialised. However, there was a large overlap in the activities carried on at both types of event.\n\nMarkets were held in many County Down towns. Downpatrick market, for example, was held every Saturday, and in the 1830s and 1840s it was described as well supplied with provisions of all kinds.25 By this time also, several ports in the county were exporting agricultural produce. From the Downpatrick area, wheat, barley, oats cattle, pigs and potatoes were exported from the Quoile quay, and from Newcastle, oats, barley and potatoes, ‘of which large quantities are sent to Dublin and Liverpool.’26 Fairs (Irish: aonaighe) were an important part of early Irish society, often associated with a saint’s pattern, or other important ritual occasion. The Anglo-Normans established fairs primarily as commercial events, and patents to hold fairs were granted as part of this development. By the seventeenth century, towns such as Ballynahinch had regular fairs; by the 1830s, fairs were held in the town on the first Thursday of every month apart from June, September, and December.27 By the later eighteenth century, many County Down towns had fairs associated with the sale of brown linens (Fig17). The situation in Banbridge in the 1830s shows how well-developed the organisation of fairs and markets could be by this time.\n\nThe town … has risen … to an eminent degree of commercial importance as the head of the principal district of linen manufacture … The market house [is] situated in the centre of the town … a large and handsome edifice surmounted by a dome and built by the Marquee of Downshire in 1834, at an expense of £2,000. A brown linen hall was also erected by him in 1817, and a market-place for meal and grain in 1817, and held on the first Monday in every month; and fairs for horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and manufactured goods, are held on Jan.12th, first Saturday in March, June 9th, August 26th, and November 16th; the last is a very noted fair for horses.28\n\nFairs remained an important part of the economic life of Banbridge and other towns such as Rathfriland, Downpatrick and Saintfield well into the 1950s (Fig 18).\n\nHiring fairs, for the recruitment of farm servants, were well established by the late nineteenth century. At least ten towns in County Down had hiring fairs.29 They were usually held twice a year, in May and November. Servants looking for work would gather at a central place in the town, where they would bargain with prospective employers, mostly local farmers. The servant would usually live on the farm for six months, receiving bed and board, and a small monetary payment at the end of the term.\n\nFairs in general were organised to meet the changing needs of regions within the county. For example, in 1837, the main fairs in Hilltown were for linen yarn and cattle.30 At this time, the nearby uplands of the Mourne mountains were used as summer pastures for cattle. Later in the century, however, sheep numbers began to increase very rapidly, and by the 1880s, sheep rather than cattle were kept on the mountains. In the twentieth century, the Mournes were nearly all common grazing for sheep.31 The fairs in Hilltown reflected this development, and the best known fairs, held in August, September and October, were for the sale of sheep (Fig.19). At the ‘Tup Fair’ in September, as late as the 1970s, a ram was brought on to stage at a dance organised on the evening\n\nFig 18 The horse fair at Banbridge, photographed by Pat Hudson in 1944.

The festive aspect of the event became its core when the event was re-organised as the ‘Boley Fair’ in 1986. In the 1950s, the biggest monthly fairs in County Down were held in Ballynahinch, Rathfriland and Crossgar.32 However, by this time, fairs began to be replaced by marts and auctions: formal auctions were held regularly in a purpose built yard and sales ring. These are now the main local centres for livestock trade throughout the county (Fig 20).\n\nRecent History\n\nThe thirty years following the Second World War was a time of relative security for County Down farmers. The war had entrenched the notion that government had a direct role to play in guaranteeing agricultural markets, so farmers could be assured of minimum prices for their produce. Numbers of livestock (cattle, pigs and poultry) in the county have increased steadily since the war. Crop production declined, but investment in modern machinery continued. For example, by 1960 there were 200 combine harvesters in the county, half the total number in Northern Ireland.33 The number of farmers declined, but farm size increased, from around 50 acres in the 1950s, to 90.64 acres (36.7 hectares) in 2007.34\n\nThe security of County Down farmers came under threat during the 1980s, when the European Union began the slow, painful task of dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy. By the end of the 1990s, farming had become much more risky, and many farms were no longer operated on a full-time basis. However, in the first ten years of the new millennium, things have changed again. The development of bio-fuels, and increased demands for grain have meant that prices have risen, and for the first time in decades the acreages of crops has increased. It remains to be seen if this heralds a new era of prosperity for County Down farmers.\n\nFig 20 The cattle mart at Downpatrick, photographed by D J McNeill.
