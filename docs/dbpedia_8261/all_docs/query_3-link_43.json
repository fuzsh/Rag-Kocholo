        "text": "One of the most popular destinations in Northern Ireland is a visit to County Down. Home to castles, beaches, forests and stately homes, the county has lots of fantastic places to visit and explore. County Down is perhaps most well known for Mourne Mountains, which is the highest mountain range in Northern Ireland.\n\nSeasoned hikers can climb the highest peak to admire the dramatic beauty of the Mournes. Whilst those looking for something less strenuous can enjoy several shorter walks along the foothills.\n\nGame of Thrones fans will no doubt want to pay a visit to Castle Ward, which is where they filmed scenes from Winterfell Castle. Visitors can expect medieval walls, castle gates and beautiful surrounding landscapes. There is a guided tour around Castle Ward, which covers over 20 key game of Thrones filming locations.\n\nFor those who love to be by the sea, head over to Murlough Beach and take a walk along the sandy shore. Murlough Beach is a finely kept beach and has striking views of the ocean and surrounding Mourne Mountains.\n\nSituated at the bottom of Mourne Mountains is Tollymore Forest Park, an impressive forest covering 630 hectares of land. The area is perfect for those looking for picturesque walks, horse riding, camping, and orienteering. There is also a nature play area for little children.\n\nIf you are a keen golfer, you may want to spend a day at The Royal County Down Golf Club. It is one of the worldâ€™s most beautiful link courses and is situated in Murlough Nature Reserve against the magnificent backdrop of the Mountains of Mourne."
