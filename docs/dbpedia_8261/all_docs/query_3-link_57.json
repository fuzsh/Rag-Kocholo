        "text": "The Mourne Mountains are a granite mountain range in County Down in the south-east of Northern Ireland. It includes the highest mountains in Northern Ireland and the province of Ulster. The highest of these is Slieve Donard at 850 metres (2,790 ft). The Mournes is an area of outstanding natural beauty and has been proposed as the first national park in Northern Ireland. The area is partly owned by the National Trust and see a large number of visitors every year. The name Mourne is derived from the name of a Gaelic clann or sept called the MÃºghdhorna.\n\nThe Mourne Wall is among the more famous features in the Mournes. It is a 35 kilometres (22 mi) dry-stone wall that crosses fifteen summits, constructed to define the boundaries of the 36 square kilometres (8,900 acres) area of land purchased by the Belfast Water Commissioners in the late 1800s. This followed a number of Acts of Parliament allowing the sale, and the establishment of a water supply from the Mournes to the growing industrial city of Belfast. Construction of the Mourne Wall was started in 1904 and was completed in 1922.\n\nThe mountains are immortalised in a song written by Percy French in 1896, \"The Mountains of Mourne\". The song has been recorded by many artistes, including Don McLean. it is believed that The Mourne Mountains also influenced C.S. Lewis to write The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nThe Mourne Mountains, The Mountains of Mourne, The Mourne Wall, Slieve Donard, The Chronicles of Narnia."
