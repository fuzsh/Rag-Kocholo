In addition to his orchestral and solo activities, Mr. Shields is increasingly becoming known to North American audiences as a dynamic and passionate performer of chamber music, making over 30 appearances annually in intimate settings throughout the United States and Canada. James is the co-artistic director of Chatter, an Albuquerque-based chamber music organization that presents over 125 concerts per year. In over a decade of involvement with Chatter, Mr. Shields has programmed and performed in hundreds of concerts, and presented a diverse range of repertoire, from classical favorites to world premieres. In Portland, he is a member of cutting-edge chamber music groups Fear No Music and 45th Parallel Universe, as well as a frequent guest performer with Third Angle New Music. In addition to his performing activities, James holds an M.M. in composition from the University of New Mexico and continues to compose regularly.\n\nSee James perform during our concert season!"
