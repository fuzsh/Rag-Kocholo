        "text": "The Scots came to America direct from Scotland. They differ from the others in that they did not spend any time in Ulster. They came to America from different departure points, often in different migrant waves, and settled in different areas of colonial America. For example, many Scots settled in the Chesapeake area of Virginia, whilst the Scots-Irish generally helped to open up the western frontier in places like Pennsylvania, along the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, and the Carolinas.\n\nScots-Irish, Scotch-Irish and Ulster-Scots – basically, these are variant names for the same people. All three terms relate to people who left Scotland, many in the seventeenth century; settled as part of various, successive waves of plantation in Ulster – the northernmost province of Ireland; stayed maybe one, two or several generations; and then moved on to North America.\n\nFrom the first decades of the eighteenth century, the Scots-Irish started to emigrate to the Americas in ever increasing numbers. The migrant flow became stronger as settlers from Ulster took advantage of the opportunities in the burgeoning colonies. Having moved once already and broken the link with their ancestral home in Scotland, it was quite practical to move again to where a better future beckoned.\n\nAlthough the terms, historically, have been used interchangeably in the Americas, more commonly these immigrants are referred to as Scots-Irish and Scotch-Irish in North America. Despite the assertion that Scotch applies only to whisky (see panel far right) and not to the people of Scotland, many Scotch-Irish in America are fiercely proud of this title and defend its use unfailingly, citing evidence from the period to substantiate their claim. The term Ulster-Scots, although also used in colonial America, is more commonly applied in the British Isles to refer to the people who moved from Scotland to Ulster, many of whom then, some time later, moved again to America.\n\nFor more information about Ulster-Scots history and culture, go to:\n\nwww.ulsterscotsagency.com\n\nYou could be doubly blessed – having Scottish and Scots-Irish roots!\n\nThe large numbers of Ulster-Scots people moving from Ulster to the New World in the colonial period lends weight to the viewpoint that people of ‘Scottish’ ancestry, in many instances, will have a strongly Irish, or more specifically Ulster, dimension to their ancestry. Thus it may be the case that for many Americans today, their ancestral line is not so much purely Scottish as Ulster-Scots. And what a bonus that could be for the avid genealogist!\n\nAlthough migration directly from Scotland to America continued through the period, given the scale of Ulster migration to America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the keen genealogist should perhaps look to Ulster for their emigrant ancestors, and from there back to Scotland.\n\nTracing Ulster ancestors is great fun – it can be one of the most rewarding pastimes for any family historian. And after the hard work researching comes the enjoyment: exploring Ulster itself – the people, the scenery, the history. In visiting Northern Ireland, researchers are guaranteed one of life’s rich experiences. All this and still Scotland to discover as well.\n\nFor further information about visiting Northern Ireland, go to:\n\nwww.discovernorthernireland.com\n\nFor further information about tracing Irish or Scots-Irish roots, go to:\n\nwww.ancestryireland.com\n\nDuring the 1650s the remaining Gaelic landownership in Ulster was almost wiped out. Large swathes of land were confiscated from the Irish gentry as a punishment for their rebellion and granted to British settlers. For a time Scottish landowners in Ulster were also in a difficult situation, with the threat of confiscation also hanging over them for their support of the royalist cause. Eventually, however, their possessions were secured on payment of heavy fines. Cromwell died in 1658 and in 1660 the monarchy was restored. The new king, Charles II, was faced with the difficulty of having to find land for those Catholics who had remained loyal to the Crown during the previous twenty years. Several Scottish Catholics, the Marquess of Antrim and the Hamiltons in Strabane barony, County Tyrone, were restored to the estates they had held prior to 1641. Apart from this there were relatively few changes to the land settlement laid down by Cromwell.\n\nMigration to the north of Ireland in the 1650s was encouraged by low rents in the aftermath of a decade of warfare. In the 1670s migration was encouraged by the Covenanter disturbances in Scotland. These fresh migrations were having a noticeable impact on local demographics. About 1670 Oliver Plunkett, Catholic archbishop of Armagh, noted that the city of Armagh had a population of approximately 3,000 persons, ‘almost all Scottish or English, with very few Irish’. This contrasted with the towns and villages in County Armagh which, according to Plunkett, were mainly inhabited by Catholic leaseholders and peasants. In the town of Dungannon, Plunkett believed that of 1,000 families barely twenty were not English or Scottish. A description of County Donegal from April 1683 noted that it was ‘plentifully planted with Protestant inhabitants, especially with great numbers out of Scotland’."
