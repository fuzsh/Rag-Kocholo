As well as being a historical site and popular place to visit, it is primarily a Christian place of prayer and worship.\n\nHere you will find information about services and events in Down Cathedral, a little about our history and ongoing ministry today.\n\nIf you would like any further information or would like to send a prayer request please use one of the contact forms elsewhere on this site.\n\nDown Cathedral stands prominently on the Hill of Down, overlooking the ancient and historic town of Downpatrick.\n\nIt is a special place steeped in history and prayer. Tradition holds that Patrick was buried on the Hill of Down and for over 1600 years Christians have worshipped on this site. They still do.\n\nWith a host of fascinating features to see both inside and out, Down Cathedral is one of the destinations on St Patrick’s Trail and well worth a visit for pilgrims and tourists alike.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to this sacred place.\n\nUse this form for general information requests or just to say hello.\n\nFor prayer requests please use the form on our Prayer for Healing page which, if you wish, allows for anonymous submissions.\n\nIf you have a tour request please go to the Tours page."
