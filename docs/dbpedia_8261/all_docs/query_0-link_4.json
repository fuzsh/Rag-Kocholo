[4]\n\nThere are conflicting reports about James Shields' date of birth. Some list it as May 6, 1806 others as May 12, 1806, [5] and others in 1810.[6]\n\nHe emigrated to the United States in 1826, studied law and began practice at Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1832. He was sent to the legislature in 1836, elected state auditor in 1839.\n\nJames Shields applied for US naturalization on 21 October 1840. [7]\n\nin 1843, Shields was appointed a judge of the Illinois state supreme court and in 1845 made commissioner of the general land office. When the war with Mexico began, he was appointed a brigadier -general, his commission dating from 1 July 1846, and was assigned to the command of the Illinois contingent.[8][9]\n\nJames Shields saw much action in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.[10] He served under Gen. Zachary Taylor on the Rio Grande, under Gen. John E. Wool in Chihuahua, and through Gen Winfield Scott's campaign. At Cerro Gordo, he gained the brevet of major -general and was shot through the lung. After his recovery he took part in the operations in the valley of Mexico commanding a brigade composed of marines and of New York and South Carolina volunteers and at Chapultepec he was, again, severely wounded. He was mustered out on 20 July 1848 and in the same year, received the appointment of governor of Oregon territory. This office he resigned on being elected US senator from Illinois, as a Democrat, and served from 3 Dec 1849 till 3 March 1855.\n\nShieldsville township, located in Rice county, southern Minnesota, is named after General Shields. The village of Shieldsville was platted by James Shields in 1856, and founded around St Patrick's Catholic church located there.\n\nJames Shields married in 1861 to Mary Ann Carr.\n\nSon James Shields Jr was born on May 15th 1866, and baptized on Oct 4th the same year.[11][12]\n\nSon Charles was born on February 15th 1868, and baptized on March 11th.[13][14]\n\n1870 U. S. Federal Census[15] Carroll County, Missouri, USA\n\nGrand River Township\n\n9 July 1870\n\n606-611\n\nShields, James, 60 yrs., male, white, farmer, Real Estate $2500; Personal Property $$1200; b Ireland\n\nShields, Mary Ann, 35 yrs., female, white, keeping house, b Ireland\n\nShields, James, 4 yrs., male, white, b MO\n\nShields, Charles, 2 yrs., male, white, b MO\n\nShields, James, 22 yrs., male, white, living at home\n\nShields, Mary, 18 yrs., female, white, living at home\n\nAfter the expiration of his term he removed to Minnesota and when the state government was organized he returned to the U S senate as one of the representatives of the new state, taking his seat on 12 May 1858 and serving until 3 March 1859. At the end of his term he settled in California and at the beginning of hostilities in 1861 was in Mexico where he was engaged in superintending a mine. Hastening to Washington, he was appointed a brigadier- general of volunteers on 19 August. He was assigned to the command of Gen. Frederick W. Lander's brigade, after the latter's death. and on 23 March 1862 at the head of a division of Gen. Nathaniel P. Bank's army in the Shenandoah valley. He opened the second campaign with the victory at Winchester, VA. after receiving a severe wound in the preparatory movements on the preceding day. He was in command at Port Republic on 9 June and was defeated by Gen. Thomas J. Jackson. Resigning his commission on 28 March 1863, he settled in California but soon removed to Carrollton, Missouri, where he resumed the practice of law. He served as a railroad commissioner and was a member of the Missouri legislature in 1874 and 1879. He thus became the only man to represent three different states in the US senate, (Illinois, Minnesota, & Missouri)[16]\n\nHe died 1 June 1879 at age 69 in Ottumwa County, Iowa, USA. He was buried at the St. Mary's Cemetery in Carrollton, Carroll County, Missouri.[17] He was of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nHe is also known for the \"duel\" he nearly fought with Abraham Lincoln over a practical joke instigated by Mary Todd, whom Lincoln was courting at the time. The \"duel\" came to naught. While the seconds were arguing over protocol, Lincoln and Shields conferred, Lincoln apologized, and they made their peace. The following newspaper accounts all differ in details, and all are reported decades after the event, so the real true facts may never be known. (They range from concise, to dramatic, to down-right amusing)\n\nNewspaper References to the Lincoln-Shields Duel in 1842\n\nThis version of the story is published about 25 years after the fact, The Evansville Journal July 25th 1867, page 3.[18]\n\n\"Memphis Daily Appeal\" May 10, 1878.[19]\n\n\"The Times\" of New Bloomfield, Pa. printed this brief account on August 5th, 1879, Page 2.[20]\n\nAn account of the famous Lincoln-Shields duel that was called off, was reported in \"The Ohio Democrat\" in 1893.[21]\n\n\"The Citizen\" of Berea Kentucky, printed several \"Honest Abe\" tales in the Feb 19th 1909 [22]\n\nA nice bio of General Shields was printed (30 years after his death) in the \"Catholic Bulletin\" Feb 8th 1913 page 8.[23]\n\nThe Fergus County Democrat (Lewistown, Montana) gave it's version of the duel story in the March 5th 1912 article on page 3.[24]\n\nSome 74 years after the fact, yet again the story of the duel pops up in this article in \"The Ogden Standard\" July 5th 1916 page 8.[25]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nRegarding the ancestry of General James Shields, his grandfather is said to have been Patrick Shields who was caretaker of Altmore Barracks from 1743 onwards. General Shields was born in Altmore House[26] on the same estate, the remains of which are situated a short distance from Barracktown House on the Cappagh Road. In 2001, John and Rose Morris, who had newly acquired the site, posted to the County Tyrone Message Board their desire to share any information on the Shields family.[27]\n\nAnother source would be \"Domhnach Mor\" by Father Eamon O Doibhlin. It has Shield items, including a reference to Patrick Shield of Cappoh (probably now Cappagh). He was keeper of Altmore Barricks and progenitor of a prominent family there. We are talking 1740s. The book also has many references to a Sheale family, who were the only surviving Catholic landlords in Donaghmore. This name may have become Shield. There is a connection between Patrick Shield and General James Shield, the American General and Senator.\n\nWill of Charles Shields, dated 22 January 1810.[28]\n\nExecutors: Daniel Shields, bro/o Charles and Daniel McDonald of Skinahergina, a bro-in-law.\n\nProvisions made for wife.\n\nLanded property to sons...James and Daniel with Patrick (b 17 March 1810) being born after the will was written.\n\nProbate granted at Consistorial Court of County Armagh, Ireland to Daniel Shields (Charles' brother) on 22 October 1816.\n\nWill of James Shiel of Charleston, U.S.A., uncle of (Gen.) James Shields.[29]\n\nWritten 10 December 1827\n\nNames, Daniel and Patrick, sons of dec'd brother, Charles\n\nNames sisters:\n\nElisa Quin, wf/o James Quin of Golosha\n\nNancy Quin, wf/o Daniel Quin of Tolom\n\nMary Nugent, wf/o Felix Nugent of Gortin Catherine McHugh and/or McVeigh, widow (both names given in records, perhaps she married twice)\n\nExecutors: James Fox and Elizabeth Ann Dowling of Charleston, SC.\n\nSigned his name: James Shields\n\nLeft his gold watch to James Shields.\n\n[[Shields-4772|Hon. James Shields], (given erroneously as uncle of Gen./Sen. James Shields), was born about 1762 Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland; schooled in University of Glasgow, Scotland (1782-1786); attended medical college for two years; emigrated to the United States in July 1791; settled in Frederick County, Virginia, where he taught school. He moved to Butler County, Ohio in 1801, but then returned to Virginia and became a citizen of the United States in 1804; and married 26 January 1804 to Jane Wright (1781-1816). He returned to Butler County, Ohio in 1807 and was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives between 1806 and 1827. He was the Ohio Presidential elector in 1828 for Andrew Jackson. He was elected as a Jacksonian to the 21st United States Congress (4 March 1829 – 3 March 1831). [30][31]\n\nAccording to a correspondent, an Irish researcher, and his recent sharing of Patrick Shields line with ASH, indicates Gen./Sen. James Shields b 1810 did have an uncle named James Shields b 1743 - d 1827, who is said to have come to America. (The above will of James Shiel of Charleston, South Carolina, USA, appears to have been this James Shields b 1743.[32]) It should be noted that it appears that Gen./Sen. James Shields was born in Ireland and likely Catholic; Hon. James Shields was born in Northern Ireland and likely Protestant.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Elected to the 31st Congress, but was not seated because he had not been a citizen for the required nine years. He reached that mark on October 21, 1949, so his subsequent election was accepted by the Senate, vacant March 15, 1849 – October 27, 1849.\n\n↑ Biographical Directory of the United States Congress [1]\n\n↑ Mapped location of Altmore https://www.townlands.ie/tyrone/dungannon-middle/pomeroy/altmore/altmore/\n\n↑ James_Shields_(politician,_born_1806) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Shields_(politician,_born_1806)\n\n↑ https://memory.loc.gov/service/gdc/lhbum/0866h/0866h_0763_0783.pdf\n\n↑ https://www.google.com/books/edition/Collections_of_the_Minnesota_Historical/IkREAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=shields+family+Altmore+Tyrone+Ireland&pg=PA711&printsec=frontcover\n\n↑ United States Senate election, expulsion, and censure cases, ...
