        "text": "County Down takes its name from the county town of Downpatrick (from the Irish, Dún Pádraig, sometimes translated as “Patrick’s Stronghold”). The county’s ties to Saint Patrick begin in the township of Saul, where from he is said to have conducted his first mass in Ireland. They end in his death; his granite tomb, carved out of the Mourne Mountains, underpins the cathedral at Downpatrick where he is supposedly interned, alongside fellow patron saints Brigit and Columba.\n\nCounty Down is also closely tied to the bordering county of Antrim and shares the same stretch of coastline along Belfast Lough. The city of Belfast is itself met at the peripheries, in the north of the county, while the shoreline of Lough Neagh, shared disproportionately with four other counties, borders the northwest.\n\nArds Peninsula, constituting a well-known area of conservation and the largest inlet in the United Kingdom, wraps protectively around Strangford Lough. The peninsula distinguishes itself by its minute fishing villages, petite little islands that closely frame the coast (at least one of which is accessible by a connecting bridge to the mainland) and solitary holiday resorts. In addition to miniature scenery and a strange beauty that only improves with the number of miles on the clock, this area of County Down is notable for the beautifying vision of a great number of 17th century ruins, which offer more to the eyes than they do to the brain. The highlight, the Nendrum Monastic Site, once a Christian monastery (possibly founded during the 5th century), is located on Mahee Island in the centre of the Strangford Lough.\n\nDundrum Castle, also in ruins, was built during the 13th century by John De Courcy to overlook both the Mourne Mountains and Dundrum Bay. Seen on the horizon, this mountain range and particularly the peak at Slieve Donard, the highest in Northern Ireland at 2,790 feet, seem to emerge from the Irish Sea, rising high above the south end of the town of Newcastle (a well-known seaside resort). A fascinating structure named the Mourne Wall, built between 1904 and 1923, encircles twelve mountainous peaks in the mountains at a stretch of 22 miles. Despite being situated almost directly south of Belfast (capital of Northern Ireland), these mountains are separated from the Republic of Ireland by a mere lough.\n\nSee Mourn Mountains and learn more on our day tour from Belfast to Dublin!\n\nUnmissable Attractions County Down\n\n1.
