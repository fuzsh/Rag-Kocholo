        "text": "County Down, Northern Ireland, offers a huge number of attractions and activities – whether you’re keen on exploring historic sites, enjoying the natural beauty of this part of Ireland, or indulging in local cuisine, this region promises a rich and varied experience. From the majestic Mourne Mountains, inspiring the works of C.S. Lewis, to the tranquil shores of Strangford Lough, County Down is a destination that captures both the heart and imagination.\n\nIf you appreciate history, the county is home to several notable attractions, including the grand Castle Ward, and the fascinating Down County Museum. Belfast is also a must-see for its vibrant culture and historical significance. For those who prefer a more active approach, the area boasts some of the most breathtaking landscapes in Northern Ireland, perfect for walking and hiking. With well-marked trails and scenic routes, those looking for an active holiday have plenty to choose from.\n\nHelen’s Tower, conserved and cared for by Irish Landmark Trust offers guests unique accommodation and features a cosy sitting room with a fireplace with poetry of Tennyson and Kipling lining the walls.\n\nWhere to Stay in County Down – Helen’s Tower\n\nHelen’s Tower is a captivating stone tower located deep in the woodlands of the Clandeboye Estate in County Down, Northern Ireland. Built in 1848 by Frederick Lord Dufferin, this historic property was named in honour of his mother, Helen. The tower’s literary significance was immortalised by the famous poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who penned a poem bearing its name. It makes for an interesting stay, off the beaten path.\n\nThe history of Helen’s Tower\n\nThe property is located in the scenic surrounds of Clandeboye Estate. It forms part of the Columban Way, a heritage trail between Comber and Bangor covering 20 miles (32 km); a trail to experience the area’s rich and diverse history, Bronze Age relics, monastic settlements, Viking attacks, industrial heritage and military influences in both the First and Second World Wars.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, a training camp was established at Clandeboye estate for the newly formed 36th (Ulster) Division. New recruits trained in military discipline, drill and how to fight with rifle and bayonet, but also in the art of trench digging, which they practised regularly to both improve skills and increase fitness levels. Camp life was basic for the first few months as field kitchens and permanent accommodations were not completed until December 1914. A finished camp plan shows over 90 new buildings on the estate and records over 2100 personnel, officers and other ranks, which could be accommodated within the camp.\n\nDay One: Explore Crawfordsburn Country Park\n\nAfter checking in and settling into the Tower, take a drive to Crawfordsburn Country Park ( approx. 20 minutes). Crawfordsburn Country Park is a large green space spanning 190 acres in County Down, located along the coast. It features woodlands, walking trails, meadows, and streams. The Old Deer Park area within the park has fallow deer roaming freely.\n\nVisitors can walk along the trails, go hiking, cycle, and enjoy picnics. The diverse landscapes cater to visitors of all fitness levels and ages, with a ‘choose your own’ approach to the possible walking routes. There are several routes, ranging from less than one kilometre to three kilometres.\n\nWith its natural scenery and outdoor activities, Crawfordsburn Country Park makes for an enjoyable first day out in County Down’s countryside.\n\nFor visitors driving to Crawfordsburn Country Park, there are several parking options available, including a main car park, a lay-by on the exit road, Fort Road Car Park, Grey Point Fort and Sea Park, and spaces along Coastguard Avenue.
