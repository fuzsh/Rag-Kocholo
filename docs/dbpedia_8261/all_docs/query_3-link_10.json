        "text": "A short break with a difference in County Down\n\nThe incredible standard of spa hotels, golf courses, famous tourist attractions and restaurants make this the perfect setting for a weekend of luxury and indulgence. What’s more, there's history and heritage around every corner, meaning you can look forward to countless picturesque towns and villages along coastlines and inland that will surprise and delight you.\n\nStart with sea air and sustenance on the Ards Peninsula\n\nStart your break and build an appetite for the adventures ahead, with an inspirational drive down the Strangford Lough side of the Ards Peninsula, south-easterly of Belfast. Enjoy gorgeous views over the calm waters and plan for a pit stop at the impressive National Trust's Mount Stewart as your first stop. Take a tour of the stately home, stroll around the award-winning gardens and stop into the coffee shop for handmade bakes and a coffee.\n\nFrom here, it’s not far to the heritage village of Greyabbey, named for its abbey (Grey Abbey), considered to be the best example of Anglo-Norman Cistercian architecture in Northern Ireland. Explore the visitor centre and abbey church, before a browse through the village’s antique shop for a true sense of the local history and heritage.\n\nFurther along the peninsula, the Gransha Road takes you to the Echlinville Distillery, part of The Spirit Trail, where a guided tour brings you into the detail of the distillation process from field-to-glass, including the barley growing in the surrounding fields and the age-old tradition of distillery floor malting. The earthy aromas really bring your senses to life, and you might want to stop in after the tour to enjoy a glass of their Whiskey, gin or poitín in the on-site bar.\n\nWith a souvenir bottle safely stowed in the boot, head south to Portaferry, the end point on the peninsula and also the staging post for sea trips around the lough and the ferry, which carries passengers over to Strangford across the surging tidal race.\n\nStaying the night in Portaferry itself offers plenty of interesting options, including The Portaferry Hotel (3*) with individually decorated rooms, antique furniture and food served until 8pm, and The Old Bank which is a two-bed self-catering base, packed with quirky details from its banking past combined with modern facilities.\n\nTake the ferry to Strangford and make for Winterfell and Newcastle\n\nAn early morning ferry ride from Portaferry brings you across one of the most powerful tidal races in Great Britain and Ireland, to picturesque Strangford and beyond.\n\nOne of the big draws in these parts is Castle Ward. A National Trust property, this attractive medieval castle estate is well worth a visit - explore the grounds and the working farmyard and outbuildings which house a variety of artisan trades. What makes this place extra special, however, is its association with Game of Thrones where Castle Ward became the spectral and atmospheric Winterfell.\n\nLeaving the dramatic castellated silhouette behind you, you may wish to head towards Ardglass Golf Course, a unique Links course that hugs the coastline and offers many challenges. The Irish Sea is visible from all 18 tees and greens and on a clear day it is possible to see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man.\n\nThe seaside town of Newcastle is your next destination, set at the foot of the Mourne Mountains and featuring a popular promenade for walking along the sea front. For food and drinks options you'll be spoiled for choice, with the charming Hugh McCann’s pub, a traditional Irish bar renowned for serving fantastic hearty food and traditional Irish music. Alternatively, try Brunel's which is named after the world's most famous engineer and known for constructing its own impressive dishes. Or if you're searching for seafood, the Mourne Seafood Bar in nearby Dundrum has a phenomenal reputation, using locally-sourced ingredients that are second to none. From crispy whitebait to king prawn linguini to fried whole bream, every dish represents the very best the local waters have to offer.\n\nIf you're hoping to indulge in a spot of luxury, and perhaps some pampering, check into the magnificent Slieve Donard Hotel and Spa (4*), where the spa boasts stunning views out over the mountains and sea.\n\nTheir range of relaxing treatments includes hot stone therapies, facials, massage, pedicures and manicures, all of which guarantee to help you wind down for the evening. Although, if you prefer to finish off with a nightcap make for The Percy French, a lovely spot with friendly locals.\n\nFrom barons to saints through Castlewellan and Downpatrick\n\nA night at Slieve Donard Resort and Spa can’t fail to set you up for yet another inspiring day in County Down, and the nearby town of Castlewellan is a charming spot to head for. The Forest Park is very popular with walkers, mountain bikers and water enthusiasts, and those with a relative level of fitness should head for the a short but pleasant walking trail just beyond the lake, covering around 2.5 miles along relatively flat terrain, which takes in the great views of Slievenaslat and the Scottish baronial Castlewellan Castle, built in 1856.\n\nFor more culture, head to Downpatrick to visit the excellent Saint Patrick’s Centre (winner of Most Innovative Business (Small) at the Giant Spirit Awards 2022). This modern exhibition combines narration, sculpture, cinema and audio techniques which relate the adventures of Patrick's life and the major impact of Irish Missionaries on Dark Age Europe. It's open all week (9am - 5pm) except during July and August when it's open on Sundays only, and visitors can explore St Patrick's legacy further with a visit to nearby Down Cathedral where he is buried under a simple slab of granite.\n\nFrom Downpatrick take the road to Killyleagh to enjoy some final views of Strangford Lough and its many tiny islands, including your next pitstop on Sketrick Island where you’ll find Daft Eddy’s, a great place to stop for a bite to eat or a drink whilst enjoying the fabulous views, cheers-ing to a wonderful three days spent exploring the area.\n\nWe hope this travel guide for County Down proves useful, and has given you helpful suggestions for inspirational places to see, stay in and things to do whilst you're here. As you'll no doubt discover, no two trips here are ever the same, and you’ll likely find more inspiration at every turn."
