Ardtole Church a ruined late medieval church is situated on hilltop overlooking the sea and the Isle of Man.\n\nBallygowan\n\nA few km inland from Comber and set amid a typically rural scene, is the village of Ballygowan. The village is a minor market centre for the surrounding rural district, with increasing importance as a residential village for commuters travelling mainly to Belfast. ‘Baile Mhic Gabhann’, translated to English means ‘townland of Mac Gabhann’.\n\nBallyhalbert\n\nBallyhalbert is located along the Ards Peninsula and is home to an 800 year old castle mound, a standing stone and the ruins of an old church and there is evidence too of Ballyhalberts early trading connection, the locals here speak with an accent as broad as any Scot.

The great hill on the south of the river presented a huge problem to the horse drawn Royal Mail coaches of old who threatened to bypass the town which would have resulted in lost trade. The action taken as a result of this threat can be seen today in a feature that makes Banbridge like no other town in Ireland. In 1834 the wide main street was divided into three sections with an underpass cut out into the middle to lower the hill and a bridge built over the gap. The bridge is called the Downshire Bridge, also known locally as ‘The Jinglers Bridge’ while the underpass is known as ‘The Cut’.\n\nBangor\n\nBangor is a pleasant traditional seaside resort with a little light industry, it is very much a dormitory town efficiently linked by road and rail with Belfast 12 miles away.

Built mostly by Sir Arthur Rawdon, whose famous formal gardens have vanished, the town has a habit of winning civic flower awards. For most of the year the place is a mass of flowering shrubs, roses, flowerbeds and hanging baskets. On the north side, a long grassy avenue terminates in Moira parish church, a rather top heavy but most appealing building of 1723 where William Butler Yeats was curate in the 1830’s. The communion rails came from the staircase of the Rawdon mansion. Looking down from the church, the lawns seem to continue unbroken, into the flowerbeds and trees of the old Rawdon demesne but they are in fact bisected by the busy A3 trunk road. The road opposite Station Road leads to Berwick Hall, a thatched yeoman’s house of 1700. Moira was the scene of a victory in AD637 by the King of Tara over Comgall, King of Ulster.\n\nNewcastle\n\nNewcastle is a lively seaside resort situated approximately 48 km south of Belfast and 139 km north of Dublin.

Hill Street, the traditional retail centre of the town, offers a plethora of brand names with many family owned businesses continuing to trade side by side. Indeed many bargains can be found in its colourful and historical variety market, which celebrates its 450th Birthday in the millennium.\n\nNewtownards\n\nNewtownards a manufacturing and market garden town a bit inland from the head of the lough, dates from the thirteenth century when a Dominican priory was founded by Walter de Burgh.\n\nPortaferry\n\nPortaferry has a beautiful site on the east side of the entrance to Strangford Lough. The long, low waterfront of cottages, terraces, pubs and small shops is best appreciated from the car ferry which takes you crabwise across the narrows to Strangford village in barely five minutes.\n\nRathfriland\n\nFrom the square at Rathfriland on top of a steep hill, five streets with stepped terraces fall away sharply on all sides. Before the combustion engine, the cheery residents usually walked home, getting out of their traps and carts to spare the ponies. The town has a mid-week variety market in the square and 3 livestock sale days a week. During the nineteenth century potato famine, the market house (1770) was used as a soup kitchen though Rathfriland was spared the worst, since cereals as well as potatoes were grown locally. Four substantial Presbyterian churches are testimony to past differences of opinion. The old Quaker meeting house is now a scout hall, and the small shop with pointed windows on the first floor was originally the town’s Methodist chapel. A very prominent funnel shaped water tower occupies the high point in the riverless town, near the site of a sixteenth century Magennis castle, now vanished. This part of County Down has distinguished connections with pioneer Canada. The intrepid Catherine O’Hare, mother of the first European child born west of the Rockies was herself born in Rathfriland in 1835. She and her husband, Augustus Schubert, joined 200 Overlanders who went west in search of gold, and blazed the trail for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Rathfriland has not yet erected a memorial to this remarkable woman, though in Kamloops city park British Columbia is named after her, and Armstrong also has a monument.\n\nRostrevor\n\nThe road into Rostrevor winds past a tall granite obelisk erected in memory of Major General Robert Ross. He was commander of a small British force which captured Washington in 1814 after unexpectedly defeating the Americans at Bladensburg. Palm trees and mimosa flourish in the mild climate of Rostrevor. There are oak trees in the square, nice old houses, and a long seafront.\n\nSaintfield\n\nSaintfield, on the northerly point of the Down District, has become a desirable place to live due to its quality of life and easy commuting distance with Belfast. The town has been a regular winner in the Ulster and Britain in Bloom competitions which have involved the entire community. Evidence of its charm can be seen by the colourful fragrant displays of flowerbeds, windowboxes and hanging baskets. Saintfield has several welcoming little tea rooms and eating places, traditional village pubs and curio and antique shops.\n\nScarva\n\nIn the west of the district along the Newry/Portadown canal is the historic village of Scarva where King William’s army of 30,000 men camped in June 1690 before marching south to meet the forces of King James at the Battle of the Boyne the folowing month. Each year a sham fight and pageant takes place on 13 July on the old training ground used by King William’s army before they marched to victory at the Boyne.\n\nSeaforde\n\nSeaforde lies in the south Down area just to the north of the famous Mountains of Mourne. There are several forest parks in the area, nearby Downpatrick has a racecourse.\n\nStrangford\n\nAn area of astonishing beauty both in an out of the water, Strangford Lough lies between the great arm of land that forms the Ards Peninsula in the east and the main body of County Down in the West. This 15 mile long sea haven, scattered with small islands is home to migrant birds, common and grey seals and other marine animals. Its maritime wildlife is among the richest in Europe making it Northern Ireland’s first Marine Nature Reserve as wel as An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and an Area of Special Scientific Interest with six National Nature Reserves within its reaches. Just south of Strangford village is Cloghy Rockys, a great vantage point for seals. In summer some 20% of the Irish seal populations can be found basking along this part of the shore at low tide.\n\nWaringstown\n\nThe founder of Waringstown built himself a two storey Jacobean-style gentleman’s house, one of the first unfortified houses in Ireland (1667). A third storey was added later. A handsome flaky pink painted mansion with tall Tudor revival chimneys, it looks solid enough but is actually built of mud and rubble. Across the road are seven curious terraces in sets of three and four houses, with scalloped garden walls and railings-some of Waring’s seventeenth century cottages rebuilt in 1930’s style. The Waring fortune was founded on linen and Dutch style houses were built along the main street for the weavers, most of whom came from Flanders. The present white-washed houses with flowerbeds, though modern, have a certain harmony. A yeoman’s house built 1698, now a restaurant, founded in 1851, fields a strong team. The big house and the parish church (1681) had the same designer, James Robb, chief mason of the King’s works in Ireland. The church’s Jacobean interior is largely of ancient oak-roof, panelling, choir screen and a notable pulpit."
