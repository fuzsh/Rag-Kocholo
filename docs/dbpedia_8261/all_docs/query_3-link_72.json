        "text": "I'm looking for context about life in County Down (or Belfast) in the 70s.\n\nMy English parents moved me and my sister to Bangor in 1975 when I was two. We left 3 years later.\n\nWe lived in Weatherby - my Dad worked in retail and had a good job. Something happened and he took a job as a manager in Stewarts Supermarket in NI. I suspect he was fired and because they were desperate for retail managers, they took him without a reference.\n\nBoth my parents were abusive with a complete disregard for our safety. But even for them, it seems a hugely risky move.\n\nMy Dad was of Catholic descent but didn't practise, while my Mum was a practicing Catholic. We had a Irish surname which was associated with a Catholic area.\n\nWe were English, living in a Protestant area as Catholics. I remember starting (a Protestant) school and my Mum explaining that some of the children might not speak to me.\n\nI have just watched 'Peace Babies' on BBC1 and it made me think about some of the things I would have experienced as a young child.\n\nI am no contact with my entire family so no one to ask. My only memories were our lovely garden and my first (and best) school teacher. It was the best time in my childhood.\n\nDid my parents take a risk moving there - I'd just like to understand a bit more about it.\n\nMany thanks if anyone can help.\n\nEdited by MNHQ to remove identifying information\n\nThanks for the replies - I remember loving the place so I'm definitely not looking to stoke a fire of anger against my parents.\n\nIt was after watching the BBC programme I realised that I knew nothing about that part of my life.\n\nI knew my parents had chosen a nice area but the stuff my Mum told me, for example, soldiers with guns frisking young children, I have no idea if it happened. My Mum is a liar and a fantasist, so most of the things she said had an element of untruth about them.\n\nIt sounds like a legitimate (if unusual at the time) move made to Bangor.\n\nI am curious as to what prompted it though, but know I'll never find out. All he would say is he 'got boxed in a job' and needed a 'sideways' move."
