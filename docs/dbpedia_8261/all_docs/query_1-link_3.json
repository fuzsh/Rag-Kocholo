        "text": "About This Statue\n\nJames Shields, born on May 12, 1806, emigrated from Ireland as a young man. He taught school, studied law, and was admitted to practice.\n\nHe served in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1836, became the state auditor in 1839, and was a member of the Supreme Court of Illinois from 1843 to 1845.\n\nWhile serving in the Illinois House, Shields met Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln was a Whig and Shields was a Democrat; the two clashed rhetorically and once even scheduled a duel.\n\nShields served in the Mexican War and was injured in the Battle of Cheruhisco.\n\nHe served briefly as governor of the Oregon Territory before being elected to the U.S. Senate, where he represented Illinois for one term. Defeated for re-election, he then moved to Minnesota, where he served from 1858 to 1859 as one of the first senators from that state.\n\nDuring the Civil War Shields served as a brigadier general with the Union Army.\n\nAfter the war he continued his active political life. He was a member of the Missouri legislature and served as senator from Missouri in 1879, thus becoming the only senator to have represented three states.\n\nHe died in office on June 1, 1879."
