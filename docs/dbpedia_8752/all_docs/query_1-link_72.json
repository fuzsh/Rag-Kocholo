        "text": "“Never is it easy to explain the complexities that nurture the sudden emergence of an art movement which breaks abruptly\n\nwith the restrictive pressures of its past. However, there is no question whatsoever that Oscar Cahén had a notably\n\nsignificant impact upon the development of the young men who were to group together as Painters Eleven. He was, after\n\nall, a worldly experienced man whose technical facility as an artist was surpassed, if possible, by his vitality as a companion. For a young Canadian dealing with the conflict of breaking with the literal representational traditions of his immediate past, Oscar Cahén’s agility in moving back and forth between literal drawings and bold abstract paintings must have been a consolation as well as an example.\n\nWho could doubt the strength of his abstract compositions in which form, and space were dealt with in new terms even as colour was handled with a flamboyance that must have almost seemed, at times, a joyful scandal. This new Canadian indeed made a great contribution to his new home...\n\nNo-one can deny that, the art historical fact of the importance of his influence being put aside, Oscar Cahén was essentially a splendid imaginative figure.”"
