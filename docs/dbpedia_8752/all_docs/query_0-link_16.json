        "text": "KAZUO NAKAMURA: LIFE & WORK, by John G. Hatch, spotlights the career of this distinguished Japanese Canadian artist (1926-2002), whose painting practice spanned landscapes, cityscapes, still life studies, and lyrical, geometric and numerical abstractions. Born and raised in Vancouver, Nakamura endured internment in his teens during World War II and involuntary relocation to Ontario. A prolific artist from his earliest years, he pursued formal art studies in Toronto and gained critical attention in the 1950s as a member of Painters Eleven. As author Hatch emphasizes, Nakamuraâ€™s work was strongly influenced by his scientific curiosity and his investigations of numerical sequences to make visible universal patterns and structures in nature."
