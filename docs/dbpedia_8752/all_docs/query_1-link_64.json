        "text": "Kazuo Nakamura's art has its roots in the visual patterns found in nature. His keen interest in science and mathematics was a way of rediscovering the structure of our world. In this animation, Jenkins attempts to recreate Nakamura's work using paint on glass animation. A selection of Nakamura's paintings and sculptures have been animated as if they are being created in front of our eyes, like constantly growing and evolving plants. Set to music performed and composed by Paul Intson, with Ron Korb improvising on flute. Part of the Toronto Animated Image Society's (TAIS) Eleven in Motion program."
