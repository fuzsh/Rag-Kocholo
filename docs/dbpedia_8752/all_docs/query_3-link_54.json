Come virtually explore the AGO Collection by activating your senses as you experience a selection of artworks through visual audio description, touch, smell and/or sound.\n\nHow can artists and designers create more multisensory experiences? OCADU Graduate Students, in response to an Inclusive Design Multisensory Museum Course, share their co-creative process of translating artworks in the AGO Collection into multisensory objects. Students explore a wide variety of techniques to create an inclusive gallery experience in a series of Multisensory Museum Moments.\n\nIn this program, Jessica Hwu and Winter Yen present an inclusive, multisensory translation of Kazuo Nakamura's Blue Reflections (1962). The concept of this translation is called the forest box: a trip, an experience and a connection to the land. This translation involves visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile elements to present a comprehensive experience for users. The video is a documentary about building this forest box in the Great Toronto Area and the process of creating each element.\n\nJessica Hwu\n\nJessica is a graduate student in the Design for Health program, OCAD University, with an industrial design background. She is passionate about discovering different possibilities in the design field. As a Design for Health student, she tries to integrate her design skills and knowledge to support vulnerable groups to have a better life.\n\nWinter Yen"
