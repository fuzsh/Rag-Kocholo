        "text": "EXHIBITION OVERVIEW\n\nKazuo Nakamura (1926-2002) is celebrated for his abstract paintings that engage with the geometric forms and universal laws of nature. Distinguished by their introspective and precise qualities, Nakamura’s paintings consist of scattered light and fragmented shapes that evoke a range of natural phenomena—from the structure of subatomic particles to the vastness of a forest. “There’s a sort of fundamental pattern in all art and nature. In a sense, scientists and artists are doing the same thing. The world of pattern is a world we are discovering together,” the artist once said.\n\nBlue Dimension is a focused exhibition of 15 paintings from the AGO Collection ranging from the 1950s to 1980s. It marks twenty years since Kazuo Nakamura: The Human Measure, a major retrospective hosted by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2004."
