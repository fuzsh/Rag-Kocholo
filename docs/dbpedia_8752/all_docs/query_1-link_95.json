        "text": "The Federation of Canadian Artists (FCA), established in the wake of the 1941 Kingston Conference, became a central institution through which Canadian artists attempted to reorganize their relationship to society. In particular, members of the FCA built on a series of more long-standing concerns about the problematic relationship between art and society under conditions of modernity. The FCA&#39;s goal was to bridge the gap between the arts and life and, as such, it served as a focal point through which the artists debated the character this new relationship should take. Looking first to contribute to Canada&#39;s war effort and then post-war reconstruction, the FCA ultimately instituted a series of policies that lead it away from its original objectives even while it maintained a discourse critical of the fractured and alienating nature of modern life and culture."
