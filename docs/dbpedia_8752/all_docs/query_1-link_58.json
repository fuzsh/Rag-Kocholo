        "text": "2022 Fall Exhibitions Opening\n\nSaturday, October 1, 2022\n\n1-4pm\n\nTour at 2:15pm\n\nComing from Toronto? We have organized a bus to bring you to and from the opening! Pick up will be in front of OCADU at 100 McCaul St at 12:30PM. The bus will leave the RMG to return to OCADU at 3:45PM. Please fill out this form to reserve a spot on the bus.\n\nOn October 1, we are celebrating two new exhibitions at the RMG:\n\nAnnie MacDonell and Maïder Fortuné, still from Communicating Vessels, HD Video, 2020.\n\nThe Beyond Within\n\nAnnie MacDonell\n\nSeptember 24, 2022 – February 12, 2023\n\nCurated by: Crystal Mowry and Leila Timmins\n\nOrganized and produced in partnership with the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery\n\nAt 2:15, Annie MacDonell will deliver a tour of her exhibition with Leila Timmins.\n\nThe Beyond Within is an exhibition of recent work by Toronto-based artist Annie MacDonell, exploring feminist conceptions of the everyday as a basis for political engagement with the world. In two videos made in collaboration with Paris-based artist Maïder Fortuné, pedagogical roles are underwritten by radical forms of intimacy. OUTHERE (For Lee Lozano) and Communicating Vessels consider the potential for dissolving an isolated sense of self through friendship and art making. MacDonell’s new film installation, Set and Setting, continues this exploration by juxtaposing animated drawings sourced from early psychedelic research trials with architectural sets that recall institutional examination rooms. The piece suggests that the boundary between subject and viewer is not only thin, but porous and continuously shifting. Through these collaborative video projects and new installations, MacDonell asks whether it is possible, within static institutions and other familiar containers, to follow radical detours that create possibilities to build our worlds anew.\n\nThe Sire of Sires\n\nJordan Elliot Prosser\n\nOctober 1 – November 13, 2022\n\nCurated by: Hannah Keating\n\nThe Sire of Sires is a new video work and installation by Jordan Elliot Prosser produced during his emerging artist residency at The Robert McLaughlin Gallery. A loose adaption of L’Après-midi d’un faune – first a poem by Stéphane Mallarmé (1876), then a symphony by Claude Debussy (1894) and ballet by Vaslav Nijinsky (1912) – The Sire of Sires is the latest chapter in Prosser’s expanding video map of Oshawa. Through this film, Prosser considers the ways that lineage and reproduction are valued in Oshawa’s industrial histories and civic identity. He also inserts himself into the creative lineage of Mallarmé, Debussy, and Nijinsky, layering within the film’s narrative a reflection on the relationship between reproduction and artistic legacy.\n\nThis exhibition is supported by the RBC Foundation’s RBC Emerging Artist Project.\n\nAlso on view:\n\nTrue Currency\n\nArtists: Christina Battle, Helen Cho, Alvin Luong, Sofia Mesa, Dana Prieto, Cassie Thornton\n\nJune 18 – November 5, 2022\n\nComplete Freedom\n\nAbstract artworks from our permanent collection\n\nDecember 11th, 2021 – October 9th, 2022\n\nCome Together\n\nPhotographs from the Thomas Bouckley Collection\n\nJune 18, 2022 – January 8, 2023\n\nComing soon!\n\nKazuo Nakamura (Japanese Canadian 1926 – 2002); Cycle; 1957; oil and string on masonite; Purchase, 1971\n\nKazuo Nakamura: Universal Pattern\n\nOctober 8, 2022 – March 5, 2023\n\nCurated by: Sonya Jones\n\nKazuo Nakamura was a founding member of Painters Eleven (1953-60), Ontario’s first abstract art collective. Although sharing in the other members’ use of abstraction, Nakamura’s work was distinguished within the group by his use of more subdued brushstrokes, simpler structures and monochromatic palette. Nakamura’s fascination with science and mathematics is evident throughout his career through his use of patterns, linear perspectives, and geometric forms. From the earliest landscapes and abstractions to his later mathematical explorations, Nakamura was seeking patterns in nature. Drawing primarily from the RMG’s permanent collection, this exhibition pulls together works that reflect the scope of Nakamura’s artistic career and his constant search for truth and understanding of the world around him.\n\nThe Robert McLaughlin Gallery is an accessible venue.
