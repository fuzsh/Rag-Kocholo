        "text": "Installation of Powerful Glow at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, 2022. Image by Toni Hafkenscheid.\n\nPowerful Glow\n\nJordan Bennett, Patricia Deadman, Ursula Johnson, Mike MacDonald, Peter Morin, Luke Parnell, Archer Pechawis, Anne Riley, Fallon Simard, Becca Taylor, Art Wilson and T’uy’t’tanat-Cease Wyss\n\nNovember 26, 2022 – April 9, 2023\n\nCurated by Lisa Myers\n\nIf we think of land and waterways as readable with a range that is fluid and ever changing, living and legible, then we can see how one’s understanding of land grows over long periods of time.\n\nGathered around the medicine and butterfly artworks by the late Mi’kmaw artist Mike MacDonald, this exhibition brings together artists whose works are rooted in and stem from specific plant and land vocabularies that reflect place-based knowledge and nuanced perspectives of medicine.\n\nInstallation of Loose Parts at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, 2022. Image by Toni Hafkenscheid.\n\nLoose Parts\n\nsophia bartholomew, Akash Inbakumar, Justin Mezzapelli\n\nNovember 19, 2022 – February 19, 2023\n\nCurated by Hannah Keating\n\nLoose Parts encourages viewers to think about the intimate connection between grief, world building, and kinship. When things fall apart or their edges fray, we can see the component parts more clearly. Instinctively, especially in grief, we try to hold on, but it’s in loosening our grip and letting the pieces scatter that we find ourselves and discover tools for building new worlds. The artists in Loose Parts embrace provisional and in-between spaces, looking to ancient mythologies, dreamed-up futures, and personal stories of becoming for wisdom and ways forward.\n\nRecently Opened:\n\nInstallation of Kazuo Nakamura: Universal Pattern at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, 2022. Image by Toni Hafkenscheid.\n\nKazuo Nakamura: Universal Pattern\n\nOctober 8, 2022 – March 5, 2023\n\nCurated by: Sonya Jones\n\nKazuo Nakamura was a founding member of Painters Eleven (1953-60), Ontario’s first abstract art collective. Although sharing in the other members’ use of abstraction, Nakamura’s work was distinguished within the group by his use of more subdued brushstrokes, simpler structures and monochromatic palette. Drawing primarily from the RMG’s permanent collection, this exhibition pulls together works that reflect the scope of Nakamura’s artistic career and his constant search for truth and understanding of the world around him.\n\nRelated programming:\n\nKazuo Nakamura: Influence and Legacy\n\nFebruary 4, 2023, 2-4pm\n\nThe Ties That Bind\n\nOctober 8, 2022 – August 20, 2023\n\nCurated by Sonya Jones\n\nFeeling connected is a fundamental psychological need. In nature, ecosystems depend on interactions and connections in order to thrive. Similarly, humans flourish through connections that are physical, emotional, and social. After two years of feeling disconnected, this exhibition pulls together artwork that reflects on the different ways we seek connections, whether through relationships, finding peace and perspective in nature, or exploring shared histories.\n\nAlso on view:\n\nThe Beyond Within\n\nAnnie MacDonell\n\nSeptember 24, 2022 – February 12, 2023\n\nComplete Freedom\n\nAbstract artworks from our permanent collection\n\nDecember 11, 2021 – March 5, 2023\n\nCome Together\n\nPhotographs from the Thomas Bouckley Collection\n\nJune 18, 2022 – January 8, 2023\n\nThe Robert McLaughlin Gallery\n\n72 Queen St.\n\nCivic Centre\n\nOshawa, ON\n\nL1H 3Z3\n\nwww.rmg.on.ca\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTikTok\n\nGoogle Arts & Culture"
