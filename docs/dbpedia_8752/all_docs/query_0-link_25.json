        "text": "Painters Eleven\n\nPrimordial Fire, Jock Macdonald, (1957).\n\nApparently Canadian artists are really big on using numbers in their names. Painters Eleven (also known as P11) were an influential group of artists active from 1953 to 1960. Eleven abstract painters from Ontario: Jack Bush, Oscar Cahén, Hortense Gordon, Tom Hodgson, Alexandra Luke, Jock Macdonald, Ray Mead, Kazuo Nakamura, William Ronald, Harold Town, and Walter Yarwood came together and went on to hold their first exhibition at the Roberts Gallery in Toronto in 1954. Their exhibition was actually the first major commercial exhibition of abstract expressionist art in Toronto.\n\nTop: (L-R) Tom Hodgson, Alexandra Luke, Harold Town, Kazuo Nakamura, Jock Macdonald, Walter Yarwood, Hortense Gordon, Jack Bush, and Ray Mead. The two canvases facing forward represent the late Oscar Cahén and the canvases facing the wall are for William Ronald who had left the group in 1957. (Peter Croydon, 1957). [Source]\n\nAlthough abstract art has much earlier roots, P11 was all about the relatively new abstract expressionism movement that began to develop in New York during the 1940s and the 1950s. Art historian Denise Leclerc describes P11 as “ambitious.” They wanted to “create an impact, to make a statement about the importance abstract art was assuming in international circles and in their own work.” (Nowell). At the time, Canada wasn’t feeling the abstract vibe yet. Landscape paintings still dominated the art scene. Even more modernist styles, such as impressionism, were considered controversial—so you can imagine critics reactions to their first show.\n\nGarden, Alexandra Luke, (1958). P11 initially formed in her in Oshawa home in 1953.\n\nTo learn more about each artist, please click on the images below:\n\nDespite their nationality and having a number in their name, P11 were quite unlike the Group of Seven. They did not have a united artistic vision. They were a diverse group of individuals. Their different ages spanned across decades, their backgrounds varied, as did their occupations. What united them was their commitment to abstract expressionism and solidifying its place in the Canadian art scene.\n\nWatercolor, Kazuo Nakamura (1953)\n\nAs such, when they felt that they had achieved their goal, P11 voted to disband. By 1960, their work had been embraced by audiences and critics, their art adorned the walls of commercial and public galleries, and P11 were considered to be at the top of their game—what better time to go out? On a latter note, they were technically “P9” by this time because Oscar Cahén had died in a car crash in 1956 and William Ronald had left the group. Although some of the more senior members would pass away over the next couple of years, the younger ones went on to have storied careers and influenced Canadian art for years to come.\n\nSo what do you think of the artwork by Painters Eleven? Are you a fan of abstract art or do you prefer other styles?\n\nSources\n\n“Painters 11,” The Robert McLaughlin Gallery.
