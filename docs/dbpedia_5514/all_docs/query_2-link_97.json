        "text": "Abstract: This article is about realities embedded in the notions of “religiosity” and “Armenian religious identity” in contemporary Armenia. It is focused on some patterns of the Armenian national religion and offi cial forms of Armenian Apostolic Christianity. In particular, the article discusses links, attitudes, interrelations, contradictions and mutual infl uences of doctrinal Armenian Apostolic Christianity and its vernacular versions. The Armenian version of vernacular Christianity includes the religious practices of worshipping local saints, magic, healing and divination. An attempt to outline three conventional models of religiosity within the Armenian Apostolic Christian identity, those of “grassroots”, “privatized”, and “fundamental”, has been made in the paper, and the main patterns of attitudes among these models are discussed. In fact, these models of religiosity represent different religious subcultures, with different systems of signs and different patterns of religious mentality, though sharing the symbols, values, and priorities of Armenian Apostolic Christian identity at the national level.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this contribution is to provide a diachronic view towards the problem of classification, temporal and spatial distribution of cult-places in ancient Armenia, based mainly on archaeological evidence. Taking into account the traits of cultural landscape and topology of the Armenian Highland, the variety of known early cultic objects (sacred areas, structures, tombs, stelae, artefacts) can be divided into various temporal, social, spatial, formal, functional and behavioral groups. The present data allow us to differentiate between three major stages of development of cult-places and practices in ancient Armenia. The period of early agricultural societies during the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic Ages, which is characterized by ideological and social syncretism. Since the Early Bronze Age and especially with the Middle Bronze Age we see final separation of sacred and profane areas and clear manifestation of the appearance of elite with complex ceremonial behaviour and its development into complex state structures during the Late Bronze and the Early Iron Ages. Since the Middle Iron Age, with appearance of Urartian state, we encounter an essential distance between the elite and the profane spheres and the final formation of state religion with all typical attributes (infrastructure, anthropomorphism, monumentalism, symmetry): this process passes further into the Antique period. The traits of developments of cult-places clearly reflect the ways of social and cultural adaptation of the populations living in the Armenian Highland through time and space.\n\nThis article draws on the notion of 'cultural defense' to examine how nationalism shapes contemporary contestations around religion and secularity in Armenia. While clearly relevant, this framework has rarely been used for the analysis of religious change in the Caucasus region as part of the broader post-Soviet space. This article fills this lacuna. Simultaneously, it moves beyond the relatively narrow interest in the degree of secularization or reinforced religious nationalism as social outcomes of cultural defense situations. Instead, we are interested in how boundaries between religion and secular spheres in society are drawn in particular ways, how the resulting religious – secular configurations have evolved since the end of the Soviet Union – of which Armenia was a part – and how concepts of nationhood and nationalist mobilizations have shaped this process.\n\nPost-socialist urban dynamics in the Caucasus have been characterized by uneven processes of rebuilding and reclaiming of sacred spaces. Exploring re-emerging Shia Muslim lifestyles in post-conflict Armenia around Yerevan's Blue Mosque, I examine how a religious place is perceived and used in everyday life. Built at the end of the eighteenth century in a multi-religious environment, today the Blue Mosque is associated with the political body symbolizing the recent Iranian–Armenian friendship and with Iran's soft-power policy in the Caucasus. The ethnographic research reveals that the mosque complex is not an isolated sacred site emphasizing differences between Iranian migrants and Armenian locals, worshippers, and non-worshippers, but a spatial expression of the coming together of groups from different backgrounds and of the vernacular hybridity that existed in Yerevan in the past. In spite of the invisibility and the silence of the Blue Mosque's past from the point of view of government officials, the physical restoration of the mosque is triggering unembodied memories of people in conscious and unconscious reconstructions of the multi-religious past. The question, is to what extent does the Blue Mosque contribute to a visible rediversification of religious and ethnic life in Armenia?\n\nThe paper presents a brief survey of the traditional religious practices as still, or until recent times, observed in the Caucasus. The possibility of a pan-Caucasian “mythological union” formed over centuries between all the Caucasian communities is postulated, which is followed by the discussion of a local “mythological union” on the example of the lightning ritual Čoppa. Although the pre-monotheistic heritage, partially intertwining with the official religions, still constitutes an intimate part of the identity of some Caucasian communities, it is fading in the shadow of the mainstream religions – Christianity and Islam – which have become a strong unifying factor in the post-Soviet period."
