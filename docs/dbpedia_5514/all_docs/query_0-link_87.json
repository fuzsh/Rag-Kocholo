        "text": "Musical artist\n\nRob (Shrock) Shirakbari is an American musician, composer, record producer, and arranger, best known for being long-time music director for Dionne Warwick (1985–present) and Burt Bacharach (1996 - 2010) [1] and as producer, co-writer, and music director for Rumer (2013–present).[2]\n\nShirakbari has worked with Aretha Franklin, Adele, Sheryl Crow, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Elvis Costello, Wynonna Judd, Duffy, Ronald Isley, Peabo Bryson, Chris Botti, and Whitney Houston among other successful recording artists.

His father is a retired pharmaceutical doctor and his mother is a retired pharmacy technician. Shirakbari began playing trumpet at ten years old in his elementary school band. He later began playing guitar and teaching himself to play piano at age thirteen. His composing and conducting career started early by writing the Alma Mater for his Junior high school which was debuted with the school's concert band. He later studied piano with renowned teacher, Marjorie Mae Bond, and studied composition with Francis McBeth at Ouachita Baptist University. In high school, he played keyboards and guitar in several bands and developed his songwriting and recording skills.\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\nDionne Warwick\n\n[edit]\n\nShirakbari began working with Dionne Warwick in 1985. He has toured extensively with her around the world as her music director, arranger, and pianist. He has produced and performed on albums, Friends Can Be Lovers (1993), Dionne Sings Dionne (1998), The Best of Dionne Warwick (2001), This Christmas (2014), and She’s Back (2019).[3]\n\nBurt Bacharach\n\n[edit]\n\nShirakbari began working closely with Burt Bacharach in early 1987 when Bacharach and Warwick reunited and began touring together. Shirakbari became Bacharach's protege and was involved in recording sessions and arrangements with Bacharach. In 1996, Shirakbari became Bacharach's music director and together they wrote the arrangements for Bacharach's revamped live show, with many of the arrangements still being played in Burt's live show today. He toured extensively around the world with Bacharach until late 2010.\n\nShirakbari performed on One Amazing Night (1998), Sessions at West 54th (Bacharach/Elvis Costello) (2001), Isley meets Bacharach - Here I Am (Ron Isley/Burt Bacharach) (2003), At This Time (2005), Live at The Sydney Opera House (Mixed with Allen Sides) (2008), and What Love Can Do (Burt Bacharach/Peabo Bryson) (2009).\n\nRumer\n\n[edit]\n\nShirakbari began working with recording artist (and now wife) Rumer (musician), as her co-writer, producer, pianist, keyboardist, and arranger in 2013. The two met briefly at a World Hunger Day gala at the Royal Albert Hall in London hosted by Dionne Warwick in 2012, where Shirakbari was music director and Rumer and Warwick sang a duet of Bacharach & David's, “Hasbrook Heights.” Rumer later moved to Los Angeles in 2013, following the release of her album, Boy’s Don’t Cry, where the two began working together.\n\n2014: Into Colour (producer, musician, and arranger)\n\nShirakbari produced Rumer's second album of all original material, Into Colour, (co-written by Rumer, Rob Shirakbari, and Stephen Bishop) and her third studio album, which was released on November 10, 2014, in the UK, Ireland, and Japan.
