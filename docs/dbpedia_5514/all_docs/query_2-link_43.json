After working there for four years, in 1915 she became witness to the Armenian massacres carried out by the Young Turk authorities.

She was very young when she learnt about the Hamidian massacres (1894-1896) and sufferings of the Armenian people in the Ottoman Empire from the articles published in Danish media.\n\nThe members of the phil-Armenian movement, that began in 1890s in the Scandinavian countries and particularly in Denmark, had various enterprises and made speeches condemning the Hamidian massacres. The Danish branch of the \"Womenâs Missionary Workers\" (K.M.A.) Organization was established in Denmark in 1900: it supported Armenian orphans sheltered in German orphanages of Mush, Van, Marash and Kharberd. In 1906 after completing nursing courses, Maria Jacobsen became a member of the \"Womenâs Missionary Workers\" Organization and left for Kharberd as a missionary to help suffering Armenian people. In November 1907 the young missionary arrived in Kharberd where she was appointed as a director at a small hospital. In a short period she learnt Armenian in order to communicate with local people. At the same time she began writing her diary, which later became a valuable eyewitness testimony of the Armenian Genocide. Maria Jacobsen left her first record in the diary on September 7, 1907, and the last one was dated August 6, 1919. The voluminous diary which has 600 pages mainly presents the deportation and exile of the Armenians of Kharberd and scenes of murders ferociously perpetrated by the Turks from 1915 to 1919. For a long time the Danish missionary who was an eyewitness to the Armenian Genocide kept her diary in a secret as she had taken it out of the Ottoman Empire endangering her life. Maria Jacobsenâs diary was translated into Armenian and after her death it was published in Beirut in 1979.\n\nThe International Conference âArmenian Genocide: Challenges on the Eve of Centenaryâ Continues\n\n23.03.2013\n\nOn March 23, the international conference on the eve of centenary of the Armenian Genocide, organized by the State Commission on Coordination of the events dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide resumed.\n\nThe prominent foreign and the Armenian researchers participated in this international conference.

Further perspectives and directions of the Armenian Genocide studies and organization of museum exhibitions,\n\nb. Imperatives and efficient methods of the fight against the denial,\n\nc. Discussion of compensation for the successors of the Armenian Genocide survivors and victims, and issues related to its legal justification.\n\nThe conference will be an important harbor for efficient scholarly discussions and necessary conclusions concerning the centenary of the Armenian Genocide, for clear conclusions and recommendations in terms of the scholarly work on not yet observed or less explored issues as well as the potential support for it.\n\nThis conference will also allow developing more efficient mechanisms and methods of response to the Turkish denial. Finally, this conference is designed to develop and plan the overall strategy of various events to be organized in the Republic of Armenia and abroad on the occasion of centenary based on the professional and reputable opinion.\n\nThe conference is an opportunity to clarify the issue of elimination of consequences of the Armenian Genocide and to develop the further strategy.\n\nThe organization of such a conference, in which experts on Armenian Genocide studies take part, will be an important review on the eve of Yerevan conference of International Association of Genocide Scholars in 2015.
