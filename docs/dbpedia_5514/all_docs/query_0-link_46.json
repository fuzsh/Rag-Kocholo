        "text": "Year after year, the recipients of FAR’s scholarship programs volunteer as group leaders at some of FAR’s summer camps in Armenia. For the second year in a row, Mathevosian and Jerair Nishanian scholarship recipients who are in their final stages of college are spending their time at the Siranush camp in Yeghegnadzor. Some of these students participate in other FAR projects during the year, helping out at the senior home in Vanadzor or at the Children’s Support Foundation Center in Yerevan, for example.\n\nCredit: FAR Staff\n\nAni Kalashyan and Haykaram Avetisyan from Armenia State University of Economics and Jerair Nishanian Scholarship program beneficiaries Eduard Ghazaryan, Varazdat Avetisyan and Narek Knyazyan from Gavar State University are enthusiastically working with children between the ages of 10 and 15. Each of these children are supported year-round by the Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program, through which caring people provide monthly stipends to help their families make ends meet. CASP also enables these kids to attend camps like Siranush each summer. They come from various regions of Armenia and parts of Georgia as well.\n\nCredit: FAR Staff\n\nFor students like Ani who volunteers much of her time to FAR and who also comes from a low-income family, the camp is another way to give back and show her appreciation for the opportunity to receive an education.\n\nTwo weeks into the start of camp and the students had already grown close with the children. This was apparent to FAR staff during a recent visit. The atmosphere was filled with sheer joy.\n\nCredit: FAR Staff\n\nBy Levon Lachikyan\n\nThere are 75 CASP children currently at the Siranush Camp in Yeghegnadzor. Normally, if one looks carefully, they might notice sadness in their eyes, as none of them have fathers. During our visit, however, all seemed to be happy. Today, not every Armenian family can afford to send their child to a camp. Fortunately, Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program, which provides financial support to children in need, creates such a unique opportunity.\n\nOne of these children is Lilit Narinyan. This 14 year old has an inexplicable charm and dances beautifully. Lilit was born in town Goris and she was four when her father died. Today, she lives with her mother and brother in a rented apartment just outside of town.\n\nCredit: Felix Arustamyan\n\nOur conversation focused on many of her achievements. In 2004 she was deemed “Miss Syunik”; the same year she won second place in the “Miss Hayastan”contest. She was also named “Miss Asia” at the 2005 “Miss World” competition. She is also very accomplished in dance. As a solo dancer of the Syunik Dance Ensemble she has traveled throughout Armenia, as well as Hungary and Poland. Now she is in the tenth grade of Goris #2 secondary school. “I can’t imagine myself without dance. Dance is my life,” Lilit said.\n\nAt the Siranush camp, her everyday routine is full and she has made many new friends. This is certainly evident as her two friends Alina from Sisian sat next to her during our conversation. Both praised Lilit’s talent and expressed their wishes that she return to camp next summer.\n\nCredit: Felix Arustamyan\n\nThis week, FAR staff along with youth activities trainer Onik Avakyan helped to open this year’s session at Camp Siranush near Yeghegnadzor. Every summer, kids who are enrolled in the Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program, or CASP, have the opportunity to participate in such summer camps free of charge. FAR helps to manage CASP in collaboration with the Women’s Guild Central Council of the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America (Eastern). Through CASP, children under the age of 18 who have lost one or both parents, receive stipends from international sponsors.\n\nCredit: Felix Arustamyan\n\nThis year, 75 CASP children are attending the camp. They are joined by an additional 42 students from other universities in Armenia and Georgia, along with counselors, teachers and other staff.\n\nAvakyan led a training with camp counselors, during which they learned new activities and ways of working with the children through dance, sports and other types of creative activity to foster partnerships. After the training, he led the children in relay races and competitions that were enjoyed by all.\n\nHairstyles & Design contest among Camp children\n\nCredit: Felix Arustamyan\n\nThe Syunik Diocese runs Camp Siranush. Father Vazgen Hovhannisyan and Abraham Bishop Mkrtichyan, Primate of the Syunik Diocese also organized Christian education discussions for the children during this time.\n\nCASP children enjoying meal at camp kitchen\n\nCredit: Felix Arustamyan\n\nBy Marina Bazayeva\n\nSummer Camp: a homework-free zone, filled with fun, fresh air and friendship. For the kids supported by the Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program, it is also a work-free zone. At home many of them constantly help their mothers or grandparents do housework or care for their younger siblings. In addition, the majority of the nearly 20 kids and teenagers who are enrolled in the 20-day FAR “Siranush” Summer Camp, located near the village of Hermon in Vaiots Dzor Province (population: 53,000), have never been outside their own province.\n\nThey’ve never had a chance to socialize with their peers from other regions or compatriots from other countries. So, this newfound association will provide the local kids with a broader understanding of another world, culture and mentality. It will provide them with a sense of unity with other Armenians from all over the world as well as show them that there are an abundant variety of traditions and customs in their country.\n\nAll of this will enrich their development and build their foundation for their future. And the abundance of care, love, and lack of social problems ensure a pleasant and enjoyable stay.\n\nEvery summer, underprivileged children who are either orphaned or who come from single-parent homes are able to attend camp through the help of the Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program.\n\nChildren depart for summer camp\n\nCredit: FAR Staff\n\nFAR partners with the Women’s Guild of the Armenian Church of America (Eastern Diocese) to implement the Children of Armenia Sponsorship Program (CASP). Through close cooperation with the Dioceses in Armenia, CASP provides stipends donated from members of the Diaspora to Armenian children in need. Twice a year these stipends are organized and distributed through the Church with the help of local priests.\n\nDer Undza Mirzoyan is one of the spiritual servants of the Armenian Apostolic Church who greatly promotes the successful development of the CASP program. He was assigned to the service in May 2009.\n\nHe was born in Yerevan in 1969 and worked as an engineer for many years before changing his life and becoming a priest at the church of the Syunik region in Southern Armenia. Der Undza remains incredibly dedicated to his church, yet he is also very involved with local schools and universities, and with youth like CASP. He delights in his daily conversations with the church’s Sunday school children, through which he can help to strengthen their faith and teach them more about their heritage.\n\n“I am always where the youth are,” he said. “Our purpose is not only to share knowledge and skills with the children but also to unite them around the Armenian Church.”\n\nDer Undza with CASP Beneficiaries\n\nCredit: FAR Staff"
