Raised in Cleveland, Don attended St. Ignatius Grade School and High School, graduating in 1955. He went on to attend John Carroll University, where he laid the foundation for a life defined by hard work, integrity, and faith. After college, Don joined the family wire business, working alongside his brother, Robert (\"Sam\"), and his father. Along with his father and brother, their dedication and leadership culminated in the success of Premier Manufacturing Incorporated, a company that produced wire products for over 50 years. In 1960, Don married his high school sweetheart, Jackie, beginning a beautiful marriage that spanned 64 years and 2 months. Their union was a testament to faith, trust, mutual respect, and enduring love, values they imparted daily to their five children, eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Don’s life was centered around his faith and his family. He took great pleasure in spending summers in Hilton Head Island and cherished holiday gatherings in the family home of 46 years. He was a man of deep generosity, always ready to offer a helping hand or kind word to anyone in need. His unwavering faith guided him through life’s challenges and joys, and he instilled these values in his children and grandchildren. Don was preceded in death by his parents and his oldest son, Donald “Don” Joseph. The family takes comfort in knowing they are now reunited in peace. He is survived by his beloved wife and soulmate, Jacquelyn (“Jackie”), and their children John (Lisa), James, Matthew, and Loretta. He is also survived by his cherished grandchildren Amy Maloney (Sean), Ashley Steverding (Tim), Rachel, Johnny, Vanessa, Matthew Jr., Hope, and Ben, as well as his four great-grandchildren – Connor, Garret, Gianna, and Allison. Don leaves behind his siblings Robert (Therese), Susan O’Brien (Charles – Deceased), and Laura Sherbundy (James), along with numerous nieces, nephews, and close friends who were touched by his generosity and warmth.

In lieu of flowers the family suggests contributions to Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration 4108 Euclid Ave Cleveland, OH 44103. Karen was self-made, highly organized, independent, detailed, hard working and successful. According to Jeff, marrying her was the easiest decision he ever made. Karen’s life as a child wasn’t easy. But she always spoke lovingly of her grandparents who helped raise her. Her parents moved their family frequently, but during her senior year of high school in Dayton, Karen refused to move again. Instead, she moved in with a classmate and worked jobs after school to pay room and board. She also worked all through college to put herself through Dayton University. After graduating from college, Karen piled up her few belongings and headed for what she thought would be Arizona. Instead of Arizona, she landed a job in Oakland, California with the Clorox Company. Karen was the first woman they ever hired in marketing! She worked on teams introducing newly acquired companies and their labels. She took great pride in that. She formed great relationships with many of her coworkers. Karen was incredibly organized and capable. She supervised Clorox’s participation in the National Brokers Association annual convention. She kept everything, including her company’s 300 participants, organized and running smoothly. She could often be seen with her 3 ring binder. Later, Karen opened her own marketing company, maintaining Clorox as her primary account. Karen moved back to Cleveland when she was in her fifties. She enjoyed a close relationship with her brother Brian. That’s when she also met Jeff and they got married. After marriage, they spent much time in Arizona, where Jeff owned a condo in Tucson and Karen owned a rental home in Scottsdale. The irony was that in 1990, thirteen years prior to their meeting, they had both purchased property in Arizona! Karen loved Arizona. She and a friend started a women’s beginning golf league there. Karen was a very active volunteer at the nearby historic Tubac museum and presidio. She even ran their annual festival and fundraiser for several years. Karen loved animals. She and a friend bought two wild burros at an Arizona Bureau of Land Management auction. Maggie, Karen’s burro, was always the star when friends and neighbors visited. Karen even had Maggie transported to Tubac for one of their festivals for children to sit on and get pictures taken. The Catholic Church has been an integral part of Karen and Jeff’s lives. Karen loved hosting their priest friends for dinner. In Arizona, they were involved with the Italian Catholic Federation Club. Here in Cleveland, they were active members of the Serra Club, an international organization supporting priests and seminaries. The last several years Karen and Jeff recited the rosary together. As someone who had a good amount of jewelry, the only necklace she wore the last year while still at home was the Miraculous Medal of Mary. Karen’s devotion to Jeff shined when she spent summer after summer taking care of him as he went through various operations and procedures. She spent many hours driving him or changing dressings or making sure he was comfortable. Karen was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2018. Three years later, Jeff did the most difficult thing he had ever done, and placed Karen in a memory care facility. Later, after a broken hip and two hip replacements, Karen became dependent on total care and lost the ability to communicate. The most amazing thing was how beautiful Karen looked and how her smile brightened up the room. Her wonderful caregivers have become like family and enabled Karen not only to smile, but most importantly, kept her as healthy and comfortable as possible. Karen touched the lives of many people. And we remember her with much love and gratitude. “Eternal rest grant unto her, Oh Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her”\n\nCarolyn Castelluccio (age 85), passed away on May 29, 2024 after a brief Illness. She is survived by her sons Marc (Martha Saltis) and Kent (Jennifer); and seven grandchildren, Kaitlyn, Ryan, Brandon, Evan, Colin, Olivia and Dominic. Carolyn was the wife of Raymond Castelluccio (deceased), the founder and owner of Area Temps, one of this area's leading temporary employment services, with locations throughout Northeastern Ohio. Ray and Carolyn relocated from Cincinnati to open a chain of permanent placement services in 1968, including Search Masters and Cleveland Business Consultants. They expanded into the temporary help industry when they opened Area Temps in 1987. Carolyn was a member of the Cleveland Yachting Club and Westwood Country Club. She enjoyed golf, tennis and boating with Raymond. In recent years, she loved to read novels and played competitive mahjong games with friends. She enjoyed the Cleveland restaurant scene and was a long-time supporter of Cleveland Playhouse Square, taking in many plays and musicals.

Helen was born to Raymond and Josephine Kapl (nee Divis) on May 3, 1933 in Cleveland, OH. Helen leaves the love of her life, John (John R. Judge, MD), after 69 years of a very happy, adventuresome and always loving marriage, as well as son Michael and daughter Judi. She is also survived by cousin Carol Skozen, niece Carolyn Maciag, nephew Edward Patrick, sister-in-law Edith Patrick, and multiple great nieces and nephews and great great nephews. Helen was known for her strong beliefs, but equally known for her warm and generous heart and tender compassion to those in need of assistance and to children especially, in whom she reveled. She made friends, quickly and easily and leaves a large number of admiring long-term friends throughout the United States, Italy and South America, whom she met during a life-time of work, studies, travels and military bases during John’s Navy service and medical training. Helen knew adversity early in life, when her father Raymond died of a massive heart attack when shew was only 11 years of age and her mother had to go to work to support them, immediately thereafter. She became a Registered Nurse at age 20 at the old Fairview Park Hospital School of Nursing, a year before she could legally handle narcotic drugs, at the time. It was at Fairview Hospital that she met her future husband, John, while they were both students at different institutions, then. During her nursing career Helen was Head Nurse in Neurosurgery to Dr. John Gardner at the Cleveland Clinic, while husband John was overseas in service, as a medical officer. She later served as an Emergency Service nurse at Lakewood Hospital and after obtaining her Master’s Degree she served as Head of the Clinical Teaching Program for the Lakewood Hospital Licensed Practical Nursing Program for several years while it was then administered through the City of Lakewood. She took great pride in the fact that every single one of her students passed the Ohio Practical Nurse examination on the first attempt during her tenure. Helen later returned to her first love in Nursing as a Pediatric nurse at Lakewood Hospital, where she remained until the arrival of the couple’s children. Helen always considered her greatest job was that of wife and mother and she excelled in everything she tried from teaching PSR classes at St. Angela Church in Fairview Park to Tole painting and ceramics in art forms as well as becoming very proficient in mastering classic Italian cuisine, which she loved, and the Italian language which she studied in her later years. She was active in PTA while the children were in school and volunteered for years at several non-profit fundraising projects for the needy and the American Red Cross. She will be irreplaceably missed by her family and all who were privileged to know and love her. The family wishes to express its deep appreciation to Mrs. Patrice Campbell and to the Ennis Court staff for the loving care that Helen received while a resident there prior to her passing.

Rita was also an active member of the Western Reserve Herb Society where she thoroughly enjoyed the social gatherings and activities. As a mother, grandmother, and friend, Rita had a fabulous wit and sense of humor and was unselfishly giving to a fault. Always thinking of others, she would routinely cook meals and deliver to friends and loved ones because she was thinking of them. Often, packages of gifts would arrive in the mail to grandchildren because she was missing them. That was Rita; her greatest joy was giving. The sound of Sunday morning polka party on the radio will forever evoke a tear in her family's eyes, not of sadness, but of joy knowing that she is dancing in heaven with her loved ones and smiling down upon us. Rita was the beloved wife of the late Gilbert J.; beloved mother to Stacy Saffell (Chris), Kimberly Campbell (Chris), Tricia Sims (Mark) and Jackie Lyles (Eric); dear \"Babcia\" to Evan (Erin), Jackie (Blaise), Morgan, Kaitlin, Christopher, Abby, Jake, Madeline, Charlotte, and Delaney; sister of the late Anthony Szerszen (Donna) (deceased); daughter of the late Stanley and Charlotte (nee Wojnar) Szerszen from Monessen, PA.

She also leaves behind her brother, Stephen (Bea). She was predeceased by her husband, Charles; her parents, Stephen and Helen; sister Connie and brother-in-law Ken. Mom passed away after a brief, fierce battle with her injuries and ailments. She will be remembered as she lived life: A daughter, sister, friend, wife, mother (pseudo father after Dad passed) and grandparent. Mom grew up in Slavic village, proud of her 100% Polish heritage and immigrant parents, making friends that would last a lifetime in her neighborhood and at East High. She dreamed of travel and the great big world and her job at The Erie Lackawanna Railroad helped those dreams come true. Working with her sister and best friend Ursula, she met her future husband Charlie. Together, they worked and traveled, seeing Broadway plays, the World's Fair and places like the Copa Cabana and 30 Rock. Mom grew up with The Depression and War, Tony Bennett, party lines, cell phones, and everything in between. Soon she and Dad married and started a family, living on Cleveland's West Side until finally settling in Bay Village. Dad passed unexpectedly in 1983 and Mom carried on, raising her boys as best she could and returning to the railroad. She worked in Pittsburgh, Albany, Boston, and Jacksonville among other railroad towns, making many new friends along the way. Mom eventually retired and moved back to the Cleveland area. She pursued her love of music singing in multiple church choirs, culminating with a trip to the Vatican where she sang for Pope John Paul II, the Polish Pope. Mom traveled to Europe: Italy, Ireland and Poland, crisscrossed the United States by plane, train and automobile, and sailed the seas including the Panama Canal. Not bad for the shy little Polish girl from 55th and BroadVay! Mom was passionate and mighty, frugal yet overly generous. She will be missed by all those who knew her, and missed and loved by all of us, her family. A Funeral Mass will be held on Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 10:30 am at St Bernadette Catholic Church, 2256 Clague Rd., Westlake, Ohio with private interment to follow at Holy Cross Cemetery."
