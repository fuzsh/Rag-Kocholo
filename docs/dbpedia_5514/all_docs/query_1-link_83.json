        "text": "Early Frenchtonians is the first volume of an attempt to shed light on a 19th-century Roman Catholic immigrant community, largely from Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, which took root on a former Native American reservation in northwest Ohio. Residents of Big Spring Township, Seneca County, Ohio know the location of this “Frenchtown.” The unincorporated community of less than ten houses sprung up around a now-abandoned church, which is scheduled for imminent demolition by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo. Relatively few people outside of Seneca County know this small settlement. “Frenchtown” is remembered today not as a cluster of houses along a road, but as the vestige of a once-vibrant church community. Members of a largely Roman Catholic, French-speaking, immigrant community felt the need for a church closer to their homes, they petitioned their French-speaking bishop for recognition and a resident priest to serve them, they built three consecutive houses of worship (a log chapel and two brick churches), they provided a rectory for their priest, a school for their children, a convent for the nuns who taught their children, and a cemetery for their deceased loved ones—and the remnants of all this activity would later become known as “Frenchtown.” ​​​​​​​This volume explores the history through 1900 of this community and shares all sacramental and burial records for the church through the turn of the 20th century, thus allowing the reader to be better acquainted with…early Frenchtonians!"
