Most frequently they share their desire to reach the abortion minded and have found it is a challenge to reach them first to offer life-affirming choices before a pregnant woman steps into an abortion clinic. Our heart and mission is to help centers reach women before they walk through those doors. As you know, the target demographic you want to reach doesn’t change – but their habits and how they receive information has changed drastically over the decades.\n\nGen Z is your target audience. This generation was born between 1996 and 2014. They have never known life without the internet or smart phones and they are used to consuming lots of information instantly and constantly. Without a doubt, in order to get in front of this demographic, you need to have a digital presence.\n\nIn this download, we take a deep dive into what it means to be a member of Gen Z. We questioned some teens and young adults who are part of Gen Z and hope their answers are enlightening to you as you plan your marketing strategies to reach them more effectively!\n\nGet Resource\n\nFundraising Forecast for 2020\n\nA newly released study by Fidelity Charitable indicates that 80% of major donors plan to give the same or more than they did last year, even in the face of this crisis. Further, the study indicated that most donors do not plan to shift their giving to different organizations in light of the pandemic; they will stay the course by continuing to support their favorite nonprofits and missions they are passionate about. As an added bonus, the recently passed CARES Act also expands tax deductions for charitable giving this year, providing many major donors with a powerful incentive to give more.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? You need to simply ask.\n\nGet Resource\n\nPivoting After COVID-19 for Increased Donor Engagement\n\nI’m sure you are looking forward to getting back to normal. All of us are wondering what “normal” will look like. We long for the days before the pandemic, social distancing, and the challenge of finding toilet paper, sanitizer, and the masks you needed to meet with your clients.\n\nAt the same time, we encourage you to look ahead with hope and anticipation of the new normal and the blessings in store. Through every trial, we learn so much. At Choose Life Marketing, we have seen positives come out of this huge challenge for centers across the country. Mainly, we have seen incredible strength in all of you – you were tenacious in staying open and serving clients, you endured much hardship juggling protecting your staff, maintaining your finances and still meeting client needs. You have come out so strong – with new practices that will help you engage more with both Gen Z and your supporters.\n\nLast week we discussed ways pregnancy centers all over America are pivoting to adjust to changes brought about by COVID-19. Changes such as being more strategic with marketing and looking at best practices as you minister to those you serve. In this week’s guide, we discuss ways you can pivot to keep your donors engaged, inspired, and active in the life of your pregnancy center.\n\nGet Resource\n\nCOVID-19’s Lasting Mark: How Will Your Center Adapt?\n\nLet’s be honest. For most pregnancy centers we talk to, this pandemic has been a long road. Adapting how you serve people, worrying about finances and canceled events, keeping up with new technology to communicate with both staff and clients, wondering how long you will have to do all of this… it’s a lot.\n\nWhile we all desire to return to normalcy, part of moving forward will be learning to adapt to a “new normal.” Women’s ultimate need is the same, but how they pursue solutions to that need has shifted. They are now very comfortable being reached, served and communicated to virtually. How will you respond?\n\nIn this guide, we talk about some key ways your pregnancy center can adapt to long-lasting changes from COVID-19 to continue reaching and serving abortion-minded women.\n\nGet Resource\n\nWhat is the Google Knowledge Vault?\n\nFor the past several years, Google has been working on building a knowledge vault to store knowledge about … everything. Albert Einstein. How airplanes work. Ingredients for dairy free ice cream. Google’s goal is to create a ‘machine system’ that has the whole of human knowledge stored in one place. This will make Google search results smarter and more accurate to what people are searching for online, helping them find the information they need more efficiently.\n\nAs of 2014, the Knowledge Vault had pulled in 1.6 billion facts. Of those, 271 million were rated as “confident facts,” meaning a more than 90 percent chance of being true. It predicts this by cross-referencing new facts with what it already knows.\n\nAs you read through this, you may have concerns about privacy or how a company like Google can decide truths within the knowledge they compile. The big takeaway today is that the Google Knowledge Vault can impact your pregnancy center in three primary ways. First, it will impact your Google rankings which determines if women will see your site or not. Second, it will impact a person’s experience while on your site. And finally, it will impact whether or not someone seeking information about your services can trust the information on your site.\n\nAt the end of the day, reaching your clients with life-saving support and resources is your number one goal. In this free guide, we will help you understand how Google views information so you can maintain visibility as you keep your website ranked high in Google’s search results.\n\nGet Resource\n\nCombating Planned Parenthood\n\nDo you ever feel overwhelmed in your day-to-day work, wondering if you’re doing all you can to bring hope and truth to women in need of your services as you combat the lies the abortion industry is selling them? It’s easy to look at the lobbying power, finances, and marketing prowess of Planned Parenthood and feel discouraged. The abortion giant seems to have it all and it can feel daunting to take it on.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little like David in the David and Goliath story, take heart! David had a plan, and most importantly, he had God on his side. You do, too. No matter how big and intimidating Planned Parenthood may seem, God is for you and with you, providing the resources and light to take on the darkness of abortion.\n\nIn this guide, we share eight things you can do today to combat Planned Parenthood.

Those three years showed a decline in charitable gifts. However, during the 2008/2009 recession, the decrease was in giving that was not relationship based. Those who are most connected to nonprofits have historically stayed connected in hard times. Both your major gift development and faithful monthly givers will carry you through even in the hardest of economic downturns because of your strong relationship with them. Realistically, due to job loss and other factors, you have to expect some donors to take a break from giving. However, trends show that others will step up to help in a big way.\n\nGet Resource\n\nBest Marketing Tactics During the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nThough news of the coronavirus has been spreading for a few months, the decisions and actions of the last two weeks have impacted the United States in ways we hadn’t felt before.

Because each organization has a unique vision and mission, this is understandable. However, when it comes to what you spend to advertise, there are some downsides to your autonomy that are important to be aware of if you want to keep your marketing costs low for pro-life organizations within your same community.\n\nIf pro-life groups in the same area are not collaborating about their marketing efforts, it can drive up costs for both organizations.

For years, your primary client audience has been Millennials. Like all of us, they are aging! Older Millennials are well into their 30s. Because they grew up during a period of time with great technological changes, it’s become common to associate “Millennial” as “young, techy people,” or just young people in general. But remember, Millennials are getting older and a new audience you must focus more attention on is Generation Z.
