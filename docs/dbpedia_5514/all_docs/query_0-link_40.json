        "text": "YEREVAN — The motto and logo for His Holiness Pope Francis’ visit to the Republic of Armenia have been adopted with the corresponding description. The motto of the visit is: “Visit to the First Christian State,” President’s Press Office reports.\n\nDescription of the Logo\n\nThe logotype for the visit is in the form of a round seal. The Logo depicts the Monastery of Khor Virap with the Biblical Mount Ararat at the background. Saint Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned in a deep pit in Artashat for 14 years, where later the Monastery of Khor Virap was built. Saint Gregory the Illuminator subsequently became the first Patriarch of the Armenian nation. Through the joint efforts of Saint Gregory and King Tiridates III, Christianity was declared as a state religion in Armenia.\n\nThe background colors of the logo are purple and yellow denoting the colors of the official flags of the Armenian Apostolic Church and Roman Catholic Church respectively. The logo depicts also the Coats of Arms of the two Churches.\n\nThe surrounding engraving denotes the visit itself – “Pope Francis Armenia June 24-26, 2016” and the motto “Visit to the First Christian State.”\n\nArmenian Catholics Hail the Papal Visit\n\nThe spiritual leaders of Armenia’s Roman Catholic community hailed on Thursday Pope Francis’s upcoming visit to the country as a recognition of and strong support for its Christian heritage. Radio Free Europe reports.\n\nPope Francis is scheduled to arrive in Armenia on June 24 on a three-day trip that will underscore the Vatican’s growing links with the Armenian Apostolic Church. He will visit the Armenian genocide memorial in Yerevan, attend an ecumenical service in the Armenian capital’s central square and hold an open-air mass in Gyumri.\n\nArmenia is home to tens of thousands of Catholics following traditional Armenian religious rites. They are concentrated in the northwestern Shirak province, of which Gyumri is the capital. Thousands of other Armenian Catholics live in Georgia’s Javakheti province bordering Shirak.\n\nArchbishop Rafael Minasian, the head of the Armenian Catholic Church in Armenia, Georgia and Eastern Europe, said his community is looking forward to the papal trip.\n\n“We, the Armenian people, have proudly kept our Christian identify for many centuries,” he said in remarks posted on the church’s website. “Over the centuries this identity has resulted in millions of martyrs who sacrificed themselves for Christ.”\n\n“As head of the Catholic Church, the Pope is obviously looking to appreciate our Christian testimony. We are honored to see such a tribute to our nation and our martyrs,” added Minasian.\n\nIn Minasian’s words, Armenia’s Catholic clergy also views the trip as an opportunity to personally thank Francis for publicly recognizing the 1915 Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey.\n\nThe pontiff described the slaughter of some 1.5 million Armenians as “the first genocide of the 20th century” during an April 2015 mass at the Vatican’s St. Peter’s Basilica dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the tragedy. Turkey recalled its ambassador to the Vatican in protest.\n\nFather Hovsep Galstian, a spokesman for the Armenian Catholic congregation, expects the Pope to also bring a “message of peace to the region” following the recent escalation of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. He noted that Pope Francis will visit Azerbaijan later this year.\n\nAnother Gyumri-based Catholic priest, Father Grigor Mkrtchian, stressed the importance of the Pope’s decision to visit Armenia’s second largest city and hold a mass there. He said the decision is related to not only Gyumri’s status as the center of Armenia’s Catholics but also the city’s grave socioeconomic problems.\n\n“As a poor-friendly Pope, he decided to come here and stand with the people of this poor region,” Mkrtchian told RFE/RL’s Armenian service (Azatutyun.am). He expressed hope that the resulting international media spotlight will serve as a catalyst for economic betterment in the poverty-stricken city.\n\nMkrtchian also predicted that at least 20,000 people will attend the Papal mass in Gyumri’s central square slated for April 25. He said they will be joined by more than 3,000 Catholic pilgrims from abroad."
