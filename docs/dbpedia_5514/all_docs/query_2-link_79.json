The price of this subordination is very high, as the March 2008 events reveal: it is the weak­ ness, and not the strength, of the Armenian state; it lacks instruments and institutions to mediate between the various sectors of the political elite and society, leaving violence in the streets as the remaining option to settle differences. Here we come to what is likely to be Armenia's biggest challenge—the one Kocharian failed to meet: after a decade and a half of independence, the Armen­ ian people do not feel that they are the owners of the state, citizens of the country; instead, they feel they are the subjects of a foreign power. This feeling of alien­ ation from the state, which has been rooted in the pub­ lic psyche after repetitive disillusionments, will be the most difficult legacy to overcome after the decade of Kocharian rule. ■ THREE PROVINCES IN ARMENIA AGBl - November 2008 19 BY GAYANE ABRAHAMYAN A 19th-century mansion, from the time when Alexandropol dozens of major agencies.

A bright apartment is still a dream for the remain­ ing 4,080 families in Gyumri, who have spent 20 years in houses that have not become homes. Their delivery of \\\"luck\\\" needs three more years, if authorities are true to their promise. \\\"The problem of homelessness in the disaster zone will finally be solved by 2013,\\\" promised Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian in Gyumri on June 12. A new ambitious government housing program will cost about 90 billion drams ($300 million dollars). \\\"We affirm the state takes the full responsibility to provide apartments to about 7,000 families [in all zones lit by the quake],\\\" Sarkisian said. \\\"We will build about 3,000 apartments in Gyumri to fully solve the homeless­ ness problem here. We need to build districts comfort­ able for life.\\\" Many locals living in \\\"temporary\\\" houses say they have heard scores of such promises but are still in old, damp houses where rodents are frequent guests. In 2001, the head of disaster zone issues at the Min­ istry of Urban Planning Vladimir Sardarian said: \\\"The construction of health-care institutions and schools in the disaster zone will be finished by the end of 2001. The housing program is planned to be finished in 2003.\\\" The promise, though, lasted hardly longer than his words ;• -- . • - v .v * ,*. r and seven years later remains unrealized. \\\"Let's hope everything will be true this time,\\\" says Narine Kurghinian, who has tolerat­ ed 20 years in a temporary house. \\\"Much has been done in the last five-six years, that's true. Schools have been built, but there are still (thou­ sands) living in these rotten houses and it is very hard to inspire them with hope.\\\" Vardan Ghukasian, mayor of Gyumri since 1999, also says housing is the problem in most urgent need of solution in the town. \\\"You can't find a family that hasn't suf­ fered some sort of illness while living in tempo­ rary houses. Housing, along with the creation of new jobs, is the primary objective we pursue,\\\" says Ghukasian, although stressing that spiritual issues should not be forgotten when solving social problems.
