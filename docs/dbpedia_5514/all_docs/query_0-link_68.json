        "text": "There are a lot of scientific and research reports dedicated to Armenian architecture from the ancient times to nowadays. There are many interesting and thoroughly researched reports of architectural and historical value done by not only Armenian but also foreign historians, architects, and engineers. Exploring Armenian architecture's chronology and research reports, we noticed that after independence of the Republic of Armenia (since 1991) there are few scientific reports which include the stages of development of architecture of newly independent Armenia, the current state of the architectural heritage and their observance. So we decided to study that period trying to show the problems and essential events as well as to introduce that period by the stages of development also including some examples of architectural heritage.\n\nThis research focuses on medieval architectures in the Armenian region of Vayots Dzor. The research mission is carried out since 2014 by the University of Florence, School of Architecture. In this paper, we show the results of a part of this research focusing on ancient buildings in the cities of Areni, Noravank and Yegheghis. We propose a series of unpublished cartographic elaborations showing the main flows of spreading of architectural typologies in Armenia, and then we focus on the analysis of the main religious structures of the village of Yegheghis. These analyses are based on architectural graphic elaborations to investigate the architectural Design, Space and Composition of medieval Armenian structures. The aim is to highlight the elements that define their architectural shape: the compositional rules, the structural design and the relationships between plan and elevation. Starting from the architectural analysis on religious buildings, we investigate the Armenian architect...\n\nCultural heritage enables us to have information about past civilizations that form the identity of the built environment in a residential area. While cultural heritage structures reflect the material properties and techniques of the period they belong to, the architectural styles they adopted, and the level of civilization, they express the societies they belong to and the way of life of the societies, world view, management style and religious structure. For this reason, the sustainability of cultural heritage is important for the preservation of the local identity of societies and the continuity of cultural values. However, historical buildings such as mosques, churches, monasteries, chapels, synagogues, madrasas, inns, baths and castles, which reflect the identity of different regions, were built in masonry. Masonry structures, on the other hand, are not resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes. In this context, it is aimed to examine the monastery, which consists of five churches from the Armenian churches in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. This monastery is Khıdskonk Monastery, which consists of the Churches of St. Karapet, Virgin Mary (Surp Asdvadzdzin), St. Stefanos, St. Krikor and St. Sarkis. The churches, which differ in terms of culture and architecture, are important in terms of having the first church plan typologies. The problem of the study is that the remains of four of the five churches that were built in the same region and that were recently built, and that only one church is partially preserved. Based on this problem, it is aimed to document and archive these churches, which are important for the Kars region, and to examine their plan typologies. In this context, the relationship between earthquake damage and typologies was investigated and evaluations were made for the churches surveyed in the sample area. As a result, by emphasizing the importance of cities for their identities, suggestions were made for the protection of cultural heritage.\n\nThe design features of the new buildings to be designed in historical cities are discussed in detail nowadays, and various rules are tried to be determined. It is tried to answer questions such as whether the new building should be designed in an old city, it should resemble the old one, how much should it be similar, should it reflect the characteristics of the age. The main reason for the controversy of the issue is the concern about the damage of historical cities concerning protecting historical cities. Especially with the concept of tangible cultural heritage and the development of the idea that this heritage is a common heritage of all cultures, it has become a matter of making joint decisions together regarding new structures to be designed in historical cities. Especially with the development of the idea that imitation of historical buildings is perceived as a disrespect to history, it has become essential to determine the limits of designing the new building with modern features without harming the historical environment. This study aims to determine these limits and to create a guideline for the determined limits and for various detailed arrangements.\n\nUnderstanding about conservation is limited to ‘monument’ or ‘old work of art’ in the past compared with today’s new concepts like ‘historical and cultural heritage’, ‘heritage of modern architecture’ and ‘heritage of industry’. Turkey’s 20th century modern architecture was started with the early modernism buildings constructed all over Turkey, especially in Ankara and İstanbul in the first years of the Republic. This period includes all the works of architecture that were produced until the late 1980s, carrying the traces of modern movement, rationalist, purist, transparent, reinterpreting the traditional architectural values by means of modern material and seeking of independent form. In this study, the Mevlana Axis between Alaaddin Hill and the historical city centre and the works of architecture in the modernisation period between the early 1900s and 1980s on this axis, contribute to the city identity and handled in the context of modern architectural heritage are evaluated.
