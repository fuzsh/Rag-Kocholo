        "text": "In a public statement dated December 5, 2008, the \"Heritage Party\" has called for an immediate halt to the petition drive in the Gyumri area that seeks to oust Archbishop Mikayel Ajapahyan as Primate of the Shirak Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The statement notes the serious concerns that the \"Heritage Party\" has over recent events in Gyumri and calls such attempts to slander the Archbishop Ajapahyan as an obvious attempt by local Gyumri officials to pressure the 'disobedient' high ranking Armenian clergyman. The statement also labels these actions as a violation of the separation of church and state principle as enshrined in the ROA Constitution. The statement goes on to say that such actions will only further widen the exisiting divide between the people and the regime. According to the \"Heritage Party\" the actions taking place in Gyumri are merely a continuation of the contemptible presidential and local governemnet elections process. The statement demands that Gyumri Mayor Vardan Ghukasyan immediately halt the signature drive directed against the Shirak Primate and respect the separation of church and state as embodied in Article 8.1 of the ROA Constitution.\n\nIf you found a typo you can notify us by selecting the text area and pressing CTRL+Enter"
