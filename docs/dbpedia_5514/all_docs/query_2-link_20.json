        "text": "“We want to enter the Norashen Church to light candles, that’s our right, no?” says Mikayel Davtyan, an Armenian from Tiflis. “Every Sunday we go to the Norashen courtyard, it’s a meeting place for Armenians. Why can’t we go inside and light candles?”\n\nThe Holy Mother of God Church in Norashen is one of the churches “in question”. It is presently closed while the courtyard serves as a gathering place for local Armenians. Armenians of Tiflis have accepted this development quite painfully given that a solution to the status of the Armenian Church in Georgia and the question of handing over the five Armenian churches in Tiflis to the Armenian Apostolic Diocese had been dragging on for years.\n\nThe Georgian Armenian community believes that in order to obtain a final resolution on the matter a more resolute stance must be taken regarding the Georgian authorities and demands must be made that they legalize the status of the churches and the Armenian Diocese according to international obligations that the Georgian authorities themselves have assumed. Karen Elchyan, President of the Armenian Cooperation Center of Georgia (ACCG) states that they have sent protests to the local Diocese and to Etchmiadzin criticizing their lackadaisical attitude and that they sent letters personally addressed to Catholicos Garegin II and the Georgian Cultural Minister calling for a halt to the illegal actions taking place at Norashen and to resolve the issue of the other churches.\n\nKaren Elchyan notes that, “The answer by the Vehapar can be summed up in a few words, basically that, ‘congratulations for being so active; work with your local Primate and we’ll resolve all existing problems’. The Georgian Cultural Ministry responded that the matter had to be taken to higher authorities since they couldn’t handle such a serious matter. Given that this is the second time this year that we have raised the matter of the same church and we only receive a negative follow-up by the Armenian Apostolic Church, the label of ‘provocateur’ and merely countless promises by the ROA authorities, we are resigned to wait for more concrete actions. Again, we will wait and see what transpires but at the same time we are drafting more serious lines of action.”\n\nAn Armenian from Tiflis who wished to remain anonymous lamented that, “In May when they first started to build the wall I was there. Every Sunday I go to the church courtyard. The people assembled were quite annoyed and were waiting for the Primate to say something but all he said was ‘if you need the Norashen church go and fight for it’.\n\nOur anonymous Armenian added, “How can we go and fight? We don’t have good diplomatic or spiritual leaders. And our parliamentary delegates are delegates in name only; what can we expect from them. In the end, what has changed in Georgia that they’re all so afraid. We must stubbornly put up a fight to be able to enter the church. At the end of the day will we go in or not?”\n\nShirak Torosyan, a Deputy in the Republican Party faction and President of the “Javakhk” Patriotic Union views the stance of his Tiflis Armenian colleagues as logical and believes that it stems from the system created in Georgia and that given the existing objective conditions it’s not that realistic to expect anything from it. Shirak Torosyan states, “They tried to intervene in the recent incidents, to quickly settle the matter, so that the noise doesn’t reach the ears of the international public, so that the voice of Armenians isn’t heard. This also doesn’t correspond to the interests of the more influential individuals in the Tiflis Armenian community. You either have to be a parliamentary deputy or not.”\n\nVan Baybourtyan, an advisor to the Georgian president and Vice President of the Armenian Union of Georgia, informed the “GHN” news service that he had already witnessed, for the fourth time, the promise of Georgian clergyman Father Tariel to get the agreement of the Georgian Armenian Diocese before conducting any of his initiatives. After all this, Van Baybourtyan is still convinced that Father Tariel is solely conducting improvement work. “Father Tariel has declared that he works for the well-being of the church and that he actually merely improving the flower bushes in the Norashen courtyard and repairing the fence near the western entrance.” stated Mr. Baybourtyan stressing that Father Tariel voluntarily placed a symbol unique to the Georgian Church on the fence. “Father Tariel conducted all that work without the written consent of either the Georgian Patriarchate or the Municipality of Tbilisi.” he added.\n\nArtyom Grigoryan, the head of the Monuments Preservation Division of the ROA Ministry of Culture, states that they usually send off letters but receive no responses. On the occasion of the recent incident, the Vice Minister of Culture, who is also the President of the ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) branch in Armenia, petitioned the President of ICOMOS in Georgia. Mr. Grigoryan confirms that his office cannot intervene in the matter since it is still not clear whether the Norashen church is registered in the list of Georgian historic-cultural monuments or not. During an international conference held in Tbilisi in 2003 they attempted to carry on talks and obtain the Georgian registry of historical-cultural monuments. Despite the many promises they received that such lists would be made available, nothing ever was handed over. They haven’t yet attempted to make such a demand in writing.\n\nMr. Grigoryan states, “I can assume that it is the hidden intention to gradually erase all Armenian traces in Georgia, something that is possible if there is government intervention. It is also possible that the people do it spontaneously as well. This manifestation has deep and serious roots. We all know that Armenians had a great contribution in the creation of the city of Tiflis and this probably causes some complexes within the authorities and people of Georgia.” He confirms that the manifestation of the destruction of monuments doesn’t only take place in Georgia and that it often takes place on a political basis. Such occurrences cannot be stopped by writing one letter because if a given country has set such a policy it will be realized, sooner or later. Mr. Grigoryan is convinced that the Georgians don’t include well-known monuments in their registry because they’d have to assume responsibility for them if they did so. “We must establish relations and foster goodwill on their part and calm their fears that such things do not pose a threat and are only historical realities and the result of the coexistence of the two peoples, nothing more.” notes Mr. Grigoryan and adds that in this case nothing can be done and we can’t penalize them. In his estimation the only possible route is to pressure the Georgians via UNESCO since that country is a member of UNESCO and has accepted the “Nature and Monuments Preservation Convention”. When asked why they haven’t yet availed themselves on this route and what must be done to avoid such occurrences in the future, Mr. Grigoryan answered with apparent difficulty, “Now that is a matter of state policy and I have some trouble responding to the question. It can be initiated by the Cultural Ministry but it wouldn’t be the best way to go. We went that route over the destruction of the gravestones in the Jugha (Julfa) Armenian Cemetery, we petitioned ICOMOS and UNESCO. But the Georgian issue is somewhat different; we must get them to understand the need for goodwill. I realize that a resolution to the matter must be found but I’m not able to find the right approach, because we have a tragic situation in the case of Azerbaijan.”\n\nIt is strange that the ROA Ministry of Culture hasn’t even come up with an approximate calculation of the Armenian historical and cultural monuments in Georgia, not even in the Armenian-populated areas of Samtskhe-Javakhk. Mr. Grigoryan points out that the Armenian Architectural Research NGO deals with that matter and adds, “We have materials in our archives but we are not presently engaged in the issue.”\n\nSamvel Karapetyan – “If we can spit on the graves of our ancestors every minute then it’s a waste of time to reside on these lands”"
