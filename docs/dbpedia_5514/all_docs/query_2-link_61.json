        "text": "Yerevan, Armenia - There are mounting concerns in Armenia regarding a controversial land lease agreement in East Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter, with many fearing the issue goes well beyond just a commercial deal.\n\nIn 2021, a land leasing agreement was signed between the Armenian Patriarchate and a private company owned by a Jewish Australian investor for the area known as the Cows’ Garden.\n\nDetails of the contract were revealed only last year, causing apprehension among the Armenian community. The 99-year lease agreement encompasses 11,500 m2 and is almost 25% of the Armenian Quarter.\n\n“Our concerns escalated when we discovered that the businessman who signed the contract has connections with Israeli extremist groups,” Hagop Djernazian, an active member of the Armenian community in Jerusalem, told The New Arab.\n\n\"This is not just a hotel itself, but also a set of restaurants, cafes, and other places of entertainment. This means that the entirety of the Armenian Quarter is endangered\"\n\nThe deal was finalised without obtaining approval from the Synod, a local assembly of church officials, and the General Assembly, which is a violation of the Armenian Patriarchate’s Charter. It is one of the reasons why Armenians consider the agreement illegal.\n\nThe Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem says it sent a letter to the partner company, Xana Gardens Ltd, informing it about its intention to cancel the agreement, as well as submitting documents about its request to the Israeli courts, where the case is now pending.\n\nSince then, Armenians patrolling the area have been attacked twice by armed Israeli settlers.\n\n“If the company signed the contract legally, why did it have to start attacks and try to intimidate? Instead of coming to the Patriarchate and clarifying its rights, it begins to exert force on the community,” said Hagop Djernazian.\n\nThe symbolism of Mount Zion\n\nThe Cows' Garden is located on the historic Mount Zion, in the southwest corner of Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter. The loss of the land threatens to sever the connection between the Armenian Quarter and the Christian Quarter, thereby posing a grave risk to a continued Christian presence within the Old City.\n\nAccording to Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan, the leader of the Shirak Diocese of Mother See in Armenia, it is no secret that the “Jewish state or Jewish extremism” does not want the presence of Christians or Muslims in Jerusalem.\n\n“Mount Zion is both a pan-Christian holy place and also holy for the Jews. It is no coincidence that the national movement of the Jews is called Zionism, to gather the Jewish people around Mount Zion,” the Holy Father said in the conversation with The New Arab.\n\nThe entrance to the Church of St Mark in the Armenian Quarter of East Jerusalem's Old City. The Armenian presence in Jerusalem dates back to the 4th century. [Getty]\n\n“Mount Zion belongs to the Armenians and Armenian church for centuries. This is where the conflict comes from,” he added.\n\nThe Armenian presence in Jerusalem dates back to the 4th century when Armenian monks settled in Jerusalem after the Armenian Kingdom became the first to adopt Christianity as a state religion.\n\nAs Archbishop Ajapahyan explained, Mount Zion is a symbol of God’s coming and God's presence on Earth, and encroachment on Christian territories is very dangerous.\n\n“We tremble for every centimetre of Armenian land because each of them is extremely precious to us,\" the Holy Father added.\n\n\"In 2021, a land leasing agreement was signed between the Armenian Patriarchate and a private company owned by a Jewish Australian investor for the area known as the Cows' Garden\"\n\nShady transaction policy\n\nThe leasing agreement of the Cows’ Garden is similar to scandals that have mired the Greek Orthodox Church, which has sold church property in Jerusalem to anonymous investors, later identified as Israeli and Jewish businessmen, using front companies.\n\nMiddle East expert Armen Petrosyan describes these kinds of transactions as an attempt by the Israeli state to strengthen its position in East Jerusalem.\n\n“After Jerusalem was completely occupied by Israel in 1967, continuous attempts were made by the State of Israel and various pan-Jewish organisations to create Jewish structures in the form of hotels, stores, especially in the area of Christian and Muslim sanctuaries,” Petrosyan said in an interview with The New Arab.\n\nInvestigations\n\nAnas Ambri\n\nAs the expert noted, various shady and corrupt transactions are carried out through individuals to establish a documented Jewish presence in East Jerusalem.\n\n“This policy is not directly executed by the state but is rather under its patronage, implemented with the involvement of private actors. The state operates behind the scenes but naturally demonstrates comprehensive and institutional support for such transactions,” added Petrosyan. Although it is a lease agreement, he sees it as obvious that if the land is yielded it will not be returned to Armenians.\n\nThe expert believes that the timing is not coincidental either. “Due to the war in Gaza, nationalistic sentiments are dominant in Israel, facilitating a united position against other nations,” he said.\n\nUniting Armenian efforts\n\nOn 8 December 2023, the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem, Nourhan Manougian, met with members of the Armenian community and explained that the deal took place without his full knowledge and that he was deceived by a local priest who worked for him, who has now been defrocked.\n\nHe promised to do everything in his power to reach a full cancellation of the deal.\n\nThe Armenian community of Jerusalem is now being supported by a group of Armenian lawyers working collaboratively with the Centre for Law and Justice ‘Tatoyan’ foundation, which has offices in Yerevan and California.\n\n\"After Jerusalem was completely occupied by Israel in 1967, continuous attempts were made by the State of Israel and various pan-Jewish organisations to create Jewish structures in the form of hotels, stores, especially in the area of Christian and Muslim sanctuaries\"\n\nIn a conversation with The New Arab, Arman Tatoyan, the director of the foundation, emphasised that the contract contradicts the interests of both the Armenian community and the Patriarchate.\n\n“We had the chance to collect detailed facts about the planned hotel and I have to say that this is not just a hotel itself, but also a set of restaurants, cafes, and other places of entertainment. This means that the entirety of the Armenian Quarter is endangered,” he said, stressing that the execution of the project will result in the eviction of a number of Armenian families.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, members of the Armenian community in Jerusalem, who he says now serve as guardians of the territory, are doing all they can to protect their interests and the interests of the Armenian Quarter.\n\nThe last time Armenians were attacked was on 28 December 2023, when dozens of armed men entered the territory of the Cows’ Garden, resulting in the injury of clergymen from the Patriarchate and members of the local Armenian community. According to witnesses, the police arrived 20 minutes later, which some people saw as intentional․\n\nAfter the attack, the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, the governing body of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Armenia, expressed concern about “the ongoing provocative actions around the Cows’ Garden area belonging to the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem”.\n\n“It is obvious that the provocateurs are once again trying to seize the Cows’ Garden area through terror, threats, and force, violating the procedures defined by the law,” the Holy See stated in a news release, expressing hope that “Israeli authorities will legally respond to the criminal actions” and exclude the repetition of similar cases.\n\n“The recent attacks that the whole world could witness were organised. These armed individuals with masks came to impose violence and terrorise people. As lawyers we qualify this as existential danger,” said Arman Tatoyan.\n\nHe also stressed that Armenian cultural heritage in the Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem is an integral part of Armenian identity. “This is pan-Armenian and that is why the state of Armenia should express its reaction to the situation.”\n\nIn response to The New Arab’s written request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia stated that they closely follow the developments in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. “The RA MFA has always been in favour of combining international efforts aimed at preserving the status quo in Jerusalem for decades.”\n\nArmenian lawyers working on the case maintain constant contact with the Armenian community of Jerusalem and cooperate with all parties involved. They hope that the issue can be solved after the letter of the Patriarch, which detailed its intention to cancel the contract, but if not, they are ready to use international means.\n\n“The only solution for us is a complete cancellation of the contract,” said Hagop Djernazian, stressing that they will continue their struggle until justice prevails.\n\nGaiane Yenokian is a journalist and photographer based in Yerevan, Armenia.

In the battle for Jerusalem, many in the Armenian community are adamant about defending and keeping the property out of the settlers’ grip.\n\nA questionable real estate transaction in one of Jerusalem’s most sensitive areas between Armenian Patriarch Nourhan Manougian and Australian-Israeli settler Dany Rubenstein is testing the resolve of the local Armenian community, which opposes the deal. In an occupied city where Jewish settlers are constantly seeking to upset a delicate status quo in their favor for political and ideological reasons, demographics and real-estate ownership are intensely political issues. As such, the sale of such property to the hands of settlers is causing an embarrassment to one of Jerusalem’s oldest Christian communities and stokes tensions with Palestinians.\n\nFor months, Hagop Dejernazian and fellow Jerusalemite-Armenians have been rallying their community in the Armenian Quarter in occupied East Jerusalem to stand firm in the face of Israeli settlers and their agents. At stake are 11.5 dunams (2.8 Acres) of precious land on the Western edge of Jerusalem’s Old City that have been in the possession of the community for centuries. Above the uncertainty the deal brought to their lives, they have endured at least three violent attacks from thugs hired by an investment company with settler ties, with the objective of intimidating them into relinquishing control of the property.\n\n“It was a brutal attack against the Armenian community that endangered our presence here,” Dejernazian remarked on the latest raid on December 28, 2023, by some 30 men bursting into the property armed with batons, assailing members of the community, including priests, seeking to eject them.\n\nIn October of last year, amid the uproar, the Patriarchate canceled the deal it had signed with Dany Rubenstein, and the matter was referred to the courts.\n\nTwo fights\n\nThe real-estate transaction estranged the local Jerusalemite Armenian community from the Patriarchate, which is mainly run by clergy of Armenian descent from abroad and largely indifferent to the political considerations or implications accompanying such a deal.\n\nNow, Dejernazian and his fellow local Armenians are in a situation where they have to defend the character of the community under threat from messianic settlers, all while without the clear backing of a Patriarchate that has lost respect.\n\nThe rift between the locals and the Patriarchate grew more evident when the latter challenged the deal with Rubenstein without considering the community’s views.\n\n“They excluded the community,” Dejernazian stated.\n\n“I think they’re still not ready to accept that the community is stronger than them. The community will decide its future and not a priest who comes from abroad who doesn’t know anything about the situation or politics in Jerusalem, or about the Middle East,” he added.\n\nThe worry, local Armenians say, is that the Patriarchate will eventually compromise with the settlers and agree to lease part of the property. This would be disastrous to the local Armenian community.\n\nTwo contracts\n\nIn 2020, the Patriarchate leased part of the property to the Israeli-run Jerusalem municipality to be used as a parking lot purportedly “for Jews and Armenians.” The Municipality was granted a 10-year lease.\n\nThe Patriarchate first agreed to a long-term 99-year lease to Rubenstein (representing Xana Gardens) in July 2021, with the partial consent or knowledge of the synod, reportedly to develop a luxury hotel on the property. The deal signed between the Patriarchate and Dany Rubinstein purportedly encompasses a vast tract of land currently used as a parking lot, a seminary, and five residential homes.\n\nThe contract, according to an article published in The Armenian Mirror Spectator in September 2021, was approved by Patriarch Nourhan Manougian, Grand Sacristan Sevan Gharibian, and Fr. Yeretzian.\n\nSometime after, new information came to light. Dany Rubenstein has a partner named Geroge Warwar, an Arab Christian man thought to be from Jaffa.\n\nIn October 2023, following growing discontent from the local Armenian community and members of the diaspora opposing the deal with Dany Rubinstein, the Patriarchate announced that it had pulled back from the agreement signed with Xana Gardens.\n\nSettler connections\n\nOn November 5 of last year, armed settlers stormed the parking lot known as the Cow’s Garden in the Armenian Quarter, knocked down parts of a stone wall and partially destroyed asphalt ground. The stone wall is roughly in the middle of the land, separating the part leased to the Municipality for a parking lot and the Armenian Patriarchate’s private parking lot, which is said to be outside the deal. Local Armenians quickly organized, repelling the assailants. Dany Rubenstein and partner George Warwar’s thugs returned in mid-November and then again in late December. On both occasions, they were repulsed.\n\nAn investigation by The New Arab revealed that among the armed assailants was an American Jewish settler with links to Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s Minister of National Security.\n\nAnother U.S. citizen, Sam Goodman, aka Tzvi Goodman, was also identified in the investigation. Goodman is linked to current Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Aryeh King, who is infamous for his pro-settler agenda. They both have a history of involvement in the eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem to achieve a Jewish majority there.\n\nAn unsourced photo that surfaced late last year showed Dany Rubenstein and George Warwar meeting with Matityahu Dan and Australian-born Daniel Luria, both from Ateret Cohanim, the same settler organization that purchased key properties, The Imperial Hotel and The Petra Hotel, in Jaffa Gate two decades ago from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. The hotels are only a minute’s walk from the Armenian Quarter and the land in question.\n\n“We are fighting for our future”\n\nLocals are now planning to file their own lawsuit against the transaction that transpired between the Patriarchate and Xana Gardens.\n\nThe outcry over the deal led them to contemplate taking matters of the community, including the property administered by the Patriarchate, into their own hands. They reason that an institution that enters a deal with political consequences and endangers the status and standing of the community warrants a new modus operandi.\n\n“I don’t trust them; I don’t trust an institution that brought us to this day, that brought us to this catastrophe,” Dejernazian said.\n\nArmenian presence in Jerusalem dates back over a millennium and a half ago. Historical records tell that Armenia became the first nation to formally adopt Christianity in 301 AD—more than a decade before Rome. Subsequently, Armenian pilgrims began journeying to Jerusalem, with some remaining to establish a permanent community.\n\n“Jerusalem is my country, more than Armenia,” George Hintilian told Mondoweiss us as he sat in the spacious tent the community erected in the parking lot to keep a steady day-and-night watch against potential settler attacks.\n\n“In many ways, we are Palestinian,” he added.\n\nHintilian, an expert historian of Armenian affairs and a central figure in the Armenian community in Old Jerusalem, reaffirms that the Armenian presence in Jerusalem is 16 centuries old.\n\nHis ancestors arrived in Palestine from Konya and Cappadocia in Ottoman Turkey during the First World War, seeking refuge from persecution by the authorities.\n\nFor the septuagenarian chronicler, Jerusalem is a mosaic of cultures and religions, of which he speaks fondly, and this deal stands to make it homogenous and exclusive to one group.\n\nSumming up the turn of events, he remarked that a “careless” Patriarch “signed away” a piece of “precious heritage” in an “unnecessary” deal.\n\n“I’m very angry and sad,” Hintilian said. “We are fighting for our future.”\n\nIsrael has long sought to acquire Church property, specifically in Jerusalem. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which is said to be the second-largest owner of real estate in the city but claims inadequate cash flow to pay salaries and for the upkeep of its monasteries, has long been mired by allegations of leaking valuable property into the hands of the government and settler organizations. It, too, has earned the distrust and dismay of many Palestinian Christians who accuse it of corruption.\n\nThe Knesset, for instance, is one of many state buildings constructed on land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\nhttps://mondoweiss.net/2024/01/the-battle-for-jerusalem-plays-out-in-the-armenian-quarter/\n\nInside the scheme to grab ‘holy’ land in Jerusalem’s Armenian quarter\n\nLocal activists are working to stop a mega-deal signed by the Armenian patriarch to lease land to a luxury hotel developer.\n\nJERUSALEM — Jewish settlers, a shady Australian developer and a defrocked priest. This unlikely cast sits at the heart of a multimillion-dollar real estate deal that has caused an uproar within Jerusalem’s ancient Armenian community and mobilized its youth in an unprecedented campaign to defend their land.\n\nThe legal case to sink the deal, which would see a long-coveted chunk of the Armenian quarter of Jerusalem fall into suspect hands, is inspiring Christian and Muslim Jerusalemites as they face down Messianic Jews bent on eradicating their presence in the bitterly contested city, now through dubious real estate deals. Armenian resistance to that long-running effort has spurred repeated attacks by masked thugs hired to intimidate the activists and revived gripes from the community about the conduct of the Armenian church, all of which has caught the attention of diverse foreign governments amid the conflict in Gaza.\n\nA dwindling population of around 1,500 Armenians lives in the quarter that is wedged between the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall, making it a prime target for Jewish acquisition. Like other non-Jews in the city, they face assaults from Jewish extremists who, emboldened by the current far-right coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu, rough up and spit at their priests and deface their buildings.\n\n“This is a battle for our very existence. A battle for the future of Jerusalem. It’s a battle to maintain its identity as a city of peace, a city of justice, of security and freedom of worship for all,” said Setrag Balian, founding member of a communal advocacy group called Save the ArQ.\n\n“If God himself asked me to sell this land, I would not,” Balian told Al-Monitor.\n\nSetrag Balian, co-founder of Save the ArQ, during an interview in Cows' Garden, East Jerusalem, May 22, 2024. (Amberin Zaman/Al-Monitor)\n\nBalian hails from a storied family of well-known ceramicists whose tiles adorn historical buildings and homes of the wealthy and famous across the world. They came to Jerusalem from Kutahya, fleeing persecution in the Turkish province where they first honed their skills.\n\nThe bespectacled 27-year-old exudes a gravitas that is coupled surprisingly well with his man bun. We are “walking a very tight rope” he says, so as to ensure that the issue remains “a Christian Armenian one within the context of Jerusalem.” Yet the dispute's ramifications are being felt beyond Israel’s borders in Armenia proper, where a succession of Turkish- and Israeli-backed attacks by Azerbaijan resulted in the loss of large swathes of land.\n\nCows’ Garden or cash cow?\n\nThe 98-year-long lease agreement to construct a luxury hotel was signed on July 7, 2021, between the Armenian Patriarchate and an obscure Jewish Australian investor, Danny Rothman, who also calls himself Danny Rubinstein. It encompasses a vast and rare expanse of open space located in the Armenian quarter known as Cows’ Garden, named after the bovines that grazed there until the 19th century. Survivors of the 1915 genocide of the Armenians, including some 20,000 orphans whose wizened faces stare out from panels erected in their memory at the recently refurbished Armenian Museum, took shelter there after months of grueling travel through the deserts of Arabia. “It’s a holy place,” explained George Hintlian, a historian who has dedicated his life to researching and preserving his native Armenian heritage in Jerusalem and beyond. “There were many offers made before. We turned all of them down.”\n\nAn image of Armenians orphaned by the genocide at the Armenian Museum in East Jerusalem, May 24, 2024. (Amberin Zaman/Al-Monitor)\n\nCows’ Garden is currently used as a parking lot by local residents. It’s “a lifeline” for parents who bring their children to the pair of Armenian schools in the quarter, Hintlian noted. Rothman’s complex would gobble up not only Cows’ Garden but the homes of five Armenian families, parts of the Armenian Patriarch’s private parking space and garden and a wing of the Armenian seminary where the 1915 genocide of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks is commemorated every year.\n\nIt’s a bum deal. The Patriarchate is to be paid a measly $300,000 annually for one of the choicest pieces of property in all of Jerusalem. The building scheme covers roughly 25% of the Armenian quarter and sits atop the highest point on Mount Zion, an oasis of calm encircled by thick stone walls built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the second Ottoman ruler of Jerusalem, in the mid-16th century.\n\nMany believe that Rothman is a front man for Jewish settler groups. Haaretz, the liberal Israeli daily newspaper, published a photograph showing Rothman at a Jerusalem hotel posing alongside Mati Dan, the founder of Ateret Cohanim, a group that promotes and funds Jewish settlements in and around the old city. There is no actionable evidence of any business ties between the two, and Dan has denied any links to the pending development, yet it’s “entirely conceivable” that settlers are behind the scheme, according to Laura Wharton, an elected member of the Jerusalem City Council who mediates between local communities and the mayor, Moshe Lion.\n\n“There is a fringe group within the city and the country and beyond who want only Jews, religious and not secular ones, to fill Jerusalem. Many are trying to buy up land in East Jerusalem, which allows them to skirt charges of outright dispossession, and [israeli Minister of National Security] Itamar Ben-Gvir has a record of supporting them,” Wharton told Al-Monitor. She was alluding to the far-right politician’s overt support in 2022, when he was a lawmaker, for the eviction of a Palestinian family from Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.\n\nSuspicions of links between Rothman and the settlers deepened when a group of them, armed with rifles and attack dogs, moved against a peaceful sit-in staged by Save the ArQ in Cows’ Garden on the night of November 4, demanding they “get out of our land.” Rothman was present and caught on camera with one of the assailants, Saadia Hershkop, a notorious extremist with alleged ties to violent criminals. The standoff continued into the next day. Police were forced to intervene.\n\n“That is when the reality of what we were up against fully hit us,” said Hagop Djernazian, who, with Balian, is at the forefront of the campaign to reverse the deal. The 24-year-old political science major is a descendant of Armenian genocide survivors from Turkey’s Kahramanmaras province. Service to the community is in his DNA — Djernazian’s grandpa chauffeured successive Patriarchs until the mid-1990s. “We are trying to marry the boldness of youth with the wisdom and experience of our elders,” Djernazian said of the campaign to rescue Cows’ Garden. The US-based Center for Law and Justice \"Tatoyan\" Foundation that is aiding the legal team has raised more than $113,000 to help cover legal fees so far.\n\n'The fish stinks from its head'\n\nThe community first caught wind of the transaction in October 2021, after an Armenian publication, Keghart, reported that 12 priests belonging to the Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, also known as the Saint James Brotherhood, had signed a joint statement denouncing the deal. It was followed by another statement signed by 17 priests, asserting that the agreement had been concluded without the consent of the Holy Synod and the General Assembly and that Patriarch Nourhan Manougian and his two lieutenants who inked it lacked the authority to act on their own.\n\nIt was not until April 2023, though, that the full contours of the deal became known. Faced with public outrage, Manougian declared that he was not in command of its details — he had not even seen a map. He had been misled, he claimed, by his real estate advisor, Father Barets Yeretsian, who was a co-signer. The denial was met with disbelief. “The fish stinks from its head,” snorted Hoppig Jordan, a local entrepreneur, as she stirred a yogurt marinade for a shawarma she was preparing at the Armenian General Benevolent Union. Tucked away in a narrow alley, the social club is for families thought to have descended from Jerusalem’s original Armenian population who came to the city in the fourth century. “Are you telling me the Patriarch doesn’t know what was in that contract?” Jordan asked. “One hundred percent he does. I told him to take off his habit and to leave,” Jordan told Al-Monitor. “In the old days, we had guys with balls. Now we have this.”\n\nHer disdain, if not aired as bluntly, is shared by many in the community who question the Patriarchate’s recent maneuvers to terminate protected tenancy agreements — ostensibly for financial profit — at residents’ expense. Nir Hasson, a Haaretz reporter who covers minority affairs in depth, told Al-Monitor, “There is no way this deal could work without some corruption.” The Patriarch and his team “were at a minimum stupid and utterly responsible,” Hasson added.\n\nAn unfazed Manougian has maintained the line that Yeretsian was the sole culprit, even as he continues to refuse to provide information about his dealings with Rothman and his company, Xana Gardens. Yeretsian was defrocked on May 5. Asserting his innocence, the “fall guy” fled to California, but not before angry protestors besieged Yeretsian’s home to ensure that he did not take incriminating documents with him.\n\nThe affair took a further dramatic turn that month when Jordan and the Palestinian Authority announced in a joint statement they had withdrawn their recognition of Manougian as Patriarch on the grounds that he “mishandl[ed] culturally and historically significant Christian properties” in the Armenian quarter of East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem is considered the official capital of Palestine by numerous countries and was under Jordanian control until Israel occupied it following the 1967 Six-Day War. In a 1994 treaty signed between Jordan and Israel, the latter agreed to recognize the former’s “special role” over Muslim Holy sites in the city.\n\nCrowds began gathering regularly under Manougian’s window, chanting “traitor” and demanding that he come clean. In October, likely fearing for his seat, Manougian caved. The Patriarchate announced that it was pulling out of the “fraudulent and deceitful deal” and pressed charges against Rothman and George Warwar, his Arab Christian business partner with a criminal record, of “misrepresenting” themselves and their intentions. The move triggered the first attack by Rothman’s thugs for hire who showed up with bulldozers and demolished a wall.\n\nLed by Save the ArQ, community members, working in shifts, have since been guarding the site.\n\nIn a third incident on Nov. 15, “instead of removing the trespassers, Israeli police permitted a few settlers to continue their presence intended to possess the Armenian property,” Save the ArQ said in a press release shared on its X account, a virtual archive of the unfolding saga.\n\n“The Israeli police in Jerusalem have a consistent record of turning a blind eye to Jewish nationalistic violence. We have witnessed Palestinians being attacked and police joining in,” Aviv Tatarsky, a Jewish activist who advocates on behalf of Eastern Jerusalem’s Palestinians and other threatened communities, said. “They have the state and Israeli law on their side. And the Armenians are especially vulnerable, as they are a minority within a minority,” Tatarsky told Al-Monitor.\n\nThat said, the Armenians have “a positive image” among Israelis, Wharton, the city councilor, observed. “Most Israelis see Christians as being more friendly to the Jews than Muslims are. Besides, anyone with any historical understanding knows that the Armenians have been in Jerusalem for a very long time,” she added.\n\nStill, unlike numerous governments and historians of global repute, Israel refuses to label the mass killings from 1915 onward of more than one million Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces as a genocide. Israel’s reluctance stems in part from a desire to not provoke Turkey, even as its ties with Ankara have plummeted to new lows over the conflict in Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s military support for Azerbaijan has sharpened Armenian feelings of besiegement. The state of mind is palpable in Cows' Garden. Armenian flags line the makeshift perimeter fence set up by community members to keep Xana Gardens out. Inside the encampment stands a “mountain” composed of loose rocks, discarded latrines and rusting metal. Above it flies the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, the mountainous enclave that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan and which Armenians call Artsakh. It was seized by Azerbaijan forces last year and ethnically cleansed of its majority Armenian population in less than two weeks.\n\n“This is our Leletepe,” said Balian, gesturing toward the mound. He was referring to a strategic hilltop in Nagorno-Karabakh where the Azerbaijani military in 2016 committed atrocities against Armenian civilians, rights groups say.\n\nProstitutes and pills\n\nOn Feb. 18, after months of stonewalling by the Patriarchate, the Armenian community filed its own case in the Jerusalem District Court to nullify the Cows’ Garden lease. Precedent suggests that the case could drag on for years.\n\nIn 2005, it emerged that the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem had sealed a similarly opaque deal. Unbeknownst to his flock, the Patriarch had ceded two hotel buildings desirably situated at the entrance of Jaffa Gate at far below their true value to Ateret Cohanim. Haaretz’s Hasson recently unearthed tape recordings documenting how the settler group’s leader, Mati Dan, engaged the services of prostitutes, “as long as they are not Jewish,” and doled out sorryyyyy pills to lure East Jerusalemites to sell their land. The Patriarch was sacked and the Patriarchate went to court. After a nearly 20-year-long fight, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Ateret Cohanim was legally entitled to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate’s land.\n\nSami Ershied, a Palestinian Muslim lawyer who is acting on behalf of the Armenians, asserts that their case is different.\n\nFor one, the prosecution’s case rests on the very same arguments listed in the statements signed by the brothers of Saint James, namely that the Patriarchate does not own the land and hence lacks the authority to conclude such deals. The prosecution has evidence to prove it.\n\n“According to the ownership documents that we found and submitted to court, this land belongs to the Armenian community in Jerusalem,” Ershied said. The document was issued by an Ottoman Sharia court more than 450 years ago and proves that the land was “bequeathed” to the Armenian community of Jerusalem when the Ottomans were at their apex and felt secure.\n\n“Frankly speaking, I conducted a few researches and visits to the Ottoman archive in Istanbul and the Ottoman land registry in Ankara. I found that the empire was well documented and well organized despite what we were taught in history lessons,” Ershied told Al-Monitor.\n\nThis works in favor of property owners, on all sides. Jewish settlers have used Waqf documents to establish ownership over disputed properties in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan. Israeli courts have recognized their legitimacy, and as such, the Armenian community is hopeful that it will prevail.\n\nIn the meantime, the Patriarchate still refuses to cooperate. “They have refused to share anything with us from the beginning and refused to meet with the community members and the legal team after submitting our case,” Ershied lamented. “People in power don’t want to be held accountable.”\n\nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/inside-scheme-grab-holy-land-jerusalems-armenian-quarter"
