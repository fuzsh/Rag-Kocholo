Population counts (pop.) are estimates for 7 km radius from place and due to ongoing migrations the numbers are not exact. INTRODUCTION For most first-time visitors Kotaik (also spelled “Kotayk”) is simply a blur on the highway on the way to the beaches of Lake Sevan or the ski slopes at Tsaghkadzor. This is a pity, since the <strong>marz</strong> offers an amazing variety of monuments and natural splendors, and if they lie mostly on the edges of the district, well then they are all the more worth the effort. Kotaik is a glory of history and nature, tracing Armenia’s development from Stone Age settlements in the Hrazdan River Gorge, which snakes north and south through the region like a craggy spine, to 15,000-5000 BCE petroglyphs etched on the rocks of the Geghama Lehr (Mountain Range), to the settlements of the Armenian Arshakuni Dynasty, at the cliff top 2 nd c Greco-Roman temple at Garni and its entrance to the great Khosrov Nature Preserve, to the dozens of Medieval sites throughout the <strong>marz</strong>, including the great monasteries at Bjni, Buzhakan, Tsaghkadzor, Kaputan and the stunning complex at Geghard, itself carved from solid rock and built to house the true spear that pierced Christ’s flesh. Throughout the <strong>marz</strong> are undulating mountain meadows teeming with spring wildflowers and forests lining the western crests of the Tegheniats Range, towering above the mineral spas, summer resorts and camps at Arzakan, Hankavan and Arzni, while the Geghama Range harbors both 15,000 BCE petroglyphs and several of Armenia’s rare natural lakes, fed by melting snows. Not one to show its charms lightly, Kotaik makes you work for your pleasures, whether they are on top of the Geghama Lehr or hiking through the forests on its western border. Since most visit Armenia in the heat of summer, the sun blasted landscape can be intimidating, like those in Armavir and Ararat <strong>marz</strong>es, but a little Highlights • Visit Garni, Armenia’s Residence of Kings, with its Greek Temple and Bronze Age Fortress (p.14) • Visit Geghard Monastery, built to house the True Spear and carved from solid rock (p.) • Explore Levon’s Divine Underground,” a subterranean labyrinth of stone carved entirely by hand.

Kotaik has more accessible pleasures as well, including the popular resort at Tsaghkadzor, packed in the winter months with avid snow skiers and their wannabes and almost as full in the summer with the newly rich who move like herds into the forested villas, resorts and hotels. Closer to Yerevan is the still thriving mineral spa at Arzni, once the private domain of the Soviet elite, but now open to all who want to wile away their time with mineral baths and massages. The road to Arzakan is filled with summer “camps”, full-service lodgings that include meals and a few mineral baths of their own. North of Tsaghkadzor is the road to Hankavan, another favorite of the Soviet vacationer, and the location of many summer camps for Armenia’s children, as well as a few well-heeled pensionats at surprisingly affordable prices. Just 15 minutes from Yerevan is the thriving community of Abovian and the nearby village of Akunk, favored by gastronomic insiders wanting to dine on fresh fish bred in one of the dozens of small ponds that permeate the area. Fed by one of the largest aquifers in Western Asia, the millions of liters of water erupting from the surrounding marshland quenches half of the capital’s thirst, while the other half gushes from the towering cliffs of Garni Gorge, also in Kotaik, its elaborate river system host to rare species of plants and fauna, as well as picnickers and swimmers seeking some respite from Yerevan’s stifling heat. NATURE 34 Kotaik’s environment is as varied as its geography, with several three main geographic zones and several sub-zones. The southernmost area, close to Yerevan, is a part of the Sub-Arax, or Ararat folded mountain region. This area is lush in the few weeks of the year when rain is plentiful, but is otherwise parched without irrigation. The upper district, beginning with the Tsaghkuniats mountains (a spur of the Pambak Mountain Range) near Tsaghkadzor and extending north to Lori and Tavush <strong>marz</strong>, is a part of the Lesser Caucasus Mountain Range, with folded mountain ridges marking its terrain. The mountains still show traces of the huge forests that once adored their hills, now reduced to a few hundred hectares near the resort areas that draw their worthiness from the tree-induced micro-climate.
