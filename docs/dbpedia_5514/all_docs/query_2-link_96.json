Each volume in the series provides immersion in an aspect of Greco-Roman culture, so as to make possible a comparison of the controlling logics that emerge from the discourses of Greco-Roman and early Christian writers. In contrast to older “history of religions” approaches, which looked for similarities between religions in order to posit relations of influence and dependency, Synkrisis embraces a fuller conception of the complexities of culture, viewing Greco-Roman religions and early Christianity as members of a comparative class. The differential comparisons promoted by Synkrisis may serve to refine and correct the theoretical and historical models employed by scholars who seek to understand and interpret the GrecoRoman world. With its allusion to the rhetorical exercises of the Greco-Roman world, the series title recognizes that the comparative enterprise is a construction of the scholar’s mind and serves the scholar’s theoretical interests.\n\nE di t or i a l B oa r d Loveday Alexander (Sheffield University) John Bodell (Brown University) Kimberly Bowes (University of Pennsylvania) Daniel Boyarin (University of California, Berkeley) Fritz Graf (Ohio State University) Ronald F.

She graciously obliged with a CD of more than two hundred archival photographs. As I went through them to select the best for a lecture on early Christian rituals, I returned again and again to the photos of female figures processing around the room. It looked like an ancient torch-lit wedding procession. What began as a class lecture became a short article; invitations to lecture on the topic followed; the article became two articles and several different public lectures. And still more remained to be said, which has now become this book. My sincere thanks go fi rst, then, to Lisa Brody and Megan Doyon at the Yale University Art Gallery, without whom my initial sparks would have had no fuel. The expansion from initial scintillae of thought to full-blown arguments depended, though, on many other gracious colleagues and patrons. Foremost among these is Robin Jensen, who welcomed me into the world of art history as if it had been my primary field all along. She encouraged me to pursue my sometimes wild ideas and helped me to know which were best to chase. Andrew McGowan and Felicity Harley-McGowan were similarly supportive over meals and emails, as were my steering committee colleagues on the Art and Religions in Antiquity group of the Society of Biblical Literature. For other acts of scholarly kindness, I acknowledge Harold Attridge, David Brakke, Stephen Davis, George Demacopoulos, Lucinda Dirven, Ben Dunning, Gail Hoffman, Blake Leyerle, Dale Martin, Candida Moss, Jeanne-Nicole Saint-Laurent, Stephen Shoemaker, Maureen Tilley, Terrence Tilley, Jennifer Udell, and Larry Welborn. I am ever grateful to Christiana Peppard, a consummate scholar and endlessly supportive partner. Arguments from this book were presented as invited lectures at Columbia University, Yale University, McGill University, and New York ix\n\nx\n\nAcknowledg ments\n\nUniversity’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, along with conferences in the United States, England, and Germany. I am grateful to all those who provided feedback along the way. Portions of chapters 1, 4, and 5 appeared previously in two published articles: “New Testament Imagery in the Earliest Christian Baptistery,” in Dura-Europos: Crossroads of Antiquity (ed. Lisa R. Brody and Gail L. Hoff man; Chestnut Hill; Chicago: McMullen Museum of Art: dist. by University of Chicago Press, 2011), 169–87; and “Illuminating the Dura-Europos Baptistery: Comparanda for the Female Figures,” Journal of Early Christian Studies 20 (2012): 543–74. The editors at Yale University Press, especially Jennifer Banks and Heather Gold, have been enthusiastic and expert in guiding the manuscript forward. Without the financial support of various entities, the research for this book would have gone on much longer than it did. Special thanks go to the Faculty Fellowship program at Fordham University and also for a generous research grant from the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation, which enabled an extra semester’s leave from teaching. With that research leave, I had originally planned to spend time in Syria. Although most of the artifacts from Dura-Europos were removed to museums decades ago, I nonetheless wanted to see the site with my own eyes and walk through the western gate of the city with my own feet. I thought I would also make a pilgrimage to the artistic remains at Mar Musa al-Habashi, the monastery refounded as a place of Muslim-Christian prayer and dialogue by Fr. Paolo Dall’Oglio, S.J., whom I had met once in the United States. I had tentative plans to work on my Aramaic and Syriac language skills at the university in Aleppo. Yet the civil war in Syria raged on. The beginning of my research leave corresponded exactly to the tragic bombings at Aleppo University ( January 15, 2013), where I had hoped to study. This book about the oldest church building in Syria was thus written under a dark cloud of despair. I read daily about tragedies both large and small throughout contemporary Syria, even as I wrote daily about its ancient beliefs and cultures. The refugee crisis in Syria and its surrounding environs has reached historic\n\nAcknowledg ments\n\nxi\n\nproportions, the increasing numbers rendering futile our attempts to grasp the burden of suffering on each individual. Even those dedicated to peace building, such as Fr. Paolo—still missing as I write this—have not escaped the war’s grasp. With solemnity, I dedicate this book to the people of Syria, the cradle of Christianity.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction: January 18, 1932, Excavation Block M8\n\nC l a r k H o p k i n s r e f l e c t e d on a momentous day in the east Syrian desert and penned in his diary: “In the fresco room in front of the tower south of the Main Gate the dirt came off one section and showed 5 people in a boat—2 standing below, one on a bed on the shore. Above, a god on a cloud.”1 Over the next three days, Hopkins and Henry Pearson, professors in Yale University’s departments of classics and fine arts, respectively, would dig, scrape, and brush away seventeen hundred years of the past. Working with their Armenian foreman, Abdul Messiah, they found that each wall of the rectangular room contained a different painting: a shepherd with a flock of sheep; a male and a female figure near a tree and a serpent. Shortly thereafter, they found the first inscriptions amid the frescoes, one of which read, “Christ, remember me, the humble Siseos.”2 Suddenly the paintings took on a stunning symbolism. That “god on a cloud” was not an image from Syrian or Roman mythology. It was one of the oldest depictions of Jesus Christ. Hopkins and Pearson had uncovered the world’s oldest extant Christian church—dating from about the year 250. As field director of the excavations at Dura-Europos, one of the most successful and revelatory archaeological efforts in the Middle East, Hopkins had become rather used to such discoveries. During several seasons of excavating the fortified city, perched on a cliff above the western bank of the Euphrates River, the teams from the United States and France were uncovering buildings, artwork, artifacts, and inscriptions at a seemingly unprecedented rate. In his letter of January 22 to Michael Rostovtzeff, professor of ancient history and classical archaeology at Yale University, 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nHopkins described how “one extraordinary discovery [has] followed another with startling rapidity.”3 But it was not always easy to know what exactly they were discovering. In the official buildings, public temples, and private dwellings, there were scenes of sacrifice to unnamed gods, paintings of birds descending toward unidentified regal figures, and processions of men and women on the feast day of—who knows? Ancient archaeology in general suffers from such unknowns. Doing ancient history is like assembling a borderless jigsaw puzzle for which we have only a small fraction of the pieces and no box lid to provide a picture. Historians work by a combination of scientific data collection and inductive analysis, but even then, occasionally a new puzzle piece emerges that seems to stand alone. Such was the case for Hopkins and Pearson, who had discovered the only extant church building from before the age of Constantine. To what should this place be compared? While some aspects of the Christian building were correctly identified at first glance, others were not. Consider this excerpt from the diary on January 20: “Pearson and I uncovered frescoes in the morning. The lower right-hand side of the room showed two men, one with a wand like a small palm tree in the right hand and a bowl in the left, the second with a stick or sword in the right, bowl at breast in the left, both advancing left toward large white building, pediment style, with a great star over each gable.”4 This particular painting (plate 1) occupied a major portion of the room that would come to be called the baptistery. It was probably the dominant feature of the church’s artistic program. But who are these men, what are they carrying, and where are they going? In the entry of February 2, Hopkins refers to the painting as the “fresco of the Three Kings,” apparently deriving his hypothesis from the starlit building to which the figures were processing.5 But a different idea was offered on March 14 by M. Henri Seyrig, the director of the Ser vice des Antiquités of Syria and Lebanon. He had come out to the site from Beirut for the partage—the division of items from that season’s campaign. This painting’s men were not men at all, he suggested. Rather, the procession depicted the women approaching the tomb of Christ to anoint his\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nbody on Easter morning.6 Hopkins was convinced. The deal for the partage was made. Syria kept most of the season’s finds, but the Yale team negotiated to keep all the frescoes from the Christian building. Seyrig soon returned to Beirut, but he had left behind a mustard seed of an idea. The identification of the processing figures in the Dura-Europos baptistery as the women approaching the tomb of Christ—though it had notable skeptics in the 1930s—would eventually come to represent the consensus view of the artistic program. Once the frescoes were taken to the United States, Seyrig’s seminal proposal branched out to support further hypotheses and theological interpretations about the meaning of the art in this ritual space. The historical assessment of early Christian initiation became partially rooted in the identification of the motif of death and resurrection at the Dura-Europos baptistery. Through the frescoes’ installation in the Yale University Art Gallery, complete with official placards and interpretations, the views on each of the surviving paintings solidified. Encyclopedia entries were written; meanings were anthologized. Who would question an encyclopedia entry or the accuracy of a placard in one of the world’s great art museums? Accordingly, the final archaeological report of 1967 seemed to be just that—final. When the humidity of New Haven, Connecticut, rendered the art materially unfit for further display, it was removed from its gallery in the late 1970s. Critical reflection on the consensus views continued to fade away. Fewer than fifty years after it was unearthed, the baptistery seemed to have been reburied. Yet questions remain. What are the women carrying in their hands? What was thought initially to be a wand, or a stick, or a sword, came to be recognized correctly as a torch. But why are these women carrying torches, when none of the Gospel texts denotes or even implies such a thing? Why do no other artistic depictions of the women at the tomb—from late antiquity to the present—portray them in this way? And to what are they processing? All initial field reports describe the white structure in the fresco as a building, and indeed it is taller than the figures of the women. So why did it come to be seen as a sarcophagus—a coffin (not) containing the corpse of Jesus on Easter morning? What are those stars hovering above the white\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nstructure? Why are the women veiled and dressed all in white? Finally, a question I ask myself: Is it really possible that some paintings from this famous site have not been identified correctly? In the pages that follow, we return once again to the murals of the third-century Christian building from Dura-Europos. In an auspicious coincidence, some of them are also back on display at the renovated Yale University Art Gallery. A lot has changed since the archaeological report of 1967: new textual sources have emerged; previously spurious patristic texts about Christian initiation are now assigned to legitimate authors; neglected artistic comparanda can be brought to the fore; and noncanonical traditions are treated with greater respect by historians of early Christianity. Methodological changes have been just as important. For example, art historians no longer look primarily for one-to-one correspondences between texts and images but think more creatively about the polyvalent modes and meanings of viewing. Textual scholars no longer presume stable traditions of transmission, nor do we reinforce a firm canonical barrier when investigating pre-Constantinian Christianity. Finally, scholars of both art and text have begun to discern how the presence of ritual in a given space affects our interpretation of surrounding materials. In other words, the meaning of what appears on these walls may become clear only when we imagine what happened between them.\n\nO n e\n\nDura-Europos and the World’s Oldest Church\n\nA Frontier Fort and Its Burial For Michael Rostovtzeff, Dura-Europos was the archaeological find of a lifetime. The charismatic Russian émigré and Yale classicist was so enamored of the endless riches being unearthed that he labeled it the “Pompeii of the Syrian desert,” ennobling it by comparison to the jaw-dropping art and architecture discovered under volcanic rock in Italy.1 In some ways, the analogy is apt: the excellent state of preservation of some of the buildings, the diversity of the finds, the famous wall paintings. But no Vesuvius buried this Pompeii. To the contrary, portions of this city—including excavation block M8, which contained the house-church—were buried intentionally. Who would have done such a thing, and why? The settlement variously called “Dura” or “Europos”—depending on which empire controlled it at any given time—had always lived on the edge.2 The medium-sized colony was founded in 303 BCE by the Seleucid dynasty, successors of Alexander the Great, as “Europos,” in order to honor the Macedonian birthplace of the dynasty’s founder, Seleucus I.3 During this Hellenistic era, it became a crucial crossroads that connected travel and trade along the Euphrates River with the cities to its west. Placed high above the western bank of the river, the settlement was unassailable from the east and thus helped to define and secure the border between regions held by various empires over the centuries. In fact, the location was so ideal that the Assyrians seem to have used it as a military outpost or fort as early as the second millennium BCE (“Dura” in Semitic languages means “fortress” or “stronghold”).4 Then around 110 BCE Parthians from 5\n\n6\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nMesopotamia gained control of the region and, by necessity, of DuraEuropos as well. Though descendants of the Hellenistic colonists retained some prominence, new waves of immigration from Palmyra to the west and Mesopotamia to the east brought linguistic and cultural change.5 Over the next two centuries, the expanding Roman Empire was often knocking on the door of Dura’s western gate.6 Finally in 165 CE, Emperor Lucius Verus took full control of the city, and the Romans held it with the help of auxiliary units from Palmyra. During its Roman era, which lasted almost one hundred years, DuraEuropos blossomed into a quintessential frontier town, exploding with a diversity of ethnicities, languages, and religions.7 The street grid was expanded, organized, and flanked by colonnades, although its overall size was by modern standards quite small—the western wall, the city’s longest edge, stretched only about 900 meters.8 Trade with Palmyra continued apace, and new building projects were undertaken. Although the Greek language retained its cultural dominance and Latin became an administrative language, the city also exhibited Hebrew, various forms of Aramaic (including Palmyrene, Syriac, and Hatrian, from eastern Mesopotamia), northern Arabic, and Iranian (including Parthian and middle Persian).9 A parchment found at the site records the payments of members of the “tribe” of a certain “Zebeinas,” which includes names that originated in five different languages.10 This document offers a rare glimpse of the names of nonelites at Dura during the Roman era, who appear to be as diverse as the other artifacts would lead us to believe.11 The religious diversity of Roman-era Dura-Europos can be seen on the recent map of the city, which shows many temples and religious buildings (plate 2).12 During any given week in the mid-third century, one could have visited buildings and shrines dedicated to the gods of Greece, Rome, Judea, Syria, and Persia. But would anyone have done so? Visited sites of multiple religions? In fact, one of the most important ways to open up modern understanding of religious practice in the ancient world is to realize its nonexclusivity. Tolerance was the rule, intolerance the exception. People frequently belonged to several different religious associations at once. The exception was to belong to one or none.\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n7\n\nDura-Europos was diverse, to be sure, but it was far from unique in having a layout such as this. Most major cities exhibited manifold religious sites. Residents of Corinth in Greece, Ephesus in Asia Minor, or a port city such as Berenike in Egypt lived quite literally in a world full of gods. The influence of gods and other superhuman beings on daily life was accepted and negotiated. One simply could not get from home to work and back again without several divine encounters. Temples and shrines and statues abounded, but on a more basic level, even to buy food for dinner, one would hand over a coin impressed with the image of a divine ruler and receive back meat from an animal sacrificed to a god. Acknowledging the power of divine forces was especially important for frequent travelers. Most travelers brought along piety to their own god or gods from home, but it would have been considered rude, arrogant, or even dangerous if one did not also offer sacrifice to the god or gods of the new location. Being a frontier town also meant that Dura-Europos was heavily militarized and targeted. The Roman era witnessed the northwest quarter of the city overtaken by the army and buildings to supply its needs. Besides the Roman soldiers stationed here, there is a well-documented record of a cohort of soldiers from Palmyra—likely including a significant unit of archers—who served alongside the Romans.13 Ample discoveries of papyri and inscriptions from the excavation attest to this mixed cohors XX Palmyrenorum near the sanctuary that archaeologists would come to call the Temple of the Palmyrene Gods. In fact, this regiment, though lasting “less than a century and stationed at a distant outpost in the easternmost end of the empire, is today the regiment for which we have the largest body of [Roman] military records of any kind, the most extensive list of personnel, the widest knowledge about (anomalous) internal organization, and about the daily employment of its soldiers.”14 Excellent examples related to cultic diversity were preserved from the militarized quarter of the city. In a painting from the pronaos (the space just in front of the entrance to a main temple area) of the Temple of the Palmyrene Gods, Julius Terentius, a Roman tribune with the Palmyrene cohort behind him and standard bearer in front of him, performs a sacrifice near the altar (fig. 1.1). But to whom? The figures on the lower left are the\n\n8\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nFig. 1.1. Julius Terentius frieze. Temple of the Palmyrene Gods. Exhibition photograph. (Yale University Art Gallery, Dura-Europos Collection)\n\nTychai, the guardian spirits, of the cities of Palmyra and Dura-Europos. Since the painting was found in a temple with images of other Palmyrene gods, are the figures in the upper left of this Roman painting particular gods from Palmyra? Or are they perhaps divine Roman emperors or members of the imperial family? It is difficult to be sure because Palmyrene deities, such as Iarhibol, became Romanized and solarized in their appearance at Dura-Europos.15 In any case, a cohort of soldiers recruited from Palmyra to join the Roman army would require allegiances both to Palmyrene gods and to the cult of the Roman imperial family.16 In that same temple was found not just a painting of an altar, but also an altar itself.17 Here a text is what generates a sense of diversity in language and ritual practice. The inscription’s language is Greek; its dedicant from the Roman army has a Latin name (written in Greek), and he is a chiliarch, a Greek word meaning “commander of one thousand men.” He dedicates\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n9\n\nthe altar to the Palmyrene god Iarhibol. But there is little doubt that this dedicant also worshipped other gods—the imperial family; probably the god Mithras, who was so popular among the soldiers; and perhaps more. In short, religious diversity at Dura-Europos was a basic fact of life, just as it was in other cosmopolitan cities of the ancient world. Evidence suggests that the Palmyrene cohort successfully integrated itself with the Roman soldiers to produce a formidable mixed garrison.18 Two other examples of the solidarity between the Palmyrenes and Romans were found in the excavation. First was the Feriale Duranum, the religious calendar of the Palmyrene cohort at Dura, which records festivals for the entire year. Lucinda Dirven observes: “Although it is a festival calendar of a foreign unit, the Feriale mentions no gods from the locality of DuraEuropos or Palmyra; it lists only army festivals, Roman gods of public festivals, the cults of the reigning emperor (divi), and imperial women . . . as such, this calendar contributed to the Romanization and unification of the army.”19 A second case of fraternity with Roman soldiers was the aforementioned devotion to Mithras, a god worshipped especially in the army through stages of ritual initiation.20 The well-preserved Mithraeum, a subterranean ritual space discovered in the military’s quarter of town, contained inscriptions in Greek and Palmyrene dedicated by generals of the archers in the early part of the Roman phase of Dura-Europos.21 Alongside this militarized part of the city stood the largest building excavated there: a sprawling complex of more than forty rooms that came to be called the Palace of the Dux Ripae. Before the discovery of Dura, the title Dux Ripae was unknown and is still not otherwise attested. This “commander of the riverbank” is called such by a dedication in one painted dipinto, and it is not certain that other mentions of officials called dux refer to one and the same Dux Ripae.22 Yet regardless of who lived and worked in this palace on the northeast corner of the city, historians can say one thing for sure: he had the city’s best view. We might imagine the Dux Ripae looking out at sunrise, through the window of nature’s high-rise penthouse. The mighty Euphrates flowed about one hundred meters below the cliff, and the north-by-northeast perspective allowed a perfect view of ships coming from upstream and an endless horizon beyond. From this vantage\n\n10\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\npoint, the city must have felt proud and invincible. But in the third century, just beyond the horizon, an opposing army was gathering—a real rival, in the word’s root meaning. Who would control the river? During the buildup of the city and the garrison in the Roman era, the Sasanid Empire arose as the rival to the east. The Sasanians had conquered the Parthians and, when commanded by Shapur I, had assumed a posture of aggression toward the Roman Empire in the mid-third century. The Roman frontier along the Euphrates had not yet experienced a largescale invasion from the east, and its cities were not prepared for the size of the Sasanian armies. ( Just how unprepared they were was recounted by later historians, who noted an attack of Shapur’s archers into the theater of Antioch while a play was still going on!)23 And yet, even such massive forces east of Dura would not have been able to attack it from the east. Set above the cliffs, Dura had the massive force of gravity on its side. From the main Palmyra Gate on the west, however, Dura-Europos was vulnerable. The Sasanians fi rst conquered regions of Syria west of DuraEuropos—including Antioch-on-the-Orontes—and the attacks that would ultimately destroy the city involved a siege of the western city wall. In the words of Peter Edwell, “fortifications were not designed to withstand significant attacks and were more directed at establishing Roman authority. . . . Roman internal problems, which included poorly disciplined and organized troops in the East, poor knowledge and experience of Sasanian offensive military tactics, and a defensive system not designed to meet large-scale attacks, made an effective defence all but impossible.”24 If the wall were to be breached, the relatively small garrison at Dura—likely never numbering more than three thousand soldiers—would have no chance.25 In fact, the Sasanian “siege-camp,” which has been archaeologically identified west of the city, was by itself larger than the entire city of Dura-Europos.26 The impending battle pitted a David against a Goliath, but David was trapped. According to Simon James, whose work in military history chronicles the fate of Dura-Europos, the Roman garrison did everything it could to defend the western wall. The Romans greatly strengthened it with “a steeply sloped mudbrick glacis to the front [which enabled a better line of\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n11\n\nfire from atop the wall and diminished the possibility of destroying the wall by impact] and a huge mudbrick and earthen rampart behind. . . . these were drastic expedients involving destruction of a great swathe of the interior (while paradoxically also ensuring preservation of many of the city’s greatest treasures for archaeology to reveal).”27 In the year 256, when the final and successful siege happened, the Sasanians thus elected to dig several assault mines simultaneously in order to undermine or “sap” the wall.28 James uses the layered archaeological evidence—indeed, the only kind of evidence existing for this battle—to narrate the Romans’ strategy of countermining to meet the attackers underground. But in what must have been a terror-fi lled twist of fate, the Sasanians set a fire laced with “bitumen and sulphur crystals” at the soon-to-be-intersection of their mine and the countermine, which had been dug just a bit higher in the earth.29 The noxious fumes then fi lled the Roman countermine and killed its soldiers. The evidence “constitutes the earliest-known archaeological testimony for deliberate use of agents in the form of gas or vapor to incapacitate or kill enemy personnel: what we today call chemical warfare.”30 After conquering the wall of the city through these and other tactics, the Sasanians seem to have razed the rest of it, leaving only ruins in the sand. But the misfortune of that Roman garrison in the third century would become good fortune for historians in the twentieth. The sand hid more than ruins: deep below the western wall’s rampart rested significant portions of many buildings, lined along what archaeologists would later call “Wall Street.” Cross-sections of private homes, temples, a Jewish synagogue, and a Christian house-church were each packed with earth and sealed with a secure date. This Pompeii of the Syrian desert had, in part, buried itself.\n\nExcavating Christianity on the Euphrates It was appropriate that a group of soldiers, not professors, first found the ruins at Dura-Europos. Having been buried at the end of one war, it was discovered at the end of another. In the wake of World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the British and the French retained a\n\n12\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\ntenuous grip on peacekeeping in the Middle East. Although the imaginary (if consequential) demarcations of new nations had been drawn on maps, the borderlines on the ground were less straight or narrow. Factions jostled for land and power in the Middle East, and the situation near DuraEuropos was unstable. The areas along the middle Euphrates found themselves, again, to be living on the edge. Just a slight wind can sweep away lines drawn in the sand. On March 30, 1920, the British army had been patrolling the Syrian side of the middle Euphrates when some troops under the command of Captain M. C. Murphy discovered ancient wall paintings. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gerard Leachman, forwarded a report from Murphy up the chain of command, with the following note: “As a result of our occupation of the old fort at Salihiyah and the digging of trenches, a certain amount of finds have been made. The paintings to which the attached refers are most interesting & should, I think, be seen by an expert. If your American archaeologist is still about, it would well repay him to come & see this. . . . If anyone comes up, it should be soon for obvious reasons.”31 The requested American archaeologist was James Henry Breasted, an Egyptologist from the nascent Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago that was then surveying the upper Tigris for possible excavations. Breasted “seized the opportunity with the greatest pleasure,” and after a harrowing trip across barely governed deserts—“what is very much of a war area,” in the words of the British civil commissioner in his cover letter to Breasted—he and his local assistants arrived at the outpost of the British frontier.32 Just how dangerous the area was would become clear shortly after their arrival, when they learned that Lieutenant Colonel Leachman had been killed by Arab tribesmen during a trip away from the fort. On the afternoon of May 3, 1920, Breasted and his assistants observed the uncovered wall: “Suddenly there rose before us a high wall covered with an imposing painting in many colors depicting a life-size group of eleven persons engaged in worship.”33 The next morning, “we saw to our surprise a small scene in which a Roman tribune was depicted at the head of his troops, engaged in the worship of what looked like three statues of Roman emperors painted on the wall. . . . We had before us the easternmost\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n13\n\nRomans ever found on the Euphrates, or anywhere else for that matter.”34 This was the now famous Julius Terentius frieze in the Temple of the Palmyrene Gods (see fig. 1.1). The lower-left portion of the painting showed the Tychai of Palmyra and “Dura” and thus allowed—on that very fi rst day—identification of the site. Not bad for only one full day of work. Recall that Breasted needed to make haste from Baghdad to Dura “for obvious reasons.” That is to say, they were reasons that would soon become obvious to the rest of the world, for on April 29, 1920, the Treaty of San Remo had authorized a change in the borders of the British and French mandates in the region. During the period around Breasted’s visit, the site of Dura-Europos was transferred to French control, and this shift introduced a new archaeologist to the scene. The Belgian Franz Cumont supervised excavations in 1922 and 1923 for the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, during a time of turmoil and local revolts against French control in Syria and British control in Iraq. His seasons nonetheless uncovered more of the Temple of the Palmyrene Gods, the Temple of Artemis, the city center and agora, the Tower of Archers, several well-preserved parchments, and other buildings and tombs.35 Once peace could be established in Syria, Cumont summarized his “fervent wish” for continued excavation, noting that “there are few ancient sites that may be more fruitful”: By extraordinary chance, an old Macedonian colony has been preserved on the banks of the Euphrates, scarcely changed by the Roman conquest, without any Byzantine restoration or Moslem rebuilding having ever transformed it. The GrecoSemitic civilization is reflected there just as the inhabitants left it, and a climate unusually favorable has assured the preservation of delicate paintings, parchments, and destructible articles which have disappeared almost everywhere else. The combination of so many favorable circumstances should tempt archaeologists searching for a site that promises to be fruitful. Situated on the frontier of two great empires and at the juncture of two civilizations, Dura-Europos, in revealing its history, will throw a new light on the whole Greco-Roman Orient.36\n\n14\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nWith great anticipation but so much work to be done—and in such a remote location—the site needed a major effort by a well-funded institution. Enter Michael Rostovtzeff, who, having just assumed his esteemed post as Sterling Professor at Yale University, was actively seeking a way “to make a truly significant contribution to American universities as well as to Classical learning.”37 With him as their champion, the Americans would team with the French for excavation seasons from 1928 to 1937. Cumont and Rostovtzeff were the scientific directors, while the field directors were the Frenchman Maurice Pillet (1928–31) followed by Americans Clark Hopkins (1931–35) and Frank Brown (1935–37). For the French academy, the former army captain Le Comte Robert du Mesnil du Buisson was appointed in 1932, whose experience with both archaeology and the French military made him a perfect liaison with the governing authorities. Some seasons were distinguished among Middle Eastern expeditions by the presence of women as archaeologists (not simply assistants): Susan Hopkins, the first archaeologist to raise a toddler on the site of a dig; and Margaret Crosby, who broke new ground by being a single woman in rural Middle Eastern field archaeology.38 Among many others who could be mentioned, Henry Pearson stands out: he provided crucial assistance by drawing architectural plans and replicas of art and artifacts in great detail, many of which have not been surpassed. In his memoir The Discovery of Dura-Europos, Hopkins also clearly praises the local crews recruited each season and especially their Armenian foremen, who supervised most of the spadework. 39 Rostovtzeff ’s comparison of Dura to Pompeii may have been hyperbolic, but the decade indeed yielded finds of great importance. The military quarter revealed several buildings beyond the original Temple of the Palmyrene Gods, such as the well-preserved Mithraeum now on display at the Yale University Art Gallery. The remnants of the final siege included a Sasanian helmet, two complete sets of scale armor for horses, and a magnificent Roman shield. Parchments, papyri, inscriptions, graffiti, and dipinti were found in abundance. Large hoards of coins, a Roman bath near the Palmyrene Gate, paintings, mosaics, and household utensils all revealed aspects of domestic daily life. The cultic buildings included temples to Syrian deities, such as Atargatis, and little-known gods from Persia, such as\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n15\n\nAzzanathkona. Temples to Greek gods such as Zeus, Adonis, and Artemis emerged from the street grid. In the Roman world, it was common to honor the deities of a crossroads for protection, as with the Lares compitales of Augustan Rome, entreated at the compita (“crossroads”) of neighborhoods and towns.40 It seems that Dura-Europos, as a kind of “crossroads of antiquity,” was no less fervent in its devotion to the gods of those who passed through its gates. Two of its buildings—arguably the most famous of all—called to mind the deity from Judea: the Jewish synagogue and the Christian house-church, found about 200 meters from each other on Wall Street. The synagogue was the most important evidence of Jewish synagogue art yet discovered, and arguably still is.41 Its floor-to-ceiling wall paintings were uncovered in 1932, not long after the fi rst ancient synagogue art of any kind had been found at Na‘aran (1918) and Beth Alpha (1928) in Galilee. It is difficult to imagine now, but before these and other decorated synagogues from Sepphoris and Hammath Tiberias had been discovered, to name only the most illustrious, historians had presumed that synagogues from antiquity and late antiquity were devoid of imagery. In the words of Steven Fine, “The core assumption that Judaism is aniconic—held for so long by a powerful cultural elite—set the backdrop, if not the agenda, for all twentieth-century scholarship on ‘Jewish art.’ ”42 But if the mosaic floors of the Galilean synagogues were a bellwether of things to come, the image-covered walls of the Dura-Europos synagogue announced the arrival of a whole new field in the history of Judaism.43 “The synagogue had quite as radical implications for our knowledge of Judaism as the Dead Sea Scrolls,” wrote E. R. Goodenough, “if not far deeper.”44 Here, for the first time, was a program of narrative art from a functioning Jewish liturgical space of the Roman era. This leads us back to where this chapter began: it was earlier in that same season when Hopkins and Pearson discovered the house-church (fig. 1.2). It too was a singular find, perhaps even more distinctive than the synagogue. Simply put, the Christian building at Dura-Europos remains the only extant nonfunerary ritual space from pre-Constantinian Christianity. What little artistic and architectural remains are available from before the fourth century come mostly from the Roman catacombs or other\n\n16\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nFig. 1.2. House-church after clearance. Excavation photograph. (Yale University Art Gallery, Dura-Europos Collection)\n\nfunerary contexts and thus allow us to imagine only a limited number of ways in which textual and ritual traditions interacted with artistic programs for early Christians. The word “unique” is overused, but in this case, it is entirely accurate. Like the synagogue and Mithraeum, the Christian church was a converted domestic space. In his book The Social Origins of Christian Architecture, L. Michael White explains: “The Dura Christian building is a true domus ecclesiae, insofar as it was a converted private house, which after remodeling ceased to be used for domestic functions.”45 On the basis of an inscription “in an undercoat of wet plaster” and architectural analysis, White argues that the house was built in 232/33, renovated for use as a church in 240/41, and thus in use as a church for only about fifteen years before its burial.46 The plan drawn by Henry Pearson gives a good sense\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n17\n\nFig. 1.3. Floor plan of the house-church. (Yale University Art Gallery, Dura-Europos Collection)\n\nof the place, and a reconstruction of how congregants might have occupied the rooms during a meeting provides human proportion (figs. 1.3 and 1.4). The functions of several of the spaces are unknown: evidence of the uses of rooms 3 and 5 and the upstairs level is not preserved. The large assembly hall on the south side of the house originally had a wall bisecting it, which was removed during renovation. With the raised platform on the eastern edge, this was likely the main gathering space for teaching, prayer, and the Eucharist (or Lord’s Supper). Approximately seventy-five people might have fit inside for a full assembly. A few graffiti were preserved from this room, but no formal paintings, if there ever were any. Unfortunately, the room’s eastern wall, which was likely the focal point of attention, was not preserved during burial. Whether it contained paintings or perhaps a\n\n18\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nFig. 1.4. Hypothetical reconstruction with congregants in the house-church. (Wladek Prosol)\n\nniche for holding ritual objects or texts—like the paintings and Torah niche in the western wall of the synagogue—we will never know. The room in the northwest corner, which came to be called the baptistery, is therefore our main evidence about Christian art and ritual at Dura-Europos. This room underwent significant renovation in the change from house to church: a large basin was dug and installed under a pillared canopy; a niche on the southern wall was reshaped from a rectangle to resemble a canopy; and all four walls were painted with evocative images. The room was tall enough to contain two different panels, each of which apparently presented a different artistic program. Unfortunately, the upper panel is preserved in only one part of the northwestern wall. Pearson’s isometric reconstruction demonstrates the slope of the wall as it was preserved through the construction of the rampart (fig. 1.5). Recall that Wall Street is immediately to the west of this building, and so the defensive rampart was constructed to slope upwards from east to west. The western wall was\n\nFig. 1.5. Isometric of the Christian building (house-church). (Yale University Art Gallery, Dura-Europos Collection)\n\n20\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nthus preserved almost in its entirety, while the eastern wall shows only the feet from the figures painted on its lower panel. The paintings depict David and Goliath, Adam and Eve, a procession of women, a series of Jesus’ miracles, a shepherd watering a flock, and a woman fetching water from a well. More—much more—will be said about each of these precious witnesses to early Christian imagination in the chapters that follow. But first a question must be asked: why were Christians here in Dura-Europos at all? There is no doubt that Christianity spread quickly and successfully in Syria. The most prominent apostles of Jesus spent time in Antioch and probably Damascus. If apostolic legends have any trace of truth, it is possible that Christianity at Edessa also was born from the first generation of Jesus’ followers.47 Other influential Syrian Christians, such as Ignatius (of Antioch), Tatian (of Assyria), Bardaisan (of Edessa), and Paul (of Samosata) are known from the early second century onward. The satirist Lucian (of Samosata) even saw fit to lampoon certain aspects of Christian ity in his writings.48 And yet the Christian presence at Dura still warrants investigation.49 One theory conceives of the Christians as in competition with, and perhaps a spinoff from, the Jewish synagogue down the street. Tessa Rajak has proposed that the synagogue art—especially its emphases on salvation imagery and bodily resurrection—would have appealed to those with Christian beliefs.50 The second and third centuries CE in the Roman Empire were a “marketplace of religions” overall, she writes, and religious interaction and competition were even more likely in a smaller city, where “groups are in fact more interdependent” and “it is harder for people to avoid their neighbors.”51 The connections between synagogue and church are perhaps supported by the discovery of a Hebrew liturgical parchment at Dura-Europos, which some have argued resembles not only a Jewish prayer, but also a mealtime blessing passed down in the Didache, an early Jewish-Christian liturgical manual likely from Syria.52 One might also defend a reconstruction of Christian origins at Dura that connects them to the strain of thought and practice called Valentinianism. 53 Valentinus was a charismatic Christian theologian, writer, and preacher who flourished in the mid-second century.54 He can be located in both Egypt and Rome at different times, and it is possi ble he traveled\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n21\n\nbeyond that. In any case, his ideas traveled: by the late second century, other prominent theologians, such as Irenaeus (of Lyons) and Tertullian (of Carthage) were writing detailed refutations of the teachings of Valentinus and his followers. 55 The connections of his ideas with Syrian Christian ity may be supported by textual traditions: for example, the noncanonical Gospel of Philip and Acts of Thomas share some emphases with Valentinian traditions, and both are thought to have Syrian provenance. Furthermore, Irenaeus’s descriptions of the liturgical rites of Valentinians share motifs that may be reflected in Syrian liturgy and even the Dura-Europos baptistery specifically. 56 Finally, the stable presence of Valentinians along the Euphrates is well-attested, at least in the fourth century, when we know that a Valentinian “chapel” (or “meeting place” or “sanctuary”) was destroyed by a group of Christian monks near the garrison city of Callinicum on the upper Euphrates. 57 Specific aspects of Valentinian traditions, insofar as they might relate to the evidence from Dura-Europos, will be explored later in this book. One can never forget that Dura-Europos was primarily a military town during its Roman period, and so a third community perhaps responsible for bolstering the Christian population was the army. With approximately 25 percent (and perhaps as much as 50 percent) of its residents affi liated with the garrison, Dura’s population—whether military or civilian—lived amid a militaristic way of life.58 In the words of C. Bradford Welles’s study of the population at Dura, “For the decisive fifty years of the history of Dura a quarter of its area was occupied exclusively by the troops, a considerable part of its remaining space was subject to billeting, much of the remainder was devoted to ministering to the army in one way or another. . . . To a certain extent, Dura was converted into a fortress.”59 It is thus possible that some of the Christians were associated with the military, especially considering the likelihood that many of the private houses in the immediate vicinity of the house-church had been commandeered “to house resident officers of the garrison.”60 In 1969 Jean Lassus traced the connection back further, proposing that Christianity came to Dura with the army, by way of Antioch.61 Recently, Lucinda Dirven has, without being as specific as Lassus, carried on the view of Carl Kraeling that “the Christians\n\n22\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nin Dura were probably people of a gentile background, who were at least partly recruited from men who served as soldiers in the Roman army.”62 Central to these ideas are the four personal names found in the building’s graffiti, two of which—Paulus and Proclus—are Latin in origin and were “borne at Dura only by members of the garrison.”63 This Proclus was the dedicant of the David and Goliath scene in the building, a quite militaristic painting unexpected in a baptistery, and he shared a name common in the military records discovered in the excavations.64 When one adds to this the fact that the only graffiti discovered in the building’s assembly hall depicted mounted soldiers, the proposal of some military involvement on the part of Christians at Dura becomes at least likely, if not certain.65 In the end, though, any proposal of how Christians came to be in Dura-Europos cannot ignore a basic fact: Christianity in the third century was still for many an experience of conversion. For all but the very wealthy, life in the ancient world was always lived on the edge. Health and safety were tenuous, all the more so in a city on the frontier; healing and salvation were sought from many sources of power. The close bonds of Christian communities provided some level of support and safety, and the efficacy perceived in Christian rituals of forgiveness, rebirth, and anointing led to continued expansion during the third century—even amid the first empirewide persecution under Decius (250 CE). In short, it is likely that at least some of the Christians at Dura became Christians at Dura. Their building’s most ornate room was the site of these conversions. Thought at first by some to be a martyrium to commemorate a deceased holy man or woman, it came to be regarded universally as a baptistery.66 The rituals in this space were not to commemorate the deceased, but to initiate the living into new life. The world’s oldest church offers a unique opportunity, then, to imagine early Christian initiation.\n\nImagining Initiation in Early Christian Syria The diverse rites of initiation in early Christian churches have been studied with great success by historians of liturgy and art. Many of these will be discussed in later chapters, as appropriate to specific topics under con-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n23\n\nsideration, but here I highlight the work of a few luminaries. Paul Bradshaw is probably preeminent among current historians of Christian ritual. This is not only for his labor in the editing of challenging manuscripts, whether ancient church orders or modern submissions to scholarly journals.67 He has also done more than anyone to delineate and articulate the core conclusions about early Christian liturgy for which a scholarly consensus has emerged. In his classic work The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship, Bradshaw summarizes some of these conclusions: 1. That we know much, much less about the liturgical practices of the first three centuries of Christianity than we once thought that we did. . . . 2. That what we do know about patterns of worship in that primitive period points towards considerable variety more often than towards rigid uniformity. . . . 3. That the “classical shape of Christian liturgy” that we have so often described is to a very large degree the result of a deliberate assimilation of different Christian traditions to one another during the fourth century rather than the survival of the one pattern of Christian worship from the earliest apostolic times, . . . 4. That what emerged in this post-Nicene era is frequently a liturgical compromise, a practice that includes a bit from here with a bit from there modified by a custom from somewhere else.68 His approach can be identified especially with point 2 above, which emphasizes the locality of liturgical traditions. Ritual practices, like other cultural practices (e.g., linguistic idioms, dress, cuisine), vary greatly in proportion to distance traveled. Such an insight is all the more important in the ancient world, where few people traveled very far at all and mass communication was limited (save for the highest levels of imperial government). Bradshaw indicates the primacy of place in his work by how he organizes his introduction to Christian initiation: the text is arranged by region (Syria, North Africa, Italy, Gaul and Spain, Egypt).69 Maxwell Johnson’s study of early Christian initiation offers a complementary approach. In his books The Rites of Christian Initiation and\n\n24\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nImages of Baptism, Johnson gathers the symbols, motifs, and narratives of initiation from diverse textual genres and locales in order to present four of the key condensations of baptismal imagery from early Christianity: as a participation in the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ; as a new birth and/or adoption by the Holy Spirit; as the sacrament and seal/stamp of the Holy Spirit; and as incorporation into the body of Christ.70 To these four might be added several others that are prominent in Syrian Christianity (but less so in other locales): initiation as an illumination, as an enlistment in an army, or as a wedding.71 Johnson has also edited a sourcebook of ancient texts related to initiation, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, which demonstrates his primarily textual approach to ritual studies.72 In the work of both Bradshaw and Johnson, as in many other recent studies of the topic, the Dura-Europos baptistery is mentioned infrequently, if at all.73 Art historian Robin Jensen shares some of Johnson’s thematic approach to the study of Christian initiation, but she foregrounds the material evidence, especially extant baptisteries. Through her widely used textbook Understanding Early Christian Art, several authoritative essays, and the recent Baptismal Imagery in Early Christianity, Jensen shows how Christians developed a “visual exegesis” of images that complemented their textual exegesis of scripture.74 She explains the adaptation of classical imagery, such as the shepherd, Orpheus, or the sun-god, in early Christian artistic programs, while also being keen to point out when some aspect of nascent Christian iconography seems distinctive or unique, such as the frequent narrative images of miraculous healing, which are other wise virtually unknown in non-Christian art.75 Her more technical book on baptisteries, Living Water, provides comparative perspective on several of these structures from the West, especially Italy, although she discusses the evidence from Dura-Europos.76 In her most recent book, Jensen views initiation as “a synthetic ritual; it comprised multiple purposes and manifold meanings.”77 Her research thus seeks “to explicate the sensory as well as spiritual experience by showing how symbols and figures emerged, merged, and took precedence at various points in the ritual process.”78 She organizes the various motifs under five headings: baptism as cleansing from sin and sickness, as incorporation into the community, as sanctifying and il-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n25\n\nluminative, as dying and rising, and as the beginning of the new creation. Under these headings she assesses the specific figures most common across regions and centuries. For example, “baptism as incorporation into the community” gathers symbols of a Christian initiate as a member of a new race, an adopted child, an athlete, a soldier, a priest, and a saint. The prominent imagery of a sheep joining a flock under a shepherd is supported by rites of enrollment and marking with the seal (or stamp or mark) of Christ, just as a shepherd brands a sheep for its identification and protection. Jensen’s work overall exhibits attentiveness to textual sources, theological topics, and the ritual dimensions of analysis. In what follows, I aim to complement her definitive work by employing similar methods—but focusing on one specific site. That is to say, this book is not about early Christian theology, art, or ritual in general. Rather, it brings all available ancient resources— exegetical, material, ritual—to bear on the interpretation of just one building. I am not the first to offer such a microhistory of the house-church at Dura-Europos. The fi nal archaeological report of 1967 offered a focused and magisterial analysis of the Christian building almost fifty years ago. In some ways its contributions cannot be surpassed; on other crucial matters, however, the time is right for new arguments. The scholar who authored the report bore a name that will appear frequently throughout this book: Carl Kraeling. Born in 1897 in Brooklyn, New York, Carl Herman Kraeling was educated at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania and studied for the ministry at Lutheran Theological Seminary.79 He subsequently taught at the same seminary before being hired by Yale Divinity School in the 1930s—a move that would come forever to link him with the Dura-Europos excavations. Though hired primarily as a New Testament scholar, he demonstrated international leadership in the archaeology of the Near East and was later named chair of Yale’s Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures (while still retaining the Buckingham Chair of New Testament Criticism and Interpretation, an impressive straddling of two departments). Away from campus, he directed the excavations at Jerash (Gerasa) in modern-day Jordan and reorga nized the American Oriental Society. During 1949–50, Kraeling became the head of both the American\n\n26\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nSchools of Oriental Research and the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, whose founding director had been James Henry Breasted—the man who first identified Dura-Europos. There was an elegant continuity, then, when Kraeling began to interpret and publish the findings related to Judaism and Christianity at Dura. He had published an edition of the fragment of the Diatessaron (or “Gospel harmony”) from the site already in 1935.80 Then Kraeling culminated his life’s work as the lead author of the fi nal reports on both the synagogue (1956) and the Christian building (1967), the final manuscript of which was sent to press just two weeks before his death in 1966.81 It is a testament to his excellence as a scholar that most of Kraeling’s judgments about the house-church have not been challenged. As a field archaeologist himself, Kraeling excelled at the task of description. No detail was too small for preservation, since one could not know in advance which ones—color schemes, building materials, unexplained staircases or cellars, illegible graffiti and dipinti—might ultimately aid interpretation. Regarding overall interpretations, his assessment of the likely origin of the Christian community remains the most compelling theory: a core that came from West Syria; numbers bolstered by the army and local conversion; and not primarily a splinter group from the Durene synagogue.82 He had also admirably processed and adopted the still recent theory of Walter Bauer, which emphasized regional differences and local character in the historiography of earliest Christian ity.83 Kraeling was similarly open to the inclusion of noncanonical sources in the ser vice of interpretation. He drew from ancient texts and traditions popular in Syria, such as the Odes of Solomon and the Acts of Thomas, alongside the Syriac writings of Aphrahat and Ephrem. And though the codices discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt were not yet well-integrated into an overall picture of early Christian writings, he nonetheless saw the potential heuristic value of the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Truth for understanding Durene Christianity, since these newly unearthed texts shared motifs and emphases with materials of secure Syrian provenance. Kraeling resolutely described such writings as not “Gnostic” but “regionally typical,” demonstrating an attitude toward the varieties of early Christianity that was rather ahead of its\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n27\n\ntime.84 Throughout the volume, the reader is grateful for the life’s work of a scholar who was eulogized by William F. Albright in this way: “A brilliant mind, a friendly nature, unusual tolerance of others, and an instinct for diplomatic solutions, made him one of the great savants of our time.”85 And yet, a lot has changed since 1967. Kraeling’s research can be extended in three areas. First, though he cast a relatively wide net for ancient texts that might aid interpretation, he was not yet sufficiently familiar with the full range of noncanonical texts, such as the Gospel of Philip, probably of Syrian provenance.86 This anthology of discrete teachings, discovered at Nag Hammadi, contains substantial reflection on ritual practice and “sacraments,” becoming famous for its emphasis on spiritual marriage in the “bridal chamber.” Connected to this was a relative neglect of other sources of Syrian provenance, such as the Didascalia Apostolorum and Testamentum Domini (often labeled “church orders”), that combine to enhance our sense of what rituals might have transpired in the Dura baptistery. Kraeling likely considered it sufficient to draw from better known guides to ritual practice, such as Cyril of Jerusalem’s Catechetical Homilies. In truth, the fields of ritual studies and liturgical history were in their infancy, and many sources either lacked modern circulation or were, as in the case of John Chrysostom’s catechetical homilies, only recently assigned to their proper authors. Finally, Kraeling’s method of artistic interpretation, about which I say more below, was not necessarily faulty, but it was not as variegated as the evidence warranted. For example, artistic programs linked directly to ritual actions—whether a baptism, an anointing, or a procession— encourage different types of interpretation than those prepared for viewing alone. Kraeling’s search for artistic comparanda for the Dura-Europos program can also be broadened to include types and motifs from later centuries. It is possible that Kraeling’s methodological conservatism about artistic interpretation arose to compensate for the overzealous attempts by previous scholars to make Dura-Europos the very linchpin of the history of Near Eastern art. Let us recall that Breasted extrapolated his Oriental Forerunners of Byzantine Painting from precisely one day of fieldwork at Dura. Yale’s own Michael Rostovtzeff was also prone to grand narratives of artistic and cultural migration. In each case where\n\n28\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nKraeling’s interpretation might have been broadened, then, one can find a good reason why he bounded it. The frontiers of research on the baptistery remained open for future scholars to explore. Since Kraeling’s report, scholarship has advanced in small steps. The archaeological details have been treated by L. Michael White, Graydon Snyder, and the combined efforts of authors in two recent exhibition catalogs from Boston College and New York University.87 Writing from institutions in Europe, Dieter Korol and Lucinda Dirven have enhanced our understanding of the David and Goliath and Adam and Eve paintings, respectively.88 Robin Jensen and Everett Ferguson have both incorporated the evidence from Dura-Europos into their analyses of theology and liturgy during the first five centuries of Christian ity.89 And liturgical historian Dominic Serra offered a small gem of an article about the procession of women and the woman at the well in the baptistery, which to my mind sufficiently reopened debate about Kraeling’s identifications of the female figures there.90 In addition to these studies, the only full-length book to treat the baptistery on its own has been Tracing the Bridegroom at Dura, the published dissertation of Gerasimos P. Pagoulatos.91 This book draws on three textual traditions—the Acts of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Symposium of Methodius—because of the likely second- and third-century dates of these works, in order to discuss the relationship between liturgy and artistic viewing in the space. 92 He argues that the Dura-Europos baptistery “hosted an initiation bridal ser vice” that united the participants with the image of Christ in anticipation of the second coming; as such, it was “the earliest known Iconophile ser vice.” 93 He connects the proposed thirdcentury ritual to the still-celebrated “Christ the Bridegroom” ser vice of the Orthodox Holy Week, which is not extant in the manuscript tradition before the eleventh century. Although the work is to be commended for its ambitiousness, its use of three texts not always associated with the Dura baptistery, and its entirely correct focus on bridal imagery in early Syrian initiation rituals, it remains yet to be seen how Pagoulatos’s bold vision of a millennium-spanning liturgical connection will be incorporated into scholarly assessments of Dura-Europos in its ancient context. The argu-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n29\n\nment often reads like “a polemical archaeology of origins,” in the words of one critical reviewer, for which a broad scope of chronology and methodology was collapsed toward the one focal point of retrieving a primitive origin for a beloved liturgical rite.94 That being said, there is no fault in chronological and methodological breadth per se. I too look to later centuries for comparanda. Indeed some of the artistic comparanda I use later in this book were created a thousand years after the paintings in Dura-Europos. I justify such moves in two ways. First, each of this book’s arguments attempts to limit the geographical catchment area of textual and artistic comparanda, so that even as I use sources from later centuries, I give strong preference to those from Syria, Palestine, and Armenia. Second, some artistic examples (e.g., types of processions of virgins or certain Annunciation scenes) offer such striking formal similarity across centuries that I have been compelled to include them in my analysis. It has been precisely such openness to comparanda from the Byzantine era—an attitude that sprang admittedly, at first, from the naive adventurousness of a scholar sojourning in a new field of inquiry—that launched the freshest insights in the book, even as it leaves the arguments potentially vulnerable to criticism. Nevertheless, I maintain as a general methodological principle that iconographic traditions are, like ritual practices, on the whole prone to conservatism. Of course, both iconography and ritual change over time and through the interaction of communities. But even as artistic and ritual traditions evolve and adapt to new environments, they are more likely to add than to subtract features—more likely to highlight a preferred aspect than to eliminate the other one. By attempting to limit the geographical catchment area for comparative materials to roughly Syria, Palestine, and Armenia, I have not, however, limited myself to a small data set. The history, theology, and ritual of Christians in Syria and its environs offer broad and deep resources for situating the house-church of Dura-Europos. 95 Fifty years ago, Kraeling made use of many of these, especially the fourth-century writings of Ephrem the Syrian and Aphrahat the Persian, along with the Odes of Solomon and the Acts of Thomas, which were both popular in third-century Syria. These sources will be gleaned in even more detail, and other sources will be\n\n30\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nincluded, such as the Gospel of Philip and the writings of Jacob of Serugh. Liturgical “church orders,” such as the Didascalia Apostolorum and Testamentum Domini, will be read in the light of contemporary ritual studies in order to imagine what practices and significations might have occurred in this house-church. Artistic motifs from all available evidence, such as illuminated manuscripts, pilgrimage censers, and reliquaries, will round out our sense of place. When the geography is thus bounded but the chronology extended, the distinctive motifs of Syrian Christian thought and practice are brought into relief: asceticism and virginity, illumination and anointing, weddings and wells, healing and bodily integrity. I say more about these themes in subsequent chapters. Not only these contents but the genre and tone of Syrian theological writings also leave an impression. There is little argumentation apart from ornamentation. Hymns are more prominent than treatises. In the words of Peter Brown, to engage Syrian authors is to hear “a subtle and mellow voice from the past that has been too long drowned by the articulate and rigid certainties of Western churchmen.”96 Many of these mystical texts are reflections on biblical narratives against the backdrop of liturgical events, and engaging them alongside the artistic traditions thus leads inexorably to a nexus around which the whole of this book revolves: Bible-art-ritual. What happens when we place the Dura-Europos housechurch and the people who worshipped there at this nexus? How might we imagine the ways in which they imagined Christian initiation?\n\nCan We Read the Riting on the Walls? Like many other ancient buildings, the house-church had writing on its walls. Short texts were either inscribed or painted, and some of them survived until the excavation.97 A couple of dedicatory inscriptions asked for Christ’s mercy on “Proclus” and “the humble Siseos.” An anonymous Christian scratched on the doorjamb leading to the baptistery, “One God in heaven.” But beyond these precious few texts, scholars have also tried to read the biblical “writing” on these walls. It has become customary to think of the paintings at Dura-Europos, in both synagogue and house-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n31\n\nchurch, as among the earliest extant “biblical art.” The scenes seem to correspond to well-known texts from the Bible, and thus the texts (and their traditional meanings) can sneak surreptitiously to the center of the stage of interpretation. We misspeak, though, if only slightly, when we call the scenes in the house-church “biblical.”98 Two hundred years after Jesus had died, a stable canon of the New Testament did not yet exist. Narratives of his life, death, and resurrection circulated in diverse oral, liturgical, and written forms. Any analysis of the relationship between biblical texts and images in the baptistery should account for the general instability of Christian textual forms that circulated in the third century and the importance of the Diatessaron among Syrian Christians. For example, the healing of a paralytic occurs in all four canonical Gospel traditions, the Diatessaron, and several extant homilies; the so-called myrrophores (the women at the empty tomb) are variously described and identified in the canonical texts and are not obviously represented in the painting; the baptistery’s central image of shepherd and sheep is hardly a clear representation of the text of the Good Shepherd from the Gospel of John. And whatever might be meant by the depiction of Goliath slain by David, an image not found elsewhere in early Christian art and whose main character was appropriated in a multitude of ways in textual traditions? It is as if the texts with which we try to line up the paintings will not hold still. One might want to grant such wavering for some textual traditions but retain stability in others. Perhaps the famous biblical dialogue about “living water” will hold still for analysis, since it appears in only one source ( John 4). Then at least the painting of the woman at the well makes sense in a baptistery, right? To the contrary, the instability of biblical texts overall should give us pause about even the seemingly stable text-image relationships in the third century. Women visit wells all over the biblical landscape, and chapter 5 shows the varieties in their interpretation. The paintings are thus not allegorical treasures unlocked by one hermeneutical key—the right biblical text. Often, multiple texts “fit,” and each opens up a different aspect of a given image. This is neither to slide into relativism nor to claim that texts are irrelevant to the process. Indeed, the importance\n\n32\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nof Christian texts for understanding the compositions in the baptistery easily can be shown by contrasting them with those in the Mithraeum from Dura-Europos. Both artistic programs present initiate mythologies, but the lack of an extant Mithraic textual tradition prevents us from understanding most Mithraic art.99 Without the benefit of detailed oral, liturgical, or textual traditions for Mithraic cults, we are relatively clueless in our attempts to interpret one of the most widespread cultic practices in the Roman world. We use texts to interpret the baptistery, then, but we do so with two caveats in mind. First, the stability of textual traditions and boundaries— including the canonical boundary—cannot be presumed. Second, the preferred and primary context for the baptistery’s artistic program is its ritual context. In other words (and to bend the categories a bit), for interpreting a baptistery’s art, one required “text” is the ritual. We are not trying only to read the biblical writing on the walls; even more do we seek the liturgical riting on the walls. We must then expand the written data set to include more noncanonical texts and liturgical sources (homilies, baptismal catecheses, church orders, pilgrimage evidence). Accessing early Christian rituals through these sources is a challenge, of course, as they can be encountered only through texts and art, thereby creating a hermeneutic circle for the historian. That inescapable difficulty is all the more reason why polysemic interpretations are in many cases appropriate. In situating Dura-Europos at the nexus of Bible, art, and ritual, my research builds explicitly on the work of several other art historians. Robin Jensen, whom I mentioned above, is foremost among them, insofar as her work attends to the “ritual, visual, and theological dimensions” of artistic programs.100 She is well aware of the potential pitfalls of such interdisciplinarity: on one hand, “text historians may worry about the degree of subjectivity” involved in interpreting visual symbols that “may seem frustratingly ambiguous or dauntingly mysterious”; on the other hand, art historians “are trained to begin with the images and avoid turning to texts as a primary source for their analysis or interpretation, valuing art objects for themselves, apart from the documents, for their essential beauty and independent significance.”101 Although Jensen inveighs against treating biblical\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n33\n\nnarratives, for instance, as a kind of “lode of defi nitive, preferential, or even validating data,” she presses on with a rigorous interdisciplinarity.102 In fact, despite the different modes of verbal and visual exegesis, she finds in them similar degrees of subjectivity and variation in meaning: Aside from the problems of approach and method, any study that attempts to integrate text and image must confront an essential difficulty—that the spoken or written word undeniably has a different character than the visual image. The two modes are experienced and comprehended in distinct ways. Verbal communication takes place over time. A story, an argument, or an explanation must unfold. Memory plays an important part in following a discourse from beginning to end, and the imagination supplies internal, invisible images that are not externally prescribed. A visual image, by contrast, has an immediacy and concreteness. It is taken in more or less at once and presents only a fragment of a story. The memory and imagination work together to supply the description, explanation, or narrative that the image lacks, and this likewise—and necessarily—varies from viewer to viewer and from time to time. However, that variance is probably no more than that of readers and hearers. Even though verbal forms differ in nature from images, their meanings are no more or less transparent or obvious.103 An emphasis on memory and imagination leads directly to the ritual dimension of Jensen’s work. Because almost all extant early Christian art can be associated with a ritual context (baptism, anointing, pilgrimage, burial, funerary meal, etc.), “effective visual exegesis requires the viewer to make certain connections that were experienced in liturgical per formances (sermons, prayers, catecheses, and so forth) or developed in written treatises and commentaries. After all, an image generally, or at least initially, will mean what one has been taught that it means.”104 For instance, the simple image of Noah coming out of the boxlike ark (which Jensen calls the “Jack-in-the-box” style) has been found almost exclusively in funerary\n\n34\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nsettings, and thus our interpretation of Noah as the individual “Christian rescued from death” is corroborated by a ritual context.105 One could imagine, though, how the prevalent water imagery in the biblical narrative might engender different interpretations, if the same Noah were to be found mainly in baptisteries (cf. 1 Pet 3:20). Or consider how the imagery of Jonah’s ocean adventure is also found mainly in funerary contexts, indicating its symbolism of Christian hope for salvation from the belly of death. If other parts of the Jonah cycle were found mainly depicted on pulpits or book covers, we would rightly interpret the symbol’s connection to his preaching to Nineveh as a prophetic call to evangelism—a reminder to preach God’s word to those who had not yet heard it. In sum, my own research complements Jensen’s: the goal is to provide new possibilities for visual exegesis by opening up the treasury of textual resources from early Christianity and attending to ritual contexts. Other art historians have also signaled ways forward in the interpretation of ritual spaces in antiquity. Jaś Elsner and Robert S. Nelson stand out as standard bearers for approaches to visuality—ways of seeing—in specific ritualized moments from late antiquity and the Byzantine era. Nelson’s objects of study are primarily manuscripts, icons, mosaics, and architecture from the Byzantine to the modern era, but his approach to such materials offers insights for earlier materials.106 Elsner deals almost exclusively with Greco-Roman antiquity—and in one essay, with Dura-Europos specifically. On the whole, he champions “a ritual-centered attitude to images in antiquity, which influenced both ways of seeing and ways of thinking about art.”107 What he calls ritual-centered visuality “may be defined in many ways—as the putting aside of normal identity and the acquisition of a temporary cult-generated identity, or as the surrendering of individuality to a more collective form of subjectivity constructed and controlled by the sacred site,” among other possibilities.108 In terms of the DuraEuropos house-church, this type of visuality might have temporarily enabled a man to imagine himself as a female virgin initiate or a woman to imagine herself as David, an unexpectedly mighty warrior. Then his or her collective form of subjectivity may be considered constructed in part by the paintings, whether as an indistinguishable member of a flock of sheep or\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n35\n\nas an indistinguishably costumed and adorned member of a procession. Elsner continues: “In effect, ritual-centered visuality denies the appropriateness of . . . interpreting images through the rules and desires of everyday life. It constructs a ritual barrier to the identifications and objectifications of the screen of discourse and posits a sacred possibility for vision, which is by definition more significant since it opens the viewer to confronting his or her god.”109 Ritual processes, in other words, prepare viewers to enact visual exegesis in typological, allegorical, and other distinctly theological modes. The everyday rules of visuality for encountering an image of a shepherd, a water well, or a battle scene are temporarily suspended. The viewer draws instead from the narrative and symbolic worlds specifically appropriate for a ritual context—and for which he or she has been both consciously and subconsciously prepared. By taking seriously the few ancient testimonies about what it meant to see art, alongside examples of the real presence of deities in statues and other objects, Elsner collapses the supposed dichotomy between the real and the imagined, the form and its instantiation, the god and its representation. “The represented is not just in the image,” he writes, “the represented is the image.”110 Elsner uses the first-person descriptions of art and ritual in authors such as Pausanias and Lucian as ways into the ritualcenteredness of Greco-Roman visuality. As a result, he questions the art historian’s usual focus on naturalism and aesthetics instead of iconicism and ritual: “Art history has tended to assume that classical art—the art of naturalism and ekphrasis—was much more like Renaissance art and art writing than it was like the arts of the Middle Ages.”111 Most modern historical narratives have tended to link the realistic naturalism of Greek sculpture and its detailed description in literature (ekphrasis) with the revival of such modes in the Renaissance. However, our ancient evidence about people’s experiences of statues, busts, and portraits indicates that the objects were highly charged with divine power and were encountered primarily through ritualized actions, for example, at the culmination of pilgrimage, fasting, procession, or prayer. All of “the evidence for image and ritual should give us pause for thought. It may in fact be that the sacred images of Byzantium and the medieval West were closer to the arts of\n\n36\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nancient polytheism than either the church fathers or the Renaissance antiquarians would have wished or acknowledged.”112 By this turn to subjectivities in understanding the ritual viewing of ancient art, Elsner postulates “a shared subjectivity of cult initiation on the side of viewers,” and his historical analyses thus tend toward probabilities, not certainties.113 The intersubjectivity of initiates during ancient, secret rituals is a challenge to reconstruct, to put it mildly. Therefore, like some of my own proposals in this book, Elsner’s essays must employ an imaginative process alongside other forms of analysis. In a series of case studies, he focuses on “the pattern of cultural constructs and social discourses that stand between the retina and the world, a screen through which the subjects of this inquiry (that is, Greek and Roman people) had no choice but to look and through which they acquired (at least in part) their sense of subjectivity. Just as that screen—what I am calling ‘visuality’—was itself made up of subjective investments while being limited by the material and ideological constraints of the ancient cultural context, so our examination of it must depend upon a certain amount of empathetic imagination as well as critical analysis.”114 According to Robert Nelson, the socially and ritually constructed “visuality” defined by Elsner and others is related to “vision” somewhat analogously to how “sexuality” is related to biological “sex.”115 Like sexuality, visuality transcends biological givens and dwells in the domain of the humanities for interpretation. Just as what counts as normal sexuality is culturally contingent, so too with visuality. One strong distinction to be made between visuality in antiquity and modernity is that ancient visuality bore more resemblance to orality and aurality than it does today. This was especially the case for early Christians, as James A. Francis has noted. A first point to keep in mind: “Hearing the text read aloud, particularly in the context of the liturgy, was the fundamental way in which all Christians [not only the illiterate] appropriated Scripture . . . It is a modern prejudice to assume that once people could read, they would somehow abandon orality and visuality in favor of the textual and literal; that reading trumps all other modes of reception and comprehension.”116 If the oral and liturgical performances have primacy, then the “fi xity” of written texts should be even less of a concern in our histori-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n37\n\ncal work. What is more, such performance of “[a] sacred text, because it was assimilated aurally, lent itself to visuality. The Christians responsible for such works as the catacomb paintings did not use images merely to illustrate their texts; nor did they use texts to justify their images. Rather, both these modes of expression and communication were grounded in a common experience of visuality in which, as with the writers of the Second Sophistic [such as Lucian], the distinction between word and image tends to break down.”117 The bridging of this verbal/visual dichotomy, along with the previously discussed subject/object dichotomy, leads to a mode of seeing for which scholars offer different names: “Mystic viewing” for Elsner, “empathetic vision” for Nelson, “sacramental perception” for Francis.118 While their definitions differ slightly, Nelson’s subsuming of several ideas under a discussion of icons—admittedly of a later era, though all the scholars mentioned argue that iconic practices are prefigured in late antiquity—gathers together most of the ideas: “The meanings of all icons are completed in the space and the person of the pious beholder”; they are “images that envelope the beholder in the visual dramaturgy on the walls of the church and enfold all into the sacred drama and dogma.”119 The meaning unfolds at the nexus of Bible, art, and ritual. A final relevant aspect of interpreting art and ritual in late antiquity involves the importance of movement and its representation, especially that which we call procession. Thomas F. Mathews has argued that in late ancient and Byzantine Christian art, “converging processions—that is, a concourse of figures from either side, worshipfully approaching the axis at which is Christ—provide the principal organizing device.”120 He notes that during the fifth and sixth centuries, the “growing proliferation of processions” in art “coincides with the rise of public participatory processions.”121 From grand churches such as St. Apollinaris in Classe and the “new” St. Apollinaris in Ravenna, to carvings on sarcophagi, or the paintings of the Catacombs of Domitilla, examples abound of processional “riting” on the walls. (In the twentieth century, this artistic program was magnificently retrieved in the nave of the new Catholic cathedral in Los Angeles, California.) Sabine MacCormack connects the development of Christian\n\n38\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nprocessions in liturgy and art to the well-known processional rituals of imperial ceremony, especially the adventus (arrival) of the emperor.122 However, while the imperial connections do illuminate certain aspects of Christian mimicry, in fact processions of all kinds were nearly ubiquitous across cultures in antiquity. “In the Greco-Roman world, figures in peaceful procession were generally understood to be engaged in a religious ritual. It is one of the oldest and commonest forms of worship, and in representations from the Parthenon to the Ara Pacis, the most august expressions of worship assumed a processional mode. . . . In Christian art, moreover, they stood as paradigmatic for the faithful in the endless processions of their cult.”123 Once Christian liturgy fully entered the public square after Constantine, processions spilled out of the churches and into the streets, such that “stational liturgies” can be documented from all over the empire.124 These then became a “principal organizing device” in the artistic programs of early Christians, but that fact did not distinguish them from other cultic communities. For instance, the “Aventine Mithraeum” in Rome, dating to the third century, contains the image of a procession, and Dionysiac processions are a hallmark of extant representations of those mysteries.125 At Dura-Europos we find a procession in the aforementioned Julius Terentius frieze (see fig. 1.1) and the “Purim panel” from the synagogue. Several scenes from a contemporaneous mosaic at Jerash (Gerasa) feature a Dionysiac procession.126 This book’s approach to Dura-Europos extrapolates backwards in time, to be sure, but it does so with attention to artistic and ritual continuities in form. MacCormack’s study of imperial ceremony provides one further analogy to my own method. By using the texts of imperial panegyric—formal, public speeches in praise of emperors and their accomplishments—as a resource for understanding “art and ceremony,” she deals with some of the same hermeneutical quandaries about text-image-ritual relationships as outlined above. For MacCormack, the texts of panegyric are like liturgical libretti—biased and nondefinitive though they may be—that enable access to central public events which formed civic and religious imagination. Although not primarily visual, the performances of panegyric, like that of scripture, prayer, and song for Christian ritual, played a role in forming\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n39\n\nvisuality. “Seen in this light, the panegyric will not merely ‘reflect’ a visual and ceremonial setting by providing valuable but essentially piecemeal evidence for imperial architecture or court etiquette; the panegyric will itself be seen to have drawn its cogency from the context in which it was delivered. . . . Above all, the art of the panegyrist will be assessed by the degree to which he could open himself up to that process of osmosis between sound and vision which was such a constant strand in the sensibility of ancient men, so as to evoke a visual experience in his words.”127 For the evidence from Dura-Europos, we too will imagine what type of visuality was generated by textual traditions, especially in their ritual performances and artistic settings. Already, processional visuality has been explored as a means of interpreting the Dura-Europos house-church itself. Art historian Annabel Jane Wharton, for example, has emphasized a ritual-centered viewing of the baptistery.128 She argues that the differences in artistic form and quality between the procession and the other paintings suggest that the image of procession performed a different function than the room’s upper panel: “Simply stated, an image like the healing of the paralytic, as a statically placed ideograph, is an easily recognized reference to a biblical salvational narrative; it functions optically as a visual sign for a text. In contrast, the procession is haptic [physical/bodily] in quality; its meaning is not located elsewhere, in a text, but rather embedded in the physicality of the action of which it was a part. . . . These figures may be read as self-reflective embodiments of the initiates.”129 Wharton’s analyses will be discussed again later. For now, I conclude by noting that “ritual-centered” theories and “processional visuality” are not as newfangled as they sound. Consider the Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, who wrote already in 1938—only a few years after the house-church was discovered—that the processing women at Dura-Europos were not primarily painted as literal illustrations of a text. Texts will aid our understanding, but in Grégoire’s evaluation the primary “text” is ritualized. His conclusion, published in the journal Byzantion: “Above all, the procession symbolizes the illumination of baptism.”130 In other words, what the candidate saw on the walls of the baptistery—and what texts were imagined\n\n40\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nthrough a constructed visuality—is bound up with what he or she was: a member of a procession, a parallel line to a parallel destination, an iteration of initiation.\n\nWhat Isseos Saw: A Procession of Chapters Besides the names inscribed in the baptistery—Proclus, Siseos, and perhaps Hera—others found in the excavation have possible markers of Christian identity. Consider, for instance, this marking on a clay vessel: Ἰσσε(ὸς) νεοφιτός, or “Isseos the neophyte.”131 It is possible but not certain that the name is a form of the Semitic “Jesse.” Although the jar was not found in the Christian building, scholars have considered the word “neophyte” to be sufficient evidence for regarding Isseos as a Christian.132 (Recall that the unmistakably Christian parchment of the Diatessaron was also found elsewhere at the site.) As a “newly planted” member of the community when his name was etched on the jar, Isseos would have been recently initiated, almost certainly during a ritual of anointing and baptism in the baptistery of the Christian building.133 Perhaps the jar had contained the water poured over him at baptism or the oil with which he was anointed—a kind of memento from the pilgrimage of his initiation. In the ensuing chapters of this book I try to reconstruct the visuality of Isseos, to imagine the baptistery as Isseos might have, as he walked through the door and processed around the room toward the font. I argue that he would have entered from the courtyard and stopped for his prebaptismal anointing just inside the door, in front of the southern wall. Then he proceeded counterclockwise around the room, embodying the right-to-left direction of the procession of women, the narrative action in the upper panel, and indeed, the Semitic languages of Aramaic and Syriac.134 At each point we will consider what textual memories might have been conjured by the candidate’s ritual encounter with an image. Although he would have known much about the mighty deeds of God and God’s anointed ones, he knew no canon. Undoubtedly, he would have been catechized with certain texts for this occasion—words to mark his anointing, his baptism, his victory, his marriage, his joining the one flock—but his texts were not ex-\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\n41\n\nactly the ones that we now study, dissect, and cross-reference. His texts did not hold still. They swirled in his mind that night, as he crossed the threshold into the baptistery, his eyes weary yet focused, because of the requisite fasting. Looking around, here is some of what Isseos saw. On the center of the southern wall, below a niche that likely held oil for anointing, he saw a painting of David and Goliath. Chapter 2 describes the manifold uses and meanings of anointing oil in early Christian Syria. Our earliest sources that describe rites of initiation in East Syria emphasize the roles of anointing to a degree not found elsewhere in early Christianity. In this chapter, its connection to kings and soldiers also comes to the fore, while subsequent chapters will treat the “seal” marked on sheep (chapter 3), the anointing in preparation for marriage and the kindled flames of a wedding (chapter 4), and the oil as a sign of the Holy Spirit (chapter 5). A painting of David would not generally be unusual in any Christian setting, but scholars have struggled to understand why the particular scene with Goliath was chosen. This chapter argues that the Christian community gathered in Dura-Europos memorialized David as a warrior, a symbolization that also called to mind—surprisingly to our modern ears—the images of shepherding and anointing. Central Christian texts and especially the Psalms of David combine to form a militaristic imaginary that resonates with several other aspects of initiation at Dura-Europos. David was a military icon for a militarized town—one that needed hope if it was to face the Goliath of an opposing army across the Euphrates to the east. Turning around to the northern wall, Isseos would have faced the baptistery’s upper panel. Preserved only on this side of the room, the upper panel appears to have comprised a series of the miracles of Jesus. Chapter 3 combines two upper-panel scenes thought to represent Jesus Christ with a third over the font: the walking on the water with Simon Peter, the healing of a paralytic, and the shepherd with a flock of sheep. The scene of the walking on the water shows Peter as an ideal disciple who imitates the divine power of Christ. In Syrian interpretation, Peter’s floundering in the waves was not emphasized; rather, his power over nature was heralded—a power that all Christians hoped to gain for themselves through ritual initiation. The healing scene probably represents that done by the pool of\n\n42\n\nThe World’s Oldest Church\n\nBethesda, thus tying a theme of water between the two extant miracles. Jesus’ reputation as a healer was widespread in antiquity, but in Syria it was even more of a focus, with “Healer” and “Physician” as prevalent titles for Christ there. The prominent themes of the mighty works cycle, therefore, were empowerment and healing for new initiates—in both body and soul. Turning to the font itself, Isseos would see the painting on the western wall, which portrays a shepherd watering his flock. Many biblical narratives come to mind, including David as shepherd, Christ the Good Shepherd, and the foundational Psalm 23 (“The Lord is my shepherd”). The large number of sheep in the flock signifies the communal aspect of Christian initiation, the incorporation of a “sealed” individual into a community marked with the name of Christ. The flock was a safe haven too, amid a dangerous world. Christ and David were shepherd-warriors, protecting those under their pastoral care from various wolves and Goliaths. When Isseos stood at the center of the room, to take in the whole artistic program at once, he would have found the procession of women on the eastern and northern walls to predominate. At the heart of his book, chapter 4 labors to survey and critique the usual identification and interpretation of these female figures. While the traditional interpretation of them as the women at the tomb of Christ on Easter morning has arguments to support it, the preponderance of evidence supports our recovering a very old counterproposal, which identifies them as virgins at a wedding. When biblical, artistic, and ritual sources are read with this in mind, the singular importance of marriage motifs in early Syrian Christian ity becomes clear. The very closest artistic comparanda from Syria render a biblical wedding procession—that of Jesus’ Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins—with the same iconography as the figures on Dura’s walls. That being said, ritual texts and homilies from the fourth century begin to show metaphorical interference between the imagery of weddings and funerals, and so polysemic interpretations of this procession are certainly warranted. The marriage motif dominates, but does not completely subordinate, the notions of d"
