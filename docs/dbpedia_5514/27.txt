As he makes his way from Gyumri Theater Square to Shirak Diocese, Bishop Bagrat is met with warm embraces and requests for blessings from the people of Gyumri.

They stop him and hug, requesting snapshots together. The anthem of the “Holy Movement” – “Armenians, Armenia, Motherland and God” – reverberates through the central streets. It’s worth noting that the streets of Gyumri haven’t seen such bustling activity in recent times.
