It was fought near the town of Castillon-la-Bataille in southwestern France. During the battle, the French army, led by Jean Bureau, defeated the English forces commanded by John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury. This victory proved to be a turning point in the war, as it marked the end of English territorial ambitions in France and led to the eventual expulsion of the English from French soil.\n\n1473\n\nConquest of Nijmegen by Charles the Stout\n\nIn 1473, Charles the Stout, also known as Charles the Bold, successfully conquered the city of Nijmegen. Charles was the Duke of Burgundy and a prominent figure in the Burgundian Wars.

His actions and ideas would later spark a major religious and social movement that challenged the authority and practices of the Catholic Church.\n\n1585\n\nDiscovery of the Babington Plot\n\nIn 1585, the English secret service uncovered the Babington Plot, a conspiracy to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I of England. Anthony Babington, a Catholic nobleman, and his associates planned to overthrow the Protestant queen and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots, who was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. However, the plot was discovered by Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's principal secretary and spymaster.

Raleigh was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death, although his sentence was later commuted to imprisonment. He would remain incarcerated for over a decade before being released to lead a disastrous expedition to South America, after which he was executed.\n\n1762\n\nAscension of Catherine II as Tsarina of Russia\n\nIn 1762, Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great, became the Tsarina of Russia following the murder of her husband, Peter III.

During his visit to Vanuatu, Cook and his crew interacted with the local inhabitants, gathered scientific data, and made observations about the flora, fauna, and culture of the region. Cook's voyages and discoveries played a significant role in expanding European knowledge of the world and had a profound impact on subsequent exploration and colonization efforts.\n\n1791\n\nChamp de Mars Massacre\n\nThe Champ de Mars Massacre occurred on July 17, 1791, during the French Revolution. Members of the French National Guard, under the command of General Lafayette, opened fire on a crowd of radical Jacobins who had gathered at the Champ de Mars in Paris to sign a petition for the removal of King Louis XVI.

The massacre resulted in the deaths of dozens, possibly up to 50 people, and marked a significant escalation of violence during the revolutionary period. The event underscored the deep divisions within French society and highlighted the growing tensions between different factions vying for power and influence.\n\n1816\n\nDiscovery of the Raft of the Medusa Survivors\n\nIn 1816, the French naval frigate \"Méduse\" wrecked off the coast of Senegal, resulting in the tragic ordeal of its survivors. Thirteen days after the shipwreck, the French vessel \"L'Argus\" accidentally discovered a makeshift raft adrift in the Atlantic Ocean. The raft held the remnants of the original 151 survivors, with only 15 individuals remaining alive. The survivors had endured a harrowing experience marked by cannibalism, murder, and suicide. This event became widely known through Théodore Géricault's famous painting \"The Raft of the Medusa,\" which depicted the survivors' desperation and the horrors they had endured. The painting became a symbol of human suffering and the failings of authority.\n\n1850\n\nFirst Photograph of a Star by Harvard Observatory\n\nIn 1850, the Harvard Observatory took the first photograph of a star.

On July 17, 1862, Morgan's forces reached Cynthiana, Kentucky, where they clashed with Union troops. The battle resulted in a Confederate victory, but Morgan's Raid was ultimately unsuccessful in achieving its strategic objectives. The raid, however, demonstrated the audacity and mobility of Confederate forces and had a psychological impact on Union morale.\n\n1866\n\nThe capture of Austrian Fort Lissa by the Italian fleet\n\nIn 1866, during the Austro-Prussian War, the Italian fleet, under the command of Admiral Count Carlo Pellion di Persano, captured the Austrian-held Fort Lissa (now Vis, Croatia) in the Adriatic Sea.

His premiership marked a period of increased British influence in the Cape Colony and set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and political developments in the region. Rhodes' actions and policies have been the subject of debate and controversy due to their implications for indigenous populations and his role in establishing the system of apartheid in South Africa.\n\n1898\n\nSpain declares war against the United States\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Spain declared war against the United States. The conflict arose from tensions between the two nations over Spain's colonial possessions, particularly in the Caribbean and the Pacific. The war was triggered by the explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbour and subsequent calls for intervention to support Cuban independence. Spain's declaration of war marked a significant escalation of hostilities and set the stage for a series of military engagements between the two countries, including the Battle of Manila Bay and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. The war ended with the Treaty of Paris, which resulted in Spain relinquishing control over several of its colonial territories, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, to the United States.\n\n1906\n\nElection of Clement Armand Fallières as President of France\n\nIn 1906, Clement Armand Fallières was elected as the President of France.

The decision came amid heightened anti-German sentiment during World War I. The royal family's German heritage, specifically the king's German ancestry and the fact that the family had originally been known as the House of Hanover, led to concerns about public perception and loyalty. The name change aimed to align the royal family more closely with British national identity and distance it from its Germanic roots.\n\n1918\n\nExecution of the Romanovs\n\nIn 1918, the Romanov royal family of Russia, including Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, their five children, and several of their retainers, were executed by a Bolshevik firing squad in the basement of Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, Siberia.

An explosion rocked the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Port Chicago, California, resulting in the deaths of 322 people, nearly 400 injuries, and the destruction of three ships and a pier. The explosion was caused by the mishandling and unsafe loading of munitions aboard the ships. The disaster highlighted issues of racial segregation and discrimination within the U.S. military, as the majority of the victims were African American sailors who had been assigned to the dangerous loading operations. The conditions surrounding the disaster later inspired the Port Chicago Mutiny, a significant event in the civil rights movement.\n\n1945\n\nPotsdam Conference\n\nThe Potsdam Conference, held from July 17 to August 2, 1945, was a meeting between the leaders of the Allied powers after the end of World War II in Europe.

The investigation revealed that the increase in carbon monoxide levels in the villages was caused by uranium mining activities in the area.

This harrowing event caught the attention of the public and inspired Théodore Géricault, a French Romantic painter, to create his famous painting \"The Raft of the Medusa.\" The artwork depicted the survivors' desperate struggle for survival and served as a powerful critique of the French government's negligence and corruption.
