        "text": "educator, media producer, museum interpretive planner\n\nOverview\n\nWorking closely with designers, curators, and historians, Leonard Majzlin has specialized in museum-interpretive planning and learning through technology in public space. He plans and develops media for museum exhibits, cultural institutions, and visitor centers based on visitor learning behavior and design principles. He also creates writes, directs, and/or produces media for development and fundraising. Prior to his museum work, he wrote, directed, and/or produced numerous business and corporate communications, trade shows, industrial films, and corporate sales meetings.\n\nFor NYU’s Steinhardt School of Education, Culture & Human Development, he developed and teaches the course Media for Learning in Museum Exhibits & Public Space in the EDUCATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS & TECHNOLOGY / DIGITAL MEDIA DESIGN FOR LEARNING MA and PhD Program:\n\nMedia for Learning in Museum Exhibits & Public Space explores the variety of media available to curators of exhibit space and publicly shared learning environments, how these environments are unique learning experiences and how one can enhance learning in these spaces by examining the interaction between visitor behavior, exhibit design and technology affordances. For the purposes of the course, the definition of media and technology is broadened to include every physical or electronic, or sensory means that engages the visitor and/or conveys or generates meaning. The course draws from on-site visits, and other disciplines including theater, architecture, philosophy, audio, installation art, film, photography, video, video games, and social media.\n\nStudents explore the nature, affordances, application, and use of technology through the analysis of site visits and case studies. Emphasis is on in-depth analysis of the visitor experience and the ways by which media choices can create meaningful engagement for the visitor while serving a museum's educational goals.\n\nProjects\n\nOn behalf of the Museum at Eldridge Street (formerly the Eldridge Street Project, a landmark Synagogue Restoration and Preservation Project,) Mr. Majzlin wrote, photographed, and directed (1986-1987) a fundraising media presentation about immigrants to New York City's Lower East Side at the turn of the century. Narrated by Geraldine Fitzgerald, this media piece earned a Gold Award from the International Film & TV Festival, as well as a Bronze award (Fundraising Category) and a Crystal Apple (Best Original Photography) from the Association of Multi-Image (AMI) NY, and was successful in raising sufficient funds to ultimately complete this beautiful restoration.

The film focuses on the connections between the nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industries. (1983 Grand Prize, U.S. Film & Video Festival, Sundance, Blue Ribbon-American Film Festival; Gold Medal-Houston Int'l Film Festival, Certificate of merit-Academy Awards Committee.)
