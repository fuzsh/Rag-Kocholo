His harmonica renditions of fiddle tunes are a crowd favorite! The afternoon begins with the Mississippi Acoustic Trio, Dubuque’s longest running musical group, playing bluegrass, folk, Americana, and country. The Mud Lake Music Society in partnership with the Friends of Dubuque County Conservation announce the return of the Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays series. Promoted by The Dubuque County Conservation Board, this popular event draws music performers from all around the country and began as an effort to bring bluegrass music to an outdoor setting by the Mississippi River at Mud Lake Park. With a focus on audience involvement, each event kicks off with the Pickers Pick-nic starting at noon and going until 2 p.m. It’s the perfect setting to meet and play with other aspiring pickers. Guest instructors help with tuning, answer questions, and then organize the jam sessions. Then at 2 p.m., the main stage fires up with a regional opening act followed by a national touring act at 3:30 p.m., entertaining until approximately 6 p.m. Asking attendees only for freewill donations, the society’s goal is to raise enough money to cover costs and retain a small fund to continue Mud Lake Bluegrass Sundays the next year. Camping spaces are available at Mud Lake Park, along with food concessions and special Mud Lake Bluegrass souvenirs (shirts, instrument, and raffles). No alcohol is served, but visitors may bring their own coolers, and it is recommended that people bring lawn chairs. People are also encouraged to bring their own instruments and participate in the free music clinics prior to main stage acts.

Gravy flexes his passion for soul music and oldies in his production, sampling a wide range of musical styles dating from the 1940’s to the present-day. Nostalgic and often-jubilant melodies paired with heavy trap drums form the usual canvas for his signature baritone voice—reminiscent of Barry White. His accolades include three platinum and four gold singles as well as 10 sold out tours of North America, Europe, and Australia. He has collaborated with his self-proclaimed musical heroes, including Lil Wayne, Chief Keef, Juicy J, T-Pain, and the late Young Dolph. Tallying 6 billion streams and selling 5 million units thus far, he’s notched four entries on the Billboard 200, two in the Top 30 of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, and two on the Top 20 of the Top Album Sales Chart. His newest release, Serving Country, features artists such as Zac Brown, Brantley Gilbert, Juicy J, Shania Twain, and Dylan Marlowe. Carter Vail is fresh off the heels of his sophomore album 100 Cowboys and the success of his Bossa nova-inspired absurdist comedy song “Dirt Man,” which has garnered over 30 million views across platforms and helped him amass 834,000 followers on Instagram and 801,000 followers on TikTok. Despite gaining notoriety for the short form social media content he makes, his “serious music” works in conjunction with that to paint a full picture of a multifaceted and wholly original creative who’s “time is now” according to Hypebeast. Though the Los Angeles songwriter’s sophomore album boasts the same tasteful and turbocharged alternative that dominates his catalog, beneath the breezy arrangements are his most bracingly personal lyrics yet. Written following a devastating breakup, Vail channels messy, heartbroken feelings into nine galvanizing and cathartic songs. It’s as anthemic as it is compelling, all delivered with palpable, tongue-in-cheek charm. $46–$76. 405 Main St. FiveFlagsCenter.com.\n\nSaturday, August 31\n\nDubuque Farmers’ Market\n\nSaturdays through September: August 31 @ 7 AM–Noon\n\nSaturdays in October: October 5 @ 8 AM–Noon\n\n11th–13th and Iowa St\n\nIowa’s oldest farmers’ market offers a variety of produce, meats, cheeses, baked goods, handmade goods, on-site prepared foods, and more.

Today, these buildings serve as a physical connection to an important period in our history. This presentation gives an overview of the types of mid-century buildings that can be found in Dubuque County, and the characteristics to look for in identifying them. Presenter Tricia Baum is a commissioner of the Dubuque County Historic Preservation Commission (DCHPC). She is a native Dubuquer who moved back in 2019 and now works as an architectural historian and preservation consultant. Tricia has a Master of Science in Historic Preservation from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. DCHPC was created by resolution of the Dubuque County Board of Supervisors in November 1987.
