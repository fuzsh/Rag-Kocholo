        "text": "There were Tony Award winners in the audience and on the stage of the Tony Award Winning 54 Below last night. All had gathered to celebrate the 95th Birthday of Charles Strouse the Tony, Emmy Award winning Composer and Lyricist of many beloved Broadway Shows (Bye Bye Birdie, Golden Boy, Applause and of course Annie among many others). Strouse a classically trained composer and graduate of the Eastman School of Music also composed scores for film, TV, orchestral works, chamber music, piano concertos and opera. Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams wrote the theme song “Those Were The Days” for the Norman Lear sitcom All In The Family.\n\nThe evening hosted by Lee Roy Reams featured thrilling and emotional performances by luminaries from the Broadway, Cabaret, and Concert Stages whose artistic paths had crossed with Charles Strouse.\n\nThe performers:\n\nCarolee Carmello, Penny Fuller, Anita Gillette, Alan H. Green, Jeff Harnar, Karen Mason, Andrea McArdle, Donna McKechnie, Steve Ross, Stephen Schwartz, KT Sullivan, and Karen Ziemba, Music direction was by Alex Rybeck with direction by Eric Paul Vitale.\n\nOn a personal note, I’ve included a treasured family photo of our granddaughter Zoe Gelman being congratulated by Mr. Strouse after she sang an Annie Medley at a past Mabel Mercer Foundation Cabaret Convention honoring Charles Strouse.\n\nA surprise at The Pheasantry\n\nThis beloved cabaret room, home to many of our favorite performers when in London, welcomed Jason Henderson for a one-night-only performance, attended by members of the Noël Coward Society as well as the widow Lerner, actress Liz Robertson. Here’s Jason at the Noel Coward Reading Room in London.\n\nA few thoughts on London —\n\nIf you can get over to see any of these shows, you will not regret the effort. Lamentably, I don’t think they could have been done better here—a pity we let the Brits beat us at our own art form, the great American musical.\n\nA proper martini is a must when visiting the sceptered isle, and the best place for this is Duke’s Hotel, where they give this quintessential cocktail the respect it deserves. Duke’s itself is a quintessential British hotel near St. James’s Palace and Green Park. One could imagine Noël Coward sharing a joke and a gin and tonic in the lobby.\n\nIt was uncharacteristically warm in July, but a cold soft drink always refreshes. Beware, however, because they taste much different there—something to do with a tax on sugar that has led to drinks being made with less sugar and more artificial sweetener. Nasty!\n\nThey do not give each patron a Playbill in the theaters, although you can buy what we regard as a souvenir program. I did, and they were worth the investment.\n\nOne thing for sure, when Deborah Silver appears “live” that special kind of energetic excitement… elusive on her award winning recordings, videos, and social media platforms, becomes unleashed in the venue the “glitter & grits” vocalist performs in. And so it was last night at The City Winery in New York City. Deborah always comes fully prepared, bringing her sultry voice, infectious Southern hospitality, impressive musical arrangements, and world class musicians. She performed a thoroughly entertaining evening of tunes from her upcoming new Basie Rocks! album, which is a collaboration with the legendary Count Basie Orchestra to a room full of fans, friends, and family.\n\nHer home town South Florida and NYC friends gathered for the special evening and the Legends Radio folks in attendance will have much to say on the airwaves about the show as founder Dick Robinson, “the old jock” was in the room. Debbie even had “Mr. Palm Beach” Rob Russell come on stage to give a sample of the joy he brings to Florida audiences.\n\nI’m not too good ( as my wife will attest) at describing fashion statements so here are some photos of Deborah on the City Winery stage. The Pier 57 location was rocking last night.\n\nSuch was Sammy Cahn’s answer when asked if the music or the lyrics came first in songwriting. This keen example of the quick wit and verbal dexterity of one of our great musical wordsmiths was an introduction to Sammy Cahn, best friend to every singer of romantic songs in the last half of the previous century.\n\nWho better than Jeff Harnar to introduce an audience to the marvels of this man from the Lower East Side who rose to the pinnacle of songwriting in Hollywood? The answer is no one, as anyone who has enjoyed Jeff’s forays into the careers and legacies of Stephen Sondheim, Cole Porter and Cy Coleman will attest. In a skillfully crafted show directed by Barry Kleinbort, Jeff began with three familiar songs: “All the Way”, “Teach Me Tonight” and “The Second Time Around”. Easy enough, but part of Jeff’s magic is the ability to imbue them with a naughtiness by the mere raising of an eyebrow or inflection of his voice, making the implied double entendres impossible to ignore, and delectable to hear. Jeff was having fun with the music–and with us–and his liberties/inuendoes were so welcome!\n\nCahn’s frequent collaborator was Jimmy Van Heusen, and together they wrote many of the songs that Frank Sinatra made famous and were the titles of some of his albums. A playful duet with guest star Clint Holmes was “Come Dance With Me”/”I Like to Lead When I Dance”, which became a Sinatra-and-his-Ratpack tribute. A brief medley of songs by Jule Styne followed, putting a spotlight on the loneliness of those years for the fighting forces and those they left behind.\n\nBack to Van Heusen for “Come Fly with Me”, in which Jeff was joined by Nicole Zuraitis, Grammy Award jazz singer who scatted her way through that song with great aplomb. This cornucopia of musical delights concluded with Moipei, the triplets from Nairobi whose voices sounded like a trio of angels. Jeff wrapped up the evening with “Time After Time”, another Cahn/Styne gem, emphasizing his gratitude to his audience, his music director, Alex Rybeck, and his musicians Steve Doyle, Ray Marchica and Marc Phaneuf as well as director Barry Kleinbort.\n\nThis evening celebrated the remastered release of Harnar’s Cahn CD from 25 years ago. It was also Jeff’s birthday, and all of us got the gift of sharing the occasion with him.\n\nBirdland presented the return of songwriter Scott Alan, who brought to the stage new talent to sing his compositions. This one-night-only event celebrated his prior hits with some new material in “The Old and The New.” His 2007 debut album Dreaming Wide Awake, led to seven follow up albums that include Keys, What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up, Live, Anything Worth Holding On To, and Cynthia Erivo and Oliver Tompsett sing Scott Alan. Shoshana Bean, Jonathan Groff, Eden Espinosa, Natalie Weiss, Stephanie J Block, Tituss Burgess, Jenn Colella, Norm Lewis and Katie Thompson are just a few of the singers who seek out Scott’s music. He has written for the Grammy Award winning Pentatonix, Grammy Award nominated artists Jane Monheit, Marc Broussard, Marc Feehily, Taylor Dayne, Tony Award winning artists Sutton Foster, Adriane Lenox, Randy Graff, Frances Ruffle, Lea Salonga, film and TV stars Tracie Thoms, Patina Miller, Katie Stevens, Danny-Boy Hatchard, Cheyenne Jackson, Megan Hilty, Samantha Barks, Jeremy Jordan and reality stars Sam Bailey, Collabro, Diane DeGarmo, Christina Marie, RJ Helton among others.His compositions have been featured on American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance, Entertainment Tonight, HBO, MTV and VH1.\n\nFeatured in this concert were performers I had never heard of. On the rooster were Audrey Belle Adams, Beatriz Melo, Marylee Fairbanks, LaRaisha DiEvelyn Dionne, Carla Mongado, Ashlyn Combs, Natalie Ortega, Cassidy Ewert, Eli Thomas, T’Arica Crawford, Jenna Miller Ferreira, Julian Carli & Kendall Paige Parrett.\n\nIf you’ve never heard Scott Alan talk he speaks of depression and alcohol use. What makes this so special is not only is Mr. Alan’s music so incredible but so is his story.\n\nAccompanying the singers was David Fallon viola and Kiku Enomoto on violin and the phenominal Mairi Dorman-Phaneuf on cello.\n\nAlan is a major talent with great melodies and lyrics that tear your heart out. His albums all have stunning arrangements with vocals, and last night did not dissapoint. His writing is intimate, with heartache exposed. His music is a celebration of living through the pain and joys of life.
