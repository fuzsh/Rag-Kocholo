        "text": "On April 19, 1945, Henry “Red” Erwin displayed unprecedented, unforgettable valor for 22 seconds – the time it took for him to hand-drag an activated phosphorus bomb, burning at up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, through an airplane hold to an open chute. His actions saved the aircraft and all of its crew.\n\nEducator and researcher Kris Cotariu Harper, EdD, writes more below on this incredible piece of history.\n\n**********************************************\n\n22 Seconds of Extraordinary Heroism: Staff Sergeant Henry Eugene “Red” Erwin\n\nBy Kris Cotariu Harper, EdD\n\nMajor General Curtis LeMay, commander of the 21st Bomber Command, dispatched a B-29 bomber crew to Hawaii to retrieve the only Medal of Honor available in the Pacific region in order to award it to Staff Sergeant Henry Eugene Erwin before he died. His instructions to the crew were not to return to Guam without it. On April 19, 1945, Major General Willis. H Hale, commander of the Army Air Forces Pacific Area, laid the Medal of Honor on the bed sheets beside Erwin’s head.\n\nHenry Eugene “Red” Erwin, grandson of a Confederate Civil War veteran, was born into abject poverty in Adamsville, Alabama in May 1921. His father, a coal miner, died when Red was 10 years old, leaving him, his mother and six younger siblings with no means of support. They lived on the charity of others and several of the younger children were taken in by relatives. At this young age, Red took responsibility for the rest of his family, stocking shelves in the coal company store for $0.50 or $1 for the night. Sometimes he could bring home a bag of groceries or some treats for the family. Later in life, he recalled, “I came from a poor family in Alabama, had no high school education, no college and no money.”1 In spite of their hardships, however, the family had a deep abiding faith that God would watch over and take care of them and Erwin carried this faith with him throughout his life.\n\nWhen Red Erwin was 17 years old, he left school to join the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) where his leadership skills and work ethic were quickly recognized. He was promoted to first sergeant and given charge of 220 men; he was paid $30 each month and sent $21 home to his mother. In late 1941, Red returned to Alabama and took a dangerous job in the Fairfield Steel Works, which paid an impressive salary of $0.93 per hour. Working with, and handling, the hot molten steel perhaps prepared him for the situation that resulted in his Medal of Honor. It certainly alerted him to the danger of severe injury and the potential for death while working with such materials. In his mind and in his heart, he justified the risks he took when he was able to buy a small five-room house for his family. “One of the greatest moments of his life was presenting the key to his mother,” recalled his son, Hank Jr.1\n\nWith the United States’ entry into WWII, Erwin and his brothers all entered the military service. He scored high enough on the entrance exams to qualify for the Army Air Corps. Later in life, he said, “More than anything I wanted to be a fighter pilot”.1\n\nHe completed basic training and was assigned to Taylor Field in Florida for military flight school. He was taught how to take off and fly an airplane but didn’t have the necessary instinct to master landing – an instinct, said retired Air Force pilot and combat veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Dan Hampton, that must be innate and cannot be taught.1 Erwin was identified as having a “flying deficiency” and was reassigned to become a radio operator and technician. He was crushed by the end of his dream to become a pilot but embraced his new occupation and the knowledge that he would still fly.1\n\nOriginally, he was trained for the B-17 bomber, the Flying Fortress. Later, enthusiastically volunteered for the newly developed long-range bomber, the B-29, the Superfortress.\n\nThe B-29 was the new American secret weapon. Twice the size of the B-17, it was capable of flying 8,000 miles non-stop, allowing the United States to conduct a direct strike at Tokyo. When they first laid eyes on it, the airmen were in awe of the B-29. One airman recalled, “the first impression of a B-29 is, and I’m sure most B-29ers will recite the same words, ‘I can’t believe it will fly. It’s too big!’ The second thought was how beautiful it was. That airplane was almost aerodynamically perfect. It was a beautiful sight to behold.”1\n\nEven the enemy recognized the power of this new airplane. In 1945, the wife of Japanese Emperor Hirohito wrote, “Every day from morning to night, B-29s, naval bombers and fighters freely fly over the palace making an enormous noise. As I sit at my desk writing and look up at the sky, countless numbers are passing over…. Unfortunately, the B-29 is a splendid plane.” First Lieutenant Isamu Kashiide, a Japanese combat ace, recalled, “I was scared!” when he first saw the B-29.1\n\nAs magnificent as the B-29 was, it was not without problems. The development and testing phases were plagued with mechanical issues, some of which were fatal. The problems continued even after the plane was put into use – overheating engines, unstable propeller speeds, unpredictable fuel consumption, defective electrical systems, jammed bomb doors and bombs blocked in the racks. In one example, a major engine fire caused the mission to abort, killing all 11 crew members as well as a firefighter and 20 uninvolved workers on the ground.\n\nOn Red Erwin’s 10th combat mission in the City of Los Angeles, the B-29 to which he had been assigned, disaster struck. The date was April 12, 1945, the same day as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States military, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, died at the presidential retreat in Warm Springs, Georgia. The City of Los Angeles was the lead aircraft in a low altitude bombing strike on a chemical plant north of Tokyo. As the lead, the City of Los Angeles was to amass 167 B-29s, from the islands of Guam and Tinian into a single formation. One of Erwin’s additional duties was to drop three multi-colored flares and one white-phosphorus bomb through a chute near his feet in his station. These would fall several hundred feet and could be seen for dozens of miles, serving as a marker around which the airplanes would assemble.\n\nThe flares, with their trailing lights of color, fell as expected, but the activated phosphorus bomb ricocheted back into the airplane and exploded at Erwin’s feet, immediately engulfing him in flames. “The phosphorus bomb struck the right side of Red’s face and blanketed his upper body with a sticky coating of white phosphorus burning at over 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit…. In an instant, much of Red’s right ear and nose were seared away. His face, hair and arms were on fire and his eyes were blinded,” wrote Red’s grandson, Jon Erwin.1 The airplane cabin filled with smoke, making it impossible for the pilot to see the instrument panel. The plane started to plummet towards the ocean.\n\nIn recollections years later, Red Erwin described the experience as a religious communion with God; he prayed for guidance, and he heard angels directing his actions. Blind and on fire, he floundered around the deck desperately trying to locate the bomb and, once he found it, he carried it in his bare hands, tucked against his side, as he stumbled blindly toward the window in the cockpit. He recalled hearing spiritual voices encouraging him, giving him strength and direction. With superhuman determination, he was able to stumble the distance and throw the bomb out the window. As the smoke cleared, the pilot regained control of the airplane at 300 feet above the surface of the ocean. The entire event took only 22 seconds but, in those seconds, Erwin saved the lives of the entire crew and irrevocably changed his own.\n\nBecause the City of Los Angeles was the lead airplane, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene Strouse, the squadron commander, was flying with them that day. He countermanded Major General LeMay’s standing orders that no air-worthy plane was ever to divert from the mission, and directed the pilot to take Erwin to the newly-constructed field hospital on Iwo Jima, three hours away.\n\nAnother additional duty delegated to Erwin was that of crew medic. As he lay there in excruciating pain, drifting in and out of consciousness, he directed the other men in administering his care. Upon his arrival at Iwo Jima, the doctors’ first priority was to remove the phosphorous particles from his eyes and as much from his body as possible, knowing the phosphorus could smolder within his body for weeks or even months. Based on the severity of his wounds and medical knowledge of burn care at the time, only a miracle would keep Erwin alive. After a three-day stay on Iwo Jima, he was taken to the bigger and more established hospital on Guam.\n\nWhile Erwin lay near death in the hospital, his superiors wrote their recommendation for the Medal of Honor and relayed it to Major General LeMay on Guam. Erwin’s Medal of Honor was processed with unprecedented speed in order to present it to Erwin before he died. The recommendation passed from Guam to the Pentagon, in Washington, DC, to Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall, and then to the White House for the approval and signature of President Harry Truman. His Medal of Honor was approved in a record six and one half hours, which is believed to be the fastest approval in modern history.\n\nIn the meantime, Major General LeMay searched the Pacific Theater of the war for an available Medal of Honor to be presented, locating one in a display case in Hawaii, in the office of Major General Robert Richardson, commander of the US Army, Pacific. Le May dispatched a B-29 crew to retrieve the Medal with instructions to hurry and not to return without it.\n\nUpon arriving in Hawaii, the crew went directly to Richardson’s office but the general was not there. The crew members broke open the display case, took the Medal and returned directly to Guam. On April 19th, Erwin was presented the Medal of Honor. At the ceremony, Major General LeMay remarked, “Your effort to save the lives of your fellow Airmen is the most extraordinary kind of heroism I know.”2\n\nErwin miraculously survived his wounds and was returned to the United States in early May. He had married Margaret Elizabeth “Betty” Starnes, who he met at church, the previous December. Because of his training, they had not had much time together before he deployed to the Pacific, but they had courted through letters and short visits home when possible. Now, as he lay in his hospital bed, completely wrapped in gauze but with some sight restored to his left eye, he watched other women, finding their husbands limbless or disfigured, remove their wedding rings and walk out of the ward. Later in life, he confessed he did not know what to expect. He had been married to Betty just three months when he left for the war and he was hardly the handsome man she once knew. His fears, however, were for naught. Betty Erwin walked over to his bed, kissed him on the small patch of cheek that wasn’t bandaged and said, “It’s good to have you home. I love you. I am here for you.”1\n\nErwin underwent over 40 painful surgeries involving reconstruction of his face, and skin grafting on his torso and upper body limbs, his wife by his side every step of the way. His hand and arm never regained their previous mobility and flexibility.\n\nAfter two- and one-half years in the hospital, Red Erwin left the Army and found work with the Veterans Administration, at first as a file clerk and later as a contact representative and benefits counselor. He most likely suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress, in that he admitted he suffered from “moments of black despair” but, again, he claimed his love for God pulled him through.1 He may also have been an exemplary example of a little-known condition, Post Traumatic Growth, whereby the individual has positive emotional development after his traumatic experience. On the other hand, he may have simply been a naturally resilient individual.\n\nRed Erwin died on January 16, 2002 and is buried in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n**********************************************\n\n1 Erwin, J. & Doyle, W.
