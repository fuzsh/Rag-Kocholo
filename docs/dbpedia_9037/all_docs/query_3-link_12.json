Three years later, after successful runs in Toronto and the West End, the musical made a triumphant Broadway debut, earning rave reviews and winning the Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nRunaways by Elizabeth Swados (US/UK)\n\n45th Broadway anniversary (May 13, 1978)\n\n(Full-Length Musical, Drama / 9f, 11m)\n\nRunaways is a collection of songs, dances and spoken word pieces performed by children who have run away from their homes – blending pop, hip-hop, jazz and reggae, while asking why children can’t remain children.
