Safra Hall in Battery Park City.\n\nThe Off-Broadway show closes this coming Sunday, January 2, 2022. But due to popular demand, two additional post-performance talkbacks with Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Tovah Feldshuh have been added: after the 7:00 PM performances on Wednesday, December 29, 2021, and Sunday, January 2, 2022.\n\nThe one-woman show, written by Mark St. Germain, follows a sold-out run at Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor. The event marks Tovah’s return to the stage in New York City since she starred in Pippin and comes on the heels of her acclaimed performance as noted sexologist Dr. Ruth Westheimer in Becoming Dr. Ruth, which Bay Street Theater presented in association with North Coast Repertory Theatre as one of the first professional live theatrical productions since the pandemic began.\n\nThe production—presented on the same stage as National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene’s smash hit Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish—has a runtime of 90 minutes with no intermission and be performed in compliance with current New York State health and safety requirements for indoor performances.

Becoming Dr. Ruth is a humorous and heartfelt portrait detailing Dr. Ruth’s remarkable journey against so many odds to become a pioneer in the psychology of human sexuality and the world’s most famous sex therapist.\n\nBecoming Dr. Ruth reunites Feldshuh and Schwartz in New York for the first time since their major success with Golda’s Balcony—which became the longest running one-woman show in Broadway history.\n\nTovah Feldshuh is a six-time Emmy and Tony Award-nominee and has been awarded three honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters.
