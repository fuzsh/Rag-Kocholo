        "text": "Join Sean Hartley and the beloved Broadway Playhouse cast of zanies as they sing, clown, play games and introduce children to the great writers of American musical theater. At each concert, children are chosen from the audience to participate in the fun. Ages 4-11.\n\nYou can bet your bottom dollar that this celebration of Annie composer Charles Strouse will inspire you to “put on a happy face.” A three-time Tony winner, Strouse wrote more than 30 musicals as well as chart-topping pop tunes and scores for Hollywood films. You’ll enjoy a mini-production of Annie (1977) and hear songs from the Elvis-inspired Bye Bye Birdie (1960) and more. Some kids will be chosen to join the cast on stage to play a game called \"It's a Hard Knock Life.\""
