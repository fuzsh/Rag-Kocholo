        "text": "Michael Stewart, librettist, lyricist, playwright, and novelist was born Myron Rubin on August 1, 1924 in New York City. He attended Queens College and received a Master of Fine Arts in drama from Yale in 1953.\n\nDuring the 1950's he contributed sketches and lyrics to revues, among them: Razzle Dazzle (at the Edison Theater), The Shoestring Revue (1955), The Littlest Revue (1956) and Shoestring '57. He also wrote for television, most notably for Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, where he collaborated with Mel Brooks, Neil and Danny Simon and Carl Reiner.\n\nIn 1954 Stewart met Charles Strouse and Lee Adams, and embarked on a career in the musical theater, to which he contributed some of the major Broadway successes of the sixties, seventies and eighties. With Strouse and Adams, Stewart eventually began work on a musical which opened on Broadway in 1960 as Bye Bye Birdie. Birdie ran for 607 performances and won Stewart his first Tony as the author. It was also the start of Stewart's relationship with Gower Champion, who directed and choreographed. Later the two would work together on Carnival!, Hello, Dolly! and 42nd Street.\n\nStewart's second Tony (1964) was for Hello, Dolly!, directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. Jerry Herman also worked with Stewart on the Grand Tour and Mack & Mabel. Another frequent collaborator was Mark Bramble. Together they wrote the librettos for Elizabeth and Essex, 42nd Street, the Grand Tour and Pieces of Eight. Bramble wrote the book for Barnum, and Stewart the lyrics. Among Stewart's other collaborators were Cy Coleman (Barnum, I Love My Wife, Nothing But the Truth and Seesaw), Bob Merrill (Carnival!) and Jule Styne (Pieces of Eight)\n\nIn addition to writing for the musical theater Stewart wrote plays ( D. and Those That Play the Clowns) He also wrote for television, worked at times on movie projects and published one novel (Belle)\n\nThe Michael Stewart Papers span the years 1948-1987 and include drafts, correspondence, rehearsal notes, appointment books, clippings and contracts, reflecting the full range of Stewart's work as a writer and lyricist. The collection contains material from all of Stewart's major productions and from his unproduced work. Also represented are examples of Stewart's work for television and film projects, his fiction writing, sketches for revues, and early one act plays, some written while he was still a student. The bulk of the collection is made up of drafts of Stewart's writings and the focus of the papers is on the evolution of the plays from draft to finished work. Correspondence is mostly related to business concerns regarding royalties, copyright, and arrangements for foreign productions, but there are occasional letters from colleagues including Gower Champion, Jacques Charon, Alfred Drake, Tammy Grimes, Dolores Gray, Jerry Herman, Lainie Kazan, Nedda Harrigan Logan, Bibi Osterwald and Max Showalter. Also included are scrapbooks for many of the productions that contain clippings, photographs, notes from friends and colleagues, and other ephemera.\n\nThe Michael Stewart Papers are arranged in eleven series:\n\n85 boxes\n\nThis series makes up the bulk of the collection and represent Stewart's major works, as well as other plays and musicals for which there was a large amount of material. This series is for the most part made up of scripts in draft form. Also included are correspondence, contracts, programs, audition schedules and information on foreign productions. There is no personal correspondence.\n\n2 boxes\n\nThe revues and sketches series includes drafts of miscellaneous sketches, lyrics, and monologue material, as well as files pertaining to titled revues that were produced. During the 1950's Stewart worked with many writers, composers and actors who, like Stewart, went on to successful careers in the theater. Among the revues that were produced are: Alive and Kicking (1949-50) to which Stewart contributed a sketch and lyrics, Come What May with music by Leo Schumer, Shelley Mowell and others, and lyrics and sketches by Stewart, Razzle Dazzle (1951) with music by Leo Schumer, Shelley Mowell, James Reed Lawlor, Bernice Kroll, and Irma Jurist, and sketches and lyrics by Michael Stewart, The Shoestring Revue (1955) with sketches mostly by Stewart, Sheldon Harnick and Richard F. Maury, The Littlest Revue (1956) for which Stewart wrote sketches and Shoestring '57 (1957) to which Stewart contributed lyrics.

The miscellaneous sketches are unsorted although some contain titles.\n\n2 boxes\n\nEarly works include plays written by Stewart as well as files relating to early efforts at directing.

The series contains outlines for television series and pilots, sketches for television including The Red Buttons Show, drafts of screenplays (which do not appear to have been produced), a limited amount of correspondence and several scripts for The Polly Bergen Show. Although Stewart wrote for Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, none of these scripts were found in the collection.\n\n3 boxes\n\nIn addition to his work as a playwright, Stewart was a published novelist. Files for his novel Belle, published in 1977, include drafts, reviews and a small amount of correspondence.
