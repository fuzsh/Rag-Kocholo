        "text": "“BYE BYE BIRDIE,” which on Thursday opens for its first Broadway revival in a Roundabout production at the newly renovated Henry Miller’s Theater, has for years been one of the most produced shows in the United States. Like Disney’s “High School Musical,” which may overtake it someday, “Birdie” is a standby in high schools, where its appeal is practically guaranteed. It has a large number of teenage parts, most of them easy to sing and perform, and the plot, such as it is, is all about the generation gap. On progressive high school stages these days, it’s not unheard of for the principal to take the role of the uptight Mr. MacAfee, who just doesn’t understand what’s wrong with kids today.\n\nAt the same time, “Bye Bye Birdie,” which opened in 1960 and is set in the late ’50s, is a sweetly innocent show, with nothing in the book or lyrics to offend protective parents or nervous school board members. The only thing that gets smoked is cigarettes.\n\nSo why then, in an era starved for cheerful, entertaining musicals and when practically everything else has been revived, has it taken Broadway 50 years to resuscitate “Birdie”? (We will pass over “Bring Back Birdie,” a misbegotten 1981 sequel that tried to do just what the title says.) The show has such a following that you could probably fill a Broadway theater for weeks just with people who have themselves been in it.\n\nBut that foolproof reputation may be a little misleading, for the evidence suggests that “Birdie” is harder to put on professionally than it looks. A 1991 road-show version, for example, starring the seemingly sure-fire Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking, made money but received mostly lukewarm reviews. An Encores! concert version in 2004 fared better critically but failed to generate much buzz.\n\nThe problem with the Tune-Reinking version, in the opinion of Charles Strouse, who wrote the music for “Birdie,” was that it was overly ironic and ad-libbed too much. It didn’t trust the story. The same was true of the 1963 film version, which reworked the script to showcase Ann-Margret, though she was long in the tooth to play the teenage Kim MacAfee. (Her performance, nevertheless, has been a touchstone on this season’s “Mad Men,” in which Salvatore has filmed a commercial that imitates her opening number.)\n\nThe two principals  the music promoter Albert Peterson and his secretary and girlfriend, Rosie Alvarez  are tricky to cast because they can seem to have wandered in from another, more old-fashioned show. “Bye Bye Birdie” is often called the first rock ’n’ roll musical, and Mr. Strouse and Lee Adams, who wrote the lyrics, recalled recently that the show was thought to be so revolutionary that they had a hard time raising money for it. But that says more about Broadway’s obliviousness and incomprehension when it came to rock ’n’ roll than it does about the show itself. “Birdie” has only two rock numbers, if you can call them that (rockabilly is more like it), and they’re parodies, like the title character, the hip-swiveling pop star Conrad Birdie. He’s based on Elvis Presley, whose 1958 induction into the Army was the show’s inspiration.\n\nIt’s no accident that the two “Birdie” songs to escape the show’s orbit and take on some independent life “Put On a Happy Face,” which could almost be a Depression song, and “A Lot of Livin’ to Do,” which has a big-band swing  sound as if they had been written before rock was dreamed of. Emotionally the show sympathizes with the teenagers, but musically it comes down on the side of traditional Broadway tunes and a classic Broadway romance: between a workaholic mama’s boy and a Latin spitfire who makes him realize that his true calling is not promoting rock ’n’ roll but to be, of all things, an English teacher.\n\nThe show’s core, in other words, is Albert and Rosie, and the two originals in the part, Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera, still cast an imposingly long shadow. Mr. Van Dyke, who brought winsome charm to what in the wrong hands can be a charmless role, was then a virtual unknown. He got the job partly because he had struck up a backstage friendship with Mr. Strouse. Ms. Rivera, so sexy that you really would become an English teacher to please her, was a hit as Anita in “West Side Story” but had never been cast as a Broadway lead. The part came her way at the last minute when the first Rosie lost her voice. (The character was originally a young woman of Polish descent, and it was quickly rewritten to reflect a Hispanic background.)\n\nThe director and choreographer, the dancer Gower Champion, was also a rookie, just beginning his second career. Mr. Strouse said, “Josh Logan once told me that every hit show is a fluke  fluke of the right people together at the right time with the right script  and that’s what ‘Bye Bye Birdie’ was, a lucky fluke.”\n\nAccording to Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout, the Van Dyke-Rivera strategy  casting a couple of talented no-names and crossing your fingers  is really a second choice these days. “Your first choice,” he said, “is to get a star who’s also great.”\n\nIn a workshop a year and half ago, the Roundabout tried out Gavin Lee, who was then Bert (the Dick Van Dyke role, perhaps not coincidentally) in “Mary Poppins,” and Stephanie J. Block, then Elphaba in “Wicked.” When it came time to cast “Birdie” she was already in “9 to 5,” but Mr. Strouse said he didn’t think she had Rosie’s fiery temperament anyway. And though he didn’t have casting approval of the two leads, he didn’t think Mr. Lee was quite right, either.\n\nAlbert and Rosie are now John Stamos and Gina Gershon. He is coming off three years on the television series “E.R.,” and she has a cultish following of her own from movies like “Showgirls,” “Bound” and “Prey for Rock & Roll.” (Mr. Haimes said he hadn’t been aware that Nolan Gerard Funk, who plays Birdie, is a preteen heartthrob thanks to the Nickelodeon musical “Spectacular!,” but that bit of casting isn’t going to hurt the box office either.) Still, what most recommended Mr. Stamos and Ms. Gershon, Mr. Haimes said, is that “they’re both friends of ours”: both appeared in the Roundabout revival of “Cabaret,” he as the M.C. and she (though not at the same time) as Sally Bowles.\n\nWhat makes “Birdie” so hard to cast, and also what accounts for its being taken for granted, Mr. Strouse suggested, is its very familiarity. “Everybody’s seen it, or they think they have,” he said.\n\n“Or they’ve seen the movie,” Mr. Adams added, grimacing.\n\nNeither Mr. Strouse nor Mr. Adams has much good to say about the film version, except that it made them some money and forced them to write a title song, which now closes the musical.\n\nRobert Longbottom, the director of the revival  which also stars Bill Irwin, whom he calls the show’s “secret weapon,” as Mr. MacAfee  said: “I think the score of ‘Bye Bye Birdie’ is greatly underappreciated, with a lot of terrific songs. It’s a classic American musical. I’ve never understood, for example, why ‘Baby, Talk to Me’ didn’t become a Frank Sinatra standard.”\n\nEven so, he added, he hesitated when asked to bring back “Birdie” and insisted on workshopping it first. “I wanted to see what it felt like to reinvent all those iconic roles,” he said. “Could you make them seem fresh? And as a director-choreographer, the first thing I wanted to know was, does it still make me want to dance.”\n\nOn the other hand, he went on, he resisted the notion of tweaking or modernizing the show. “I didn’t think it wise to deconstruct ‘Bye Bye Birdie,’ whatever deconstructing it might mean. So many people know it and have even been in it themselves. It’s an old-fashioned show, and you can’t reset it in the future.” He added that he was tired of productions that commented cynically on Presley and the ’60s. “That’s just calcified,” he said, suggesting that the musical has parallels to our own era  to Ryan Seacrest and “American Idol,” for example  that audiences can figure out on their own.\n\nMr. Strouse, who turned 81 recently, and Mr. Adams, 85, are like an old vaudeville team. They finish each other’s sentences and set each other up for punch lines. They were in high spirits at a recent run-through of the show, with full orchestra, at a Midtown rehearsal hall. When Mr. Longbottom asked him how it sounded, Mr. Strouse beamed and said, “Well, I think they should play it all over again.”\n\nMr. Strouse and Mr. Adams were particularly enthusiastic about the teenagers Mr. Longbottom had assembled from more than 1,400 who auditioned. “This is much better than having 30-year-old chorus girls pretending to be 16,” Mr. Strouse said. Side by side, the show’s young singers and dancers were like a diorama of youthful energy and variety, with every conceivable teenage type represented. Some were barely pubescent, a couple wore braces, and one girl, when she opened wide to belt out the title song, revealed a wad of gum parked inside her cheek.\n\nAfterward the two men reminisced about their struggles to write a musical, beginning with their days at Green Mansions, a summer camp in the Catskills, where they wrote weekly revues together. “I was so envious of everyone who had a real show,” Mr. Strouse said.\n\nTalking about trying to find investors for “Birdie,” Mr. Adams said, “We’d play it for them, and the agents just walked out.”\n\nMr. Strouse said, “It was our first show, and there are still so many warm memories.” He thinks often, he said, of Michael Stewart, who wrote the book for “Bye Bye Birdie” and who died in 1987. “I remember when we tried out in Philadelphia, which is what you did back then,” he said. “I was so nervous I went to hide in a broom closet in the theater. I opened the door and heard a growl. It was Mike. He was already in there.”"
