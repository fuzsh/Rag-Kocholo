        "text": "He was working as a rehearsal pianist for a Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer show called \"Saratoga\". The stage manager, Edward V. Padula, had heard one of Strouse's \"Green Mansions\" songs. Padula needed a composer for an idea he had for a musical about teenagers. It became \"Bye Bye Birdie\". Strouse not only composed the music, he played piano for the auditions.\n\nWon three Tony Awards: in 1961, for music of Best Musical winner \"Bye, Bye Birdie\"; in 1970, for music of Best Musical winner \"Applause\"; and in 1977, as Best Score, his music with Martin Charnin's lyrics for \"Annie\". He was also Tony-nominated four other times: in 1965, for music of Best Musical nominee \"Golden Boy\"; in 1981, as Best Score, his music with David Rogers' lyrics, for \"Charlie and Algernon\"; in 1987, as Best Score, his music with Stephen Schwartz' lyrics for \"Rags\"; and in 1992, as Best Score (Musical), his music with Richard Maltby Jr.'s lyrics for \"Nick and Nora\".\n\nIn the early 1950s, he was asked to write songs for weekly revues at an Adirondacks summer camp, Green Mansions. He wrote and orchestrated his songs, and copied all the vocal and instrumental parts.\n\nHe studied at the Eastman School of Music. He was a student of Aaron Copland at the Tanglewood Music Center (Massachusetts) and of the legendary Nadia Boulanger in Paris. After returning from France, he wrote serious compositions. To make ends meet, he played piano for singers in nightclubs."
