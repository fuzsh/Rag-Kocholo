Under the agreement, Warner/Chappell will administer Strouse’s entire body of work.\n\nStrouse is the Grammy, Emmy, and Tony Award-winning composer of the musicals Bye Bye Birdie, Annie, Applause, Golden Boy, All-American, and Rags, as well as 14 other shows. His film scores include the Academy Award-winning Bonnie & Clyde, The Night They Raided Minsky’s, and All Dogs Go To Heaven.\n\n“I’m delighted to be part of Warner/Chappell, a premier force in American music, and whose standards for many years have consistently remained the highest in the publishing industry,” said Charles Strouse.\n\n“Charles has written some of Broadway and Hollywood’s most-cherished musicals and scores. We’re very excited to welcome a composer of his stature to the Warner/Chappell family,” said Jon Platt, President, North America, Warner/Chappell Music.\n\n“Charles is an icon in theatre and film,” added Sean Patrick Flahaven, Senior Vice Present, Theatre & Catalog Development, Warner/Chappell Music. “His work continues to delight and inspire millions, and we’re glad he’s found a publishing home among the many great songwriters here.”\n\nSome of Strouse’s iconic standards include “Tomorrow,” “You’re Never Fully Dressed without a Smile,” “Put on a Happy Face,” “A Lot of Livin’ to Do,” and “Once Upon a Time.” He also wrote “Those Were the Days,” the theme song to the classic TV series, All in the Family.\n\nIn 1999, his song, “It’s The Hard Knock Life,” was sampled by Jay-Z for his 5x-platinum “Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem).” A new feature film adaptation of Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, and Quvenzhane Wallis, will be released by Columbia Pictures this December, with soundtrack contributions from Jay-Z, Sia, and several other major urban pop artists.\n\nStill very active, his latest Broadway-bound shows include stage musical adaptations of Marty and Minsky’s.
