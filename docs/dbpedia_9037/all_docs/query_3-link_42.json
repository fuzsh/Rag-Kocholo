Highlights and key findings of the study are summarized on the next page. The project focused on helping the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) identify how information needs associated with a changing health care system are perceived by a wide variety of user groups and constituencies, including those representing providers, insurers, purchasers, consumers, and government at various levels. The impetus for the project stems from a wide-spread perception that the health care marketplace is changing rapidly in ways that will require information about changes in the components of the health system and their interrelationships, as well as on the effect of these changes on institutions and public policy objectives. The project is intended to help HHS’ Data Council to identify implications for HHS activity, as well as where HHS may have a role in helping to address these issues or support others in addressing them.\n\nThe study included two stages of data collection. The first was a broad-based review of perceived gaps, their causes, and the activities generated in response to these perceptions, as identified through interviews with over 50 individuals and a review of relevant literature and Web sites. The second involved obtaining more comprehensive information on a diverse group of 11 entities identified in the first stage as involved in broad-based efforts of interest nationally including the resources and structure of the system, the care process, and the outcomes of that process.\n\nProject Context\n\nVirtually all those we interviewed expressed a sense of the enormity of change in the marketplace and the span of effects from this change. There is widespread agreement that the serious gaps in “supply side” information on the health system that predated these changes have only grown worse as the system has evolved. These stakeholders recognize the prominent role of market-place strategies in driving change, spurred both by purchasers and by changes in medical practice and technology. They also see considerable instability and geographical diversity in markets. Despite change, fundamental problems, like care for the uninsured, continue, with new problems emerging, like those associated with changes in the physician-patient relationship in a managed care environment. Stakeholders also perceive that emerging provider organizations and managed care models are becoming increasingly complex, with overlapping ownership and contractual linkages among component parts of the health care system. Moreover, provider networks serve diverse managed care products.\n\nPerceived Mismatches Between Information Needs and Available Information\n\nHistorically, the greatest amount of information has been collected on the structure and components of care that define available resources. Less information has been collected on operational process and performance, particularly in the ambulatory setting, and least has been collected on outcomes of care. However, gaps exist within each of these three types of health information.\n\nHighlights and Key Findings\n\nHHS’s interest in the information needs and associated data gaps created by the rapid transformation of the health system clearly strikes a responsive chord among diverse stakeholders. Our findings show that stakeholders perceive information on the “supply side” of the health system to be very important, with gaps in data serving as a major obstacle to their efforts to serve their constituency, address operational needs, and participate in the policy process.\n\nWe focused on supply side information (i.e. health care suppliers, and insurers and what they report) and identified three types of information: (1) components and structure of the system (that is, the inputs to care), (2) operational process and performance features; and (3) the policy-relevant outcomes of health care delivery.\n\nWe found two major ways in which the current environment has intensified the need for information. First, the growth of managed care and consolidation has generated a heightened demand for information on the structure and linkages in the health care system. Second, the growing interest in accountability, competition and cost containment has heightened the focus on having good operational data on performance or outcomes achieved by health plans and providers for specific populations.\n\nStakeholders point to a number of critical questions as illustrative of the kinds of information needed. To answer these questions, there would need to be: (1) better information on health insurers/plans and the arrangements through which providers are linked with plans and integrated systems, and (2) better transaction level data, with appropriate clinical detail and structural links to support analysis of operational performance and outcomes.\n\nStakeholders also perceive that national data are not sufficient in today’s environment. State and local level data are needed as well. Further, they want data to be flexible enough to support diverse analyses and timely enough to be relevant when the health care system is rapidly changing.\n\nWe identified 23 ongoing efforts within the private sector, states and foundations/research communities to address data gaps and studied 11 of them more comprehensively. Though sponsors of these activities perceive them to be focused on high priority issues, they also perceive significant limitations in the scope of their efforts. These arise because of limited resources, lags in data availability which limit timeliness, and less willingness to provide information in a highly competitive environment with extensive data demands. In addition, quality problems and inconsistencies in available information, combined with a lack of standardization or audit, serve as barriers to enhancing information.\n\nHistorical Context for Available Information and New Information Needs\n\nHistorically, users of information on the health system have relied heavily on private and statebased sources that complement federal efforts. Information on health system components, resources and structures has been maintained separately for health providers and health insurers. The focus has mainly been on information about discrete entities or individual providers rather than their characteristics or relationships with one another. Information on process of care has been based mainly on discharge/encounter level data for institutional services. Data from which outcome measures can be constructed have been highly limited.\n\nWe found that many but not all of the information needs and gaps cited in our study have been the focus of attention in previous studies, that preceded the current market changes. These studies include those by the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics, the Institute of Medicine, the Health Care Financing Administration, and foundations particularly concerned with state data. The existing studies have focused on the inputs and outputs of care rather than on the way these inputs are organized and structured and the effects of these structures--a topic of considerable interest to many of those we spoke with in the private sector. Further, many of the needs identified in earlier studies remain today.\n\nAssessing Emerging Issues and Needs\n\nOur respondents provided insights into the kinds of questions that they cannot address well with existing information. We summarize very briefly below this topic, addressed and described more fully in the report.\n\nHealth Care Structure. Most current information on the structure of the health care system is oriented toward the counting of the individual types of resources (like providers, facilities, or health plans) that make up the structure. In contrast, our project showed that there is a need for much better information that can be used to assess the adequacy of these resources, changes in them, and the relationships of these resources both to one another and to the existing financing system. For example, who is buying and selling medical practices? What is the right benchmark for medical staffing? What are the characteristics of health plans in different markets? In addition, there is a perception that much more information is needed to support assessing medical practice and training needs, particularly for physicians which tend to account for most existing resources. For example, how many physicians do we really need? Concerns also are widespread over limitations in information on the financing for the health care system and the absence of data on employers. The latter are viewed as increasingly active in driving marketplace change and influencing public policy outcomes.\n\nOperational Process and Performance of Health Care Providers and Plans. There are three types of needs here. The first is a need for better knowledge of the structure of and responsibility for the process of care given the growth of managed care and integrated systems in an increasingly competitive marketplace. For example, who is actually providing the care, how does a patient reach a provider and what incentives influence the care a provider considers? The second is a need for information to support understanding how structural relationships, like the transfer of risk or growth of technology, influence the process of care. For example, do physicians actually know and understand the contractual provisions that influence their pay? The third is for information that provide insight on the relative efficiency of individual providers or health plans in an increasingly competitive marketplace. For example, what really are the differences in cost or performance between teaching hospitals and others?\n\nOutcomes of Care Delivery. This kind of information has been the least developed historically and is viewed as increasingly valued by those concerned both with assessing the value of care and with understanding its costs and distributional implications. One key issue is how to interpret information on practice when there are no benchmarks or standards for practice. For example, is a caesarian section rate that falls or is below average too high or too low? Simply having outcome information, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis that can be compared across providers or plans, is a problem. Costs as outcome measures, are a second key issue, with current data providing limited insight on the costs of achieving given outcomes or on how capitation or ambulatory care delivery each influence cost. A third key issue is how to interpret current population-based information on access and distribution (like insurance coverage or uncompensated care) in today’s market-place. For example, if uncompensated care drops, is this a positive sign that more individuals are insured/able to pay for their own health care or does it mean providers are less willing to see the uninsured?\n\nCross-Cutting Issues and Needs. Across structure, process, and outcome measures, there are concerns that information needed to address issues at the state and local level are also lacking and that existing data systems have some inherent weaknesses that undercut the utility of information. These include weaknesses in the clinical components of information systems, inconsistencies in data derived from plans built around diverse models, and inconsistencies in the data available centrally about managed care plans regulated differently across insurance systems or states.\n\nSummary List of Key Data Gaps. Table S.1 summarizes the key data gaps that limit the ability of stakeholders to answer the questions they need to answer in today’s market. In terms of structure, there is limited and incomplete information on insurance and health plans, as well as on ambulatory and community providers. The limited information on insurance/health plans is a particularly large problem because it complicates the already challenging need to generate better information about how providers in the health care system are linked to one another and with health plans. Getting better information on various facets of these systems was a key need perceived across a variety of stakeholders.\n\nThe absence of standardized transaction level data with appropriate clinical content that can be flexibly analyzed and linked to cost and outcomes is a key data gap that serves as a barrier in addressing many of the questions stakeholders have about the process of care and outcomes of the health system.\n\nTABLE S.1\n\nSUMMARY OF DATA GAPS IDENTIFIED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nComponent Parts of the Health Care System\n\nNo comprehensive census of health insurance plans or arrangements exists\n\nLimited information available on community based alternatives to long term care, intermediate models\n\nData on ambulatory care and non-physician providers is limited, incomplete, and inconsistent.\n\nLinkages among Parts of the System\n\nLittle information on ownership and/or aggregation of physicians and/or hospitals\n\nIntegration and arrangements (including transfer of risk) between health plans and provider entities and their constituent individual providers not identifiable in data.\n\nLinkages across the continuum of care not identifiable in data.\n\nDuplication exists across diverse data collection efforts\n\nPROCESS AND OUTCOMES\n\nTransaction level information on services which can be linked to individuals, providers, or health plans are often absent\n\nClinically relevant data are limited.\n\nNeed the ability to link expenditure data to functional role rather than setting\n\nMore meaningfully categorized expenditure data are needed including out of pocket spending and spending for given outcomes or people\n\nCROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS: GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY\n\nState specific data are often lacking for all or some states. Data for policy relevant localities (e.g. inner city) is even more limited\n\nData need to be adjustable for residence versus service location (especially when areas cross states)\n\nData need to support consistent trend analysis but data captured need to be flexibly defined and timely to account for change in the health system\n\nData should permit flexible aggregation at different levels (e.g. service level; provider level; patient level; or population level)\n\nData need to be capable of being linked to relevant population-based units to support targeted analysis (e.g., individual with a given health problem).\n\nSOURCE: MPR Analysis\n\nExtent to Which Gaps are Being Addressed\n\nThrough our interviews, we identified a number of efforts initiated in response to concerns about information needs associated with today’s evolving marketplace and the data gaps that exist. Many of these are modifications in or expansion to ongoing data collection by associations to develop\n\ninformation needed by their members. Other efforts take the form of independent research funded by states, foundations and other parties to fill the gaps. The 11 efforts selected by HHS for the second phase of our project include ongoing national data collection activities by the American Hospital\n\nAssociation, American Medical Association, American Association of Health Plans, American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, Association of American Medical Colleges, and National Committee on Quality Assurance, along with selected state and foundation funded efforts.\n\nTable S.2 summarizes the focus of and impetus for the 11 efforts we studied in the second phase of our work and describes their weaknesses. Sponsors of these efforts perceive them to reflect attempts to respond to the priority data gaps they perceive. But they also view these efforts be relatively limited\n\ncompared with the needs. Limits on the players’ authority and resources restrict the amount of information that can be collected and who will provide it. Other barriers to better information include a lack of consistency in definitions used by reporting units and limitations in the willingness to supply\n\ninformation in a highly competitive and demanding marketplace. At least three national associations have recently been forced to make some cuts in their data collection activities in response to budgetary constraints or marketplace concerns, an irony given the heightened demand they perceive for information.\n\nInsights into These Topics for HHS\n\nDespite the diversity of the user community, we found a striking similarity in many of the perceived needs and information gaps. These include considerable shortcomings in the information available on the internal structure and operational process of the health system as it becomes more integrated and complex. There also are concerns about how well performance and outcomes of the system can be measured, either as a whole or for its components. It is clear that stakeholders we interviewed perceive that information on the supply side of the system is very important. Yet in today’s environment, there are ironically growing fiscal and proprietary barriers that limit data collection.\n\nA General Role and Need for HHS. Based on the information we obtained, we conclude that private sector stakeholders and states alone cannot address the concerns we identified. In the perception of most of those we spoke with, the private sector does not have the legislative authority inherent in government to require compliance nor the scope of influence needed to capture information that individual constituencies feel they need on the health system and its increasingly complicated organizational arrangements. States are limited both by resources and by the increasing consolidation of the system that limits the utility of state-based information in a context of national purchasing or managed care operations. We conclude the federal government has an important role to play in collaboration with others to address the issues we identified. In particular, the federal government can provide leadership to support collaborative efforts to address problems ill-suited for decentralized action.\n\nTABLE S.2\n\nOVERVIEW OF FOCUS AND PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS OF 11 INITIATIVES\n\nSource: MPR Analysis\n\na The absence of a check does not mean this was not a problem since responses were obtained in an open discussion and some features may not have been mentioned.\n\nThe report includes 10 suggestions about what HHS could do to address, in collaboration with others, the key gaps we identified through our work. These suggestions are organized into three main categories.\n\nAddressing Data Gaps on the Structure of Care. The first set of suggestions focus on better information on structure and functional linkages within the health system and their effects on the process of health care delivery. We view these needs as critical and also the most complicated HHS will face because work in this area is relatively undeveloped. We identify four priority areas for attention and suggest some ways of proceeding:\n\nIn collaboration with the NAIC and DOL, HHS should assess current activity focused on developing more consistent and complete census data on health insurance and managed care plans, with a focus on encouraging attention to needs and issues viewed as important by the health policy and research community as this activity unfolds.\n\nIn collaboration with national provider and health plan organizations and associated researchers in and out of government, HHS should determine how to capture meaningful information about linkages across entities in the health system as they form more integrated systems under managed care.\n\nReview HHS activity to collect provider information across diverse agencies with the objective of deciding change might be desirable in light of market-place change. These are generating growing interest in understanding the linkages across components of the system as well as the components themselves.\n\nReview current activity to enhance information about purchaser activity in light of needs identified through this project to determine whether current activity is sufficient to meet the needs expressed and if not, what next steps might be desirable.\n\nAddressing Data Gaps on the Process and Outcomes of Care. Our second set of suggestions\n\nfocus on better information on system operational performance and outcomes. There is considerably\n\nmore work underway in this area than the previous one both at HHS and elsewhere: The Health\n\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, in particular, has generated a host of collaborative\n\nactivity focused on standards for transaction level information. However, while these efforts may\n\npromote standardization, they are constrained if data to standardize do not exist. They also may be\n\nlimited by inherent weaknesses in understanding the structure of the health care system. For example,\n\nwhat is the universe of entities that should be coded and how? We make three suggestions for\n\nactivities that could prove useful in hastening the speed of change.\n\nTo learn from previous experience, we suggest HHS commission an independent study of the key reasons some high profile prior reports such as those by NCHS committees or IOM have spurred only limited improvements in information systems. The focus should be a practical lessons for the future about how to structure feasible and valuable recommendations and implementation strategies.\n\nConsult private-sector national associations to determine whether they perceived federal help could be useful such as, for example, in moving forward with NCQA’s recently issued “Roadmap” report on health data systems.\n\nSimilarly, consult with representatives of states, payers, purchasers and others to identify barriers to any additional areas where federal help would be useful. Facilitate communication between these entities and provider and health plan entities on areas of mutual interest in improving performance measures, including developing condition-specific measures on a population basis, tracking care across settings and associating outcomes with costs.\n\nAnticipating Strategic and Other Operational Barriers to Success. Our third and final set of suggestions focus on key strategic or procedural issues that may be impediments to improving information. Two suggestions are:\n\nHHS may want to assess where it is dependent on information obtained voluntarily through private sector entities and any risks that this may generate in a competitive marketplace.\n\nBecause public-private partnerships appear an increasingly attractive vehicle for mounting successful data initiatives in today’s environment, HHS may want to review the operational issues for government entities joining such arrangements.\n\nThe third and final suggestion focuses on the issue of funding as a constraint on data improvements. Our work shows that the funding limitations are a barrier pointed out by all stakeholders interested in enhancing data, particularly in today’s environment. In today’s federal budget climate, it is also an issue for HHS. To identify how best to enhance data given available resources, we suggest that HHS may want to consider convening a “summit” of public and foundation funders to discuss cooperative strategies that might be employed.\n\nIn sum, the information needs associated with the changing health system are extensive. Gaps in available information are widely perceived by stakeholders as impeding their ability to effectively serve their constituents. While some activity is underway to improve data and better address gaps, these activities are viewed by their sponsors as severely limited. The federal government can play an important role with stakeholders to better address the current and anticipated future information needs. While data improvement is a long term process and there are many challenges to be faced, stakeholder perceptions suggest some important areas where concrete steps can immediately be taken to begin this process.\n\nI. Introduction, Objectives, and Methods\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nThe speed and breadth of change in the health care system, along with budgetary constraints and concerns, generates intense interest in the health care system. Answers to the many questions being raised will require information on new and existing system components, the changing relationships among them, and the effects of the changes on the health care system and individuals.\n\nHHS historically has devoted fewer resources to collecting information on health insurance plans and providers--the “supply” side of the system--than it has devoted to population-based information--the “demand” side. As the health system evolves, the demand for information on the “supply” side is growing and widening, with a variety of public and private stakeholders needing information to support diverse operational concerns.\n\nThis project seeks to support the Department of Health and Human Services in identifying key information gaps created by the evolving health care system and in assessing strategic actions to address them.\n\nThe report synthesizes information obtained through a two stage process. In the first stage, we reviewed the literature and contacted more than 50 individuals by telephone to discuss their perceptions of health system change. Our discussions focused on information needs and data gaps that health system change has created, along with any activities to fill these gaps. Contacts included representatives of major national associations, providers, insurers, and health plans; state officials; foundation staff; and researchers and policy analysts. We identified 23 efforts to respond to information gaps. In the second stage, we collected comprehensive information on 11 of the 23 efforts.\n\nA. Rationale For This Work\n\nIt could be argued that there is greater instability and change in our health care system today than at any other time in the recent past. The emphasis on market competition is strong among both private and public purchasers. Managed care has become the dominant arrangement both for delivering and for financing care for privately insured individuals. It is also a growing presence in public programs like Medicaid and Medicare. At the same time, health care providers are consolidating more and more as they affiliate or merge with one another and accept greater risk and/or organizational responsibility for the delivery of care as a provider system affiliated with managed care plans. These trends, along with current budgetary constraints and concerns, are generating intense interest in the health system. Answering the vast range of questions now prompting scrutiny of the health system will require solid information about new and existing system components, the changing relationships among them, and the effects of these changes on institutions and people.\n\nAlthough the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal agencies have historically served as central repositories for population-based information nationwide, especially information from household surveys, HHS devotes many fewer resources to collecting information on health insurance plans and providers--the “supply” side of the system. Although efforts by the states and national entities like the American Medical Association (AMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) extensively complement federal efforts to collect supply side information, this decentralized structure makes it more difficult to expand the content of supply side information and make it more consistent so that it better serves current needs. By “supply side”, we refer here to information on suppliers of health care services including both institutional and individual providers and practitioners, as well as suppliers of health insurance and coverage. The focus is on information produced within the structure, contrasted with the self-reported information typically obtained in population based surveys (i.e. the demand side).\n\nAs the supply side of the health care industry evolves and information on this segment of the industry becomes more important, because of market place changes federal policymakers must consider how these developments affect information needs and how to meet these needs effectively. In addition to its direct role in producing information, HHS plays an important leadership role in the effort to identify perceived gaps in current data and other information collection efforts and to address issues common to information consumers and producers. This role may become increasingly important since changes in the health care market are expanding demand for health system information not just among policymakers but also in the private sector where timely insight on market change and performance is critical to strategic and optimal success.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop insight into how information needs associated with a changing health system are perceived by a wide variety of user groups and constituencies including those representing providers, insurers, purchasers, consumers and government at various levels. The project also identifies specific activities by a subset of those groups undertaking response to new and evolving health system information needs. With a few exceptions documented in the literature, we focus solely on non-HHS actor perceptions about information needs and their efforts to address these. Insight into these activities will complement HHS’s knowledge of its internal and other federal information needs and activities. Together, both sets of information will help HHS policymakers set priorities and develop appropriate collaborative strategies for addressing important gaps that exist or may be arising.\n\nThis project is one of several steps HHS is taking to assess the needs for better information on the health care system. The work here, which addresses information needs and gaps relating to the supply side of the health care system, is intended to support HHS’s Data Council and to complement other activities in the private sector and in other government bodies. The work also complements HHS’s recent survey integration initiative, which focused largely on population-based surveys, that is, the “demand side”. Although the supply side encompasses a range of interests, the focus here is information relevant to the health care system broadly. That is, we focus less on needs for detailed information on individual sectors of the system (e.g., specific kinds of providers, specific federal programs) than on needs for information that cross these areas and provide insight into the system more generally. For example, information pertaining to new business and structural affiliations of providers was an expressed need by various interest groups, including insurers, purchasers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers. In a few areas (e.g., purchaser-related information, expenditures), the needs are not clearly supply- or demand-related. However, we include these areas because they are both frequently overlooked and seen as very important by many of those with whom we spoke. In our view, it is valuable to include them.\n\nB. Content and Methods of This Project\n\nThis report draws on information obtained through a two-staged process we were asked to use. The first stage involved a relatively broad, but general, review of perceived information gaps and their causes across a broad spectrum of groups. In this stage, we interviewed more than 50 individuals by telephone. Interviewees included representatives of major national associations, providers, insurers, health plans, and beneficiaries; state officials; foundation staff; and researchers and policy analysts. We also selectively reviewed relevant literature and Web sites to obtain additional information on needs and existing work. These sources document (1) perceptions of health system change by various stakeholders, (2) current data systems and where they are weak or otherwise limited, and (3) efforts to fill gaps, and other related material.\n\nIn the second stage, we developed more comprehensive information on efforts by a diverse group of 11 entities to respond to information gaps they or their funders perceived. These entities were selected in consultation with staff from the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), using a number of criteria to define three priority groupings. The first was for entities engaged in broad and nationally based efforts that would have an ongoing effect on available health information. The second was for entities engaged in priority national efforts that would not necessarily have an ongoing effect, but were still of interest. The third grouping was entities engaged in efforts that were more geographically limited or not ongoing but were still of interest nationally. In this third group, we often limited our selection among entities engaged in somewhat similar activities, such as states. In all groups, we excluded entities engaged in efforts of interest to a narrower audience and set of concerns, as well as certain federal initiatives that would otherwise have been selected had they not already been well known to HHS. Efforts to collect information on these 11 entities focused on understanding the impetus/motivation, content, and perceived strengths and weaknesses of key efforts underway in response to perceived information-related needs. Our efforts included telephone contact typically with several affiliated staff and review of written material.\n\nThis paper is intended to address what we learned about specific issues and questions of concern to ASPE. It is not a summary of discrete data collection activities. That is, it synthesizes our insight across a range of information-collection efforts. We describe the context for the project in an overview of health system change and of how information needs are shaped by the responsibilities of diverse groups (Section II). We describe what we learned about the mismatch between information needs of stakeholders and current data systems (Section III). We review what we learned about current efforts to fill gaps and account for limitations with currently available data (Section IV). Finally, we assess the implications of what we learned for priorities and next steps important for HHS to consider as it addresses these issues (Section V). Supplemental material on individual efforts appears in the appendices. Appendix A includes a list of individuals interviewed, Appendix B includes citations of the most relevant written literature, Appendix C includes a list of the 11 entities and activities studied in more depth, and Appendix D includes a review of previous efforts to identify data gaps.\n\nII. Project Context: Health System Change and Stakeholder Functions\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nThere is widespread consensus among major private sector health leaders that the health care system is undergoing enormous changes. Change is driven heavily by the active role of large private purchasers in encouraging managed care and competition in an effort to contain costs. The health care system is still in transition and considerable geographic diversity is likely to remain. With health system change, the gaps in supply side data that predated these changes have only grown worse and seriously so.\n\nInformation needs of stakeholders both overlap and represent unique functions and responsibilities of diverse groups. Users of data can be thought of in terms of health care suppliers, health care customers, and the regulators/ policymakers at the federal, state and local levels.\n\nStakeholders’ needs for information can be divided into three types: (1) structural information on components of the health care system and their linkages; (2) the process of care, including administrative and clinical performance; and (3) policy relevant information on the effects of structure and process on policy-relevant outcomes and the implications both generally and for distinct constituencies.\n\nVirtually all those we interviewed expressed a sense of the enormity of change in the marketplace and the span of its effects. There is wide agreement that the serious gaps in supply side data that predated these changes have only grown worse and seriously so. As Joseph Newhouse, chair of the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, observed in our conversation, “Where isn’t there a data gap?”\n\nThe context for this paper is the existing work on changes in the health system. We review these changes, as well as information users and groups, and the current health system information needed to meet the functional responsibilities of the groups. However, while functional responsibilities vary by user group, we identified many information needs that are common to all groups. Recognizing user perspectives helped us identify in our interviews why groups expressed specific data needs, even when the interviewee did not explicitly describe how their organizations’ functional responsibilities fueled their health system data needs and many of the needs served multiple functions and overlapping user communities.\n\nA. Health Care System Change as Viewed by Stakeholders\n\nImportant changes in the health care system are being tracked by the Center for Studying Health System Change, established and funded expressly for this purpose by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Center staff recently summarized what they learned in interviews with top leaders in 15 national professional organizations and trade associations about the changes underway in the health system and the efforts of their members to adapt (Corrigan and Ginsburg 1997). We summarize below the major findings they reported.\n\nCenter staff identified five themes running through the interviews which they published in Health Affairs: (1) large private purchasers heavily influence change by their efforts to slow the rising cost of health care but change also reflects fundamental shifts in medical practice and in the use of technology; (2) the health care system is still in transition, and the considerable geographical diversity in markets is likely to remain; (3) the system simultaneously is experiencing positive change with the growth of managed care and competitive markets (e.g., care coordination and increasing clinical and operational efficiencies) and adverse effects (e.g., siphoning of dollars to investors); (4) the system still faces fundamental problems, such as the large uninsured population, and potential new problems, such as erosion of the clinical foundation of care as reflected in the doctor-patient relationship; and (5) the majority of leaders perceive that reliance on marketplace dynamics should continue, since efforts at federal health reform in their perception failed dismally.\n\nCenter staff also reported that different stakeholders have both similar and different concerns. Among purchasers, large employers are much more active than small or medium-size employers in pushing change, and national/regional companies differ from local business coalitions in their interest in practice standardization versus community-based improvements. Purchasers and consumers are frustrated about the limitations in comparative data on health plan performance and outcomes. Insurers and health plans are enthusiastic about managed care’s potential value, particularly in forming a clinical information infrastructure to enhance health outcomes. But insurers and plans also feel challenged to develop stable relationships with physicians. Hospital concerns are shaped by the extensive horizontal integration and downsizing occurring in different ways in a variety of markets and industry segments. Academic medical centers are concerned about how core functions (education, research, and patient care) are challenged by the competition introduced by managed care that is reducing the ability to cross-subsidize. Physicians and other provider groups perceive that there is a movement into multi-specialty group practice that is better able to invest in infrastructure and share risk. They also perceive the role of practice management companies to be increasing and they are concerned about the effects of capitation. That is, increasing consolidation within the system is leading to new organizations involved in managing health care as well as arrangements that involve physicians in the risk for the cost of care.\n\nAccording to Center staff analysis of their interviews, the future system envisioned by leaders includes large national organizations and smaller market players, and insurer- and provider-sponsored entities. The interviews also suggest that there are pressure points throughout the system. These include the uninsured, underinsured, and safety net providers; the elderly and the disabled and how they are integrated into managed care; and the potential erosion of public confidence in the health care system. These pressure points show how system change affects people and entities of different types and with different policy interests. Demand for information from consumers is perceived to be growing, though serious limitations exist in available information.\n\nThe perceptions Center staff identified with association leaders are consistent with prominent academic and popular perceptions elsewhere in the literature. For example, a 1996 Business and Health summary of the state of the American health care system highlights the shift from inpatient to ambulatory care settings, the massive economic reconfiguration of the health system as a function of hospital downsizing and emerging oligopolies like Columbia/HCA, and changes in academic medical centers. The summary also includes a managed care perspective arguing for the importance of data to monitor and improve provider performance in a managed care environment (Halvorson in Business and Health 1996). The perceptions of Wall Street health security analysts also parallel the perceptions of others. They predict continued rapid growth of managed care and greater development of physician organizations; however, they see hospitals remaining a key and powerful player, with the nonprofit sector continuing to have considerable community-based and political support (Ginsburg and Grossman 1995; Center panel 1997). Miller and Luft (1994), Gold et al. (1995), and Gold and Hurley (1997) highlight the considerable complexity in emerging managed care models and products. For example, managed care plans offer multiple products, their provider networks are structured in complex ways, provider entities are given major responsibility for managed care functions, and there is considerable variation in all of this across markets. Finally, the proliferation of products (e.g., HMOs, PPOs, and point-of-service products) with similar brand names but sometimes different features lead to further confusion and complexity.\n\nSimilar trends are perceived to exist outside the acute-care sector. For example, Kane (1995) notes the blurring distinction between home and institutional care and between providers in these two areas. Shaughnessy et al. (1995) observes the growing interest in outcomes and effectiveness of such care in diverse settings when needs are growing and costs are a concern. Freeman and Trabin (1994) highlight the use of firms that provide “carved-out” managed behavioral health care in contemporary models of managed mental health care delivery. These entities often represent new structures that are influencing patient flow and delivery of care.\n\nB. Where Does the Demand for Information Come From?\n\nFor analytical purposes, it is possible to identify and functionally differentiate three key health system user groups: (1) provider and health plan/insurer associations and the suppliers they represent, (2) purchaser and consumer organizations and the customers they represent, and (3) regulators/policymakers. The information needs of these groups share many common features but the uses of information also differ, consistent with differences in function and responsibility for each group. Analytically, three kinds of information needs can be distinguished: (1) structure and components of the health system, (2) operational information on the process of care, and (3) outcome information (including both clinical and policy outcome) to guide policy analysis and representation. The functional categories of data requirements encompass the range of data needs expressed by those we spoke with over the course of the project. The three user types were grouped based on shared perspectives and motivations that drive their information requirements.\n\nProviders and health plans/insurer associations and their members represent suppliers of health care services. They include, for example, the American Medical Association (AMA), American Hospital Association (AHA), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Association of Health Plans (AAHP), the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAMSA) and Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA). These entities also tend to be membership organizations, which need information to support themselves and the needs of their members. In contrast, purchaser and consumer entities such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), and Pacific Business Group on Health, represent the demand side of the market, that is, the customers. Policymakers and regulators are responsible for defining the “rules of the game” and providing oversight for the market. This diverse group includes federal, state, and local policy-formulating bodies, regulators, and program administrators. We also include here those involved in developing information needed to support these functions, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or various research or foundation entities.\n\nThere is considerable variation within and overlap between each of these user groups (e.g., when government acts as the purchaser for its employees or for public programs). Functional responsibilities also shift over time. For example, the reliance on market-based solutions means that purchasers, through the choices they make, are increasingly, if not always explicitly, influencing health care policy formulation.\n\nThe first informational category encompasses functions which directly require structural descriptive information on the components of the health care system. That is, there is the need to know what entities exist, what their characteristics are, and how they are changing. Provider and insurer associations are paid dues to represent a segment of the industry. Hence, they need information to understand their share of the industry and membership base, to project revenue, and to assess potentially desirable changes in their membership eligibility qualifications. For example, with the growth of managed care products, these users would want to know which entities are eligible to join a managed care association and which products and members should be counted for purposes of dues assessment. The suppliers these groups represent need information to identify trends that may affect their strategic decisions as well as to carry out more operating needs (like contracting). Regulators and health policymakers typically need the same kinds of information as provider and insurers on components of the health system, but their focus is on assessing available resources and entities for whom they are accountable. For example, they would want to know which entities are subject to state insurance oversight. Purchasers and consumers also need information on components of the health system to support their operational needs, as discussed below.\n\nAll three entities need operational information on the process of care, particularly information related to performance in both administrative and clinical areas that are relevant to them or their constituency. Provider and insurer associations are expected by their members to provide operational support in terms of measuring and benchmarking performance and developing standardized information such as that used to support clinical practice. For example, members may want to know how their hospitals days per 1,000 covered lives compare to that of peers. Purchaser and consumer organizations are expected to inform or carry out group purchasing activities and help consumers participate more knowledgeably in the system. To do this, they may want to know what choices are available and how each health insurance option performs on such measures as cost, consumer satisfaction, or quality. Regulators and policymakers are expected to monitor performance and provide general oversight. They also have certain regulatory and administrative functions over components of the health system. Therefore, they need enough information to assess and provide feedback on overall performance and improvements. They also need enough information to identify potential problems early on so that steps can be taken to avoid them or to minimize their impact.\n\nAll three users are involved in policy analysis to encourage the development of policies that are responsive to the concerns of their particular constituency or interests. The range of policy analysis issues is broad but tends to correspond to understanding the effects of structure and process on policy-relevant outcomes and what both the policy implications and the implications for constituents are. This generates a need for various kinds of information that could be used to assess how constituents will be affected by particular policy options, to support the development of association positions, or to inform members so that they may position themselves and develop individual positions on issues. For example, has proposed changes in Medicare capitation rates that would reduce rate calculations by the exclusion of indirect payments for graduate medical education. Health plan and provider associations need to know the county-specific impacts of these changes so they can identify effects on markets important to their members; purchasers and consumers are concerned with overall fiscal and geographic impacts specific to their reference population; and government policymakers need information to help them both estimate the budgetary effects of the change overall and assess where to fine tune policy to minimize any adverse short-term impacts of rate reductions.\n\nAll these groups also represent and advocate--either for a specific constituency or for their associated public policy body. This representation function differs from policy development in that it is oriented more toward supporting an already formulated position and less toward developing that position. Such support requires information that helps to make the case for the organizations’ positions and purpose, including information that would be used to educate policymakers and the public. Such information is needed both at the national level and at the state or locality level where such issues often get considered.\n\nIII. Perceived Mismatches Between Information Needs and Available Information\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nHealth information needs can be classified into three main types: (1) components and structure of the system (that is, inputs to care), (2) operational process and performance features, and (3) the policy-relevant outcomes of health care delivery. Historically, more information has been collected on structure and resources, with less captured on both operational process and outcomes, particularly in the ambulatory settings. However gaps exist within each of the three major types of health information needs.\n\nPeriodic reviews of the adequacy of available information have highlighted data gaps, including some of those we identify here. In particular, these reviews have highlighted the limitations in complete and standardized transaction level information on encounters or services, in the capture of clinically meaningful data elements, and in the development of outcomes information.\n\nWhat appears new in this evolving environment is: (1) the need for information on the structure of the health system and the linkages among its components; (2) the limitations in process data on operational performance or outcomes and in the ability to link it to particular accountable entities, geographic divisions, subpopulations, or similar health plans/providers; (3) the erosion of transaction or service data due to the growth of managed care and self-insurance; and (4) the increasing concern about data gaps by a wide variety of stakeholders due to the perception of increasingly competitive markets.\n\nStakeholders identified a number of critical questions they were unable to answer given the absence of better and more complete data. To answer their questions, better information is needed on the ways provider entities are linked to health plans and integrated systems and the arrangements through which these linkages are defined. There also needs to be better transaction and service level data, with appropriate clinical detail and structural links to support analysis of operational performance and outcomes.\n\nNational data are not sufficient in today’s environment. The stakeholders we interviewed perceive a need for information at the state and local market levels. Further, they want data to be flexible enough to support diverse analyses and timely enough to be relevant when the health care system is changing rapidly.\n\nThe information needs of different users are much the same, and so the same information may meet a variety of functional uses at any given time and across time. We first provide a context for a discussion of new and emerging health system information needs by reviewing the current types and sources of supply side information and how they have been assessed. We then assess current health system issues and outstanding supply side information needs. The information in this section is based on interviews, documents, and other materials reviewed for this project.\n\nConsistent with the earlier discussion, we classify health information needs into three main types: (1) components and structure of the system (that is, inputs to care), (2) operational process and performance features, and (3) the policy relevant outcomes of health care delivery. Historically, the greatest amount of information has been collected on structure and resource issues, with less known about both outcomes and operational process, particularly in the ambulatory care setting. However, gaps exist within each of the three major types of health information needs. To identify such gaps, we subclassify information needs within each category into discrete types of issues or concerns relevant to that category. We also review the issues and needs that cut across categories, and we conclude with a summary of key gaps identified.\n\nA. Historical Context for Available Information and New Information Needs\n\n1. Where Has Information Come From?\n\nThough the health care system is complex, current sources of information correspond to the three types of data needs previously discussed: health resources and structure, (inputs from facilities, providers, insurer/payer coverage vehicles), indicators of the process of care (utilization of discrete services) and--least commonly--outcomes of care (spending, clinical outcomes). Within each data need category, the information now collected, reflecting the current emphasis in health data, is considerably narrower in scope than current users demand.\n\nAs reflected in Table 1, information on health resources and structures is typically divided between health provider and health insurer data. Health provider data are based largely on inventories or files from health care facilities and various types of providers. These files are maintained in federal agencies and in various provider associations. States keep such information on facilities and providers subject to their licensing provisions and sometimes for a broader set of facilities or providers. For the most part, these data relate to discrete entities or individual providers -- information on their characteristics or relationships with one another is limited.\n\nHealth agencies or associations have not traditionally been very involved in maintaining data on health insurers and managed care entities. State insurance departments keep such data for insurers or HMOs subject to their licensure requirements. Inventories also are maintained centrally by trade associations and research or consulting firms. Industry data from the Department of Commerce can sometimes provide insight into particular issues of interest.\n\nInformation on the process of care is based mainly on discharge/encounter-level data for institutional services (hospital discharges, nursing home stays), with some limited data collection from institutional providers of ambulatory care (outpatient facilities, home health agencies) and--to an even lesser extent--office-based practice. Payers also may have data from claims that can support analysis, though this is much more likely to be the case for public programs (Medicare and, to an extent, Medicaid) than for private insurers. HHS, states, and national provider associations each maintain specific kinds of information. The only information on utilization provided distinctly for individual insurers or payers comes from state filings of utilization and financial information by insurers and HMOs, and from evolving “report card”-type efforts reflected in HEDIS 3.0 reporting.\n\nThe latter involves aggregate reporting for plans or other entities rather than the development of patient-level databases. Proprietary data of various types are marketed by consulting firms to meet the operational or other needs of purchasers, providers, or health plans, particularly in the interest of benchmarking. However, proprietary data tend to be expensive and not publicly available.\n\nInformation on outcomes of the system are quite limited. For the most part, outcomes are derived analytically from process data. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) maintains national health account information with aggregate spending by provider and payer type. The agency has recently expanded the estimates of provider and payer expenditures to the state level. Personlevel data on discharges and encounters can support some limited outcomes analysis. Provider data collected as an adjunct to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey can do the same. Vital statistics data also may be used in outcome studies, as may other population data, all of which are outside the scope of inquiry here.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nILLUSTRATIVE CURRENT MAJOR SOURCES OF\n\nSUPPLY-SIDE INFORMATION BY TYPE\n\n2. How Good Has the Information Been?\n\nPeriodic reviews have been conducted to develop information and/or consensus on the adequacy of available information. Federal data, more than state data, have been subject to review, although there is some information on state data. Reports assessing data collected by private-sector groups are less likely to be publicly available. Most assessments preceded the current marketplace changes and addressed specific kinds of data for which agencies had defined accountability. This limits the comprehensiveness of the scope of the efforts. The most relevant assessments we found are from the periodic reports issued by the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), the typically more broad-based and topical studies funded through the Institute of Medicine (IOM), contracted studies of health expenditure accounts, and foundation-funded studies of state health data. We review each of these briefly below; Appendix D includes a fuller discussion of these historical assessments.\n\nNCVHS Reports. Standing committees established for advising National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) data collection activities have issued periodic reports, which tend to be technical in focus. The most relevant is a recent report (US DHHS 1996) recommending a standardized set of health data elements for capturing person- and encounter-level information. The impetus for NCVHS’s work is a concern about the administrative burden of inconsistency in data collection and reporting activities and about the confusion generated by lack of standardized health data definitions. NCVHS efforts to develop standardized person- and encounter-level data do not appear to have focused on the impact of the changing marketplace on individual data elements. For example, the payer and charge information included is relatively traditional and fee-for-service based.\n\nInstitute of Medicine. The IOM has convened panels to study a number of issues related to health data, one of which we highlight here (See Appendix D for more details and additional studies). With funding from NCHS, the IOM issued a report in 1992 that evaluated NCHS’s planned National Health Survey, which would integrate the four health provider surveys with the National Health Interview Survey. The IOM concluded that current systems are uncoordinated and although duplicative at times, they also suffer from important gaps. The IOM cited four areas for priority attention: (1) better insurance claims data, especially for the under-65 population, for the fee-forservice and the prepaid capitated sector; (2) more information on clinical services and physiologic outcomes from medical records; (3) more information from patients (or proxies) on quality of life, health status, and satisfaction with care; and (4) better information on how much is spent (directly and indirectly, including out-of-pocket expenses) on treating particular types of patients. In our view, the IOM recommendations focus mostly on the need for person-level information to support public policy. They focused less on private sector needs for institutional-level data and data needs of specific health interests. Many of those we spoke with in the private sector wanted more information in the structural arrangements of the health sector on operational performance.\n\nNational Health Expenditures. HCFA and others have sponsored work on issues relating the needs for information about health accounts of expenditures. Haber and Newhouse (1991) discuss emerging issues and review existing revisions to the accounts such as to better estimate out-of-pocket spending directly. They also highlight the growing prevalence of vertical integration and managed care, which creates a need for classifications of expenditures that are more responsive to type of service than type of provider. Self-insurance is flagged as a potential threat to the quality and completeness of data on private insurers. Genuardi, Stiller, and Trapnell (1996) consider expenditure data for the prescription drug sector, pointing out changes in the industry with managed care that influence data needs. Ginsburg and Pickereign (1996) assess the policy utility and quality of data used to track health care costs. The authors compare the quality and utility of three kinds of data: provider data on revenues or costs, claims data from insurers, and premium data from employees.\n\nState Data. Long, Marquis, and Rogers (1995) focus on states priorities for state health expenditure data. Gold, Burnbauer, and Chu (1995/1996, 1995) report on a 1994 telephone survey that asked state officials about their perception of data needs and weaknesses. The findings show low levels of policymakers’ confidence in the ability to address emerging, but priority, health issues with existing data. Major gaps in data include health expenditures (particularly for expenditures in the private sector and outside of institutions) and on health system and health plan performance. The major barriers to improving the data include funding shortages, lack of comparability across datasets, and the unwillingness of providers and insurers to submit needed data.\n\nB. Assessing Emerging Issues and Needs: Health Care Structure\n\nThe structure of the health care system reflects the individual providers as well as how they are organized and linked together as a delivery and financing system, and how well they are linked across the continuum of care. In addition, the number and kinds of physicians in practice reflects the time lag associated between provider training and actual practice. Thus, we include issues associated with planning for needed resources as part of the section on inputs (structure) of care systems. For the same reason, we include issues associated with the available financial resources to support this structure and future training needs (for example, insurance premiums). In discussing these issues, we review their associated information needs and data gaps as viewed from the information obtained in this study.\n\n1. Structure I: Providers, Linkages, Continuum of Care\n\nMost of the current information on the structure of the health system is oriented toward the counting of the individual types of resources (like providers, facilities or health plans) that make up the structure. In contrast, our project showed that there is a need for information that would allow one to interpret the adequacy or change in these resources and to better understand the relationships of these resources both to one another and to the current financing system. (See Table 2 for illustrative questions gathered in the project.)\n\nTABLE 2\n\nQUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTING DATA GAPS: STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS\n\nON RESOURCES AND STRUCTURE I\n\nA. Physicians and Other Individual Providers\n\nIs the nature of a “doctor” changing from entrepreneur to employee--Who is buying and selling practices, with what deals and effects? How is the form of practice changing?\n\nWhat is the meaningful bed capacity taking staffing levels into account?\n\nWhat is the right benchmark for assessing change in hospital staffing?\n\nHow is the nature of a “hospital” changing as it develops linkages with other parts of the system and what are these linkages (e.g. how many different arrangements do hospitals have with physicians, what types of arrangements).\n\nWhat changes are occurring in the nature of retail outlets for pharmaceuticals?\n\nWhat is the role of mid-level providers, how is it changing, and how can we describe “other professionals” meaningfully?\n\nB. Linkages Between Providers, Facilities, and Health Plans\n\nHow can we get consistent and meaningful information on the number and characteristics of health plans in different markets?\n\nWhat is really driving market level differences in managed care penetration? For example, what role do employer coalitions play?\n\nHow can one assess whether provider networks are “adequate”? What does a staffing ratio mean? What is the capacity of a given system? Is there genuine access? Is red-lining occurring in some low income or minority areas?\n\nWhat is the downstream financial risk? How much risk is being transferred from purchaser to plan to provider? Who actively bears the risk and under which arrangements?\n\nWhat does ownership in systems really mean (e.g. real systems versus purchased assets, what are affiliations)?\n\nWhat should the unit be for accreditation? For example, there are nested entities and many parts in each entity. What is a taxonomy for classifying and which should be used?\n\nWhat are the fixed versus variable costs of different structures and what does this imply for consolidation?\n\nIs there really a trend toward horizontal networking of providers (e.g. particular specialists?)\n\nC. Integration of Acute Care and Long Term Care\n\nHow can we best track the newer kinds of long term care institutions, like assisted living or domiciliary care? What segment of the market are they serving?\n\nHow should we integrate community based care and institutional long term care?\n\nWhat are the implications of developing new services like sub-ealite care?\n\nPhysicians and Other Individual Providers. Interest in the structural changes in physician and hospital practice and in how these practices overlap is growing. With respect to resources, for example, those concerned with physicians are interested in understanding how the concept of “doctor” changes as physician practices are bought and group practice grows. In an era of concern about costs and downsizing, there is great interest in knowing the actual bed capacity of the system and the best way to assess the “adequacy” of hospital staffing. For example, when workers are being laid off, it would be useful to have information on what a quality though still “lean and mean” system looks like, and on the difference between this and situations that threaten patient care. These kinds of questions, common to providers and policy makers, are hard to answer when existing systems provide limited information on the characteristics of physician practice and the structural features of provider organizations. Similarly, the absence of information linking resources to performance makes interpretation of physician practice difficult.\n\nThe competitive marketplace is altering the nature of existing provider relationships as well as the players and their roles. Those representing hospitals, for example, are most interested in understanding how the nature of a “hospital” is changing with the shift from the provision of inpatient services to broader systems of care with potentially more formal physician affiliations. Those representing mid-level providers or “other” professionals want better data on these human resources to understand how their roles are changing. For example, are they being used more or less, and by whom? It is impossible to know this when existing data systems capture only information on individual entities and not what they do, and when the categories and types of information captured are not consistent across providers or settings that may substitute for one another.\n\nManaged care also is changing the provider mix. For example, retail outlets for pharmaceuticals now include larger roles for mail order and managed pharmaceutical practices. This change creates a need to capture more data if users are to continue to get accurate information on the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nLinkages Between Providers, Facilities, and Health Plans. With respect to structure, our interviews revealed that the most pressing need is for better information on the linkages between providers, facilities, and health plans. The existing information in this area is highly limited. One key gap is the absence of consistent and meaningful information on the number and characteristics of health plans in different markets. While there is some information on HMOs, the information available on other managed care entities is inconsistent, and there is limited information as on which entities serve which markets and to what extent. The absence of such information also makes it difficult to obtain information on other aspects of managed care delivery, which are of key interest. For instance, there is a need for better insight into the adequacy of provider networks when staffing ratios are inadequate and into how to capture, describe, and assess the transfer of risk downstream. The consolidation of providers is also raising other questions. For example, how can structure be understood when parts of the health care system are related to each other through contracts as well as ownership, and through overlapping relationships among associated entities like the hospital, hospital system, and associated physician organizations that may represent primary care physicians, distinct specialties, and other groups? How does one answer such questions when there is often not a list from which to sample, and when it is not clear who can provide what, or when what is provided may be changing over time. We identified some efforts to develop frameworks to support this kind of data collection by researchers like Gloria Bazzoli and Steve Shortell, James Robinson and Harry Castalino, Jeffrey Alexander, and Marsha Gold. However, the activities were at a very early stage and oriented more toward theoretical constructs than ongoing data collection needs.\n\nIntegration of Acute and Long-Term Care. The movement to managed care and competition creates the most pressing information needs for the acute care sector. For long-term care, however, developments in the market create a need for a different but analogous kind of information. For instance, most of the historical information on long-term care is specific to institutions. However, the emergence of assisted living facilities and other new types of long-term care, along with a growing emphasis on community-based care, have caused a shift in the marketplace. There is therefore a pressing need for information on the causes and nature of this shift if we are to address immediate long-term care issues in the appropriate context. In addressing the information needs unique to each sector of care, we must also consider the fact that acute and long-term care are part of the same continuum, and that market forces that shape the former will also affect the latter. For instance, the managed care arrangements that continue to define and redefine the system of acute care will also influence how this type of care is received by people in long-term care. As a result, we can expect there to be a growing need for information on the implications of the relationships between these two systems of care, although this need was not made explicit in our interviews. A key example of the significance of this relationship is the emerging work designed to understand how to construct managed care systems that are sensitive to the chronic care needs of those served by Medicaid. These efforts will require considerably more information than we now have on non-institutional providers of long-term care and their relationships to each other and to the acute care sector.\n\n2. Structure II: Resources -- Training and Financing\n\nInformation on resources involves questions and concerns that are central to the development and financing of the system and its components over time (see Table 3 for illustrative issues). Interviewees were especially concerned about training for providers, especially physicians, given the fact that there is already an oversupply nationwide. Many variables that both influence future training needs and the ability to project these needs are not captured well by existing data systems. For example, are physicians responding to economic circumstances by shifting their practice (e.g., from specialty care to primary care), and what does this imply for future physicians and their training needs? Without consistent data on characteristics and content of medical practice, it is difficult to assess this issue. How are primary care training needs and the challenges they create being met in light of the move to ambulatory care-based delivery and training? Do we have systems to even benchmark the extent of these changes? How do we capture outpatient training in different settings and who should collect this information? What do we know about the current providers of training: how is training and funding being influenced by market change? In an era of concern over cost, how can the relative performance of the many different residency programs be assessed? Capturing information on the financing and outputs of medical education has always been complex because of the multiple entities, cross-subsidies, and joint products involved. The limitations these factors create for analysis become more of a concern in the policy environment and for academic medical center operational planning in an era of managed care growth and increased competition.\n\nConcerns about the financing of care are related to gaps in how resource data on the health industry is captured. There is a need for information on the increasingly influential role of employers in the health care system. What are employers doing? What incentives for action are they facing in terms of trends in insurance premiums? There is also a need for information on the role of consumer financing. How much are consumers paying out of pocket, and how and why is this changing? Estimating consumer spending has always been a problem, and it is becoming more complicated as patient spending becomes partly influenced by choices they make among the great variety of health care options that involve variable in- and out-of- network charges. As states grow more dominant in formulating health policy, what interstate transfers in spending exist? What capital needs do providers face for diverse investments, especially when the providers or the intended uses of capital are ill-suited to equity markets? Do we even know how much is spent on biomedical research and other forms of nonpersonal health spending and who is doing the spending? This question may be important if the funding comes from cross-subsidies of patient care that may be tightening.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nQUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTING DATA GAPS: STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS ON\n\nRESOURCES AND STRUCTURE II\n\nA.

Financing of Care\n\nWhat are the trends in insurance premiums?\n\nWhat role are employers of different types and sizes playing alone or individually to influence the financing and structure of care?\n\nWhat is the size of the health care industry and employment base?\n\nHow much are consumers spending out of pocket, is it increasing and why?\n\nWhat is the size and nature of interstate transfers in spending?\n\nHow much capital is needed, by who and for what, particularly by those outside equity markets?\n\nHow much are we spending on biomedical research and other forms of nonpersonal health care spending?\n\n*The focus on questions of physical training reflects the current focus of the health care system and could\n\nchange in the future.\n\nC. Assessing Issues and Needs: Operational Performance and the Process of Health Care Coverage and Delivery\n\nThe issues and needs associated with the process of care can be classified in three categories: (1) better knowledge of the structure of and responsibility for the process of care, (2) the determinants of the process of care, and (3) the efficiency of the process of care both generally and relatively across participants. Table 4 summarizes the key needs and data gaps in these areas as expressed by interviewees.\n\nThese issues stem, in part, from a need to understand how the delivery of care is actually structured and who is responsible for it in a system increasingly dominated by managed care and other more integrated systems in a competitive marketplace. Changes such as these are affecting the care that providers can deliver and patients can receive and how much it costs. Each type of provider wants to understand how its segment of the market is being influenced operationally, financially, and philosophically by the changes. Policymakers and consumers share these concerns. For example, who actually chooses the care that is received (the physician, physician group, health plan, or administrators), and how does this factor influence doctor-patient relationships for those participating? Thus, knowing what arrangements are in place and how they influence the process of care is of growing interest to a variety of stakeholders. Another issue is how to assess efficiency in a market in which performance has become more of a concern. These concerns extend beyond general public policy to the specific constituencies that may stand to gain or lose if they are regarded as more or less efficient or a better or worse performer. For example, are teaching hospitals really more costly when their costs are appropriately adjusted for the mix of care and then compared?\n\nTABLE 4\n\nQUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTING DATA GAPS: STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS ON\n\nTHE PROCESS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND DELIVERY\n\nA. Structure and Responsibility for Process of Care\n\nHow do consumers actually make decisions in selecting health plans? What information on such issues as medical compensation and effects do consumers want and how do we get it?\n\nIs there considerable churning across health plans, especially in Medicaid?\n\nHow does managed care really work (e.g. marketing, enrollment and other administrative functions; contracting; medical management and clinical delivery)? How does it vary in different kinds of systems?\n\nAre provider sponsored plans really clinically integrated and to what extent are they assuming the insurance function as well (or forming consortia with payers)?\n\nWho is actually delivering care, for example, what role do mid level providers play?\n\nWhat are the changing roles of providers in primary and specialty care?\n\nIs physician use becoming more differentiated between in hospital providers and ambulatory care providers?\n\nWhat structures are used in carve-out arrangements and what effects do they really have on the process of care delivery?\n\nHow do we assess if there is a seamless continuum of care in existence?\n\nB. Determinants of Process of Care\n\nDo physicians and other providers actually know or understand the contractual arrangements under which they function? What effect do these arrangements have on physicians and other providers and how they practice?\n\nWhat changes are occurring in how providers and patients communicate?\n\nHow do providers decide on care, for example, what role do practice guidelines or profiling play?\n\nHow does managed care deal specifically with aspects of care, like home health care?\n\nWhat use is being made of new technologies coming on line?\n\nAt the enterprise level (for example, an integrated system or plan), how can we assess malpractice experience and liability?\n\nC. Efficiency of Process of Care\n\nWhich medical practices perform better, e.g., in terms of productivity or costeffectiveness so providers get feedback and use it to improve performance?\n\nWhat are useful benchmarks for financial, quality, and operational performance?\n\nWhere does managed care actual performance compare against its theoretical potential to enhance coordination of care and preventive activity and to eliminate “fat” (unnecessary care and administrative costs) from the system?\n\nWhat are the effects of changes in provider roles and responsibilities in care?\n\nHow do AMCs compare to other hospitals in financial and quality indicators? Similarly, how do other subsets of hospitals, e.g. public hospitals, rural hospitals) or types of providers (for profit versus nonprofit etc) compare?\n\n1. Structure and Responsibility for Process of Care\n\nExisting data systems provide little insight into which health plans even operate, let alone how they do so and what this implies for the various actors in the system. Thus, a high priority for many different entities is information that would shed light on these issues and on what they mean for a diverse variety of functions these entities perform.\n\nFor example, if “health plan selection” is a key driver of competitive markets, how do consumers choose, what information do they want and get, what choices do they make, and how stable are their choices? This kind of information affects purchasers/consumers as well as providers and health plans that want to position themselves in the market. The information, typically based on market research, has implications for plans, for example, who want to strategically plan and market their products.\n\nSimilarly, there is considerable interest in knowing how managed care actually works both administratively and clinically, how this varies across systems, and how plans and providers interact with one another. There are related concerns for what managed care means for the operation of provider systems. What role do provider-sponsored entities actually play? Are primary care and specialty care roles changing? How do carve-out arrangements in managed care influence the process through which care is delivered and how coordinated is it from the point of view of health systems, the provider, or the participant? Information on all these issues can help entities understand how they and their constituencies may be affected by change or what effects can be anticipated.\n\n2. Determinants of the Process of Care\n\nThis set of concerns involves information that would improve the understanding of how the process of care is ultimately determined. Although structural arrangements may be in place, their influence could depend on whether or how they are understood by physicians and other providers, and on how the providers respond. Structural arrangements may also influence the nature of the provider-patient relationship and process of care. Specific kinds of structural features (e.g., practice guidelines, profiling) are being developed, and there is interest in their effects. Similarly, both consumers with particular health needs and providers focused on serving them are interested in how managed care influences use of provider services. More broadly, there is a concern for knowing the actual use that is made of new technology, since this may influence practice and expenditures. There also is interest in how situations like malpractice can be assessed at the enterprise level rather than just the provider level when managed care and integrated systems are growing. But existing systems do not capture these features of care or the use of particular technologies in a consistent and timely basis.\n\n3. Efficiency in the Process of Care\n\nIn a competitive marketplace, provider groups want better information on how they perform relative to their competition. This may be providers like them (e.g., other group practices) or other entities (e.g., academic medical centers or public hospitals). Purchasers also want to compare performance of plans on various measures of financial, quality, or operational performance, as reflected in the development of HEDIS 3.0 and other report-card measures. A variety of stakeholders want to understand how managed care entities perform relative to their theoretical potential to encourage coordination of care, preventative care, clinical integration, and system efficiency. These needs for information require encounters/ transaction-level data at the service level that can be captured consistently across entities and providers, and that can be manipulated to create plan-, provider-, and population-based estimates.\n\nD. Assessing Issues and Needs: Outcomes of Delivery and Policy\n\nInformation on outcomes of the health care system have historically been among the least developed. In today’s environment, this kind of information is increasingly valued both by those concerned with assessing the value of care and by those concerned with understanding its costs and distributional implications. Table 5 summarizes questions in each of these areas that were raised in our interviews.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nQUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTING DATA GAPS: STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS ON OUTCOMES OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY\n\nA. Appropriateness of Care and Clinical Outcomes\n\nWho is controlling the process of care and are the entities doing it doing an appropriate job or are they too restrictive?\n\nHow can we assess changes in performance by distinguishing between effects of changes in medical practice versus access?\n\nWhat are the clinical outcomes of care? the risk adjusted outcomes?\n\nWhat are the resources that contribute to these outcomes? That is, how much is spent for given outcomes or types of patients or effects?\n\nHow do consumers assess outcomes of care in making decisions, considering appropriateness, cost, perceptions, etc.?\n\nB. Costs of Care\n\nIs bigger better in terms of the scale of enterprise?\n\nWhat resources are devoted to ambulatory care?\n\nHow much is spent on physician care? on provider subgroups?\n\nTo what extent are system savings a one time only savings versus continuing savings? A function of price discounts or real changes in the mix, intensity, or quality of care? Have we now gone beyond the fat to the meat in cutting costs?\n\nC. Population-Based Access and Distribution\n\nHow will we know if people are being squeezed out of the system? For example, what about the homeless? How do we interpret bad debt?\n\nCan we assume people get needed care once they are insured and affiliated with a provider?\n\nWhat is the value (community benefit) of a nonprofit institution or system?\n\nWhat is the relationship between managed care and the public health infrastructure?\n\n1. Appropriateness of Care and Clinical Outcomes\n\nA key set of outcomes-related concerns has to do with how to interpret practice. For example, is a C-section rate too high or too low when it falls or is below average? Some standard for comparison or form of analysis is needed to interpret change. For example, if care processes are subject to strict clinical and utilization management oversight is this appropriate or too restrictive? That is, what is the relationship between care process and outcome? When is medical practice becoming more appropriate of efficient, and when is needed access being denied? Change threatens historical expectations and established practice. Each stakeholder is affected and these effects influence funding streams. Sorting out efficiency from eroding quality becomes critical to a public policy debate involving all stakeholders and a substantial portion of the Gross Domestic Product. Without better and more comprehensive measures of appropriate care and cost-effective care, it will be difficult to address these questions and to separate out individual interests from broader public policy concerns.\n\nJust having outcome information is another concern. What are the outcomes and how much does each cost? How can they be compared on a risk-adjusted basis so health plans or providers can be equitably assessed relative to others? What outcomes do consumers value, and how can this information be fed into decision-making? Again, consistent and flexible transactions/encounter level data on services is needed to support such studies, and the data have to include, if they are to be useful, those population- and provider-based variables needed for adjustment or manipulation.\n\n2. Costs of Care\n\nThere is considerable interest in understanding cost trends, particularly with the shift toward managed care and more ambulatory based delivery using competitive models. Current spending categories provide limited insight on key questions. For example, consolidation is occurring with managed care, but existing systems provide only limited information that can be used to assess whether bigger scale is more efficient. Because spending data has been captured by setting rather than service, there are considerable barriers to assessing the extent of change. The development of capitated systems will make these gaps even larger to the extent that it leads to an erosion of data previously collected centrally to support fee-for-service billing. For example, if one wants to estimate resources devoted to ambulatory care, the fact that resources for hospital outpatient services are included in total hospital spending is a key gap in creating estimates of ambulatory spending. Capitated arrangements may make it more difficult to isolate spending on physicians, an issue of concern to those representing physicians, interested in how much is spent for their services. More generally, there is limited information that could be used to assess the effects of managed care on costs and how this may change over time, since neither costs nor characteristics of managed care are captured on any consistent, comprehensive, or timely basis. While this is a public policy issue, it is also of great concern to both providers or health plans with a stake in particular approaches, and to purchasers who want to “buy right.”\n\n3. Population-Based Information on Access and Distribution\n\nThe shifts in the system are generating needs for population-based information about access and distribution. A key concern of a number of groups and individuals we interviewed involves whether one could be confident that existing information would show whether individuals are being squeezed out of the health system. Historically, hospital data on bad debt have been one marker of this event, but what if providers see fewer of such people in a competitive market? Similarly, insurance coverage has often been used as a proxy for potential access, but can we assume people get the care they need once they are insured and affiliated with a provider? What are the effects of differential cost sharing at point of service? How can one assess whether needed care is obtained when it is not clear what care people need? For example, with the growth of consolidation and competition, how can we assess the value of a nonprofit institution or determine the relationship between managed care and the public health infrastructure and how this affects community health? All of these are issues poorly captured in existing data.\n\nE. Cross-Cutting Issues and Needs\n\nA number of information needs expressed by respondents were more general and cut across the specific substantive questions and needs discussed thus far. These needs are reflected in the following questions:\n\nHow do each of the preceding issues translate to individual states? Do states have the data to answer these questions?\n\nWhat data should providers be required to report, for example, by state regulators (e.g. NAIC standards)? What data are needed for some functions, such as grievance procedures?\n\nHow can health plans get comparable data across the mix of models included in their network and diverse products so they can compare components in their system and also compare themselves against others (taking into account difference in the levels of illness in the population, and provider structures)?\n\nWhat clinical information systems are needed to address purchaser demands?\n\nHow can we get consistent regulatory financial and other data on managed care when they are regulated differently across states and payers?\n\nEach of these issues arises as efforts are made to apply data to the diverse operational needs of the different groups.\n\nF. Summary List of Key Data Gaps\n\nTable 6 summarizes key data gaps by type that stakeholders perceive in today’s market. Note that a “data gap” is not synonymous with an “information need”. In practice, information needs are met by merging multiple kinds of data to answer a question. Thus, an absent core data element (like transaction and service based information on encounters with appropriate identifiers to link it back to people or health plans can limit the ability to develop information to meet a number of needs. Thus, our focus here on data gaps is to highlight core data elements or kinds of data that are needed to answer many of the kinds of questions stakeholders raise. The first sets are substantive concerns dealing with aspects of the health care system, while the last relate to attributes of useful data.\n\nIn terms of structural information, key gaps in information exist with specific components of the system, though the more serious concerns arise from the rapidly evolving and shifting linkages between these components, which influences the process of care. The absence of a comprehensive census of health insurance plans or arrangements or set of identifiers with information or plan characteristics is a key gap since it means there is not effective frame for data collection. Two other important gaps involve limitations in data on ambulatory care and nonphysician providers; and information on community-based alternatives to long-term care.\n\nWith respect to linkages in the health system, the key gaps appear to be related to the limited information on ownership of provider practice and aggregation of providers as consolidation proceeds. The gaps are also related to the limited information on the arrangements between managed care plans and providers. Information about how components relate across the continuum of care also are limited. Our interviews suggest that gaps are a major concern for private sector stakeholders, as well as others. These concerns also are relatively recent, reflecting changes in the delivery of health care with consolidated and managed care.\n\nIn terms of the process of care, the concerns are generally that the available structural information and encounter systems may not provide the kind of understanding needed about how medical practice functions and is determined. This makes it hard to develop good estimates of resource needs and further limits the information available on the efficiency of the are process. Most basically, these needs reflect the broader question of how to obtain process information on how care is delivered and also to better link it with structural information (i.e., on individual providers and systems, including their characteristics). There is a related need for information that could be used to determine how to develop the ability to do standard comparisons based on patient-level information. This effort might involve comparing how care is delivered across in managed care, and fee-for-service sectors. This gap exists for two reasons: (1) there is typically no universal set of transac"
