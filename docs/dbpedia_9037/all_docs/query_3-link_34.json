        "text": "Jason Robert Brown has been hailed as “one of Broadway’s smartest and most sophisticated songwriters since Stephen Sondheim” (Philadelphia Inquirer), and his “extraordinary, jubilant theater music” (Chicago Tribune) has been heard all over the world, whether in one of the hundreds of productions of his musicals every year or in his own incendiary live performances. Jason’s score for “THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY,” a musical adapted with Marsha Norman from the bestselling novel, received two Tony Awards (for Best Score and Orchestrations). “HONEYMOON IN VEGAS,” based on Andrew Bergman’s film, opened on Broadway in 2015 following a triumphant production at Paper Mill Playhouse. A film version of his epochal Off-Broadway musical “THE LAST FIVE YEARS” was released in 2015, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan and directed by Richard LaGravenese. His major musicals as composer and lyricist include: “13,” written with Robert Horn and Dan Elish, which opened on Broadway in 2008 and became a celebrated Netflix musical in 2022; “THE LAST FIVE YEARS,” which was cited as one of Time Magazine’s 10 Best of 2001 and won Drama Desk Awards for Best Music and Best Lyrics (and was later directed by the composer in its record-breaking Off-Broadway run at Second Stage Theatre in 2013); “PARADE,” written with Alfred Uhry and directed by Harold Prince, which won both the Drama Desk and New York Drama Critics’ Circle Awards for Best New Musical, as well as garnering Jason the Tony Award for Original Score; and “SONGS FOR A NEW WORLD,” a theatrical song cycle directed by Daisy Prince, which has since been seen in hundreds of productions around the world since its 1995 Off-Broadway debut, including a celebrated revival at New York’s City Center in the summer of 2018. “Parade” was also the subject of two major revivals: the first, directed by Rob Ashford, at London’s Donmar Warehouse and then at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles; and the second, Michael Arden’s acclaimed 2023 Broadway production starring Ben Platt and Micaela Diamond. Jason collaborated with comedy legend Billy Crystal, Amanda Green, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel on a Broadway musical of “MR. SATURDAY NIGHT” Jason conducted his orchestral adaptation of E.B. White’s novel “THE TRUMPET OF THE SWAN” with the National Symphony Orchestra and recorded the score for PS Classics.\n\nJason’s next show, a chamber musical created with Daisy Prince and Jonathan Marc Sherman called “THE CONNECTOR,” opens in January 2024 at MCC Theater. Future projects include an adaptation of Lilian Lee’s “FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE,” created with Kenneth Lin and Moisés Kaufman; and “MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL” a new musical written with Taylor Mac based on John Berendt’s book and directed by Rob Ashford. Jason is the winner of the 2018 Louis Auchincloss Prize, the 2002 Kleban Award for Outstanding Lyrics, and the 1996 Gilman & Gonzalez-Falla Foundation Award for Musical Theatre. Jason’s songs, including the cabaret standard “Stars and the Moon,” have been performed and recorded by Ariana Grande, Jennifer Nettles, Brandi Carlile, Audra McDonald, Kristin Chenoweth, Billy Porter, Betty Buckley, Renée Fleming, Jon Hendricks and many others."
