        "text": "FAU's student-run record label Hoot/Wisdom Recordings recently released an extended play soundtrack of a never-before recorded composition by famed Broadway composer Charles Strouse. The composition, titled \"Three American Pieces,\" was performed by Heather Coltman, D.M.A., dean of FAU's Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. Strouse wrote \"Three American Pieces\" in the early part of his music career, but this is the first time they have been recorded.\n\n\"I wrote these pieces after I'd graduated from Music School (Eastman) and began to face the world,\" said Strouse. \"What sustained me was agility in jazz, and I eked out a living playing in bands, or soloing in bars, although always making time for composing. However, one talent (inevitably) took over the other, and these three pieces are a reflection of that transitional time.\"\n\nStrouse visited FAU in 2012 for the 10th anniversary celebration of the commercial music program at FAU. He visited as a guest of Michael Zager, Dorothy F. Schmidt eminent scholar in the performing arts and founder of FAU's commercial music program. It was at that time that Strouse asked Coltman if she would be interested in recording \"Three American Pieces.\" Coltman also has agreed to record an additional composition by Strouse at FAU's recording studios sometime in the near future.\n\nStrouse's compositions have been recorded by such well-known stars as Frank Sinatra and Barbara Streisand. His first Broadway musical, \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" written with Lee Adams, starred Dick Van Dyke and \"Applause\" starred Lauren Bacall. Strouse is a three-time Tony Award winner for \"Annie,\" \"Applause,\" and \"Bye Bye Birdie.\" Strouse also has been inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Three American Pieces\" is available for sale on iTunes, Amazon and other reputable digital services.
