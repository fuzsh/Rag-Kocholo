        "text": "There’s a new Miss Hannigan in town.\n\nStarting Dec. 4, “Annie” starring EGOT winner Whoopi Goldberg as the aforementioned orphanage matron will run at New York City’s The Theater at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe curtains close on the beloved musical on Jan. 5, 2025; Goldberg is slated to appear in all performances from Dec. 11 until the end of the run.\n\n“I love the theater, and in my mind, there is no better way to spend the holidays than to get back on stage,” the 68-year-old actress and “The View” host shared in a press release. “I can’t wait to step into the delicious role of Miss Hannigan and perform for the greatest audiences in the world — in my hometown of New York City.”\n\nThis production, directed by former cast member Jenn Thompson (she played Pepper), will be the first time “Annie” has been performed in NYC since 2012’s Tony-nominated production starring Tony winner Katie Finneran.\n\n“It is a dream come true to bring ‘Annie’ back home for the first time in 10 years, just in time for the holidays,” composer Charles Strouse said. “And having the iconic Whoopi Goldberg join the company and make her first appearance ever in a production of ‘Annie’ is a gift to us all! I know Martin (Charnin) and Tom (Meehan) would be thrilled, too.”\n\nIf seeing Annie, Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, Grace, and Rooster live during the holiday season sounds like a dream come true, you’re in luck.\n\nFans can purchase tickets for all upcoming “Annie” shows on sites like Vivid Seats; the official on-sale is Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nVivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.\n\n“Annie” NYC tickets\n\nNot sure which Annie production makes the most sense for your holiday calendar?\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nA complete schedule including all show dates, start times, and links to buy tickets can be found below.\n\n“Annie” touring all over North America\n\nThe beloved show won’t only be on the Big Apple stage in the near future.\n\nFans all over North America can catch “Annie” this coming fall, winter, and spring.\n\nFor a closer look, here are all the theaters the musical will be at from now until May 2025.\n\nHuge musicals on Broadway in 2024\n\nThe Great White Way never disappoints.\n\nCase in point, here are just five, huge, can’t-miss, crowd-pleasing productions running on Broadway that will leave you with a big smile on your face.\n\n• “Lion King”\n\n• “Hell’s Kitchen”\n\n• “Six: The Musical”\n\n• “Back To The Future”\n\n• “The Wiz”\n\nPrefer a concert?
