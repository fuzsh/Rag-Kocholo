        "text": "Keeping your own last name after marriage is not about feminism anymore. Women are holding on to their maiden names because of their careers, especially if they work in the media, or other fields where they cultivate a brand name.\n\nI recently moved to Atlanta after getting married. A couple of people I was introduced to here asked if “Tulshyan” was my maiden name, and whether I was planning to take on my husband’s last name.\n\nLegally, it would take me a while to change it. But I wondered if I should take my husband’s last name, hassle-free, on social media (Facebook, Twitter etc.) After some thought I decided to keep my maiden name, but it had nothing to do with making a social statement. It's strictly business.\n\nAs a journalist, I have a (tiny) following of readers who recognize my stories by my maiden byline. Speaking to other recently or to-be married female journalists, we agreed that changing our names, or double-barreling, is not a good idea in our profession. Two famous examples are Christiane Amanpour and Maria Shriver, who didn't take their husband’s names, and instead built their own brand names professionally. Perhaps Maria's relieved she never became a “Schwarzenegger,” in hindsight. Even Kim Kardashian chose not to take her ex-husband, Kris Humphries', last name after much debate on air last year, for fear of losing the Kardashian \"empire.\"\n\nHow is society taking the change? I faced a dilemma when I was sending out wedding invites. Some of my guests were eminent women in the Singaporean community, known to me by their maiden names.\n\nThe conundrum: should we address invites to “Ms. Smith and Mr. Jones” or “Mr. & Mrs. Jones.” What’s the right protocol? I spoke to Anna Post, co-author of Emily Post’s Etiquette, who said:\n\n“The correct etiquette is to address them in the way they refer to themselves. So the invitation should read, for example, ‘Ms. Jane Rasmussen and Mr. Timothy Caldwell.’ That way you are respecting the woman's choice to keep her own name.\n\nWhen introducing the couple to other people, the right way to introduce them is as 'Jane Rasmussen and her husband Timothy Caldwell.' By stating their relationship, you are alleviating any confusion of the different last names, said Post.\n\nUltimately, women choose to take on their husband’s last names – or not – for a variety of reasons. The decision to change could be career harming, or maybe, career propelling. It could be to keep an identity, or simply because one of your last names is a “better fit.” In Asia too, it’s becoming a lot more common for women to keep their own last names after marriage. It makes me feel lucky because it's a choice my mother and grandmother never had, growing up in India."
