        "text": "Christiane Amanpour kindly met me for Saturday brunch at my place on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and, though we had never met before, this striking, world-famous woman sat at the kitchen table looking completely at home.\n\n“This is amazing,” I said. “It’s as if you’ve sprung out of the TV on the wall.”\n\n“Perhaps I’m a hologram,” she said, and laughed.\n\nBut Ms. Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent, who has reported fervently from the global front lines of war for over 25 years, has always been exceptionally real and unpretentious—although she looked a little wary when I asked, “Can you cook?”\n\n“Not that much,” she confessed.\n\n“I was going to ask if you might make us scrambled eggs—but I have backup.”\n\n“What a relief!” she exclaimed. “Fantastic!”\n\nI had laid on a selection of sandwiches and cookies bought by my own hand from Le Pain Quotidien across the street. “Lovely!” she said, helping herself to a comforting egg-salad sandwich. “Coffee would be great, actually, if it isn’t a pain in the neck.”\n\nChristiane Maria Amanpour was born in London in 1958 and raised in Tehran, the Catholic daughter of a British mother and an Iranian father, who was an airline executive. Her adolescence included time at a convent boarding school in England; she grew up speaking Persian, English, and French. The family left everything behind in Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\n“Our lives were suddenly turned upside down. But I was old enough to be fascinated by what was happening. It set me on the road to a career in journalism.”\n\nHer father, she mentioned, is now 97 years old. “He’s incredibly with it! We’re a very, very close family. My mother is 19 years younger than my dad, and they’re still together.” She also has three younger sisters (a teacher, a journalist, and a photographer).\n\nHer British roots have never quite left her. In 2007 she received a C.B.E. (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, no less) from the Queen at Buckingham Palace. “I’ll tell you something odd. I grew up a monarchist in Iran. It was all I knew. And I respected the British monarchy. But in the interim I’ve tried to put the spotlight on people who are struggling for their rights, or the right to stay alive, and that really affected me when it came to standing in front of the Queen to receive the honor. Because I couldn’t curtsy—even though I grew up curtsying. I bowed instead.”\n\nI asked her if she ever got afraid on assignment. “Yeah,” she responded, avoiding making a song and dance about her own scary experiences of extreme danger. “It’s what you do; it’s what you do.... We’re in a country’s backyard, literally reporting in real time about the atrocities that are being committed. You always think about the worst that could happen—getting tortured, or maybe raped. Certainly, as a woman, that’s a big fear. And otherwise getting injured or killed. I’ve been lucky.”\n\nShe knocked wood.\n\nI reluctantly mentioned the loss by rocket fire earlier this year of Marie Colvin, while on assignment in Syria, and of other dedicated foreign correspondents and colleagues she knew. She responded gravely, “This has been a very bad year. Marie snuck into Syria under terrifying circumstances to get the truth out. She was in an area with civilians who were being deliberately shelled. And I would say the most chilling change since I’ve been doing this job is that, whether it’s in Syria, Libya, Russia, or the Philippines, journalists are now being targeted. They want to shut us up. Look at the statistics. They’re killing the messenger.”\n\nAccording to the respected Committee to Protect Journalists, 914 journalists have been killed in trouble spots round the world since 1992. Seventy percent of them were deliberate murders; 9 percent were tortured before death.\n\n“I’m sorry to put this question to you,” I said, “but what of the fairly common view that foreign correspondents are war junkies?”\n\n“That’s the biggest pile of crap. There’s also a certain kind of person who’s attracted to being an astrophysicist or a soldier or taking risks at sports. We need the adrenaline to keep us safe. We’re not heroin addicts. If you want us to be the eyes and ears in our field—not people spinning in the blogosphere or sitting in armchairs opining about what’s going on in the rest of the world—you need people who are willing to go to the battlefront.”\n\nWhen Amanpour reported from Bosnia early in her career, she was accused of bias when she passionately claimed that there was clear evidence of genocide. “If I had been reporting World War II, would I have had to say in the name of objectivity, ‘Poor Mr. Hitler, he has a point’? No, you don’t play footsie with the most appalling crimes known to humanity. I realized in Bosnia that, even if it means you’re going to be accused of not being fair, you have to tell the truth.”\n\n“Your truth—or someone else’s?”\n\n“You give all sides a fair hearing, and you also make it absolutely clear what the facts are and what the truth is. We’re having this debate at CNN now about this whole question of balance and neutrality. At least for me, journalism isn’t about ‘on the one hand ... on the other.’ In the end, it’s about accountability—holding power accountable.”\n\nIn an unprecedented agreement with ABC News, where she is global-affairs anchor, she hosts her own CNN International weekday interview program on foreign affairs, Amanpour. She now lives in New York with her husband, James Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state to President Clinton, and their 12-year-old son, Darius. Perhaps, I suggested, this all means that she’ll be spending less time reporting truth and lies from the war zones of the world.\n\n“You know, there are countless mothers who are on the road reporting from the field right now. But for sure I’m not so much the so-called fireman correspondent any longer. I still go on the road. But I feel different, you know? You want to get back to your child. So I’m away for shorter periods and I’m much more careful about wearing body armor and not pushing my luck.”\n\nAnd at that, with a free afternoon ahead, Christiane Amanpour went to meet her husband and cheer on her son at his soccer game."
