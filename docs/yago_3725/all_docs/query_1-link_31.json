        "text": "Unlike most of the celebrities who draw paying audiences to The Denver Post’s Unique Lives lecture program, Christiane Amanpour and Jamie Rubin are not splashy, jokey people. They are not onstage to sell a book or movie. They don’t tell showbiz-honed stories about their most embarrassing moments or drop names of whom they’ve met on the climb to stardom.\n\nAmanpour, the chief foreign correspondent for CNN and a renowned journalistic presence from the world’s war zones for decades, and her husband, James Rubin, former assistant secretary of state for public affairs and a TV analyst and academic, have a serious message.\n\nWhen they speak May 18 at the Buell Theatre (tickets at 1-877-872-8124 or online events unlimited.org), it will be much less about their personal lives, their marriage or of being a power couple in Washington and New York than about their travels overseas and what they’ve learned as a result.\n\n“We don’t present ourselves as personalities with kind of color, humor, all that stuff,” Rubin said by phone Monday. “We’re serious people.”\n\n“It’s not about us,” Amanpour said. “We both feel that foreign-policy and foreign-news coverage are kind of endangered species.”\n\nThey’ve been impressed, at similar gatherings, by the quality of the questions asked and the level of interest from audiences.\n\nPolls before the election found that one of the main goals of the American people was the restoration of America’s standing in the world. “Today, people say that is one of the things they’re most pleased Obama has achieved,” Amanpour said. “Same overseas.”\n\nThe antipathy to America built up over the years of the previous administration is easing, Amanpour said. “The page has definitely turned.”\n\nShe’s recently roamed the Palestinian territory, Gaza, the West Bank and Afghanistan, and interviewed international leaders in Davos, Switzerland, gauging the new dynamic. While she won’t predict the end of a bad era in U.S.-global relations, she believes Obama has laid the groundwork for progress.\n\n“I can feel in my solar plexus how massively important this moment is.”\n\nAmanpour is working on a two-hour CNN documentary for this summer on Muslim youth. “We cannot afford to have another generation of Muslims that see us as the enemy,” she said.\n\nAdditionally CNN will launch a program in September (a half-hour nightly on CNN International, one hour on CNN on weekends), built around Amanpour, examining foreign news, issues and interviews of the day.\n\nShe avoids commenting on CNN’s recent ratings and performance, saying she would like to see more serious foreign news. “I’m lobbying all the time for it. I wish it were more prevalent on every network.”\n\nRubin, formerly part of the Clinton administration, is not interested in getting back into government now, although he doesn’t rule it out for the future. He’s teaching at Columbia University and has an academic project on Iran in the works.\n\nFor now, they’re pushing the importance of foreign assistance to developing countries. Building infrastructure is not sexy, they allow, but “nation building” is the key.\n\n“The problem is the way our system has operated for many, many years now,” Rubin said. “Congress and interest groups for military spending are very strong. Groups that do assistance are relatively weak. There isn’t a constituency for development, for foreign assistance. The percentage of U.S. military spending that’s on foreign assistance is very small compared to what people think it is. Less than 1 percent of the federal budget, one-tenth of 1 percent of the GNP. Most people think it’s 10 times that high.”\n\n“In short,” Amanpour said, “that vital business of these countries that you (America) now own is a not very sexy, very long, quite expensive project.” Still, it’s cheaper than losing lives in war.\n\n“In our ADD culture, it’s the most difficult thing to push in terms of public awareness. I’ve come back even more sure of that since my last trip: If Afghanistan does not get some assistance to provide some alternative to the Taliban, there is no hope.”\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830 or jostrow@denverpost.com"
