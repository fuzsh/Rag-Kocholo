        "text": "In an email from the State Department's release of information from Hillary Clinton's private server in March, Rubin pitches a meeting between Clinton and notable writers and journalists in New York City in order to clarify the \"difficulties and complexities\" of Clinton's service as secretary of state as a primer for when they decide to describe her service in the position.\n\nWhile that is the main purpose of the email, a sidenote apparently disclosed Amanpour's feelings and includes a backhanded compliment for CNN.\n\nRubin wrote: \"p.s. my wife was appalled at the Anderson Cooper diary fiasco; unfortunately, cnn is still the best of a declining industry...\"\n\nRubin was referring to the 2012 controversy that CNN found itself in after using the contents of a journal it found belonging to a slain US ambassador and failing to disclose that the journal was its source for subsequent reporting.\n\nThe ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, was killed at the US consulate after an attack by Libyan rebels. A CNN reporter found his journal among the ruins. It was revealed later that CNN made notes about items from the journal before handing it over to Libyan officials and contacting Stevens' family. Later, Cooper would use the information from the journal in a report on his CNN show, \"Anderson Cooper 360,\" but he didn't reveal that the information originated from Stevens' journal.\n\nWhen CNN's use of the journal came to light two days after Cooper's report, the State Department said CNN's actions were \"disgusting\" and a breach of the news outlet's promise to Stevens' family that it wouldn't use the journal in its reporting.\n\nCNN countered that reporting the important information from the journal was its responsibility as a news organization. That became the subject of heated debate in the days that followed.\n\nAs a result of Rubin's email, we now know at least one major CNN reporter, Amanpour, was strongly against CNN and Cooper's use of the journal.\n\nCNN and Amanpour have not responded to Business Insider's request for comment. Attempts to contact Rubin went unanswered."
