        "text": "CHRISTIANE Amanpour has long worked for CNN in London since 1983 and currently hosts the network's international affairs program.\n\nThe veteran journalist has been off-air in late May/early June 2021 due to her ovarian cancer diagnosis and said it had been a \"roller coaster.\"\n\nHow old is Christiane Amanpour?\n\nChristiane Amanpour is an Iranian-British reporter born on January 12, 1958, making the journalist 65 years old.\n\nThe star reporter is CNN's chief international anchor of the award-winning, flagship show Amanpour, which also airs on PBS in the United States.\n\nAmanpour rose quickly through the organization, becoming a reporter at the New York bureau, and later, the network's top international correspondent.\n\nHer \"fearless and uncompromising approach made her popular with audiences and a force to be reckoned with by global influencers,\" according to her bio.\n\nIn May 2021, Amanpour revealed she has ovarian cancer – and urged other women to get screened.\n\nShe announced that she had undergone chemotherapy to cure her cancer.\n\nAt the time she told CNN viewers: \"I've had successful major surgery to remove it, and I'm now undergoing several months of chemotherapy for the very best possible long-term prognosis, and I'm confident.\"\n\nOn September 29, 2021, Amanpour announced that she was set to undergo her last chemotherapy session in 18 weeks.\n\nSpeaking to Robin Roberts on Good Morning America that she described the process as \"grueling, fatiguing, tiring and emotionally wearing.\"\n\nShe credited early detection by her doctors as the key to her recovery.\n\nOnly six months after Amanpour's last session of chemotherapy, the journalist got back on her feet coving the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWhat is Amanpour’s net worth?\n\nThe renowned journalist has a net worth of $18million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, which she garnered from her robust career.\n\nAmanpour’s annual salary at CNN is $5million.\n\nAlongside her journalism career, Amanpour made a couple of appearances in cinema.\n\nShe appeared in Iron Man 2, Pink Panther 2, and the series finale episode of Gilmore Girls titled Bon Voyage.\n\nWhat did Amanpour say about CNN and Trump?\n\nOn May 17, 2023, Amanpour gave a speech at the Columbia School of Journalism's graduation ceremony openly speaking out against her network.\n\nHer reasoning for retaliation came from CNN's decision to host former president Donald Trump for a town hall on May 10.\n\nAmanpour began by saying: \"To hold the powerful accountable is not just a slogan, it is vital. And when we do it well, it makes a huge difference. And when we don’t, it makes an equal and opposite difference.\"\n\nThis prompted the journalist to talk about the town hall and Amanpour's encounter with CNN's CEO, Chris Licht.\n\n\"I still respectfully disagree with allowing Donald Trump to appear in that particular format. We know Trump and his tendencies. Everyone does. He just seizes the stage and dominates,\" she continued.\n\n\"No matter how much flack the moderator tries to aim at the incoming, it doesn’t often work. For me, I would have dropped the mic at ‘nasty person,’ but then that’s me.\n\n\"His influence gradually decreased with all but his fervent colleagues and cults. So maybe less is more. Maybe live is not always right.\n\n\"Be truthful, but not neutral. Bothsidesism is not always objectivity. It does not get you to the truth.\"\n\nDuring this speech, Amanpour also accepted the Columbia Journalism Award."
