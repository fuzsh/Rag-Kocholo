        "text": "From Town & Country\n\nPBS has found a replacement for Charlie Rose, at least for the moment.\n\nBroadcaster Christiane Amanpour's nightly global-affairs show, which originates on CNN, will air on PBS under the new title of \"Amanpour on PBS.\" The network cut ties with Rose last month after several women accused him of unwanted sexual advances.\n\n\"Amanpour on PBS adds to the long tradition of public affairs programming that has been a hallmark of public media for decades,\" PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement announcing the news.\n\nThe 58-year-old was born to an Iranian father and a British mother in London and then raised in Tehran. She studied journalism at the University of Rhode Island, from which she graduated summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nShe was hired by CNN after graduation, and worked as a desk assistant in the foreign office in Atlanta. Her first major assignment was covering the Iran-Iraq War, which prepared her for a number of other reporting gigs in conflict zones. Later assignments have taken her to Afghanistan, Israel, Pakistan, Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans, and she became a correspondent for CNN's New York bureau in 1990.\n\nIn 2007, Queen Elizabeth II named her a Commander in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for services to journalism.\" Amanpour is married to James Rubin, who served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs in the Clinton Administration from 1997 to 2000. They have a son, Darius John Rubin, who was born in 2000.\n\nShe has won two Peabody Awards for her reporting, and in addition to CNN has worked for ABC and CBS, where she was a reporter for 60 Minutes from 1996 through 2005.\n\nAmanpour and her family are now based in London, where she earns a $2-million salary, according to celebritynetworth.com. The site also estimates her net worth to be $12.5 million.\n\nNew York's PBS station started airing her show on Monday, and it will air on other PBS stations starting December 11 at 11 p.m.\n\nWith reporting from the Associated Press\n\nYou Might Also Like"
