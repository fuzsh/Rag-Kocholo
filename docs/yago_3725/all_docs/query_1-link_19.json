        "text": "This article is more than 3 years old.\n\nTopline\n\nChristiane Amanpour announced on-air Monday that she is undergoing a round of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe 63-year-old British-Iranian journalist returned to hosting her Amanpour global news show on CNN Monday after four weeks off, during which she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and underwent a successful major surgery.\n\nShe says she will undergo three months of chemotherapy “for the best possible long-term prognosis.”\n\nAmanpour added she wanted to tell viewers to encourage women to educate themselves about ovarian cancer and have regular screenings.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nAmanpour said the past month has been “a bit of a roller coaster,” but that she feels “confident.”\n\nKey Background\n\nAmanpour is one of the world’s leading foreign news journalists, and has covered events from the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe to Hurricane Katrina. She began her career at CNN as an entry-level assistant on the foreign desk before moving up within the ranks of the broadcaster to become its chief international correspondent and the anchor of her own show, Amanpour. She left CNN for two years to work as an anchor at ABC News before returning in 2012. In 2018, Amanpour replaced Charlie Rose on PBS after his show was cancelled over sexual harassment allegations. Amanpour was married to James Rubin, a former U.S. diplomat who served as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs under former president Bill Clinton and later worked as a journalist, before divorcing after 20 years of marriage. Together they had one son, Darius, who was born in 2000.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.
