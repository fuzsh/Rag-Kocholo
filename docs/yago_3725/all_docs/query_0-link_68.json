Only one TV news anchor was in attendance as a guest, but plenty of media moguls made the list.\n\nABC News “This Week” anchor Christiane Amanpour attended with her husband James Rubin. Amanpour’s boss, Disney CEO Bob Iger, also attended, with his wife Willow Bay.\n\nGeneral Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, having closed the deal to sell a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast, was in attendance, as was Wendi Deng Murdoch, the wife of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch. Rupert, however, was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome other media types, after the jump.\n\nSinger Barbara Streisand was in attendance for some reason, as was action star Jackie Chan. Fashion icon Vera Wang was also there, along with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. James Fallows from The Atlantic, David Ignatius from The Washington Post and Thomas Friedman from The New York Times also made the cut."
