        "text": "What makes me wonder even more in the case of the above Eighteenth Dynasty repetitions is that Thutmose III and IV, as well as bearing the same nomen (Thutmose, “Born of the god Thoth”), also had the same praenomen, Menkheperre (“Lasting are the Manifestations of Re”). As well as that ‘they’ shared the Horus name, Kanakht.\n\nUrk. IV 733:4-7 is a brief but very intriguing passage from the Annals of Thutmose III. The passage describes a delivery of items from the land of tj-nꜢ-y, and provides the earliest known attestation of this (probably) Aegean toponym, while also providing the only surviving attestation of kft(j)w in the Annals, in reference to one of the items being delivered. Not surprisingly, this passage has often been mentioned in works and studies focusing on Egypt-Aegean interactions. However, the actual Egyptian wording of the passage has never been analysed or discussed in a detailed and systematic way, and as a result, the available translations usually reflect a rather superficial and somewhat approximate understanding of the text itself. The present article seeks to address this gap by providing a thorough reassessment of the text from both a linguistic and a sociocultural perspective. A framework for disambiguating translations and presenting multiple parallel interpretations will also be briefly introduced at the end.\n\nEach copy of any part of a JSTOR transmission must contain the same copyright notice that appears on the screen or printed page of such transmission.

Starting around the beginning of the fifteenth century B.C.E. this rivalry reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III (1490-1436 B.C.E). Among the military campaigns he directed towards the Levant, his eighth campaign, in year 33 of his reign, has been perceived in scholarly study of this conflict as the highest point. Owing to an exceptional variety of written sources which had been dedicated to its commemoration, as well as the implementation of some unprecedented tactical military moves in the course of this campaign, it won its grandeur, second only to the Megiddo campaign. This paper aims at reanalyzing and reinterpreting the sources concerning the eighth campaign. Further investigations into the sources from the time of Thutmose III and a reconsideration of former views about the significance of this campaign bring us to an alternative...\n\nThis article extends upon the results of Derstine [GM 249 (2016) 39-57] providing astrocalendrical support for Amenhotep I's Sothic/New Moon date in 1517 BC and the conventional chronology of Thutmose III (1490-1436 BC). This somewhat compressed timeframe necessitates a reevaluation of the regnal year reckoning of early Thutmoside monarchs. There is a growing consensus that Thutmose II reigned no more than three years; evidence will be adduced here that he ruled between 13 and 22 months. The length of Thutmose I's reign, though lacking explicit attestation, may be determined indirectly. Toward that end, the present study turns to recent elucidation of pathology in Thutmose II's mummy, texts suggesting various coregencies, and changes in Hatshepsut's titles and iconography in search of answers to longstanding questions surrounding Thutmoside succession.\n\nThis paper serves as a suggestion as to why and how Aakheperkare Thutmose I came to the throne of Egypt. It is also an attempt to distinguish between two Theban princes, both named Ahmose, who both died young. Were it not for the premature passing of one of them, Thutmose I would probably never have become pharaoh."
