In his 5th Year of reign, he led a campaign against an area in Nubia called Akuyata and later he did not go himself but Amenhotep, son of Hapu his official did that.\n\nAmenhotep III kept very good relation with the countries his father controlled and many of the alliances his father had made. Amenhotep III was an excellent diplomatic character and he used tactics never used before him. However, Amenophis III did his best to keep those relation in the right way, trade not control territories, prosper not force.\n\nThe king was very kind and generous his allies by offering gifts of gold and alabaster.
