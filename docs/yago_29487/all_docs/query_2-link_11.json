        "text": "For other pages by this name, see Nefertari.\n\nNefertari (ancient Egyptian: nfr-tỉry, \"Beautiful Companion\") was a Queen of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom.\n\nFamily[]\n\nNefertari was the first King's Great Wife of Pharaoh Thutmose IV.[1] Her origins are unknown, it is likely that she was a commoner. On several depictions she and Queen Mother Tiaa are depicted as goddesses accompanying Thutmose IV. In Year 7 the new Great Royal Wife was Thutmose's sister Iaret; Nefertari either died or was pushed into the background when Iaret was old enough to become Thutmose's wife.[2]\n\nIt is not known whether any children were born to either Nefertari or Iaret; after Thutmose IV's death the next pharaoh was Amenhotep III, the son of a secondary wife called Mutemwia.[1]\n\nAttestations[]\n\nShe was depicted together with her husband before gods in Giza, on eight stelae. She was also shown on a stela found in the Luxor temple and was mentioned on a scarab found at the harem palace at Merwer (the current site of Medinet el-Ghurob).[1]\n\nBurial[]\n\nNefertari probably died in Year 7 of her husband's reign. The whereabouts of her tomb and mummy remain unknown.\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]"
