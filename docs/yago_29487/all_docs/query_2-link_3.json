        "text": "Thutmose IV was buried in tomb KV43 in the Valley of the Kings, but his body was eventually relocated to the mummy cache in KV35, where Victor Loret found it in 1898. An examination of his remains reveals that he was gravely unwell and had been withering away in the months leading up to his death. Amenhotep III, his son, succeeded him to the throne. A physician from Imperial College London has looked into Thutmose IV’s early death, as well as the deaths of other Eighteenth dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Akhenaten). He comes to the conclusion that their early deaths were most likely caused by a family temporal epilepsy. Due to the link of this form of epilepsy with great spiritual visions and religiosity, this would account for both Thutmose IV’s sudden death and his religious vision depicted on the Dream Stele."
