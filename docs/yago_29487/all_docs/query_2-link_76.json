However, there are a couple of competing theories -- he may have been a son of Ahmose, albeit by a lesser wife, or he may have been co-regent for some time before Amenhotep I's death. This may have made him the designated heir and does support some relationship between the two. Thutmose was married to Ahmose, who was a sister to Amenhotep I and daughter of Ahmose the pharaoh.\n\nHe reigned as sole ruler for about six years and during that time he ran several military campaigns in western Asia and Nubia, like his predecessor. He was probably continuing the military plans of Amenhotep, which he had been responsible for as a military commander for the previous pharaoh. He managed to push the southern border of Egypt to the Third Cataract in Nubia -- it is rumored that he defeated the Nubian chief in hand-to-hand combat and returned to Thebes with the body of the dead chieftain hanging from the prow of his boat.\n\nOf course, his greatest campaigns aware in the Delta, where he continued to fight against the Hyksos as had the other pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty. He did finally reach the Euphrates River, pushing the invaders back.\n\nInternally, Thutmose was a prolific and visible builder, relying on his architect Ineni to add extensively to the temple at Karnak, where he added the fourth and fifth pylons , added a cedar hypostyle hall and expanded the treasury, in addition to adding the largest standing obelisk in the temple courtyard.\n\nThere is some discussion about where Thutmose I is buried - Valley of the Kings tomb 20 contains a yellow quartzite sarcophagi inscribed for him an his daughter, tomb 38 may have contained his mummy. Tomb KV 38 was prepared for him by his grandson Thutmose III. His architect, Ineni, was responsible for the design nd building of the king's tomb, as well"
