        "text": "After the Egyptian archaeological mission working in Luxor Temple announced that it had found a group of important royal antiquities, including an offering table dating back to the Roman era, as well as a black granite funerary plaque dating back to the era of the New Kingdom, depicting for the first time both King Thutmose IV and Amenhotep II together in a scene To present offerings to the god Amun while he is sitting on the throne, where King Tuthmosis IV appears offering bread, and King Amenhotep the Second holding incense in his right hand and in the other offering water, so what is the story of the two kings?\n\nKing Thutmose IV is the son of Amenhotep II, from the eighteenth dynasty in the era of the modern state. The “Dream Panel” erected by King Thutmose IV between the feet of the Sphinx in Giza tells us that when he was a young prince, he slept in the shadows of this huge statue, during a hunting trip. In the nearby desert, the Sphinx appeared to him in his dream, and ordered him to remove the sand covering his body, in exchange for becoming the next king on the throne of the country.\n\nThe mummy was found in 1898 in the tomb of Amenhotep II (KV 35) in the Valley of the Kings, and was in good condition, and it turns out that the king died young between his mid-twenties and early thirties, his well-preserved face still with a slight smile, and his thick hair dark reddish brown, had been embalmed. In the royal position, with the arms crossed on the chest.\n\nAmenhotep II\n\nAmenhotep the Second, who is considered one of the most famous warriors of the modern state and was known as the \"Sporty King\", inherited a large empire from his father, the master of the kings of Egypt, the most famous warrior pharaoh, King Thutmose III, and launched a few military campaigns in Syria.\n\nThe book “Warrior Pharaohs: Diplomats and Military” by Dr. Hussein Abdel Basir says that King Amenhotep the Second was known to have been very fond of sports. An entertaining sport as he saw it.\n\nDr. Hussein Abdel Basir added: Amenhotep the Second tried to preserve the Asian empire that he owned from his father, King Thutmose III the Great, by using cruelty to crush any rebellion that might arise against him, so we see him in the third year of his reign sending a campaign to northern Syria, and those were the first wars he launched against Asia, and we found inscriptions in the columns of Elephantine and in Armant, in which the athletic king Amenhotep II is proud of killing seven princes from northern Syria. of countries and villages.\n\nThen he headed to the famous city of Kadesh, which as soon as its people knew of his existence, they went to offer him an oath of loyalty and obedience. In it, he defeated its people a heavy defeat, and took from them prisoners estimated at ninety thousand, and arrived with his army to the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia \"present-day Iraq\".\n\nAs a result of his resounding victories, the princes of Asia rushed to him, loaded with gifts and presented to the majesty of the sporting pharaoh, the obligations of loyalty and obedience. After the ninth year of his reign, King Amenhotep II turned to the attention of the internal affairs of the country after he was satisfied with his military achievements that brought him stability, comfort and safety throughout the empire. Spacious Egyptian.\n\nKing Amenhotep the Second departed after ruling Egypt for 25 years, and was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings, cemetery No. 35. This tomb was carved in the rock and decorated with pictures of the books of the other world.\n\nThis tomb was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898 AD, and perhaps the importance of this tomb is due to the fact that in one of the side chambers in this tomb, a cache of the mummies of the pharaohs was discovered and found in it a large number of mummies, mostly of kings who were transferred to his tomb, including his son Thutmose IV and his grandson Amenhotep III And the wife of the latter, Queen Tiye, the kings Siptah, Merneptah, Ramses IV, V, VI, Seti II, and West Nakht, in addition to the owner of the tomb who was found inside his coffin and around his neck a wreath of flowers."
