        "text": "Thutmose II\n\nThutmose means âborn of Thothâ. Thoth the god of scribes and considered to be the heart and tongue of Ra. Thoth is one of the most important deities of ancient Egypt.\n\nThutmose IIâs Family Tree\n\nThutmose II was born to Thutmose I and a secondary wife, Mutnofret. Thutmose IIâs older brothers, Wadjmose and Amenmose, died before they could ascend to their fatherâs (Thutmose Iâs) throne. This made Thutmose II the heir. Thutmose II was a weak man, but cunning enough to realize he should marry into true royalty to secure his kingship. Hatshepsut, both Thutmose IIâs half sister and cousin, was the oldest daughter of Thutmose I and his principal Queen, Ahmose. Hatshepsutâs influence over Egypt secured Thutmose IIâs leadership once he married her. Together, they had a daughter, Neferure. Thutmose IIâs only heir was Thutmose III, born to Iset, a secondary wife.\n\nÂ© JMCC1 - Relief of Thutmose II at Karnak\n\nQuestions about the Length of Thutmose IIâs Reign\n\nIt is hard for historians to determine the exact length of Thutmose IIâs reign. Many historians believe he ruled between 3 and 13 years. After his death, Hatshepsut had his name removed from monuments and temples. Once Hatshepsut removed her husbandâs name, she replaced it with her own. Once Hatshepsut died and Thutmose III took over as Pharaoh and no longer co-regent, he tried putting his fatherâs name back onto some of these buildings. These inconsistencies have scholars pinpointing his reign to be approximately from 1493 BC to 1479 BC.\n\nCampaigns\n\nThutmose II managed to crush a rebellion in Kush by sending an army to Nubia. His armies also stopped rebellions in the Levant (historic Palestine, Israel and Syria). They also defeated a group of nomadic Bedouins in the Sinai Peninsula. Even though Thutmose II did not lead these campaigns himself, he is credited with the results. The armies were, in fact, led by the kingâs generals.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ© isawnyu - Relief of Thutmose II\n\nÂ\n\nMonuments\n\nOne of the ways Pharaohs are remembered are by the monuments they leave behind. Since Hatshepsut had her husbandâs name removed from many monuments, itâs hard to determine what was originally built by him. However, a few monuments do remain including some in Kumma, Semna and Elephantine. The largest monument credited to his reign is a limestone gateway at Karnak. At one time, it was at the front of the 4th pylonâs forecourt. During his reign, he erected a festival court for the ancient Egyptians here. Unfortunately, for Thutmose II, the blocks used for this gateway were eventually taken down and used as a foundation for Amenhotep III.\n\nThutmose II and his wife, Hatshepsut, are depicted both together and separate in scenes on the Karnak gateway. Many historians believe that Hatshepsut was the real power of Egypt even during Thutmose IIâs reign. Hatshepsut claimed that her father (Thutmose I) wanted them to rule together. Plus, both foreign and domestic policies were similar during Thutmose IIâs reign and during Hatshepsutâs reign afterward.\n\nThutmose IIâs Mummy and his Burial Chamber\n\nÂ© G. Elliot Smith - The Mummy of Thutmose II\n\nNeither a royal tomb nor a mortuary temple for Thutmose II has ever been identified. His mummified body was found with the royal cache of mummies at Deir el-Bahari (also referred to as the Theban Necropolis). The royal cache held nearly 20 other mummified kings.\n\nThutmose IIâs mummy was in poor shape when it was unwrapped in 1886 by Gaston Maspero. It had been severely damaged after his death by ancient tomb robbers. Thutmose IIâs face and the shape of his head resembled Thutmose Iâs very closely, indicating that he was the kingâs son. Thutmose II died in his early 30âs. He had a skin disease that could not be covered by the act of embalming. His skin had patches and was covered in scars.\n\nThe state of Thutmose IIâs mummy revealed that he was a weak man. His thin body was shrunken and appeared to lack muscle. His skull was bald in patches. These conditions in addition to the condition of his skin were likely due to a disease that killed him.\n\nThutmose II Facts\n\nThutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and the father of Thutmose III, one of the most prolific pharaohs in Ancient Egypt.\n\nHis reign period is disputed, due to Hatshepsut's attempts to erase and replace his name with her own.\n\nThutmose II sent armies led by his generals on successful campaigns against rebellions and nomads.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahari in 1886.\n\nHis preserved body appears weak and presents evidence of a disease that was very likely the cause of his death.\n\nÂ"
