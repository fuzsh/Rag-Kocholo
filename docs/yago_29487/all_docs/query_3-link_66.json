        "text": "Based on the JAMA paper here's a photographic hall of fame based on Tutankhamun's new ly proposed family tree, just for a bit of fun. I'm sorry that they're not better - these are just the ones I have kicking around on my laptop. One does wonder what some of them looked like in \"real life\".\n\nYuya and his wife Thuya were the parents of Tiye (a daughter).\n\nYuya\n\nThuya\n\nTiye was married to the pharaoh Amenhotep III, the son of the pharaoh Thutmose IV and his wife Mutemwiya.\n\nAmenhotep III\n\nQueen Tiye, the \"Elder Lady\" in KV35\n\n(with thanks to the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology)\n\nTiye and Amenhotep III produced Amenhotep IV (who re-named himself Akhenaten). He married a daughter of Amenhotep III (but not necessarily of Queen Tiye) whose name is unknown but has been identified as \"The Younger Lady\", a mummy found in a cache of three in KV35. Amenhotep kept a harem and had 5 daughters, of which she was apparently one.\n\nAkhenaten / Amenhotep IV\n\n(possibly the mummy in KV55)\n\nThe Younger Lady (not at her best, unfortunately!)\n\nAkhenaten and his sister, the Younger Lady, produced Tutankhamun and, it is proposed, a sister to whom Tutankhamun may have been married and with whom he had two stillborn children.\n\nTutankhamun"
