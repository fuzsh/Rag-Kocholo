Southwest Airlines is a low-cost carrier that primarily serves destinations in the U.S. Over the years, the airline has evolved into one of the largest in the nation, with services to several international destinations and Hawaii. With no assigned seating and two free checked bags for every passenger, the airline eschews traditional status levels in favor of a more egalitarian approach.

The airlineâ€™s loyalty program, Rapid Rewards, has transformed over the years alongside the company and has become a strong currency in the frequent flyer world.
