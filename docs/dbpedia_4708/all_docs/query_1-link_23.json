        "text": "Southwest Rapid Rewards is one of the most popular frequent flyer programs for people who travel within the United States, as well as those who fly to the Caribbean and Mexico. This program is somewhat unique because it comes with unlimited rewards seats, no blackout dates and points that never expire. Plus, Southwest always offers two free checked bags per person for flights paid with cash or rewards, so members can save even more each time they travel with the airline.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points can be redeemed for flights, other types of travel, gift cards and more, so they’re slightly more flexible than other airline-based rewards. Better yet, Southwest is a Chase transfer partner, so you can rack up rewards with Chase travel credit cards and transfer them to Southwest Rapid Rewards later on.\n\nIf you’re curious about how this program works, read on to learn about the best ways to rack up and redeem Southwest points, the program’s elite status tiers and more.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards basics\n\nSouthwest Airlines flies to over 100 destinations across the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Mexico. That said, Southwest does not belong to an airline alliance, so you can’t use points to book with other airline partners.\n\nHow many points you’ll earn when you fly with the airline depends on your elite status level (if you’re an elite flyer) as well as the type of fare you book. Here’s a breakdown of how many points you’ll earn for flying, by fare type:\n\nFrom here, Southwest elites earn 25 percent to 100 percent more points for each dollar they spend on airfare, depending on their status tier. We’ll go over the types of Southwest elite status and how you can earn them in this article.\n\nHow to earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points\n\nWhile you can earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points by booking paid airfare through the program, there are other ways to earn rewards. Consider the following strategies to increase your Southwest points haul:\n\nEarn points through Southwest partners\n\nFlying Southwest may be one of the best ways to earn Rapid Rewards points, but it isn’t the only way. The Southwest Rapid Rewards program partners with popular brands like Marriott Bonvoy, Alamo, Hertz and many more. The number of points you’ll earn will vary depending on the partner, but you can earn points when you book an eligible hotel or rental car or else make an eligible retail purchase.\n\nEarn points through Southwest’s shopping portal\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards has its own shopping portal that lets you rack up points when you make purchases online. How many points you can earn varies by retailer and current promotions, but you can typically earn 2X to 5X points per dollar spent on eligible purchases when you click through the portal before you shop.\n\nEarn points through Southwest’s dining program\n\nYou can also join the Rapid Rewards Dining program to earn points when you eat out. Rapid Rewards Dining members can earn 3X points per dollar spent at participating restaurants when they opt in to receive email communications and pay with their linked card.\n\nNew members can even earn 500 bonus points within the first 30 days of joining. To achieve this bonus, you have to spend $25 or more at a participating restaurant and complete an online review within the 30-day period.\n\nEarn points through credit card spending\n\nSouthwest is a partner of the Chase Ultimate Rewards program; as such, you can use an eligible Chase credit card to rack up Ultimate Rewards points and then transfer them to Southwest Rapid Rewards.\n\nHowever, Chase also offers a handful of co-branded credit cards with Southwest. These cards let you earn points for every purchase you make while enjoying perks like early boarding and discounts on in-flight purchases. With that in mind, signing up for a Southwest card could be well worth it.\n\nHow to redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards points\n\nOnce you have Southwest Rapid Rewards points to spend, there are plenty of ways to use them. Consider the following strategies to get the most value from your rewards.\n\nRedeem for flights\n\nThe number of points required to book a flight varies based on the dollar value of the flight. This means that, when a Southwest flight drops in price, so does the number of points required to book the flight using your rewards. Also, note that the fare type will dictate how many points you need for a flight award. For example, Wanna Get Away flights cost less than Business Select flights.\n\nSouthwest also introduced a Cash + Points redemption option for airfare in April 2024. This option lets users pay for a flight with a combination of cash and points, which can come in handy if you’re short the points you need for a redemption.\n\nRedeem for other travel\n\nSouthwest lets you redeem points for stays at more than 400,000 hotels around the world. Redemption options and available properties vary, as do the number of points you’ll need to cash in for a free night.\n\nRedeem for gift cards or merchandise\n\nYou can also cash in Southwest points for gift cards with retailers like Apple, Target, Best Buy or Lowe’s. Alternatively, you can redeem rewards for select merchandise available through Southwest.\n\nRedeem for experiences and events\n\nSome experiences are also bookable with points, including spa packages and outdoor adventure tours. If you’re a Southwest credit card member, you can also use points to book exclusive events through Rapid Rewards Access Events.\n\nHow much are Southwest Rapid Rewards points worth?\n\nAccording to our internal points and miles valuations, Southwest Rapid Rewards points are worth about 1.5 cents each. This means that 50,000 Southwest Rapid Rewards points could be worth up to $750 if used for airfare.\n\nHow do Southwest Rapid Rewards points compare to other programs?\n\nWhile some frequent flyer miles are worth more than Southwest points, rewards earned in the majority of programs are less valuable on average. The chart below shows how Southwest points compare in value to rewards from several other popular programs.\n\nAirline loyalty program Bankrate value Southwest Rapid Rewards 1.5 cents Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles 0.7 cents Cathay Pacific Asia Miles 2.9 cents American AAdvantage 1.0 cents Delta SkyMiles 1.2 cents JetBlue TrueBlue 1.3 cents Virgin Atlantic Flying Club 2.6 cents\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards elite status tiers and benefits\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards offers two main status tiers: A-List and A-List Preferred. It also offers a highly-celebrated Companion Pass that’s often called out as the best in the industry. The chart below shows how you can achieve each status tier, along with the Companion Pass, and the perks you’ll get when you do:\n\nElite status tiers and benefits A-List A-List Preferred Companion Pass How to earn it Fly 20 qualifying one-way flights or earn 35,000 tier qualifying points in a calendar year Fly 40 qualifying one-way flights or earn 70,000 tier qualifying points in a calendar year Fly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 135,000 qualifying points in a calendar year Earning bonus 25% 100% N/A Benefits\n\nPriority boarding\n\nSame-day flight changes (based on availability)\n\nPriority check-in (based on availability)\n\nDedicated customer service line\n\nSame-day standby (based on availability)\n\nPriority boarding\n\nSame-day flight changes (based on availability)\n\nPriority check-in (based on availability)\n\nDedicated customer service line\n\nSame-day standby (based on availability)\n\nFree in-flight Wi-Fi\n\nEnjoy a free companion flight each time you book airfare with cash or points (airline taxes and fees apply)\n\nBenefit applies to the remainder of the calendar year you earn it in and the following calendar year\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards partners\n\nSouthwest Airlines doesn’t have any airline partners because it’s not a part of an airline alliance. However, the program does partner with other travel brands to help Rapid Rewards members earn more rewards. Here’s a rundown of major Southwest partners you should be aware of:\n\nBest Western\n\nChoice Hotels\n\nMarriott Bonvoy\n\nMGM Rewards\n\nSouthwest Hotels\n\nWorld of Hyatt\n\nAlamo\n\nAvis\n\nBudget\n\nDollar\n\nHertz\n\nNational\n\nPayless\n\nThrifty\n\nEmergency Assistance Plus\n\neRewards\n\nNRG\n\nReliant\n\nRewards for Opinions\n\nTop credit cards that earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points\n\nThere are a range of Southwest credit cards you can use to earn points in this program, and some offer perks that can make flying with the airline a better experience. Here’s a rundown of some of the best Southwest credit cards to consider:\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFrequent flyer programs are free to join, so you can earn rewards with every airline you fly. However, if you’re looking for one program to stick with, the best program for you will depend on which airline you fly with most often.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards offer a lot of flexibility and value, especially for people who can earn and use a Companion Pass. If you aren’t ready to commit to an airline, though, you can still get a lot of mileage for your travel buck with a top travel rewards card, perhaps even one that allows you to transfer miles to your favorite airline, Southwest or otherwise.\n\n*Information about the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card, Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card and Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card has been collected independently by Bankrate.
