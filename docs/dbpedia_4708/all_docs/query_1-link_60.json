        "text": "Few brands ever achieve Cult Status, and no brand in the airline industry can boast a cult following quite like Southwest Airlines.\n\nFrom a small interstate airline operating out of Dallas Texas where the brand was born back in 1967, Southwest now services over 100 destinations across North America and The Caribbean.\n\nA story of hot pants, whisky, peanuts, caring and some light-hearted humour, this article breaks down the Southwest Airlines Brand in this case study.\n\nThe Brand History\n\nThe history of Southwest began in 1967 at a hotel bar in San Antonio, Southwest founders Herb Kelleher and Rollin King took out a napkin and scribbled three points of a triangle representing their novel idea.\n\nAn airline that would connect the three main cities of Texas; Dallas, Huston and San Antonio.\n\nFor 8 years from 1971, Southwest Airlines operated as an interstate only carrier.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1979 when U.S. President Jimmy Carter deregulated air travel in the USA, did Southwest really take off.\n\n40 years later, the Southwest Brand has achieved cult status with its customers with a low cost, low stress no nonsense approach to air travel, which has seen it grow to become the largest airline operating in the U.S.\n\nBut how did it get there. What makes Southwest so different to all the other airline brands out there and why do their customers love them so much?\n\nA Competitive Brand Advantage\n\nFrom the early days in Texas, Southwest has run a tight and efficient ship through their business operations. A competitive advantage they’ve never relinquished.\n\nWhere the airline has really excelled however has been through a deep focus on customer experience, low-cost pricing and logistics solutions.\n\nBut Southwest is not all love cuddles and peanuts.\n\nTheir outside the box thinking and innovation has moved the industry forward and their development of company culture has positioned them as an airline their motivated employees believe in.\n\nHelpful Brand Personnel\n\nWe’ve all had bad experiences with air travel.\n\nHaving emigrated to Australia in 2001, I have traveled back to my home country of Ireland more times than I can remember so I’m well versed on how airline staff impact the travel experience.\n\nSome make you feel like you’ve asked them to walk over hot coals when all you’ve asked for is an extra pillow, while others make you feel like they’d actually walk over hot coals for you.\n\nSouthwest understands this gripe and has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure the people they hire are aligned with the brand experience.\n\nHelpfulness is a core value of the brand and ensuring their employees are the most helpful in the industry has given them a distinct advantage.\n\nPricing Less And Rewarding More\n\nMore often than not, a better overall brand experience is a differentiation strategy that comes with a premium price.\n\nAnd it makes sense. If you want the best services you can’t expect to pay the lowest price. Price and quality are the usual trade-off.\n\nNot only do Southwest offer one of the best experiences in the business, they do it with the lowest prices which is a brand advantage accessible to them via their low operating cost strategy.\n\nCase Study:\n\nTarget Market\n\nCommercial airline travel emerged after the Second World War though this wasn’t an inexpensive experience.\n\nThere were multiple classes including luxurious lounges where three course meals were served on bone china with champagne in crystal glasses.\n\nAir travel up to the late 60’s was an exclusive luxury reserved for those who weren’t short of a dollar.\n\nWhen Southwest emerged, they shook up the industry as the first “Budget Airline”.\n\nAccording to MBLM:\n\nSouthwest has been able to distinguish itself and cultivate Brand Intimacy, creating a significant advantage because consumers are more willing to engage with, use, and pay a premium for intimate brands. Whether it is the heart logo or the focus on customer service, Southwest’s brand is built on an emotional foundation that is uncommon among travel brands.\n\nMost notably, Southwest Airlines is by far the most intimate travel brand with the market segment earning under $100k. A sure sign of their strong position in the market for their intended target audience."
