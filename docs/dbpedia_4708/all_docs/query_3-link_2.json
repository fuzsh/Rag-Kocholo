With no assigned seating and two free checked bags for every passenger, the airline eschews traditional status levels in favor of a more egalitarian approach.\n\nThe airline’s loyalty program, Rapid Rewards, has transformed over the years alongside the company and has become a strong currency in the frequent flyer world."
