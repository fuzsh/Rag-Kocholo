(You’ll earn 1,500 for each $5,000 in purchases annually. “Annually” means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and each 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date.) TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account. The following will not count toward qualification for A-List or A-List Preferred status: Rapid Rewards program enrollment points; Rapid Rewards reward flights; Rapid Rewards Companion Pass® travel; Rapid Rewards partner points except for TQPs earned on the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase; Rapid Rewards bonus points, unless specifically designated as such; non-revenue travel, unless specifically designated as eligible; stops at intermediate cities on connecting or through flights; and charter flights. TQPs are not redeemable for travel on Southwest® or through the “More Rewards” site. Eligible credit cards: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card or Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card.\n\nTier Qualifying Points For Business Cards: Tier qualifying points (TQPs) are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest Airlines® or when you, or an employee, use the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. (You’ll earn 1,500 for each $5,000 in purchases annually. “Annually” means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and each 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date.) TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account. The following will not count toward qualification for A-List or A-List Preferred status: Rapid Rewards program enrollment points; Rapid Rewards reward flights; Rapid Rewards Companion Pass® travel; Rapid Rewards partner points except for TQPs earned on the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase; Rapid Rewards bonus points, unless specifically designated as such; non-revenue travel, unless specifically designated as eligible; stops at intermediate cities on connecting or through flights; and charter flights. TQPs are not redeemable for travel on Southwest® or through the “More Rewards” site. Eligible credit cards: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card or Southwest Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card.\n\nPriority Check In And Security Lane Access: For a complete list of available Fly By® locations, visit opens overlaySouthwest.com/flyby.\n\nSame-Day Standby: If there’s an open seat on a different flight that departs on the same calendar day as your original flight and it’s between the same cities, A-List and A-List Preferred Members can get a seat on the new flight free of airline charges. If there isn’t an open seat on this different flight, you can ask a Southwest Gate Agent to add you to the same-day standby list for a flight between the same city pairs that departs on the same calendar day prior to your originally scheduled flight, and you will receive a message if you are cleared on the flight. For both the same-day change and same-day standby benefits, you must change your flight or request to be added to the same-day standby list at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of your original flight or the no-show policy will apply. Based on the flight status contact preference selected during booking, the message regarding your standby status will be an email or text message with a link to access the boarding pass via the Southwest app, mobile web, or you can visit a Southwest Gate Agent to print off the boarding pass. If there are any government taxes and fees associated with these itinerary changes, you will be required to pay those. Your original boarding position is not guaranteed. Important: These benefits are available only by seeing a Southwest Gate Agent or calling 1-800-I-FLY-SWA®. If you change your flight through any other channel or to a flight that does not meet the requirements outlined above, you will be responsible for the difference in price. If an A-List or A-List Preferred Member is traveling on a multiple-Passenger reservation, same-day standby and same-day change will not be provided for non-A-List or non-A-List Preferred Members in the same reservation. For A-List and A-List Preferred Members who have also qualified for a Companion Pass®, A-List, and A-List Preferred benefits are not available to the Companion unless the Companion is also an A-List or A-List Preferred Member.\n\nCompanion Pass: Companion Pass® qualifying points are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest®, points earned on Rapid Rewards® Credit Cards, and base points earned from Rapid Rewards partners. The following do not count as Companion Pass qualifying points: purchased points; points transferred between Members; points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, e-Rewards®, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club®; points earned from Rapid Rewards program enrollment, tier bonus points; flight bonus points; and partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase). No points nor tier or Companion Pass qualifying points will be awarded for flights taken by the Companion when flying on a Companion Pass reservation. Points earned during a billing cycle on a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card from Chase are not available for redemption or qualification for Companion Pass status until they are posted on your billing statement and posted to your Rapid Rewards account. Only points posted on your billing statements and posted to your Rapid Rewards account during the same calendar year are available for qualification for Companion Pass status. For example, if you make a purchase after your December billing statement cycle date, the points on those purchases will not count toward Companion Pass status in the year the purchase was made; they will appear on your January billing statement and post to your Rapid Rewards account in January. Companion Pass Qualifying Points Boost: As a Southwest Rapid Rewards Cardmember, you will earn one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points each calendar year. The boost will be deposited into your eligible Rapid Rewards account by January 31st each calendar year or up to 30 days after account opening. To receive Companion Pass qualifying points boost your credit card account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Only one credit card account per Southwest Rapid Rewards Member (Rapid Rewards Member must be the primary Cardmember on that account), is eligible for one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points per calendar year. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is not responsible for the provision of, or failure to provide, the stated benefits and services.\n\nPaying Bills Online And Automatic Payments: Please contact your service merchant for details on any fees that may be associated with paying your bill using a credit card.\n\nAdding An Employee Card: If any employees are allowed to use the account, they will be authorized users and will have equal charging privileges unless individual spending limits are established for them. You, as the Authorizing Officer, together with the business are responsible for any use of the account by you, an authorized user or anyone else permitted to use the account. You, together with the business, are responsible for repaying all balances on the account. All correspondence, including statements and notifications, will be sent to you as the Authorizing Officer. By requesting to add an employee cardholder to the account, you represent all information provided is accurate and is for persons with which the business has a relationship. You also represent that the business has permission to provide the employee information to Chase and to add the employee as a cardholder. If Chase determines any information provided is fraudulent, Chase has the right to close the account.\n\nSOUTHWEST RAPID REWARDS® PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Credit Card is brought to you by Southwest Airlines® and Chase. Southwest Airlines is responsible for the redemption of Rapid Rewards points toward benefits and services. The number of points needed for a particular Southwest flight is set by Southwest® and will vary depending on destination, time, day of travel, demand, fare type, point redemption rate, and other factors, and are subject to change at any time until the booking is confirmed. Rapid Rewards points can only be transferred to the primary Cardmember’s Rapid Rewards account. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at opens overlaySouthwest.com/rrterms. Southwest reserves the right to amend, suspend, or change the program and/or program rules at any time without notice. Rapid Rewards Members do not acquire property rights in accrued points.\n\nEnd overlay."
