        "text": "Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards is a unique loyalty program that shares some characteristics common of airline loyalty programs (like priority check-in and boarding for elite members) and additional key features (like the ability to bring a companion for free when you’ve earned enough points in a calendar year and points that never expire). This guide is designed to include everything you need to know about the Southwest Rapid Rewards program.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Overview\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards shares traits that are common to most airline rewards programs:\n\nEarn points from paid flights (based on the cost of the fare)\n\nUse points to book free flight awards (and cash+points rewards, starting in 2024).\n\nThe cost, in points, for free flights depends upon the cash price of the flight\n\nThose who spend a lot on paid flights earn elite status.\n\nThere are two elite status levels: A-list and A-list Preferred. The higher your status, the more perks you get.\n\nBranded credit cards can be used to earn points and to help earn elite status.\n\nRapid Rewards also has a few traits that are unique:\n\nIf you earn 135,000 Rapid Rewards points in a calendar year, you earn a Companion Pass. The Companion Pass allows a companion to fly with you for free (paying only the taxes) every time you fly whether the primary passholder’s ticket was purchased with money or points. See more detail in our Southwest Companion Pass Complete Guide.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points never expire\n\nAward flights are highly flexible and can be cancelled or changed with no fee up until 10 minutes prior to departure\n\nHow To Earn Southwest Rapid Rewards Points\n\nMembers can earn points through paid flight activity, credit card spend and bonuses, and many types of partner activity (including the shopping portal, car rentals with partners, flower delivery, and more). Southwest Rapid Rewards points do not expire, which means there is low risk in collecting points.\n\nOn paid flights, members earn points based on fare type and price:\n\nWanna Get Away Fares: Earn 6x points per $1 of base fare\n\nWanna Get Away Plus Fares: Earn 8x points per $1 of base fare\n\nAnytime Fares: Earn 10x points per $1 of base fare\n\nBusiness Select fares: Earn 12x points per $1 of base fare\n\nElite members earn bonuses (A-list gets 25% bonus points, A-list Preferred gets 100% bonus).\n\nPartner activity that can increase your points balance includes:\n\nCredit card spend\n\nCredit card bonuses (including new cardmember welcome bonuses and any short-term spending bonuses)\n\nHotel partners\n\nRental Car partners\n\nRapid Rewards dining\n\n1-800 Flowers (1,000 miles per order of $29.99 or more with promo code R22)\n\nMarathon gas stations\n\nDo Southwest Rapid Rewards points expire?\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points never expire, so there is no activity necessary to keep them alive. Note that if you close your account, you will forfeit any points in the account at time of closure.\n\nHow much are Southwest Rapid Rewards points worth?\n\nOur Reasonable Redemption Value for Southwest Rapid Rewards points is 1.4c each. However, the actual value of points varies based on the price of the flight and route. In short, points are tend be worth slightly more towards cheaper fares and certain international routes where taxes make up a more significant portion of the cost.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Rapid Rewards award flights\n\nAll seats available for sale on a Southwest Airlines flight can be booked with points as an award ticket. The number of points required for a flight depends on the cash price of the fare and points can be used regardless of fare type (“Wanna Get Away”, “Wanna Get Away Plus,” “Anytime”, and “Business Select” fares are all available using points).\n\nA unique feature of the Southwest Rapid Rewards program is the flexibility of award tickets: awards can be cancelled up 10 minutes before the flight is scheduled to depart for no fee. Points are immediately re-deposited into your Southwest Rapid Rewards account. Flights can alternatively be changed just as easily, sometimes without even paying a fare difference.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Elite status Overview\n\nSouthwest offers two levels of elite status: A-list and A-list Preferred. Companion Pass is arguably a third level of elite status, though it comes with no elite benefits other than the companion ticket so we’ll cover that separately in this guide. Requirements for A-list and A-list Preferred status are straightforward and benefits are similar\n\nA-list\n\nRequirements: 20 one-way qualifying flights or 35,000 tier-qualifying points\n\nBenefits:\n\nPriority boarding (the system automatically assigns a position 36 hours before your flight (same as Early Bird check-in).\n\n25% bonus points earned on paid fares (15x Business Select, 12.5x Anytime, 7.5x Wanna Get Away)\n\nFree same-day standby (note that this does not extend to any companions on the same reservation)\n\nFree same-day change\n\nPriority check-in and security (where available)\n\nA-list Preferred\n\nRequirements: 40 one-way qualifying flights or 70,000 tier-qualifying points\n\nBenefits:\n\nPriority boarding (the system automatically assigns a position 36 hours before your flight (same as Early Bird check-in). A-list Preferred receives priority over A-list but both are behind Business Select passengers\n\n100% bonus points on paid fares (24x Business Select, 20x Anytime, 12x Wanna Get Away)\n\nFree same-day standby (note that this does not extend to any companions on the same reservation)\n\nFree same-day change\n\nPriority check-in and security (where available)\n\nFree in-flight Wi-Fi\n\nTwo free premium drinks per flight on flights of 176 miles or longer\n\nShortcuts to Southwest Rapid Rewards elite status\n\nRapid Rewards Premier, Premier Business, Priority, or Performance Business cardmembers earn 1,500 tier points for every $5,000 in purchases on a Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card. That’s a 50% decrease in required spend from previous years. Those who spend their way toward a Companion Pass will find themselves racking up tier points far more quickly in the new system.\n\nSouthwest Companion Pass Overview\n\nThe key details of the Southwest Companion Pass are:\n\nA member who earns 135,000 Rapid Rewards points in a single calendar year earns a Companion Pass, enabling the pass holder to bring a companion for free (the companion just pays the taxes)\n\nThe companion can be changed up to 3 times per calendar year\n\nAs long as a seat is available for sale on the flight, a Companion Pass holder can add their companion. The same fare type does not need to be available.\n\nThe Southwest Airlines Companion Pass can be an extremely valuable tool given that it enables the primary passholder to bring a free companion an unlimited number of times whether the passholder’s flight was purchased with money or points (the primary passholder’s ticket can even be purchased with points from someone else’s account and they can still add the companion for free). It’s worth noting that the companion can be added at any time up until 10 minutes before departure as long as there are seats available for sale and regardless of the fare type originally purchased. In other words, if the primary pass holder buys a Wanna Get Away fare, their companion can still be added even if only Business Select fares remain for sale.\n\nThe 135,000 points required for a Companion Pass can be earned from paid flights, credit card spend, credit card welcome bonuses, or many types of partner activity including shopping portal purchases and rental cars.\n\nShortcuts to a Southwest Companion Pass\n\nThe Companion Pass has a multitude of shortcuts. The most popular shortcut is via new credit card bonuses since even the new member spending bonus counts toward the 135K points that must be earned in a calendar year to get the Companion Pass and Southwest cardholders get credit for 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points each year (note that these are not redeemable points, it is effectively just a reduction in the number of additional points you must earn). For instance, if a member were to open a Southwest consumer credit card and a Southwest business credit card and they each featured an offer like 60,000 points after spending $3,000 in 3 months, opening both cards and meeting the associated spending requirements in the same calendar year would yield 126K total points. Together with the 10K Companion Pass Qualifying points automatically credited to cardholders, such an individual would have 136K Companion Pass Qualifying points – enough for a Companion Pass.\n\nHowever, there are also many other ways to earn Companion Pass qualifying points. In practice, we have found that the following things do count:\n\nPaid flight activity\n\nPoints earned from credit card spend, including the signup bonus\n\nPoints earned from the Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping portal (however, seasonal bonuses from the portal do not count)\n\nMost (but not all) points earned from partners\n\nKeep in mind that you do not need to earn all of the points from a single source — mix and match points from each of these shortcuts as you please.\n\nWhich points qualify toward the Southwest Companion Pass?\n\nCredit card welcome offers\n\nChase frequently offers valuable welcome offers for signing up for their Southwest cards and meeting the minimum spend. There are several versions of the Southwest credit cards. In terms of consumer/personal credit cards, there are three: the Premier, Plus, and Priority cards. On the business side, there is the Premier Business and the Performance Business. Welcome offers on these cards increase and decrease throughout the year and have historically ranged from 40,000 points to 80,000 points, which means that it is often possible to earn enough points for a companion pass, or very close to it, by opening two credit cards and meeting the minimum spending requirements. Here is the current offer information on each of the Southwest credit cards:\n\nCard Offer\n\nUp to 120K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n80K points after $5K spend within first 3 months and an additional 40K after $15K total spend within first 9 months.$199 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n50K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$69 Annual Fee\n\nAfter clicking through, be sure to manually select the exact Southwest card in which you are interested. This card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n50K points ⓘ Non-Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$99 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is known to be subject to Chase's 5/24 rule.\n\nInformation about this card has been collected independently by Frequent Miler. The issuer did not provide the details, nor is it responsible for their accuracy.\n\n50K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$149 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is known to be subject to Chase's 5/24 rule.\n\nUp to 120K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n60K points after $3K spend within first 3 months and an additional 60K after $15K total spend within first 9 months.$99 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\nIt is important to note that Chase added new rules on the Southwest credit cards in recent years. Each of the Southwest credit cards now carries 24-month language. In a nutshell\n\nYou are ineligible for the welcome bonus on a Southwest personal credit card if you currently have any Southwest Rapid Rewards personal credit card or have earned a new cardmember bonus on any Southwest personal credit card in the past 24 months\n\nYou are ineligible for the welcome bonus on a Southwest business credit card if you currently have that specific Southwest Rapid Rewards business credit card or have earned a new cardmember bonus on that specific Southwest business credit card in the past 24 months. This is a key distinction: the verbiage on the application page does not preclude you from earning the welcome bonus on a second business credit card, it just needs to be the other product.\n\nIn short, the easiest path to earn the Companion Pass via credit card welcome offers requires opening at least one business card.\n\nApplying for Business Credit Cards\n\nYes, you have a business: In order to sign up for a business credit card, you must have a business. That said, it's common for people to have businesses without realizing it. If you sell items at a yard sale, or on eBay, for example, then you have a business. Similar examples include: consulting, writing (e.g. blog authorship, planning your first novel, etc.), handyman services, owning rental property, renting on airbnb, driving for Uber or Lyft, etc. In any of these cases, your business is considered a Sole Proprietorship unless you form a corporation of some sort.\n\nWhen you apply for a business credit card as a sole proprietor, you can use your own name as your business name, use your own address and phone as the business' address and phone, and your social security number as the business' Tax ID / EIN. Alternatively, you can get a proper Tax ID / EIN from the IRS for free, in about a minute, through this website.\n\nIs it OK to use business cards for personal expenses? Anecdotally, almost everyone I know uses business cards for personal expenses. That said, the terms in most business card applications state that you should use the card only for business use. Also, some consumer credit card protections do not apply to business cards. My advice: don't use the card for personal expenses if you're not comfortable doing so.\n\nIdeally, you would time the applications and spend so that the points would be earned as early in a calendar year as possible. That way, you’ll have the Companion Pass for nearly two years.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points post to your Southwest Airlines account upon statement close. Timing out purchases in order to earn points from welcome offers at the appropriate time is fairly easy to do. For example, if you would like to earn the welcome bonus on a card in January, be sure to wait to meet the minimum spending requirements until after your December statement closes (since purchase activity after your December statement has closed should post to your Southwest account upon the close of your January statement). The safest bet is of course to wait until January to meet the minimum spending requirement to avoid the risk of points posting early.\n\nIf you open more than one Southwest credit card in close proximity to each other for the purposes of earning the Companion Pass, be sure to time the spend so that you earn both bonuses in the same calendar year. If you choose to pursue such a strategy late in the year with the goal of earning welcome bonuses in January, be careful not to meet the spending threshold early. A member who earns 63,000 points in December and another 63,000 points in January will not have a companion pass since the points were not earned in the same calendar year.\n\nUnfortunately, Chase does apply its 5/24 rule to these cards. That means that you most likely won’t get approved if you’ve opened 5 or more cards (with any bank) in the past 24 months.\n\nChase's 5/24 Rule: With most Chase credit cards, Chase will not approve your application if you have opened 5 or more cards with any bank in the past 24 months.\n\nTo determine your 5/24 status, see: 3 Easy Ways to Count Your 5/24 Status. The easiest option is to track all of your cards for free with Travel Freely.\n\nCredit card spend\n\nIf you’re a big spender, then another way to get the Companion Pass is to simply charge $135,000 worth of expenses on a Southwest credit card (or cards) during a single calendar year.\n\nSince the cards only award 1 point per dollar on most spend, this wouldn’t be the fastest way to earn the Companion Pass, nor the cheapest in terms of opportunity cost. However, if you know you’ll use the Companion Pass a ton, it might be worth it to you.\n\n1-800-Flowers\n\n1-800-Flowers lets you earn 1,000 Companion Pass qualifying Southwest points per order with promo code RR22. To qualify, orders must be $29.99 or more and only one promo code can be used per order. The terms of this deal have been updated to indicate that you can only receive these points a maximum of 12 times per year (i.e. max of 12,000 points).\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nIf you do a lot of online shopping, you can earn points that qualify for the Companion Pass by shopping through the Southwest Rapid Rewards shopping portal. The portal offers different point bonuses for different stores. It’s often possible to earn 5 or more points per dollar for shopping at popular merchants. Note that points from seasonal portal bonuses (such as “Spend $300, get 500 bonus points”) do not count towards the Companion Pass.\n\nHotel partners\n\nSouthwest Airlines has several hotel partners (as seen on this page). Some hotel partners only allow for points transfer, but others allow you to earn Southwest points for your stays. These points are Companion Pass-qualifying.\n\nFor example, Southwest has a partnership with MGM Rewards whereby you can earn 600 Rapid Rewards points per stay at most of the MGM hotels in Las Vegas. As shown above, these points count towards the Companion Pass.\n\nBook hotels through Rocketmiles\n\nRocketmiles is a hotel booking site that rewards you with airline miles in lieu of earning hotel points, elite credit, etc. You choose the type of miles you want to earn and then the search results show the price of the hotel per night and the number of miles you can earn. If you pick Southwest Rapid Rewards, then it’s possible to earn Companion Pass qualifying points for your stay.\n\nUnfortunately, Rocketmiles promotional bonuses are not Companion Pass qualifying points. In the above example, it shows the number “5,000” crossed out and replaced with “8,000 Rapid Rewards Points”. In this case, you would probably earn 5,000 Companion Pass qualifying points — the other 3,000 bonus are most likely a bonus. Also keep in mind that you will not earn hotel points or elite credit for bookings made through RocketMiles. If you have elite status with the hotel chain, it will probably not be recognized, so you will not receive benefits of your status like free breakfast.\n\nRental Cars\n\nSouthwest Airlines partners with a number of rental car companies to offer points for renting through Southwest (see the current list here). Always be sure to compare the cost using any associated rate codes. Base points earned from car rentals do count toward the Southwest Companion Pass, but be aware that additional bonuses beyond base points may not.\n\nReferring friends\n\nChase sometimes offers bonuses for referring friends to apply for a card you have. You can check to see if you have any referral offers by entering your last name, billing zip code, and the last four digits of your Southwest card here. Typically, you can earn 10,000 Rapid Rewards points per referral up to a maximum of 50,000 points per year. What’s more, your Southwest credit card referral link can now be used to refer someone to any Southwest credit card. In other words, if you have the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Premier credit card, you could refer someone to the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Performance Business credit card or vice versa. This opens up more possibilities in terms of earning referral points.\n\nIt is furthermore noteworthy that referrals collected late in the year can be an interesting way to earn toward the pass. We discovered that referrals earned after your December statement closes but before December 31st will count toward the current year’s Chase referral cap, but will not post to your Southwest Rapid Rewards account until your next statement cuts (in January). One could therefore essentially double up on Companion Pass-eligible points by doing the following:\n\nMake sure your Southwest credit card statement cut date is set for early in December. As an example, let’s say your December statement posts on December 10th\n\nRefer 5 friends between December 11th-December 31st (50,000 point cap for this calendar year)\n\nRefer 5 more friends between January 1-January 9th (50,000 point cap for the new calendar year)\n\nWhen your statement cuts again on January 10th, your Southwest account would theoretically be credited with 100,000 referral points from a single credit card (50K “earned” the previous calendar year from Chase’s perspective and 50K “earned” from the current calendar year, but all posted to your Southwest account in the same calendar year)\n\nAgain, the trick here is to make sure not to refer people to apply until after your December statement cut date. For more information on this method, see: An unexpected path to the Companion Pass.\n\nWhat doesn’t count towards a Companion Pass\n\nThe most notable sources of non-qualifying points include: transfers from hotel partners and those transferred from Chase Ultimate Rewards. These points will NOT count towards earning a Southwest Companion Pass.\n\nSouthwest states that:\n\nPurchased points, transferred points transferred between members, points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, and e-Rewards, e-Miles, Valued Opinions and Diners Club, points earned from program enrollment, tier bonus points, flight bonus points, and partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase) do not qualify as Companion Pass Qualifying Points.\n\nIt is also important to note that bonus points at many partners do not count. Base points earned from partners do count in many instances — such as the 1,000 points with the 1800Flowers coupon code above, base RocketMiles points, etc. However, an extra added bonus may not count. You can easily go to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account and click “Recent Activity”, then filter by “Companion Pass qualifying points” to verify which transactions count toward your current total.\n\nSharing points with others\n\nYou can transfer points to another member, but Southwest charges a fee to do so. Instead, you can simply use your points to book a flight for someone else whether or not you will travel with them. Note that if you use your points to book a flight for someone who has a Companion Pass, he or she can still add their companion for free. There is little reason to consider paying for a transfer.\n\nSouthwest “More Rewards”: International flights, experiences, and more\n\nSouthwest credit card holders have access to additional redemption opportunities via “More Rewards”. These opportunities generally yield less value per point than redeeming for Southwest flights, but it opens the possibility to use points for international flights (including in premium cabins), experiences, gift cards and more. Card holders can click through the link on this page and log in to view options.\n\nInternational flights can only be booked on routes that are not served by Southwest and it is possibly that some carriers may not be available. However, based on sample searches, it appears that flights can be booked at a value of approximately 1c per point. Flights do not need to be to/from the United States (for example, a flight from Germany to Spain or Hong Kong to Bangkok can be booked via the air portal.\n\nYou can also use points to pay for car rentals, experiences, vacation packages, and even travel insurance, though values tend to be quite poor.\n\nSouthwest Credit Cards\n\nChase issues quite a few Southwest Airlines consumer and business credit cards. Current offer information for these cards can be found below:\n\nCard Offer\n\nUp to 120K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n80K points after $5K spend within first 3 months and an additional 40K after $15K total spend within first 9 months.$199 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n50K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$69 Annual Fee\n\nAfter clicking through, be sure to manually select the exact Southwest card in which you are interested. This card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\n50K points ⓘ Non-Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$99 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is known to be subject to Chase's 5/24 rule.\n\nInformation about this card has been collected independently by Frequent Miler. The issuer did not provide the details, nor is it responsible for their accuracy.\n\n50K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n50K points after $1K spend in the first 3 months.$149 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is known to be subject to Chase's 5/24 rule.\n\nUp to 120K points ⓘ Affiliate\n\n60K points after $3K spend within first 3 months and an additional 60K after $15K total spend within first 9 months.$99 Annual Fee\n\nThis card is subject to Chase's 5/24 rule (click here for details).\n\nIt is important to note that Chase added new rules on the Southwest credit cards in recent years. Each of the Southwest credit cards now carries 24-month language. In a nutshell\n\nYou are ineligible for the welcome bonus on a Southwest personal credit card if you currently have any Southwest Rapid Rewards personal credit card or have earned a new cardmember bonus on any Southwest personal credit card in the past 24 months\n\nYou are ineligible for the welcome bonus on a Southwest business credit card if you currently have that specific Southwest Rapid Rewards business credit card or have earned a new cardmember bonus on that specific Southwest business credit card in the past 24 months. This is a key distinction: the verbiage on the application page does not preclude you from earning the welcome bonus on a second business credit card, it just needs to be the other product.\n\nThose looking to earn a Companion Pass via credit card welcome offers will need to open at least one business card.\n\nSouthwest Check in process\n\nOne of the most polarizing features of Southwest is the check in and boarding process. Love it or hate it, Southwest does not assign seats and instead assigns boarding positions based on a number of factors, most notably when a customer checks in. This means that if you want a favorable boarding position so you can choose the aisle/window seat you want, you’ll need to check in as early as possible. Online check in begins 24 hours prior to departure, but Southwest also offers Early Bird Check In.\n\nEarly Bird Check-In\n\nFor a fee that starts at $15, Southwest will automatically check you in beginning 36 hours before your flight — 12 hours before general check in opens. They will prompt you to add Early Bird Check-in on the booking confirmation page:\n\nAlternatively, you can always add it later on by clicking on a reservation in your account and then clicking the button to add early bird check-in.\n\nHowever, there is one notable problem with early bird check in: If you cancel your reservation, you will lose the money you paid for early bird check in. Normally, if you cancel a paid reservation with Southwest, you receive a credit that doesn’t expire. If you booked your ticket on points, you can choose to have the taxes refunded to your original payment method. However, if you paid for early bird check in and you cancel your ticket, you get neither a refund nor a credit for the Early Bird Check-in fee. If you simply change your flight, you keep Early Bird Check-in. For this reason, I never add Early Bird Check-in until I’m sure that plans are firm. Also, I typically only add Early Bird Check-in to my ticket (the primary traveler, not the companion). There are a few reasons for this strategy:\n\nIf ticket prices drop, Southwest will allow you to change/re-book at the lower fare and receive a refund of the difference in points or a credit if you paid the cash price.\n\nCompanions receive sequential boarding so that they get boarding positions next to or very close to each other. Since that is the case, only one needs to purchase Early Bird Check-In and the 2nd person will automatically get the benefit. Both passengers do need need to check-in.\n\nIf you get bumped from your flight, you will lose early bird check in and will not get a refund of that fee.\n\nThe utility of early bird check in can depend on your origination point.\n\nEarly Bird Check-in might not be worth it\n\nThe usefulness of Early Bird Check-in will likely depend on two main factors: whether or not you have a seat preference and your point of origin.\n\nSouthwest only flies the Boeing 737, though they fly several different variants of that plane. The smallest version they fly has 23 rows. Assuming that aisle seats and window seats are equally desirable, that means that there are about 92 “preferred” seats on even the smallest planes (23 aisle seats and 23 window seats on each side of the aisle). Each Boarding group has 60 people. Therefore, everyone in Boarding Group A will get a preferred seat if they want it. Since at least some of the people in Groups A and B will be traveling together (and therefore someone in the party will take a middle seat next to their companion), I think it’s generally true that nearly everyone in Group B will have access to a preferred seat as well. By the time Group C gets on board, it is much more likely that only middle seats are left. In my experience, checking in exactly 24 hours before the flight often (though not always) produces a Group B boarding pass.\n\nHowever, that may vary a bit depending on the second factor: your point of origin. Southwest normally allows you to check in 24 hours before your scheduled departure. When you check in for your first segment, you are automatically checked in for all of your segments that day. This results in an advantage for those passengers who are not based in Southwest hubs.\n\nLet’s consider that you are based somewhere in the Northeast — like Albany, NY. Southwest only flies a couple of direct routes out of Albany. Most itineraries from Albany connect in Baltimore, Chicago, or Orlando. So let’s take this Albany, NY to Los Angeles, CA itinerary as an example:\n\nThe initial flight (Southwest Flight #6542) leaves Albany at 5:40am on Friday morning. There is a connection in Baltimore to Southwest Flight #1951 — that flight leaves Baltimore at 8:05am. Since passengers can check in 24 hours before their initial flight, a passenger starting in Albany can check in for both flights together at 5:40am on Thursday. This means the Albany passenger will be checked in for that second flight from Baltimore to Los Angeles 2 hours and 20 minutes before someone originating in Baltimore is able to check in online. Of course, it’s not only passengers from Albany that have an advantage. Passengers originating in Boston get a 10-mintue head start on Albany — their first flight is at 5:30am. Those folks starting in Manchester, NH are going to beat Boston and Albany with their 5:15am departure:\n\nThe point here is that if you live in Manchester, NH, you probably don’t need Early Bird Check-in. If you can check in right at 5:15am 24 hours in advance, you only have to contend with folks originating in Manchester on your first flight and you will be among the first checking in on the Baltimore segment. You have a nice head start on the people who live in Baltimore.\n\nOf course, on the flip side, this means that people who live in Baltimore may need to pay for Early Bird Check-in to have any chance at a decent boarding position. The people in Manchester, Boston, and Albany who also paid for Early Bird Check-in will continue to have a head start. However, those originating in Baltimore can put themselves ahead of the 24-hour check ins from Albany, Boston, Manchester, etc by paying for Early Bird Check-in. Therefore, if you live in a Southwest hub city, you may want to consider paying the premium.\n\nSouthwest Business Select Overview\n\nSouthwest sells Business Select fares that include priority security and A1-A15 boarding. While these tickets are generally much more expensive than Wanna Get Away fares, they are sometimes not much more than “Anytime” fares – so if you’re booking close to departure, they can be a better value in terms of securing a good boarding position and priority security in some airports. These fares also include a free premium drink and earn more miles per dollar. They are refundable as well.\n\nHowever, note that if you book business select, your companion will not (yet) share your favorable boarding position. He or she will still need to check in as usual (or purchase Early Bird Boarding or an upgraded boarding position at the gate). Southwest has done trials of a a program where the companion will board with the Companion Pass holder in the Companion Pass holder’s boarding position when flying on a Business Select fare. This program could be expanded in the future, so keep your eye out for details.\n\nFAQ\n\nHere are a few other common questions that people ask about the Southwest Companion Pass:\n\nQ: Can I change my flight on a companion booking?\n\nA: Yes. You will first need to cancel the companion’s reservation. You can then change the primary traveler’s flight.\n\nQ: How soon are my points refunded for a canceled booking?\n\nA: Immediately. Points go directly back into your account and do not expire.\n\nQ: Can a companion pass holder cancel the companion’s reservation if he/she cannot travel with me?\n\nA: Yes. You can cancel their reservation and either receive a refund of the taxes or keep them as a credit to use on a future flight. Note that you need to choose the option to refund to your credit card rather than as travel funds if that is what you prefer.\n\nQ: Can a Companion Pass holder’s companion travel without the primary passholder?\n\nA: NO! The terms of the program explicitly forbid the companion from flying without the primary traveler and Southwest will likely revoke your companion pass if you do this. It is theoretically possible to do — both travelers check in and only the companion shows up — but will almost certainly get you in trouble with Southwest. Furthermore, if the itinerary is round trip, the companion might have his/her return flight cancelled. Don’t do this.\n\nQ: Does my companion earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points?\n\nA: No, they do not. The primary traveler does earn points on a paid reservation (not a reservation made on points).\n\nQ: What happens to my companion’s reservations if I change my companion?\n\nA: You must first cancel your companion’s reservations before changing companions.\n\nQ: Can I book a round trip flight that begins before my Companion Pass expires on December 31st, but returns after the pass has expired?\n\nA: This isn’t possible. Southwest won’t let you add a companion to a reservation that extends beyond the pass validity period. You would have to book a one-way in December (you could add your companion to this reservation) and then a one-way returning in the new year where you pay for both seats.\n\nQ: Is there an advantage to booking one-way flights or round trip flights with the Southwest Companion Pass?\n\nA: It makes more sense to book one-way flights with Southwest in general. In the vast majority of cases, the round trip price (at least on domestic flights within the US) is simply the cumulative total of the two one-way flights. You will enjoy greater flexibility in making changes to one segment or the other if you book one-way flights.\n\nQ: What are some of the best uses of the Southwest Companion Pass?\n\nA: This is obviously completely subjective. Obviously, you can enjoy some cheaper trips around the US. Southwest also flies to a growing number of international destinations, including:\n\nAruba\n\nBelize\n\nCabo San Lucas/Los Cabos, Mexico\n\nCancun, Mexico\n\nCuba\n\nGrand Cayman Island\n\nLiberia, Costa Rica\n\nMexico City\n\nMontego Bay, Jamaica\n\nNassau, Bahamas\n\nPuerto Vallarta, Mexico\n\nPunta Cana, Dominican Republic\n\nSan Jose, Costa Rica\n\nAdditionally, you can use Southwest to position for an award flight or cheap flight deal out of a different city. This can be a great option when saver-level awards on American/United/Delta are not available from your city."
