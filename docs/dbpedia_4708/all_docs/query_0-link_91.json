        "text": "Southwest Airlines is expanding its flight pricing to Kayak. Historically, the discount airline hasn’t disclosed fare costs to third-party travel websites, only the flight times. Now, Kayak users can quickly compare flight times and prices against other airlines.\n\nDoes Kayak Include Southwest Airlines?\n\nKayak now lists Southwest Airlines and flight prices on its website and mobile app. Previously, leisure travelers could only view the flight times and were routed to Southwest’s platform to view prices and book a flight.\n\nIt’s possible to compare Southwest’s various fare classes, such as Wanna Get Away and Wanna Get Away Plus. You can also filter results by the cheapest, quickest, or best itinerary.\n\nSouthwest’s prices will be displayed directly in the Kayak search results. As before, Kayak routes you to the Southwest Airlines website after finding a desirable itinerary to pay for the flight with money or points.\n\n“This is a great development for travelers,” says Steve Hafner, CEO. “We first started showing Southwest in 2022 to KAYAK for Business customers. We’re thrilled to expand that relationship to the millions of leisure travelers who use KAYAK.”\n\nThe enhanced pricing transparency on Kayak helps make the already-popular airline more competitive, as it’s significantly easier for bargain hunters to find the best flights for their travel budget.\n\nAdditional travel websites showing Southwest’s fares include Google Flights and Chase Travel (for select cardholders).\n\nOther Recent Southwest Airlines Changes\n\nIn addition to seeing Southwest flight prices on Kayak, the airline made two noteworthy announcements. Most importantly, it’s ending its long-standing open-seating policy and moving to assigned seats in the near future.\n\nFurther, more “red-eye flights” will be offered which can be more affordable, allow flyers to avoid peak travel hours, and increase aircraft usage efficiency.\n\nThankfully, the airline is keeping its two free checked bags policy for every fare.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nKayak is one of the most visited travel search engines, and the additional pricing transparency removes a critical frustration factor for frequent and first-time Southwest Airlines passengers."
