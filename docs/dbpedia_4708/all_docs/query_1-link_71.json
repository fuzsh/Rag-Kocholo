        "text": "Regardless of the airline, having elite status can make travel more comfortable (and certainly less stressful). Some travelers value elite status so much, they go to great lengths to keep it and are devastated if they ever have to give it up or lose it.\n\nIf youâve flown enough to meet the status requirements of an airlineâs frequent flyer program, thereâs probably another airline out there that would love to have you as a loyal customer.\n\nThe new airline might even offer you an incentive to try them on for size. That could be a status match or status challenge â many airlines offer some form of these opportunities for the purpose of luring existing frequent flyers.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is one of several major airlines with a status match program. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and many others have their own status matches/challenges that offer frequent flyers of other airlines a chance to experience corresponding elite benefits for a limited period of time.\n\nSouthwestâs status match is complimentary and immediate on approval. Theyâll also extend your elite status beyond the initial promotional period after you complete minimal additional requirements.\n\nIn this article weâll explain:\n\nHow airline status matches and challenges work\n\nHow Southwestâs status match/challenge program works\n\nThe benefits of having Southwest elite status\n\nHow to request and qualify for the status match/challenge\n\nHow to enhance your new elite status benefits\n\nLetâs get started reviewing everything you need to complete a status match with the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Program.\n\nWhat Is a Status Match and How Does it Work?\n\nIf you have current elite status with an airline and need (or want) to switch to a new airline, that new airline may have a program whereby they will match your status (they want your business, after all!).\n\nYou would submit a request to the new airline including documentation of your current elite status and flight history. The new airline will either approve or deny your request.\n\nIf youâre approved, you might receive immediate elite status for a specific period of time. You may also be required to complete additional activity before you receive the status match, depending on the airlineâs policy.\n\nNote that you donât have to give up your current elite status, nor is it transferred to the new airline. The new matched status would be in addition to your existing elite status.\n\nThe Difference Between a Status Match and a Status Challenge\n\nEach airline has its own procedure for matching airline status. The program could be an immediate status match based on your current corresponding elite status, a requirement that you complete certain activities before they grant you a status match, or a combination of the 2.\n\nStatus Match â The new airline gives you immediate corresponding status for a specific period of time with no further requirements\n\nStatus Match With a Challenge â You receive immediate status and then are required to fly a certain amount of miles (usually in a 90-day period) to have the status extended.\n\nStatus Challenge â You do not receive any status match until you complete the required qualifying activity.\n\nIt is also possible that your status match request will be denied. Possible reasons for denial can include that your current airline is not eligible, your status has expired, or your status was earned by having a credit card or from a previous status match.\n\nHot Tip:Â If you need more clarification, check out our piece â The Ultimate Guide to Airline Status Matches/Challenges.\n\nSouthwestâs Status Match Program\n\nSouthwestâs status match program grants immediate elite status when your request is approved. The airline then requires you to complete a challenge in order to extend your granted elite status for 12 months.\n\nThe Southwest Status Challenge Advantage\n\nSouthwestâs frequent flyer program has 3 levels of elite status opportunities. When your status match request is approved, you are granted A-List level elite status that is valid for 90 days.\n\nHowever, if you go on to complete the status challenge requirements, your elite status will be extended to 12 months. To extend your status, you must complete 3 paid round-trip flights or 6 paid one-way flights within the 90 day period after your status match was approved.\n\nNormally you would need to fly 20 paid one-way flights or accumulate 35,000 points in a 12-month period to secure A-List status.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Points are earned through paid fares, partner purchases, and by using Southwestâs Rapid Rewards credit cards.\n\nBottom Line: Status matches and challenges offer a fast track to elite status for completing requirements that are far less than normal annual requirements. Theyâre a perfect shortcut when you want (or need) to change airlines.\n\nBenefits of Southwest Airlines Elite Status\n\nSouthwest Airlines will grant A-List elite status when you are approved for their status match. With A-List status, you can expect the following benefits:\n\nPriority boarding, check-in, and security lane access\n\n25% bonus points on every qualifying flight\n\nFree same-day flight standby\n\nDedicated customer service phone line\n\nHow and When to Submit a Status Match Request\n\nThe first step in any status match process is to join the new airlineâs frequent flyer program. To join Southwestâs Rapid Rewards program, simplyÂ complete the enrollment form on their website and make note of your new membership number.\n\nCompleting an Individual Traveler Status Match Request\n\nOnce youâve enrolled in Rapid Rewards and secured a membership number, youâll need to take a screenshot or secure a copy of your current elite membership credentials with the other airline.\n\nCreate an email requesting your status match, and include the following information:\n\nFull name\n\nRapid RewardsÂ® number\n\nScreenshot of current elite status with a U.S.-based airline\n\nSubmit your request toÂ southwest.statusmatch@wnco.com. You can expect to receive a reply within 12 business days.\n\nCompleting a Corporate Traveler Status Match Request\n\nIf your company has a corporate travel agreement with Southwest Airlines, you may also be eligible for a status match.\n\nSubmit an email requesting the status match and include the following information:\n\nFull name\n\nRapid RewardsÂ® number\n\nCompany name\n\nYour corporate email address\n\nA screenshot showing your current elite status with a U.S. airline\n\nSubmit your request toÂ rrstatusmatch@wnco.com.\n\nWhen to Submit Your Request\n\nMost airline status matches/challenges favor getting approved and completing challenges late in the year, since your status may be extended through the following calendar year. (Those who finish their challenge early in the year normally receive granted status through the end of the current year.)\n\nFortunately, with Southwest Airlines, you can submit a status match request at any time.\n\nOnce your request is approved, your A-List status will be valid for 90 days. After you have completed the status challenge requirements within that time period, your elite status will be extended 12 months from the date of first approval.\n\nThereâs no need to worry about timing your request for optimum results here.\n\nHot Tip: Need a new credit card? Take a peek at these credit cards that are great for Southwest Airlines flyers.\n\nCompleting the Flying Requirements\n\nTo complete the status challenge, you must book and board the required flights within the 90-day period after your status match is approved. Reservations that were booked prior to your status match approval will not count toward the challenge.\n\nFortunately, Southwest flights can be canceled and re-booked without additional charge.\n\nTo receive A-List benefits while flying, your flights should be booked after your promotional status has been granted and your A-List status shows in your Rapid RewardsÂ© account.\n\nThese must be paid flights, and you will need either 3 round-trip journeys or 6 one-way flights to complete the challenge.\n\nFortunately, Southwest allows you to look up fares for every day of each month with its low fare calendar. If youâre flexible you can save a lot of money on your flights using this tool.\n\nEnhancing Your New Elite Status\n\nHaving an airline credit card delivers benefits you wonât receive with elite status alone. Youâll be earning award tickets faster, receiving discounts/credits, and enjoying additional perks/benefits.\n\nSouthwest Rapid RewardsÂ® Priority Credit Card\n\nIn addition to a generous sign-up bonus, Southwest Priority card will earn 2-3x points on purchases with Southwest and its partners. The card allows you to earn points you can redeem for flights and help you re-qualify for A-List status.\n\nWith perks such as priority boarding, inflight discounts, and an annual travel credit, your new elite status is enhanced immensely by having a Southwest Priority card.\n\n3 points/$1 spent with Southwest purchases\n\n2 points/$1 spent on Southwest hotel and car rental partners\n\n2 points/$1 spent on local transit, commuting, internet, cable, phone, and select streaming services\n\n1 point/$1Â all other purchases\n\n7,500 anniversary points each year\n\n$75Â Southwest annual travel credit\n\n4 upgraded boardings per year\n\n25% backÂ on inflight drinks, Wi-Fi, messaging, and movies\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nEarn tier qualifying points toward A-List Status\n\nEverything Else You Need to Know\n\nCurrent Rapid Rewards A-List members do not qualify for the status match/challenge promotions.\n\nCorporate members can complete the status challenge by obtaining 8,000 Rapid Rewards Points or completing 3 paid round-trip flights or 6 paid one-way flights. Regular members do not have the point option.\n\nIf you complete the higherÂ annual requirements for A-List status (20 one-way paid flights or 35,000 points)Â during the status challenge promotional period (as opposed to just the reduced challenge requirements), the annual A-List status will prevail over granted promotional status.\n\nSouthwestâs status match is not always available.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you hold elite status with any domestic airline, live near an airport serviced by Southwest Airlines, and frequently fly the airline, thereâs no doubt you would benefit from receiving a status match.\n\nStatus matches can start you on the path to a higher elite level while allowing you to enjoy the benefits and perks youâre accustomed to with your current airline.\n\nSince status matches can be limited to once in the lifetime of your account, youâll want to request a status match only when it serves you best. For example, when youâre ready to switch airlines, have extensive travel planned on Southwest, and can use the temporary status as a platform for achieving continued elite status with the new airline."
