        "text": "What are the benefits of booking Carnivals new Fly2FunÂ® Air Program?\n\nThere are several benefits to booking Carnival's Fly2Fun Program. Our new air program allows you to select air options from major carries and flights departing from U.S., Canada, Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America and Europe. Carnival also provides Flight Protection in the event of flight disruptions, providing reassurance that Carnival will make alternate arrangements as needed for guests to meet the ship at the port of embarkation in time to board the ship or to the first port of call (without violating the Jones Act). If no viable options are available to join the ship, guest will be given a Future Cruise Credit to apply towards a future Carnival cruise.\n\nWhere do I go to book air in Carnival.com?\n\nLogin into Manage My Account and select Fly2Fun from 'Shop by Category'.\n\nDo I need to pay my air booking immediately?\n\nGuest who chose Flexible Fares can pay for their air at the time of cruise final payment and will not incur fees if changes (*) are made prior to 60 days of cruise departure. Within 60 days of cruise departure, a $200 change fee will be applied plus any additional air costs.\n\nFor Restricted Fares, airline payment is required once the air reservation is made and tickets are non-refundable.\n\nCan I change from Restricted to Flexible and vice versa?\n\nOur Flexible Fares allow you to make changes prior to 60 days of cruise departure without penalty. Changes made 60 days or less from the cruise departure, changes from Flexible to Restricted will be subject to a $200 change fee plus additional airfare cost. Restricted Fares are non-refundable. Therefore, switching from Restricted Fares to Flexible Fares would be subject to a full penalty.\n\nWho should I contact if I need to change my flights?\n\nYou may call your travel agent or 1-800-321-6666 to change your flights. However, change fees and additional air cost may apply.\n\nCan I change my Fly2Fun flights after they have been booked?\n\nOur Flexible Fares allow you to make changes prior to 60 days from cruise departure without penalty. Changes made 60 days or less from cruise departure will be subject to a $200 change fee as well as any additional air cost. Restricted Fares are non-refundable. Therefore, switching flights on Restricted Fares can only be done within the same day of reservation, without penalty. If an unforeseen situation comes up after the initial day, airline change fees and additional air cost will apply.\n\nIf I have purchased Carnival Vacation Protection and have to cancel, will our air be covered?\n\nFor specifics on protection, please call 1-800-331-2796.\n\nWhat if my flights are cancelled or delayed?\n\nOur Fly2Fun Air Program provides Flight Protection in the event of airline flight cancellations or delays resulting from mechanicals or severe weather conditions. Guests affected by these situations should contact our Travel Hotline at 1-800-529-6792 and our travel professional will make alternate flight, hotel and/or ground transportation arrangements and do everything we can to get you to the port of embarkation in time to board the ship or to the first port of call (without violating the Jones Act). If no viable options are available to join the ship, guest will be given a Future Cruise Credit to apply towards a future Carnival cruise.\n\nIf I purchase Fly2Fun and missed my flights, would Carnival refund my air or re-accommodate us?\n\nWe will not refund air for guests who miss their flights.\n\nIf you are unable to meet the ship due to airline flight cancellations or delays resulting from mechanicals or severe weather conditions, Carnival will make alternate flight, hotel and/or ground transportation arrangements and do everything we can to get you to the port of embarkation in time to board the ship or to the first port of call (without violating the Jones Act). If no viable options are available to join the ship, guest will be given a Future Cruise Credit to apply towards a future Carnival cruise.\n\nWhere can I see my flight schedule?\n\nAn air confirmation will be automatically sent to the e-mail address appearing in the cruise reservation system, which may be your travel agent's e-mail. The flight schedule can also be retrieved via Carnival.com, Manage My Cruise.\n\nHow would I be notified of an airline itinerary change (i.e. time change, flight number, airport, etc.)?\n\nWe will automatically resend an air confirmation reflecting airline schedule changes to the email address on the booking.\n\nCan I cancel my air without a penalty if I change my mind the same day of air confirmation?\n\nUsually the airlines are willing to work with us if the cancellation happens the same day. Please contact your travel agent or 1-800-CARNIVAL to see if a penalty applies.\n\nWill the air confirmation sent at the time of the booking indicate the air program selected (i.e Restricted or Flexible)?\n\nYes. The confirmation will indicate Flexible fare or Restricted fare. The confirmation for Flexible Fares and Restricted Fares will be sent when the air is booked or modified.\n\nIf I have Vacation Protection Plan and I use the \"cancel for any reason\" is the air covered under the 75% Future Cruise Cancel?\n\nYes. Future Cruise Credit (FCC) for 75% of the value of the air cancellation fee applies to both Flexible Fares and Restricted Fares.\n\nWill Flexible Fares and Restricted Fares include price protection?\n\nWe will not be offering air price protection. Only cruise price protection is offered.\n\nIf we have paid for Restricted Fares and then decide later to add a pre or post package, would we incur a penalty or just pay prevailing rates?\n\nAn administration fee will not be applied. Only the charge for the airline change fees and the incremental air cost will apply.\n\nWill my flights automatically be loaded into the travel information section in Online Check-in?\n\nYes. Your flights will be populated in Online Check-in. You will not have to reenter them in the travel information section.\n\nWhat is considered a name change? What is considered a name correction?\n\nA name change is considered a new guest replacing an existing guest. The original guest will be cancelled and the new guest will be added. The new guest would need to shop for air at the prevailing rates."
