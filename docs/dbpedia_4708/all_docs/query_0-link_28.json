        "text": "Given the fierce competition in the airlines industry and the additional competition being offered by the new ultra-low cost carriers, it has become imperative for Southwest Airlines to find a solution that will be sustainable and insulate them verses these and any other future threats. Southwest has initiated a merger proposal with JetBlue that will result in the newly formed SouthwestBlue being much larger and able to compete for control of the North American Continent as the number one provider for customers concerned with both low-cost and excellent customer service. Because both Southwest and JetBlue have similar core values, customer service policies, and business models, it will be an easier merger than it would be for two carriers with drastically different layouts.\n\nThe price competition among airlines remains strong. Levisohn (2017) reported on a price war between LCC Spirit Airlines and network carrier United (UAL), where Spirit Airlines called out Chicago, Houston and Newark as its target markets, and UAL has confirmed it is aggressively defending the above hub markets. It appears that AAL is most at risk in getting caught in the crossfire, as UAL is being very specific about lowering fares only on flights that match up with Spirit's schedule the risk is most likely highest for carriers that have a large amount of capacity in markets where United and Spirit are going head to head.\n\nDecreased online reservation can be a problem: customers like me prefer to purchase ticket via travel agencies to have different options and better deals compare to going directly to an airline website to purchase ticket. Another problem will be how will a loyal customer that earned points/rewards on Expedia or Priceline use the points on Southwest website after the merger? This can be an issue because travel agencies websites offers rewards programs that let you earned points as a frequent flyer and the points can be used for future purchases. In addition, Southwest offers only one option of seating while tickets bought on third party websites have the options of choosing seat like first- class, business class and economy class. That can be an issue for major business travelers who prefer spacious seating, luxury and privacy. After the merging, managers should continue to use travel agency websites in order to boost sales and keep up with competition. Also, managers should to encourage customers to sign up for rewards offer by signing up for a credit card, as it’s a good marketing strategy. Managers should cut down cost by not having to customize AirTran flights and the options of first-class and economy seating should still be offered.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is globalizing their company in order to reach a bigger market, and become competition for other companies. Southwest Airlines has already conquered the domestic market beating American Airlines, United, and Delta according to Fortune. Access to a new market is what motivated Southwest to globalize, they are expanding to the south of North America, with their new assets found in their acquired airline AirTran Airways (LeBeau, 4) . Southwest Airlines has brought low rates and a great experience to the domestic market, which was warmly received, they now plan to dip into global market to bring better service to all.\n\nThe merger between American Airlines and U.S. Airways is one that can be explained using static game theory models. The two players in the game would be American Airlines and U.S. Airways. Each one of the players would have something to gain from the merger, but they would also have something to lose. In this game American Airlines is our first player. American Airlines’ potential payoff is merging with a company that is maximizing profits, but is also lacking in the customer service department. U.S. Airways is player two, and in this game they are merging with a business that is suffering from chapter 11 bankruptcy, but is excelling in customer service.\n\nThe domestic US airline industry has been intensely competitive since it was deregulated in 1978. In a regulated environment, most of the cost increases were passed along to consumers under a fixed rate-of-return based pricing scheme. This allowed labor unions to acquire a lot of power and workers at the major incumbent carriers were overpaid. After deregulation, the incumbent carriers felt the most pain, and the floodgates had opened for newer more nimble carriers with lower cost structures to compete head-on with the established airlines. There were several bankruptcies followed by a wave of consolidation with the fittest carriers surviving and the rest being\n\nThis growth in combination with the growth from the acquisition of AirTran has put a strain on the airlines employees. This strain has had an effect on service “Southwest was last in on-time performance among major airlines and last among big airlines in baggage handling” (McCartney, 2014, p. 16). “Employees resist change for a variety of reason,” (Parnell, 2014, p.294). It has also had a negative impact on labor union contract negotiations (McCartney, 2014). “Southwest is 85% unionized,” (Parnell, 2014, p.389).\n\nSouthwest Airline was from an idea on a napkin between Rollin King and Herb Kelleher. Eventually, after a few regulation issues, the airline became official on focusing point-to-point travel between Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. One of the early key success factors which stated in the case, “ In contrast to larger airlines servicing the cities through connecting interstate routes, Southwest would fly directly to each of the cities, and the flights would take roughly one hour each.” Not only Southwest has the advantage of time but also the trust on safety from frequent flyers by having a direct flight to each city. Likewise, within two years (1971-1973) due to price segmentation based on the time of before and after 7 PM along with weekends, the company became profitable.\n\nIn order to make up for increasing expenses Southwest needs to expand. My recommended strategy for Southwest to pursue, is to merge with Air-Tran and expand into areas where Air-Tran has a heavy presence and Southwest has none. With Southwest having a weak presence in the southeastern U.S., a key area to expand would be Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, which is the busiest airport in the U.S. There is obviously a need for the low air-fare company at this site. Southwest’s unique approach of no extra charge for luggage and extra friendly service should help Southwest. The merger is estimated to cost Southwest $1.4 billion dollars; Air-Trans income for 2010 was around $128 million, and along with the 138 new\n\nThe years since regulation have been rocky for the airline industry. Airline after airline has declared bankruptcy and either ceased existence or emerged as a weaker airline. The surviving airlines have done so by merging and protecting their territory with tactics not even dreamed of in most industries. Robert Crandall said it best when he noted, \"This is a nasty, rotten business (Petzinger,1995).\" You would think that with the competition allowed by deregulation that a large number of new names would exist, but that does not seem to be the case. Most Americans still travel on American, Delta, United, US Airways, or Continental (Kane, 2003). The only true champion of deregulation is Southwest Airlines, whose success is paving the way for others such as JetBlue, but the obstacles are enormous. Initially, the airlines went after each other by slashing fares and driving competitors out of business. The industry quickly learned that although this tactic was effective, it was not profitable, and it was more economical to focus on controlling the air out of a few cities (hubs) than to attempt to directly compete in every single market. Since most of the major airlines already had key cities in which they controlled most of the takeoff and landing slots, airlines could charge higher fares and take in greater profits without any real head to head\n\nAmerican Airlines has become the nation’s dominant air carrier after merging with US Airways and many have declared that the 787 is a critical next step in the modernization of American Airlines as a company. A while back American announced that flights will begin May 7 between Dallas-Fort Worth and its hub in Chicago, and beginning June 2 between Dallas-Fort Worth and Beijing. On June 4, American will fly the Dreamliner between Dallas-Fort Worth and Buenos Aires, Argentina. American said it will add more 787 routes this year as the new aircraft arrive, but they gave very little clues on what the future holds. \"As we take delivery of the 787 and all of our new aircraft on order, we will continue to assess our network to determine which"
