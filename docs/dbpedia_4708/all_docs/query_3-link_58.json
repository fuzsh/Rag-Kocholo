He has written for several leading publications, including Forbes Advisor, LendingTree, CNBC and ValuePenguin.

Each article is edited, fact-checked and reviewed by industry professionals to ensure quality and accuracy.\n\nEditorial Policy and Standards\n\nAdvertising & Editorial Disclosure\n\nWith the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards program, you can maximize your spending. As a budget carrier not affiliated with any alliance, Southwest offers specific ways to earn and redeem points.\n\nEarn points by flying with Southwest, using their co-branded credit cards, or through select travel and dining partners. Redeem these points primarily for Southwest flight tickets, which usually provide the best value.\n\nIf you have a Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card, you can also use points for gift cards, merchandise, experiences and events. Additionally, the program offers three membership tiers, with A-List and A-List Preferred members enjoying bonus points on flights and other perks.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nGet 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents per Rapid Rewards point when you redeem them for flight tickets.\n\nCo-branded Rapid Rewards credit card members have several other ways to redeem their points.\n\nIt’s possible to transfer points from some popular hotel loyalty programs to Southwest’s rewards program.\n\nHow Much Are Southwest Points Worth?\n\nHow much Southwest points are worth depends on your selected redemption method. When redeemed for flights, the value of Southwest points typically varies from 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents. The points you earn depends on the actual cost of a ticket and not the distance your flight covers. If you use them to book flight tickets, their value also depends on the route you wish to fly and the fare type.\n\nHOW TO COMPUTE SOUTHWEST POINTS VALUE\n\nYou may find out how much value you stand to receive by dividing the points you need for a free flight by the actual cost of the ticket. For instance, if a ticket that costs $230 requires 15,000 points for redemption, you get a value of around 1.53 cents per point (230/15000= $0.0153).\n\nTicket Cost / Equivalent Points = Points Value\n\nHow Southwest Points Compare to Other Airlines\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards program offers fairly average value compared to frequent flyer programs other popular airlines offer.\n\nSouthwest vs. Other Frequent Flyer Programs\n\nAirlines\n\nValuation\n\nHow to Earn Points From Southwest Airlines\n\nYou earn Rapid Rewards points on qualifying Southwest Airlines flights paid entirely with cash and on cash purchases of Southwest LUV Vouchers, travel funds and gift cards. You may also earn points when you spend with any of the program's partner merchants.\n\nSign-Up for Southwest Rapid Rewards\n\nEarning Points Using Southwest Airlines Co-Branded Credit Cards\n\nTo earn Southwest points, you have several options, including co-branded credit cards and a transfer partner. Southwest offers multiple credit cards tailored for personal and business use. These cards come with varying annual fees and rewards structures, including points on Southwest purchases, hotel and rental car partners, and other categories like local transit, internet and cable services. Here's a quick summary of each card\n\nFor those new to Southwest's rewards program, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus Credit Card offers a manageable annual fee of $69 and a generous introductory offer, making it a solid entry point.\n\nIf you're looking for more points on your Southwest purchases, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card steps up the game with 3X points and an annual fee of $99.\n\nFrequent Southwest flyers might prefer the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card, which offers the same earning rate as the Premier card but includes additional perks for a $149 annual fee.\n\nBusiness owners who travel often can benefit from the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Business Credit Card, with tailored rewards for business-related expenses.\n\nFor the ultimate Southwest business traveler, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Credit Card maximizes points earned on Southwest purchases, perfect for those who are frequently in the air for business.\n\nIn Addition, the Chase Ultimate Rewards Program allows for direct point transfers to Southwest at a 1-to-1 ratio, providing a straightforward way to convert credit card rewards into Southwest points.\n\nCredit CardMoneyGeek RatingSummaryRewards SummaryAnnual RewardsIntro OfferAnnual FeeBest starter card for the Southwest Airlines flyerEarn 1X – 2X points 3,000 anniversary points each yearEarn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.$69A great miles rewards card with no foreign transaction fee for frequent Southwest customersEarn 1X – 3X points6,000 anniversary points each yearEarn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.$99A great card for Southwest frequent flyersEarn 1X – 3X pointsN/AEarn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.$149A great miles credit card for international purchases with multiple miles-earning and redeeming opportunitiesEarn 1X – 3X pointsN/AEarn up to 120,000 points.

Earn 80,000 points after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening and an additional 40,000 points when you spend $15,000 in 9 months.$199\n\nEarn Miles Through Southwest Partners and Affiliates\n\nThe Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards program allows members to earn points by spending with its partner merchants from across categories.\n\nRapid Rewards Dining. Members earn 3X points per dollar if they opt-in for email communication. Otherwise, they can earn 1X point per $2 spent. Earning bonus points is also possible in other ways.\n\nRapid Rewards Shopping. Earn points when you use the Rapid Rewards Shopping platform to make purchases through more than 800 stores, such as Staples, Sephora and Macy's.\n\nOther Shopping Partners. Earn Rapid Rewards points when you shop with partner merchants such as 1-800-Flowers.com, Laithwaites, Harry & David and Home Chef.\n\nSouthwest Hotel Partners. Rapid Rewards points can be earned by booking eligible stays through partner hotels such as Marriott, Hyatt, MGM, Best Western and Choice Hotels. You may also earn points when you book through Southwest Hotels and Rocketmiles. You can also convert hotel rewards points to Southwest points.\n\nSouthwest Vacations. Earn points when booking vacations via Southwest Vacations.\n\nCar Rentals. Earn 600 points per qualifying car rental through Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National, Payless and Thrifty at participating locations.\n\nOther. Rapid Rewards points can be earned through NRG Home, Reliant, Rewards for Opinions, e-Rewards and Emergency Assistance Plus (EA+).\n\nBuying Points From Southwest Airlines\n\nIf you find yourself just a few points shy of booking that dream trip, buying Southwest points can be an option. You can purchase points directly through the Southwest Airlines website by logging into your Rapid Rewards account. The cost starts at $60 for 2,000 points, equating to 3 cents per point. As you buy more, the price per point may decrease slightly.\n\nHowever, buying Southwest points is generally not cost-effective. The value of a Rapid Rewards point when redeemed for flights is about 1.4 cents, so you’re paying more than double their worth if you buy them outright.\n\nThere are specific scenarios where buying Southwest points might make sense. For instance, if you're just a few points short of the amount needed to book an award flight, purchasing the extra points can help you secure your desired travel dates without waiting to accumulate more points through other means.\n\nAdditionally, Southwest occasionally offers limited-time promotions where you can earn bonus points for purchasing a certain amount. Buying points at regular prices is not always a great deal, but grabbing them during a sale can be a smart move.\n\nTransfer Points to Southwest Rapid Rewards\n\nTransferring points from various rewards programs to the Southwest Rapid Rewards program is possible. The transfer rate varies from one partner to the next.\n\nWorld of Hyatt: Get 2,400 Rapid Rewards points for 5,000 World of Hyatt points or 24,000 Rapid Rewards points for 50,000 World of Hyatt points.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy: Get 3,000 Rapid Rewards points for 9,000 Marriott Bonvoy points or 10,000 Rapid Rewards points for 30,000 Marriott Bonvoy points.\n\nBest Western Rewards: Get 1,200 Rapid Rewards points for 5,000 Best Western Rewards points.\n\nRadisson Rewards Americas: Get 200 Rapid Rewards points for 2,000 Radisson Rewards points or 5,000 Rapid Rewards points for 50,000 Radisson Rewards points.\n\nChoice Privileges: Get 1,800 Rapid Rewards points for 6,000 Choice Privileges points.\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards: Get 1,000 Rapid Rewards points for 1,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points.\n\nDiners Club: Get 1,200 Rapid Rewards Points for 1,500 Diners Club Rewards points.\n\nGiven the poor transfer ratios in most cases, transferring points from other rewards programs to the Rapid Rewards program might not be in your best interest unless you see no use for them in the programs to which they belong. For example, you might be better off booking a Southwest flight through the Chase Ultimate Rewards platform instead of transferring your Ultimate Rewards points to the Rapid Rewards program and then using them for a Southwest flight.\n\nWANT MORE FROM YOUR TRAVELS?\n\nIf you're looking for rewards beyond Southwest, check out our list of the Best Airline Credit Cards. We also ranked the Best Travel Credit Cards to help you find cards that offer rewards on travel-related perks and rewards.\n\nHow to Redeem Rapid Rewards\n\nIf you're wondering how to use Rapid Rewards points, know that you can easily redeem them for flight tickets. However, since Southwest Airlines is not a part of any alliance and does not have any airline partners, you are limited to using your points for flying with Southwest. Co-branded Rapid Rewards credit cardholders may redeem them for other rewards too.\n\nLog in to your Rapid Rewards account to book airline tickets. Then, look for flights based on your travel dates and fares. View how much different alternatives cost in points and make a selection. Remember that you'll need to pay fees and taxes in cash.\n\nIf you have a co-branded Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card, you may redeem your points through the More Rewards platform for international flights with global airlines, rental cars, hotel stays, events and more.\n\nGift cards: Get gift cards from popular names like Apple, Best Buy, Lowe's and Target. When redeeming your points for gift cards, you may expect to get a value of 0.25 cents to 0.65 cents per point.\n\nMerchandise: Choose from an array of merchandise through various categories. In this case, you may expect a value of 0.2 cents to 0.7 cents per point.\n\nExperiences: Purchase experiences, such as cruises, biking, rafting, spa packages and jeep tours. These offer below-average value, too.\n\nWhen Best to Redeem Southwest Points\n\nSouthwest does not have a fixed redemption chart. The number of points you require to book a flight ticket depends on its actual cash price. As a result, booking a ticket when prices are low will require fewer points.\n\nUsing your points to purchase flight tickets during Southwest sales might work well because there’s a direct link between the number of points you need and actual ticket prices. In addition, Southwest Airlines doesn’t have any cancellation fees, so you can re-book your ticket if prices drop.\n\nEXPERT TIP\n\n\"Southwest Airlines is an excellent value for American travelers who mainly fly within the U.S. However, it’s just as important to spend your miles as you would spend your cash — strategically.\n\nAdditionally, don’t use your miles for low-value redemptions like magazine subscriptions or merchandise. Your miles are best saved for flights.\"\n\n— Brett Holzhauer, contributing expert for MoneyGeek\n\nHow to Get the Southwest Rapid Rewards A-List Status\n\nOnce you join the Rapid Rewards program, you start at base-level membership. You can increase your tier level — A-List, A-List Preferred or Companion Pass — by earning points with purchases and flights.\n\nGetting to the Southwest Rapid Rewards A-List status requires taking 25 qualifying one-way flights or earning 35,000 TQPs during a calendar year. You may achieve A-List Preferred status by taking 50 qualifying one-way flights or earning 70,000 TQPs during a calendar year. Both membership levels let you earn bonus points, and you get access to other benefits as well.\n\n1\n\nA-List\n\nYou earn 25% bonus points on all qualifying flights. Other benefits include priority boarding, priority and express lanes, same-day changes, same-day standby, and a dedicated phone line for customer support.\n\n2\n\nA-List Preferred\n\nThis tier offers all the benefits that you receive as an A-List member. In addition, you earn 100% bonus points instead of 25% and free access to in-flight Wi-Fi.\n\n3\n\nCompanion Pass\n\nQualifying for a Companion Pass allows you to earn up to double the value of your Rapid Rewards points. This is because once you receive a companion pass, you may get another person to travel with you for free (not including fees and taxes) when you redeem your points for a flight ticket.\n\nHOW WE DETERMINED THE VALUE OF SOUTHWEST POINTS\n\nMoneyGeek experts have accounted for how the worth of Southwest Rapid Rewards points changes depending on different redemption methods to arrive at their average value. They have also analyzed the market closely.\n\nFAQ: How Much Are Southwest Points Worth?\n\nLearn more about Southwest points to dollars value to determine which redemption method might work best for you through these commonly asked questions.\n\nCan I use my Rapid Rewards points for someone else?\n\nYou may use your Rapid Rewards points to book flights for others. However, you can’t make itinerary changes independently. If you're a Rapid Rewards Credit Card holder, you may use the More Rewards platform to get gift cards, buy merchandise and book events or experiences for others.\n\nCan I transfer my Rapid Rewards points to a different rewards program?\n\nNo, you cannot transfer Rapid Rewards points to other rewards programs.\n\nCan I convert my Southwest Rapid Rewards points to dollars?\n\nNo, you cannot convert Southwest points to cash.\n\nHow many Southwest points do I need to get free flights?\n\nHow many points you need for a free flight on Southwest depends on the route, the date you wish to fly and the desired fare type.\n\nIs it worth buying Rapid Reward points?\n\nSince you typically pay 2.75 cents to 3 cents per point when buying Rapid Rewards points, purchasing them may not be in your best interest. However, consider buying them during promotional offers if you need more points to book a flight ticket.\n\nCan I use my points to buy $49, $69 and other low-fare flights?\n\nYes, you may use your Rapid Rewards points to book $29, $49, $69 and other low-fare flights with Southwest Airlines. However, you cannot use them to book military and government fare flights.\n\nHow many Southwest points do you need to get a free ticket?\n\nThe number of Southwest points needed for a flight depends on the cash price of the ticket. Generally, you need around 3,500 points for a $49 fare, based on our valuation of 1.4 cents per point. Redeeming points for a Wanna Get Away fare is your best option for getting a free flight more quickly, as these are the most budget-friendly fares Southwest offers.\n\nFind Your Best\n\nBest Business Credit Cards\n\nExplore Topics\n\nBusiness vs. Corporate Credit Cards\n\nAbout Doug Milnes, CFA\n\nDoug Milnes is a CFA charter holder with over 10 years of experience in corporate finance and the Head of Credit Cards at MoneyGeek.
