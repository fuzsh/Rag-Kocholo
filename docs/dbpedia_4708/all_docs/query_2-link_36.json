The company operates an extensive network of flights, primarily within the United States, offering service to various destinations across the country.\n\nSouthwest's business model is centered around providing affordable air travel options to enable more people to fly. The airline has been successful in achieving this objective by emphasizing operational efficiency, streamlined processes, cost control, and a consistent customer experience. This approach has allowed Southwest to maintain its position as one of the most cost-effective airlines in the industry.\n\nSouthwest operates a fleet consisting primarily of Boeing 737 aircraft, which greatly simplifies maintenance, training, and operational procedures.

The airline strives to differentiate itself by offering perks such as no change fees, free checked bags, and a customer-friendly loyalty program. By focusing on customer satisfaction, Southwest aims to build loyalty and recurrent business from its passengers.\n\nIn addition to passenger travel, Southwest Airlines also operates a cargo division.
