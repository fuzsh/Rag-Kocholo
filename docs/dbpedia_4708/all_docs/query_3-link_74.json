        "text": "Southwest® Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card Overview\n\nSouthwest Airlines is a bit like the Hatch chile pepper–you either love it or it’s just not for you. If you fall into the “It’s my preferred pepper/airline” camp, then the Southwest® Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card has enough palate-pleasers to justify the $199 annual fee. Although this is a review of the cobranded card and not the airline, it’s important to know what makes Southwest different to understand what makes the card’s perks worthwhile.\n\nSouthwest Airlines was founded on the premise of providing excellent service in a low-cost flying model. The company adopted still-unique measures which include offering up to two free checked bags per person, no preassigned seating and no difference in seat size throughout its planes. So if you prefer to travel in business or first-class, you likely aren’t looking to fly Southwest. But if that doesn’t matter to you or you have to fly the airline to get where you need to go, the Performance Card offers as close as you can get to an upscale flying experience with the airline. It offers four free upgraded boarding experiences per year, which means you’ll get first pick of the seats on your flight, enough Wi-Fi credits to cover you every day of the year and your choice of a Global Entry, TSA PreCheck, or NEXUS application fee credit every four years to expedite your airport security experience.\n\nThe card also offers elevated rewards on spending with the airlines and its Rapid Rewards partners, a passel of anniversary points each year and the chance to earn Tier Qualifying Points (TQPs) through card spending towards the airline’s A-list status, which pretty much means you’ll get priority boarding on all flights and some other ancillary perks like same-day flight changes.\n\nWho is the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card good for?\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card is good for anyone who plans to fly the airline regularly and can make use of the card’s most valuable perks, like the upgraded boarding passes, the Wi-Fi credits, the trusted traveler application fee credits and the anniversary points.\n\nWho shouldn’t get the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card?\n\nIf you only occasionally fly the airline or don’t think you can max out the perks, you should either consider the lower-cost Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card or another, more general purpose travel card.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card: How to earn rewards\n\nThe Southwest Rapids Rewards Performance Business Card earns at the following rates:\n\n4X points on Southwest® purchases\n\n3X points on Rapid Rewards® hotel and car rental partners\n\n2X points on social media and search engine advertising, internet, cable, and phone services , including rideshare services\n\n1X points on all other purchases\n\nIt also comes with a welcome bonus of up to 120,000 points. Earn 80,000 points after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening and an additional 40,000 points when you spend $15,000 in 9 months..\n\nYou can also earn up to 100,000 additional bonus points for referring friends to any Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card. You’ll get 20,000 bonus points for each referral.\n\nThere’s additional opportunity to earn Rapid Rewards points through spending with select partners, including Rapid Rewards Shopping, 1-800-FLOWERS and other partners. You can find the full list here.\n\nHow to redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card rewards\n\nThe best use of Rapid Rewards points is to redeem for flights, where a point is generally worth a fixed value tied to the cash price of the ticket. In most cases you should expect to get a value of about 1.4 cents per point, although your exact redemption value will vary, depending on which fare class you’re redeeming for and the cash price of your ticket. Southwest has four fare classes, starting with the bare bones Wanna Get Away fare to the fancier-sounding Business Select.\n\nHowever, all seats are the same size on Southwest, and everyone gets up to two checked pieces of baggage for free, so the pricier fares merely cover the cost to have upgraded boarding privileges which means picking your seats earlier and other ancillary perks like higher rewards on paid tickets and refundable fares vs non-refundable. Those last two benefits won’t matter on a ticket booked with points.\n\nOther, less-valuable, redemption options include gift cards, merchandise, hotel stays, rental cars and cardmember experiences through the Southwest More Rewards program, which includes VIP access to concerts and similar hard-to-get events that many credit card issuers use to spice up their redemption catalogs.\n\nChase’s Pay Yourself Back program also extends to the Southwest Credit cards. So you can use your points to take as a statement credit at a value of 1 cent per point towards the Rapid Rewards Performance Card’s annual fee, or at a value of 0.8 cents per point towards an eligible purchase within 90 days of when the annual fee or charge is posted. The eligible purchase categories change every few months but from April 1 through June 30, 2024 the category is office supply stores.\n\nAdditional benefits\n\nBefore we get into the card-specific benefits, we need a sidebar about the best potential perk of holding any Southwest credit card—the ability to earn points towards the airline’s Companion Pass perk. This is one of the most generous benefits offered by any airline and allows you to book a companion ticket on any flight you take free of airline charges, although you must pay taxes and fees for that ticket. For anyone who routinely flies with a colleague several times a year on the airline, for business, this could save you a bundle.\n\nTo earn a Companion Pass requires flying 100 qualifying one-way flights or earning 135,000 qualifying points in a calendar year. Once earned, the pass is good for the following full calendar year, plus the remainder of the year in which you earned it. This means someone who owns the Rapid Rewards Performance Business card, meets the minimum spending requirement to earn the welcome bonus and uses the card with regularity for their business spending has a high probability of earning enough qualifying points to earn the pass. That can be worth more than the card’s carrying cost and card perks combined.\n\nOther card perks specific to the Rapid Rewards Performance card include:\n\nNo charge for additional employee cards. Not having to pay an extra fee to provide cards for staff members is a nice perk.\n\n9,000 anniversary points each year. If the average value of a Southwest point is around 1.4 cents each, this yearly bonus is worth about $126 towards your next award flight. Plus, these points count as qualifying points towards a Companion Pass, giving you a nice boost in the years that follow earning the initial welcome bonus.\n\n4 upgraded boardings per year (if avialable) . Southwest’s unique policy of first-come, first-likely-to-avoid-a-middle-seat means that those in boarding positions A1 through A15 get first dibs on the seat of their choice. Ownership of the card comes with reimbursement of four upgraded boardings per year, which must be purchased within 24 hours of the flight.\n\nUp to 365 inflight Wi-Fi credits per year. Wi-Fi costs $8 per device on Southwest flights so for business owners or employees who want to use the in-air time to work, this is a terrific benefit. Since it’s highly unlikely you’ll fly every single day of the year, you can use the credits to connect both a laptop and phone on the same flight.\n\nUp to $500 transfer fee credit. Should you choose to transfer your Rapid Rewards points to someone else’s account, charge it to your card and be reimbursed up to $500 in transfer fees. Southwest charges $5 for every $500 points transferred with a minimum of 2,000 points needed to transfer.\n\nGlobal Entry, TSA PreCheck or NEXUS application fee statement credit: Get reimbursed up to $100 every four years for the cost of the application fee for one of these trusted traveler programs when you charge it to the card.\n\nEarn Tier Qualifying Points (TQPs) for spending: For every $5,000 spent on the card, earn 1,500 TQPs towards Southwest A-list elite status. A-list status grants priority boarding, a 25% earning bonus and same-day flight changes and requires either 20 one-way flights or 35,000 TQPs in a calendar year to achieve.\n\nTravel and purchase protections: The card includes lost luggage reimbursement, baggage delay coverage for bags delayed over six hours, extended warranty coverage and purchase protection.\n\nCredit cards similar to Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Card brings the heat when it comes to benefits with the airline. But it’s worth comparing to other like-minded options to make sure you pick the best card for your needs.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card vs. Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card\n\nThe $99-annual-fee Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card card is a watered-down version of the Performance Card with a price to match. For $100 less per year, the card has a slightly lower rewards structure of 3 points per $1 spent on Southwest Airlines® purchases, 2 points per $1 spent on Rapid Rewards hotel and car rental partner purchases and 1 point per $1 spent on everyday purchases.\n\nIt also offers a lower annual points bonus of 6,000 to the Performance card’s 9,000 and instead of four upgraded boardings and 365 Wi-Fi credits, offers two “Early-Bird” check-ins, which means you’ll get checked in before the general public and have a better shot at an early boarding position. All other benefits, from TQP-earning potential to travel and purchase protections are the same. Anyone who flies Southwest with any regularity will likely find it worth the extra $100 to choose the Performance Business Card over the Premier for the extra value, four-times-a-year guaranteed early boarding and Wi-Fi credits.\n\nInk Business Preferred® Credit Card vs. Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card\n\nIf you fly semi-regularly for work, you may occasionally have to fly an airline other than Southwest. Or perhaps you want a business travel card that will help you earn rewards on a wide variety of travel options. The Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card fills that niche. For an annual fee of $95, the card earns Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, which can be used to book travel through Chase Travel℠ or transferred to travel loyalty partners and both options include Southwest Airlines.\n\nYou can take your points as cash back at a penny a piece or you can use points earned on this card to book travel through Chase at a 25% increase, making them worth 1.25 cents each. The card doesn’t offer any protection for your baggage, but it does offer trip cancellation and interruption insurance, primary auto rental coverage and cellphone insurance. The main consideration in choosing between this card and the Southwest Performance card is if you want flexibility with your rewards, or Southwest-specific perks.\n\nIs the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card right for you?\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card is right for someone who regularly flies the airline for work and wants to access the airline-specific card perks. If you fly roundtrip twice a year or less on the airline, you’ll get more value from another option.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nHow hard is it to get a Southwest Business card?\n\nLike most small business credit cards, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business card will require a hard credit check of your personal credit in order to be approved. And, like most rewards cards, you’ll likely need to have good to excellent credit to be approved. Generally this means a score of 670 or above on the FICO scoring range.\n\nHow many business cards does Southwest offer?\n\nSouthwest currently offers two cobranded credit cards in partnership with Chase: The Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business Card and the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Business Card.\n\nDoes a Southwest business card earn a Companion Pass?\n\nNeither of Southwest’s two business cards automatically grant a Companion Pass with ownership, but they can help expedite earning one through earning the welcome bonus and/or spending on the card."
