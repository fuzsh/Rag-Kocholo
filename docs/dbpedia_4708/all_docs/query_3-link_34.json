        "text": "Every major airline uses loyalty programs to provide customers with opportunities to earn rewards and benefits as they travel. As you earn points and miles, you can redeem them for award flights to places all over the world. To help boost their rewards, many people apply for one of the best travel credit cards or one of the best airline credit cards to earn more points and miles on their purchases.\n\nIf you compare credit cards, you’ll find that Southwest Airlines offers many fantastic options. Its credit cards provide points in the form of Southwest Rapid Rewards, which you can redeem for Southwest flights.\n\nIn this guide to the Southwest Rapid Rewards program, you’ll learn about the structure of the program, how to earn and use Rapid Rewards points, and the best Southwest credit cards for earning the most points.\n\nAbout Southwest Airlines\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co. began in 1967 as Air Southwest Co. Its goal was to provide airline service between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio in Texas. By 1971, the company had achieved its goal of flying between these three cities, changed its name to Southwest Airlines, and had nearly 200 employees.\n\nJust a few decades later in the 1980s, Southwest had expanded its services to cities like Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, El Paso, Tulsa, New Orleans, and more. During this period, Southwest employed more than 3,000 individuals and flew over 175,000 trips.\n\nToday, Southwest flies to most states within the U.S., as well as additional countries like Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Caribbean. The Texas-based company has over 60,000 employees and is known for its low fares, friendly flight attendants, and allowing passengers two free checked bags on every Southwest flight. Southwest’s open seating policy is also a big hit for friends and families wanting to sit together on the plane and one of the many reasons people feel Southwest is the best airline to fly.\n\nRapid Rewards program\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards program is Southwest’s frequent flyer program for its customers. Members of the program can earn Rapid Rewards points as they book and fly Southwest itineraries. You can also earn bonus points by using Southwest credit cards to make purchases.\n\nSouthwest doesn’t provide an award chart to show you how many points are needed for specific fares. Instead, the number of points you need for a flight depends on how much the fare costs. As prices for Southwest flights fluctuate, the points needed for the same flights will also fluctuate. However, you can always check the Southwest website to see how many points you would need on any available flight.\n\nFrequent Southwest flyers can attain status levels within the Rapid Rewards program and unlock exclusive perks. Here’s a look at how these status levels work:\n\nRequirements Benefits A-List Fly 20 one-way qualifying flights or earn 35,000 tier qualifying points in a calendar year Priority boarding, 25% earning bonus, same-day standby, priority check-in and security lane access, and a dedicated A-List member phone line A-List Preferred Fly 40 one-way qualifying flights or earn 70,000 tier qualifying points in a calendar year Priority boarding, 100% earning bonus, same-day standby, priority check-in and security lane access, dedicated A-List Preferred member phone line, and free in-flight Wi-Fi Companion Pass Fly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 135,000 qualifying points in a calendar year Choose one person to fly with you for free (minus taxes and fees) every time you purchase or redeem points for a flight\n\nA-List and A-List Preferred statuses both provide benefits that can help boost your Southwest flying experience. To qualify for these statuses, you’ll need to fly many Southwest flights, earn points with an eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card, or do a combination of the two to earn tier qualifying points.\n\nTier qualifying points can only be earned on Southwest flights you pay for (not award travel) or by making purchases with an eligible Southwest credit card. So if you fly often and use your credit card on expenses, you can qualify for A-List or A-List Preferred a lot quicker.\n\nPerhaps the most rewarding status from Southwest, though, is the Southwest Companion Pass. Companion passes are common enough benefits on major airlines, but the Southwest Companion Pass is easily the most valuable of them all. This benefit lets you choose any companion to fly for (basically) free along with you. For couples, families, and friends that like to travel together, it’s an amazing way to save money on flights.\n\nEarning the Companion Pass is a little different from earning A-List or A-List Preferred status. Although those statuses require tier qualifying points, the Companion Pass requires the simplified qualifying points. These points can be earned on paid Southwest flights, by using Southwest credit cards, and by making purchases with Rapid Rewards partners.\n\nAs an example, if you qualify for a Southwest credit card and receive its welcome offer, the points from the welcome offer would count toward earning the Companion Pass. They would not, however, count toward earning A-List or A-List Preferred status. Also, every point you earn from Southwest credit card purchases would count toward the Companion Pass, without any limits. For A-List and A-List Preferred, there’s a cap of 15,000 tier qualifying points you can earn per year by making purchases with your Southwest credit card.\n\nHow much Rapid Rewards points are worth\n\nRapid Rewards points don’t operate with any sort of fixed value. As the price of Southwest fares changes, the number of Rapid Rewards points you need for an award flight also change. This is called dynamic pricing.\n\nEven though Southwest uses dynamic pricing, its prices are typically low enough that you can often find great redemption options. Southwest Rapid Rewards points are generally worth about 1.5 cents per point. So if you have 20,000 Rapid Rewards points, that should be enough to get you a Southwest fare worth about $300.\n\nOf course, because of dynamic pricing, this value of your credit card points won’t always be exact. Expect to sometimes see different valuations that can be either higher or lower than 1.5 cents per point.\n\nHere are a few examples of Southwest award redemptions and their values:\n\nIn this example, we have a round-trip flight between Los Angeles and Denver for 5,304 points, plus $11.20 in taxes and fees.\n\nThe dollar value of this flight is $89.96, including the taxes and fees. To find the value of your points for this itinerary, divide the dollar amount by the number of points required. So $89.96 divided by 5,304 points equals about 1.7 cents per point.\n\nSwitching to the East Coast, we have a roundtrip flight between Orlando and New York City for 14,742 points, plus $11.20 in taxes and fees.\n\nAfter you do the math ($218.96 / 14,742), you get a value of about 1.5 cents per point for this itinerary.\n\nOverall, both of these values are great and they fall right around the average of what you can expect from Southwest. As you can see, the values might change by a small amount, but that amount could easily be in your favor — and it always pays to work out the math when shopping for your redemptions.\n\nHow to fly Southwest with points\n\nTo actually find fares and use your Rapid Rewards points to book a flight, you’ll need to visit Southwest.com or open the Southwest app on a compatible device. The process is a bit easier on the website, though.\n\nHere are a few steps to take if you want to book a flight and start flying Southwest with points:\n\nHead to the Southwest website and log into your Rapid Rewards account.\n\nOn the main page, you’ll see the area where you can book flights. Choose between round trip or one-way, set your departure and arrival cities, as well as your dates and passengers. You’ll want to click on the “Points” option to make sure the fares are shown with points values. Click “Search” when you’re ready.\n\nNote: The “Low Fare Calendar” option on this page is a great way to see a whole month’s worth of flights on one screen.\n\nNow, you’ll get options for the different available flights. The number of points you need is prominently displayed so you know what you’re paying. Choose between the different types of fares and click “Continue” to get to the next screen.\n\nHere, you’ll get the full breakdown of your itinerary, including the total number of points needed and any applicable taxes and fees. From this point, you continue on to purchase the flight.\n\nRedeeming your points for flights with Southwest is easy and straightforward. For the most part, you can book most Southwest fares using points. Only special fares — including infant, child, military, and government fares — can’t be booked with points. You also can’t book other travel redemption options, like Southwest Vacation packages or travel purchased through a travel agent.\n\nThere are no blackout dates for flights booked with Southwest Rapid Rewards points, which is an extremely valuable benefit. Many airlines institute blackout dates that don’t allow you to book award flights during popular times of the year, but you don’t have to worry about that with Southwest.\n\nIf you don’t want to use your points on flights, cardholders can also redeem them for merchandise, hotel stays, rentals cars, gift cards, and more.\n\nSouthwest Airlines partners\n\nMany airlines work with other companies to provide ways for their customers to continue earning more rewards when they use the services of the airline’s partners. Currently, Southwest partners with a variety of companies. This includes credit card issuers, hotels, rental car agencies, and more.\n\nCredit card partners\n\nSouthwest has partnered with credit card companies to offer opportunities to earn Rapid Rewards points as you pay for purchases with your eligible card.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these credit card companies:\n\nChase\n\nDiners Club\n\nHotel partners\n\nFlights and hotel stays are common pairings for most travelers. With Southwest hotel partners, you can earn Rapid Rewards points on every hotel stay. Simply input your Rapid Rewards account number when booking a stay with eligible hotels.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these hotel programs:\n\nBest Western Rewards\n\nChoice Privileges\n\nMarriott Bonvoy\n\nMGM Resorts International\n\nRadisson Rewards\n\nRocketmiles\n\nWorld of Hyatt\n\nRental car partners\n\nMany travelers need a rental car on their trips, which is why Southwest partners with rental car agencies. Booking a rental car through these agencies will net you some valuable Rapid Rewards points.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these rental car companies:\n\nAlamo\n\nAvis\n\nBudget\n\nDollar\n\nHertz\n\nNational\n\nPayless\n\nThrifty\n\nShopping and dining partners\n\nFor your shopping and dining needs, Southwest has you covered. Southwest partners with specific shopping and dining companies so you can continue earning rewards on your purchases.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these shopping and dining companies:\n\n1-800-Flowers.com\n\nHarry & David\n\nHome Chef\n\nLaithwaites\n\nHome and lifestyle partners\n\nSouthwest partners with home and lifestyle companies so you can earn points on common expenses such as gas and utility bills.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these home and lifestyle companies:\n\nNRG Home\n\nMarathon gas stations\n\nReliant\n\nOther partners\n\nFor other ways to earn Rapid Rewards points, consider looking into other companies that Southwest partners with. This includes some of the best survey sites and more.\n\nSouthwest has partnerships with these other companies:\n\nEmergency Assistance Plus\n\nE-Rewards Opinion Panel\n\nRewards for Opinions\n\nHow to earn Rapid Rewards points\n\nSouthwest provides Rapid Rewards members with a wide range of options to continue earning points on an everyday basis. Flying may be one of the most obvious ways to earn points, but you’d be surprised at the other opportunities available.\n\nTake flights\n\nThe most obvious choice is often one of the best ones as well. You can earn a lot of points simply by booking and taking Southwest flights. Even better, you’ll be on your way to earning A-List, A-List Preferred, and/or a Southwest Companion Pass as you take more flights.\n\nStay at hotels\n\nSouthwest doesn’t operate any hotels, but that doesn’t mean you can’t earn Rapid Rewards points from hotel stays. If you book through the Southwest Hotels website or input your Rapid Rewards account number on a stay with an eligible hotel (listed above), you’ll earn Rapid Rewards points.\n\nEat at restaurants\n\nHas Southwest entered the restaurant industry? Not quite, but with Rapid Rewards Dining, you can watch your Rapid Rewards points total grow while enjoying a nice meal in your local area.\n\nUse the Rapid Rewards Dining website to search for restaurants wherever you’re located. Find out which restaurants participate in this program, go eat at a participating restaurant, and then pay with your linked card. You’ll earn Rapid Rewards points for every dollar you spend.\n\nUse credit cards\n\nIf you have a Southwest credit card, it’s easy to start earning loads of Rapid Rewards points. Credit cards can offer big welcome offers for new cardmembers that can set you up with enough points to fly for free. Additionally, you’ll earn points on every purchase you make, so there’s no limit on how many points you can accumulate.\n\nSouthwest cards also typically offer increased earning rates on Southwest flights as well as hotel and car rental partner purchases. If you use a Southwest card while traveling with Southwest and Southwest partners, your points will start adding up quickly.\n\nPurchase points\n\nPurchasing points from an airline isn’t typically the most efficient strategy for earning rewards because you don’t often get the most bang for your buck this way. But there are times when buying points makes sense. If you only need a small number of points and you need them quickly, this strategy could be worth it for you. Also, if you keep an eye out for any points purchasing deals from Southwest, you’ll get a better deal.\n\nShop online\n\nMost major airlines have their own online shopping portal, including Southwest.

Also, receive 3,000 Rapid Rewards anniversary points each year.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card: Earn a generous 50,000-point welcome offer after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months and receive 6,000 Rapid Rewards anniversary points each year.

This card also has no foreign transaction fees and can earn tier qualifying points toward A-List status.

Certain Chase cards, like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card and Chase Sapphire Reserve®, can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to the Rapid Rewards program. This makes it easy to get Southwest Rapid Rewards points when you need them.\n\nAdditionally, Diners Club points can also be transferred to the Rapid Rewards program. However, Chase points transfer at a 1:1 ratio, and Diners Club points transfer at 1,500 Diners Club points for every 1,200 Rapid Rewards points, so they are not quite as lucrative.\n\nFAQs\n\nBottom line\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points can help you travel throughout the U.S. and to multiple other countries.
