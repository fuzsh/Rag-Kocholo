Southwest Airlines today comes to the rescue with a tool that assists company travel",

        "text": "\"We see SWABIZ as one of the next logical steps in the continued evolution of our online presence,\" said Brad Newcomb, a regional marketing director for Southwest Airlines.\n\nSouthwest Airlines recently reported that more than 25 percent of its passenger revenues are booked through southwest.com. With its weekly Click 'N Save fares (available only through southwest.com) and double credit in its frequent flyer program, Rapid Rewards, many business travelers have turned to the carrier's website for their travel needs. Before SWABIZ, however, company travel managers have been faced with the challenge of tracking online reservations made by their travelers.\n\n\"We have a 29-year history of listening to our Customers, and company travel managers need an easy way to track business travel booked online,\" Newcomb said. \"In true Southwest Airlines fashion of offering a value to our Customers, company travel managers can now stay in the loop while allowing their travelers to book reservations in the method they prefer.\"\n\nIn addition to allowing company travel planners to track business travel booked through southwest.com, another benefit from SWABIZ goes right to the bottom line. Many company travel planners use a business booking tool which charges the airline and travel planner a fee for travel purchases. Southwest's SWABIZ does not charge a third-party fee of any kind for its services.\n\nNewcomb said today's unveiling of SWABIZ is just the first phase of what will be an \"evolving\" effort from the low-fare carrier. \"We will continue to enhance SWABIZ based on the feedback and utilization from our travel manager partners,\" Newcomb said. \"Based on what they tell us, we hope to add functionality so that SWABIZ continues to provide a valuable service.\"\n\nTrips booked through SWABIZ by authorized company travelers using the official Company ID (CID) will be posted to the company's travel report within 24 hours of purchase. The company travel planner will then have access to such information as the traveler's name, confirmation number, ticket number, type of transaction, and fare booked. The travel planner may also generate customized travel reports to gather such data as the company's total travel expenditure, monthly average, or city pairs flown.\n\nCompany travel planners may log on to southwest.com, then click on \"SWABIZ,\" for more information on how to register for the service. Companies will not be entitled to compensation - including commissions, rebates, or travel discounts - for use of SWABIZ.\n\nFor the fifth year in a row, FORTUNE magazine has recognized Southwest Airlines in its annual survey of corporate reputations. This year, FORTUNE listed Southwest Airlines among America’s Top Ten most admired corporations. In 1999, as in 1998, 1997 and 1996, Southwest also was named the most admired airline.\n\nEditor’s Notes:"
