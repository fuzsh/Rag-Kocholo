        "text": "Terms & Conditions\n\nOnly the Rapid Rewards® Member (Member Name, Rapid Rewards #xxxxxxxxxx) who received this email/offer from Southwest Airlines® is eligible for this promotion. No registration is required. Offer is not transferable. Offer is valid for domestic and international travel. To extend Member’s existing A-List or A-List Preferred tier benefits status through December 31, 2022, Member must fly two qualifying round trips (or four qualifying one-way) revenue or award flights between August 19, 2021 and November 19, 2021 (the “Promotion Period”). This offer applies to all flights taken during the Promotional Period, regardless of when they were booked.\n\nA qualifying round trip flight for this promotion is a round trip revenue or award flight on Southwest® from an origin city to a destination city and back to the originating airport or carrier-recognized co-terminal. A qualifying one-way flight for this promotion is a one-way revenue or award flight on Southwest from an origin city to a destination city, including any intermediate stops and/or connections on Southwest. Companion Pass®, charter flights, reward and group travel, and Southwest Vacations® packages do not qualify as one-way or round trip revenue or award flights for this promotion. Changes made to any itinerary after purchase of a one-way or round trip revenue or award flight may eliminate qualification for this promotion. A-List or A-List Preferred tier benefits status confirmation typically takes place within 4 weeks. Log in to your account at Southwest.com® to verify your tier status after requirements are met. During the Promotional Period you will not receive an A-List or A-List Preferred card, but you will continue to receive your existing tier status benefits on all flights booked after qualification is met when you provide your Rapid Rewards account number in your reservation.\n\nYour Rapid Rewards number must be included in your revenue and award flight reservation for your travel to count. Award travel will only be earned by the person whose name appears in the Rapid Rewards account and who actually travels, regardless of who purchased or paid for the ticket.\n\nThis promotion is not combinable with other promotion codes or special offers. All award travel is subject to taxes, fees, and other government on airport-imposed charges of at least $5.60 per one-way trip. Applicable taxes, fees, and other government or airport-imposed charges can vary significantly based on your arrival and departure destination. The payment of any taxes, fees, and other government or airport-imposed charges is the responsibility of the Passenger and must be paid at the time award travel is booked with a credit card, travel fund, or Southwest gift card.\n\nAll Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at www.southwest.com/rrterms. Southwest reserves the right to amend, suspend, or change the Rapid Rewards program and/or Rapid Rewards program rules at any time without notice. Rapid Rewards Members do not acquire property rights in accrued points. The number of Rapid Rewards points needed for a particular Southwest flight is set by Southwest and will vary depending on destination, time, day of travel, demand, fare type, point redemption rate, and other factors, and is subject to change at any time until the booking is confirmed.\n\nTerms for A-List benefits:\n\n^Boarding positions will be automatically reserved for you and the Passengers on your reservation 36 hours prior to the flight. You and Passengers on your reservation will still need to check in within 24 hours of scheduled departure to retrieve your boarding passes. Some restrictions apply. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, your reservation must be booked 36 hours prior to scheduled departure, and on Group Travel itineraries, priority boarding will only apply to A-List and A-List Preferred Members.\n\n*Qualifying flights include flights booked and flown through Southwest and flights paid entirely with dollars, Southwest LUV Vouchers, gift cards or travel funds, and with no portion of the purchase price paid for with Rapid Rewards points.\n\n**A-List and A-List Preferred Members will have same-day standby benefits free of airline charges, but will be required to pay any additional government taxes and fees associated with changes in their itinerary. On the day of travel, please see a Customer Service Agent at the airport for this benefit and for information regarding any additional government taxes and fees. This benefit is not available at Southwest® kiosks. This benefit will be provided for A-List and A-List Preferred Members traveling prior to the original scheduled departure, between the same airport pairs, on the original date of travel, where a seat is available. On flights that do not meet these qualifications, A-List and A-List Preferred Members will receive priority standby and will be required to pay the difference in fare and any additional government taxes and fees if a seat becomes available. A-List Preferred Members will be prioritized ahead of A-List Members. If an A-List or A-List Preferred Member is traveling on a multiple-Passenger reservation, same-day standby and priority standby will not be provided for non-A-List or non-A-List Preferred Members in the same reservation. For A-List and A-List Preferred Members who have also qualified for a Companion Pass®, A-List and A-List Preferred benefits are not available to the Companion unless the Companion is also an A-List or A-List Preferred Member.\n\n***For a complete list of available Fly By locations, visit Southwest.com/flyby.\n\nTerms for A-List Preferred Benefits:\n\n^Boarding positions will be automatically reserved for you and the Passengers on your reservation 36 hours prior to the flight.
