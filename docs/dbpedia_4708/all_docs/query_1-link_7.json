        "text": "DALLAS, May 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The votes have been tallied, and Southwest Airlines' (NYSE: LUV) Rapid Rewards program took home top honors as Program of the Year at InsideFlyer magazine's annual Freddie Awards ceremony recently in New York.\n\n\"We can't think of a better birthday present for Rapid Rewards as we celebrate the program's 15th year,\" said Debra Benton, Southwest's director of loyalty marketing. \"To be named Program of the Year by actual travelers proves Rapid Rewards lives up to its name.\"\n\nEach year, InsideFlyer magazine invites members of all frequent traveler programs to vote for the programs they feel deliver the best combination of benefits, awards, and returns on loyalty from the traveler's point of view. Winners are determined not only by how many votes a program receives but by the overall merits of each program as reflected in \"value voting,\" in which voters rate their favorite programs on a scale of one to ten.\n\n\"In a year that has seen many things changes, Rapid Rewards' combination of simplicity, generosity, and outstanding Customer Service continues to win loyalty,\" said Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer.\n\nSouthwest also was honored with awards for best Customer Service, best bonus promotion, and best award redemption. The airline placed second in the categories for best newsletter and best web site, and it received a third place ranking for best affinity credit card. The airline has won several Freddie Awards from InsideFlyer over the years and has been given high marks for many program elements. \"The fact that we've placed high in many categories for the past four years tells us we're consistently focusing on what matters to the Customer,\" Benton said. \"Rapid Rewards is a simple, yet lucrative program. The Freddie Awards reinforce that although we don't have airport lounges and other perks, we are giving our members what they want -- free tickets they can use.\"\n\nMore than 150,000 frequent flyers submitted ballots to Freddie Awards organizers, casting votes for programs worldwide. The wins for Southwest Airlines are all the more significant since it flies only within the United States and does not interline with other airlines.\n\nSouthwest's Rapid Rewards program lets frequent flyers stop counting miles and start taking trips. \"Our members continuously praise Rapid Rewards for its simplicity,\" said Benton. \"It's easy to earn trips, and it's even easier to redeem them. It's a program members can actually use, not just dream about.\"\n\nMembers earn credits by flying or doing business with the program's preferred partners. A roundtrip equals two credits (one-way ticket equals one). Members must fly eight roundtrips or earn 16 credits in a 12-month period to receive an award ticket. Once the award ticket is earned (by flying, buying, staying, driving, surfing the Internet, or talking on the phone), Southwest automatically sends it to the Customer -- free travel fast with no hassle. Plus, Southwest allows the member to transfer the award ticket to anyone with no additional paperwork.\n\nRapid Rewards also offers double credit (which won this year's best bonus promotion) when members book online at the airline's web site, www.southwest.com , and travel by Dec. 31, 2002. That means travelers can earn a free ticket in as few as four roundtrip flights purchased online. At the elite level, Southwest offers members who fly 50 roundtrips (or earn 100 credits) within 12 months a Companion Pass, which allows a member to designate a traveler to fly with them free of charge for 12 months. Again, with double credit for booking online, it would take only 25 roundtrips.\n\nSouthwest is the nation's fourth largest carrier in terms of Customers boarded. The airline currently operates nearly 2,800 daily flights to 59 airports in 58 cities in 30 states. Southwest employs more than 34,000 people nationwide.\n\nwww.southwest.com MAKE YOUR OPINION COUNT - Click Here http://tbutton.prnewswire.com/prn/11690X65333785"
