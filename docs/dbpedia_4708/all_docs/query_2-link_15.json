        "text": "To be eligible to receive promotional A-List status, Member must (a) be an elite status member on another domestic airline; (b) submit proof of his or her other current airline elite card or statement, name, and Rapid Rewards® account number and all of the foregoing must be verified by Southwest Airlines®. Qualification and promotional A-List status confirmation must be completed prior to booking of travel to receive A-List benefits. Promotional A-List status confirmation typically takes place within 12 business days of registration and verification process. Current A-List Members whose status is expiring are not eligible for the promotion. If Member qualifies for promotional A-List status, during the promotional period, Member will not receive an A-List card, but Member will receive all A-List status benefits on all flights booked after qualifying for this Southwest Status Match promotion, when Member provides their Rapid Rewards account number when making their reservation. This Southwest Status Match promotion is only available to Member if Member has not received promotional A-List status in any other promotion in the last 12 months.\n\nTo extend promotional A-List status for 12 months, after qualifying for this Southwest Status Match promotion, Member must book and complete three qualifying round trip flights (or six one-way qualifying flights) from Member's qualifying flights booked and flown between Member’s enrollment date for this promotion and the end of Member’s 90-day promotional period. Valid on new reservations booked within the promotional time period only. A qualifying one-way flight for this promotion is a one-way revenue flight on Southwest Airlines from an origin city to a destination city, including any intermediate stops and/or connections on Southwest Airlines. A qualifying round trip flight for this promotion is a revenue flight on Southwest Airlines from an origin city to a destination city and back to the originating airport or carrier-recognized co-terminal. Cash + Points bookings will not earn Rapid Rewards points, tier qualifying points for A-List or A-List Preferred status, or Companion Pass® qualifying points. Flights paid for with Cash + Points will count toward a Member's qualifying one-way flights for A-List, A-List Preferred, or Companion Pass status when flown. Purchased points will not qualify for this promotion. Tier qualifying points are earned through the purchase of revenue flights or through the use of the Rapid Rewards Premier and Priority Consumer Credit Cards and the Rapid Rewards Premier and Performance Business Credit Cards from Chase. Companion Pass, charter flights, Southwest Vacations® packages, and reward and group travel do not qualify as one-way or round trip revenue flights for extension of promotional A-List status. Changes made to an itinerary after purchase of a one-way or round trip revenue flight may eliminate qualification for extension of promotional A-List status. If A-List status is earned by flying 20 qualifying one-way flights or earning 35,000 tier qualifying points in the calendar year while qualified for promotional A-List status, the regular A-List status will supersede the promotional A-List status, entitling the Member to A-List status through December 31, 2024. Enrollment in the Southwest Status Match promotion must take place before December 31, 2024. Southwest reserves the right to suspend this promotion at any point without notice. This promotion to extend A-List promotional status for 12 months is available to Member if Member has not received promotional A-List status in any other promotion in the last 12 months or participated in any other status match promotion in the last 12 months. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at Southwest.com/rrterms.\n\n1Boarding positions will be automatically reserved for you and the Passengers on your reservation 36 hours prior to the flight. You and Passengers on your reservation will still need to check in within 24 hours of scheduled departure to retrieve your boarding passes. Some restrictions apply. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, your reservation must be booked 36 hours prior to scheduled departure, and on Group Travel itineraries, priority boarding will only apply to A-List and A-List Preferred Members.\n\n2Priority Lane and Express Lane are designed to speed our Business Select and Anytime Customers, as well as A-List, and A-List Preferred Members, through check-in and security lines. Priority Lane is at the Southwest check-in counter, and Express Lane is at the security checkpoint. To find where this is available, visit the Airport Information Page and check the amenities section in the dropdown for the respective airport."
