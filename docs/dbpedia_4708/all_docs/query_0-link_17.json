        "text": "Important information\n\nLearn more about A-List Program Rules\n\n1Points can be earned from (a) qualifying flights booked and flown through Southwest® or (b) through qualifying purchases with our Rapid Rewards® partners. Qualifying flights include flights paid entirely with dollars, Southwest LUV Vouchers®, gift cards or flight credits, and with no portion of the purchase price paid for with Rapid Rewards points. Members with an open Southwest Rapid Rewards™ Credit Card on the first business day of each calendar year will earn one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass® qualifying points each calendar year. Cash + Points bookings will not earn Rapid Rewards points, tier qualifying points for A-List or A-List Preferred status or Companion Pass qualifying points.\n\nTier Qualifying Points For Consumer Cards: Tier qualifying points (TQPs) are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest Airlines® or when you, or an authorized user, use the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. (You'll earn 1,500 for each $5,000 in purchases annually. \"Annually\" means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and each 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date.) TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account. The following will not count toward qualification for A-List or A-List Preferred status: Rapid Rewards program enrollment points; Rapid Rewards reward flights; Rapid Rewards Companion Pass® travel; Rapid Rewards partner points except for TQPs earned on the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase; Rapid Rewards bonus points, unless specifically designated as such; non-revenue travel, unless specifically designated as eligible; stops at intermediate cities on connecting or through flights; and charter flights. TQPs are not redeemable for travel on Southwest® or through the \"More Rewards\" site. Eligible credit cards: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card, or Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card.\n\nTier Qualifying Points For Business Cards: Tier qualifying points (TQPs) are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest Airlines® or when you, or an employee, use the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. (You'll earn 1,500 for each $5,000 in purchases annually. \"Annually\" means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and each 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date.) TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account. The following will not count toward qualification for A-List or A-List Preferred status: Rapid Rewards program enrollment points; Rapid Rewards reward flights; Rapid Rewards Companion Pass® travel; Rapid Rewards partner points except for TQPs earned on the eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase; Rapid Rewards bonus points, unless specifically designated as such; non-revenue travel, unless specifically designated as eligible; stops at intermediate cities on connecting or through flights; and charter flights. TQPs are not redeemable for travel on Southwest® or through the \"More Rewards\" site. Eligible credit cards: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card, or Southwest Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card.\n\n2Qualifying flights include flights booked and flown through Southwest and flights paid entirely with dollars, Southwest LUV Vouchers, gift cards or travel funds, and with no portion of the purchase price paid for with Rapid Rewards points. Cash + Points bookings will not earn Rapid Rewards points, tier qualifying points for A-List or A-List Preferred status or Companion Pass qualifying points.\n\n3Boarding positions will be automatically reserved for you and the Passengers on your reservation 36 hours prior to the flight. You and Passengers on your reservation will still need to check in within 24 hours of scheduled departure to retrieve your boarding passes. Some restrictions apply. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, your reservation must be booked 36 hours prior to scheduled departure; on group travel itineraries, priority boarding will only apply to A-List and A-List Preferred Members.\n\n4Free same-day change/standby\n\nSame-day change: On the day of travel, you can switch free of airline charges to another flight with space available departing on the same calendar day between the same origin airport and destination airport as your original flight. With the exception of A-List Preferred and A-List Members, Customers who purchase Wanna Get Away fares are not eligible for free same-day change.\n\nSame-day standby: You can list for same-day standby on an earlier flight via a Southwest Customer Service Agent at the airport or the Southwest app or mobile web. You will receive a message based on the contact preference selected during booking if you are cleared on the flight. For both same-day change and same-day standby, you must change your flight or request to be added to the same-day standby list at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of your original flight or the no-show policy will apply. If using the app or mobile web for standby, you must list your name 30 minutes ahead of scheduled departure. You will be required to pay any government taxes and fees associated with these itinerary changes but refunds will be provided. Your original boarding position is not guaranteed. Southwest Business Customers booked through travel agencies may need to see a Southwest agent at the airport for both a same-day change or standby listing. If an A-List or A-List Preferred Member is traveling on a multiple-Passenger reservation, same-day change will not be provided for non-A-List or non-A-List Preferred Members in the same reservation. On the day of travel, Companion Pass holders who have a Companion already booked and would like to use the same-day standby benefit can get added to the same-day standby list only in person at the airport with a Southwest Customer Service Agent located at the ticket counter or departure gate. See Southwest.com/standby for more details.\n\n5Priority Lane and Express Lane are designed to speed our Business Select and Anytime Customers, as well as A-List, and A-List Preferred Members, through check-in and security lines. Priority Lane is at the Southwest check-in counter, and Express Lane is at the security checkpoint. To find where this is available, visit the Airport Information Page and check the amenities section in the dropdown for the respective airport.\n\nRapid Rewards terms and conditions apply. Review the full terms here.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards™ Credit Cards are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Member FDIC."
