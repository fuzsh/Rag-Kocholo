        "text": "While many airlines are grappling with the problem of how to make the upper tiers of their exclusive frequent flyer programs, well, exclusive again, Southwest is going against the grain and is about to make it a whole lot easier to acquire the airline’s version of elite status.\n\nOn Monday, the Dallas-based carrier outlined five enhancements to its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program, which have been generally well received by a community of flyers who have become accustomed to wearily accepting devaluations masquerading as enhancements.\n\nTwo of the five enhancements lower the number of flights required to attain Southwest’s A-List and A-List Preferred status, while the third enhancement reduces credit card spending requirements to achieve tier-qualifying points.\n\nThe fourth enhancement adds a new benefit for A-List Preferred members in the form of two free premium drinks per flight, while the fifth and final enhancement will see Southwest introduce a new ‘Cash + Points’ booking option from Spring 2024.\n\nWhat is A-List and A-List preferred?\n\nAside from its sought-after Companion Pass, the Southwest Rapid Rewards program has two main frequent flyer tiers – A-List and A-List Preferred.\n\nA-List status is normally achieved by flying 25 one-way flights within a calendar year or achieving 35,000 tier qualifying points through credit card spend, whereas A-List Preferred status requires 50 flight segments or 70,000 tier qualifying points.\n\nA-list status includes the following benefits:\n\nPriority boarding\n\n24% point bonus on qualifying flights\n\nSame-day change and same-day standby\n\nPriority check-in\n\nand a dedicated phone line for customer services\n\nIn addition to the above, A-List Preferred status also includes the following benefits:\n\n100% point bonus on qualifying flights\n\nFree inflight WiFi\n\nHow much easier will it be to acquire status?\n\nFrom January 1, 2024, Southwest is going to make it significantly easier to acquire A-List and A-List Preferred status.\n\nTo achieve A-List status, you’ll need to fly just 20 one-way flights in a calendar year or earn 35,000 tier qualifying points.\n\nTo achieve A-List Preferred status, you’ll need to fly just 40 one-way qualifying flights or earn 70,000 tier qualifying points.\n\nAs you can see, the tier qualifying point requirement remains the same, but from January 1, 2024, the minimum spend to earn tier qualifying points is being halved. Instead of earning 1,500 tier qualifying points for every $10,000 spent on a Southwest cobranded credit card, the spending requirement will be reduced to just $5,000.\n\nThis applies to the following credit cards:\n\nRapid Rewards Premier\n\nRapid Rewards Premier Business\n\nRapid Rewards Priority\n\nRapid Rewards Performance Business\n\nWhat about the free drinks for A-List Preferred members?\n\nStarting on November 6, 2023, Southwest will add a new benefit for A-List Preferred members in the form of two free premium drinks per flight. The drinks coupon will be added directly to your mobile boarding pass, and any unused coupons can’t be rolled over to the next flight.\n\nWhat do we know about the new Cash + Points booking option?\n\nNot a lot at the moment.\n\nFrom Spring 2024 (the exact date is yet to be confirmed), Southwest will allow customers to pay for flights with a combination of cash and points. Redemptions will start with as few as 1,000 points but Southwest has given away little else about how the program will work.\n\nWhat we do know, however, is that not all customers will see a Cash + Points options during the initial rollout next year. It’s also important to note that Cash + Points payments won’t earn Rapid Rewards points or tier-qualifying points or either A-List and A-List Preferred Status or Companion Pass."
