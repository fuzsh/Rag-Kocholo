        "text": "The Southwest Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program is very different from those of legacy carriers. For instance, Southwest doesn’t have business class, and unlike most airlines, it offers perks like free checked baggage and free cancellation to all, and not just elite customers. So while Rapid Rewards does have elite tiers, its perks and benefits are quite different from other programs.\n\nEarning Status\n\nThere are two elite levels and a special status in the Rapid Rewards program: A-List, A-List Preferred, and Companion Pass. Qualification requirements are as follows:\n\nA-List: 20 one-way qualifying flights or 35,000 Tier Qualifying Points\n\nA-List Preferred: 40 one-way qualifying flights or 70,000 Tier Qualifying Points\n\nCompanion Pass (not a separate tier, but a great benefit): 100 one-way qualifying flights or 135,000 Tier Qualifying Points\n\nUpgrades\n\nNone: Southwest doesn’t have premium classes of service\n\nRapid Rewards Bonus Miles\n\nA-List: 25% earning bonus\n\nA-List Preferred: 100% earning bonus\n\nCompanion Pass: Partner flies for free\n\nFee Waivers\n\nNone\n\nAirport Services\n\nA-List and A-List Preferred:\n\nPriority boarding\n\nPriority check-in and security lane access\n\nStandby priority\n\nDedicated A-List or A-List Preferred Member phone line.\n\nComplimentary Lounge Access\n\nNone.\n\nNotable Additional Rewards for Elite members\n\nA-List Preferred:\n\nFree Inflight WiFi\n\nCompanion Pass\n\nCompanion Pass allows you to fly a partner for free. This is probably the most generous free ticket of its kind, since not only are there no fare restrictions, but you can also use it with an award flight. That means you can get two seats for the price of one award ticket.\n\nOther Ways to Earn Status\n\nChase issues four Southwest credit cards that can help you get some tier qualifying points toward elite status.\n\nYou get 1,500 tier qualifying points for every $5,000 spent on the card, topped at 15,000 points per year. Note that these are not real Rapid Rewards points that you can use for award booking, but only status points.\n\nHowever, since Southwest doesn’t have upgrades or lounges, which are the most valuable perks for frequent travelers, the Companion Pass appears to be the most valuable. And it’s easy to reach, too.\n\nYou can become eligible for the Companion Pass by flying 100 qualifying one-way flights booked through Southwest® or accumulating 135,000 points per year in almost any way you want. You can get them by earning points with the Chase Southwest credit cards or transferring points from hotel programs with very few restrictions. As soon as you meet one of these requirements, you qualify for the Companion Pass, which is valid until the end of the next calendar year.\n\nPlease note that having the Companion Pass does not qualify you for A-List or A-List Preferred.\n\nEarning Elite Points on Partner Airlines"
