        "text": "Information about the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card has been collected independently by Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication.\n\nWith perks that set Southwest Airlines apart from the rest — including the ability to check two free bags and no change fees on all fares — it's no wonder the carrier is so popular among travelers.\n\nSouthwest Airlines currently offers flights to 121 airports throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as internationally to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, making it a great option for families, couples, solo and business travelers looking to get away.\n\nThe carrier is also known for its Southwest Companion Pass, which lets you bring a friend or family member along with you on any domestic or international Southwest flight for just the price of taxes and fees (usually just $5.60 per person for a one-way U.S. flight). Qualifying requires racking up at least 135,000 qualifying Rapid Rewards® points in a calendar year, and once you do, it'll be valid for the rest of the year you've earned it as well as the whole following year. Plus, those with a co-branded Southwest credit card automatically get 10,000 Companion Pass Qualifying points at the beginning of every calendar year.\n\nThe easiest way to jump-start your journey to redeeming Rapid Rewards® points for a free flight is to sign up for one of the airline's cobranded credit cards, or — if snagging the Companion Pass is not your main goal — a travel rewards card that lets you accumulate transferable points that can then be moved to the Southwest Rapid Rewards® loyalty program.\n\nBelow, CNBC Select details the best credit cards for casual and frequent Southwest flyers — and those who prefer to transfer their points to Southwest Rapid Rewards® from other rewards programs.\n\nBest for occasional Southwest flyers\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card\n\nRewards\n\nEarn 3X points on Southwest® purchases, 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on internet, cable, and phone services; select streaming. 1X points on all other purchases\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nEarn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nAnnual fee\n\n$99\n\nIntro APR\n\nNone\n\nRegular APR\n\n21.49% - 28.49% variable\n\nBalance transfer fee\n\n5%, minimum $5\n\nForeign transaction fees\n\nNone\n\nCredit needed\n\nExcellent/Good\n\nTerms apply.\n\nWho's this for? The Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card is for fans of Southwest who don’t fly often but are still looking to earn points to redeem for free flights when they do. With a modest annual fee of $99 and a welcome offer of 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, it's a solid option, points earned with this card count toward qualifying for the Companion Pass.\n\nThe card lets you earn 3X points per dollar spent with Southwest; 2X points per dollar spent with its hotel and rental car partners through Rapid Rewards®; 2X points per dollar spent on ride-share services, commuting and transit purchases; 2X points per dollar spent on certain streaming, cable, phone and internet services; and 1X points per dollar spent elsewhere. So, even if you only fly with Southwest a few times a year, you’ll be racking up Rapid Rewards® points in no time.\n\nCelebrate each anniversary with 6,000 points, as well as perks such as no foreign transaction fees, two EarlyBird Check-Ins per year, 25% back for in-flight purchases and 1,500 tier-qualifying points toward A-List status every time you spend $5,000.\n\nBest for frequent Southwest flyers\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card\n\nOn Chase's secure site\n\nRewards\n\nEarn 3X points on Southwest® purchases, 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on internet, cable, and phone services; select streaming. 1X points on all other purchases\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nEarn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nAnnual fee\n\n$149\n\nIntro APR\n\nNone\n\nRegular APR\n\n21.49% - 28.49% variable\n\nBalance transfer fee\n\n5%, minimum $5\n\nForeign transaction fees\n\nNone\n\nCredit needed\n\nExcellent/Good\n\nTerms apply.\n\nWho's this for?

New cardholders can currently earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nWhile there is a hefty $149 annual fee, there are no foreign transaction fees and you’ll have access to benefits such as a $75 Southwest® annual travel credit, four upgraded boardings per year (based on availability), 25% back on in-flight purchases, 1,500 tier-qualifying points toward A-List status each time you spend $5,000 and 7,500 points each anniversary.\n\nLike the Southwest Premier Card, the Southwest Priority Card lets you earn 3X points per dollar spent on Southwest purchases; 2X points per dollar spent with partners when you book hotels and car rentals via Rapid Rewards®; 2X points per dollar spent on commuting, ride-sharing services and transit; 2X points per dollar spent on certain phone, internet, cable and streaming services; and 1X points per dollar for all other spending.\n\nBest for flexible rewards\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card\n\nOn Chase's secure site\n\nRewards\n\nEnjoy beneﬁts such as 5x on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 3x on dining, select streaming services and online groceries, 2x on all other travel purchases, 1x on all other purchases, and $50 annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit, plus more.\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nEarn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

If you love traveling and dining and want to rack up Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, which can be transferred to Southwest, among other airlines, at a 1:1 ratio, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card could be a great choice. It is currently offering 60,000 bonus points as a welcome bonus after you spend $4,000 within the first three months of account opening. Those points are worth $750 when redeemed for travel through Chase Travel℠.\n\nOnce approved, you can earn 5X points per dollar for travel booked via Chase Travel℠; 5X points per dollar on Lyft rides now through Mar. 31, 2025; 3X points per dollar for dining, online grocery shopping (except Target®, Walmart® and other wholesale clubs) and using certain streaming services; 2X points per dollar for all other travel spending; and 1X point per dollar for all other purchases.\n\nWhile the card does come with a modest $95 annual fee, there are no foreign transaction fees. Its considerable list of travel benefits includes collision damage waivers for car rentals, trip cancellation and interruption insurance, baggage delay insurance, a 10% points boost to celebrate each card anniversary and a $50 annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit. You’ll also score special perks with DoorDash and more.\n\nPoint transfers from Ultimate Rewards® to Southwest are usually instant. Just note that transferred points do not count toward earning the Companion Pass. Alternatively, you can redeem your points toward Southwest flights at a value of 1.25 cents per point by calling the Chase Travel Center.\n\nBest for small business owners with a low annual fee\n\nSouthwest® Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card\n\nOn Chase's secure site\n\nRewards\n\nEarn 3X points on Southwest® purchases; 2X points on local transit and commuting, including rideshare; 2X points on Rapid Rewards® hotel and car partners; 1X points on all other purchases\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nEarn up to 120,000 points.

While this can’t be done directly through the Chase travel portal, you can call the Chase Travel Center at (855) 233-9462 and redeem your points at a fixed rate of 1 to 1.5 cents per point, depending on what card you have.\n\nWhile it wouldn't provide the best value, you could also transfer points to Southwest Rapid Rewards® from Marriott Bonvoy® at a 3:1 ratio — or from American Express Membership Rewards® points to Marriott Bonvoy® at a 1:1 ratio and then to Southwest at that same 3:1 ratio.\n\nThings to consider before applying for a Southwest credit card\n\nBe aware that the Southwest credit cards are issued by Chase so you'll have to adhere to its notorious 5/24 rule, which could cause you to be denied any new Chase cards if you've already applied for five credit cards within the last 24 months. You also may be disqualified from receiving a Southwest cobranded credit card if you already have one or have received a new cardmember bonus within the past 24 months. The one exception to this is if you have a personal Southwest card and are applying for a business card, and vice versa.\n\nEarning the Southwest Companion Pass\n\nYou'll need to earn 135,000 qualifying points to earn the Southwest Companion Pass. If you're not a frequent Southwest flyer, it's still possible to earn enough points to get the Companion Pass. Remember that these activities all earn qualifying points:\n\nPoints from Southwest credit card welcome bonuses, including both personal and business cards\n\nPoints earned from regular spending on Southwest credit cards\n\n10,000 automatic qualifying points for Southwest co-brand credit card holders\n\nFor more details and ways to earn qualifying points, check out our guide to earning the Southwest Companion Pass.\n\nBottom line\n\nThere's a travel rewards credit card for every type of consumer, whether or not you consider yourself to be a frequent flyer with Southwest. The co-branded Southwest cards offer useful perks for loyal flyers, but if you don't want to fully commit to the airline, consider a card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards® points as you'll have greater flexibility in redeeming your rewards.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.
