        "text": "Who Is Southwest Rapid Rewards Good For?\n\nWith its lack of seating assignments, checked bag charges, and change and cancellation fees, Southwest has never fit the mold of your average American airline. It’s gone even farther on its own path since its merger with AirTran.\n\nBy getting rid of AirTrans Atlanta base, Southwest has confirmed its rejection of the usual hub-and-spoke system in favor of non-stop flights between regional cities. But as it has grown in the past few years, it has also added more service to major cities like New York and Chicago, turning it into formidable competition for the major domestic airlines.\n\nPROGRAMALLIANCECURRENCY RAPID REWARDSNONEPOINTS POINTS TRANSFER PARTNER\n\nCHASE ULTIMATE REWARDS AIRLINE PARTNERS NONE\n\nLike the much-maligned Delta 2015 program, Southwest confers points based on how much you paid for your ticket and what type of fare it is:\n\nWanna Get Away fares earn six points per dollar\n\nAnytime fares earn 10 points per dollar\n\nBusiness Select fares earn 12 points per dollar\n\nIf you do a lot of domestic travel and value an airline that lets you rack up points quickly and gives perks just as quickly, Southwest could be a good fit for you.\n\nFocus Cities:\n\nBaltimore-Washington International Airport\n\nChicago Midway International Airport\n\nDallas Love Field\n\nDenver International Airport\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\n\nLambert-St. Louis International Airport\n\nLos Angeles International Airport\n\nMcCarran International Airport\n\nNashville International Airport\n\nOakland International Airport\n\nOrlando International Airport\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport\n\nSan Diego International Airport\n\nWilliam P. Hobby Airport (Houston)\n\nHow Can You Use Southwest Rapid Rewards Points?\n\nJust as earning Rapid Rewards points is linked to the amount you spent on your ticket, spending them is linked to the cash price of the itinerary you’re looking to book.\n\nYou can use Southwest Rapid Rewards points to book three different types of fares: Business Select, Anytime, and Wanna Get Away.\n\nSince Southwest doesn’t have separate first or business classes, the business select fare, which comes with some of the perks you’d usually get in upper class, is the closest you can get. Business Select fares include priority boarding and a guaranteed seat in the front of the plane, priority securing screening, and a premium drink coupon.\n\nAnytime fares are your typical standard award, offering a high redemption rate just a touch below the Business Select fares. These awards are available as long as there are still seats available on the flight, though Business Select and Wanna Get Away awards are capped. The cheaper Wanna Get Away fares are changeable but not completely refundable.\n\nProgram perks:\n\nNo blackout dates on award bookings\n\nNo booking fees\n\nNo change fees\n\nNo cancellation fees\n\nOne-way awards\n\nBooking quirks:\n\nPoints expire after 24 months with no activity on the account\n\nNo partner airlines means that international awards are restricted to Mexico and the Caribbean\n\nNo ability to select seats\n\nAdditional points may be required when changing award reservations if the cash price of the itinerary has changed\n\nNo stopovers\n\nBest value awards:\n\nDue to its cash fare-based redemption system, there aren’t any particular routes or regions that give a better mile value than others. However, the different fare types do provide a dramatically different redemption value, beginning with around 1.4-1.8 cents per point value on the basic Wanna Get Away fare.\n\nThese are not only the cheapest cash and award flights, but also the best value. The redemption rate declines rapidly as the perks of the fare improve, with the next level, Anytime fares, carrying a redemption rate around 1.1 cents per point.\n\nWorst value awards:\n\nDespite the extra perks of the Business Select fare, it’s the worst value you’ll get when redeeming Rapid Reward points, clocking in around 0.9-1 cent per point.\n\nDue to the high point-earning potential of Business Select fares, if your need to purchase a fare in that category, it’s better to buy it in cash and earn the points if possible.\n\nThe Good Stuff: Upgrades and Elite Status\n\nAs Southwest does not have a multi-class cabin, there is no separate seating area for business or first, but many of the amenities are included in the Business Select fare.After booking a trip, you can log into your Rapid Rewards account and upgrade Anytime fares to Business Select with a $15 to $25 co-pay depending on the length of the journey.\n\nSouthwest A-List Levels and Perks\n\nEach subsequent level includes the perks of the previous level unless stated otherwise.\n\nA-List: priority boarding, 25 percent bonus miles, priority check-in, priority security screen, dedicated phone line\n\nA-List Preferred: 100% bonus miles, dedicated A-List Preferred phone line, free inflight wi-fi\n\nAn additional tier level, called companion pass, allows status members to designate a companion who can accompany them on any Southwest flight they take by just paying the taxes and fees on the second ticket.\n\nAssociated Credit Cards\n\nSouthwest offers two flavors of credit cards the Rapid Rewards Premier Card and the Rapid Rewards Plus Card that are both available in business and personal versions.\n\nBoth the Premier and Plus cards offer 25,000 bonus points after a $1,000 minimum spend, allow you to use your Rapid Reward points on additional non-airfare travel awards, and earn 2 points per dollar on Southwest and Rapid Rewards partner purchases and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\nThe Premier card, which carriers a $99 annual fee, also gives cardholders 1,500 tier points per $10,000 spent on the card (up to 15,000 tier points annually, does not charge foreign transaction fees, and awards 6,000 points upon renewal. The Plus card awards a 3,000-point anniversary bonus."
