Thank you in advance.\n\nHello!\n\nWelcome to the Southwest Family!\n\nSouthwest does not partner with any other air carrier. Southwest flights are directly Southwest-operated. Thus, when you book with Southwest, you'll be on a Southwest flight served by a Southwest flight crew for every leg of your flight journey. No outside folks!\n\nReservations should be done directly via Southwest as Southwest flights/fares cannot be found or booked via a third-party search portal.\n\nHere's a few other key elements that make Southwest different:\n\nhttps://www.southwest.com/flying-with-southwest\n\nThis is a customer-to-customer forum so if you have any general questions of how to fly with Southwest, post them here and one of us customers will respond back. Questions specific to your Southwest flight reservations should be directed directly to Southwest Customer Service.\n\nWelcome to the family!"
