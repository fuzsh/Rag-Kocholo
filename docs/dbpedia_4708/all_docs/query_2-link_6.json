It can be for the rest of the year in which you earn it or the following year. Earning the Companion Pass demands plenty of traveling or spending on the Southwest credit card, but it provides unbeatable value to those who do.\n\nTips for Maximizing Southwest Rapid Rewards\n\nBook Early: Although there are no blackout dates on Southwest, making bookings as soon as possible ensures availability and frequently results in reduced point costs.\n\nConsider the Companion Pass: One of the most valued benefits of the Southwest Rapid Rewards program is the Companion Pass, which allows a companion to travel with you for free for a maximum of two years (excluding taxes and fees).\n\nStay Up to Date: Get alerts about specials and promotions by subscribing to Southwest’s emails.
