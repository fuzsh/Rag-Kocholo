Of course, point values depend on how you choose to redeem your points, as some redemptions hold more value than others.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards points.\n\n1. Book Southwest Airlines award flights\n\nThe best use of points is to redeem them for Southwest flights. Southwest Airlines award flights are tied to the cash price of flights, not an award chart, so how many points you need depends on the ticket cost.\n\nPoints can be used to book flights to over 100 domestic and international destinations.\n\n2. Use rewards with partners\n\nThe airline doesn’t offer flights to Europe, Asia and other popular international destinations. But through the Southwest More Rewards program you can redeem your points to book international flights on other airlines.\n\n3. Redeem points for hotels, dining and shopping\n\nHave points you don’t want or need to use for flights? Points can be used for hotel stays and rental cars, along with other experiences for card members. You can also cash in your points when you shop at select retailers or use them to buy gift cards."
