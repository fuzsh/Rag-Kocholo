(You’ll earn 1,500 for each $5,000 in purchases annually. “Annually” means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and each 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date.) TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account.

TQPs earned during a billing cycle on a eligible Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card from Chase are not available for qualification for benefits such as A-List and A-List Preferred status until they are posted to your Rapid Rewards® account.

Eligible credit cards: Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card or Southwest Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card.\n\nAccount Alerts: Delivery of alerts may be delayed for various reasons including technology failures and capacity limitations.\n\nAdding An Authorized User: All correspondence, including credit cards, statements, and notifications will be sent to the name and address on file for the primary cardmember. The primary cardmember is responsible for repaying all balances on this account. Authorized users will have the same account number and charging privileges as the primary cardmember but will not be financially responsible. Chase provides account information to the credit reporting agencies for all account users. This information could impact an authorized user’s credit score. When you tell us to add a user to your account, you’re confirming that you have a relationship with the person or people whose name(s), address(es), and date(s) of birth you’ve told us, that all their information is correct, and that you have their consent to add them. If Chase determines you’ve given us fraudulent name, address, or date of birth information or did not have such consent, Chase can close this account.\n\nAdding An Employee Card: If any employees are allowed to use the account, they will be authorized users and will have equal charging privileges unless individual spending limits are established for them. You, as the Authorizing Officer, together with the business are responsible for any use of the account by you, an authorized user or anyone else permitted to use the account. You, together with the business, are responsible for repaying all balances on the account. All correspondence, including statements and notifications, will be sent to you as the Authorizing Officer. By requesting to add an employee cardholder to the account, you represent all information provided is accurate and is for persons with which the business has a relationship. You also represent that the business has permission to provide the employee information to Chase and to add the employee as a cardholder. If Chase determines any information provided is fraudulent, Chase has the right to close the account.\n\nCompanion Pass: Companion Pass® qualifying points are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest®, points earned on Rapid Rewards® Credit Cards, and base points earned from Rapid Rewards partners. The following do not count as Companion Pass qualifying points: purchased points; points transferred between Members; points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, e-Rewards®, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club®; points earned from Rapid Rewards program enrollment, tier bonus points; flight bonus points; and partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase). No points nor tier or Companion Pass qualifying points will be awarded for flights taken by the Companion when flying on a Companion Pass reservation. Points earned during a billing cycle on a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card from Chase are not available for redemption or qualification for Companion Pass status until they are posted on your billing statement and posted to your Rapid Rewards account. Only points posted on your billing statements and posted to your Rapid Rewards account during the same calendar year are available for qualification for Companion Pass status. For example, if you make a purchase after your December billing statement cycle date, the points on those purchases will not count toward Companion Pass status in the year the purchase was made; they will appear on your January billing statement and post to your Rapid Rewards account in January. Companion Pass Qualifying Points Boost: As a Southwest Rapid Rewards Cardmember, you will earn one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points each calendar year. The boost will be deposited into your eligible Rapid Rewards account by January 31st each calendar year or up to 30 days after account opening. To receive Companion Pass qualifying points boost your credit card account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Only one credit card account per Southwest Rapid Rewards Member (Rapid Rewards Member must be the primary Cardmember on that account), is eligible for one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points per calendar year. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is not responsible for the provision of, or failure to provide, the stated benefits and services.\n\nSOUTHWEST RAPID REWARDS® PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Credit Card is brought to you by Southwest Airlines® and Chase. Southwest Airlines is responsible for the redemption of Rapid Rewards points toward benefits and services. The number of points needed for a particular Southwest flight is set by Southwest® and will vary depending on destination, time, day of travel, demand, fare type, point redemption rate, and other factors, and are subject to change at any time until the booking is confirmed. Rapid Rewards points can only be transferred to the primary Cardmember’s Rapid Rewards account. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at opens overlaySouthwest.com/rrterms. Southwest reserves the right to amend, suspend, or change the program and/or program rules at any time without notice. Rapid Rewards Members do not acquire property rights in accrued points.\n\nEnd overlay."
