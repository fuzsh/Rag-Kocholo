However, the one spot that frustrates me compared to other online booking experiences is having profiles that make it easier to book for my entire family. I fly with my wife and kids and it is really frustrating to enter their data, look up their rapid rewards account, and do this each time I need to fly.\n\nIs there any way we can get it that you can add people you fly with to your profile and then select them when booking?\n\nI also agree it would be nice to save frequent travelers info on our profile that way no matter which method you use to book you can just make a click or 2 and make life much easier and it would help when it comes to booking a flight with just a couple seats left as typing out all the info can make a difference in getting the flight or not.\n\nIf you are using an IPhone to book your flight maybe this will help for the time being.\n\nHow can my iPhone help store info for frequently booked travelers?\n\n--Blake\n\nYou don't have to even store it. Just use their RR number.\n\nAll info can be stolen by hackers. Not sure why this makes it worse.\n\nYou are on the internet. Anything can be stolen.\n\nThat is not a valid reason not to make a better feature.\n\nI am surprised this has not been done after all of these years."
