        "text": "Southwest Airlines is one of the major airlines in the United States for several reasons, including low fares to destinations all over the country, as well as a couple of international locations. Additionally, Southwest allows each passenger to check up to two luggage pieces at no extra cost. The airline is adding more perks for travelers to enjoy in 2024.\n\nChanges Are Coming To The Southwest Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program\n\nRapid Rewards is the name of Southwest’s loyalty program (it’s free to join). Enrolling in the program and using your account when booking flights can help you earn points that can be used towards future travel, including flights, hotels, and car rentals. Alternatively, points can be used on merchandise and gift cards.\n\nPoints can also be earned when making purchases with select airline partners. If you are low on points, they can also be purchased from Southwest’s website.\n\nStarting in November 2023, a few changes are coming to the loyalty program.\n\n1. Pay With Cash + Points\n\nCurrently, flights can only be booked with either points or cash. But beginning in spring 2024, members can pay for travel with points and cash. Flights will be able to be booked with as few as 1,000 points.\n\nHowever, when paying with Cash + Points, note that the flights will not earn Rapid Rewards points, tier qualifying points (TQPs) that would qualify a member for status, or points that count towards the Southwest Companion Pass®.\n\n2. Credit Card Spending Helps Members Get Tier Status Faster\n\nWhen those with a Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority, Premier, Premier Business, or Performance Business Credit Card spend $10,000, they get 1,500 tier qualifying points towards A-List and A-List Preferred.\n\nBut, beginning January 01, 2024, cardholders only need to spend $5,000 to be their 1,500 tier qualifying points towards A-List and A-List Preferred.\n\n3. It Will Be Easier To Get A-List Status\n\nAlso, beginning January 01, 2024, getting A-List status will be easier as members will only need to fly on 20 eligible one-way qualifying flights (or earn 35,000 TQPs) in a calendar year to get status. Currently, members must fly 25 flights (or earn 35,000 TQPs) to qualify for A-List status.\n\nA-List status comes with perks, including priority boarding, a 25% earning bonus on qualifying flights, same-day change, same-day standby, priority check-in, security lane access, and a dedicated member phone line.\n\n4. Also, It Will Be Easier To Get A-List Preferred Status\n\nThe current A-List Preferred status qualification also changes on January 01, 2024. Instead of flying 50 eligible one-way qualifying flights (or earning 70,000 TQPs), members can fly 40 eligible one-way qualifying flights (or earning 70,000 TQPs) to get A-List Preferred status.\n\nUnfortunately, the earning requirement for TQPs remains the same on both A-List and A-List Preferred statuses.\n\nA-List Preferred status comes with similar perks of A-List, including priority boarding, same-day change, same-day standby, priority check-in, security lane access, and a dedicated member phone line. However, members get a 100% earning bonus on qualifying flights and also access to free inflight internet.\n\n5. A-List Preferred Members Can Enjoy Two Free Premium Drinks\n\nBeginning as soon as November 06, 2023, members with A-List Preferred status will receive up to two complimentary premium drinks per flight leg traveling 176 miles or more. Drink coupons will be digital and will be shown on mobile boarding passes. But if a member has an unexpired paper drink coupon, Southwest will continue to honor it until its expiration date.\n\nSummary\n\nSouthwest Airlines is rolling out some changes, including the ability to pay for travel with Cash + Points and easier ways to earn airline status. These perks start as soon as November 2023. Unfortunately, Southwest is not planning to reduce the flight requirements to earn the coveted Companion Pass.\n\nRelated Articles:"
