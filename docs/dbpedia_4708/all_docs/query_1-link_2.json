Adding my rapid rewards points to their name should have it earn points since I am the one purchasing tickets. For example, I'll be buying tickets for my college student to fly home for holidays and such. Those tickets since they are purchased by me and my RR is added to their Frequent Traveler profile on my account under my RR earn points, correct?\n\nNope.\n\nYou'll earn RR points for the purchase (if done via a Chase RR card).\n\nOnly the named travelers earn points for the flights.\n\nEach person flying needs their own RR account. Sign up everyone so they earn points every time they fly.\n\nAs @dfwskier said, you can earn points for buying the flights if you use a Southwest branded credit card.\n\nThe frequent flyers listed on your account don't have anything to do with points earning, that just saves you the hassle of manually entering name and other info for people you buy tickets for. You cannot list your RR number on other people's tickets, it won't work and no one would get points.\n\n--TheMiddleSeat"
