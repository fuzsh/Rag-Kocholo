        "text": "Southwest Airlines is the worldâs largest low-cost carrier, but it does not have any airline partners. This means the points you earn for its Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program are only redeemable on Southwest flights.\n\nSo, how fast can you earn tons of Rapid Rewards points? Ultimately, thatâs up to you and the strategies you employ. Luckily, there are lots of easy ways to earn tons of Southwest Rapid Reward points.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Program\n\nTo earn points, you need a Rapid Rewards account. Once that is set up, youâll be ready to earn points from credit card sign-up bonuses, everyday spending, shopping portals, and more.\n\nSign Up for a Rapid Rewards Account\n\nThe Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards programÂ is a stand-alone frequent flyer program. Unlike loyalty programs such as American Express Membership Rewards, a Rapid Rewards membership does not require an affiliated credit card to start earning points.\n\nItâs that simple. While you do not earn any points for registering for an account, youâll need to create an account to start earning points. Southwest will offer bonus points through email promotions, so make sure youâre signed up for Southwest emails, too.\n\nEarn Rapid Rewards Points With Credit Cards\n\nUsing credit cards is by far the fastest way to earn Rapid Rewards, and you can earn tons of points with a simple strategy.\n\n1. Chase Ultimate Rewards Credit Cards (Recommended)\n\nThe Chase Ultimate Rewards program is the only bank partner of the Southwest Rapid Rewards program. While you might expect a co-branded Southwest credit card to be the best way to earn Rapid Rewards, you would be mistaken!\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards points are extremely valuable because you can transfer them to many different Chase transfer partners. Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer 1:1 to Southwest Airlines, so any points you earn on Ultimate Rewards cards can turn into Southwest Rapid Rewards points almost instantly. This is a much better strategy than just collecting Southwest Rapid Rewards points; youâll greatly increase your redemption options but can also redeem for Southwest flights as needed.\n\nUltimate Rewards-earning credit cards often come with amazing sign-up bonuses that can earn you tons of transferable points that can be used to book travel with Southwest.\n\nAnd donât forget, Chase Ultimate Rewards points are much easier to earn than Southwest Rapid Rewards points are when using one of Southwestâs credit cards.\n\nRecommended Chase Cards (Personal)\n\nGREAT STARTER CARD\n\nU.P.

Earn With the Rapid Rewards Shopping Portal\n\nCredit cards aside, there are a lot of other ways to earn points on everyday purchases through the Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping portal.\n\nTo ensure you earn the bonuses for your purchases:\n\nGo toÂ Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping.\n\nSign up or sign in to your Rapid Rewards account.\n\nSearch for and select a product or storeâs bonus points offer.A new browser window should open and look similar to this:\n\nShop as you normally would through the storeâs website.\n\nWhen you proceed to checkout, ensure youâre still logged in to Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping so you receive the bonus points for your purchase.\n\nKeep in mind that your purchase can be made with any credit card. However, if you use yourÂ Southwest credit card, you will be earning 1 point per dollar for your purchaseÂ in addition toÂ the bonus points offered through the shopping portal. This is a great way to rack up points!\n\n7. Earn With the Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining Program\n\nLike several other airlines, Southwest participates in the Rewards Network dining platform. Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining makes it easy for you to earn Rapid Rewards points when you eat out at restaurants all over the U.S.\n\nMembership is free; you simply register for an account, add any credit card, and start eating to earn. To sign up for the Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining program:\n\nGo to Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining and create an account.\n\nGo to your account on the upper right side and click Manage Account>Linked Cards. Then add any credit card you like (try to use one that earns bonus points on dining).\n\nSearch for restaurants near you by using the search engine at the top of the page.\n\nSimply eat at participating restaurants and use the registered credit card when you pay.\n\nUsually, you will earn 3 points per dollar at participating restaurants, bars, and clubs after opting into Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining email notifications. Youâll also earn 10 points for every review you complete after each dining experience.\n\nCheck out the BonusesÂ section of the site to find promotions that will earn you even more points. For new members, there are often several options for earning bonus points such as:\n\nSign Up BonusÂ â Earn 1,000 bonus points for signing up, dining ($25 or more) at a participating restaurant within 30 days, and submitting a review for the restaurant.\n\nFirst Step Bonus â When you reach 1,500 points, youâll be given an additional 500 points just because.\n\nThank You Bonus â After youâve earned the First Step Bonus, every time you earn another 1,000 points youâll be rewarded an additional 300 points.\n\nBottom Line: Shopping online through the Southwest Rapid Rewards Shopping and dining out at participating Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining restaurants will help you earn tons of additional points.\n\n8. Earn With Shopping Partners\n\nSouthwest Airlines has a few specialty shopping partners that offer bonus Rapid Rewards points:\n\n1-800-Flowers â Earn 1,000 points for each order of $29.99 or more when using the code RR22\n\nHarry & David â Earn 1,000 points for each order of $29.99 or more when using the code SW44\n\nHome Chef â Earn 1,200 points per box (up to 5 boxes), plus get 10% off your first order\n\nLaithwaites â Earn 2,000 points with your introductory wine club case; earn 1,000 points on each future club case\n\nEarn Southwest Rapid Rewards Points Through Travel\n\nFinally, we arrive at the tried and true method of earning Rapid Rewards points: flying on Southwest Airlines.\n\n9. Airfare and Airline Purchases\n\nLuckily, with Southwest-branded credit cards, you earn bonusÂ points for every dollar spent on purchases with Southwest Airlines. This includes all flights, inflight purchases, and Southwest gift cards purchased through Southwest Airlines.\n\nHowever, you donâtÂ needÂ one of these cards to start earning on your travel purchases. Your Rapid Rewards membership will start earning you points on any Southwest flight you purchase regardless of the card you use to pay.\n\nSince Southwest Airlines is an independent carrier, you can only earn Rapid Rewards points on Southwest flights.\n\nBeing limited to Southwest for earning points on airfare may seem like a major disadvantage, but you can earn a lot of Rapid Rewards points each time you fly with Southwest.\n\nHot Tip: Donât think you are only stuck with âboringâ domestic destinations either. Southwest flies to many international destinations, too (including some that might surprise you).\n\nThe points you will earn on Southwest flights are much more than many other airlines tend to offer. If you love flying Southwest, then this is wonderful news!\n\nOf course, the number of points you earn will depend on the class ticket you purchase.\n\nWanna Get Away: 6x fare\n\nWanna Get Away Plus: 8x fare\n\nAnytime: 10x fare\n\nBusiness Select: 12x fare\n\nPoints earned also depend on your status or tier as a Rapid Rewards member.\n\nTiers are reached in a variety of ways, including flying on Southwest flights. Aside from the base or general member tier, the achievable tiers are A-List and A-List Preferred.\n\nIf youâre able to reach either of these tiers, you will have the chance to earn more points on each flight than a general member.\n\nAlong with other perks like priority boarding, youâll receive bonus points with each tier:\n\nA-List:Â 25% bonus Rapid Rewards points\n\nA-List Preferred:Â 100% bonus Rapid Rewards points\n\nThis might seem like a lot to calculate, but itâs a pretty simple calculation. First, determine your base fare (without taxes and fees) and fare class.\n\nOnce you have the info, you simply multiply these numbers. Then add additional points if you have A-List or A-List Preferred status.\n\nFor example, if your base fare is $250, you would earn 1,500 points if it was a Wanna Get Away ticket (6x points). If you had A-List status, that flight would earn 1,875 points and if you had A-List Preferred status, it would earn 3,000 points.\n\nBottom Line: A-List Preferred members in Business Select seats will earn the most points on Southwest flights.\n\n10. Car Rentals and Other Transportation\n\nNeed to rent a car? You can earn bonus points on your rentals by booking through Southwest.\n\nHereâs how many points you can earn on your car rentals:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE\n\n11. Book Hotels With Southwest Hotels\n\nSouthwest Hotels gives you options to earn Rapid Rewards points for hotel bookings. The site often runs specials offering anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 extra points per stay, making it a good alternative to booking hotels through Expedia, Orbitz, and other booking companies.\n\nIn the absence of a promotion, youâll earn an extra 1 point per $1 spent on hotels booked through Southwest Hotels.\n\n12. Book Hotels Through Rocketmiles\n\nRocketmiles is another way to earn Southwest Rapid Rewards on hotel bookings. With Rocketmiles you can earn up to 10,000 Rapid Rewards points per night on hotel stays. While most stays probably wonât earn quite that much, itâs still a good way to earn extra Rapid Rewards points.\n\n13. Earn Points With Hotel Partners\n\nYou can earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points by staying at select hotel chains.

Transfer Points From Hotel Partners\n\nYou can transfer hotel points you earn through hotel co-branded credit cards and loyalty programs, but it is a terrible use of points. If you are in a pinch and really need Rapid Rewards points, it might be a good move. Otherwise, use hotel points for hotel award stays to get much more value out of them.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE\n\n15. Book Vacation Packages\n\nSouthwest offers some great vacation package deals, and youâll earn Rapid Rewards points when you book them through Southwest Vacations.\n\nThe points earned on each vacation vary depending on the package you choose and your status as a Rapid Rewards member.\n\nSpecialty Earnings Opportunities for Southwest Rapid Rewards Points\n\nSouthwest Airlines provides a few ways to earn Rapid Rewards that you might not expect.\n\n16. Home Services Purchases\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards has partnered with a few energy companies that will earn you bonus points for enrolling and remaining with them. These partnering companies offer special bonuses for Southwest Rapid Rewards members:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE\n\nBe wary of these offers! You can definitely earn a lot of points, but those points may not outweigh the cost of the product or service.\n\nYou should always consider the cost of the services, as well as the terms and conditions, before diving in simply to earn extra points.\n\n17. Buy Gas for Your Car\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards and Marathon gas stations have teamed up to reward Marathon MakeItCount members with Rapid Rewards points at the pump.\n\nTo take earn Rapid Rewards points when filling up your car, simply sign up for a MakeItCount rewards account and link your Rapid Rewards account on Marathonâs website. Then, youâll earn 1 Rapid Rewards point per gallon and bonus points on in-store purchases.\n\n18. Fill Out Surveys for Rapid Rewards Points\n\nSurveys take time and the points earned arenât astronomical, but if you need a few more points for an award booking, taking a survey for points might make sense.\n\nWith that in mind, Southwest has partnered with e-Rewards and Rewards for Opinions.\n\nThere is no public registration directly with e-Rewards.
