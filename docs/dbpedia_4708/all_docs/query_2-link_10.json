        "text": "Southwest Airlines Overview\n\nWhile Southwest started as a budget airline, today itâs one of the largest U.S. airlines. Southwest has continued to expand its offerings with flights to Hawaii and several popular international destinations, including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.\n\nDespite difficulties at the end of 2022 that resulted in an operational meltdown, Southwest remains a favorite airline for many travelers due to its customer-friendly policies, such as free checked bags and no change fees.\n\nRapid Rewards is the airlineâs loyalty program that allows passengers to earn and use points for flights.\n\nHow To Join Southwest Rapid Rewards\n\nVisit the Southwest website and click Create account to join for free.\n\nHow To Sign In to Your Rapid Rewards Account\n\nYou can sign in to your Rapid Rewards account on the Southwest.com homepage. Youâll need your account number or username and password.\n\nViewing Your Account Activity\n\nAfter logging in, click on My Account to see a summary of your trips, points, promotions, and progress toward elite status.\n\nPoints Expiration\n\nRapid Rewards points donât expire if your account is open and in good standing.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Elite Status and Companion Pass\n\nThere are 2 levels of Southwest Airlines elite status â A-List and A-List Preferred. The Southwest Companion Pass isnât technically an elite status, as having the pass doesnât come with any elite benefits, but it offers huge perks when flying on Southwest Airlines.\n\nSouthwest A-List Status\n\nSouthwest A-List status is earned after flying 20 qualifying one-way flights or earning 35,000 tier-qualifying points in a calendar year.\n\nTier qualifying points are only earned in 2 ways â through paid Southwest flights or credit card spending. You can earn 1,500 TQP per $5,000 spent on select Southwest credit cards\n\nA-List status comes with the following benefits:\n\n25% point bonus\n\nDedicated A-List member phone line\n\nFree same-day standby\n\nPriority boarding\n\nPriority check-in and security\n\nSame-day confirmed changes with no difference in base fare\n\nSouthwest A-List Preferred Status\n\nSouthwest A-List Preferred status is earned after flying 40 qualifying one-way flights or earning 70,000 tier-qualifying points in a calendar year. It comes with all of the benefits of A-List status plus these additional perks:\n\n100% point bonus\n\nDedicated A-List Preferred member phone line\n\nFree inflight Wi-Fi\n\nSouthwest Companion Pass\n\nThe Southwest Companion Pass is considered one of the best deals in travel. It essentially lets you fly 2-for-1 for up to 2 years.\n\nTo earn the Companion Pass, youâll need to fly 100 qualifying one-way flights in a calendar year or earn 135,000 qualifying points in a calendar year.\n\nCompanion Pass qualifying points include credit card welcome bonuses plus points earned from revenue flights, Southwest credit card spending, partner hotel and car rentals, Rapid Rewards dining, and Rapid Rewards shopping.\n\nAfter earning the Companion Pass, you can add a companion to any Southwest ticket for the rest of the calendar year in which you earn the pass plus the entire following calendar year. All you need to do is pay the taxes and fees for the companion, which are $5.60 for a domestic one-way flight (taxes and fees are higher on international flights).\n\nValue of Rapid Rewards Elite Status\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of A-List and A-List Preferred status is priority boarding. Southwestâs boarding process differs from other airlines because there are no assigned seats. Instead, youâre assigned a boarding position based on a few factors, including when you check in and your status level.\n\nHaving Southwest elite status removes the need to check in exactly 24 hours ahead of time and more or less guarantees youâll be able to get seats with your traveling companions â and wonât get stuck in a middle seat.\n\nIf you generally pay for EarlyBird Check-In or value not having to worry about your boarding position, Southwestâs elite status can be very valuable.\n\nHow To Earn Southwest Rapid Rewards Points\n\nThere are many ways to earn Rapid Rewards points.\n\nFlying on Southwest Airlines\n\nYou earn Rapid Rewards points for Southwest flights based on your fare type and price, excluding taxes and fees:\n\nBusiness Select: 12 points per dollar\n\nAnytime: 10 points per dollar\n\nWanna Get Away Plus:Â 8 points per dollar\n\nWanna Get Away:Â 6 points per dollar\n\nTravelers with A-List status earn additional bonus points.\n\nA-List:Â 25% bonus Rapid Rewards points\n\nA-List Preferred:Â 100% bonus Rapid Rewards points\n\nEarn Points With Travel Partners\n\nYou can earn Rapid Rewards points by booking travel through select travel partners.\n\nCar rental partners: Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National, Payless, Thrifty\n\nHotel partners: SouthwestHotels.com, Best Western, Radisson Rewards Americas, Choice Hotels, Hyatt, Marriott, MGM Rewards, Rocketmiles\n\nEarn Points With Shopping, Dining, and Specialty Partners\n\nSouthwest has a variety of ways to earn Rapid Rewards points without flying, including shopping, dining, home, and specialty partners that can help you earn more Rapid Rewards points.\n\n1-800 Flowers\n\nEmergency Assistance Plus\n\neRewards\n\nLaithwaiteâs Wines\n\nHarry & David\n\nHome Chef\n\nNRG\n\nRapid Rewards Dining\n\nRapid Rewards Shopping\n\nReliant\n\nRewards for Opinions\n\nEarn Points With Credit Cards\n\nSouthwest offers 5 co-branded credit cards:\n\nYou can also earn Rapid Rewards points through Ultimate Rewards credit cards since Chase and Southwest are 1:1 transfer partners.\n\nYou need at least 1 premium travel rewards card (marked **) to transfer to Southwest. As long as you have 1 eligible transfer card, you can consolidate all your Ultimate Rewards points to that card to then transfer them to Southwest (or any of Chaseâs other partners).\n\nBranded and Partnered Credit Cards\n\nYou can use several credit cards to earn Rapid Rewards points directly or through points transfers.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Credit Cards\n\nYou can earn Rapid Rewards directly with any of the 5 Southwest co-branded Chase cards.
