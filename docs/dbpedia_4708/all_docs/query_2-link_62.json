        "text": "This section is transcluded from Southwest Airlines fleet\n\nPassenger experience\n\nSouthwest solely offers economy-class seats, and does not have business- or first-class cabins on its aircraft. Still, Southwest does offer many amenities, as follows:\n\nThe company permits two free-of-charge checked bags per passenger, and passengers are permitted to change their flight up to 10 minutes prior to their flights without extra charge. In the event of a cancellation, passengers are refunded a travel credit in the amount spent on their ticket, and the credit may be used toward other Southwest Airlines or Southwest Vacations purchase. The credit does not expire.\n\nSouthwest offers free in-flight nonalcoholic beverages and offers alcoholic beverages for sale for $6 to $7 per beverage. Free alcoholic drinks are offered to passengers who are at least 21 on some holidays such as Valentine's Day and Halloween. They also have complimentary snacks on all flights. Southwest has become known for colorful boarding announcements and crews who sometimes burst out in song.\n\nPrior to 2007, Southwest boarded passengers by grouping the passengers into three groups, labeled A, B and C. Passengers would line up at their specified letter and board.\n\nIn 2007, Southwest modified its boarding procedure by introducing a number. Each passenger receives a letter (A, B, or C) and a number 1 through 60. Passengers line up in numerical order within each letter group and choose any open seat on the aircraft. A 2012 study on the television series MythBusters, found this to be the fastest method currently in use for passengers to board a plane; on average, it is 10 minutes faster than the standard method. The airline was also number-one on the 2020 Airline Quality Rating list.\n\nSouthwest has a \"customer of size\" policy in which the cost of a second seat is refunded for any plus-sized travelers who take up more room than one seat.\n\nIn-flight entertainment\n\nAs of September 2023, Wi-Fi costs $8, and allows for streaming live television, movies, streaming music, and app messaging. After completing a testing phase that began in February 2009, Southwest announced on August 21, 2009, that it would begin rolling out in-flight Wi-Fi Internet connectivity via Global Eagle Entertainment's satellite-broadband-based product. Southwest began adding Wifi to its aircraft in the first quarter of 2010. The airline began testing streaming live television in the summer of 2012 and video on demand in January 2013. As of September 2, 2023, live in-flight TV, movies, messaging (iMessage and WhatsApp) and real-time flight-tracking information via Wi-Fi is available to passengers, with full Internet access available at a fee for regular passengers.\n\nRapid Rewards\n\nSouthwest first began to offer a frequent-flyer program on June 18, 1987, calling it The Company Club. The program credited for trips flown regardless of distance. Southwest Airlines renamed its frequent flyer program Rapid Rewards on April 25, 1996.\n\nThe original Rapid Rewards program offered one credit per one-way flight from an origin to a destination, including any stops or connections on Southwest Airlines. When 16 credits were accumulated in a 24-month period, Southwest awarded one free round-trip ticket that was valid for 12 months.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, Rapid Rewards changed to a points system based on ticket cost. Members earn and redeem points based on a four-tier fare scale multiplier and the cost of the ticket. Changes also included no blackout dates, seat restrictions, or expiring credits. Since October 18, 2019, Rapid Rewards points do not expire as long as the member is alive. It also adds more options to use points.\n\nCorporate affairs\n\nBusiness trends\n\nThe key trends for Southwest Airlines over recent years are (as of the financial year ending December 31):\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Net profit ($m) 2,181 2,183 3,357 2,465 2,300 −3,074 977 539 Number of employees 49,583 53,536 56,110 58,803 60,767 56,537 55,093 66,656 Number of passengers (m) 118 124 130 134 134 54 99 126 Load factor (%) 83.6 84.0 83.9 83.4 83.5 52.4 78.5 83.4 Average passenger fare ($) 154 152 151 151 154 141 141 169 Fleet size 704 723 706 750 747 718 728 770 References\n\nHeadquarters\n\nThe Southwest Airlines headquarters are located on the grounds of Dallas Love Field in Dallas. Chris Sloan of Airways magazine stated they are \"as much a living, breathing museum and showcase for the 'culture that LUV built' as they are corporate offices.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2012, Southwest broke ground on a new Training and Operational Support building, across the street from its current headquarters building. The property includes a two-story, 100,000-square-foot Network Operations Control building that can withstand an EF3 tornado. It also includes a four-story, 392,000-square-foot office, and training facility with two levels devoted to each function. The new facilities house 24-hour coordination and maintenance operations, customer support and services, and training. The project was completed in late 2013, with occupancy beginning in 2014.\n\nOn June 2, 2016, Southwest broke ground on its new office and training facility known as Wings. The newest addition to the corporate campus is composed of a 420,000-square-foot, six-story office building, and a 380,000-square-foot adjoining structure called the Leadership Education and Aircrew Development (LEAD) Center that serves as the new pilot training facility. The LEAD Center has the capacity to house and support 18 flight simulators. It is designed to be expanded to accommodate up to 26 simulator bays. The building opened on April 3, 2018.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, Southwest announced an expansion of the LEAD Center to accommodate eight additional simulators for future operational and training demands. On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Southwest would be purchasing an additional 3 acres (1.2 ha) of land adjacent to its Wings and LEAD facilities. No additional details were disclosed.\n\nEmployment\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 ( ) , Southwest Airlines had 62,333 active full-time equivalent employees. According to The Washington Post, it uses the hiring motto of seeking people that have a \"Servant's Heart, Warrior Spirit, Fun-LUVing Attitude\". It also uses the internal practice of ranking \"employees first, customers second\".\n\nBob Jordan, formerly executive vice president of corporate services, became Southwest's sixth CEO on February 1, 2022, replacing Gary C. Kelly. Kelly continues as chairman of Southwest Airlines. Kelly replaced former CEO Jim Parker on July 15, 2004, and assumed the title of president on July 15, 2008, replacing former president Colleen Barrett. In July 2008, Herb Kelleher resigned from his position as chairman. Barrett left her post on the board of directors and as a corporate secretary in May 2008 and as president in July 2008. Kelleher was president and CEO of Southwest from September 1981 to June 2001. On June 23, 2021, Southwest announced that chairman and CEO Gary Kelly would transition roles in early 2022, becoming the carrier's executive chairman with the desire to serve in that role through at least 2026 at the discretion of the board of directors. Jordan also joined the board then.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, Southwest announced changes to the company's executive leadership ranks, with Thomas M. Nealon named as president and Michael G. Van de Ven as the airline's chief operating officer. On September 14, 2021, Southwest announced Nealon had decided to retire from his duties as president effective immediately, but would continue to serve the company as a strategic advisor. Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven was named as the company's president the same day, and remains COO.\n\nAbout 83% of Southwest employees are members of a union. The Southwest Airline Pilots' Association, a union not affiliated with the Air Line Pilots Association, represents the airline's pilots. The aircraft maintenance technicians are represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Customer service agents and reservation agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union. Flight dispatchers, flight attendants, ramp agents, and operations agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union.\n\nThe company has appeared on various \"best places to work\" list, with its employee culture mentioned by Travel and Leisure, CNBC, and Forbes. The company has also been named to Fortune magazine's \"Most Admired Companies\" list, reaching number 14 in 2021.\n\nSouthwest has never furloughed an employee. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company launched voluntary separation and extended time-off programs in 2020, and around 16,900 employees volunteered to take an early retirement or long-term leave. Roughly 24% were pilots and 33% were flight attendants. In late 2020, the airline issued some WARN Act notices and announced incipient pay cuts for many employees in response to pandemic impacts, but these measures were rescinded after the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was enacted on December 27, 2020, providing additional financial aid to US airlines.\n\nImpact on carriers\n\nSouthwest and its business model have had an influence on other low-cost carriers (LCC's). The competitive strategy combines a high level of employee and aircraft productivity with low unit costs by reducing aircraft turnaround time, particularly at the gate. Europe's EasyJet and Ryanair are two of the best-known airlines to follow Southwest's business strategy in that continent. Other airlines with a business model based on Southwest's system include Canada's WestJet, Malaysia's AirAsia (the first and biggest LCC in Asia), India's IndiGo, Australia's Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas (although Jetstar now operates three aircraft types), Philippines' Cebu Pacific, Thailand's Nok Air, Mexico's Volaris, Indonesia's Lion Air and Turkey's Pegasus Airlines.\n\nLobbying against high-speed rail\n\nSouthwest Airlines has a history of lobbying against high-speed rail, which it sees as a competitor for short-distance commuter flights. In the early 1990s, Southwest lobbied US Congress and the Texas Legislature to oppose a high-speed rail system between Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston, and filed three lawsuits against the initiative. In 1991, Southwest told Texas authorities, \"Rail has a romantic appeal, but this case cannot be decided on the basis of nostalgia or even a desire to emulate the rail service of France and Germany. The American reality is that high-speed rail will be viable in Texas only by destroying the convenient and inexpensive transportation service the airlines now provide, and only by absorbing huge public subsidies.\" In 1994, the high-speed rail initiative was cancelled. While several reasons led to the initiative's demise, most commentators attribute a key role to Southwest Airlines' aggressive campaign against it.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe company has always employed humor in its advertising. Former slogans include \"Love Is Still Our Field\", \"Just Plane Smart\", \"The Somebody Else Up There Who Loves You\", \"You're Now Free to Move About the Country\", \"THE Low Fare Airline\", \"Grab your bag, It's On!\", and \"Welcome Aboard\". The airline's slogan (as of 2022) is \"Low fares. Nothing to hide. That's TransFarency!\"\n\nIn March 1992, shortly after Southwest started using the \"Just Plane Smart\" motto, Stevens Aviation, which had been using \"Plane Smart\" for its motto, advised Southwest that it was infringing on its trademark. Instead of a lawsuit, the CEOs for both companies staged an arm-wrestling match. Held at the now-demolished Dallas Sportatorium and set for two out of three rounds, the loser of each round was to pay $5,000 to the charity of his choice, with the winner gaining the use of the trademarked phrase. A promotional video was created showing the CEOs \"training\" for the bout (with CEO Herb Kelleher being helped up during a sit-up where a cigarette and glass of Wild Turkey 101 whiskey was waiting) and distributed among the employees and also as a video press release along with the video of the match itself. Herb Kelleher lost the match for Southwest, with Stevens Aviation winning the rights to the phrase. Kurt Herwald, CEO of Stevens Aviation, immediately granted the use of \"Just Plane Smart\" to Southwest Airlines. The net result was both companies having use of the trademark.\n\nAccidents and incidents\n\nSouthwest has had nine accidents, including two aircraft hull losses and four deaths: one accidental passenger death in flight, two non-passenger deaths on the ground, and one passenger death from injuries he sustained when subdued by other passengers while attempting to break into the cockpit of an aircraft. The airline is considered among the safest in the world. No passenger has died as a result of a crash.\n\nSouthwest Airlines incidents and accidents, by date Flight Date Aircraft Location Description Casualties 1455 March 5, 2000 Boeing 737-300 N668SW Burbank, California The aircraft overran the runway upon landing at Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, injuring 44.
