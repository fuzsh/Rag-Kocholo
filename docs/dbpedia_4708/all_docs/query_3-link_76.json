        "text": "Rapid Rewards points are the reward currency for the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards loyalty program. The airline is known for being one of the most consumer-friendly in the U.S., thanks to popular policies like no change fees and two free checked bags on every flight.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards points are just as straightforward as the airline itself—a simple program where points don’t expire and there aren’t any blackout dates. One of its most significant highlights is the Southwest Companion Pass, which allows frequent flyers to take someone along with them that flies for free.\n\nSound like your kind of program? Here’s everything you need to know about earning, redeeming and using Southwest Rapid Rewards points to fly for nearly free and get that coveted Companion Pass.\n\nBefore you can redeem points, you’ll have to start by earning them. Do so by signing up for a free Southwest Rapid Rewards account here.\n\nHow To Redeem Southwest Rapid Rewards Points\n\nRedeeming Southwest points is relatively simple. Although you can redeem your points for other types of rewards, get the most value by redeeming them for flights. It’s easy to do so via the Southwest website. Just search for the flight you want, and click the section that shows that price in points (instead of cash). Select the fare class and flight you’d like, then purchase using your points.\n\nHow Much Are Southwest Rapid Rewards Points Worth?\n\nThe first thing to know about Southwest points is that the value is tied to the cash price of plane tickets, so don’t expect a clear-cut award chart with this airline.\n\nBut once you understand how much the points are worth, it’s fairly simple to see if you’re getting a good deal. Since there’s only one cabin class (economy), you don’t have to worry about premium economy or business class.\n\nHowever, you should know that Southwest has four different fares: Business Select, Anytime, Wanna Get Away and Wanna Get Away Plus. Each fare class comes with different benefits and points earnings, which we’ll cover more later on.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards Points Valuation\n\nIn order to figure out how much Southwest points are worth, we did some research to test things out. We priced out several Southwest itineraries on various routes and dates in both cash and points, dividing the cash rate by the points to assign a value for each and then taking the average.\n\nAfter carefully running through several itineraries, looking at plane tickets over the holidays (as well as during low-season and next summer to popular vacation destinations like Hawaii and Cancun) and everyday routes to spots like Denver, Nashville and Dallas (on both weekends and weekdays), we deemed the value of Southwest points to be 1.4 cents per point. Note that we didn’t take taxes and fees into consideration when calculating the value.\n\nWhen deciding if your redemption is a good value, divide the price of the ticket by the number of points. If the number is much lower than 1.4, you aren’t getting a good value from your points. If it’s around 1.4 or higher, that’s a solid redemption—go for it. That being said, since points rates are tied to the cash value of the ticket, in most cases, you should see a similar value when redeeming Southwest points for airfare.\n\nWhat Can You Use Southwest Rapid Rewards Points For\n\nFlights\n\nThe best-value option for using your Southwest Rapid Rewards points is to redeem them for flights.\n\nAlthough the airline doesn’t have award charts, it’s easy to toggle between the cash and points rates for flights after doing a quick search on the Southwest website for your desired flight. It’s simple to check (divide the cash rate by the points rate) if you’re getting a solid value, as it should be around 1.4 cents per point or even higher.\n\nOther Rewards\n\nCardholders of any of the aforementioned Southwest credit cards can also redeem points for things like gift cards, merchandise or events. When deciding if this is a good-value redemption, stick with that 1.4 cents per point. In most cases, things like gift cards or merchandise don’t offer nearly as high of a value as a flight redemption would.\n\nHow To Earn Southwest Rapid Rewards Points\n\nIt’s possible to earn Rapid Rewards points in many different ways; the most obvious is by flying with the airline.\n\nFlying\n\nWhen flying Southwest, you earn points depending on your fare class. Here’s the breakdown:\n\nBusiness Select: 12 points per dollar spent\n\nAnytime: 10 points per dollar spent\n\nWanna Get Away plus: 8 points per dollar spent\n\nWanna Get Away: 6 points per dollar spent\n\nElite members can earn even more points when flying Southwest: A-List members can earn 25% more points and A-List Preferred members can earn 100% more points.\n\nSouthwest Co-Branded Credit Cards\n\nEarn additional points and enjoy added perks using one of Southwest’s co-branded credit cards.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card\n\nWith the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card, you can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. It also comes with perks like a $75 annual Southwest flight credit, four upgraded boardings per year, 7,500 bonus points on the cardmember anniversary and 25% back on inflight purchases. The annual fee costs $149.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card*\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card* offers cardmembers 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening and has perks like 6,000 additional points every year on the cardmember anniversary and two early bird check-ins each year. The annual fee is $99.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card also offers 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. The annual fee is $69.\n\nAll points earnings from Southwest credit cards, including the bonus points, count toward the Companion Pass.\n\nBusiness owners can also earn points with the Southwest® Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card and the Southwest® Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card.\n\nShopping and Dining\n\nEarn additional points using Rapid Rewards Shopping, the airline’s shopping portal. It works by offering bonus points if you click through to certain retailers. The portal tracks your purchases using cookies in order to add the points to your account. Just click on the retailer you want to shop at via the Rapid Rewards Shopping website, then click Shop Now and you’ll be routed to the retailer where you can shop as normal.\n\nThis is an easy way to earn bonus points on purchases you’ll already make anyway, like holiday shopping or back-to-school buys.\n\nThe Rapid Rewards Dining Program requires you to sign up (you may also get a new member bonus for doing so). After you do, you can earn Rapid Rewards on every dollar spent (three points per dollar spent if you opt in for email communication, one point per two dollars spent if not) at participating restaurants.\n\nCar Rental, Hotels and Other Partners\n\nYou can earn bonus points with Southwest’s travel and lifestyle partners—which include brands like Marriott or Hertz. However, this may not be the best value, so make sure to do the math first. For example, Rapid Rewards members can earn 600 Rapid Rewards points for a stay at Marriott, but it could be a much better value to earn Bonvoy points for your stay instead.\n\nTransferring Chase Points\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards® points transfer at a 1:1 ratio to Southwest. Transfer points by logging into your Chase account and visiting your Ultimate Rewards homepage.\n\nHow To Earn the Southwest Companion Pass\n\nThe Southwest Companion Pass is one of the most coveted benefits of any airline loyalty program. Once you’ve earned it, you can choose one companion to fly with you for free (except for taxes and fees, which are typically $5.60 each way for domestic trips). Here’s how to get it.\n\nFlying\n\nFly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 125,000 qualifying points in a single calendar year for the Companion Pass. Starting in 2023, you’ll have to earn 135,000 qualifying points. The pass is valid for the remainder of the year in which you earned it, as well as the full following year. Qualifying flights are one-way flights booked directly with Southwest; flights booked on OTAs don’t count (and they won’t earn you points, either).\n\nIf you’re trying for the pass, remember that certain fare classes offer more points per dollar spent than others, and elite members also get additional points for flying.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nThe Southwest co-branded credit cards mentioned above offer limited-time bonus point offers for new cardholders that count toward the Companion Pass. You can earn points for every dollar spent on these cards (and more in certain bonus categories), so this is an easy way to ramp up those points earnings and move closer to obtaining the pass.\n\nShopping and Dining\n\nSouthwest points you earn from shopping and dining also count toward the Companion Pass.\n\nNote that purchased points, tier bonus points, points earned from program enrollment, gifted points and transferred points won’t count toward the Companion Pass.\n\nHow To Use the Southwest Companion Pass\n\nAdd Your Companion\n\nOnce you have the Companion Pass, it’s time to put it to use. Start by choosing your companion in the My Account section of your profile. Select the Choose Your Companion tab. Once you enter the required information in the “Enter Companion info” section, the Companion Pass Member Kit should arrive within 15 business days. If you would rather add your companion by phone, you can always call 1-800-435-9792 to do so.\n\nBook Your Companion’s Flights\n\nStart by booking your own flight. Once your flight is booked, look for it in the Upcoming Trips section of your account. Click “Add Companion” to begin booking their flight. Click continue, where you’ll enter payment details for the taxes and fees. Finally, select “Purchase” and you and your companion should be all set to fly.\n\nRedeem Your Southwest Rapid Rewards Points With Ease (and Earn That Companion Pass)"
