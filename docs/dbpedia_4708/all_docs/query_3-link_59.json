        "text": "Southwest points are usually worth about $0.014 to $0.016 per point for flight bookings. The exact value depends on the flight and type of ticket you book.\n\nUnlike the travel rewards offered by most frequent flyer programs, Southwest Rapid Rewards points have a relatively stable value. Regardless of where you're going, you'll likely get a value in or near that range.\n\nSome award tickets fall outside this range a bit. In our research, we found bookings offering values of below $0.013 per point, and others offering more than $0.017 per point. But there aren't any major outliers.\n\nThere are other ways to use Southwest Rapid Rewards points, including hotels, car rentals, merchandise, and gift cards. These redemptions offer a much lower value per point, with some of them getting you less than half as much value as you would on a flight redemption. For that reason, it's recommended that you only use Southwest points to book flights with the airline.\n\nCalculating the value of Southwest points\n\nTo calculate how much a large amount of Southwest points are worth, multiply the number of points by $0.014. That gives you a good baseline for their value.\n\nAlternatively, a simple rule of thumb is that 10,000 Southwest points are generally worth at least $140 in airfare. With this information, you can easily calculate the value of 20,000 Southwest points, 50,000, 100,000, and so on.\n\nHow to redeem Southwest points\n\nHere's how to redeem Southwest points for free flights:\n\nGo to the Southwest website.\n\nEnter your trip details in the flight booking tool.\n\nChange the type of currency from \"Dollars\" to \"Points.\"\n\nSearch for flights and choose the ones you want.\n\nComplete the checkout process.\n\nIf you're not logged in to your account with the Southwest Rapid Rewards program, the site will prompt you to log in before you check out.\n\nBooking a Southwest flight with points is very similar to booking one with cash. The only difference is that you need to switch the search from \"Dollars\" to \"Points.\" You can do this with the flight search tool or when viewing your search results.\n\nThere are no blackout dates for booking award travel on Southwest. If you can book it with cash, then you can book it with points.\n\nYou also have all the same search options available. For example, if you want to use Southwest's Low Fare Calendar and see prices in points, you can.\n\nHow do Southwest points compare to other airline miles?\n\nSouthwest points are some of the most valuable airline points on average. Rewards with other major airlines are typically worth an average of about $0.01 to $0.015 per point/mile.\n\nThere's a key difference between Southwest Rapid Rewards and most other frequent flyer programs. With other airlines, the value you get per mile depends heavily on the airfare you choose. You can often get a much higher value per point when you use it for more expensive airfare.\n\nFor example, if you use your airline miles to book a no-frills economy ticket, you may get $0.01 per mile or less. If you use miles to book international airfare in business or first class, you could get $0.03 per mile or more.\n\nThat's the tradeoff for the stable value of Southwest points. You're not going to get a low value from them, but you also won't find any of those high-value award ticket deals like you could with other types of airline miles and travel credit cards.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Southwest focuses more on domestic flights compared to other major U.S. carriers. If you primarily travel within the United States, then Southwest points will serve you well. Travelers who book lots of international flights may need miles with an airline that flies to more destinations.\n\nMaximizing your Southwest points\n\nYou can earn Southwest points by registering for a Rapid Rewards account, which is free of charge. While this is a good starting point, finding ways to maximize your rewards will help you save a significant amount of money. Fortunately, there are several ways to collect more Southwest points.\n\nGet a Southwest credit card\n\nSouthwest offers several airline credit cards with Chase, including consumer credit cards and business credit cards:\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card ($69 annual fee)\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card ($99 annual fee)\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card ($149 annual fee)\n\nSouthwest® Rapid Rewards® Premier Business Credit Card ($99 annual fee)\n\nSouthwest® Rapid Rewards® Performance Business Credit Card ($199 annual fee)\n\nEach of these credit cards earns Southwest Rapid Rewards points on purchases, which gives your frequent flyer account a big boost. If you spend $2,000 per month on your Southwest credit card, that's at least 2,000 points.\n\nIn addition, Southwest credit cards all offer sign-up bonuses. If you hit the spending requirement for a bonus, you'll earn a large chunk of Southwest points. Not only are these bonus points valuable, they also get you closer to Southwest's Companion Pass. The Companion Pass allows you to choose someone to fly with you free of charge, except for taxes and fees of $5.60 each way.\n\nUse Rapid Rewards Shopping for online purchases\n\nLike many airlines, Southwest has its own online shopping portal. From your Southwest frequent flyer account, you can go to the Rapid Rewards Shopping page to browse hundreds of different retailers. If you visit a retailer's site through the shopping portal and make a purchase, you'll earn Southwest points.\n\nSign up for Rapid Rewards Dining\n\nRapid Rewards Dining lets you earn Southwest points when you dine at participating restaurants. You can sign up for this program on its website and link any credit cards that you plan to use when you go out to eat. After that, any time you use a linked credit card at one of those participating restaurants, it will mean more points for your Rapid Rewards account.\n\nBook hotels and car rentals through Rapid Rewards\n\nFlights booked through Southwest will earn you Rapid Rewards points, but that's not the only type of travel that qualifies. Southwest also offers hotel and car rental bookings through Rapid Rewards partners, and these earn you points if you book them through Southwest's website.\n\nAs long as you're using your Southwest points for flights with the airline, you can expect to get at least $0.014 per point. That makes Rapid Rewards points some of the most valuable and easiest-to-use airline rewards."
