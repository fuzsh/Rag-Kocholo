Automatic or paper check redemptions made online or by phone are in increments of $25 cash rewards/2,500 points. Cash redemptions via a withdrawal from a Wells Fargo ATM or a rewards redemption to an eligible Wells Fargo account from a Wells Fargo ATM are redeemable in $20 increments only. You must have a Wells Fargo Debit or ATM Card in order to redeem rewards at a Wells Fargo ATM. There may be a maximum limit on the dollar amount of the rewards redemptions for cash that you can make each day at a Wells Fargo ATM.\n\nRedeem for Purchases allows you to redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards® online for a statement credit to your eligible Wells Fargo credit card account. To be eligible for Redeem for Purchases, transactions must be $1 or more and you must have enough rewards to redeem for the entire amount of the transaction. Statement credits are applied to your outstanding balance and you are still required to make any payment due on your account. Rewards redeemed for purchases will be deducted from your rewards account balance immediately and all rewards redemptions are final. Statement credits will post to your account in 5 – 7 business days. Redeem for Purchases is offered subject to the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and the Addendum applicable to your card. For additional details, visit Wells Fargo: Rewards Terms and select your card from the dropdown. Select \"+ Redeeming Rewards\" and navigate to the Redeem for Purchases section.\n\nPay with Rewards (\"PWR\") feature allows you to redeem your available Wells Fargo Rewards® (\"rewards\") online through participating PWR merchants towards qualifying purchase transactions with your eligible Wells Fargo Credit Card (\"card\") account. To be eligible for PWR feature, cardholders must first verify the PWR sharing preference setting is enabled. This preference can be set at any time by going to Pay with Rewards Preferences. When your PWR sharing preference is enabled, all cardholders who use and have access to your card, including authorized users on your card, will be able to view and redeem the rewards associated with that card through the PWR feature when the card is provided by you or your authorized users to a PWR merchant. Rewards are not earned on any portion of a transaction redeemed through the PWR feature. Transactions qualifying as eligible for PWR redemption may change at any time and without notice. Rewards redeemed through PWR will be deducted from your rewards account balance immediately and all PWR redemptions are subject to the Return/Cancelation Policy of the merchant. Refer to the Wells Fargo Rewards® Program Terms and Conditions and the Addendum applicable to your card, the participating PWR merchant User Agreement, and the Pay with Rewards Terms and Conditions for more details."
