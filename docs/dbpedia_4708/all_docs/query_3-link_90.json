        "text": "Thinking of joining the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards program? Hereâs everything you need to know about being a member.\n\nIn 2017, Southwest Airlines received the least amount of customer complaints, according to data released by WalletHub. Translated, that means Southwest is a trusted choice for travelers, and their loyalty program, Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards, more than lives up to the family name.\n\nFrom exclusive fares to industry partners, thereâs plenty to unpack with this rewards system. Hereâs the A to Z on a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards membership.\n\nBenefits Overview\n\nThere are a few different membership levels in the Rapid Rewards program, and each one comes with their own unique set of benefits. To start out, everyone has the ability to earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of exclusive promotions, ranging from limited-time points offers to special discounts.\n\nOnce youâve join Rapid Rewards, you can start working towards A-List membership. This status requires 25 flights or 35,000 points to reach (please note that flights and points have to be of qualifying nature). Perks of A-List membership include:\n\nPriority boarding\n\nFly By access (priority check-in and security)\n\nComplimentary same-day standby\n\nExclusive customer service line\n\n25% additional rewards points on select flights\n\nThe next level, A-List Preferred, can be acquired through 50 flights or 70,000 points. It includes all the benefits above, plus:\n\nComplimentary in-flight WiFi\n\nDouble rewards points on select flights\n\nAfter A-List Preferred, you can earn a Companion Pass. Itâs less of a third tier, and more of an added benefit — Companion Pass basically provides you with a complimentary second ticket for a friend or family member to join you on your flight. Earning Companion Pass is similar to earning the other two tiers, and requires 100 flights or 110,000 points.\n\nHow to Earn Points\n\nEarning points is crucial to advancing your membership and getting free stuff, so itâs lucky that Southwest makes it so easy. Booking a flight through the airline is the most direct way to acquire rewards, and the higher the fare, the more points youâll bag.\n\nLike many loyalty systems, Southwest also makes it possible for you to earn rewards through partnered programs. Increase your points supply when you purchase through the below.\n\nPartnered Hotels\n\nBest Western\n\nMarriott\n\nStarwood\n\nRadisson\n\nLa Quinta\n\nPartnered Car Rental Services\n\nAvis\n\nHertz\n\nBudget\n\nThrifty\n\nNational\n\nOther Partners\n\nSuperShuttle ExecuCar\n\nHarry & David\n\nRapid Rewards Shopping (including Macyâs and other retailers)\n\nAs it would be a bit exhaustive for us to list every single partnership that Southwest boasts, this is meant to serve as a sample. For more partners, visit their website.\n\nA third option for points accumulation is through a Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card. There are a few different card types, like Plus and Premier, but for work travelers, youâll want to take a look at Premier Business. This card is catered to the unique needs of corporate travel, and includes bonuses like 6,000 points on your cardholder anniversary.\n\nHow to Spend Points\n\nThe best part of any rewards program is, well, the rewards! There are as many ways to spend your points as there are to earn them with Rapid Rewards, and popular methods of cashing in are:\n\nFlights\n\nHotel stays\n\nCar rentals\n\nRetail and gift card purchases\n\nLuxury trips\n\nIf youâre thinking that a frequent flyer program will fit your needs as a work traveler, then Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards should definitely be a contender. With so many points, partners, and perks, youâll be redeeming your rewards in seemingly no time at all.\n\nBusiness Travel Life\n\nBusiness Travel Life is an online resource supporting the road warrior lifestyle.
