        "text": "Hello all!\n\nThanks to the wonders of Tronix and Fedex my US XBOX copy of Burnout Revenge arrived yesterday.\n\nBasically the game can be some upped in one word - FANBLOODYTASTIC!!!\n\nIf you like the previous games then this one is simply awesome and a must buy!\n\nPresentation is very slick and the menus are easy to navigate. The annoying DJ is out, there is a voice over to explain stuff but it's nowhere near as annoying. Music wise its a bit of a mixed bag - some Rock style stuff as per Burnout 3, but also this time some dancy stuff thrown into the mix too (Chemical Brothers, some BT mix, and sure I saw a Adam Freeland mix in there too)\n\nGameplay wise all the classic and great Burnout elements are there - the blisteringly fast speed, the extreme crashes, whooshing sound effects, and some intense racing tracks.\n\nTo me at least, things seem a little different pace wise this time. The computer cars seem to be a bit better in terms of AI now. It's not unusual to be taken down by the computer in spectacular style, but it's this fact that brings one of the new features into play - The Revenge Takedown! If a computer car takes you out, that car will become flagged, and if you then take them down you get a 'Revenge Takedown' - scoring these can get you points and trophies etc.\n\nThe other big change here is the 'Traffic Checking'. Where before hitting traffic resulted in crashing, this time around you can hit the traffic and get away with it - not to mention using them to your advantage! You can't hit all traffic, only traffic that is going the same direction as you, and only smaller stuff like cars and vans - anything like a bus and you crash as before. The Traffic Checking is very useful, not only can you clear the road with some well placed ramming, but you can also use the cars to take the computer controlled races down too! Be warned though the computer cars can and will use the traffic against you too, but so far I've found this to be quite rare.\n\nCrash mode, which was always a favourite of mine has been changed now too. I guess it could best be described as more of a 'Thinking mans crash mode'. Gone are all the pickups from Burnout 3 (2x, 4x, etc), but even so it's still possible to rack up some good scores. Aside from the crash junctions needed some more thought now - that is there are a couple of ways to tackle each junction, though this variety makes things a bit more interesting and more fun.\n\nThe other change to Crash mode is the starting. Now you have this bar next to your car at the start which moves up and must be stopped in a green area, and then down again, and again it needs to be stopped in a green area. Doing this correctly gets you a nice turbo start ready for destruction - do this wrong however and you either stall the car or blow the engine....\n\nLastly the Crashbreaker has changed a little also. Pile up enough cars and fill your bar to 100% and you get to hammer the B button to build up your explosion. You don't just get 1 though if after using it you pile up more cars and get enough it's possible to do it again and cause further damage.\n\nOther than that all the other modes are in, Burning Lap is the same as usual - speed around a course in a very tight time, Eliminator isn't lap wise now, it's someone gets eliminated every 30 seconds, Races are as normal as are the 3 race grand prixs. I haven't got as far as having the Crashbreaker available in races yet, but I have previewed it and it will add a nice extra dimension to racing.\n\nSignature Takedowns are still in and as fun as before, but also this time there are challenges for a course - I think 10 each - these include things like complete a race without crashing, get so many Revenge Takedowns etc - finishing all of these and you earn new cars.\n\nSorry for the probable crap post, never made a first play thread before!\n\nAny questions feel free to ask, but like I say, bottom line is if you liked the other games, you can't not like this one!\n\nCheers!\n\nIm not liking it as much as I did BO3 to be honest, some things are improved, some things are worse.... overall its not a huge step up.\n\nThings I hate:\n\n- Multiple Routes: The levels are well laid out but depending on the track it means you usually spend more time looking for them than concentrating on racing and they take away what I love the most about burnout online... and thats toe to toe action against other competitors.\n\n- Crash: No bloody replay and a stupid bloody golf swing-esque power bar to start. Why? I know its not realistic but its still about driving a car into traffic... this power bar has no place here... its not golf or ten-pin bowling.\n\n- Traffic checking: Ok its fun for about ooooh 5mins and then its like \"meh\". Occasionally you get the odd snooker angle and take out an opponent with a vehicle but for me it just doesnt gel with the overall risk of the game... which is still go fast and avoid crashing, isnt it?\n\nI love:\n\n- Level design: Forget multiple routes for a moment and what they've introduced. The levels are awesome and the air you can achieve of some of the roads is quite scary and fun at the same time. I would of preferred if these \"shortcuts\" didnt exist and you merely had more options for air-time.\n\n- The new graphical effects: The newspapers and dirty city rubbish, but most of all the new shaky-cam high speed effect... nice touch.\n\nOverall? Its the exact same game as last year with slight modifications under the hood. If you liked BO3 then this is the same but tweaked. Unfortunately some tweaks take away more than they add to the flavour... its a cool game, but could of been alot better.\n\nNext year at least support 8-10 players online..."
