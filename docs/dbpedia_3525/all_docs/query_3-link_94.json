        "text": "I wanted to share my pity party here instead of starting a new thread bc my story is similar:\n\nI've taken 25 tests, and I've averaged 169 on my last 5 tests. I took the october '15 exam, and scored a 161, which is lower than my Dec '14 exam (164). I also began studying a couple years back so I've seen almost all tests, but I've only BR'ed 25 tests.\n\nBefore my scores were released, I knew I'd want to take the Dec test again because I'm shooting for 174 so I took another PT on 10/19 and scored 172. With the Oct score release, I had a WTF of an unprecedented scale. My score was a huge shock to me because I had thought the test had gone pretty smoothly for me and I was not expecting any surprises. I don't consider myself to be a bad test taker, maybe a little more adrenaline than usual but nothing too concerning, and my test center was fine aside from a tiny desk. After seeing that score, I killed time doing a few games, few passages but I really wanted to prove that score was just a massive fluke. I took PT 46 today and scored a 161. WTF IS HAPPENING TO ME??!\n\nI know the popular answer around here is burnout. But if my brain doesn't feel burnt out, and really I've been taking things pretty easy the last few days, what else could this mean?! I want to take the Dec test so can't afford to take much time off either. Did anyone else experience anything similar? I've been glad to see my scores climb slowly but surely and this whole thing is rather soul crushing.\n\nThanks in advance for the constructive feedback; and honestly, glad to have found this community because........the internet is not safe out there..\n\n@lsatequalsfml said:\n\nI really wanted to prove that score was just a massive fluke.\n\nThis is the problem right here. You can't exact revenge on the LSAT by taking another PT and doing better. You're just trying to reward yourself through instant gratification and that's not the point of this whole enterprise. When you have a bad test, you need to take a step back and really dig into the BR and figure out what happened. It sounds like on this one you were at least overly hyped up to do better that you probably overlooked a lot of what was happening during the test thinking that you're entitled to a higher score for whatever reason you want to choose (you're wicked smart, you prepped a lot, you're special, etc.), but that is the wrong way to do this.\n\nPTs are a learning experience to help you succeed on test day by helping you recognize patterns and build your skills. Getting 10 180s in a row during PTs does not mean it will just happen on test day. You still have to go in and put in the work... EVERY SINGLE TIME... if you don't then you will pay for it. So rather than burnout I think your problem is complacency in that you think you can just cruise through a test because you have PT'ed in a given range previously. Each PT is its own challenge and needs to be respected as such so you can't just prove something was a fluke by increasing the quantity of PTs you take until a 170 randomly pops up. Think about how ridiculous it sounds when you talk about it that way. Rather than trying to get revenge on the test or prove a certain test wrong, you need to spend more time with the tests you score terribly on and see what happened so you can learn from your mistakes.\n\nAs a real example, I took 65 the other day and got a 172 timed/174 BR. The former was my highest ever and the latter was tied for my highest ever. I was feeling pretty awesome because I made significant strides to get my LR down to -2, I maxed out LG and just happened to bomb RC. I went way too fast during RC and paid for it because I was riding high on confidence and only circled two questions, then had about 6 or 7 confidence errors. I then followed that up with another great performance on the LR on 62 where I had my best section ever and then one that wasn't so great but they still balanced out to averaging -3 per section versus -5 or 6 where I had been. Because of my schedule and my kids I had to take the test all disjointed and ended up doing the RC and LG in the middle of the night and absolutely bombed both. I'm talking worst RC ever and tied for worst LG ever so I ended up with a 163 timed/170 BR. So I wasted all those gains on LR with really bad performances elsewhere.\n\nNow if I took your approach I would just throw the test down and take another one immediately, and then another and another until I was back in the 170+ range where I want to be. But that is wasting PTs and doing my learning process a huge disservice by ignoring all those teachable moments. Instead I did the games section over to see what went wrong and though it is a challenging section it is well within my skill level since I average about -1 on LG now. A simple misread on game 1 led to a bad split and once I hit 6 minutes or so I started to panic because I was spinning my wheels so I went to game 2, screwed around too long with layouts and was well into the teens timewise before I skipped to game 3. Game 3 is a weird double layer sequencing and grouping game that I inverted the game board for and it cost me a ton of time and at that point I knew I was fucked. I skipped to game 4, got it in 4 minutes and then started to go back but so much damage had been done with wasted time that I had to blindly guess on 8-10 questions or so. RC I knew I bombed in real time because I was trying a new method for the first time when I should have practiced it before but I just wanted to try it out so that was the bad decision I made there and it led to me spending 5 minutes just reading and marking up each passage versus the normal 2.5 minutes I spend reading the passage. I then missed 10 questions, two thirds of which were actually pretty easy when I went back to review. If I had jumped ahead to a new test I would not have taken the time to learn all the lessons I needed to so that I can guard against doing such ridiculous things in the future. I would advise you to go back to those tests that your underperformed on and really dig into what your issues were."
