        "text": "Between work, loved ones, and other responsibilities, it’s hard to find time to relax throughout the day. And without the opportunity to disconnect, you run the risk of developing burnout at work and at home.\n\nStudies show that 60% of Americans feel too busy to enjoy life, and the percentage is even higher for parents with young kids. New phenomena like telecommuting blur the line between workdays and at-home time, making it even more difficult to find time alone to relax and recharge during the day.\n\nSometimes, nighttime is the only time available to spend on self-care. In response, you might procrastinate sleep for a bit of downtime, which makes you even more tired. This trend is called revenge bedtime procrastination, and understanding what it is and why it happens can help you beat it.\n\nWhat is revenge bedtime procrastination?\n\nStaying up late from time to time isn’t uncommon. But revenge bedtime procrastination happens when late nights, in response to busy days, become a trend. The term comes from a viral tweet by journalist Daphne K. Lee who translated it from Chinese, where it’s more common, into English.\n\nThe Chinese phrase “報復性熬夜” describes employees who work long hours at demanding jobs and trade sleep for leisure time.\n\nAlthough it originated from the Chinese “996” schedule, where employees work six days a week from nine in the morning to nine in the evening, the English translation has grown to describe anyone who’s burned out and avoiding sleep because of it.\n\nThis is different from shift work sleep disorder (SWSD), which happens when working at night or at odd hours affects your sleep schedule. Revenge bedtime procrastination is all about what happens after work: mental exhaustion and your compensation for it.\n\nAnyone with workplace stress needs time to decompress, and it’s hard to sleep when you’re anxious. But adults need at least seven hours of sleep per night to stay healthy and happy, and staying up late to regain control of your time can negatively affect your health.\n\nWhy do people fight sleep?\n\nSleep procrastination is a reasonably new phenomenon, but so far, researchers have found it’s affecting women and students most of all. And there are many reasons outside of work why people don’t want to go to sleep.\n\nProcrastination patterns\n\nPeople who resist doing the things they need to do during the day are more likely to experience revenge bedtime procrastination. If you already have issues with self-regulation, it can be even harder to stick to a reasonable bedtime.\n\nSometimes, sleep is just another thing on your to-do list, and it’s more difficult to check off if you’re already struggling to stay productive.\n\nChronotypes and circadian rhythms\n\nSome people are naturally more active at night. Their natural chronotypes, or wake/sleep cycles, mean they have more energy later in the day and are more likely to stay up late. Paired with a busy schedule, your circadian rhythm could be the reason why you have trouble getting to bed earlier.\n\nAttention deficit disorder (ADD)\n\nPeople of all ages with ADD have trouble sleeping. They might have difficulty slowing their thoughts down to relax and fall asleep. Many factors contribute to the correlation between ADD and sleep, like environment and lifestyle, but a busy work schedule can also play a role.\n\nStress\n\nDifferent types of stress, like chronic stress, can make it consistently harder to sleep. Taking time for yourself during the day helps, but if you’re always thinking about work or other responsibilities, it might not be enough to solve the problem.\n\nThe detriments of revenge insomnia\n\nDowntime at night feels good in the moment, but losing sleep consistently can cause sleep deprivation. The effects of this stress on the body could become more serious if you don’t recognize them and change them.\n\nReduced cognitive function\n\nLack of sleep can lead to cognitive impairment during the day, affecting everything from your ability to concentrate to critical thinking skills. Over time, these adverse effects can lead to mental fog and productivity issues at work and in your daily life.\n\nMental health impacts\n\nPeople with poor sleep hygiene have an increased risk of mental health challenges. If you already suffer from anxiety, depression, or other mental illnesses, losing sleep makes it more difficult to recover.\n\nSuppressed immune system\n\nInsomnia decreases your body’s ability to fight off infection, making you more susceptible to disease and eroding the efficacy of vaccinations.\n\nRevenge bedtime procrastination is usually caused by a stressful work schedule, and if the stress makes you get sick more often, a lack of sleep could make the problem even worse.\n\nIncreased risk of heart disease\n\nPeople who don’t get enough sleep are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiac disease, heart attack, and stroke. Insomnia can also lead to weight gain and obesity, which often further strains the heart and circulatory system.\n\nPoor hormone regulation\n\nHormones regulate body functions and metabolism. Not getting enough sleep could potentially lead to hormonal imbalances and metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypoglycemia.\n\nElevated pain levels\n\nSleep is rejeuvinating, but it’s also an intensely active period for your body. While you doze, blood flow to your muscles increases, bringing more oxygen to tissues and stimulating healing processes.\n\nReducing the number of hours you spend sleeping — and giving your body time to rest and heal — can lead to more aches, pains, and stiffness when you wake up.\n\n9 tips on how to deal with revenge bedtime procrastination\n\nThere are many reasons why you don’t want to sleep at the end of the day, but developing a healthy bedtime routine can help you return to a regular sleep pattern that makes you feel refreshed and rested. Try these approaches to stop procrastinating sleep and improve your bedtime schedule.\n\n1. Prioritize rest\n\nThe first step toward establishing a healthy sleeping routine is to make rest a priority, whether that’s at night or throughout the day. Create a list of reasons why you want to get to bed on time: energy, productivity, mood, motivation, and other effects you’re striving for.\n\nReview your list whenever you feel like you’re returning to old patterns to remember why you’re trying to get more rest and make more intentional choices at bedtime.\n\n2. Stay awake\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but taking a daytime nap can negatively impact your ability to fall asleep at night. Unless you’re actively nodding off, try to stick to your bedtime schedule. If you need to sleep, keep naps short, and try your best to fix your sleep schedule as soon as you can.\n\n3. Develop a sleep routine\n\nHaving a consistent pre-bedtime routine can prepare the mind and body for sleep. Take a shower, brush your teeth, do some yoga, read a book, write in a journal, or whatever helps you wind down.\n\nStick to your routine to improve your bedtime mindset, and try to go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Over time, your brain will recognize what the routine means and you’ll have an easier time falling asleep.\n\n4. Avoid stimulants\n\nTobacco and alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns, so avoid them before bed or, if you can, avoid them entirely. On the same note, consuming a sugary drink before bedtime can make you feel restless and get less sleep.\n\n5. Review your agenda\n\nA busy next day is a prime motivator of sleep procrastination, so review your schedule and plan ahead. Are there any tasks eating up your time that you can simplify or do away with altogether?\n\nFigure out how to get them off your to-do list to relieve some of your anticipation and reluctance to start your day. Sometimes, your time and energy are better spent resting.\n\n6. Schedule personal time\n\nAdd time to yourself to your daily schedule so meetings or other responsibilities don’t get in the way. Communicate and set boundaries with the people around you so they understand not to intrude and you can focus on relaxing.\n\nIf that means hiring a babysitter or turning off your phone so you aren’t disturbed, do it.\n\n7. Turn off your devices\n\nIt might seem like watching TV or scrolling through social media helps you decompress, but the blue light from your electronic devices mimics sunlight, which confuses your body's sleep/wake pattern. Once it gets dark out, try relaxation exercises or other activities that don’t require a screen.\n\n8. Set the mood\n\nYour bedroom should be calming after a long day. Put some thought into creating an inviting space conducive to sleep. Dim the lights, get cozy, and turn on soft music or white noise. Humans sleep better at lower temperatures, so set the thermostat between 60 and 67 °F before you go to bed.\n\n9. Reach out\n\nIf, despite better sleep habits, you’re still not getting the amount of rest you need, consider consulting with your healthcare professional. Try talking to your boss or human resources management team about the problem and how a change in workflow could help.\n\nSleep is critical to peak business performance, and if your work is suffering because you aren’t sleeping, your team will likely want to help.\n\nGetting back on track"
