        "text": "Wazzup, homies!\n\nSo this week, I decided to change things up a little. Instead of reviewing zombies again, we will delve into the realm of racing games. For those of you racing game fans out there, you may know and/or have played racers such as Mario Kart, Need for Speed, Forza, and the like. However, when in comes to my personal favorites, it would be Criterion Game’s Burnout Revenge hands-down. The Burnout series takes racing to a new level. As you are racing against your competitors, you must also dodge rush-hour traffic and, if necessary, pull-off some dirty moves, i.e. wrecking your opponents’ rides. To “takedown” the competition, you will need to ram them against corners, trees, railings, smash them against oncoming vehicles, smash same-way traffic into them, land on them via ramp, fishtail them out-of -control, and even detonate your own car if you yourself are taken out. The methods of takedown are limited to your imagination and your strategic driving.\n\nPremise: As mentioned before, anything goes! If you want to win, you must use everything, the traffic, the road, the environment, to you disposal. The singleplayer campaign consists of two main game types: Race and Crash. Race events consist of lapped-races, Road Rage events where your sole objective is to wreck and tally your opponents’ cars until you yourself have crashed too many times, Crashbreaker races where you can detonate your car after being taken down, Burning Laps where you must complete the course before the time limit, and Traffic Check where you must accumulate as much cash as possible by destroying traffic. In Crash events, your goal is to cause the biggest car wreck and rack up as much cash in damages as possible. Each level places you near a certain road/intersection, and you must jump or crash into a strategic spot to ensure as much damage as possible. In some events, you can choose your vehicle, and in others, you have a vehicle pre-selected for you, and your selection ranges from the lighter muscle cars and compacts to reach the target crash-site in an opportune moment to heavier pick-up trucks and vans to smash hard into the heart of the crash-site. To begin, you start your engine via pressing the “X” button at the proper time and launch with a burst of speed. The event concludes when there are no more vehicles to wreck.\n\nMusic and Sound: The racing in this game is fast, aggressive, and loud. Thus, such a soundtrack is needed to represent such chaos. The radio consists of hard rock and heavy metal from artists such as Avenged Sevenfold, Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects, etc. While many of the tracks are censored in order to maintain the game’s E-10 ESRB rating, you will hardly notice the censorship as you will be mostly on your toes trying to win the race. The vroom of the racecars is breath-taking, the shattering of windows, the cracking of glass, and the explosions are awe-inspiring, the burning of rubber is heart-pounding, and the narrators’ flirtatious voice adds sex-appeal to the destruction. Even the sound effects in the games’ menu exhilarate you.\n\nVisuals: Despite its 2005 release on the PS2, a console whose graphics lagged behind in the sixth-generation, BR is a sight to behold. The framerate runs at 60 FPS, the shift of focus when you speed up gives you an adrenaline rush, the skid sparks, jet-engine-like thrusts, and explosions are bright and imposing, and the plethora of terrain, ranging from the Florida Keys, LA, South Dakota, and Detroit in the US to Rome and the Swiss Alps in Europe and Hong Kong and Tokyo in Asia, is variant and lively. However, you will be driving at such door-ripping speed that you won’t even notice your surroundings. Even more impressive, however, is the amount of detail emphasized on the game’s rides. There is little customization offered for your ride aside from choosing your preferred color, a feature that is present in many other racing games such as the Need for Speed and the Midnight Club series. That being said, the details of each car in your collection is so delicate that the need of customization would be deemed unnecessary. The metallic glimmer and shading of the vehicles are dazzling, and the broken windshields, bent metal, and scraped paint serve as your battle scars. Watching your opponents wipeout in the Takedown Cam is very satisfying, albeit distracting at times, and the red tint of Revenge Cam and the red arrow floating above your rival motivates you to avenge yourself for their rudeness. Knowing that this game is published by the big bad EA Games, you’ll find product placements everywhere you look. Even several of BR‘s cars, including my personal favorite, the Black Elite Racer, an advertisement for the not-then-released shooter game Black, the Logitech Racer, the Criterion Racer, and even a Carl’s Jr. truck.\n\nControls: For the most part, the driving operates smoothly. The controls are manageable and simple, save for the speed boost in the Crash Mode, and keep up with the insane pace of the gameplay. You can navigate smoothly, though sometimes you have to rely on your reflexes due to the outrageous speed. Even after you have wrecked, you can still control the direction your car flies to take your enemies down with you. One complaint that I do have, at least with the PS2 version, is a glitch where your competitors land on top of you and, rather than be taken down, you fall through the track and into an infinite void beneath, causing you to respawn at a faraway spot.\n\nReplay Value: This game will keep you busy for a while. The single-player campaign is lengthy, requiring at least 40 hours of gameplay, and you will want to unlock all the trophies and achievements for each terrain, as doing so unlocks new rides for you to play around. I haven’t played online, but this game is certainly fun to play with your buds on the weekend.\n\nEntertainment: This game is the most exciting, fast-paced racer I have ever played. You are always on the edge as you struggle to win such a dangerous race. Even the times you mess up are enjoyable to watch.\n\nConclusion: If you are a fan of racing games, or even if you dismiss this as being “just another racing game”, give this game a try and be amazed. This game is available for the PS2, the original Xbox, and digitally on Xbox 360, though it will be alittle harder to find the former two as Gamestop no longer sells PS2 and retro Xbox games. Unfortunately, this game is no longer active on PS2 Online or the original Xbox Live, but it is still active on Xbox 360’s Live, and this game is still very enjoyable offline."
