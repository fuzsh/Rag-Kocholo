        "text": "Burnout Revenge\n\nDeveloper: Criterion Games\n\nPublisher: Electronic Arts\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 2, Xbox\n\nReleased in JP: October 20, 2005\n\nReleased in US: September 13, 2005\n\nReleased in EU: September 23, 2005\n\nReleased in AU: September 26, 2005\n\nReleased in KR: October 24, 2005\n\nReleased in TW: October 28, 2005\n\nThis game has unused areas.\n\nThis game has unused code.\n\nThis game has a hidden developer message.\n\nThis game has unused modes / minigames.\n\nThis game has unused graphics.\n\nThis game has unused models.\n\nThis game has unused cinematics.\n\nThis game has unused sounds.\n\nThis game has unused text.\n\nThis game has debugging material.\n\nThis game has regional differences.\n\nThis game has revisional differences.\n\nThis game has a prototype article\n\nThis game has a prerelease article\n\nBurnout Revenge is... well, most fans say it's a Burnout 3.5, which sort of makes sense since it's very similar to the previous game. Still, the controls are tighter, the graphics have been cranked up a notch, and it features an entirely new collection of cars. Also, it's one of the few games on the PlayStation 2 to have online multiplayer.\n\nIt was later re-released on the Xbox 360, like many EA games of 2005.\n\nSub-Pages\n\nPrototype Info\n\nPrerelease Info\n\nBurnout 3: Takedown Leftovers\n\nGiven that this game is essentially Burnout 3.5, it's no surprise that some content from that game remains leftover in this game.\n\nEarly HUD Graphics\n\nFile Name: GLOBAL.TXD\\HUD\n\nA leftover leftover! These graphics were used in the pre-E3 builds of Burnout 3.\n\nRed Boost Flames\n\nAs in Burnout 3, Data/vdb.bin allows any playable vehicle to have their boost flame color set to either blue (default) or red. This behavior was used in Burnout 3 exclusively by the Dominator vehicles. No vehicle in this game uses red boost flames, leaving the behavior unused, though it would shortly be reworked for the 360 version to give certain vehicles, such as the 360 Revenge Racer, green boost flames instead of the default blue color.\n\nText\n\nhello world ru paranoid? BURNOUT3 burnout3-ps2-2004\n\nThese strings appear in the game's executable.\n\nIn addition, globalXX.bin, where XX varies by the game's region (US for the USA, EN for the UK etc.), is a carbon copy of the same file from Burnout 3. All strings that apply to both games e.g. save/load dialog, display configuration dialog etc. are used, with all strings that can only apply to Burnout 3, like the song list and list of Signature Takedowns from that game going unused.\n\nDebug Options\n\nTo do:\n\nThe current quickstart method seems to often cause crashes (especially on Xbox), come up with a better way (editing the function where this is loaded from?)\n\nEuropean Xbox name meanings:\n\nEUR-M3 – En,Fr,De\n\nEUR-M6 – Da,Es,Fi,It,Nl,Sv\n\nQuickstart Menu\n\nA debug quickstart menu that lets you load an event with various custom settings for you to choose from. All of the areas use their real life location names, as a leftover from much earlier in development. The 2nd line for the PS2 codes avoids a crash of an address pointer failing to be loaded in time. This may cause unforeseen problems if it's active during normal gameplay!\n\nThe PS2 codes replace the Progressive Scan menu, and the Xbox codes replace the in-game Pause menu.\n\nPlayStation 2 SLES-53506 SLES-53507 SLUS-21242 1049FE4C 00002248\n\n21C10E98 0069A000 1049FECC 000022A8\n\n21C10E98 0069A000 1049FD4C 00002248\n\n21C10C18 0069A000 SLAJ-25066 SLKA-25304 SLPM-66108 1049FDCC 00002258\n\n21C10C98 0069A000 1049FECC 000022A8\n\n21C0EC98 0069A000 10432E04 00003A10\n\n21B98178 0069A000\n\nXbox EUR-M3 EUR-M6 USA, ASIA 003F90D8 0C70 003F9300 0BD0 003F8F04 0D30\n\nWorld Time\n\nA debug display that shows how much time has elapsed in the upper right corner starting from when the event began.

While checkpoints are present in the game, they are invisible. This would have been used if Time Attack had returned from the previous game. They can be brought back, as seen here.\n\nCrown\n\nFile Name: GLOBAL.TXD\\crown\n\nIt's a crown. Probably intended for multiplayer.\n\nCrash Tour\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\b4choiceiconnav\\crashTour.tif\n\nA Crash Tour event button. While Crash Tour was also a singleplayer event earlier in development, it was made multiplayer-only at some point, thus making this icon go unused.\n\nGarage\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\b4choiceiconnav\\garage.tif\n\nA button that would've taken you to the garage. Quite useless, since selecting an event would automatically take you to the garage anyway.\n\nDirt Overlays\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\b4choiceiconnav\\Rank_dirt01.tif; tabDirt.tif\n\nThese textures were used as an overlay for the rank icons and challenge sheet tabs to give them more of a dirty look, and is used in earlier Development builds.\n\nRank Icon Background\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\b4mapnav\\iconBevel.tif\n\nThis icon was used as a background slot where the rank icons would be positioned over, and can also be seen in use in development builds.\n\nMap Marker\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\b4maplight\\roadLight.tif; lensFlare.tif\n\nThese textures were used on the world map to pinpoint where the player would be driving in. The world map got cut from the game, leaving this unused. As above, this can be seen used in earlier builds.\n\nTrack Outline\n\nFile Name: FEMAIN.BIN\\detroit\\Detroit01_L1.tif\n\nNormally the game uses a yellow trailed dot to show the outline of a track, but there's one texture left in that shows the whole outline, along with an early design of Motor City's view from above.\n\nThis more closely resembles to how Burnout 3: Takedown would display tracks.\n\nPlaceholders\n\nInput Text\n\nFile Name: CAFE.BIN\\stdctrl\\inputText.tif\n\nPlaceholder box that says \"Input Text\" what more is there to say. There are more placeholders of this style found in the Demo builds.\n\nUnused Sounds\n\n\"Crashbreaker Unlock Video\"\n\nFile Name: Movies.xwb & MOVIES.RWS\\33\n\nThis is a placeholder audio file for a \"Crashbreaker unlock video\", which is just a text-to-speech voice saying exactly that. This video would likely have played when Crashbreaker events became available. However, such a video does not exist.\n\nUnused Videos\n\nOne of the game's trailers can be found on the disc in two identical files named MULTI and PREVEVNT.\n\nSomething particularly noteworthy is the appearance of a few elements from Burnout 3, including Crash pickups of which all the Cash pickups and the Heartbreaker can be seen. Burnout 3's red and white ramps can also be seen. Some parts of these pickups still exist in the game, as seen here.\n\nPlaceholder Movies\n\nThere are placeholder movies for completing all challenges for a track. However, in the movies the names of the tracks are of their real life locations and there are no \"final build\" movies of this kind.\n\nFilename Track name Unused video Filename Track name Unused video ALL_DT_N Motor City ALL_FL_N Sunshine Keys ALL_HK_N Central Route ALL_LA_N Angel Valley ALL_NP_N Lone Peak ALL_RM_N Eternal City ALL_SW_N White Mountain ALL_TK_N Eastern Bay\n\nEarly/Unused Text\n\nBuying Cars\n\nAccording to these strings, it would appear that you were originally meant to unlock cars by purchasing them instead of completing events and challenges. This can be seen from early mock-up videos when the game was called “Rush Hour”. This was also advertised in a flyer for the game in Burnout 3, mentioning that having a Burnout 3 save when starting Revenge would give you a bonus on in-game cash. This method of unlock was instead used for getting the Dominator Assassin in the PS2/Xbox versions of the game.\n\nString ID String 4C318102 %1 PURCHASED! 90DD1AFD BUY BE952B8F BUY NOW D9F3052A BUY THIS CAR FOR $%1 F2E73BB1 CAR PURCHASED! 6F2B500F YOU NEED TO BUY A %1 CAR TO ENTER THIS EVENT.

Why does this happen? How can smart people take up positions that defy any reasonable logic? Having spent many years working with smart people I’ve catalogued many of the ways this happens, and I have advice on what to do about it. I feel qualified to write this essay as I’m a recovering smart person myself and I’ve defended several very bad ideas. So if nothing else this essay serves as a kind of personal therapy session. However, I fully suspect you’ll get more than just entertainment value (“Look, Scott is stupider than we thought!”) out of what I have to say on this topic.Success at defending bad ideasThe monty python argument sketchI’m not proud to admit that I have a degree in Logic and Computation from Carnegie Mellon University. Majoring in logic is not the kind of thing that makes people want to talk to you at parties, or read your essays. But one thing I did learn after years of studying advanced logic theory is that proficiency in argument can easily be used to overpower others, even when you are dead wrong. If you learn a few tricks of logic and debate, you can refute the obvious, and defend the ridiculous. If the people you’re arguing with aren’t as comfortable in the tactics of argument, or aren’t as arrogant as you are, they may even give in and agree with you. The problem with smart people is that they like to be right and sometimes will defend ideas to the death rather than admit they’re wrong. This is bad. Worse, if they got away with it when they were young (say, because they were smarter than their parents, their friends, and their parent’s friends) they’ve probably built an ego around being right, and will therefore defend their perfect record of invented righteousness to the death. Smart people often fall into the trap of preferring to be right even if it’s based in delusion, or results in them, or their loved ones, becoming miserable. (Somewhere in your town there is a row of graves at the cemetery, called smartypants lane, filled with people who were buried at poorly attended funerals, whose headstones say “Well, at least I was right.”)\n\nUnused Features\n\nTo do:\n\nAdd codes for these.\n\nCheckpoints\n\nThe function to draw these checkpoints still exist, albeit somewhat broken. And they're normally drawn without any texture, making them appear as white squares by default, however this is an easy fix. They only appear right before starting the first lap.\n\nCrash Pickups\n\nThese also have a function to be drawn, and as with the checkpoints above, these normally have no texture assigned to them. They can be given any texture stored in GLOBAL.TXD, however it doesn't have any actual crash pickup textures leftover. There's also another function to draw yellow sparks that would normally be shown when picked up, however these seem to only be visible when the game is paused.\n\nUnused Burning Laps\n\nUsing debug options, set the Game Mode to Burning Lap. Setting to specify a Burning Lap where no location exists, a target time is set for each.\n\nMotor City - Short Forwards Gold: 1:05.00 / Silver: 1:15.00 / Bronze: 1:30.00 Motor City - Long Forwards Gold: 1:35.00 / Silver: 1:50.00 / Bronze: 2:05.00 Eternal City - Short Reverse Gold: 1:20.00 / Silver: 1:35.00 / Bronze: 1:50.00 Central Route - Short Reverse Gold: 0:58.00 / Silver: 1:08.00 / Bronze: 1:18.00 Eastern Bay - Long Reverse Gold: 2:15.00 / Silver: 2:30.00 / Bronze: 2:45.00 Eastern Bay - Lower Link Reverse Gold: 1:22.00 / Silver: 1:35.00 / Bronze: 1:50.00\n\nOddities\n\nSunshine Keys Internal ID\n\nNormally for all tracks the V1 variant is the forward version of the track, and V2 is the reverse version. This is true for all tracks of all the Takedown-era games, except for Sunshine Keys, where V1 is the reverse track, and V2 is the forwards track.\n\nString ID String Label String EA624F27 US_L2_V1 SUNSHINE KEYS R 736B1E9D US_L2_V2 SUNSHINE KEYS F\n\nMissing Multiplayer Crash Junctions\n\nThe Multiplayer Crash gamemodes index all but two Crash events you get to play in the World Tour.\n\nString ID String Label String 78991EB8 US_K1_V1_3H RETURN OF THE SEMI 03C78A8F US_K1_V1_9E JUMP ON THE JAM\n\nBlank EA Trax Album\n\nNormally blank strings would have a single space in them to avoid them displaying \"NO STRING\" or \"NO CHARS\" in-game. The string with the label \"EATraxAlbum1\" (A23F2339) which is used for the 1st EA Trax album was accidentally left fully blank in the PlayStation 2's German localisation. This is not present in any other localisation, nor on the Xbox version.\n\nPlayStation 2 Xbox\n\nRegional Differences\n\nOnline Mode\n\nThe Online option was removed from the Japanese release of Burnout Revenge. This also means 8 of the loading screen strings that start with Burnout Revenge Online, which don't show up in-game anymore, as well as one other loading screen text mentioning the use of Madden NFL 06 for a bonus car which does appear, have their text replaced to simply say バーンアウト リベンジ, which is \"Burnout Revenge\" written in Katakana.\n\nString ID String Label English String Japanese String F1975D46 genBeatGameTip8 Advancing your Revenge Rank\n\nIf you have a Madden NFL 06 save when you start\n\nBurnout Revenge you'll get a head start!\n\nバーンアウト リベンジ C73514B1 onlineTip1 Burnout Revenge Online\n\nGo online and take down Burnout Revenge players\n\nfrom around the world.\n\nバーンアウト リベンジ 5E3C450B onlineTip2 Burnout Revenge Online\n\nPlay online and team up with your\n\nbuddies around the world!\n\nバーンアウト リベンジ 293B759D onlineTip3 Burnout Revenge Online\n\nThe all-new party system allows buddies\n\nto stick together online.\n\nバーンアウト リベンジ B75FE03E onlineTip4 Burnout Revenge Online\n\nPlay online!

Take on the best and\n\ntrash-talk the rest!\n\nバーンアウト リベンジ\n\nEnglish Japanese\n\nDifferent Text\n\nCar Select Menu\n\nThe line that shows the strength of a car's Crashbreaker is different between the North American and European releases. The word \"Colour\" has also been re-spelled as \"Color\" for the American release as games released in Europe usually use British English for said word.\n\nEuropean American\n\nCrash Courses\n\nCrash Junctions are named Crash Intersections in the North American release.\n\nEuropean American\n\nPlatform Differences\n\nDespite being pretty much the same game all around, there are a few very minor differences still spotted between the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions.\n\nLoading Screen\n\nThe initial loading bar is white in the PlayStation 2 release and pink in the Xbox release. The people at Criterion must've had a field day with the loading bar color, because in the pre-release Demo builds they had at least three other colors used for the loading bar.\n\nPlayStation 2 Xbox\n\nDanish Language\n\nThe European Non-English SKU contains Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish for both platforms. But the Xbox version has one additional language - Danish, which is for some reason gone from the PlayStation 2 release. Even stranger, a pre-release PlayStation 2 build just two and a half weeks before the final build still has Danish present and playable.\n\nPlayStation 2 Xbox\n\nCar Select Menu\n\nThe Xbox version only lists one car at a time in the Car Select menu, unlike PlayStation 2, where you can see the name of one car in each direction of the list. Another thing to note is that the Xbox version doesn't have button text in all capital letters.\n\nPlayStation 2 Xbox\n\nWhite Mountain Clouds\n\nThe clouds that are located in White Mountain have a way higher level of intensity on Xbox. This was likely an oversight, since in the later Xbox 360 release, the cloud intensity was reduced back to the amount that's used on PlayStation 2.\n\nPlayStation 2 Xbox"
