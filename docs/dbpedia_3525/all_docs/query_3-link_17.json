        "text": "Burnout Royale is a future racing video game developed by Criterion Games and Catch 22 Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is the seventh installment in the Burnout series and commemorates the series' 20th anniversary. It will be released on November 1st, 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nAs a commemoration for the Burnout series, Burnout Royale features returning content from every Burnout game released from 2001 to 2021, albeit updated to produce a re-energized racing experience. In this regard, the game is akin to Burnout Legends, the only handheld exclusive game in the series, but on a much more greater scale.\n\nCore gameplay for Royale is most similar to Burnout 3: Takedown, Burnout Revenge and to a lesser extent, Burnout Dominator. Like those games, the iconic World Tour game mode serves as the game's main career mode. Additional gameplay mechanics and features that return from past games include: a sense of speed similar to that of Burnout Paradise, Crashbreaker, Impact Time, Aftertouch Takedowns, Signature Takedowns, and the abilities to traffic check, activate Crashbreaker in any race-oriented mode, and perform Burnout Chains.\n\nDespite the vast amount of returning content, the game features some new content as well. This most prominently includes \"Royales\": special versions of certain events that feature up to 15 racers at one time (more than twice the normal amount).\n\nWorld Tour[]\n\nBurnout Royale's World Tour features a total of 225 events spread out across over more than a dozen game modes that are playable across various locations throughout the world. It is the biggest World Tour event to date in a Burnout game, surpassing Burnout Legends' 175 events.\n\nRace - Race up to 6 racers at a time in a series of laps around a track. Races can be 1, 2 or 3 laps in length.\n\nRoyale Race - Similar to regular Race, but with 15 racers at a time.\n\nPursuit - Driving as the pursuit variant of a vehicle, takedown a racer or racers before they finish the race. This event functions similarly to the Pursuit event from Burnout Legends.\n\nSurvival - A new, inverted version of Pursuit where the player must finish the race without being taken down by police a certain amount of times. If they are taken down three times, the player must start the event again.\n\nEliminator - Race where the racer in last place is eliminated after thirty seconds. The final racer remaining is the winner.\n\nRoyale Eliminator - Similar to regular Eliminator, but with 15 racers at a time. In this event, the racer in last place is eliminated after fifteen seconds as opposed to the standard thirty.\n\nRoad Rage - Take down as many racers as possible before the time runs out.\n\nCrash - Cause as much destruction as possible within a confined Crash Junction. This variation of Crash is very similar to Revenge, although the \"Target Car Takedown\" sub-objective is absent.\n\nPreview - Test drive some of the fastest cars in Royale in a Burning Lap-style race against the clock.\n\nGrand Prix - Multi-Race event where the racer with the most GP points after three races is the overall winner.\n\nRoyale Grand Prix - Similar to regular Grand Prix, but with 15 racers at a time.\n\nTraffic Attack - Check traffic to keep a running timer ticking in a boosting craze to beat time targets and earn a high enough total.\n\nCrash FM[]\n\nThe iconic radio station first introduced in Burnout 3: Takedown, Crash FM returns to Royale in two different capacities, featuring all three DJs from the preceding games (Takedown, Revenge/Dominator and Paradise).\n\nDuring non-Crash events and in the World Tour menu, DJ Atomika and an unnamed female announcer (Jules de Jongh, Revenge/Dominator) will alternate talking to the player, giving them tips and providing general commentary. If during events, they will randomly interrupt the Soundtrack in similar fashion to DJ Stryker from Takedown.\n\nCrash events feature Crash News, a cutscene-driven feature and extension of Crash FM that automatically appears after each Crash event is completed. This feature was originally set to appear in Burnout Revenge, but was cut for unknown reasons. In Royale, DJ Stryker is the host of Crash News.\n\nLocations[]\n\nThere are 20 track locations featured in the World Tour, all of which are from previous Burnout games. All of the tracks have forward and reverse layouts. It is worth noting that some of these tracks have multiple configurations and that the bulk of them have Crash Junctions.\n\nTrack Name Mult. Config. Crash Junctions Airport Terminal 3 No Yes Sunrise Valley No Yes 88 Interchange No Yes USA Marathon (Renamed \"Marathon\" In-game) No No Silver Lake No Yes Waterfront No Yes Lakeside Getaway No No Winter City No Yes Riviera No Yes Coastal Dream No No Angel Valley Yes Yes Central Route Yes Yes Eastern Bay Yes Yes Eternal City Yes Yes Sunshine Keys Yes Yes Autobahn No Yes Spiritual City Yes Yes Black Gold Highway No Yes Paradise City Yes Yes Big Surf Island Yes Yes\n\nVehicles[]\n\nThere are a total of 135 vehicles spread across 9 series that can be unlocked in the World Tour. These vehicles return from almost every preceding game in the Burnout series (Burnout 1 is the only game not represented). Each vehicle has an engine sound unique to that vehicle, essentially guaranteeing that the player will never hear the same engine sound twice.\n\nUnless otherwise noted with an \"N/A\", vehicles have pursuit variants that can be unlocked through completion of Pursuit events.\n\n(NOTE: Vehicles are categorized based on their overall performance within the game.)\n\nClassic Series[]\n\nVehicle Name Pursuit Variant Burnout Classic N/A American Classic Classic Interceptor Muscle Type 1 N/A Classic Muscle N/A Euro Classic N/A Custom Compact (Takedown) Pursuit Compact Hunter Calvary N/A Hunter Reliable Custom N/A Hunter Mesquite N/A Carson Fastback Carson Fastback Chaser Montgomery Hyperion Rattler Montgomery Hyperion Heat Seeker Carson-Bennett Grand Marais N/A Hunter Manhattan N/A\n\nFactory Series[]\n\nVehicle Name Pursuit Variant Factory Sports Factory Interceptor Limited ST N/A Modified M-Type ST N/A Custom M-Type ST N/A Modified Compact N/A Compact Type 1 N/A Compact Type 2 N/A Compact Type 3 N/A Factory Muscle Factory Bruiser American Drifter American Speed Cruiser Factory R160 ST N/A Factory M-Type ST N/A Nakamura Ikusa GT Nakamura Ikusa Hunter Nakamura SI-7 N/A Kitano Touge Sport N/A\n\nHeavyweight Series[]\n\nVehicle Name Pursuit Variant 4WD Racer N/A SUV (Point of Impact) N/A Pickup (Point of Impact) N/A Heavy Pick Up N/A Challenge Bus (Revenge) S.W.A.T.

Aggression Boost is the boost system for the racer variant of vehicles and Supercharge Boost is the boost system for the pursuit variants. Both systems have boost bars with a total length of x3.\n\nAggression Boost[]\n\nAggression Boost is carried over in its entirety from Burnout Paradise. Crashing will cause the player to lose a section of their boost bar and taking down rivals will add a section of it. The only difference is that the boost's color has been changed from red-orange to yellow.\n\nSupercharge Boost[]\n\nSupercharge Boost is mostly based on the Dominator Boost from Dominator, allowing the player to perform Burnout Chains once their vehicle's boost bar becomes full and supercharged. However, its additional mechanics makes this version of Dominator Boost stand out. As long as the player is burning Supercharge Boost, their vehicle will go 5-10 MPH faster than their vehicle's racer variant. In addition, their vehicle will rev its engine after each successful Burnout as the boost automatically refills. Lastly, the boost will turn from yellow to a unique white once it becomes supercharged.\n\nCrash Junctions[]\n\nBurnout Royale/Crash Junctions\n\nSignature Takedowns[]\n\nBurnout Royale/Signature Takedowns\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nRoyale features a soundtrack consisting of 50 songs handpicked by LoganC22 from the soundtracks of Takedown, Revenge, Dominator & Paradise that the player can listen to in the menus and while racing. Akin to Dominator, the soundtrack is listed in the \"Options\" menu in alphabetical order, but during gameplay plays on a shuffled basis.\n\n* Theme song\n\nArtist Song Title Album (Original Appears On) ¡Forward, Russia!
