        "text": "60 FPS on Console\n\nRunning at 60 FPS is standard for arcade &amp; PC games, but hardware restrictions of consoles often force developers to aim for lower framerates in order to preserve visual detail or allow greater scale. 3D console games hitting 60 FPS are thus uncommon, though the trend of re-releasing games on newer hardware has technically resulted in more 3D console games hitting 60 FPS.\n\nAchievements\n\nAchievements are extra challenges added into video games that sometimes carry a point value or unlock bonus material, and are sometimes solely for bragging rights.\n\nAftertouch\n\nAftertouch is a technique where the player is able to manipulate the path of an object that they would realistically have no control of, such as a fired bullet or a crashing car.\n\nArcade Driving Physics\n\nAn Arcade-style racer is a game which shoots for a fun and fast-paced experience over trying to simulate real life physics and racing protocol.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, commonly refers to the programmed behaviors of NPCs in a game, whether it's the fact that a soldier takes cover behind a wall in Gears of War, or that townspeople cheer upon your arrival to their village in Fable.\n\nBoost\n\nBoost takes a game to a new level giving players a greater level of speed. This speed opens up new doors to sports games, driving games, and any game that can benefit from the reward of speed.\n\nBot\n\nAI Bots are computer-controlled game characters that substitute for characters that are otherwise typically played by a human, and are most commonly found in multiplayer games.\n\nBullet Time\n\nBullet time is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to slow down time. Depending on the game itself, the player often slows down along with the world around them, however occasionally the player can simply move at normal speed while the game world continues to slow.\n\nBurnout\n\nForced Wheel spin where the brake is applied and the gas pedal is floored, therefore spinning the tires, then releasing the brake for a small boost. Not meant to be done, but a popular showboating technique.\n\nCars With No Drivers\n\nMany games sport magic cars that drive all by themselves. This is most likely done in order to keep a low rating or for other reasons.\n\nCinematic Jump\n\nA concept used in many racing and action games in which your vehicle or character is airborne and shot at an awesome angle, often in slow-mo.\n\nCustom Soundtrack\n\nA gameplay feature that offers players the option to listen to their own music instead of the game's original soundtrack. This allows for a more personalized listening experience.\n\nDamage Model\n\nDamage modelling is used to show damage that has been inflicted. Damage can be modelled on game object so long as the game's engine will allow for it\n\nDead Multiplayer\n\nOver time, it's common for publishers to stop supporting the online components of old or unpopular games. In addition to saving money, this also serves to boost sales of newer games in the same series or genre.\n\nDNAS\n\nDNAS was Sony's solution to all of the online cheating on PS2 games. It was also introduced as a means to discourage and prevent illegal copies of games to be played online.\n\nDolby Digital\n\nDolby Digital is an audio compression technology codec first used in movie theaters. It's now commonly used in many modern day audio/video media formats, including video games.\n\nDownloadable Content\n\nDownloadable Content adds new features and content to already-distributed video games via the Internet. Examples include new maps for FPS games, new songs for rhythm games, and new cars for racing games.\n\nDrafting\n\nDrafting is the term in motorsports for following a car closely. The result of drafting makes for less air resistance, faster speeds, and better fuel mileage.\n\nDrift Jumping\n\nDrift jumping has been a secret staple of the third and fourth Burnout games. To be able to compete with the best of the best, players must be able to drift right before hitting a jump to gain a massive speed boost.\n\nDrifting\n\nDrifting is a technique used in motorsports that involves intentionally over-steering the car to create a slide. This is done both as a competitive and exhibitive technique."
