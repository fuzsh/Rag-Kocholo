        "text": "The fact the gun can merge onto his arm is what sells Deluxe Ratchet to me. Connectivity to Lockdown is also nice, plus in this case Lockdown looks good even without the EMP. As an interesting aside, I noticed the EMP plugs into the arm opposite to that of where it went on the Animated toys (i.e. the EMP went on Ani. Lockdown's hook component while Movie Lockdown has the hole/engine on the arm with the hand instead), although this may be because Movie Ratchet only ever used the gun the EMP looks like on his right arm.\n\nIt's more of an homage to the EMP from Animated in that both Lockdown and Ratchet could use it there, too, complete with the holes where the EMP plugs into on the movie toys being a very similar keyhole like shape ala Ani. Ratchet's war wound. The fact movie Lockdown's otherwise-useless engine block also goes into that hole on his arm may homage the fact the original Lockdown's engine block WAS the EMP (but advertised as an \"engine blaster\").\n\nAlthough this time, Ratchet gets the EMP from the start, a sort of reversal from Animated where Lockdown had the EMP.\n\nWell, the vehicle mode is nowhere near as accurate as the Voyager, plus the paint apps are very lacking in robot mode. Also, I know he uses the gun in the desert scene in ROTF, but I don't remember him using it at all in the first film, but this is for ROTF, and so he's got the much-better gun than that little Axe.\n\nI got him today and I quite like him though I can nitpick all day about how his light-piping is neutered, how his fifth wheel and shoulders don't plug anywhere, his empty chest, and the inability to turn his hands. However the robot form is a nice representation of his robot mode, including the pieces that open up when you plug in his arm cannon and the lights on his shoulders, and his head has a McCoyish scowl. Some have complained he isn't in scale with deluxe Ironhide but if you give stooping legs like the VG model then they're roughly the same height. I'm also glad the vehicle mode kibble doesn't prevent him from rolling around."
