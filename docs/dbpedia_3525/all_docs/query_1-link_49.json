        "text": "6 0 2\n\nLet me give you some history about my time during the Burnout series. As a big fan of Burnout, I wasn't complaining about this title when it was announced. It looked like it had so much potential to be like a new Burnout game, judging by the trailers. Burnout, in my personal opinion, was significantly better than Need for Speed. And throughout the series, we were getting new gameplay mechanics, such as getting air (Burnout 2: Point of Impact), taking down other drivers (Burnout 3: Takedown), getting revenge and checking traffic (Burnout Revenge), seeing how skilled you are in Maniac mode (Burnout Dominator), and racing in an open world environment (Burnout Paradise). And although Need for Speed had many more games, Burnout still stood as the superior series to me. I didn't get a chance to play Burnout CRASH!, so sorry if I couldn't share my opinion on that game.\n\nThe vehicles for the series were very creative, and pretty sweet looking, for street racing games. We had the Saloon GT from the first Burnout, the Custom Coupe from Burnout 2, the Modified/Dominator Super from Burnout 3, the Revenge Racer from Burnout Revenge, the American Classic from Burnout Dominator, and the Carson & Bennet Thunder Custom/Shadow in Burnout Paradise.\n\nBut Burnout didn't get the very good treatment Need for Speed had. What do I mean by that? Well, Burnout was a great game series, no doubt. But unlike Need for Speed, it didn't get nearly as many games, like I mentioned above. Only 8 Burnout games were made, not including the repackaged Anthology, which included the PS2 versions of Takedown, Revenge, and Dominator, nor The Ultimate Box, which was a PC-exclusive refurbish of Paradise. In fact, Need For Speed was around a little while before Burnout came to be.\n\nParadise was the final Burnout game before the series was temporarily killed off. Burnout Revenge on the Xbox 360 had more content than the other two versions, such as free DLC/Kiosk Cars and 10 new exclusive crash junctions. The servers for Revenge were first shut down in April 2012, and the 360 version's servers were turned back on three weeks later while the PS2 and classic Xbox's servers remained closed. Then after 5 and a half years, Burnout Revenge's Xbox 360 servers were shut down again, specifically on October 24th, 2017 seemingly for good this time. And then shortly afterwards, the game was Backwards Compatible, which really made no sense as to why Criterion, the creators of Burnout, made such a move after the fact they shut the servers down.\n\nBefore they made the game BC, we got a trailer for another Burnout game - Burnout Paradise Remastered, which is simply a graphical update to the original Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, and made to be played on the Xbox One, PS4, and PC versions. However, it was more glitchier in Online Freeburn. As a hardcore fan, I wasn't complaining. Well, other than the connectivity giving itself out sometimes, which was always annoying, especially during Freeburn Challenges.\n\nRoughly a year after the release of Remastered (and no, a remaster of an already remastered Burnout Revenge that came out in 2006 for the Xbox 360 wouldn't work, by the way. A lot of people are wishing we'd get that, but it won't happen, believe me), we got a trailer for an upcoming game that wasn't called Burnout, but made by former members of Criterion, hence why in the intro of that trailer, \"From the creators of BURNOUT.\"\n\nDangerous Driving was on it's way to being the next Burnout 3. Burnout 3 was pretty much the best selling Burnout game in the series. What, did I not mention that before? It's true, actually. Dangerous Driving was made by a company in the UK called, Three Fields Entertainment. These guys were first formed in 2014, and are known for making Dangerous Golf, and the two Danger Zone games. In fact, every game they made had the word, 'Danger' in there, which I thought was kind of stupid, but funny simultaneously.\n\nAnd while I enjoyed watching the trailers, I was thinking to myself, 'Well, if they're gonna make something based on an existing Burnout game, it's gotta have some level of entertainment, right?' And while the trailer had me interested for the game, the same could not be said for the gameplay itself. The game was released on April 9th, 2019, but I didn't have the opportunity to get it due to Real Life getting in the way (I mean, that's to be expected). So I decided to get it near the end of the year, with the online Multiplayer updates.\n\nWhen I got the game, though... This game wasn't really much like a Burnout game. I mean, it's still like a Burnout game, but it's just not Burnout enough. It honestly feels like a fanboy's parodied version of Burnout 3. And now, this where I'm gonna be discussing seven areas of the game, with my own personal rating for each.\n\nPresentation: D\n\nOnly the Single Player Career and online Multiplayer. That's really it. There's no Single Event, nor split-screen. Why can't the offline have some fun, too? Burnout 3 had that. Heck, Revenge had a World Tour, but it was executed significantly better. On top of that, only four cars per series. Why aren't there more? Or did they run out of ideas to make more of them? The Platinum Medals are decent additions to the events if you want to aim higher, but they really don't do anything. No Crash mode on-disc (hint: Danger Zone). The paint jobs, while unique looking for the polishing and abundant, consist of plain colors and stripes. No racing vinyls like flames, checkered flags, scratches, or any others. There are no tracks that take place in metro cities and suburbs. I mean, if they had those in the game, that would be more like dangerous driving to me.\n\nGameplay: D\n\nA lot like Burnout 3, but severely degraded. The steering is too mobile for it to resemble Burnout 3's handling mechanics, you can literally steer through nearly every corner, it makes drifting look kinda pointless. Some bugs like rebounding to the opposite direction of the track by just slamming into other drivers and hitting invisible barriers needs to be fixed. I mean, that's another thing with this game: the glitch presence. It makes the game behave in ways you don't want it to, resulting in wrecking the fun of the game. Then, there's the Persistent Wrecks feature, where if you take down rivals on the first lap, it becomes more hazardous for you to get into Nervous Wrecks on subsequent laps. This gets very annoying, especially in the higher vehicle classes in the Career. There's another thing about this game, too: the amount of FPS depending on which console model you're playing on. Personally, I find it insulting that only Xbox One X owners can run the game at 60fps, while the base consoles run it at 30fps. And that does NOT include the PC version! Also, did I mention that the respawn points can be crap at times? I had a few times where I wrecked, and I would spawn into another traffic vehicle and wreck before I even regain control of my vehicle. Yeah, nice system, Three Fields... This is a game that was made in 8 months, and it certainly does feel like it's in beta form. It clearly needed much more time in the QA to patch up the common bugs this game has.\n\nGraphics: A\n\nHonestly, being a 2019 game, the graphics look wicked cool! Easily the game's best point, in my eyes. The vehicles look very detailed, the tracks look super awesome to drive through (especially the Marathon variations with the starry skies. Like, holy crap, those are GORGEOUS!!). You drive through locations such as a beach, a desert, woodlands, grasslands, mountains, etc. Though the sun shining in the sky and reflecting off the track's concrete terrain can be annoying and throw you off at times. The vehicles are based on actual models, though slightly alterated - the Supercars resemble a Ferrari LaFerrari, Hypercars resemble an Audi R8, the Coupes resemble a Jaguar F-Type, and so on. They could be very well driven at today's standards. My only nitpicks about the graphics are that the boost flames honestly look like LED lights poking out the exhaust pipes. Couldn't we have more natural designs, like ACTUAL flames? The explosions during crashes aren't very enticing to look at, either. Not to mention the wrecking details are so basic and bland to look at, that they don't even LOOK like they're wrecks, minus the wheels breaking off.\n\nDifficulty: C\n\nThe rubberband AI is complete insanity, especially on the higher classes. They can keep up with you no matter how well you do (except in a few Face-Offs, but still). You make one big mistake, and they'll get some sort of big lead, that you'll literally have to do everything in your power to take back the lead. Tap one traffic vehicle, no matter how fast or slow you're going, and you automatically crash. The Burnout games never allowed this at all. The difficulty of the game spikes often as you progress in the World Tour, which isn't fun. Survival mode is the worst mode in the game. This, combined with the fact that you can crash super easily, with traffic often being too close to the guardrails at times can easily piss you off for reasons that are complete bull. Not to mention, you BOUNCE off the guardrails every time you attempt to stay away from the traffic, and it's irritating. Difficulty needs to be more tuned to make this game more fair and fun to play.\n\nSound & Music: D\n\nPlaying with no music gets very boring unless you have a Spotify account with Premium and link it to this game, which is a really dumb feature if you don't have one. Otherwise, it's okay. But in all honesty, they really should've put some licensed music for the game to begin with, had it not for their low budget. Plus, you can play music with something else like a computer or MP3 player. Rebel Tattoo plays on the title screen and the menus, and it's the only song in the game. Listening to it every time you boot up the game gets old. Quick. So that gets a lot of hate from me. The engine sounds are the same for all cars except the Formula DD class. I just wish there were more engine sounds in the game in general. You know, just to fit the vehicles more.\n\nNostalgia Factor: B\n\nIt tries to do a take on Burnout 3, and it succeeds for the most part. I mean, if you're a fan of Burnout 3, then you'll recognize so much with Dangerous Driving. Yes, there are a few features that WEREN'T in Burnout 3, such as aerial control like Burnout Revenge, Aerial Takedowns, and Junkyard Takedowns, which is to take down a rival into a persistent wreck. It has Boost Starts, and the risks you take are a lot like Burnout 3. So yeah, you will feel right at home when you play this.\n\nReplay Value: D\n\nThere's like, very little replay value. You have the Career mode, which is the only single player mode you can choose, and then there's the online multiplayer, which is the only remotely entertaining part of the game left. I mean, it's there if you want to play with your friends, or you have nothing else to do. And then there's really not much else. Well, there's the online Leaderboards for the Tour, which I guess you can do to improve your scores if you're into that kind of stuff, but that's it. Not much else to do. Gee, I wonder why that is! Not to mention that despite this game being a year old... almost nobody is playing this online, and that is sad. I used to be a big online racer for Burnout Revenge with my friends, and Dangerous Driving screws that up.\n\nAchievements: D\n\nBasically, the achievements are where you complete all events in a series, unlock the Prototype cars, get plenty of mileage in each car (there's even one that requires you to get 1000 miles in any car, which is a bit time consuming), and that's really it. The difficulty in getting 1K for this, however... you're gonna be pulling your hair out after wrecking so many times in the late game.\n\nVerdict\n\nDangerous Driving was quite a letdown, alright. With the slight lack of Presentation, the Gameplay being dull, the Sound & Music being the worst feature of the game, and the tough Difficulty, I wanted to give this game a 3, maybe 3.5 for it trying to be a faithful recreation to Burnout (Burnout 3, more specifically). BUT! The fact that Three Fields Entertainment tried way too hard in making this a successor to Burnout and didn't have time to leave this game in the QA for bug fixes along with numerous other reasons, and the $40 price tag... which should've been $30, $25 at the very least... I'm dropping this to a 2.5 out of 5.\n\nRecommendation\n\nIf you want to experience an arcade Burnout game in 2020, then stay away from this game until the price drops/it goes on sale, or just don't get it at all. However, it's not a 'pass', either. If you're a Burnout-aholic and want to re-live the days of when Burnout 3 was released, then I'm gonna say it again: wait until this game goes on sale, or when the price drops, because it feels like a downgraded version of the game, with less content, common glitches/bugs, lack of split-screen, and only the Single Player Career being the only offline mode of the game. Good luck trying to race with other people online, since it's nearly dead unless you have friends who play the game. If you're looking for a game that can capture the thrill and fun of street racing, having a blast with your friends, doesn't have nearly as many flaws as this game does, this is a game you can skip out on, and better off getting Burnout Paradise Remastered.\n\n2.5"
