        "text": "Criterion's latest addition to its fast-as-hell racing franchise is set to hit stores sooner than our Formula 1 racer can make it to the finish line. Though it saddens us to have to put down the game in order to write about it, you can take joy in our sadness as you learn basically everything there is to know about Burnout Revenge.\n\nOne thing that's become very evident to us through having seen multiple builds of the game since around E3 is how iterative Criterion is with its design. Fundamental ways to how things work have changed in every build we've seen of Burnout Revenge since May, and things have even changed from the demo disc released just a few weeks ago. The basic workings of the gameplay mechanics are fundamentally the same of course, but the game's progression via earning points towards the Revenge Meter, Crash mode, checking traffic (to some extent) and more have at least been tweaked in some way multiple times over the past three-plus months.\n\nHaving said that, while we'll probably see a few minor tweaks here or there before the game hits shelves in the middle of next month, the version of the game we've been burning through is a near-final build and contains everything that the game has to offer.\n\nProgression\n\nThe first major, noticeable overhaul made to the Burnout series is the singeplayer progression. The basic idea is still the same in that you always have multiple options of different race types to partake in to advance at any one time, essentially allowing you to skip the stuff you're not so great at or just don't like (for shame), but the overall availability of everything is dictated by the Revenge Meter.\n\nThe Revenge Meter is broken up into ten categories, with the lowest and first rank being Harmless. A series of race areas are available in each Revenge Rank, and each area has its own subset of race types. So for example, the Harmless ranking contains Sunshine Keys, Motor City, Angel Valley and Lone Peak areas along with a Preview Event. Each one of the areas contains at least one event, be it Crash, Road Rage or what have you. If an area has more than one event (as most do) you may need to place in an open event to unlock others, similar to how Burnout 3 worked.\n\nProgression up the Revenge Meter is earned by gaining stars in each event. Up to four stars are earned for your driving prowess while the fifth and final star is earned by a Gold ranking. You begin each event with an OK rating (one star) and through aggressive driving techniques, like drifting, checking traffic, takedowns, extended boost periods and so forth, you'll work up to the Good, Great and then Awesome ratings, or two, three and four stars respectively. Your rank dictates your final star count with Gold giving you an additional star, Silver essentially being a wash, and a Bronze medal means a star is revoked. Non-placement means that any star rating you've earned doesn't count. So to score a Perfect rating on an event, you'll need to drive aggressively enough to earn an Awesome rating while also finishing first.\n\nPrevious Revenge Ranks stay open as you progress through the game, meaning that you can go back and complete any event you've skipped over later on. As was the case in Burnout 3, you don't need to finish every event in order to continue your progression through the game. We managed to reach the highest ranking, Elite, after completing somewhere around 115 of the 169 available events with something like 95 Perfect ratings within those.\n\nChallenge Sheets and Takedown Books\n\nOne final thing that's changed about the way you progress through the game, and unlock vehicles to be more specific, is that Burnout Revenge has individualized Challenge Sheets and Takedown Book goals for each area rather than for the entire game, as was the case in Burnout 3.\n\nEach area of the game has both its down Challenge Sheet and Takedown Book. The Takedown Book is essentially a miniaturized version of the Signature Takedown list from the last game, the main difference being that you need to snag three Signature Takedowns to finish each Takedown Book rather than an entire set throughout the game, as was the case in Burnout 3.\n\nThe Challenge Sheet is also similar to the goal checklist in Burnout 3, only it's individual and more specific to the area it applies to. Each Challenge Sheet has eight goals to complete, like finishing a race without crashing, nailing two Revenge Takedowns in a single race or obtaining a high score at a Crash Junction. These goals are event-dependent but they aren't tied to a specific race or crash junction. So for example, if one of the goals is to score $5,000,000 at a Crash junction, you can do that at any junction in the current area. As well, if one of the goals requires that you score two Vertical Takedowns in a race, you can complete that challenge at any race in the area.\n\nEach time you finish off a Challenge Sheet you'll unlock a new car. Which leads us to...\n\nVehicles\n\nOne of the complaints about Burnout 3: Takedown was that many of the cars were too similar. That's changed a bit this time around, though with the sheer number of cars in the game -- 78 total -- there's still plenty of similarity in their ratings. But again, their appearance is more varied than before.\n\nThe look of the vehicles is much more akin to those in Burnout 2: Point of Impact than the cars in B3. While the Burnout 3 vehicle set was essentially renamed copies of real-world vehicles, the cars in Burnout Revenge are more original in nature. You'll find cars so replete with intakes, spoilers and fins that they would make a Ferrari Enzo seem plain by comparison. You'll still find a fair share of off-the-wall vehicles as well, like a meals-on-wheels van, a Madden truck (if you have a Madden 06 save when you start the game) and more, but most of the vehicles are designed to look like speed demons.\n\nThe vehicle set is no longer broken up into categories like they were in Burnout 3. Instead, all of the cars in the game are listed in one long string of vehicles, one after the other. The car list seems a little more cohesive this way, even though the cars are indeed more varied, though when you have the opportunity to choose from a long selection of vehicles it can take a while to nail down the ride you want.\n\nEach car has three ratings: Crashbreaker Force, Weight and Boost Speed. Crashbreaker Force obviously applies to how destructive its Crashbreaker is and is ranked on a scale of one to ten; Boost Speed is rather self-explanatory as well. Weight ranges from very light to very heavy and applies to how much inertia the car carries, how maneuverable it is with Aftertouch and how much wind affects its movement while airborne (we'll get to that a little bit later). In some fashion a vehicle's weight rating also gives a clue as to how well it handles, but its handling and acceleration are something you'll generally need to figure out by simply taking the car around the track a few times.\n\nCourses\n\nThough we were a bit skeptical early on as to Burnout Revenge's overall look as the early tracks we'd seen were very gritty and monochromatic in look, something like EA's Need for Speed Underground, that happily is not the case. In reality, each course has been given its own look and feel, making the tracks stand out more yet while (mostly) retaining Burnout's bright and colorful feel. Granted, some courses do feature a very gritty atmosphere and are stylized as such, but only to their general benefit.\n\nMotor City, the track previously known as Detroit (all of the courses have made up names again), has been the most heavily-shown track so far and it does indeed have a very brown/yellow gritty feel, but tracks like Sunshine Keys and Lone Peak have the classic Burnout look and feel that we all know and love. Sunshine Keys is very bright; so bright in fact that the sun reflects off of the track in a blinding manner, making it difficult to pick out traffic, barriers and other obstacles in the distance. Lone Peak is very wooded in nature, bringing up thoughts of Yosemite National Park.\n\nCriterion made two big design changes to the game's track designs this time around. Firstly, each course contains multiple shortcuts and alternate routes. Every shortcut is highlighted by two blue lights on either side of its opening, helping Burners make out quicker passages while traveling at a blurring 200mph.\n\nWhile this may seem like it would make it a little too easy to get an edge on the competition, the alternate routes aren't meant to be hidden. Rather, they're meant to be risky. Some require exacting precision to enter without wrecking, some are littered with numerous poles and obstacles along the way, and some basically drop racers off into a wall if they aren't careful. Indeed, each time you take a shortcut it's less a matter of having known where the shortcut is, but rather a case of having decided to take a sometimes major risk in order to gain a few seconds.\n\nFor example, one shortcut in the game places you on a narrow raceway without guard rails on either side; one misstep leads you to the bottom of a canyon. Another shortcut starts wide but suddenly narrows, leaving room for only one battling car to make it through safely. On Eastern Bay, the Tokyo-esque level, some alternate routes lead you straight into a forking road to other alternate routes. Sounds good, but the problem is that the center of the fork is a solid wall and you're heading straight into at 200mph+. Indeed, the shortcuts will knock a few seconds off your lap time, but they'll cost you more if you're not careful.\n\nThat brings us to Criterion's second design goal: to make the tracks more like battlegrounds than any of the previous games. While Burnout 3 introduced Takedowns and let you battle it out with opposing vehicles, slamming them into side rails and knocking them out of the race for a few seconds, Burnout Revenge introduces all sorts of short alleyways, poles, randomly placed stationary vehicles and all sorts of other obstacles that you and your rivals can essentially use as weapons.\n\nThe result is that you not only need to place yourself on the track at the fastest point at any given time, but also the safest. Rival cars seem to know exactly where the choke points are, and they'll use them at any chance they get. The tracks are much more dangerous than ever before, but their hectic nature can make them more chaotically fun.\n\nRacing Modes\n\nMany of the racing modes are essentially the same in practice as they were in Burnout 3, at least until you get the higher Revenge Ranks. Around the time you get to the fifth or sixth level, Crashbreaker events start appearing. These events work exactly the same as the regular events (win a race, take out opponents in Road Rage), except that your Crashbreaker is armed the whole time.\n\nAny time you're taken out you're able to fire off your Crashbreaker and take out nearby opponents. The amount of boost you currently have equals the amount of damage your Crashbreaker will inflict, or more accurately, the radius of the explosion. The Crashbreaker Force rating of your vehicle comes in play here as well, so while one car may be a smidge faster down the line and better off for quicker lap times, a car with a higher Crashbreaker Force rating will essentially have a better defensive mechanism; taking out four rival cars simultaneously after you've wrecked is simply satisfying as hell and helps keep you in the running. The risk/reward factor to this is that if you use your Crashbreaker and fail to take out any cars, you'll lose all of your accumulated boost. Take someone out though and you'll be right back in the race at full speed.\n\nThough the standard Race, Road Rage, Burning Lap and Preview events are basically unchanged from Burnout 3 (aside from the Crashbreaker element later in the game), Eliminator has gotten a tad bit of an overhaul, and for the better we say. Rather than knocking off the last place opponent after each lap, whichever car is in last place is now eliminated every 30 seconds. This not only makes the event faster, but more hectic at well. Crash with 25 seconds left before an elimination and you're fine, but crash with five seconds left and you're probably screwed.\n\nThe new mode this time around is Traffic Attack. Practically the only thing that hasn't changed since E3, Traffic Attack has you racing around a track, checking traffic to earn points and time. Your starting time decreases the further you are into the game, but the end result is the same: once you're under 20 seconds, any vehicle you take out will add time back to your ticker, up to a maximum of 20 seconds. While you can't directly take out a bus or big rig, hurling another car at one will earn you a Trick Shot and nab you multiple more points and time than any of the vehicles you can take out on your own.\n\nCrash\n\nTo the joy of practically everyone, Crash mode no longer features any icons. There are no longer those pesky x2 and x4 score multipliers that were the target of every junction last time out, nor are there coins for extra money, speed boost icons nor automatic Crashbreakers. While the lack of auto-Crashbreakers is a little saddening (boy though were fun), the lack of the other icons makes for a more dynamic and less target-oriented experience.\n\nIn this way Crash is a little more like Burnout 2 than the third game. The lack of icons is about the only thing that connects the two modes, however. You still have access to your Crashbreaker, but arming it is no longer tied to crashing a requisite number of cars. Instead, as vehicles wreck your boost meter begins filling up; the bigger each wreck, the more your meter is filled. Once your boost meter is filled, your Crashbreaker is armed and ticking.\n\nUnlike Burnout 3 where you could hold on to your singular Crashbreaker until the most strategic time in the crash, as soon as it's armed your Crashbreaker has but a maximum of five seconds to detonate. Once armed, you need to mash the Crashbreaker button in order to build up its intensity. The Crashbreaker will blow either once you reach 100% intensity or five seconds; whichever comes first. The higher a vehicle's Crashbreaker Force, the harder it will be to get it to 100%, but the bigger and more devastating the explosion will be should you max it out.\n\nThe cool part about this is that since you're building up your boost meter in order to earn a Crashbreaker, you can earn and set off more than one per turn. You'll need to as well since the way multipliers work has changed. In Burnout 2 and 3, the numbers of cars that crashed, regardless of how hard, represented your multiplier. In Burnout Revenge, only the cars that explode act as multipliers. Some cars will be traveling fast enough that they'll explode on their own at impact, but others that slam on their brakes early may only wind up in a minor fender-bender and won't earn you an extra multiplier.\n\nAnother big change to the way Crash works in Burnout Revenge is that you now start with a boost bar, similar to a golf meter in various golf games. It works on a three-press system; the first press starts the meter, the second sets your speed and the third sets your accuracy. If you overshoot the second part for speed, your engine will blow and immediately end your run. The accuracy part isn't quite as unforgiving. Miss it bit a little bit and you won't get a full-speed start, but miss it by a lot and you'll stall and even take off at odd angles.\n\nThe junctions are quite a bit more varied than the last Burnout outing. Most every Crash junction in the game is multi-tiered and feature multiple areas of crash interest. The only way to max out your score is to cause chaos at each intersection by checking vehicles into those areas and hope a nice chain reaction starts.\n\nRamps are also much more common than they've been in the past. The catch is that wind now affects your car's trajectory. Before each run you'll notice a wind flag in the lower-right corner of the screen. The lighter your vehicle and the stronger the wind, the more you'll be carried off-course when you launch off a ramp. You can of course fight against the wind, but in some of the most extreme cases you'll need to take off at angle leading into the wind in order to not be blown entirely off-course. While heavier cars will be less affected by wind, they may not be light enough to make a given jump; car selection is more important than it was the last time out.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nSingle-system multiplayer has always been very good in the Burnout games and Burnout Revenge is no exception. Still available are Race and Road Rage split-screen modes for two players, both of which work exactly the same as in Burnout 3. Traffic Attack allows for a split-screen version of the singleplayer mode, except that you're unable to add on time at any point. 99 seconds is all you'll get there, so even the first ten seconds are highly important.\n\nMultiplayer Crash modes include Crash Battle, the simultaneous versus mode introduced in Burnout 3, Crash Party, the multiplayer version of the standard Crash mode for up to six players, as well as the new Crash Tour.\n\nCrash Tour essentially works like a round of golf. Each Crash junction has a par and a target dollar amount. You repeat the same junction, adding to your total amount earned for that junction only, until you've reached the target amount. The number of tries you take is essentially the amount of strokes you take.\n\nFor example, a par 4 course may have a target amount of $15 million. If you get $4 million on your first try, $7 million on your second and $6 million on your third, you took three \"strokes\" in order to finish the \"hole\", or in other words, scored a birdie. You can play up to nine junctions, or \"holes\", this way, though with up to six players this can obviously take quite a while. It's quite good fun though.\n\nOnline and More to Come\n\nThe only thing we have left to cover with Burnout Revenge is its online play. Sadly, that's for another day. Don't be sad though; know that it does exist and that we'll be back to tell you all about it quite soon.\n\nBurnout Revenge is set to ship to retailers on September 13th, just under one month from now. It'll be in your hands before you know it, but before even then we'll have our online coverage and review for your reading pleasure. Or torture, depending on how bad you want this game."
