        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nJredor13\n\n70%Emulated\n\n7h Played\n\nThe last time I've fully played an arcade-like racing game was back in 2014 with Need for Speed: Rivals, and I thought it was good, at least from what I remember. My standards to this genre are very low, and there are other racing games I'm currently playing like NFS Underground and Midnight Club 2. But one racing game I would say I was enjoying more, is Burnout 3. This is the first Burnout game I've played, as I wasn't interested in 1 or 2, and thought this game looked cool to me from what I've heard and seen so I decided to try it out.\n\nIt was nice, and I got plenty of enjoyment out of it. To start things off, Burnout has a mechanic that stands out from other racing games (At least what I know), and that is taking down other drivers. Watching other cars crash as you slam into them into walls or traffic is a satisfying feeling. That's what kept me engaged more as opposed to other racing games where a crash meant it was game over and you had to restart the race. Now in Burnout's case, unless you're in the final lap near the end, then you have a chance to catch up thanks to how fast it feels with boosting. The controls handle smoothly, and even with a car that weighs more, I found drifting to be an easier experience.\n\nThe risk and reward system is neat mechanic that encourages you to go for stuff like driving on the opposite road as you dodge incoming traffic, as you'll need whatever boost you can to speed up and win the race. The cars are nice, and I like that their divided into classes, giving you time to experiment certain vehicles and try them out. It becomes even more rewarding when unlocking certain vehicles or even the next class after Grand Prix's. The racing modes are fun with road rage being a personal favorite of mine, as I love the feeling of crashing into other vehicles. Crash mode is nice as well, but funnily enough, I didn't play a lot of it as I preferred racing on the road more.\n\nI didn't have much of a problem with rubberbanding AI here, primarily because it's game that has an emphasis on speed and takedown. If the driver catches up, I just simply crash them and keep going. Besides, for this type of game, races can feel easy, so it at least stuff like this keeps me entertained on the road. I would feel really bored if I just kept being 1st place without anyone catching up.\n\nI'm not too fond of pop-punk music, but the tracks work well with this game. It gives me a sense of nostalgia for something I didn't listen to as a kid. I will say, driving at high-speed while listening to \"Make a Sound\" felt so damn good, I couldn't help but only keep that song on the radio.\n\nNow onto some problems I had, and I suppose it would have to be the race tracks. They're nice to look around while driving for a couple of hours, but a few hours later and it gets really tiring driving the same track over and over again from different modes. No shortcuts to help spice it up, even the reverse ones weren't enough to keep me interested. I was getting tired of the other game modes around 7 hours in, and I didn't even bother finishing everything as I just went for Grand Prix's. Personally, I felt like this game was a bit excessive with the amount of races to finish gold to end it, and could've toned some down, or at least more tracks or game modes to keep it refreshing.\n\nThen there's the F1 car races, and man, those were the reason I decided to stop playing and end it off on the final Grand Prix. Terrible handling, bound to spinout everytime, and the slightest touch against a wall on accident causes a crash.\n\nNext while, I love watching cars crash with the takedown cam, sometimes it can be unexpected that it throws me off. An example would be that I drive past a vehicle, skidding them, and as I'm ahead of them and making a turn, the camera flashes to the vehicle crashing that I didn't know about, which leads me to crashing into another vehicle. I've learned to keep my reflexes in check, but this can be distracting at times to deal with, costing you the race.\n\nOverall, while I'm not a huge racing fan, I thought it was good game. If you're tired of being hit by cars and spinning out and having to restart the entire race, and want to takeout some frustration against them? Then this might be for you.\n\n95%No Platform Specified\n\nBurnout 3 is astonishing. It's one of the best arcade racers I've ever touched, and I'm a fan of everything from Rallisport to Need for Speed to Extreme-G. I've been a fan of Burnout since the beginning, pretty much, but I've always seen its potential. Well, Burnout 3 met that potential and brought something new to the table at the same time. The sense of speed, which was already quick in previous iterations, is just completely insane now. It rivals even F-Zero GX -- either of them will scramble your brainwaves when you hit top-speeds. Aftertouch is an incredible mechanic that expands the horizons and allows for an almost entirely new mode of play outside of racing.\n\nIt just feels right. Initially, I had serious problems with how forgiving running into walls or traffic could be (especially compared to the first two games), but once I got into it I could see the balance of crashes, burning out, and driving smartly. I mean, sure, I still think it's too easy for the hardcore gamer -- you can get bronzes and silvers without blinking, and usually golds too. But, it's just not a traditional racing game in any way.\n\nI was also really pleased with the expansion of the statistics page, which shows you everything you've accomplished so far and saves a wide range of race times and top feats. Drifting, for example, I always wanted to brag about but I never had proof of my feats in Burnout 2. In Burnout 3, I can show off not only how far my longest drive but the game tells me what track and car I was driving. Replay value is also really expanded with all the extras. You can spend time beating these old records, but you'll probably be busier trying to find the signature takedown in each level, earn crash headlines, or trophies. You even get some exclusive online rewards.\n\nIn the end, I have minor complaints, but Burnout 3 exceeds in so many other areas I simply can't deny my love for it. Pick up the game for yourself, and I'm positive you will feel the same way. Don't make the mistake of thinking Need for Speed Underground 2 or even Gran Turismo 4 (a completely different kind of racer) is a better buy. Self-respecting gamers will add this to their collections -- permanently."
