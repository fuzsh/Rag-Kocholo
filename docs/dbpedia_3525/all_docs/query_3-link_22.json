        "text": "Playstation 2, Â£34.99\n\nElectronic Arts, ****\n\nImproving on Burnout 3 is like asking a climber to scale Everest after they've clambered up K2. It's possible, but it sure ain't easy. Especially as Burnout 3 set the benchmark for arcade racing, with its ultra-fast gameplay and gorgeous graphics. Thankfully Burnout Revenge, the fourth game in the series, shows no signs of being burnt out.\n\nGraphically it's sharper than its predecessor and it zips along at a few mphs faster too. The gameplay tweaks, meanwhile, are minor but appreciable: each track has numerous routes, you can now smash through slow-moving cars without losing valuable seconds, and revenge has become a valuable gaming device, with opponents who shunt you off the track flagged as targets for retribution.\n\nIt's not the revolution that Burnout 3 was, but Burnout Revenge is still a mightily good game. If you're chasing the adrenaline surge that comes from accelerating over 200mph whilst zigging in between cars and debris with the skill of an F1 driver, then this game is nirvana."
