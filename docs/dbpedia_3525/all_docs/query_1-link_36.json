        "text": "The third installment in the Burnout series, introducing 'Takedowns', which allows players to slam their opponents until they crash. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour.\n\nA lone street racer must use his talents to rise to the top of the Blacklist, comprised of the 15 most elite drivers in the city of Rockport.\n\nMidnight Club is a racing game with lots of cars, trucks, and motorcycles. You can detail any vehicle the way you like and do lots of street races.\n\nJak and his friends must compete in a series of daring road races in order to find the antidote to a deadly poison given to them.\n\nWipEout Pulse is a futuristic racing game where you drive a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground, The year is 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.\n\nMotorStorm has ripped-up the Monument Valley desert, It's obliterated everything that stood in its path on Pacific Rift, and now it's set for a whole new challenge, Battling the frozen wasteland of Alaska's Arctic Edge.\n\nXGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.\n\nThis wet n' wild sequel to the 2001 Sea-Doo racing game Splashdown trades in real world locations for elaborate, imaginative theme-park inspired courses. Blast past Spanish galleons and dodge dangerous booby traps in Cannonball Cove, unleash a horde of ghosts upon a sleepy village in Blackwater Castle, discover the secret of a jungle island populated with dinosaurs in Dino Dominion, and 5 more incredible adventures! Also includes 12 insane indoor stadium tracks, 5 death-defying freestyle courses, and a host of open-water Technical Time Trials.\n\nAs with other titles in the Ridge Racer series, this is arcade racing action, discarding reality in favor of fantasy thrills. There are 14 tracks and 18 cars. You can play a full 'Grand Prix' type season, or play individual tracks against the clock, an opponent or a ghost car. Lighting and reflection effects are built in to the game engine, as is the ability to modify your car's paint job and Replays can be viewed from any angle.\n\nJoin a rapid race by the picturesque tracks and tense escapes from the police, or play as a police officer in Hot Pursuit 2.\n\nUnderground 2 entails tuning cars for street races, while resuming the Need for Speed: Underground (2003) storyline. The game provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races and more.\n\nRace from coast to glorious coast with a fresh new mission structure, the choice of one of 12 fully licensed Ferrari models and online play with up to 6 players for a thrilling head-to-head journey.\n\nIt is the sequel to the 2001 video game Burnout and the second title in the Burnout series with improved graphics, faster gameplay, and bigger, more spectacular crashes."
