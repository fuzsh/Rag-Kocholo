While the tease listing could be written off as a gaffe, more likely, Criterion is looking to double-dip, extending the Burnout franchise in two directions.Similar to how Legends was released in tandem with Burnout Revenge, Dominator could be paired with the forthcoming open-world Burnout 5. Or, given that a PSP engine has already been built, Dominator could be offered as a quickly assembled appetizer to stave off hungry appetites, buying time for the next-gen PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 installment. Toss in a PS2 port, and Criterion has 2007 in the bag.",
