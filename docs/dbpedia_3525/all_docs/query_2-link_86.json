        "text": "Monday 22 January 2007\n\nDeveloper Criterion is slaving away on Burnout 5 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 right now, but if you're one of the millions of speed freaks still rocking the PS2 or PSP, some last-gen love is on the way in the form of Burnout Dominator. Due out in March, Dominator promises a \"pure racing experience\" that'll take the crash-happy series back to its high-speed roots.\n\nWhat this means is that you'll still be able to smash up your rides (and those of your competitors) in a slow-motion death-ballet, but the emphasis on wrecks has been toned way down. Your ability to plow random traffic out of your way is gone; rear-ending a non-competitor will now just make you crash, something we did a whole lot during a lengthy session with the PS2 version. Sadly, the series-defining Crash mode is gone as well, meaning you won't be able to tear through intersections and explode spectacularly for points anymore."
