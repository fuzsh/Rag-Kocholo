        "text": "maybe they actually do want help, leave em alone. just cuz they ask for help doesnt mean they want someone else to do the work, they may e new to modding and trying to learn\n\nLots of things wrong with this. Consider using the console when modding so you can see what exactly is wrong.\n\nFirst off, NEVER use materials.cs as it's becoming unsupported in a few months. Not to metion that your file references non-existent textures and the syntax is wrong. ALWAYS USE NEWEST POSSIBLE MODS AS REFERENCE, and even better use vanilla vehicles instead.\n\nSecond, all your Jbeams have missing brackets. This corrupts the whole mod and that's why they don't show up. Consider using notepad++ for editing Jbeams so that you can easily highlight the brackets. JBEAM IS AN ULTRA SENSITIVE FORMAT AND WON'T TOLLERATE ANY SYNTAX ERRORS.\n\nThird, please use standardized naming. It is such a pain to find the wheels after I get them to show up. Start the name with the size and then a proper name of the wheels instead of just \"zmd\". Similarly the tires,\n\nFourth, none of your slot names match up with each other at all, it's a complete mess, everything should match exactly, and it's so broken at the moment and nothing works even after the wheels show up. All of the names are also duplicated and they should ALWAYS be unique no matter what.\n\nFifth, even after I managed to select the wheels in parts selector somehow, they are invisible and don't have tires, because none of the slot names match up and also flexbody names don't match up with the names in the model.\n\nFourth, the model is not centered properly at all and it's one sided too. You are better off modifying the vanilla 15x8 standard steel wheels since they look similar enough. Also speaking of the size, it doesn't match up, they are much bigger than 17x8, maybe the scale is wrong in Blender.\n\nLastly, PLEASE LEARN HOW TO USE BLENDER PROPERLY. The scene has like a hundred lights and cameras and each mesh has a dozen of different materials. Even after you fix all of the above I doubt this will work because of the mess of materials you have.\n\nIn conclusion, a lot is wrong and you should start over with all of your Jbeam and make a lot of fixes to the model too."
