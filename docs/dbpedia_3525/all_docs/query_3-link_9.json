        "text": "Hello folks.\n\nI've never liked Burnout Revenge as much as other people do. There's numerous steps taken back in this game from Burnout 3 (which is my favourite racing game of all time), most of which I find utterly baffling.\n\n1) The lack of \"single event mode\". Burnout 3 allowed you to, pick an event type, track, car, and then race. Simple stuff. Burnout Revenge ditches this altogether. Meaning that you have to sift through career mode menus to hopefully find the track/event combination you're looking for. It's quite tedious.\n\n2) Traffic Checking. This mechanics lets you punt forward going traffic cars out of your way while losing minimal speed. It ruined the balance Burnout 3 had. That game rewarded finesse weaving in and out of traffic. There was a reason to go onto oncoming traffic as it gave you boost. Or to do a near miss. Now there's no reason to do that since skillessly punting cars gives you boost too.\n\n3) Selection of Cars. Cars that drive at 160 mph and 205 mph look the exact same with a some minor visual modification put on. There were 7/8 unique models maybe with a bunch of clones. Burnout 3 had you start from hatchbacks. to muscle cars, to sports coupes and finally hyper cars. In Revenge you're driving the same cars throughout the whole career mode with a different top speed.\n\n4) Selection of Tracks. The selection in Revenge isnt that bad, but it doesn't have as much variety as 3, with \"marathon\" tracks (two tracks looped together), or point-to-point tracks that Burnout 3 had, not being present here.\n\n5) Sepia filter + bloom. I'll group these two into one because they're sorta have and have a compounding effect. The bloom in this game is absolutely hideous, to the point where the driving road ahead of you looks pitch black at times, and the sky is unbearably bright. Also, the sepia filter really makes most of the tracks in this game devoid of any color other than yellow/brown. It's a shame because the underlying assets of revenge are probably superior, but these two effects means the Burnout 3 looks superior.\n\n6) Takedowns feels inconsistent. In Burnout 3, you generally had a good idea of how big of ram you need to give to rivals perform a takedown. In revenge sometimes you boost up the opponents ass and they wont budge. Other times, you look at them funny, and they get taken down. They tried to emphasize traffic check takedowns (punting a traffic car in rival to take them out), so as a result, road rage is now \"continually punt traffic forward and hope an AI gets in the way and taken down\".\n\n7) Shortcuts. Well, in most events, shortcuts are fine. But, it doesn't go well with time trials. I don't know about others, but for me, a time trial mode in a linear racer is \"how fast you can go around a track\" and not \"how many parts of the track you can skip\". Theres too many shortcuts per track, and the gold medal time requires you take most of them. It adds one too many variables to account for while in the heat of the moment, as you're zipping down the circuit looking out for traffic and hazards while also looking out for short cuts. A flawless run without taking any still wont get you gold most of the time.\n\n8) Crash Mode. There's less junctions this time (50 in revenge, 100 in takedown), which I can forgive since a lot of Revenge crash junctions are bigger in scale. However, what I can't forget is the quicktapping to activate the crashbreaker (it's similar to how you spam A to run in rockstar games). It get's annoying fast.\n\nA lot of smaller gripes too. Impact time (moving your slightly after a crash to take down other drivers) no longer has its own unique music. The sound effect when performing a take down is gone.\n\nThe overhead view of your crash aftermath where it counts up the cars crashed and the money amount is not there anymore. It's small things like these that make Burnout 3's presentation far better.\n\nEliminator events are worse. It's 30 seconds for the last driver to be eliminated. So when you crash once, the race is often over since less than 30 seconds is a short time to recover. Burnout 3 had it so a driver get's eliminated every lap, so you can still recover.\n\nIn Grand Prix events (three successive races), you cant restart an individual race anymore, you have to do all three races again if you want to restart.\n\nThe rubber banding here is too restrictive. Burnout 3 had the right amount of it, where you can still sometimes build 5+ and even 10+ second leads if you dont crash for entire laps. The rubberbanding in revenge is way too excessive, keeps the pack too close. An otherwise flawless race with a crash at the very end means youre guaranteed to finish last.\n\nThere's no option to do road rage without time limits. In the single event mode, no time limit meant you only end when your car takes too much damage. In Revenge, the time limits are horribly done (I dont want to get into detail because this is already a long post, but if some one asks why I'll give them the explanation)\n\nCareer mode isnt as well structured. There's no more car classes, you choose whatever car and the opponents match you. There's no way of knowing how to unlock certain cars, which Burnout 3 did. You just do an event and it randomly unlocks are car. There's also no overhead map of the track layout (there was in PS2/Xbox version but removed in the 360 version, dont know why).\n\nThe star rating system means that coming first isnt enough for five stars, you need to do enough reckless driving (drifting, near missing, air, etc), and sometimes the requirement is tougher that just getting first. It's like how Project Gotham Racing 1 handled kudos, where getting first didn't mean that much, it was more about the kudos.\n\nI dont like the soundtrack as much either, but this is obviously very subjective, so whatever.\n\nSo basically:\n\nRaces are worse because of traffic checking\n\nRoad Rage is worse because of inconsistent takedowns and timer structure.\n\nTime Trial/Burning Laps are worse because of shortcuts\n\nCrash mode is worse because because of a tacked on \"spam the button\" quicktime event\n\nThe selection of tracks/cars is weaker.\n\nInferior graphically due to sepia filter and bloom effect\n\nSelection in cars/tracks not as good\n\nThe lack of a \"single event\" mode\n\nThere are a few things that are improved though:\n\nRemoved crash mode multiplier icons\n\nmore opportunities to airborne, plus vertical takedowns (landing on top of an opponent)\n\ncrash breaker in races (explode your car after a crash to attempt to take down rival racers)\n\nA slighty better handling model and superior motion blur effects.\n\nGood, enjoyable racing game, that is still a blast, but a far cry from the perfection Burnout 3 was. I can't help but feel almost every mode feels compromised in one way or another.\n\nI'd like to hear people's thoughts."
