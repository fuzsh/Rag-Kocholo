We would love to get the PlayStation 2 this fall instead of winter 2000, we would love to have Final Fantasy VIH in our game libraries, and we’d love to own a Dreamcast right now. American gamers are getting the short end of the stick. Please tell me why we get everything a year later than gamers in Japan. P HardknoxSS via internet Here are three reasons japan gets video game stuff first: Sony, Nintendo, and Sega. You recognize the names of these Japanese companies? While innovation certainly occurs in the U S , the J^anese have a knack for taking ideas, improving them, and making them succeed in the marketplace We don't have the space here to list all the innovative Japanese game companies, but you know who they are. If it's any consolation, the Japanese also get the best TVs, sound systems, cell phones, cars, and sushi first They even got Pokemon before we did! Don't feel bad- -just enjoy it when you can. sates, Lies, anc vipce canes I overheard a sales rep at Babbage’s saying that the PlayStation 2's price will be about $6S0-$700 at release Is this true, or Just a lie intended to hype die Dreamcast diat he’s so eager to sell? > DavidR273 via Internet What yot heard was a rumored price for the Play- Station 2. We've heard that the cost of producing the Emotion Engine chip alone could be about $100, so it's not inconceivable for the complete PS2 unit to retail around $499 Is this a propaganda ploy to juice Dream- cast sales/ It’s about as much a ploy as Sony hinting that It'll show the PlayStation 2 on September 17 at the Tok^o Toy Show and then launching the system m Japan in December “GamePra. We’re Mak- ing History” you claim that prior to Super Smash Bros., Mario had never appeared on a GamePro cover. Take a took at your June cover-you may just notice Mario and Yoshi there. Adam King via Internet You win the “Sickest GamePro Reader Of The Year\" prize for remembering that issue . — Undercover Lover QuaKC Me UP wHcn it's ovep Many gamers are wondering what will be remem- bered as the game of the century. My vote is for Quake (PC). Its graphics aren’t that great (even with 3D acceleration), and the single-player mode is boring. However, Quake exemplifies the future: multiplayer gaming. The Dreamcast will have multi- player support, and the PlayStation 2 is rumored to have a built-in modem. So we should acknowledge the game that started the new era-Quake! P- Harry Searing wiu scca sac? The Dreamcast screens look great, but some of those from the PlayStation 2 look incredible, too. So, I have a couple of questions for you experts at GamePro. What system will be the best buy? And how much will the new systems and games cost? ► Jesse Cooper via Internet We'll all buy Dreamcasts. Some of the games we've seen so far .ire impressive (see the special feature this issue. \"Let's Do launch!\"), and we'll be able to play them right away. (The Dreamcast will cost $199 with games retail- ing between $30-$50.) Because the Play- Station 2 won't appear in the U.S for at least .i year, we'll have Did Quake capture the imaginations of people of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds (like Pac-Tlan did)? Did it introduce a genre (Donkey Kong, for platform games), or establish a level of excellence for gameplay (The Leg- end of Zelda: Ocarina of Time)? Quake borrowed concepts from Duke Nukem, Doom, and even Castle Wolfenstein. Our pick for game of the century? The O.J. Simpson trial. SHect Hits t»c rans Will the tragedy in Colorado have an effect on how much violence is allowed in video games? P NanaRamafiS via Internet Game companies are certainly scrutinizing the creative decisions they make about portraying violence in games. Video game marketers are also going to have to tone down violence in ads. Plus, stores are begin- ning to strictly adhere to the ESRB rating system (featured in GamePro).

Now I hear that the release date for the Phantom Menace game for the PlayStation has been pushed to August Is this true? > REIst via Internet That's absolutely true. LucasArts may have known that going in, but we didn't find out until later. The PC version of the game shipped on time — but the PlayStation version needed some ma- jor help. But you can check out the ProReview of the PlayStation version in this issue. MgfiDY BiC peat In issue 129 [June], you state in the Bloody Roar 2 ProReview that there’s no practice mode. Incorrect In custom mode, you just change the “human vs” setting to “practice.” It is also dearly mentioned in the man- ual DonH your reviewers search through every mode, or do I detect a hint of laziness? ► MIdss via Internet Do we detect a hint of snoctinessf We do. We did indeed say that there was no practice mode — because the version of Bloody Roar 2 we reviewed had no practice mode. The mode in question was added later in order to round out the game's depth (the Japanese version has no practice mode either). Shawns Miranda, Waterford, CA Uhduh P.

I’m no longer able to play any saved ^mes. Is there some- thing wrong with my Game Boy or my game? RAR7746423 VIA Internet □ A Nintendo customer service Missingno is one Pok4mon you don't rep answers: \"Catchini Miss- \"> ingno may cause the game to do two things: The graphics in certain areas will look scrambled or your saved games will be corrupted. You’ll know that your saved games are corrupted if you can’t retrieve them. The only solution to this “Missingno\" glitch is to erase all of your saved games and start a brand-new game. To erase all saved games, go to the Main Menu and simul- taneously press B, Select, and t . A menu will appear asking if you want to delete all your games. Delete all the games and start a brand-new game. In the new game, save your game in the area where you have your first battle. Wait a few seconds to make sure the game is saved and then turn off your system for a few minutes. Turn on your Game Boy. If you can play your saved game, then you'll know the glitch has been erased.” The Watch Dog growls: This glitch really sucks — especially if you’ve caught all ISO Pokemon and saved the game with Missingno. You’d think a company like Nintendo would be bug-free — especially with its extensive game-testing division. Perhaps a refund is in order. to anyone who has lost, thrown out, or misplaced theirs because of the confusion created by the big N (jumper Paks go for $4.95 and are sold only by Nintendo). As far as we know. Space Station Silicon Valley is the only game that is unplayable with the Expansion Pak. □ While playing Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64. I entered the code that allows me to fly a car [see “SWATPro,” May]. But if I pause the game when I’m flying the car, the game freezes. What's going on with my game? Trattr VIA Internet □ A Nintendo customer service Does Rogue Squadron’s flying tar i^p responds: “If you want to ■\"«ftee>e! pause the game while flying the car, make sure the camera Is set in cockpit view. If you're in any other camera view before you press Pause, the game will freeze.” □ Every time I go to the local video store to buy a game rated Mature, the store refuses to sell it to me. I'm 1 5 years old and think I'm old enough to make my own decision on what to buy. Does the store have the right to refrjse a sale based on age? Lisa Catron VIA Internet As you walk through this Valley, be sure to use your Jumper Pak. □ In the \"Buyers Beware\" section of your May issue, Nintendo stated that it wasn’t necessary to take out the Expansion Pak once it's inserted into an N64 because old games will still play. So why doesn’t Space Station Silicon Valley work with the Expansion Pak? HAOHMARU71 VIA Internet □ I A Nintendo customer service rep replies: “Space Station Silicon Valley may freeze if there is an Expansion Pak in- serted into the system. The only solution is to insert the jumper Pak when playing this game.’ The Watch Dog snarls: Nintendo clearly stated that all N64 games can be played widi the Expansion Pak inside the system. Now it says that Space Station Sili- con Valley is unplayable with the Expansion Pak. Perhaps Nintendo should give jumper Paks away free □ The Watch Dog explains: Lisa, you may think you’re bid enough, but store owners and the ESRB (the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates games) disagree. You must be at least 17 years old to purchase a game that has received a Mature rating. There are reasons why the ESRB rates a game Mature (overt violence, mature sexual themes, to name a few), and we’re glad to learn that stores are enforcing the rating restrictions.

I Game Boy: There It Grows Again Cell phone companies and Sega (yes, Sega) jump on the Nintendo bandwagon in Japan Nintendo's 10-year-old Game Boy is changing from The Little System That Could to The Little System People Can't Believe. Two early summer announcements serve to support the handheld's continued — if atypical — suc- cess in its homeland pf Japan. In late May, Sega Enterprises President Shoichiro Irimajiri shocked readers of the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun with the revelation that his com- pany would soon sell software for Nintendo's Game Boy Color. Details are still being finalized, but the first title expected to appear is a portable version of the Saturn RPG Sakura Taisen (aka Sakura Wars). For Irimajiri, the decision is purely business. \"We do not have any plans to introduce a portable game system for the time being,\" he said in the interview. \"We also want to make effective use of our software and character resources as new revenue sources.\" Sega may also release games for the Neo*Geo Pocket and Bandai's WonderSwan in Japan. Still, don't hold your breath for an import PlayStation version of House of the Dead; outside the portable market, Irimajiri said that ports to other consoles \"would be difficult to do so long as the Dreamcast exists.\" Roughly a month later, Nintendo announced that it would offer telecommunications software to link the Game Boy to cellular phones, enabling users to download and play games. The innovation, announced by Nintendo of Japan President Hiroshi Yamauchi, will be offered some- time next year in conjunction with mobile-phone service providers in Japan. Nintendo's stock rose a whopping 11 percent the day of the announcement. Not to be outdone, Bandai said that it would offer the WonderGate, an add-on cellular adapter for its own portable, the WonderSwan, before the end of this year. It's worth noting that both of these announcements in Japan may never impact the American market; however, if these innovations prove successful (or more accurately, profitable), Sega and Nintendo may consider bringing them stateside. Nintendo has sold more than 75 million Game Boy units worldwide over the last decade. Sakura Taisen, shown here In Its 32-bit Saturn Incarnation, is expected to be Sega's Game Boy Color release. In early June, Nintendo happily announced a new joint venture in Japan that would introduce an online network for Nintendo 64 gamers, enabling them to access the Internet, play games in online tour- naments, and download new soft- ware this winter. And where are you going to store that software? You guessed it — the long-delayed 64DD disk drive. So when's the 64DD coming out? Nintendo's not saying, but the com- pany does expect to have 10 com- patible software titles out by year's end and hopes to sell half a million units in Japan. Also, in order to access the new network, users will need the 64DD, a modem, and the RAM Expansion Pak. Nintendo ex- pects to offer all of the above as a bundled package, presumably also by December. If the 64DD comes out in Japan, will Nintendo release it in America? With the Dolphin and PlayStation 2 looming, is it already too late? Read GamePro for future developments. Thanks to Nintendo's new online network, the 64DD looks more solid than ever. In Japan, anyway. C/5 EH : pq CO w :z; Acclaim releases Mortal Kombat for home consoles.

Nintendo tossed its chips into the ring at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Nintendo and IBM announced a multi-year $1 billion technology agree- ment to support Nintendo's next home video game console, code-named “Dolphin” (see \"ProNews.\" August). In essence, IBM — sometimes known as “Big Blue\" — will design and manufacture a unique 400 megahertz (MHz) proces- sor. dubbed the “Gekko\" processor, XOO POWER! Odd animal references aside, Nintendo sees the Dolphin with a Gekko inside swimming to the front of the school when it's launched in ^11 2000. The Gekko CPU will be an extension of IBM's PowerPC computer architecture and will feature its 0. 1 8 micron copper technology. The PowerPC, you may recall, was built through a technological alliance of IBM, Apple Computer, and Motorola. However, it's the “0. 1 8 micron copper technology\" stuff that's really pretty cool — in more ways than one. PLATIMC WITH EMOTION In the computer-chip biz, 0.18 micron technology is basically die newest way to produce silicon chips. The 550-MHz Pentium II PCs that sport chips using this technology are just now beginning to roll out, so you probably won't own one for a while. The copper manu^cturing process essentially enables chip builders to use minute copper wires rather than the tradi- tional aluminum connectors to link tiny transistors that are die meat and potatoes of a computer chip. The linking allows for cooler operating temperatures and. consequently, much ^ster speeds than regular silicon chips. IBM is the first chip maker to use this technology — which means Nintendo has it now. and Sony doesn'c Naturally, Nintendo predicts that this and other yet-to-be-disclosed cricks are going to give it major game against Sony’s Emotion Engine processor for the PlayStation 2. To build up its case even more, Nintendo has also revealed that its new system will use a companion graphics chip running at 200 MHz. This graphics subsystem has been created by ArtX, a 3D graphics technology design outfit, and built by NEC. CARTT 9LEEP WITH THE EITIIET To cap its move into the millennium, Nintendo will finally say \"sayonara\" to cartridges, too. Dolphin will support a DVD drive built by Matsushita Electric (of Panasonic fame). The drive's proprietary DVD format will be built to support movies and music. Nintendo has also revealed that it will allow Matsushita to feature Dolphin technology in other \"home appliances.\" ROLPIIIN RREAMT MINTEMBO? IIERF* THE TCeOP ON NINTENOO'T NEW CAME 9T9TEM.

Here’s a full review along with an inter- view with the game’s creator, Shinji IVlikami. T he prehistoric age is finally getting its due with the first decent dinosaur-action game for the PlayStation. Dino Crisis bears several inescapable similarities to Resident Evil, but don't be fooled — this is more than just dinosaurs subbing for zombies. Dino is an adventure-survival game with enough unique aspects to keep hardened action vets riveted to their controllers. Regina’s World Dino's crisis takes place on an isolated, top-secret labora- tory island. You assume the role of Regina, member of a special- forces unit sent there to track down a missing scientist. As soon as the team arrives, however, all hell breaks loose; dinosaurs are running amuck, and you must escape before becom- ing their next meal. But it’s a big island, so there's lots of ground to cover. You'll search for keys, collect weapons, solve puzzles, scamper though airshafts, and of course, battle dinosaurs to avoid extinction. One of Dino's big pluses is the nonlinear gamepiay. You can choose different paths at certain points during the game, giving this Crisis repiay value. There's one drawback to the mas- sive laboratory, chough; too much backtracking. You'll be sent repeatedly to the same rooms. PSOTIP: Search everything-even man- gled body parts. You can also find floor maps hanging on the walls. Guess who's coming to dinner; Special forces member Regina takes on a T-Rex in Dino Crisis, Capcom's latest action-survival game for the PlayStation. “This Is Just Like That Movie...” Fortunately, Dino is an excellent mix of action and strategy. Blasting dinos to pieces is fun — but ammo is in short supply. Frequently, it’s advantageous to avoid dinos by sneaking past them. But what happens if you're cornered and down to your last round? Make your own firepower! You can create your own tranquilizer darts out of various potencies. Some mixtures can put dinos Resident Evil and Dino Crisis share mare than the same genre: They have the same producer, Shinji IVlikami.

It's a good thing you're able to defend yourself during this Crisis, because Dino’s dinos are imbued with an excellent A.I. that keeps the action fresh and exciting. Raptors, for example, will stalk and circle you while waiting for the ideal moment to strike. Pterodactyl will swoop down and grab you for a high-speed air ride into the nearest wall. Compys are totally harmless... one-on-one: in packs, they're almost as deadly as raptors. Some of these feisty prehistoric pests will even clamp onto a limb and thrash you around until you drop your weapon. As for the tyrannosaurus, who needs to be - w ^ clever when you're the size of a battleship?! ' Take IVIe Off the Campy List ^ Luckily, Dino's tight, responsive controls are easy to learn and keep you in firm command. You can run. walk, search, move while aiming, turn 1 80 degrees with the press of a single button, and even kick off attack- ing dinos. The dual shock effects are a plus, too; You'll feel quick jolts during a sudden onscreen attack, or subtle tremors that signal the approach of some- thing big — like a T-Rex.

The various characters are well animated with sharp details, but some dinos sport bulky, awkward polygons. Dino uses fixed camera angles similar to Resident Evil's, but the envi- ronments resemble those ir Metal Gear Solid, which means dark hallways with iow-res surface textures. The upside to this approach is that the transition between screens is seamless, and moveable onscreen objects are harder to spot The biggest drawback to the fixed camera is the \"l-can-hear-my- enemies-but-l-can't-see-them” syndrome where deadly predators lurk just out of camera range and can't be spotted until they attack. On the other hand, excellent sound effects often cue you in on what you can't see. Audio clues, like the scrape of raptor claws and the flap of pterodactyl wings, are effectively conveyed. Plus, the poignant character voices help move the well-written scenario along. The music, though, is a mixed bag. Some eerie sym- phonies work perfectly with the onscreen action; but others sound like a jazz band gone berserk. PROTIP: Compys in packs can inflict serious dam- i. Use 9mm shells to pick them off. Fun Crisis Despite its flaws. Dino Crisis is a solid offering with the right combination of action and strategy — and it avoids the doldrums of being another RE done.

Sonic Adventure puts Sonic the hedgehog in a wild velocity-busting adven- ture with some of his old friends (such as Tails and Knuckles) in seven levels of all-out 3D platform-style mayhem.

You won't have a minute to spare (or a finger with- out a callus) after tearing through the game's challenging worlds — one even focuses entirely on pinball machines. Although already out In Japan, Sonic Adven- ture has undergone some minor changes for its American debut For instance, the camera angle has been slightly tweaked. While most changes were based on American tastes, the Japanese version had strong voice talent for Knuckles and Sonic that will hopefully be dupli- cated (although we could live without Tails's ridicu- lous voice). Regardless of the changes. Sonic will be the most fun you'll have with your Dreamcast If you’re looking for a game with depdi and stamina. Sonic will fit the bill perfecdy.

Even if you change your play- calling and try to go back to the money play, the defense will automatically catch on. Though the gameplay was tight in the preview version, the game ran a little slow. It hasn't been optimized yet, and Sega should have plenty of time to speed things up NFL team playbooks, stadiums, and pliers. When you choose a play, pressing the L- or R-trigger button enables you to bring up the routes that offensive players will run. so there’s no second-guessing the A.I. There’s also an option that makes the QB always throw to the open man — regardless of who you chose as your main receiver. Although there's no mode that lets you clothesline players or beat them silly a la NFL Blitz, penalty-calling will be toned down, so you may be able to get away with a litde extra something,. .like giving someone the business! NFL 2K will certainly be battling other con- I I I tenders (such as NFL Blitz I I ^ I 2000) for the sports bucks I this season, our money's I on this sweet game. The Eye Formation Football Field of Dreams Pigskin Paradise NFL 2K’s variety of offensive for- mations and defensive moves, like wrap tackling, stunt blocking, and feke blitzes, should seriously jack football-sim fens. Plus, a complete NFL li- cense means actual thirst let’s do launch! Virtua Rghter 3tb ■ Developed by AM2 ■ Published by Sega ■ Target release date: 9/9/99 Although a hit among die-hard ™ ^ Virtua Fighter fans (and there are still a lot of you out there play- ing Virtua Fighter 2 on your Saturns), VF3tb will j have a harsh battle as It competes against Soul a Calibur for the hearts. minds, and moolah of Dreamcast fighting game fans. Still, this game with real martial arts moves and fighting styles is a serious mauler that also plays as fluidly as the arcade version. Some minor tweaks are being made, like improving the practice and team battle configurations, but Virtua Fighter 3tb should still be one of the best fighting games for the Dreamcast this year. Q Power Stone ■ Developed and published by Capeom ■Target release date: 9/9/99 Surprise! Capcom’s first fighting game for the U.S. launch of the HBOf Dreamcast isn't a Street Fighter tide! Instead, the fighting-game giant will release the high-energy brawler. Power Scone (already out in Japan). Stone features 3D fighdng in fully interacdve environments: You can throw objects, use weapons, and even climb rafters the ceiling. But the game's most important aspea consists of the three power stones that are scattered through the various stages. The fighter who collects all three gets super abilities for a limited time. It may sound simple, but once you start playing Power Stone, you’ll be hooked. Q Hydro Thunder ■ Developed and published by Midway Home Entertainment ■ Target release date: 9/9/99 Get ready for awildrideas ^ Hydro Thunder storms onto the Dreamcast Featuring all the tracks and super- sonic speedboats of the arcade game (and so secret enhancemwis). Thunder represents everything that fans look- ing for an adrenaline speed rush could want The serpentine tracks feature shortcuts and hidden areas, and the preview version showed great water graphics. None of the boat physics were in yet. so we couldn't tell how fast final gameplay will be — but if it’s anything near the arcade’s, get ready U to get wet Q let’s do launch! Speed Devils The Dreamcast gets its first taste of high-octane arcade road racing with Speed Devils. You can choose from 12 hot-rod racers and grind fenders with your opponents on 8 tracks set in locales that include New York City, Las Vegas, and Hollywood. Each track's loaded with shortcuts, and your path changes with each lap. In addition to Arcade, Championship, and two-player split-screen modes, there's a gambling feature that allows you to put more than just your pride on the line. Q Sega Bass Fishing .Mortal Kombat fans will not be left in die Oucerworld cold this season. Mortal Kombat Gold, a proved version of Mortal feature players from MKII and press time. Midw^ also planned new moves and fatalities for ters. The preview version pl^ed the graphics looked awesome, although collision detection and frame rate still needed some work. Mortal Kombat fans interested in Soul Calibur or Virtua Fighter 3tb will want to look for Gold {for m info, see our cover feature, “Mortal Kombat Goes for the Gold,” August). Q We For laughing, but this game is going to get you hooked on fishing, fans, Bass Fishing’s remarkable water effects and realistic environments make this game a no- brainer. It even comes bundled with a fishing controller that resembles an actual rod and reel. The underwater views were truly impressive. Even non-fishermen will love the Intense action and the unique cast-and-reel gameplay enough to hook up with this title. Get your bass in gear for this game Q Blue Stinger The Japanese version of Blue Stinger was an intriguing action/adventure title that was marred by awful camera angles. However, Activision will correct this major flaw for the game's stateside release. Stinger is reminiscent of Resident Evil: You collect an arsenal of weapons, solve puzzles, and bat- tle monsters. But the game has some unique aspects, too. For instance, you can fight hand-to-hand and switch between two playable characters on the fly. Additionally. Blue Stinger's scope and story will be massive. Q Mh¥r SftO€.i5i>:6 let’s do launch! / Also on the Launch Pad H*r« ar« sem* othar Dreamcasl titles that should be available by 9/9/99. We'll see.

Now Cavedog is firing another volley with Total Annihilation Kingdoms, and the battle shall begin anew. PROTIP: Use two or more building units to quickly summon defensive structures in a iam. PROTIP: Don't spread yourself loo thin. Fully defend each Lodestone with lowers before moving on. K CD-ROM Shakespearean Strategy Looking to improve the weak plot elements of the original TA, Cavedog has bor- rowed a theme from King Lear. Kingdoms sets four bickering royals on a quest to 30 accelerator Q|^g ^helr fallen fether's land. Each monarch wields the power of an element, drawing their power from the game's sole resource, mana. You place receptacles over \"Lodestones\" to replenish your power faster. As opposed to the race-based campaigns of most RTS titles, Kingdoms offers just one story line that jumps back and forth between all four clans and spans 48 mis- sions. Unfortunately, Kingdoms has ditched TA's difficulty adjust- ment and careens from mind-numbingly easy to nigh impossible in one tragic step. PROTIP; To storm a baach, back up your landing partlos wtth lott of pro- ioctlle naval units and. If avallablo, flying attackers or floating lowers. Balancing Act Each kingdom’s advantage lies in its elemental power — air, fire, water, or earth. The quasi-unique races are dubiously balanced for multiplayer challenges (there are questionable problems, like the Zhon race's lack of queues), but there's little rhyme or reason to the technology trees, and it's often difficult to visually discern one type of foot-soldier unit from another. Total Annihilation. ..of Variety Kingdoms' excellent character designs are enhanced by fluid animations and energetic battle cries, from the screech of Griffons to the lightning blast of a Mage Tower. The landscapes are vivid and crisp, but they, along with the placid score, suffer from lack of variety. Kingdoms' clunky map editor allows you to choose between tile sets for each race, but the sets are all strikingly similar — hardly the variety offered in StarCraft. Luckily, both the visuals and audio shine during battle: you'll cringe at the wet thunks of mortal blows and gape at the spectacular blasts of magic. Kingdoms is an exciting, energetic RTS, but each of its elements has already been outdone by superior games. Fans of the TA franchise or RTS freaks who’ve played out everything else won't be disappointed, but this Kingdom isn't the fairest in the land. Q PROTIP; Once you have a feofftold. keep your pre- cious Monarch burled in tiie heart of your defenses and use bask bulkMng units to advance. GRAPHICS 4.0 Kingdoms supports 3D hardware, but there's no zoom mode or rotation, i la Myth. Superb lighting and mage effects dazzle the battlefield, and incredibly lifelike unit animations make you be- lieve in the bloody mayhem — but vari- ety, this game ain't got SOUND 4.0 If Kingdoms’ royal score and unit battle cries don't float your ferry, its screech- ing, crashing, and piercing echoes of war will leave no doubt that Cavedog knows how to put you in the midst of real-time warfare. But again, where's the variety? CONTROL 4.0 The units move fine, but the pseudo- rally point system is weak, there's no mouse double-clicking to select all units of a particular type, and it's awfully hard to figure out who's who. StarCraft doesn't make these mistakes. Piece lowers or projectile attackers with good lines of sight and elevation whenever possible. PROTIP: When defending an all-out assauH. set your magic users to attack with their most powerful spells. FUN FACTOR 4.0 Kingdoms improves on TA's lame story line, but falls short of the epic Star- Craft. while the four races aren't unique enough to warrant completely different strategies. It's still a great game, but the parts of this sum have been outdone by other games.

Once he picks up your trail (constantly grumbling \"stars\" during pursuit), he doesn't let up, even chasing you from room to room. Strange how this thing knows Jill is a S.T.A.R.S. member, even though she isn’t in uniform. Hmmm... ‘We Have To GeV Out of Here!'

Playing as an agent for the OSS (the CIA's WWIl predecessor), you tackle ifj I ^ more than eight missions that span 30 ^ f levels in German-held territories. I t .1 Multiplayer action won’t be neglected: The game provides two-player coop- erative or competitive modes and an interesting \"hot potato” game with live grenades. With the guidance of Steven Spielberg and the experts that helped bring Saving Private Ryan to life, the game overflows with historical accuracy. You’ll fight with real WWIl weapons (bazookas. Browning Automatic Rifles, and much more) to handle missions that actually happened during the war, such ■ — i| as taking out German # 1 995 V2 rocket bases, bat- r ^ tiing through the French Mifl J hedgerows on D-Day, ^ sabotaging the I ^ ‘ atomic bomb research r i V \\ labs in Norway All the attention to detail really looks like it will bring the game to life. The Germans you game actually speak German, creating a spooky immersive atmosphere, (if it’s coo much for you, you can switch to \"bad American movie” mode where they speak English with corny accents.) And the eye-catching environments already sport great detail, including German soldiers wearing authentic uni- forms, which only reels you in more deeply for what should be an absorbing experience. Set across a compelling World War II landscape. Medal of Honor's bringing the glory home to the PlayStation with some siuiing GoldenEye-style action. encounter In Disguise In fact, one of the game's coolest features is Disguise mode — in some levels, you’ll try to sneak your way through enemy territory by donning a German uniform and showing German I.D. papers on demand. The result will be a fresh take on the stealthy action that was popularized in Metal Gear Solid and Syphon Filter, but with an added layer of depth: If you use your papers too often, enemies will wonder why you don’t speak and will grow suspicious, eventually sounding the alarm. The German soldiers are designed with other forms of innovative A.I. For example. If you chuck a grenade at them, they'll kick it away or, time permitting, pick it up ■ and lob it back at you. ■ 1 ^ S8 As long as DreamWorks H keeps all its grenades in y ^ the air during the final phase of development, Medal of Honor should m '% shape up into one of ^ ^ ^ this ^ll's cop action/ adventure titles. ^ ^ y KILLS SEPTEMBER SNEAK pre V Lews Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style FIRST LOOK IT’S A TANG THANG What happens when you take one of the most controversial rap groups of the decade and pair it with one of the most controversial games of the decade^ Find out as Activision takes Thrill Kill and adds the attitude and style of the Wu-Tang Clan. That's right — all your favorite rappers from the Clan are here, including RZA, Oi' Dirty Bastard, and Method Man, along with a crew of others. And yes. Activision has taken the original Thrill Kill engine, done away with some of the raw edges, and used the remaining core to create Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style. So what you should get is one hard-ass tough-hitting fighting game that's bet- ter than the original Thrill Kill in scope and depth, yet retains a bru- tal and sometimes con- troversial flavor. A VIEW TO A THRILL KILL Get ready for a little flava in ya fighting. The Wu are on the loose In their very first fighting game, Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style-H'll make sure no one kills the thrill. NO BUSINESS LIKE SHAO BUSINESS Each of the Wu-Tang has their very own style of fighting, v^ich follows the traditional Shaolin style while incorporating ele- ments of rap into each fight. Inspectah Deck, for instance, strikes with his fingers at strate- gc locations on an opponent’s body, then recoils and quickly strikes again, while GZA uses a microphone attached to a lethal chain to wield the “liquid sword\" — a metaphor for the power of words. Indeed, the only word you'll be able to utter if GZA is on his mark is \"ouch.\" Even if the Wu-Tang were not attached to this game, you would still have a very cool fighter on your hands — and with the thematic musical styling of the Clan in the background of each fight, your ears will also be treated well. The graphics have definitely been improved since the original Thrill Kill (see \"Sneak Previews.\" October '98), and the moves are fester, more accurate, and less defensi- ble. which means the fighting engine has also been greatiy enhanced. Wu-Tang takes traditional Shaolin and adds lots of style for you this fell.
