Hot Pursuit is the 16th title in the franchise and was released in November 2010. Digital download was available starting on 15 December 2010.\n\nHot Pursuit's gameplay is set in the fictional Seacrest County, in which players can compete in several types of races. Players can also compete online (except in the Wii version), which includes additional game modes such as Hot Pursuit, Interceptor and Race. The game features a new social interaction system called \"Autolog\", which is a network that connects friends for head-to-head races and compares player stats for competition. The game also features paid downloadable content in the form of new cars, new race and pursuit events, and new trophies/achievements.\n\nHot Pursuit was well received by critics at E3 2010 and was most notably awarded with Best Racing Game from Game Critics Awards as well as several other media outlets. Upon its release, Hot Pursuit was met with high critical acclaim averaging 90% on both review aggregate websites Metacritic and GameRankings, making it the highest rated game in the Need for Speed series history and one of the generation's highest rated racing games. It won several Best Racing Game awards, including Best Driving Game at Spike’s 2010 Video Game Awards. Reviewers praised the game’s graphics, visuals, crashes, sound and soundtrack, excellent presentation, dramatic races, high-speed chases as well as the new Autolog feature and that it brought the series back to the roots. As of May 2011, the game has sold through approximately 8.5 million units.\n\nContents\n\n1 Gameplay\n\n1.1 Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\n1.2 Wii\n\n2 Development\n\n2.1 Soundtrack\n\n3 Updates and expansions\n\n3.1 Paid content\n\n3.2 EA Crew edition\n\n4 Marketing and release\n\n4.1 Trailers\n\n5 Reception\n\n5.1 Pre-release\n\n5.2 Post-release\n\n5.3 Sales\n\n5.4 Awards\n\n6 References\n\n7 External links\n\nGameplay\n\nMicrosoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\nHot Pursuit goes back to the Need for Speed series' roots and takes on the gameplay style of earlier \"Hot Pursuit\" titles in the Need for Speed franchise with exotic cars and high-speed police chases. It is primarily inspired by the original Need for Speed on 3DO.[citation needed] Hot Pursuit lets players be either a cop or a racer and features a full career mode for both roles. The relationship between the cops and racers is described as \"a dog chasing down a rabbit\", with the cops being more powerful compared to the racers. Each side has several power-ups including calling for roadblocks and radar jamming.[10] According to Criterion the single-player section is somewhere between 12–15 hours long, but with lots of replay value.[11]\n\nThe game takes place in a fictional location known as Seacrest County.[10] It's an open world and features over 100 miles (160 km) of open road, four times larger than that of Burnout Paradise, Criterion's previous title.[12]\n\nHot Pursuit features a new social interaction system called \"Autolog\" described as \"Facebook for the game\".[13] The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes with up to eight players; as an option to live multiplayer racing, players can post records and achievements on the Autolog feed for friends to see, which they then can try to beat. Autolog also contains an experience system called \"Bounty\".[14]\n\nThe driving model of the game is described as \"fun and accessible\", not as arcade-styled as Burnout Paradise, but far from a simulator.[10][14] All vehicles in Hot Pursuit are licensed real-world cars and SUVs, described as \"all the cars you dreamed of driving, in the way you dreamed of driving them\". Most vehicles are available in both racer and police variants, but a few are exclusive to each side.[14][15] Also exclusively featured in the Hot Pursuit is the Porsche 918 Spyder.[16] Ferrari however, last seen in a Shift DLC-pack but notably absent from all other Need for Speed games since Hot Pursuit 2, is also absent from Hot Pursuit.[17] There is no car customization and tuning, \"just because the game really focuses on the Hot Pursuit element.\"[14]\n\nWii\n\nThe Wii version of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is significantly different from other versions in that it takes place in four different cities across the world, instead of just taking place in a single fictional county. This makes the game very similar to Nitro.[18] The game features five different gameplay modes, such as Hot Pursuit, Eliminator, Rush Hour, Interceptor and Time Trial. Also, different powerups are used. The four cities, each set in a different time of day — Chongqing, China, set in the morning, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, set in the afternoon, Rio de Janiero, Brazil, set in the early evening, and Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, which is set in the late evening. The few reviews hint at only a very small significance of this version of the game.[19]\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe game was first hinted at during E3 2009 by EA’s CEO, John Riccitiello. Riccitiello stated that Criterion Games, developers of EA's own Burnout series, was working on a \"revolutionary\" addition to the Need for Speed franchise, stating \"We don't have a plan right now for a separate major launch on Burnout, because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on Need for Speed.\"[20] The game was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June, 2009. \"We've taken the Burnout team and combined it with our Need for Speed franchise. So we now have that in our favor because that Burnout team is probably one of the more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion.\"[21] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, told that he thought Criterion would be a \"great team to work with on that stuff,\" referencing the development of Need for Speed.[22] It was also reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010.[23] EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, \"a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio,\" in a post-financial report conference call.[24] It was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010. with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer.[25] According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.[26]\n\nIn August, before Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit was set to take center stage at EA's press conference during Gamescom, it was announced by Art Director Henry LaBounta that Criterion collaborated with DICE in building the massive open world of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.[27] Early in November, Patrick Söderlund, Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, said this of the collaboration: \"I think the most important thing, when you have two high-quality developers working together, for it to work, they need to have mutual respect. They need to have that respect, to say ‘Ok, we trust you to do this.’ This was a case where that was so obvious, where the Criterion team had a full trust in the DICE team to do what they were doing, and vice versa.\"[28]\n\nRecent games in the Need for Speed franchise included a story, but Matt Webster, producer of Hot Pursuit said \"We didn’t really think it was necessary to include a story. If you’re a cop, the aim is to go up the ranks, while a racer’s aim is to get to the highest rank they can.\"[29] UK product manager for Need for Speed Kevin Flynn said that \"Shift was a great game but different and a bit serious, while Hot Pursuit is more fun and accessible.\"[30] In October, the trophy list for the PlayStation 3 and soundtrack for Hot Pursuit were leaked onto the internet.[31] Early in November, analyst Mike Hickey said he believed EA's Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit could sell 4.2 million copies during the 2010 Christmas period.[32][33]\n\nThe game’s creative director, Craig Sullivan, has said why they didn’t named the game something totally different, \"To be honest when we started out making the game we didn’t know it was going to be called Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, we just didn’t. We got to the game before we got to the name. We realized we were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, so we thought what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it.\"[34]\n\n“ \"Criterion’s a AAA developer of action-racing games, with many years of doing great designs, great innovations, and platform technologies – especially for PlayStation 3 and online connectivity. And they kind of just waited patiently for their turn to get the keys to develop their favorite Need for Speed – and revive Hot Pursuit. Hot Pursuit really is a milestone in the Need for Speed ethos of 'grab an exotic car, pick an exotic location, and hit the pavement'. And that really is a core tenet of Criterion’s expertise. It was really their interest and their call to revive Hot Pursuit.\"[35] ”\n\n— Jesse Abney, producer of Need for Speed: Shift\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe game features 7.1 channel surround sound in PCM (Dolby Digital and DTS are also available). The soundtrack of Hot Pursuit features a general track list as is seen in EA Black Box Need for Speed games such as Most Wanted, Carbon and Undercover rather than a scored soundtrack as seen in ProStreet and Shift.[36] Players can also add custom soundtracks to the game, so that any music stored on the player’s hard drive can be selected during gameplay, as long as they are added to a playlist via the console's system menu.[37] As well as optionally using songs from the player's hard drive, several categories of licensed music are available for the game's racing, menu screens, and the photo mode.[38]\n\nAlternative/rock (including bands such as 30 Seconds to Mars, Bad Religion, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Weezer)\n\nDance/Electro House (including Benny Benassi, Deadmau5, Hadouken!, M.I.A. and Pendulum)\n\nHip-Hop (including Chiddy Bang, Lazee, Lupe Fiasco, Plan B and Travie McCoy)\n\nEA announced the One Million Challenge on 25 November 2010. If the Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit launch trailer received one million views on YouTube by 12 December 2010, a free downloadable content (DLC) pack would be released with three new cars.[39][40] Although the trailer fell short of the million views, EA still awarded the three cars for free. EA stated the cars will be added to the game through a future title update on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360; PC were told that EA will share more news when it becomes available.[41] On 14 December 2010 the first update was released which added the three cars to the player's garage. Xbox 360 players experienced problems with the update.[42] Criterion released another Xbox 360 title update the following day,[43] however, some users reported that the new update had caused their career saves and racing stats to be reset.[44][45] On 17 December 2010 a third title update was released which repaired these issues.[46][47] Criterion released the official second update for the consoles on 15 February 2011, addressing some minor issues and glitches.[48]\n\nCriterion also promised updates to add new features in addition to bug fixes for the PC version. The first update for the PC was released on 26 November 2010 which addressed crashes, issues with aspect ratios, and missing effects. D-Box motion chair support was also added.[49] The second update for the PC was released on 19 January 2011, which fixed issues with flickering graphics, controller configurations, steering response, player car engine audio volume, CPU performance and rare crash issue when entering the Career map screen. The three free cars from the One Million Challenge was also added.[50][51] The third update for the PC was released on 17 March 2011, which fixed several issues players were having relating to game crashes and bugs.[52] The fourth update for PC was released on 4 April 2011, which stamped out another 30 percent of the game's known bugs, with a total of 77 percent of the issues fixed.[53] The fifth update for PC was released on 14 April 2011, as with the most recent patch this new update is mainly to deal with various game crash issues which players have encountered while playing the game. One game crash in particular, which occurred on some systems when players were prompted to \"Press Any Key\", has been fixed in this patch.[54] EA announced that PC version of the game would not receive downloadable content. Criterion confirmed this on their official message boards; \"We have a limited amount of resources that makes it so that we are unable to deliver new content to all platforms, however we do have more updates and content on the way for PC players.\"[55][56][57]\n\nPaid content\n\nIn addition to the free update, Criterion has released several optional, premium packs that add content like new cars and events. The first two DLC packs for Hot Pursuit were released one week after the game's launch. Dubbed Racer Timesaver Pack and SCPD Timesaver Pack. Purchasing either pack grants the gamer immediate access to every car in the game on the relevant side of the law. Buying the Racer Timesaver Pack, for example, gives you access to all the Racer cars, and vice-versa for the SCPD.[58] The third pack for Hot Pursuit was released one week after the first two one. The SCPD Rebels Pack, adds seven new cars to the Racer line-up, including the Audi R8 5.2 FSI and Aston Martin DBS. The cars were previously only available in police variants.[59]\n\nEA announced the first official DLC for Hot Pursuit on 6 December 2010. The Super Sports Pack adds three new cars; the Porsche 911 GT2 RS, GUMPERT Apollo S, and Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport in variants for both sides of the law. There are also 13 new race and pursuit events, and new trophies/achievements to earn.[60] It was released on December 21 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America and on December 22 on PlayStation Network in Europe. Although this is the first official DLC, extra additional content can also be purchased via online storefronts.[61][62]\n\nCriterion’s announced three new DLC packs for Hot Pursuit on 17 February 2011. Armed and Dangerous brings two new online game modes. ‘Most Wanted’ has the cops in pursuit of a single racer in an open world, with the other racers fighting to protect him. ‘Arms Race’ is free-for-all racing that sees weapons enabled. In addition, this pack also contains three new trophies/achievements. It was available from 22 February on the PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE Marketplace.[63][64][65]\n\nThe second and third packs, Lamborghini Untamed and Porsche Unleashed, adds the Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach LP5000 QV and Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, with the Porsche pack adds the Porsche 911 Turbo (1982 Edition), Porsche 959 and 911 Speedster as both cops and racers. Both packs bring 10 new events and four new trophies/achievements. The Lamborghini Untamed pack was available from 1 March and Porsche Unleashed pack from 8 March on the PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE Marketplace.[63][64][65] In addition the Three for All Bundle was released on 22 March only on the PlayStation Store, which is just a big bundle that consist of the Porsche Unleashed, Lamborghini Untamed, and the Armed and Dangerous packs.[66]\n\nEA Crew edition\n\nA limited edition of the PC game was released to EA employees during December 2010. The EA Crew Edition includes seven bonus racer cars; Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren 722 Edition, Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT S, Chevrolet Corvette Z06, Lamborghini Reventon, Bugatti Veyron 16.4, Aston Martin DBS, and Audi R8 5.2 FSI (these cars can now be purchased as racers via the SCPD Rebels Pack.

It then continued to Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Austin and Miami, ending with the Hot Pursuit launch party in Los Angeles.[70][71][72][73][74][75][76] EA received a helping hand from UK vehicle wrapping company Totally Dynamic for the UK launch event, held at Totally Dynamic’s South London centre.[77] In addition to the standard edition, a Limited Edition of the game has been released, which was originally only available through pre-order at the same price as the regular game. However, it is still available beside the regular game, but in limited quantities.

The demo was a limited time demo and closed on 9 November 2010.[79][80][81][82] Criterion Games stated that \"Unlike Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, PC demos require comparatively more resources in order to ensure that they run smoothly across a wide variety of systems,\" for not getting the chance to release a demo for the PC.[83] The demo was a hit, the demo was download more than 2 million times, making the demo for Hot Pursuit the \"most popular demo in Need for Speed history\".[84]\n\nEA announced on 15 November 2010 the first two Games with Developer, both on the first weekend after the game launched.
