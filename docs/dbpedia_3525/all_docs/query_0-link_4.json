        "text": "Post by Seth Drakin of Monster Crap on\n\n119. Mortal Kombat: Armageddon\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon is the seventh game in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. The PlayStation 2 version was released in stores on October 11, 2006 while the Xbox version was released on the October 16, with a Wii version released on May 29, 2007 in North America.\n\nThe game was not released on the Xbox in PAL territories. This game is the last Mortal Kombat for the sixth generation game consoles PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and the first for the seventh generation console on the Wii. It was later released in as part of the Mortal Kombat Kollection on September 29, 2008 for the PlayStation 2. Armageddon is chronologically the final chapter in the original Mortal Kombat storyline.\n\nThroughout the Mortal Kombat universe, the warriors were growing too strong and numerous for the realms to handle. The warriors' powers threaten to utterly destroy the fabric of the MK universe. Upon this scene, the Elder Gods demanded a safeguard to be put in place to absorb the kombatants' insatiable bloodlust. In an enormous crater in Edenia, these warriors clashed in a single battle royale between the Forces of Light and Darkness that would threaten to rip apart reality and bring about the Apocalypse. Without warning, a mysterious pyramid rises from the ground, and the tip bursts into flames, attracting the warriors' curiosity to see what it was. The kombatants fought one another to get to the top, while Blaze, the gods' firespawn revealed himself to them. The firespawn was created by Delia, a powerful Edenian sorceress, and the mother of the main character in \"Konquest\" mode to destroy each fighter that would threaten him in order to save the realms from Armageddon. This would be the warriors' last battle, their last chance to prove that they are worthy of surviving, while many others will die. This will be the final battle for Mortal Kombat, the battle that will determine the fate of the realms.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of Armageddon contain 62 fighters (as well as two extra slots for user created characters), the most of any Mortal Kombat or tournament fighter game to date. Only two characters, Daegon and Taven, are new to the series, while Sareena makes her playable debut on non-portable consoles and Meat makes his debut as a legitimate character.\n\nEach character possesses two fighting styles (instead of the three previously available in Deadly Alliance and Deception), one hand-to-hand and one weapon. Some of the larger bosses, like Onaga, have only one fighting style available (which does not show up, unless you check the character's movelist). Other characters, such as Smoke and Mokap, do not have a weapon style, but a second unarmed style.\n\nAlso new to the series is the ability to create a Fatality. These custom fatalities are a constant series of commands that players input until the Fatality ends. This method of performing Fatalities replaces the character-specific Fatalities of previous Mortal Kombat games, where gamers would simply enter one input and view the Fatality cinematically. As the player adds each input, less time is allowed for further inputs and some moves cannot be repeated. There are eleven levels that can be achieved with Kreate a Fatality, lowest being a basic Fatality to the highest being an \"Ultimate Fatality\". The greater the number of inputs for the fatality, the more amount of koins is gained.\n\nThe Konquest mode in Armageddon is a combination of the same mode seen in Deception with elements borrowed from the spin-off adventure title Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. The storyline centers on Taven and Daegon, two brothers who were put in suspended animation because their mother, known as Delia (a sorceress), and their father, Argus (the Edenian protector god), foresaw a cataclysmic event brought about by the Mortal Kombat fighters. Their awakening leads into the Konquest mode, which in turn leads into the game's standard play.\n\nTaven is the main hero that the player controls in Konquest, while Daegon, his brother, is the primary antagonist, plotting with villains such as Shinnok and the Red Dragon Clan to destroy his brother and destroy Blaze to attain total godhood. Certain weapons are available at times in Konquest mode, which appear to handle very much like those found in Shaolin Monks. Various relics can be collected, one for each Kombatant (except Taven, Chameleon, the two fighters that the player can create in the PS2 version, and additionally Khameleon in the Wii version), throughout this mode. Konquest unlocks characters' alternate costumes and other rewards in the rest of the game, while successfully completing the Konquest entirely will unlock Taven for arcade play. Meat, Daegon, and Blaze can be unlocked by collecting enough relics.\n\nIn addition to the choice of over 60 characters, Armageddon gives players the ability to design and use new fighters in the game.\n\nFrom the number of options, there are potentially thousands of different combinations available. During production, the game offered at least 14 different character classes, which include humans, Tarkatans, Mercenaries, Black Dragon Members, Ninjas, Retro Ninjas, Geisha Assassins, etc. However, after the game's release, only one preset was available to the two genders, Sorcerer to Male, and Tarkatan to Female. Although the clothing of each class is still available, it must be individually unlocked, and cannot be preset. All these presets can be unlocked by unlocking each piece of clothing that makes up that class. The preset will then appear under the preset menu.\n\nPlayers can give their character a unique fighting style, by changing their stance/win pose animation and assigning different (already named) attacks to the buttons on their controller. There is a range of swords and axes (the only weapons available) and special moves to choose from. Most moves and costume items need to be purchased with coins earned in the game's other modes, though some moves and items are available for free from the beginning.\n\nThe fighters can also be given their own storyline. If a player uses their creation to finish a single player game, they will see the ending that the player designed for them, although the ending will cut off after roughly twelve lines or if the last line consists of one word. They could also be used in multiplayer games and online, using the PlayStation 2's online capability or Xbox Live, although the online service for both versions has been since terminated. The ending that the game shows is the same text that the player inputs as the fighter's biography.\n\nMortal Kombat: Armageddon's mini-game is named \"Motor Kombat\". True to the name, Ed Boon compares it to Mario Kart in the September 2006 issue of Official Xbox Magazine. Each of the characters has a customized go-kart, as well as their own special moves. The Motor Kombat characters keeps their cartoonish \"super deformed\" style that was introduced in Deception's Puzzle Kombat mode. It also includes style-based fatalities for characters, and deathtraps. The cars are based on the characters' look and personality - for instance, Baraka's car has blades on the front bumper as a homage to Baraka's Blades and Scorpion's Car is powered by a skull breathing fire as a homage to his Toasty Fatality\n\nMotor Kombat features online play, as well as off-line support for up to four players (two players in PS2 version) with a split-screen display. In the game, players can knock their opponents into various deathtraps on the courses, like rolling pins stones, crushers, slippery snow caves filled with stalagmites and endless pits. The character roster for Motor Kombat is Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Bo' Rai Cho, Jax, Baraka, Raiden, Kitana, Mileena, Cyrax and Johnny Cage.\n\nArmageddon contains every single fighter from the six main fighting game installments of the franchise and their upgrades, not counting the adventure games like Special Forces and Shaolin Monks. Khameleon, a secret character from the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy (not to be confused with the male Chameleon) was absent from the PlayStation 2 and Xbox version of Armageddon. Due to fan demand, she was added to the character roster of the Wii version of the game.\n\nThe Krypt in Armageddon features an unused concept video for Ermac's bio, which caused rumors to circulate that bios had been created for the game but weren't included due to time constraints. However, Midway, through fansite Mortal Kombat Online, confirmed that no bios had been created. A month later, in a chat event held by Mortal Kombat Online, Ed Boon confirmed that bios would be made available on the Armageddon website. Kenshi's bio was the first to be released, on December 21, 2006, and other bios have been made available since then. As of October 15, a moderator on the Midway forums confirmed that the remaining Armageddon bios were canceled so the MK Team can move further along in the development of Mortal Kombat 8 which would eventually become Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.\n\nA \"Premium\" edition was released in North America for the PlayStation 2, featuring the following content in a steelbook case: a 60-minute bonus DVD with a History of Fatalities movie and new videos for more than 50 characters, an animation cell of the cover art autographed by creator Ed Boon, and also an arcade-perfect version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 included in the main disc. There are 4 package design variations, some exclusive to certain stores featuring different character sets or the Mortal Kombat dragon emblem.\n\nThe Wii version of Armageddon has a new motion-based control system, along with playability on the Classic Controller and a GameCube controller. It also has a new Endurance Mode, a Wii Remote Training Mode, new menu screens, and Khameleon as a playable character; however, this version does not have online features.\n\nReception for Mortal Kombat: Armageddon has been generally favorable with an average critic rating of 78% for the PS2, 79% for the Xbox, and 72% for the Wii at GameRankings. The game was notably praised for including a complete character roster. IGN stated that \"the inclusion of 62 total warriors is a massive achievement,\" while Game Informer said that \"nothing really comes close to what Midway has thrown together here.\" GameSpot praised the Konquest mode, \"which was such a low point of MK: Deception, is one of the relative strengths of MK: Armageddon.\"\n\nReception to the Kreate-A-Fatality feature was mixed. While GameSpot called it \"a disappointing replacement to the classics,\" IGN noted not having set fatalities adds variety to gameplay. The reception to the Kreate-A-Fighter mode was also mixed, where some noted limitations yet with others like GameSpy saying they \"haven't seen a character creation tool this robust since City of Heroes.\"\n\nThe game's engine was criticized for being built entirely upon that of the previous 3-D Mortal Kombat titles. PSM went as far as saying the system was not innovative. While many of the gameplay flaws in MK: Deception have been fixed (lack of a wake-up game that allows 50/50 attacks upon knocking down an opponent, and the slow jumping system, which prevents players from jumping over most projectiles, infinite combos), new glitches arise with the new Air Kombat and Parry systems. Eurogamer noted that despite the large choice of characters, \"much of this number is made up by the huge number of clone characters\" and that \"so many characters look and play alike.\"\n\nThe game won the award for Best Fighting Game at the Spike Video Game Awards in 2006. IGN named it as the Best PS2 Fighting Game. The journal Official Xbox Magazine put Armageddon as the \"Xbox Game of the Year\" during an issue from 2006. Gaming Target put the game in its \"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2006\" selection.\n\nAs well as its counter part Mortal Kombat: Deception, Armageddon was not played at big name tournaments like Evolution Championship Series, but was played at many local tournaments and still seems to have a cult following of sorts. Pakistan also held a tournament for Armageddon that was the biggest Tournament the country had ever seen.\n\nPost by Seth Drakin of Monster Crap on\n\n117. Beyond Good And Evil\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft and released in late 2003 for the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox platforms. The story follows the adventures of Jade, an investigative reporter and martial artist, who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy. The player controls Jade and allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and obtaining photographic evidence.\n\nMichel Ancel, creator of the Rayman series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. Beyond Good & Evil was a commercial failure, but was critically acclaimed, receiving a nomination for \"Game of the Year\" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. A sequel, Beyond Good & Evil 2, is currently in development.\n\nA full HD re-mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action-adventure game with elements of puzzle-solving and stealth-based games. The player controls the protagonist, Jade, from a third-person perspective. Jade can run, move stealthily, jump over obstacles and pits, climb ladders, push or bash in doors and objects, and flatten herself against walls. As Jade, the player investigates installations in search of the truth about a war with an alien threat.\n\nIn the game's interior spaces, the player solves puzzles and make their way past enemies in order to reach areas containing photographic evidence. Jade's main tools are her Jô combat staff (a melee weapon), discs for attacking at range, and a camera. Jade's health decreases when attacked by enemies, and health can be restored by using fictional food items \"Starkos\" and \"K-Bups\". She can also gain extra hearts by collecting PA-1s. If Jade's health is depleted, she will restart at the last checkpoint. Certain stealth segments later in the game will automatically kill Jade if she is detected.\n\nAt times, it is only possible to advance in the game with the help of other characters. The characters are computer-controlled, and players direct them via contextual commands. For example, the player can order them to perform a \"super attack\", either pounding the ground to bounce enemies into the air, allowing the player to hit them from long distances, or knocking them off balance, making them vulnerable to attack. These allies also possess a health bar and are incapacitated if their health is depleted. Jade is also able to share some of her items, such as Starkos or PA-1s.\n\nIn addition to obtaining evidence and completing assignments, Jade's camera can be used to take pictures of animal species in exchange for currency and scan objects to reveal more information about the environment. When the \"Gyrodisk Glove\" is obtained, Jade can attack enemies or activate devices from a distance using the camera interface. There are also various minigames and sub-missions offered by NPCs scattered throughout the world.\n\nA hovercraft is used to travel around the world, and also used for racing and in other minigames. Later, the spaceship Beluga is acquired. The hovercraft can park on board the spaceship. Both vehicles require upgrades in order to reach new areas and progress through the game. Upgrades are purchased using pearls that are collected throughout the game. Pearls can be gained by completing missions, exploring areas, filling in the animal directory or by trading credits for them. The vehicles have a boost ability, and can be repaired using a \"Repair Pod\" if damaged by enemies.\n\nThe main city serves as a hub, allowing the player access to the various areas that must be explored in order to expose the conspiracy. Jade can earn credits by defeating enemies, taking pictures or completing assignments, which can be used to purchase additional items for both Jade and her vehicles.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in Sector Four, a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place was designed with a rustic European style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as e-mail and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spaceships and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with humans. The once-peaceful planet is under siege by aliens called the DomZ that abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. A military dictatorship called the Alpha Sections takes power, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite its public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing it to be in league with the DomZ.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil's main protagonist, Jade (voiced by Jodie Forrest), is a young photojournalist. She resides in an island lighthouse that doubles as a home for children orphaned by DomZ attacks. Pey'j (voiced by David Gasman), a boar-like creature, is Jade's \"uncle\" and guardian figure. Double H, a heavily built human IRIS operative, assists Jade during missions. He wears a military-issue suit of armor at all times. Secundo, an artificial intelligence built into Jade's storage SAC, offers advice and \"digitizes\" items. The main antagonists are the DomZ High Priest, who is the chief architect of the invasion, and Alpha Sections leader General Kehck, who uses propaganda to gain the Hillyans' trust, even as he abducts citizens to sustain the DomZ.\n\nJade and Pey'j are care-taking the children of Hillys orphaned by the DomZ. When Jade runs out of money to run the shield that protects them, she finds a photography job, cataloguing all the species on Hillys for a science museum. She is recruited by the IRIS Network, which suspects that the Alpha Sections are behind planet-wide disappearances. Jade's first target of investigation is an Alpha Sections factory. She discovers evidence of human trafficking orchestrated by the DomZ under the Alpha Sections' authority. Along the way she rescues Double H, who was kidnapped by the DomZ and subjected to torture. Pey'j is abducted by the DomZ and taken to a slaughterhouse that is to be launched to a lunar base. After failing to extract Pey'j from the slaughterhouse in time, Jade learns that Pey'j was, in fact, the secret chief of the IRIS Network.\n\nIt becomes clear that the Alpha Sections are being possessed and manipulated by the DomZ. Using the Beluga, the ship Pey'j used to travel to Hillys, Jade and Double H go to the DomZ lunar base. There, Jade finds Pey'j dead, but a strange power inside her brings back his soul, reviving him. After rescuing Pey'j, transmitting her final report, and sparking a revolution, Jade confronts the DomZ High Priest. She learns that her human form is the latest container to hide a power stolen from the DomZ centuries ago. It was stolen hoping that the High Priest, who must have spirit energy to survive, would starve to death. But he managed to find a substitute energy in the souls of all those kidnapped from Hillys. Using the power, she is able to defeat the DomZ High Priest, though nearly losing control of her soul in the process, and revive and rescue those that have been abducted. In a post credits scene, a DomZ spore grows up on Pey'j's hand back on Hillys.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil was developed by Michel Ancel, the creator of the Rayman video game, at Ubisoft's Montpellier studios in France. The game was developed under the codename \"Project BG&E\", with production lasting more than three years. A group of 30 employees comprised the development team. Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, fully supported the project and frequently met with the team. After years working on Rayman, Ancel wanted to move on to something different. He recalled that the goal of Beyond Good & Evil was to \"pack a whole universe onto a single CD—mountains, planets, towns. The idea was to make the player feel like an explorer, with a sense of absolute freedom.\"\n\nThe second goal behind Beyond Good & Evil's design was to create a meaningful story amid player freedom. In an interview, Ancel said that the linear nature of the gameplay was necessary to convey the story; player freedom was an experience between parts of the plot. He also strove to create a rhythm similar to a movie to engage and delight players. The game drew on many influences and inspirations, including the Miyazaki universe, politics and the media, and the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In creating the lead character, Ancel's wife reportedly inspired the designer, who wanted to portray a persona that players could identify with.\n\nThe game was first shown publicly at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it received negative reception. Originally more \"artistically ambitious\" and resembling games like Ico, the game was substantially changed in order to make it more commercially appealing. Jade, originally a teenage girl, was redesigned to be more powerful and fitting of her job. The game was also shortened by removing long periods of exploration due to Ancel's dislike of this aspect of gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The development team was \"demoralized\" by the changes, with Ancel commenting that the finished game resembled a sequel more than a reworking. Prior to release, playable previews of the game were offered in movie theaters.\n\nThe soundtrack of Beyond Good & Evil was composed by Christophe Héral. Héral was hired by Ancel to compose the soundtrack of Beyond Good & Evil due to his background in film. Hubert Chevillard, a director that Ancel had worked with, had also worked with Héral on a television special, The Pantin Pirouette, and referred him to Ancel. Héral was assisted by Laetitia Pansanel, who orchestrated the pieces, and his brother Patrice Héral, who performed some of the sound effects and singing.\n\nThe soundtrack incorporates a wide variety of languages and instruments from around the world. Mainly Bulgarian lyrics were chosen for the song \"Propaganda\", which plays in the game's Akuda Bar, to allude to the Soviet propaganda of the Cold War. It uses a recording of a telephone conversation by Héral with a female Bulgarian friend to represent the government's control of the media. It also incorporates Arabic string instruments and Indian percussion. A song called \"Funky Mullah\" was originally planned to be used in the Akuda Bar, but it was replaced by \"Propaganda\" because Héral decided that its muezzin vocals, recorded on September 8, 2001, would have been in bad taste in the wake of the September 11 attacks. \"Fun and Mini-games\", a song that plays during hovercraft races and other mini-games, includes Spanish lyrics. The lyrics for DomZ music were created from a fictional language with prominent rolling \"r\" sounds. The crashing metal sound effects of \"Metal Gear DomZ\", music played during a boss fight, were recorded from the son of Héral's neighbor playing with scrap metal. The voices in the city of Hillys were also recorded by Héral himself. The music has never been published as an album, though it has been released in its entirety as a free download by Ubisoft. The soundtrack is featured in the Video Games Live international concert tour.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil received generally positive reviews on release. On the critic aggregate web site GameRankings, which compiles video game review scores into an average, the various versions of the game have scores ranging from 83.2% for the PC version to 88.2% for the Xbox version. On Metacritic, the game has scores from an 83 for the PC version to an 87 for the GameCube and Xbox versions. Prior to its release, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine and PlayStation Magazine praised the game's showing at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo and described it as one of the best titles on display.\n\nThe game's graphics were generally well received. In reviewing the GameCube version, Game Informer wrote that \"Every moment of Beyond Good & Evil looks as good as a traditional RPG cutscene\" and that the game's effects and character animations were \"amazing\". Jon Hicks of PC Format wrote that while some effects were excellent, the game's otherwise unspectacular graphics were unwelcome reminders of the game's console roots. 1UP.com and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, however, cited glitches such as frame rate as irksome because the game did not appear to tax the console's hardware.\n\nEdge commended the game for its storytelling and design, but criticized its plot as unable to \"match Jade's initial appeal\", becoming \"fairly mundane\" without \"the darkness and moral ambiguity suggested by the title\", and Jade's everyman appeal being undermined by the revelation of her \"mysterious hidden identity\". Dan Toose of Icon Magazine called the game's setting \"dark, baroque and earthy, a far cry from the squeaky-clean action of the Final Fantasy games\", describing the game as \"a very European take on the role-playing genre\" and \"one of the best adventure games in years\". Star Dingo of GamePro commented that the game was a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" that \"never really lives up to its title\", adding that its vision could have been more focused. Among complaints were control issues and a lack of gameplay depth. Game Informer's Lisa Mason wrote that the game's controls were serviceable, but simplistic, and that she wished she could do more with the character. PC Gamer's Kevin Rice found most of the gameplay and its exploration refreshing, but called hovercraft races \"not much fun\" and felt combat was the game's weakest element. Edge called the gameplay interaction \"hollowed out\" as an unintended consequence of Ancel's attempt to streamline the game.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil was not a commercial success. The game saw poor sales upon its release in the 2003 Christmas and holiday season. Retailers quickly decreased the price by up to 80 percent. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine staff attributed the poor sales of the game—among many other 2003 releases—to an over-saturated market, and labeled Beyond Good & Evil as a commercial \"disappointment\". In retrospect, Ancel noted that consumers at the time were interested in established franchises and technologically impressive games. Coupled with the amount of \"big titles\" available, he stated that the market was a poor environment for Beyond Good & Evil and that it would take time to be appreciated. The Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine staff further commented that the lack of marketing from Ubisoft and the game's odd premise naturally reserved it to obscurity. Part of the disappointing sales stemmed from Ubisoft not knowing how to market the title, something that Ubisoft North America CEO Laurent Detoc labeled as one of his worst business decisions. At the time, Ubisoft's marketing efforts were more focused on the release of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Ubisoft's former North American vice-president of publishing, Jay Cohen, and its European managing director, Alaine Corre, attributed the commercial failure of the game to a lack of marketing. \"The game play was there, the technical excellence was there but perhaps the target audience was not there,\" Corre told the BBC. The game was intended to be the first part of a trilogy of games, but the game's poor sales placed those plans on hold at the time.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil was nominated for and won many gaming awards. The International Game Developers Association nominated the title for three honors at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards: \"Game of the Year\", \"Original Game Character of the Year\" (Jade) and \"Excellence in Game Design\". Ubisoft titles garnered six of eleven awards at the 2004 IMAGINA Festival in France, with Beyond Good & Evil winning \"Best Writer\" and \"Game of the Year Team Award\". The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated the game for \"Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development\" at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. In IGN's \"The Best of 2003\", the PlayStation 2 (PS2) version won \"Best Adventure Game\" while the GameCube version received \"Best Story\". Beyond Good & Evil's audio was also recognized. The game was nominated for the \"Audio of the Year\", \"Music of the Year\", \"Best Interactive Score\", and \"Best Sound Design\" awards at the second annual Game Audio Network Guild awards. It was similarly nominated for the \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\" awards at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards.\n\nIn 2007, Beyond Good & Evil was named 22nd-best Xbox game and 12th-best GameCube game of all time by IGN. Game Informer listed the title 12th on its \"Top 25 GameCube Games\" list. In another list, \"Top 200 Games of all Time\", Game Informer placed the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of Beyond Good & Evil as the 200th best. The Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it as the 91st-best Nintendo game, while Nintendo Power ranked it 29th. Nintendo Power placed the GameCube version as the 11th-best GameCube game of all time in its 20th anniversary issue. Destructoid ranked the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions as the 6th-best game of the decade. GamesRadar placed it as the 70th best game of all time.\n\nAncel stated his desire to produce a sequel to the game. Ubisoft announced at the Ubidays 2008 opening conference that there would be a second game. A sequel, tentatively titled Beyond Good & Evil 2, is currently in development. Development was temporarily halted to focus on Rayman Origins."
