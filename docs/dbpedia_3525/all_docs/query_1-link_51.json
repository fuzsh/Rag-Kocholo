        "text": "SullysCigar462d ago\n\nI don't know why - and I know I'm probably on my own here - but I liked Takedown more. I think it was just 'different' enough to feel fresh. I also loved the destruction.\n\nOn that note, a new Motorstorm would be nice! All that mud, dust and car pieces flying everywhere blew my mind on PS3 - imagine what they could do now.\n\nRatchetlombax524d ago\n\nI hope you'll have fun plugging your PS2 to a modern 4K TV, because you'll need a component cable ($10 to $15 w/o shipping) if you want a decent enough quality, then a component to HDMI converter (approx. $30)... And that's if you haven't sold your PS2 and/or your game in the past 20 years, because that would set you for another $50-$60 (plus don't forget the memory card and/or the controller, because you'll have to have those too).\n\nAnyway, once you're set, the game will only run in a 4:3 aspect ratio (that'll mean that either your image will be stretched to fit your TV screen, or you'll have black borders on the left and right sides of your display). Plus, Burnout 3 featured an online play feature that is now long gone (and I'm sure you don't remember the hassle it was to create a PS2 online account, plus I'm pretty sure that's not something you can do anymore).\n\nBy making an HD remaster/remake, it'll mean enjoying fixes for all those problems, plus updated textures and 3D models, and it would really be cheaper for the consumer: I don't think paying approximately $100 to play a blurry mess without your friends is really worth it, but hey, you do you ;)"
