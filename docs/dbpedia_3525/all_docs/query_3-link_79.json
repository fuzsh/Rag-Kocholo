        "text": "I hadn’t particularly played many racing games so far, only a small handful(but played a lot of those small handfuls, however) in the form of Burnout Revenge and a few of the later Need for Speed games(particularly only Hot pursuit(2010) and Most wanted(2005 and 2012)) and my personal favourite, Midnight Club 3:DUB Edition Remix on the Playstation 2.\n\nMost of those games are arcade-racers with their focus mostly on the fun, fast-paced experience that’s shown through fairly unrealistic handling models of the cars, but that’s what makes them special. GRID Autosport on the other hand, is a sim racer.\n\nShort for Simulation Racer, These kind of games focus heavily on the more realistic side of driving and the way the cars handle in those games reflects to a fair extent on how those cars would be in real life. GRID Autosport achieves this not only in one form, but in five different ones. In the older GRID games you had to play your career mode linearly, taking on one region after another in Race Driver: GRID to one club after another in GRID 2. In one game you’re managing your own team to try and compete in the world’s most popular championships and in the other you’re working for an investor that wants to launch his own Worldwide competitive racing league by going and challenging racing clubs all over the world. Both were very straightforward and not particularly open in terms of the choices you have available to you at any point of time.\n\nGRID Autosport however, has none of that. No managing your own team and sponsors nor winning races to please anyone so that they get interested in your own racing league eventually. The only thing you do is race for other teams in championships, only this time there are five different racing disciplines, Each with their own championships to participate in.The only thing players need to do is pick one and experience the thrill of professional motorsport, working your way up through the ranks by gaining experience points winning events, and moving up to the higher categories of cars, eventually reaching the top. The disciplines are — Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner and Street. Each and every one of them is unique simply in terms of what you feel when driving in them.\n\nTouring or Touring Cars, takes the experience of championship racing offered by Touring Car Championships in real life. Starting from category C, you go all the way up to category A and the Super tourers line of cars which is the highest level it offers. Each event is divided into two races(or two ‘legs’ of a race) and it has a Practice and a Qualifying session to decide your place on the starting grid of the game. The second race event involves racing with a reversed grid order(meaning you start in the last position if you qualified for first place and vice versa) which prevents the experience from getting repetitive by having to race the same race again.\n\nThese races are intense, with the cars racing in tight packs leaving very little room to manoeuvre between any two of them, and the player is constantly challenged to find space and draft behind them to overtake and gain positions. The cars have quite some grip so you’re made to watch how you take your corners on the track, even when not overtaking. It’s thrilling trying to race within a pack of other cars busily looking for opportunities to overtake, while still looking ahead to see when the next turn comes up on the track so you can hustle to position to take it.\n\nOpen Wheel refers to the Indycars and Formula A, B and C racing experience. While they don’t quite go all the way up to Formula 1(due to probable licensing issues), these cars certainly do their best to get you as close as possible to it. They have incredible grip and are the fastest cars to drive in the game. When racing in this discipline, you’re equally hard pressed to keep the car on the tarmac while also thinking about overtakes and where your opponents are. If the car is accidentally driven out of the track for a single second you stand a very high chance of spinning out unless you’re quick enough to respond to the car swaying from side to side and save it from careering off the track which is possible, but takes a lot of practice. As you go up categories from Formula C to A, the cars feel so much more differently than the previous ones with a tremendous increase in pace which takes at least a good 2 races(including the practice and qualifying sessions) to properly get a hang of.\n\nEvents in the championships for this discipline feature 2 races with a practice and qualifying session. It provides enough time to prepare, tune your car and master the track before the race.\n\nEndurance takes a page off of the racing experience of championships like the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The vehicles in this discipline are classified into Endurance groups from 2 to Ultimate. It features long races across lengthy tracks that last for a specific amount of time rather than a few laps, with the winner decided on who covered the most distance going around the track after the time runs out. This is also the only discipline to implement the concept of tyre wear, wherein your tyres gradually start losing their grip over the course of the race the more you go around the track. It’s constant for the most part but small mistakes like braking improperly leading the car to slide around a corner can destroy tyre life and increase the rate at which they wear out. It’s practically your second battle besides the one you’re already fighting against your opponent racers. Towards the end of these races your car handles like as if it were suddenly running on ice instead of the tarmac. You fight with your own car to get it across turns properly without spinning out and losing your position. It’s trying, it’s unforgiving, but it’s certainly fun.\n\nThis discipline usually takes place on the entire length of tracks. There are about 22 main tracks and all of them are shared across disciplines with only specific portions of them used for particular races in any discipline. Races from the Endurance discipline utilize the entire track to provide as much distance to cover as possible in a single lap so as to avoid the monotony of going around a short track for 10 minutes.\n\nTuner translates the experience of American Muscle car racing, drifting events and time attack races. It’s the most varied race discipline that puts these three kinds of races together in no specific order across championships. In Drift events, you can drift across wide open tracks scoring points for the angle and the speed with which you drift across and how close to the edges(both inside and outside) of the track you are for bonus points along the way. It’s held in a one-on-one knockout format with a qualifying round leading to the quarterfinals, then to semis and eventually the finals which if won, makes you the winner of that event.\n\nIn Time Attack events, you get 3 laps on a track and have to post the fastest lap time across the track compared to everyone else, much like the qualifying runs of the Touring, Open Wheel and Endurance disciplines. Even though it can be considered as just a glorified qualification session with different cars competing for the best time, the length of these races suggests that the player will have to maintain his composure for longer across the track to get a competitive enough time in compared to qualification sessions which are fairly quicker. The game also uses other racers as an obstacle in your way as trying to overtake them can take a toll on your lap time for that particular lap.\n\nVehicle categories in this discipline range from Muscle cars to Modified to Super Modified for the Time Attack and Race events, and from C3 to C1 for the drift events. Each car in a particular category having its own handling model and way to drive them. The cars here drift just as well as they have grip so it allows for some showy racing, the kind to please crowds with your skill depending on how well you do.\n\nThis is also the only discipline where the whole concept of finishing in first place takes on a new meaning. Aside from a race event, being first across the finish line isn’t always the way to win. In Drift events, the one who has scored more points drifting wins. In Time Attack events, the one who has posted the fastest time wins, not necessarily the one first across the line; The event doesn’t even take place in that manner to begin with as it just starts you on a busy track where everyone else is trying to post their own fastest lap times.\n\nAnd finally, Street discipline translates the experience of hot hatch, performance-grade modified cars and Supercar/Hypercars in championship races. The championships in this discipline are mostly held in city-courses where you race on the streets and main roads of popular cities like Chicago, Barcelona, Paris and Dubai to name a few. These courses are very narrow so the races are very tight, requiring a lot of focus to make sure your car does not bounce around the track like some sort of pinball.\n\nCategories in this discipline include Hot Hatches, Performance GTs, Supercars and Hypercars. This discipline is the most accessible even to players with no prior experience with racing games as it scales smoothly into the next level of difficulty in the higher categories. You get a good 10 minutes to practice driving the car on the track for every event but in this discipline there is no qualifying; your start is determined by your place in the Championship Leaderboard after a race. The higher up you are on the Championship Leaderboard, the further back you start from on the grid.\n\nThe handling model evolves rapidly as you go from one category to the next in this discipline. Unlike in the other discipline wherein going to the next higher category only meant faster and more controlled handling of the car, street discipline instead almost gives you a completely different one to race in similar tracks.Going from a hot hatch to performance GTs is an enormous change in the type of car you’re driving as hot hatches tend to slide around a lot in corners while performance GTs have all the grip in the world to handle the speeds to take the same corners at. This difference is immediately apparent when driving your first race with performance GTs after having a field day with hot hatches till that point.\n\nThe supercars and hypercars are a handful to drive and you will be hard pressed to find your comfort driving any of them at first. They slide, they hold their grip at breakneck speeds and some do a bit of both. However, once mastered these machines provide a lot of satisfaction and will prove a fitting highest level for this discipline.\n\nBefore getting into your first races in all these disciplines the game plays an introductory video to create some hype getting into them and finding out what they are like. The game tells you what to expect and how to go about driving in these disciplines. I was not particularly hyped for this game before buying it and only just happened upon picking it up and playing it one fine day. But from the get go, watching those short introductory videos made me so hyped for the races and I was completely hooked onto the game right then and there, barely about 2 or 3 hours in. You have a longing to just see what the next level is like once you just about start getting used to the current category of cars and the races.\n\nThe career mode sees you, the player join up and race for teams in specific championships in the various racing disciplines. Each championship counts for one season and the player can switch teams anytime he likes for the subsequent seasons. Only 2 teams will be willing to sign the player when going for a new championship at first, but the player can choose to participate in those championships again if he/she wishes and have more team offers up for grabs. You also have a teammate racing with you and certain sponsor objectives require you beating him/her to get the experience.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, both in the day and in the night. The track layout is accurate as is the look of it along with the background. The sounds of the car are amazing and they certainly contribute a lot to the immersion of the game. This is also the first game where I actively began using manual transmission albeit on a controller. I highly recommend players use it even on a controller as it gives you more control of the car when taking it across turns on track.\n\nThe game has the traditional options for any sim racer in the form of ABS, Traction Control as well as tuning your car to suit your needs and for the track. It takes a bit to understand how the system works and which parameters to consider for the track, but again, tuning isn’t completely necessary for the more casual player looking to simply race.\n\nThe Damage model in this game is very well made. Damage can be modified to show only visually without affecting performance but where’s the fun in that? Your car can suffer all sorts of problems just from a simple bump when going at high speeds, the first being your steering wheel going out of alignment and your car turning left or right by default requiring you to correct your course every second, and then going on to worse problems like a damaged engine which significantly drops the acceleration and top speed of the car. It’s well implemented, properly punishing players that make mistakes damaging their car.\n\nThroughout the race you have a race engineer that gives you general information like your pace or how many laps are left, but you also have an option to get specific information on your own like your current position, your teammate’s position, your event rival’s position and the condition of your car. This is especially useful when racing in hard or very hard difficulty where you’re usually too busy racing and trying to beat the challenging AI otherwise to find the information for yourself.\n\nThis was the first sim racer that I played fully having played only Arcade-style games in the racing genre so far, and I thoroughly enjoyed what the game offered, be it the different disciplines, to tough and challenging AI to just the look and feel of the game. Anyone looking to enter the world of sim racing, away from the arcade-style formula of racing games can easily do so by giving this game a shot."
