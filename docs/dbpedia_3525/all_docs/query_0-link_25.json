        "text": "Citation preview\n\n“Tracy Fullerton’s Game Design Workshop covers prey much everything a working or wannabe game designer needs to know. She covers game theory, concepting, prototyping, testing and tuning, with stops along the way to discuss what it means to be a professional game designer and how to land a job. When I started thinking about my game studies course at the University of Texas at Austin, this was one book I knew I had to use.” —Warren Spector, Creative Director, Junction Point Studios “This is a break-through book, brimming with bale-tested ‘how-to’s.’ Aspiring game designers: you will ‘break through’ to the next level when you learn to set, and then test, experience goals for your game players.” —Bing Gordon, Chief Creative Oﬃcer, Electronic Arts “Game Design Workshop is without a question the most important (and best book) on the topic of game design. Its unique approach is both deep and practical and draws students’ into the very heart of what game design is all about. The emphasis on paper-and-pencil prototyping encourages students to think, quite literally, “outside the box,” and stretch themselves to innovate beyond simply rehashing commercially successful game genres. If the author’s students are any indication, this method has a proven track record of producing both original and successful games. Game Design Workshop is ideal for those starting new educational programs as the book is structured around a design curriculum that can be easily implemented by instructors with no prior game design experience.” —Celia Pearce, Director, Experimental Game Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology “This book oﬀers a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the ﬁeld of game design. I’m particularly impressed with the way Tracy has managed to integrate the viewpoints and comments of so many diverse and notable designers with her own perceptive view of the state of the art.” —Noah Falstein, freelance designer, The Inspiracy “With the second edition of Game Design Workshop, the authors have kept the engaging hand-on exercise-based approach, while giving the text a nice updating and polishing. This book does a great job illustrating how games are designed and developed by engaging readers to play along.” —Drew Davidson, Director, Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University “If you are considering becoming a professional game designer, you will ﬁnd this book a reliable, intelligent, and compassionate guide. If you are already a professional game designer, you’ll ﬁnd this book an inspiration.” —Bernie DeKoven, deepfun.com\n\n“If you have ever wanted to design a video game, Game Design Workshop is the book you want.” —Jesper Juul, video game theorist and designer, author of Half-Real “Tracy Fullerton has combined her innate understanding and joy of games with her patient and objective experience as a scholar in this excellent book. She’ll make you a beer game developer with her clever exercises and concise prose. This is a must-have in the library of anyone serious about their games.” —John Hight, Director of External Production, Sony Computer Entertainment of America “Game design is something of a black art. The trick to doing it well is retaining the black magic but training oneself to control it. There are a lot of books on game design out there, but Game Design Workshop is among the very few that develops a wizard rather than a drone.” —Ian Bogost, professor of digital media, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Co-Founder, Persuasive Games\n\nGAME DESIGN WORKSHOP\n\nThis page intentionally le blank\n\nGAMEDESIGN WORKSHOP A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games Second Edition\n\nTracy Fullerton with Christopher Swain and Steven S.

Every point in my life is connected to every other point. The connection is there. One need only imagine in full freedom. — Peter Handke There is magic in games. Not magic like a Level 19 ﬁreball spell is magic. Not the kind of magic you get when you purchase a trick in a magic store. And not the kind of mystical experience that organized religion can go on about. No, games are magic in the way that ﬁrst kisses are magic, the way that ﬁnally arriving at a perfect solution to a diﬃcult problem is magic, the way that conversation with close friends over good food is magic. The magic at work in games is about ﬁnding hidden connections between things, in exploring the way that the universe of a game is structured. As all game players know, this kind of discovery makes for deeply profound experiences. How is it possible that the simple rules of chess and Go continue to evolve new strategies and styles of play, even aer centuries and centuries of human study? How is it that the nations of the entire world, and even countries at war with each other—at war!—can come together to celebrate in the conflict of sport? How do computer and video games, seemingly so isolating, pierce our individual lives and bring us together in play? To play a game is to realize and reconﬁgure these hidden connections—between units on a game board, between players in a match, between life inside the game and life outside—and in so doing, create new meaning. And if games are spaces where meaning\n\nis made, game designers are the meta-creators of meaning, those who architect the spaces of possibility where such discovery takes place. Which is where this book comes in. You are reading these words because you are interested in not just playing games, but in making them. Take my word for it: Game Design Workshop is one of the very few books that can truly help you to make the games that you want to make. Those games bursting from your heart and from your imagination. The ones that keep you up at night demanding to be designed. Games that are brimming with potential for discovery, for meaning, for magic. Game Design Workshop presents, with sharp intelligence and an eye for the importance of the design process, tried-and-true strategies for thinking about and creating games. More than just fancy notions about how games work, Game Design Workshop is a treasury of methods for puing game design theories into practice. The authors of Game Design Workshop have real experience making games, teaching game designers, and writing about game design. And I can honestly say that they have personally taught me a great deal. In the ambition of its scope and the value of its insights, you hold in your hands a very unique text. Why do we need a book like Game Design Workshop? Because despite the fact that games are so very ancient, are part of every society, and are increasingly important in people’s lives, we hardly know anything about them. We are still learning. What makes games tick? How do we create them? How do they ﬁt into culture at large? The explosion\n\nxiii\n\nxiv Foreword of computer and video games in recent decades has multiplied the complexity and the stakes of such questions. For beer or worse, questions like these don’t have simple answers. And Game Design Workshop won’t give them to you. But it can help you ﬁgure out how to explore them on your own, through the games you design. We are living through the rebirth of an ancient form of human culture. Just as the nineteenth century ushered in mechanical invention, and the twentieth\n\ncentury was the age of information, the twenty-ﬁrst will be a century of play. As game designers, we will be the architects, the storytellers, and the party hosts of this playful new world. What a wonderful and weighty responsibility we have. To bring meaning to the world. To bring magic into the world. To make great games. And to set the world on ﬁre through play. Are you with me?

Jung Games are an integral part of all known human cultures. Digital games, in all their various formats and genres, are just a new expression of this ancient method of social interaction. Creating a good game, as noted in the Jung quote above, is a challenging task, one that requires a playful approach but a systematic solution. Part engineer, part entertainer, part mathematician, and part social director, the role of the game designer is to cra a set of rules within which there are means and motivation to play. Whether we are talking about folk games, board games, arcade games, or massively multiplayer online games, the art of game design has always been to create that elusive combination of challenge, competition, and interaction that players just call “fun.” The cultural impact of digital games has grown to rival television and ﬁlms as the industry has matured over the past three decades. Game industry revenues have been growing at a double-digit rate for years and have recently eclipsed the domestic box oﬃce revenues of the ﬁlm industry, reaching 12.5 billion dollars in 2007. According to reports in Time Magazine and The LA Times, 90% of U.S. households with children have rented or owned a video or computer game, and young people in the United States spend an average of 20 minutes per day playing video games. This makes digital games the second most popular form of entertainment aer television.\n\nAs sales of games have increased, interest in game design as a career path has also escalated. Similar to the explosion of interest in screenwriting and directing that accompanied the growth of the ﬁlm and television industries, creative thinkers today are turning to games as a new form of expression. Degree programs in game design are now available in major universities all over the world in response to student demand. The International Game Developers Association, in recognition of the overwhelming interest in learning to create games, has established an Education SIG to help educators create a curriculum that reﬂects the real-world process of professional game designers. On their website, the IGDA lists over 200 programs that oﬀer game design courses or degrees in North America alone. Furthermore, Game Developer magazine puts out an annual career guide bonus issue to connect the study of game development to the practice of it. In addition to our experience designing games for companies such as Disney, Sony, Sega, and Microso, the authors of this book have spent twelve years teaching the art of game design to students from a variety of diﬀerent backgrounds and experience levels and have established a game design curriculum for the interactive media degrees at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. In this time, we have found that there are paerns in the way that beginning designers grasp the structural elements of games, common traps that they fall into, and certain types of exercises that can help them learn to make beer games. This book encapsulates the experience we have gained by working with our students to design, prototype, and playtest hundreds of original game concepts.\n\nxix\n\nxx Introduction Our students have gone on to jobs in all areas of the game industry, including game design, producing, programming, visual design, marketing, and quality assurance. Several of them have gone on to become prominent independent game designers, such as the team at thatgamecompany, which developed the hit downloadable title ﬂOw from a student research project created at USC. The method we present here has proven to be successful over and over again. Whatever your background, your technical skills, your reasons for wanting to design games, our goal with this book is to enable you to design games that engage and delight your players. Our approach is exercise driven and extremely nontechnical. This may surprise you, but we do not recommend implementing your designs digitally right away. The complexities of soware development oen hamper a designer’s ability to see the structural elements of their system clearly. The exercises contained in this book require no programming expertise or visual art skills and so release you from the intricacies of digital game production while allowing you to learn what works and what does not work in your game system. Additionally, these exercises will teach you the most important skill in the game design: the process of prototyping, playtesting, and revising your system based on player feedback. There are three basic steps to our approach:\n\nStep 1 Start with an understanding of how games work. Learn about rules, procedures, objectives, etc. What is a game? What makes a game compelling to play? Part I of this book covers these game design fundamentals.\n\nStep 2 Learn to conceptualize, prototype, and playtest your original games. Create rough physical or digital prototypes of your designs that allow you to separate the essential system elements from the complexities of full production. Put your playable prototype in the hands of players and conduct playtests that generate useful, actionable feedback. Use that feedback to revise and perfect your game’s design. Part II, starting on page 147, covers these important design skills.\n\nStep 3 Understand the industry and the place of the game designer in it. The ﬁrst two steps give you the foundation of knowledge to be a literate and capable game designer. From there you can pursue the specialized skills used in the game industry. For example, you can pursue producing, programming, art, or marketing. You might become a lead game designer or perhaps one day run a whole company. Part III, starting on page 347 of this book, covers the place of the game designer on a design team and in the industry. The book is full of exercises intended to get you working on game design problems and creating your own designs. When you reach the end, you will have prototyped and playtested many games, and you will have at least one original playable project of your own. We emphasize the importance of doing these exercises because the only way to really become a game designer is to make games, not just play them or read about them. If you think of this book as a tool to lead you through the process of design, and not just a text to read, you will ﬁnd the experience much more valuable. So if you are ready to get started, it’s your turn now. Best of luck!\n\nPart 1\n\nGame Design Basics Since there have been games, there have been game designers. Their names might have been lost to history, but at some point the ﬁrst clay dice were thrown, and the ﬁrst smooth stones were placed in the pits of a newly carved mancala board. These early inventors might not have thought of themselves as game designers—perhaps they were just amusing themselves and their friends by coming up with competitions using the everyday objects around them—but many of their games have been played for thousands of years. And although this history stretches back as far as the beginnings of human culture, when we think of games today, we tend to speak of the digital games that have so recently captured our imaginations. These digital games have the capacity to take us to amazing new worlds with fantastic characters and fully realized interactive environments. Games are designed by teams of professional game developers who work long hours at specialized tasks. The technological and business aspects of these digital games are mind-boggling. And yet, the appeal of digital games for players has its roots in the same basic impulses and desires as the games that have come before them. We play games to learn new skills, to feel a sense of achievement, to interact with friends and family, and sometimes just to pass the time. Ask yourself, why do you play games? Understanding your\n\nown answer, and the answers of other players, is the ﬁrst step to becoming a game designer. We bring up this long history of games as a prelude to a book primarily about designing digital games because we feel that it’s important for today’s designers to “reclaim” that history as inspiration and for examples of what makes great gameplay. It’s important to remember that what has made games such a long-lasting form of human entertainment is not intrinsic to any technology or medium but to the experience of the players. The focus of this book will be on understanding and designing for that player experience, no maer what platform you are working with. It is what we call a “playcentric” approach to game design, and it is the key to designing innovative, emotionally engaging game experiences. In the ﬁrst chapter of this section, we’ll look at the special role played by the game designer throughout the process, the designer’s relationship to the production team, the skills and vision a designer must possess, and the method by which a designer brings players into the process. Then we will look at the essential structure of games—the formal, dramatic, and dynamic elements that a designer must work with to create that all-important player experience. These are the fundamental building blocks of game design, and they provide an understanding of what it takes to create great games.\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Role of the Game Designer The game designer envisions how a game will work during play. She create the objectives, rules, and procedures, thinks up the dramatic premise and gives it life, and is responsible for planning everything necessary to create a compelling player experience. In the same way that an architect dras a blueprint for a building or a screenwriter produces the script for a movie, the game designer plans the structural elements of a system that, when set in motion by the players, creates the interactive experience. As the impact of digital games has increased, there has been an explosion of interest in game design as a career. Now, instead of looking to Hollywood and dreaming of writing the next blockbuster, many creative people are turning to games as a new form of expression.\n\nBut what does it take to be a game designer? What kinds of talents and skills do you need? What will be expected of you during the process? And what is the best method of designing for a game? In this chapter, we’ll look at the answers to these questions and outline a method of iterative design that designers can use to judge the success of gameplay against their goals for the player experience throughout the design and development process. This iterative method, which we call the “playcentric” approach, relies on inviting feedback from players early on and is the key to designing games that delight and engage the audience because the game mechanics are developed from the ground up with the player experience at the center of the process.\n\nAnAdvocateforthePlayer The role of the game designer is, ﬁrst and foremost, to be an advocate for the player. The game designer must look at the world of games through the player’s eyes. This sounds simple, but you’d be surprised how oen this concept is ignored. It’s far too easy to get caught up in a game’s graphics, story line, or new features and forget that what makes a game great is solid gameplay. That’s what excites players. Even if they tell you that they love the special eﬀects, art direction, or plot, they won’t play for long unless the gameplay hooks them.\n\n2\n\nAs a game designer, a large part of your role is to keep your concentration focused on the player experience and not allow yourself to be distracted by the other concerns of production. Let the art director worry about the imagery, the producer stress over the budget, and the technical director futz with the engine. Your main job is to make sure that when the game is delivered, it provides superior gameplay. When you ﬁrst sit down to design a game, everything is fresh, and, most likely, you have a vision for what it is that you want to create. At this point in\n\nAn Advocate for the Player\n\n3\n\nthe process, your view of the game and that of the eventual new player are similar. However, as the process unfolds and the game develops, it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to see your creation objectively. Aer months of testing and tweaking every conceivable aspect, your once clear view can become muddled. At times like this, it’s easy to get too close to your own work and lose perspective.\n\nPlaytesters Situations like these are when it becomes critical to have playtesters. Playtesters are people who play your game and provide feedback on the experience so that you can move forward with a fresh perspective. By watching other people play the game, you can learn a great deal. Observe their experience and try to see the game through their eyes. Pay aention to what objects they are focused on, where they click or move the cursor when they get stuck or frustrated or bored, and write down everything they tell you. They are your guide, and it’s your mission to have them lead you inside the game and illuminate any issues lurking below the surface of the design. If you train yourself to do this, you will regain your objectivity and be able to see both the beauty and the ﬂaws in what you’ve created. Many game designers don’t involve playtesters in their process, or, if they do bring in playtesters, it’s at the end of production when it’s really too late to change the essential elements of the design. Perhaps they are on a tight schedule and feel they don’t have time for feedback. Or perhaps they are afraid that feedback will force them to change things they love about their design. Maybe they think that geing a playtest group together will cost too much money. Or they might be under the impression that testing is something only done by marketing people. What these designers don’t realize is that by divorcing their process from this essential feedback opportunity, they probably cost themselves considerable time, money, and creative heartache. This is because games are not a form of one-way\n\n1.1\n\nPlaytest group\n\ncommunication. Being a superior game designer isn’t about controlling every aspect of the game design or dictating exactly how the game should function. It’s about building a potential experience, seing all the pieces in place so that everything’s ready to unfold when the players begin to participate. In some ways, designing a game is like being the host of a party. As the host, it’s your job to get everything ready—food, drinks, decorations, music to set the mood—and then you open the doors to your guests and see what happens. The results are not always predictable or what you envisioned. A game, like a party, is an interactive experience that is only fully realized aer your guests arrive. What type of party will your game be like? Will your players sit like wallﬂowers in your living room? Will they stumble around trying to ﬁnd the coatroom closet? Or will they laugh and talk and meet new people, hoping the night will never end? Inviting players “over to play” and listening to what they say as they experience your game is the best way to understand how your game is working. Gauging reactions, interpreting silent moments, studying feedback, and matching those with speciﬁc game elements are the keys to becoming a professional designer. When you learn to listen to your players, you can help your game to grow.\n\n4 Chapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer\n\n1.2\n\nIn Chapter 9 on page 248, when we examine the playtesting process in detail, you’ll learn methods and procedures that will help you hold professional quality playtests and make the most of these tests by asking good questions and listening openly to criticism. For now though, it’s just important to know that playtesting is the heart of the design process explored in this book and that the feedback you receive during these sessions can help you transform your game into a truly enjoyable experience for your players. Like any living system, games transform throughout their development cycle. No rule is set in stone. No technique is absolute. No scheme is the right one. If you understand how ﬂuid the structures are, you can help mold them into shape through repeated testing and careful observation. As a game designer, it’s up to you to evolve your game into more than you originally envisioned. That’s the art of game design. It’s not locking things in place; it’s giving birth and parenting. No one, no maer how smart they are, can conceive and produce a sophisticated game from a blank sheet of paper and perfect it without going through this process. And learning how to\n\nMore playtest groups\n\nwork creatively within this process is what this book is all about. Throughout this book, we’ve included exercises that challenge you to practice the skills that are essential to game design. We’ve tried to break them down so that you can master them one by one, but by the end of the book, you will have learned a tremendous amount about games, players, and the design process. And you will have designed, prototyped, and playtested at least one original idea of your own. We recommend creating a folder or notebook of your completed exercises so that you can refer to them as you work your way through the book.\n\nExercise 1.1: Become a Tester Take on the role of a tester. Go play a game and observe yourself as you play. Write down what you’re doing and feeling. Try to create one page of detailed notes on your behaviors and actions. Then repeat this experience while watching a friend play the same game. Compare the two sets of notes and analyze what you’ve learned from the process.\n\nPassions and Skills\n\n5\n\nPassionsandSkills What does it take to become a game designer? There is no one simple answer, no one path to success. There are some basic traits and skills we can mention, however. First, a great game designer is someone who loves to create playful situations. A passion for games and play is the one thread all great designers have in common. If you don’t love what you’re doing, you’ll never be able to put in the long hours necessary to cra truly innovative games. To someone on the outside, making games might seem like a trivial task—something that’s akin to playing around. But it’s not. As any experienced designer can tell you, testing their own game for the thousandth time can become work, not play. As the designer, you have to remain dedicated to that ongoing process. You can’t just go through the motions. You have to keep that passion alive in yourself and in the rest of\n\n1.3\n\nCommunicating with team members\n\nthe team to make sure that the great gameplay you envisioned in those early days of design is still there in the exhausting, pressure-ﬁlled ﬁnal days before you lock production. To do that, you’ll need to develop some other important skills in addition to your love of games and your understanding of the playcentric process.\n\nCommunication The most important skill that you, as a game designer, can develop is the ability to communicate clearly and eﬀectively with all the other people who will be working on your game. You’ll have to “sell” your game many times over before it ever hits the store shelves: to your teammates, management, investors, and perhaps even your friends and family. To accomplish this, you’ll\n\n6\n\nChapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer\n\nneed good language skills, a crystal-clear vision, and a well-conceived presentation. This is the only way to rally everyone involved to your cause and secure the support that you’ll need to move forward. But good communication doesn’t just mean writing and speaking—it also means becoming a good listener and a great compromiser. Listening to your playtesters and to the other people on your team aﬀords fresh ideas and new directions. Listening also involves your teammates in the creative process, giving them a sense of authorship in the ﬁnal design that will reinvest them in their own responsibilities on the project. If you don’t agree with an idea, you haven’t lost anything, and the idea you don’t use might spark one that you do. What happens when you hear something that you don’t want to hear? Perhaps one of the hardest things to do in life is compromise. In fact, many game designers think that compromise is a bad word. But compromise is sometimes necessary, and if done well, it can be an important source of creative collaboration. For example, your vision of the game might include a technical feature that is simply impossible with the time and resources you have available. What if your programmers come up with an alternate implementation for the feature, but it doesn’t capture the essence of the original design? How can you adapt your idea to the practical necessities in such a way as to keep the gameplay intact? You’ll have to compromise. As the designer, it’s your job to ﬁnd a way to do it elegantly and successfully so that the game doesn’t suﬀer.\n\nTeamwork Game production can be one of the most intense, collaborative processes you’ll ever experience. The interesting and challenging thing about game development teams is the sheer breadth of types of people who work on them. From the hardcore computer scientists, who might be designing the AI or graphic displays, to the talented illustrators and animators who bring the characters to life, to the money-minded executives and business managers who deliver the\n\n1.4\n\nTeam meeting\n\ngame to its players, the range of personalities is incredible. As the designer, you will interact with almost all of them, and you will ﬁnd that they all speak different languages and have diﬀerent points of view. Computer-ese doesn’t oen communicate well to artists or the producer, while the subtle shadings of a character sketch might not be instantly obvious to a programmer. A big part of your job, and one of the reasons for your documents and speciﬁcations, is to serve as a sort of universal translator, making sure that all of these diﬀerent groups are, in fact, working on the same game. Throughout this book, we oen refer to the game designer as a single team member, but in many cases the task of game design is a team eﬀort. Whether there is a team of designers on a single game or a collaborative environment where the visual designers, programmers, or producer all have input to the design, the game designer rarely works alone. In Chapter 12 on page 348 we will discuss team structures and how the game designer ﬁts into the complicated puzzle that is a development team.\n\nProcess Being a game designer oen requires working under great pressure. You’ll have to make critical changes to your game without causing new issues in the process. All too oen, a game becomes unbalanced while trying to correct an issue because the designer gets\n\nPassions and Skills too close to the work, and in the hopes of solving one problem, introduces a host of new problems. But, unable to see this mistake, the designer keeps making changes, while the problems grow worse, until the game becomes such a mess that it loses whatever magic it once had. Games are fragile systems, and each element is inextricably linked to the others, so a change in one variable can send disruptive ripples throughout. This is particularly catastrophic in the ﬁnal phases of development, where you run out of time, mistakes are le unﬁxed, and portions of the game are amputated in hopes of saving what’s le. It’s gruesome, but it might help you understand why some games with so much potential seem D.O.A. The one thing that can rescue a game from this terrible fate is instilling good processes in your team from the beginning. Production is a messy business, when ideas can get convoluted and objectives can disappear in the chaos of daily crises. But good process, using the playcentric approach of playtesting, and controlled, iterative changes, which we’ll discuss throughout this book, can help you stay focused on your goals, prioritize what’s truly important, and avoid the pitfalls of an unstructured approach.\n\n7\n\nExercise 1.2: D.O.A. Take one game that you’ve played that was D.O.A. By D.O.A., we mean “dead on arrival” (i.e., a game that’s no fun to play). Write down what you don’t like about it. What did the designers miss out on? How could the game be improved?\n\nInspiration A game designer oen looks at the world diﬀerently from most people. This is in part because of the profession and in part because the art of game design requires someone who is able to see and analyze the underlying relationships and rules of complex systems and to ﬁnd inspiration for play in common interactions. When a game designer looks at the world, he oen sees things in terms of challenges, structures, and play. Games are everywhere, from how we manage our money to how we form relationships. Everyone has goals in life and must overcome obstacles to achieve those goals. And of course, there are rules. If you want to win in the ﬁnancial markets, you have to understand the rules of trading stocks and\n\n1.5\n\nSystems all around us\n\n8 Chapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer bonds, proﬁt forecasts, IPOs, etc. When you play the markets, the act of investing becomes very similar to a game. The same holds true for winning someone’s heart. In courtship, there are social rules that you must follow, and it’s in understanding these rules and how you ﬁt into society that helps you to succeed. If you want to be a game designer, try looking at the world in terms of its underlying systems. Try to analyze how things in your life function. What are the underlying rules? How do the mechanics operate? Are there opportunities for challenge or playfulness? Write down your observations and analyze the relationships. You’ll ﬁnd there is potential for play all around you that can form the inspiration for a game. You can use these observations and inspirations as foundations for building new types of gameplay. Why not look at other games for inspiration? Well, of course, you can and you should. We’ll talk about that in just a minute. But if you want to come up with truly original ideas, then don’t fall back on existing games for all your ideas. Instead, look at the world around you. Some of the things that have inspired other game designers and could inspire you are obvious: personal relationships, buying and selling, competition in the workplace, etc. Take ant colonies, for example. They’re organized around a sophisticated set of rules, and there’s competition both within the colonies and between competing insect groups. Well-known game designer Will Wright made a game about ant colonies in 1991, SimAnt. “I was always fascinated by social insects,” he says. “Ants are one of the few real examples of intelligence we have that we can study and deconstruct. We’re still struggling with the way the human brain works. But if you look at ant colonies, they sometimes exhibit a remarkable degree of intelligence.”1 The game itself was something of a disappointment commercially, but the innate curiosity about how the world works that led Wright to ant colonies has also led him to look at ecological systems such as the Gaia hypothesis as inspiration for SimEarth or psychological theories such as Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as inspiration for artiﬁcial intelligence in The Sims. Having a strong sense of curiosity and a passion for learning about the world is clearly an important part of Wright’s inspiration as a game designer.\n\nWhat inspires you? Examine things that you are passionate about as systems; break them down in terms of objects, behaviors, relationships, etc. Try to understand exactly how each element of the system interacts. This can be the foundation for an interesting game. By practicing the art of extracting and deﬁning the games in all aspects of your life, you will not only hone your skills as a designer, but you’ll open up new vistas in what you imagine a game can be.\n\nExercise 1.3: Your Life as a Game List ﬁve areas of your life that could be games. Then brieﬂy describe a possible underlying game structure for each.\n\nBecoming a Beer Player One way to become an advocate for the player is by being a beer player yourself. By “beer” we don’t just mean more skilled or someone who wins all the time—although by studying game systems in depth, you will undoubtedly become a more skilled player. What we mean is using yourself and your experiences with games to develop an unerring sense for good gameplay. The ﬁrst step to practicing any art form is to develop a deep understanding of what makes that art form work. For example, if you’ve ever studied a musical instrument, you’ve probably learned to hear the relationship between the various musical tones. You’ve developed an ear for music. If you’ve studied drawing or painting, it’s likely that your instructor has urged you to practice looking carefully at light and texture. You’ve developed an eye for visual composition. If you are a writer, you’ve learned to read critically. And if you want to be a game designer, you need to learn to play with the same conscious sensitivity to your own experience and critical analysis of the underlying system that these other arts demand. The following chapters in this section look at the formal, dramatic, and dynamic aspects of games. Together, the concepts in these chapters form a set of tools that you can use to analyze your gameplay experiences and become a beer, or more articulate,\n\nPassions and Skills player and creative thinker. By practicing these skills, you will develop a game literacy that will make you a beer designer. Literacy is the ability to read and write a language, but the concept can also be applied to media or technology. Being game literate means understanding how game systems work, analyzing how they make meaning, and using your understanding to create your own game systems. We recommend writing your analysis in a game journal. Like a dream journal or a diary, a game journal can help you think through experiences you’ve had and also to remember details of your gameplay long aerwards. As a game designer, these are valuable insights that you might otherwise forget. It is important when writing in your game journal to try and think deeply about your game experience—don’t just review the game and talk about its features. Discuss a meaningful moment of gameplay. Try to remember it in detail—why did it strike you? What did you think, feel, do, etc.? What are the underlying mechanics that made the moment work? The dramatic aspects? Perhaps your insights will form the basis for a future design, perhaps not. But, like sketching or practicing scales on a musical instrument, the act of writing and thinking about design will help you to develop your own way of thinking about games, which is critical to becoming a game designer.\n\nExercise 1.4: Game Journal Start a game journal. Try to describe not just the features of the game, but dig deeply into the choices you made, what you thought and felt about those choices, and the underlying game mechanics that support those choices. Go into detail; look for the reasons why various mechanics of the game exist. Analyze why one moment of gameplay stands out and not another. Commit to writing in your game journal every day.\n\nCreativity Creativity is hard to quantify, but you’ll deﬁnitely need to access your creativity to design great games. Everyone is creative in diﬀerent ways. Some people come up with lots of ideas without even trying. Others\n\n9\n\nfocus on one idea and explore all of its possible facets. Some sit quietly in their rooms thinking to themselves, while others like to bounce ideas around with a group and ﬁnd the interaction to be stimulating. Some seek out stimulation or new experiences to spark their imaginations. Great game designers like Will Wright tend to be people who can tap into their dreams and fantasies and bring those to life as interactive experiences. Another great game designer, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto, says that he oen looks to his childhood and to hobbies that he enjoys for inspiration. “When I was a child, I went hiking and found a lake,” he says. “It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to ﬁnd my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this.”2 Many of Miyamoto’s games draw from this sense of exploration and wonder that he remembers from childhood. Think about your own life experiences. Do you have memories that might spark the idea for a game? One reason that childhood can be such a powerful inspiration for game designers is that when we are children, we are particularly engrossed in playing games. If you watch how kids interact on a playground, it’s usually through game playing. They make games and learn social order and group dynamics from their play. Games permeate all aspects of kids’ lives and are a vital part of their developmental process. So if you go back to your childhood and look at things that you enjoyed, you’ll ﬁnd the raw material for games right there.\n\nExercise 1.5: Your Childhood List ten games you played as a child; for example, hide and seek, four square, tag, etc. Brieﬂy describe what was compelling about each of those games. Creativity might also mean puing two things together that don’t seem to be related—like Shakespeare and the Brady Bunch. What can you make of such a strange combination? Well, the designers of You Don’t Know Jack used silly combinations of\n\n10 Chapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer\n\n1.6\n\nYou Don’t Know Jack 1.7\n\nhigh- and low-brow knowledge like this to create a trivia game that challenged players to be equally proﬁcient in both. The result was a hit game with such creative spark that it crossed the usual boundaries of gaming, appealing to players old and young, male and female. Sometimes creative ideas just come to you, and the trick is to know when to stand by a game idea that seems far-fetched. Keita Takahashi, designer of the quirky and innovative hit game Katamari Damacy, was given an assignment while working at Namco to come up with an idea for a racing game. The young artist and sculptor wanted to do something more original than a racing game, however, and says he just “came up with” the idea for the game mechanic of a sticky ball, or katamari, that players could roll around, picking up objects that range from paper clips and sushi to palm trees and policemen. Takahashi has said inspiration for the game came from sources as wildly diﬀerent as the paintings of Pablo Picasso, the novels of John Irving, and Playmobil brand toys, but it is also clear that\n\nBeautiful Katamari and tamakorogashi\n\nTakahashi has been inﬂuenced by Japanese children’s games and sports such as tamakorogashi (ballroller) as a designer and is thinking beyond digital games for his future creations. “I would like to create a playground for children,” he said. “A normal playground is ﬂat but I want an undulating one, with bumps.”3 Our past experiences, our other interests, our relationships, and our identity all come into play when trying to reach our creativity. Great game designers ﬁnd a way to tap into their creative souls and bring forth the best parts in their games. However you do it, whether you work alone or in a team, whether you read books or climb mountains, whether you look to other games for inspiration or to life experiences, the boom line is that there’s no single right way to go about it. Everyone has a diﬀerent style for coming up with ideas and being creative. What maers is not the spark of an idea but what you do with that idea once it emerges, and this is where the playcentric process becomes critical.\n\nAPlaycentricDesignProcess Having a good solid process for developing an idea from the initial concept into a playable and satisfying game experience is another key to thinking like a game designer. The playcentric approach we will illustrate in this book focuses on involving the player in your design process from conception through completion. By that we mean continually keeping the player experience in mind and testing the\n\ngameplay with target players through every phase of development.\n\nSeing Player Experience Goals The sooner you can bring the player into the equation, the beer, and the ﬁrst way to do this is to set “player experience goals.” Player experience goals are just\n\nA Playcentric Design Process what they sound like: goals that the game designer sets for the type of experience that players will have during the game. These are not features of the game but rather descriptions of the interesting and unique situations in which you hope players will ﬁnd themselves. For example, “players will have to cooperate to win, but the game will be structured so they can never trust each other,” “players will feel a sense of happiness and playfulness rather than competitiveness,” or “players will have the freedom to pursue the goals of the game in any order they choose.” Seing player experience goals up front, as a part of your brainstorming process, can also focus your creative process. Notice that these descriptions do not talk about how these experience goals will be implemented in the game. Features will be brainstormed later to meet these goals, and then they will be playtested to see if the player experience goals are being met. At ﬁrst, though, we advise thinking at a very high level about what is interesting and engaging about your game to players while they are playing and what experiences they will describe to their friends later to communicate the high points of the game. Learning how to set interesting and engaging player experience goals means geing inside the heads of the players, not focusing on the features of the game as you intend to design it. When you’re just beginning to design games, one of the hardest things to do is to see beyond features to the actual game experience the players are having. What are they thinking as they make choices in your game? How are they feeling? Are the choices you’ve oﬀered as rich and interesting as they can be?\n\nPrototyping and Playtesting Another key component to playcentric design is that ideas should be prototyped and playtested early. Immediately aer brainstorming ideas, we encourage designers to construct a playable version of their idea. By this we mean a physical prototype of the core game mechanics. A physical prototype can use paper and pen, index cards, or even be acted\n\n11\n\nout. It is meant to be played by the designer and her friends. The goal is to play and perfect this simplistic model before a single programmer, producer, or graphic artist is ever brought onto the project. This way, the game designer receives instant feedback on what players think of the game and can see immediately if they are achieving their player experience goals. This might sound like common sense, but in the industry today, much of the testing of the core game mechanics comes later in the production cycle, which can result in disappointment. Because many games are not thoroughly prototyped or tested early, flaws in the design aren’t found until late in the process—in some cases, too late to fix. People in the industry are realizing that this lack of player feedback means that many games don’t reach their full potential, and the process of developing games needs to change if that problem is to be solved. The work of professional usability experts like Nicole Lazzaro of XEODesign and Bill Fulton and Kevin Keeker of Microsoft (see sidebars in Chapters 9 and 6) is becoming more and more important to game designers and publishers in their attempts to improve game experiences, especially with the new, sometimes inexperienced, game players that are being attracted to platforms like the Nintendo Wii and the DS. You don’t need to have access to a professional test lab to use the playcentric approach. In Chapter 9 we describe a number of methods you can use on your own to produce useful improvements to your game design. We suggest that you do not begin production without a deep understanding of your player experience goals and your core mechanic—the central activity of your game. This is critical because when the production process commences, it becomes increasingly difficult to alter the software design. Therefore, the further along the design and prototyping is before the production begins, the greater the likelihood of avoiding costly mistakes. You can assure that your core design concept is sound before production begins by taking a playcentric approach to the design and development process.\n\n12 Chapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer\n\nDesignersYouShouldKnow The following is a list of designers who have had a monumental impact on digital games. The list was hard to ﬁnalize because so many great individuals have contributed to the cra in so many important ways. The goal was not to be comprehensive but rather to give a taste of some designers who have created foundational works and who it would be good for you, as an aspiring designer yourself, to be familiar with. We’re pleased that many designers on the list contributed interviews and sidebars to this book.\n\nShigeru Miyamoto Miyamoto was hired out of industrial design school by Nintendo in 1977. He was the ﬁrst staﬀ artist at the company. Early in his career he was assigned to a submarine game called Radarscope. This game was like most of the games of the day—simple twitch-game play mechanic, no story, and no characters. He wondered why digital games couldn’t be more like the epic stories and fairy tales that he knew and loved from childhood. He wanted to make adventure stories, and he wanted to add emotion to games. Instead of focusing on Radarscope, he made up his own beauty and the beast-like story where an ape steals his keeper’s girlfriend and runs away. The result was Donkey Kong, and the character that you played was Mario (originally named Jumpman). Mario is perhaps the most enduring character in games and one of the most recognized characters in the world. Each time a new console is introduced by Nintendo—starting with the original NES machine—Miyamoto designs a Mario game as its ﬂagship title. He is famous for the wild creativity and imagination in his games. Aside from all the Mario and Luigi games, Miyamoto’s list of credits is long. It includes the Zelda, Starfox, and Pikmin games.\n\nWill Wright Early in his career, in 1987, Wright created a game called Raid on Bungling Bay. It was a helicopter game where you aacked islands. He had so much fun programming the lile cities on the islands that he decided that making cities was the premise for a fun game. This was the inspiration for SimCity. When he ﬁrst developed SimCity, publishers were not interested because they didn’t believe anyone would buy it. But Wright persisted, and the game became an instant hit. SimCity was a breakout in terms of design in that it was based on creating rather than destroying. Also it didn’t have set goals. These things added some new facets to games. Wright was always interested in simulated reality and has done more than anyone in bringing simulation to the masses. SimCity spawned a whole series of titles including SimEarth, SimAnt, SimCopter, and many others. His game, The Sims, is currently the best-selling game of all time, and Spore, his most ambitious project yet, explores new design territory in terms of user-created content. See “A Conversation with Will Wright by Celia Pearce” on page 136.\n\nSid Meier Legend has it that Sid Meier bet his buddy, Bill Stealey, that within two weeks he could program a beer ﬂying combat game than the one they were playing. Stealey took him up on the oﬀer, and together they founded the company Micro Prose. It took more than two weeks, but the company released the title\n\nDesigners You Should Know\n\n13\n\nSolo Flight in 1984. Considered by many to be the father of PC gaming, Meier went on to create groundbreaking title aer groundbreaking title. His Civilization series has had fundamental inﬂuence on the genre of PC strategy games. His game Sid Meier’s Pirates! was an innovative mix of genres—action, adventure, and roleplaying—that also blended real time and turn-based gaming. His gameplay ideas have been adopted in countless PC games. Meier’s other titles include Colonization, Sid Meier’s Geysburg!, Alpha Centauri, and Silent Serv.\n\nWarren Spector Warren Spector started his career working for board game maker Steve Jackson Games in Austin, Texas. He went from there to the paper-based role-playing game company TSR, where he developed board games and wrote RPG supplements and several novels. In 1989 he was ready to add digital games to his portfolio and moved to the developer Origin Systems. There he worked on the Ultima series with Richard Garrio. Spector had an intense interest in integrating characters and stories into games. He pioneered “free-form” gameplay with a series of innovative titles including Underworld, System Shock, and Thief. His title Deus Ex took the concepts of ﬂexible play and drama in games to new heights and is considered one of the ﬁnest PC games of all time. See his “Designer Perspective” interview on page 23.\n\nRichard Garﬁeld In 1990 Richard Garﬁeld was an unknown mathematician and part-time game designer. He had been trying unsuccessfully to sell a board game prototype called RoboRally to publishers for seven years. When yet another publisher rejected his concept, he was not surprised. However, this time the publisher, a man named Peter Adkison doing business as Wizards of the Coast, asked for a portable card game that was playable in under an hour. Garﬁeld took the challenge and developed a dueling game system where each card in the system could aﬀect the rules in diﬀerent ways. It was a breakthrough in game design because the system was inﬁnitely expandable. The game was Magic: The Gathering, and it single handedly spawned the industry of collectible card games. Magic has been released in digital format in multiple titles. When Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in 1995 for $325 million, Garﬁeld owned a signiﬁcant portion of the company. See his article, “The Design Evolution of Magic: The Gathering,” on page 191.\n\nPeter Molyneux The story goes that it all started with an anthill. Peter Molyneux as a child toyed with one—tearing it down in parts and watching the ants ﬁght to rebuild, dropping food into the world and watching the ants appropriate it, etc. He was fascinated by the power he had over the tiny, unpredictable creatures. Molyneux went on to become a programmer and game designer and eventually the pioneer of digital “god games.” In his breakout title Populous you act as a deity lording over tiny selers. The game was revolutionary in that it was a strategy game that took place in real time, as opposed to in turns, and you had indirect control over your units. The units had minds of their own. This game and other Molyneux hits had profound inﬂuence on the real-time strategy (RTS) games to come. Other titles he has created include Syndicate, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper, and Black & White. See Molyneux’s “Designer Perspective” interview on page 22.\n\n14 Chapter 1: The Role of the Game Designer\n\nGary Gygax In the early 1970s Gary Gygax was an insurance underwriter in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. He loved all kinds of games, including tabletop war games. In these games players controlled large armies of miniatures, acting like generals. Gygax and his friends had fun acting out the personas of diﬀerent pieces on the baleﬁeld such as commanders, heroes, etc. He followed his inclination of what was fun and created a system for baling small parties of miniatures in a game he called Chainmail. From there players wanted even more control of and more character information about the individual units. They wanted to play the role of single characters. Gygax, in conjunction with game designer Dave Arneson, developed an elaborate system for role-playing characters that was eventually named Dungeons & Dragons. The D&D game system is the direct ancestor of every paper-based and digital role-playing game since then. The system is directly evident in all of today’s RPGs including Diablo, Baldur’s Gate, and World of Warcra.\n\nRichard Garrio Richard Garrio—aka “Lord British”—programmed his ﬁrst game right out of high school in 1979. It was an RPG called Akalabeth. He sold it on his own through a local computer store in Austin, Texas. The packaging for this ﬁrst version was a Ziploc bag. Akalabeth later got picked up by a publisher and sold well. Garrio used what he learned to create Ultima, and thus one of the most famous game series of all time began. The Ultima titles evolved over the years—each successive one pushing the envelope in terms of both technology and gameplay—eventually bringing the world of the game online. Ultima Online, released in 1997, was a pioneering title in massively multiplayer online worlds. Garrio continues to push the boundaries of online gaming with work on the science ﬁction MMO Tabula Rasa.\n\nIteration By “iteration” we simply mean that you design, test, and evaluate the results over and over again throughout the development of your game, each time improving upon the gameplay or features, until the player experience meets your criteria. Iteration is deeply important to the playcentric process. Figure 1.8 shows a detailed ﬂow of the iterative process that you should go through when designing a game: · Player experience goals are set. · An idea or system is conceived. · An idea or system is formalized (i.e., wrien down or prototyped). · An idea or system is tested against player experience goals (i.e., playtested or exhibited for feedback). · Results are evaluated and prioritized.\n\n· If results are negative and the idea or system appears to be fundamentally ﬂawed, go back to the ﬁrst step. · If results point to improvements, modify and test again. · If results are positive and the idea or system appears to be successful, the iterative process has been completed. As you will see, we will apply this process during almost every aspect of game design, from the initial conception through the ﬁnal quality assurance testing.\n\nStep 1: Brainstorming · Set player experience goals. · Come up with game concepts or mechanics that you think might achieve your player experience goals.\n\nA Playcentric Design Process\n\n15\n\nor gain feedback from your funding sources and work on modifying the game to ﬁt their needs. Because you have not yet invested in extensive artwork or programming, your costs so far should be prey reasonable, and you should have a great deal of ﬂexibility to make any changes.\n\nStep 4: Soware Prototype(s)\n\n1.8\n\nIterative process diagram\n\n· Narrow down the list to the top three. · Write up a short, one-page description each of these ideas, sometimes called a treatment or concept document. · Test your wrien concepts with potential players (you might also want to create rough visual mockups of your ideas at this stage to help communicate the ideas).\n\nStep 2: Physical Prototype · Create a playable prototype using pen and paper or other cra materials. · Playtest the physical prototype using the process described in Chapters 7 and 9. · When the physical prototype demonstrates working gameplay that achieves your player experience goals, write a three- to six-page gameplay treatment describing how the game functions.\n\nStep 3: Presentation (Optional) · A presentation is oen made to secure funds to hire the prototyping team. Even if you do not require funding, going through the exercise of creating a full presentation is a good way to think through your game and introduce it to the team members and upper management for feedback. · Your presentation should include demo artwork and a solid gameplay treatment. · If you do not secure funding, you can either return to Step 1 and start over again on a new concept\n\n· When you have your prototyping team in place, you can begin creating rough computer models of the core gameplay. Oen there are several soware prototypes made, each focusing on different aspects of the system. Digital prototyping is discussed in Chapter 8 beginning on page 213. (If possible, try to do this entirely with temporary graphics that cost very lile to make. This will save time and money and make the process go faster.) · Playtest the soware prototype(s) using the process described in Chapter 9. · When the soware prototype(s) demonstrate working gameplay that achieves your player experience goals, move on to the documentation step.\n\nStep 5: Design Documentation · While you have been prototyping and working on your gameplay, you have probably been compiling notes "
