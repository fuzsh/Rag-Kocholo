        "text": "Welcome to IGN's 2007 Year in Review for the Sony PlayStation Portable, otherwise known as the PSP. Over the next seven pages we're going to cover the highest highs and lowest lows, the biggest news and highest reviews of 2007. We're going to look back at the year's events, like E3, GDC and TGS, and see how well (or how little) Sony pushed the system. You'll find a list of the year's highest rated titles as determined by both the IGN editors and our readers. We'll break down the biggest news of the year and provide a few tips and tricks on the hottest games. And finally, we'll take a look at 2008 and see what's in store for Sony's little black system.\n\nSo sit back, pour yourself a nice beverage and have a read.\n\nState of the Platform\n\nHow'd the PSP do this year? In short, pretty well. There was the price drop from $199.99 to $169.99, the PSP Slim -- 33 percent lighter and 20 percent slimmer -- arrived in three different packages/colors, sales jumped and a plethora of titles stormed the system's UMD drive.\n\nIn fact of the dozens upon dozens of PSP games that were released and that IGN reviewed in 2007, 25 of those games ranked in as at least \"Impressive\" on our scale. That's a hell of a lot to play if Santa/Hanukah Harry/etc. slips you a Slim this holiday. The exploits of Gabe Logan make Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow an amazing experience, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness brought some flair the RPG scene, Medal of Honor Heroes 2 kept capping fools, Crush warped our impression of a PSP puzzler, Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters brought the crazy weapons, Dead Head Fred made zombies funny again and Jeanne d'Arc made waves by re-imagining the Joan of Arc story with monsters and strategic gameplay.\n\nThere's been football, soccer, pirates, kick ass infrastructure multiplayer, worms, monsters and more on Sony's system, and the fans have welcomed it all with open UMD drives.\n\nBut the PSP was never meant to be just about games. Although the downward spiral of the UMD movie continued in 2007, we did see more and more people using their handheld as a true multimedia device -- aside from your vids that are now compatible in a number of different formats and your MP3 collection -- you can now listen to Internet radio on the PSP. While it's true that the system can do so much more (we'll get to that in our Glimpse of 2008), it's nice to see Sony talking steps toward the PSP's true potential.\n\nIf you have a PlayStation 3, the utility of the PSP only gets better. Remote Play allows you to sync up your home console with the portable and then access your PS3 from anywhere that has WiFi. At first the move seemed like a novelty for showing off a photo or checking out the occasional compatible game, but with a recent round of firmware updates, you can now play any PS One game that is inside the PS3. Finally, the original Metal Gear Solid is on the PSP!\n\nWith the Slim's debut came something the PSP has desperately needed for years -- a viable ad campaign. The \"Dude, get your own\" ads pushed the games of the PSP to the forefront of the public mindset in a way the stupid talking squirrels and the vague memory stick clues of the past just couldn't. If Michael Strahan's playing it, it's got to be awesome.\n\nCould the PSP have had a better year? Of course -- although there was a ton of great software, nasty rumors of the opposite continued to swirl in the industry; we're still getting the short end of the peripherals stick; the Slim could've done more; and the PS3 is clearly the company's No. 1 priority -- but for the faithful, it's been a very, very good year.\n\nGames of 2007\n\nPSP owners have had some good games to play this year, so let's spend a few moments looking at the top ten rated PSP games of 2007. Keep your PSPs at the ready.\n\nSyphon Filter: Logan's Shadow\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nIGN Rating: 9.5\n\nA white-knuckle experience from start to finish, Logan's Shadow continues the impressive line of Syphon Filter games with another bullet-ridden adventure of Gabe Logan. This particular title is filled with suspicion and betrayal as Logan's partner Lian Xing is accused of defecting from the Agency. Logan's Shadow features great gunplay battles and intense missions, with an online multiplayer mode to enjoy when you're not trying to go in alone. Gamers definitely need to give this one a shot -- it's one of the finest shooters available for the PSP and it's sure to entertain.\n\nDisgaea: Afternoon of Darkness\n\nNIS\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nIf you happened to miss the insanely deep experience that the original Disgaea offered, now's your chance to go back and fill the shoes of Price Laharl and the indisputably charming Etna. Afternoon of Darkness is a remake of Disgaea which debuted on the PlayStation 2. Filled with mind-numbingly complex strategy and level-building, many gamers were won over by NIS's unique sense of humor. All that fun is back again, and this time you can play Disgaea with a friend through a few multiplayer modes, as well as undertake a brand new story from the perspective of Etna. This one will last you for a very long time.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions\n\nSquare Enix\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nMany gamers were surprised at how complex and tense the storyline was in the original Final Fantasy Tactics, but the resoundingly political plot and class-based combat helped Tactics become a true Final Fantasy classic. Now, PSP owners can enjoy a revitalized version of the incredible hit, which now features multiplayer competitions, more classes, brand new, beautifully drawn cutscenes and even voiced dialogue. War of the Lions serves as excellent proof that even amazing games can be further improved upon, so grab a copy of Tactics if you haven't already -- it's not only entertaining but moving as well.\n\nJeanne d'Arc\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nMany of us are familiar with the story of Jeanne d'Arc. A young girl living in the French countryside during the Hundred Years War experiences divine visions and is inspired to drive the English out of her homeland. This story is once again retold in Jeanne d'Arc for the PSP (although it's much more fantastical than historical), and it's an excellent strategy game that places you in control of the young French heroine and her courageous companions. Featuring anime-style cutscenes and satisfying customization, Jeanne d'Arc is sure to please, so make sure to add it to your collection if it's not there already.\n\nSid Meier's Pirates!\n\nTake-Two Interactive\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nAnother remake of an absolutely classic game, this PSP version of Pirates! was a great port and captured all the fun of the original. If you never played Pirates! before, you're looking at one of the most open-ended sandbox style games ever made. At the same time, you might consider this title to be a compliation of mini-games, including ship battles and sword fights. All of these various pirate-related activities work great on the PSP and it's a real blast to have a portable version of such a classic. If Pirates! has passed you by before, don't let it happen again.\n\nPuzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords\n\nD3 Publisher\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nA lot of people thought that joining traditional RPG elements with a puzzle game wouldn't work very well, but Puzzle Quest proved that the two genres blend together nicely and create a fun and addictive experience. You can create a character from a roster of different classes and embark upon quests, but as soon as you enter the fray of battle, that's where things get interesting. Using a classic Bejeweled-style field, you and your opponent use puzzles to fight. The result is a unique and engaging title that everyone should try.\n\nRatchet and Clank: Size Matters\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nIGN Rating: 9.0\n\nFans of the Ratchet series won't be the only ones who will enjoy this portable, action-packed romp through space. Size Matters manages to take the entire Ratchet and Clank experience and optimize it for the PSP, making for a sleek, visually appealing game that still has all the zany weapons you expect from the franchise. With the ability to upgrade your arsenal and play through a bunch of mini-games, Size Matters has a lot to offer and is presented very well. High Impact Games did a fantastic job maintaining Insomniac's high level of quality. It's a great addition to the PSP's library.\n\nCrush\n\nSEGA\n\nIGN Rating: 8.9\n\nIt's always refreshing to see an innovative title, and that's exactly what Crush is. A mind-bending puzzle game that requires you to distort 2D to 3D, Crush boasts a fantastic style, amusing storyline and great production values on top of its already inventive and entertaining gameplay mechanics. With four environments and over 40 levels to unravel with your mind, you'll be kept busy for quite a while, especially considering the bonus content to unlock. Even though this isn't a perfect puzzler, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, making it a must-own title for 2007.\n\nBurnout Dominator\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nIGN Rating: 8.5\n\nBurnout Dominator is a fast, extremely tight arcade racer that Burnout fans should not miss. We were really impressed with how smoothly the game ran on the PSP, and how close it looked to its PS2 counterpart. With gameplay more reminiscent of the older Burnout games, Dominator puts a heavy emphasis on racing -- and to great effect. This game never slows down and encourages you to keep on the boost throughout, while featuring tracks that highlight really long drifts. With six-player Ad-Hoc to compliment the single-player experience, Dominator is truly a proud member of the Burnout family.\n\nSyphon Filter: Combat Ops\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nIGN Rating: 8.5\n\nAvailable on the PC PlayStation Store, Combat Ops is a great, expanded version of the multiplayer dynamic found in Logan's Shadow. The beauty of Combat Ops comes from the customizable arenas that you can set up and adjust level location, weather effects, mission types, spawn points, turret location, etc. The options are limited, but they're still abundant and you can share your creations with other players through an impressive online infrastructure. The combat of the title feels like its single-player brethren, which is definitely a good thing, and Combat Ops is a great example of how to do online multiplayer on the PSP right. For such a reasonable price, Syphon Filter fans shouldn't miss it.\n\nMLB '07: The Show\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nMadden NFL 08\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nRatchet & Clank: Size Matters\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\nTransformers: The Game\n\nActivision\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions\n\nSquare Enix\n\n300: March to Glory\n\nWarner Bros.

The previous three entries in the series had all made their debut exclusively on the PlayStation 2. Sony fans were outraged that they would have to share one of their system's most anticipated games with the competition.\n\nWhy it was important: Solid, exclusive software sells systems. For consumers who were debating whether to buy a PS3 or 360, the loss of DMC4 exclusivity meant one less reason to pick up Sony's expensive console. The reality is that Capcom's decision reflects a change in publishers' strategy. Games are expensive, risky undertakings, and companies need to make sure they can get their products in the hands of as many gamers as possible. Going forward, we're likely to see fewer and fewer exclusives. If Sony really wanted to keep DMC4 to itself, it should have made the deal sweet enough for Capcom.\n\nPSP Redesign\n\nWhat happened: During the Game Developers Conference in March, Sony said it had no intention of redesigning the PSP. But by E3 it was ready to confirm gamers' suspicions by unveiling a new version that, while cosmetically similar, was 33 percent lighter, 20 percent thinner, and added a host of upgrades.\n\nWhy it was important: After months of redesign rumors, many fans were left unimpressed with the PSP slim. Some had expected a complete overhaul like the DS had received when it went Lite. Still, sales went up, and the PSP is doing better than ever.\n\nHome Announced\n\nWhat happened: At GDC, Sony gave everyone their first glimpse of home sweet Home. Sort of a Second Life for the PlayStation Network, the service aims to offer many of the community features found on Xbox Live and the Wii -- and surpass them. Users get their own Mii-like avatar to represent themselves in Home's Virtual space, and there is an achievement-type system that awards players with trophies for accomplishing specific tasks.\n\nWhy it was important: Home is incredibly ambitious -- which is why it was delayed from a year-end release to spring 2008. The service has the potential to significantly up the ante for what modern gamers can do with their consoles. The achievement system on the 360 has been enormously popular. Rather than merely duplicating it, Sony appears to be trying to take that concept to a whole new level. If it is successful, Microsoft could find itself the one playing catch-up.\n\nLittleBigPlanet\n\nWhat happened: Developer Media Molecule announced back in September 2006 that it was working on an original and innovative PS3 title. At GDC this year, we received confirmation that the game, LittleBigPlanet, was indeed both of those things. Built around the idea of user-generated content, LBP is set to unleash players' creativity like few other games can.\n\nWhy it is important: Sony is using the high concept of user-generated content to differentiate its console from the competition. So far, it's only delivered promises. But our play time with LittleBigPlanet indicates Sony will make good on those promises this spring.\n\nPrice Drops, New SKUs\n\nWhat happened: Early in July, leaked retail ads claimed the PS3 would shortly be receiving a $100 price drop. Sony denied the cut, but then confirmed it right before E3. Another Benjamin was carved off the system in October, although this new model sacrificed backwards compatibility.\n\nWhy it was important: The high cost of entry to the PS3 was initially one of the biggest drawbacks to the system. In order to win over more casual, mainstream consumers, the price had to come down. What's interesting is the cuts came just eight months into the system's life span. In comparison, the Xbox 360 held at its launch price for over a year and a half. While falling PS3 prices are good for future consumers, early adopters might understandably be upset.\n\nSony's latest had a rough first year, but now it and the 360 are evenly priced. With some great games currently available and huge titles set for next year, the PS3 can head into 2008 with confidence.\n\nPeople in the News\n\nCory Barlog – The God of War II director left Sony's Santa Monica studios in November. His departure means we don't know who is handling the third installment in the series. Part two turned out great, though, without original director David Jaffe, so there is hope.\n\nPhil Harrison – Sony's Chief of Worldwide Studios has made many appearances this year championing the PS3, but also the future of gaming in general. His response to the negative media attention his new system received early in the year? \"I couldn't care less.\" During his GDC keynote speech he introduced his idea of Gaming 3.0, which foresees a future in which consoles are more connected and user-generated content fuels our games. Sony fans were able to rest a little easier this year knowing they had Harrison in their corner.\n\nEvents of 2007\n\nWith the PS3 out -- and taking it on the chin for most of the year -- and a new PSP on the way, Sony brought the thunder to events in 2007. A ton of games, announcements and a greater sense of connectivity had the handheld making its move in the industry.\n\nGame Developers Conference\n\nIf there was one thing Sony did this year, it was rock the Game Developers Conference in March. The company announced Home, LittleBigPlanet and a wealth of other newsworthy tidbits. And what did they say about the PSP?\n\nA representative commented that a PSP redesign wasn't in the cards. Riiiiiiiiight..\n\nSony's Spring Gamer's Day\n\nWhen Sony opened up its exclusive hands-on day in California, more than 40 games were suddenly available for members of the gaming press to salivate over and proceed to devour. Sure, a lot of attention was paid to the PS3's big titles, but the PSP was far from forgotten. Sony's Gamer's Day gave us our first look at Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice, Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, Star Wars: Renegade Squadron, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes, NBA '08 and God of War: Chains of Olympus. E3\n\nAfter months of speculation, Sony CEO Jack Tretton took the stage at his company's E3 press conference with a surprise in his pants -- the PSP Slim. Lighter, skinnier, brighter and packing more battery life than ever, the Slim debuted in three different versions -- piano black, the white Star Wars edition and the Ice Silver system/Daxter pack. Echochrome debuted, we got our first look at Hellboy: The Science of Evil and a bunch of other things happened that made us hug our memory sticks extra hard that night. German Games Convention\n\nIf you were a North American member of the press at the German Games Convention, the PSP news for you was games, games and games. Part of Sony's gigantic floor display was a swatch of Astroturf with beach chairs on top huddled around more PSPs than most people have probably seen in a lifetime. If you went to Leipzig, you could play wipEout Pulse, Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, Silent Hill Origins and more. However, the big news was just for Europe -- PSPs over the pond were getting two new paint jobs, a voice/video messenger service, a GPS utility and a video download service.\n\nIf only we had a queen!\n\nTokyo Game Show\n\nIn the Land of the Rising Sun, we got more of what we love on the PSP channel -- games. We saw Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII in action, learned about Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep and got some hands-on time with Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops +. The biggest news for the Sony portable: Secret Agent Clank. Out of the blue we learned Ratchet's buddy was getting his own PSP title, and we nearly lost our minds.\n\nHot Game Tips of 2007\n\nAs the year 2007 comes to a close, we look back fondly at all of the games that had us cursing like sailors and throwing our controllers in obscene rage. There's nothing quite like finally showing a game who's boss, stickin' it to the virtual man, and IGN's Guides and reader-submitted FAQs and Cheats made that triumph more possible throughout the past twelve months. Here's our recap of the year's most popular videogame wisdom.\n\nLara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary\n\nCheats | FAQs | Guide\n\nBack before the widespread use of the Internet, there was a little game from Core Design featuring a rough and tumble heroine by the name of Lara Croft. Fast forward over a decade later, and the original Tomb Raider gets an impressive overhaul in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary.\n\nAlthough not present in the first game, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary holds some of the franchise's most deviously hidden relics and secret artifacts. While you may scoff at archaeology, you want to grab all those hidden items because they unlock new costumes and in-game cheats for Lara (infinite ammunition and the like). Check out our free guide and complete Ms. Croft's collection.\n\nCastlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles\n\nCheats | FAQs | Guide\n\nIt's been a long time since a Castlevania game busted our balls like The Dracula X Chronicles. The ruthless enemies and precarious stage design make death a frequent (if not constant) reminder of what games used to be, before we grew soft.\n\nMaking matters more challenging are the multiple stage branches and alternate levels. Fortunately, our guide has each stage covered top-to-bottom. It also details how to save the game's maidens to get the true ending, and how to unlock two Castlevania classics for full play, Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood.\n\nAnd for the desperate (yours truly), we've got cheats for Symphony of the Night. Fun fact: Alucard can keep all his gear at the beginning of the stage that he usually loses to Death. Just double-back out of the room with Death before Death actually appears. When you continue east through the room, Death won't appear and he won't steal your goods.\n\nManhunt 2\n\nCheats | FAQs | Guide\n\nNothing surrounds Rockstar games like controversy. Whether it's Grand Theft Auto, Bully, or State of Emergency, Rockstar games bring with them a sense of adult appeal that can't be found with any other company's products. Amongst those controversial series is one known as Manhunt. The second game in the series, Manhunt 2 has proven to be popular and its adult appeal remains relatively unquestioned.\n\nFor those that are fortunate enough to have their hands on the game, our complete, detailed guide will help you out of the stickiest of situations. Each primary mission in the game is covered, and we even have a full list of weapons that outline each gory, gruesome death.\n\nWe've been bruised and battered by 2007's final rush of games, but we're already licking our wounds, eager to crack skulls with next year's releases. Join our fight against unbeatable games and submit your own cheats, hints and walkthroughs and FAQs. Gamers helping gamers—it's a beautiful thing.\n\nMidterm Corrections\n\nAh, remember July? A gallon of gas only cost a nickel, Nixon was in office and Jamie Lynn Spears did not yet know the touch of a man. Oh. E3 happened, too, and we were there to cover the hell out of it.\n\nBesides just seeing a bunch of games and writing impressions for you, we judged them in our annual E3 awards. Now that we're wrapping up 2007, this is where we like to look back and say \"We told you so!\" or \"Clements must've written that one!\"\n\nSo, ready to get this on?\n\nWhat was our best PSP action game of E3? God of War: Chains of Olympus. How'd it stack up? Well, it isn't out yet so it's kind of hard to say. Luckily, a demo has made it to the masses, and anyone who has played it can tell you it's one hell of a ride. However, if you want an awesome action title that you can walk into a store and buy now, Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters and Dead Head Fred are more than happy to help you out.\n\nJiminy Christmas! Did any of our award winners come out this year? We gave wipEout Pulse the PSP's best racing game of E3. Do we regret it? We have no idea because the game isn't out here.\n\nIn the summer, we said Jeanne d'Arc was the PSP's best RPG/strategy game at E3. Now that the game is out, we can tell you that decision hasn't changed. Don't get us wrong, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness ended up being a fantastic strategy game, but from what we saw at E3 and eventually played on our PSPs -- an enthralling re-imagining of the Joan of Arc saga, fun gameplay and tons of depth -- put Jeanne d'Arc out on top.\n\nHere comes God of War: Chains of Olympus again; this time we gave it the nod for having the best PSP graphics at the show. How do we feel know that we're removed from the craziness of LA? In short, good. Again, the game isn't out, but the demo looked good. If you need a winner you can play from 2007, we'd suggest you look at the silky smooth visuals in Ratchet and Clank: Size matters and the gritty scenes of Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow.\n\nReally? God of War: Chains of Olympus again? Yup -- best PSP artistic design at E3. Sure, the demo looks stylized and everyone jazzed about the UMD's release, but it's not out. We stand by our words, but still love Crush, Jeanne d'Arc and more from this year's calendar.\n\nHey, it's a game that actually came out this year! At E3, we said SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Tactical Strike was the system's best multiplayer experience. That one didn't really come together. Don't get us wrong, the multiplayer aspects of the title are still solid, but issues with dummy AI and a broken movement skimmer held the experience back.\n\nThe best non-playable PSP presentation at E3 was Echochrome. This game didn't come out this year, but when you're talking about a non-playable presentation, that doesn't matter. This game -- with its perspective-shifting gameplay, stylized visuals and challenging gameplay -- has us super-excited. Still. That's a good non-playable presentation.\n\nOur biggest PSP surprise of E3 should be obvious -- the PSP Slim looked pretty much exactly the same as the old PSP. The sleeker look, better battery life and everything else is nice, but what the hell? For months people had speculated on another analog stick, bigger screen and all sorts of crazy stuff, but when Jack pulled the Slim from his pants, he actually had to tell us this wasn't an old PSP. Yikes.\n\nAnd -- as if you couldn't have guessed it -- God of War: Chains of Olympus brought home our award for the best PSP game of E3 2007. The portable adventure of Kratos has everyone's attention and it definitely set the bar high at E3. Do we stand by our decision? Yes, the game rocked and it was at E3, so there.\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\n\nRelease: 03/25/08\n\nGod of War: Chains of Olympus\n\nRelease: 03/08\n\nKingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep\n\nRelease: TBA\n\nSecret Agent Clank\n\nRelease: TBA 08\n\nStar Ocean: First Departure\n\nRelease: TBA\n\nA Glimpse at 2008\n\nEven Sony naysayers have to be excited about the PSP's 2008.\n\nTo begin with, the recent launch of the PC PlayStation Store has demonstrated that Sony is looking to bring the PSP into the PlayStation Network. That's a great thing. It might not sound like much, but the previous insistence on only allowing gamers to access the store through the PlayStation 3 was at best frustrating and at worst alienating. Now that PSP fans can download worthwhile -- Castlevania: Symphony of the Night -- and exclusive -- Syphon Filter: Combat Ops -- content, there's a reason to be excited about the store the possibilities it contains. Maybe new themes, videos and programs will open the eyes of the general consumer to all the cool stuff the PSP can do.\n\nHowever, capitalizing on possibilities like these is something Sony has yet to show that they can do -- at least in a timely fashion. Although the addition of Remote Play and Internet Radio are welcome, the masses are still crying for more -- and they've been doing so for quite sometime. UMD movies are dead, but we've seen no sign of downloadable flicks on the Network. Why not let us download flicks straight to our sticks? Europe is getting all sorts of nifty goodies -- video service, GPS and video chat -- but there's no sign of that stuff coming to the United States and we're still waiting on the PSP EyeToy. Japan has some insane number of PS One classics available for download, but we only have a handful.\n\nAnd where the hell is Gran Turismo 4 Mobile?!\n\nBut don't let our griping fool you, there are plenty of games to get you all hot and bothered in 2008. With the most recent round of firmware updates, the PSP can now play PS One discs that have been left in a PS3 via Remote Play. It's a mouthful and it's kind of laggy right now, but if Sony continues to expand the relationship between the PS3 and PSP, the sky's the limit on what you could be doing when you're away from your TV. On the physical game side, the hits are coming: Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice is set for January, God of War: Chains of Olympus is coming in March, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is heading our way after that, there'll be LEGO Indiana Jones: The Videogame, Echochrome and probably a ton of cool stuff we haven't even heard about yet.\n\nSo, start charging your battery and praying to the PSP gods for new peripherals. You've got a big year in front of you.\n\nPC 2007 Year in Review\n\nDan, Steve, and Charles give you the rundown on the world's most venerable gaming platform.\n\n2007 Year in Review: PS2 | PSP | PS3\n\nChris, Greg, Jeff and Ryan take care of PlayStation's double-oh-seven.\n\n2007 Xbox 360 Year in Review\n\nHil, Erik and Nate recap the year that brought us Halo 3.\n\nWii 2007 Year in Review\n\nMatt and Mark discuss 2007's Nintendos and Nintendon'ts.\n\nNintendo DS 2007 Year in Review\n\nCraig breaks the year down for the dual-screen portable.\n\nWireless 2007 Year in Review\n\nBefore 2008 rings in, Levi shows us what was up on cell phones in 2007.\n\n<!--"
