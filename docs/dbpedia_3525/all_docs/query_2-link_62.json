        "text": "The combination of slow motion and the amount of destruction you cause is very difficult to not enjoy.\n\nI’m in the middle of playing Burnout Revenge, but I think I’ve put in enough hours to write up a review for it. I think it’s going to take several more hours to get all the Achievements I’m after, but unlike other games, this one doesn’t have a strong storyline or plot that requires me to get through the game to write up my thoughts.\n\nThis is one of those rare games that I had never planned to give the light of day, but through circumstances, I played it and realized, “Wow this game is great! I’m quite happy that I got a chance to play this.” (The only other game I can think of that was a pleasant surprise for me was Dark Cloud 2 on the PS2.) My brother had given me this game along with some other stuff for Christmas last year, and I never got around to it until recently when I was considering trading it in during the Gamestop trade-in promotions.\n\nIntro\n\nBurnout Revenge is the 4th game in the Burnout series, and my first entry into the series. It was originally released on the PS2 and Xbox in September of 2005, and a 360 version was released in March of 2006. The 360 version was redone quite well to take advantage of not only the Xbox 360’s graphics capabilities, but its online Live infrastructure.\n\nBurnout Revenge is the 7th highest scoring game on the 360, according to GameRankings:\n\n1. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion 94.1%\n\n2. Gears of War 93.8%\n\n3. Guitar Hero II 92.6%\n\n4. Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 90.7%\n\n5. Call of Duty 2 90.0%\n\n6. Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Vegas 88.9%\n\n7. Burnout Revenge X360 88.8%\n\nIt’s the best racing game out on the 360, and highly recommended to racing and non-racing game fans alike.\n\nI personally never cared much for racing games. I’d spent enough time trying to enjoy Gran Turismo when I was younger to realize that I’m just not into cars. I don’t care about installing a new engine to raise the horsepower a bit, figuring out a way to corner a certain turn on a race track, etc. Those types of racing game fans probably have a lot of patience to play such games. Besides the repetitive nature of racing games (driving around a track with no sense of storyline), you also have to worry about damaging your car so you avoid touching anything else with it.\n\nGranted, there are some racing games out there such as Ridge Racer and Project Gotham Racing that are slightly more arcade-like in their game dynamics and feel, but they still play like a racing simulator. For those of you that are not into racing simulators either, I’ll explain why Burnout Revenge is not just for you, but for anyone that has experience driving.\n\nAlthough rare, it is possible to completely demolish your car and lose the race this way – but it only happens if you crash an obscene amount of times and your car starts to look this bad.\n\nStoryline and Premise\n\nThere isn’t a real story to Burnout Revenge – but the premise is simple: a realistic battle racer not unlike Mario Kart. In this game, not only are you trying to place first, you’re also inclined to smash your opponents’ cars and are rewarded for driving aggressively – two concepts that you should not be doing in real life driving. That’s one of the reasons why this game is so fun: it recreates all the violence and destruction that causes rubber necking on the highway right there on your TV, with you in control!\n\nThe graphics are truly next-gen as Criterion Games did a wonderful job with that. The sound is effective and the music is supposed to be good, but I went ahead and listened to my own MP3s. I prefer trance when driving so the included music tracks were just not my style.\n\nThe single player revolves around World Tour, which requires you to move from the bottom rank to the 10th rank. Each rank has its own races and activities that you must perform to gain points. The more aggressive you drive and the higher the spot you come in for a race or time trial, the higher the number of points you get. The highest number of rank points awarded for an activity is 5 points (usually the most aggressive driving and placing first in a race) and it takes maybe 50 to 60 points to rank up.\n\nOne of the tracks in the game takes you through the busy streets of Hong Kong.\n\nIn each rank the following activity types are played across 8 different tracks (half of them are American locales while the other four are from Europe and Asia):\n\nRACE: Regular race against 5 other computer opponents.\n\nROAD RAGE: cause a certain number of computer opponents to crash in order to clear. Generally, you are given one minute to take down 3 computer opponents to get a one minute extension. To earn gold for the stage usually requires between 12-15 takedowns.\n\nCRASH: Crash your car and cause the most possible damage in a busy intersection. This mode is fun because it’s a departure from racing – it’s a set piece of land with traffic and you want to get your car to crash at the busy intersection in the scene in order to cause the biggest pileup and do the most damage.\n\nTRAFFIC ATTACK: In this mode, you are given a limited number of seconds (you start with maybe 20 or so) and you just need to check traffic. Hit as much same way traffic as possible to add another second to your time. Each car hit gives you money; the better the accident caused the more money earned. Earn a certain amount of money to clear the stage.\n\nPREVIEW LAP/BURNING LAP: Most similar to regular racing games – this is just your car trying to get the fastest time on an empty circuit.\n\nELIMINATOR: Similar to a regular race against 5 other computer opponents, but every thirty seconds, the last place car is eliminated from the race until the last car remains.\n\nGRAND PRIX: A set of three races where the place you finish in each race gives you a point score. Highest point score at the end of the three races wins the Grand Prix.\n\nEach map is quite big and has plenty of ways through the course due to shortcuts. The shortcuts are sometimes quite tough to see as they are only indicated by two small blue lights, but with enough time and experience on a map, the shortcuts will be easier to find. What’s interesting is that taking shortcuts is not always the best way to win a race – because by taking these shortcuts you are avoiding any other racers to attack.\n\nWhat I also like a lot about the game is that as a non-car enthusiast, I can still enjoy the game since it doesn’t focus on the vehicles. There’s plenty of cars to collect, but the cars get unlocked as you rank up, with each new car pretty much being better (e.g. faster top speed) than what you already have. Thus, there’s no need to worry about which car to drive on a course; the newest car is usually best and the car selector defaults to that car when you select a course.\n\nIf you can’t tell the jump in speed when using Turbo, you can always look for the blue glow prominently showing from behind the car.\n\nGame Mechanics\n\nHow does a racing game like this encourage you to drive aggressively and to crash opponents’ cars? Through a Turbo (or Nitro, for the Fast & the Furious fans) meter. For every aggressive action your car does, your meter goes up a little. Driving on the oncoming vehicle lane increases your meter. Catching a lot of air time with your vehicle by flying off ramps increases your meter. Bumping into cars increases your meter.\n\nRamming pedestrian cars into other cars, known as checking cars, adds to your Turbo meter.\n\nOne game play addition to this game that was not present in previous Burnout games is the concept of checking traffic. Since the races in the game are not on closed tracks, there’s generally regular traffic everywhere. If you hit any car that is moving in the direction that you’re moving, you’ll slam it forward like one pool ball hitting another. The only things you can’t hit are large busses, trucks, and oncoming traffic. If you hit any of those you will crash. Fortunately, any time you crash, your car will respawn again in a few seconds like Mario Kart.\n\nTaking out several opponents will increase your Turbo meter to a max length of 4 times the starting meter.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic around the game is the Takedown, which consequently gives you the most turbo. If you can perform a Takedown on your racing opponents by causing them to crash into a wall, truck, bus, or even flip them over yourself, your turbo bar not only fills up completely, but it increases(up to 4 times the initial turbo meter length). The best part of the Takedowns are that the game switches to slow motion to show the car crashing and burning. Several times my wife has commented that she hears a sinister laugh from me. I never though I’d have such an evil laugh, but I guess it came out with this game (me shouting out, “Eat my dust son! Muhahaha…”). Basically, if you can’t perform Takedowns on your opponents when you race, you won’t be able to generate enough turbo to win the race. You have to take them out. There’s no winning for defensive drivers in this game!\n\nAfter getting taken out by an opponent, the camera will focus on the car that just performed your Takedown so you can get a good look at your new rival.\n\nThe main theme of this iteration of Burnout is revenge. When an opponent takes you out, the camera will focus on the opponent (after the footage of your car crashing) and label him your new Revenge Rival. He is clearly marked with a red arrow when you race (as opposed to blue arrows for the other opponents) and if you are successful at taking him out, your revenge will net you twice the turbo boost you’d get from a regular opponent Takedown. The game definitely encourages vengeance.\n\nEven if another care performs a takedown on you, you can still takedown other cars too. When you crash, other cars will crash too if they hit your crash. It’s funny because if you crash and go airborne, you have some control over where you’ll fall. If you can position yourself in such a way to get an opponent behind you to crash also, you’ll get credit for a Takedown as well and spawn with a full turbo meter. On later levels, you can even blow your car up for a bigger radius of taking down rival racers.\n\nThere is also something called a Signature Takedown. These are unique takedowns specifically only accomplishable for particular locations of a track. There are 24 in total for the game, which means there are 3 for each of the 8 tracks. I’ve only gotten a few of them so far, and they were by chance. Eventually, I know I’m going to find it a little frustrating to get them all since they require a lot of things to go right. But the names are inventive like many of the more creative Achievement names for 360 games.\n\nHere are some Signature Takedown examples:\n\n1) Lumber Party – “Slam a rival into the logging machinery”\n\n2) Stairs In Their Eyes – “Get a Signature Takedown on the dividing wall, heading up the steps”\n\nIt’s like Criterion Games came up with the concepts of Achievements in their own Burnout games before the 360 Achievement system was even invented.\n\nIf going through all ten ranks and collecting all the Signature Takedowns is not enough for you, each Rank has its own set of Challenges that you can try to complete.\n\nFor example, here is one challenge set from a rank:\n\n1) Get double payback\n\n2) Win a race without crashing\n\n3) Do a vertical Takedown\n\n4) Do 1 revenge Takedowns in a race\n\n5) Takedown a special car\n\n6) Check 100 vehicles in Traffic Attack\n\n7) Blow up 35 vehicles\n\n8) High score target: $15,000,000\n\nIf you’re trying to do everything in the single player mode, you’ll definitely be spending a lot of time.\n\nStaying in the air for a long amount of time will net you a “Great Air” bonus and more Turbo will be added your Turbo meter.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nI honestly never got a chance to try multiplayer yet, but from what I’ve read so far, the community to this game is still somewhat strong. Games can easily be found for the many game types available similar to the single player World Tour Mode.\n\nUnfortunately, cheating exists and is one of the major deterrents for me not wanting to play online. I’m not exactly sure how people cheat since I was too lazy to look it up, but a quick glance on some forums for this game illustrate to me that cheating exists so even if you were to get really good, it won’t matter since you won’t be holding the records due to cheaters placing better.\n\nThe last time I tried an online racer was Mario Kart DS, and everyone I played against was doing the boost dashing all over the place. I was pretty horrified about that and didn’t bother playing it online again, as that was clearly not how the game was meant to be played. I can only imagine how actual online Burnout Revenge games really go. It’s a shame too, because Criterion Games put a lot of time into the online component for Live with such features as remembering your rivals if you ever come across them in games online and the like.\n\nCriterion Games has also implemented video sharing online, so that you can share the coolest Takedowns/accidents that you’ve filmed either through World Tour or in multiplayer races. There are even Achievements associated with video sharing, such as having a video being among the top twenty most downloaded for the week. The sharing of these videos is most likely a good feature in nurturing this online community.\n\nDriving with Turbo for a lengthy period of time will net you even more Turbo!\n\nAchievement System\n\nI’m happy that Criterion Games spent a lot of time coming up with interesting and skillful Achievements. It’s a testament to how difficult to get they are if I’ve already played maybe 10-20 hours into the game and only gotten 3 Achievements so far.\n\nBesides getting perfect (5 points) on all missions for all ranks, the rest of the Achievements are devoted to online modes and video sharing, and offline skillful ones. I like that there’s an Achievement for getting all 24 Signature Takedowns, as that’s something to definitely be proud of when anyone looks at your Gamertag:\n\nAchievement: Should be Autographs!\n\n“Signed off! Awarded for completing all 24 Signature Takedowns!” (35 points)\n\nWith a total of 36 Achievements, there’s a lot to accomplish in this game and the Achievements are definitely awards for difficult tasks, as opposed to other games where they’re pretty much handed to you. Without Achievements I’d be content beating ranks in this game coming in 2nd or 3rd place for everything, but there are no Achievements for coming in second or third – only first. Thus, I will probably be playing this game for a while to come to get those Achievements. Bravo with the interesting and skillful Achievements, Criterion Games.\n\nIt’s possible to takedown more than one opponent if you’ve crashed – you just need good positioning.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs I have said earlier, this game is very well done. For its $30 price point, it’s definitely worth it. It’s even worth it at $60 because it’s such a complete package. The graphics and sound are top notch, the gameplay fun and addicting, and the game is accessible enough that people that don’t know or care about driving games can just play it and enjoy it. The game is incredibly lengthy for a non-sim car racing game. Burnout Revenge always seems to keep providing you with more things to do, and steps up the level of challenge gradually enough that you get better as you play so you’re always improving.\n\nI give this game an A-. It’s nearly a perfect game, but the main issue preventing it from getting the A is the cheating for online and how it hasn’t been dealt with. The loading is also a bit long compared to any other 360 game I’ve played so far. I also docked it a point or two because the game isn’t completely new – in fact, it’s a redone version of the PS2 and Xbox version that came out back in 2005. Having said that, I’m very eager to see how the recently announced sequel to Burnout Revenge, Burnout Paradise, will look. I’m pretty certain I will be lining up and ready to buy the sequel on Day 1, as I’m now a Burnout fan."
