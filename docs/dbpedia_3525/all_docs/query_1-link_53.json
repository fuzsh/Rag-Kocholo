        "text": "Not exactly an RTTP or anything but I've been playing through Revenge again on the Series X and it just doesn't click with me. It feels off and while some of the new additions like Traffic Check and and all that sound good, I feel like they don't always work.\n\nThe ratings system is the worst. I hate that I get penalized by losing a 5th star if I don't constantly crash cars or other racers. Especially when I need to focus on beating the goal.\n\nLike I also mentioned earlier the racing feels stiffer to me than Burnout 3. I find myself crashing or suddenly going backwards like never before.\n\nBurnout: Revenge is a great game. There's no doubt about that. But I will always wish that Takedown was the BC title and not Revenge.\n\nI love both. Wish I could still go online for Revenge on Xbox 360 BC\n\nTakedown is indeed the better game, but Revenge isn't awful.\n\nBoth are more fun than Paradise.\n\nOh Revenge is definitely a great game. I know I'm pining for Takedown but Revenge is fun for those who need a taste of Burnout!\n\nI really didn't like that you could plow through traffic. Burnout to me was always about weaving and slaloming.\n\nYeah with Revenge they totally ruined the risk/reward of weaving in between same way traffic. It's an okay game but Burnout 3 is still the peak of the series.\n\nRevenge is about 3rd best in the series to me.\n\nMost people prefer takedown, I don't.\n\nYeah with Revenge they totally ruined the risk/reward of weaving in between same way traffic. It's an okay game but Burnout 3 is still the peak of the series.\n\ntakedown literally turns the franchise in to car combat game, you're rewarded more for combat in 3 than decent racing.\n\nI really loved both games back in the day. Great gameplay and amazing tech for a PS2 game.\n\nAny impressions on Dominator? I suppose it was worse than both of these and never got to try it, but I am curious.\n\n1 was ok but aged horribly.\n\n2 was/is amazing\n\n3 was/is amazing\n\n4 is good, but felt like they were running out of ideas slightly and traffic checking felt a bit naff. They honestly kind of ruined crash mode with the golf swing too\n\nParadise I hated since it was open world and generally don't like open world racers.\n\nI'd have to play them again side by side to notice the difference. I loved them both and looking back whenever I think of the series I basically consider them the same game. Legit didn't even realize there were differences because it's been so long. Both are far better than paradise god what a fucking misfire that was. Was so hyped for it too but between the intro and the open world I'm never revisiting it\n\nI really loved both games back in the day. Great gameplay and amazing tech for a PS2 game.\n\nAny impressions on Dominator? I suppose it was worse than both of these and never got to try it, but I am curious.\n\nIt was quite fun from what I played.\n\nYup, this. Paradise is one of the most overrated games, Burnout 3 is wayyyyyy better.\n\nI think the reason Paradise got the remaster etc, is because it sold great. But we all bought it after going 2, 3 -> revenge .\n\nBe amazing if they did another. Playing Hot Pursuit a bit recently, that's great too .\n\n1 was ok but aged horribly.\n\n2 was/is amazing\n\n3 was/is amazing\n\n4 is good, but felt like they were running out of ideas slightly and traffic checking felt a bit naff. They honestly kind of ruined crash mode with the golf swing too\n\nParadise I hated since it was open world and generally don't like open world racers.\n\nWhy does everyone always forget Burnout 5 Dominator!\n\nEveryone seems to forget Dominator xD. And Crash but eh.\n\nBurnout Legends was the GOAT for me for so long. Not as good as Takedown but portable Burnout!\n\nDo you have any idea how badly I want a Burnout 3 + Burnout Revenge Remaster?\n\nI'm with you there. I want that so much.\n\nThank God I'm not the only one who misses 2.\n\nEven if they can't make 3 BC due to licensing crap, Microsoft and EA can still try to get 2. That game is all original music and generic cars.\n\nWhy does everyone always forget Burnout 5 Dominator!\n\nIt always felt like the step child of the franchise. It wasn't made by criterion. It didn't feel like much of a sequel since it actually removed a bunch of stuff including crash mode... It honestly kind of just felt like a psp game that happened to also have a PS2 port to me.\n\nI actually welcomed the traffic check but it didn't work like I wanted it to work. It makes the car feel a bit sturdier but more brittle at times? IDK if you get what I mean lol. Like the cars in the 3 always felt brittle if you weren't battling against racers but with the traffic check it's different. I would still ike a remaster of 3 tho. That was a perfect game IMO."
