        "text": "I've been getting loads of questions about the \"DEI Hire\" digs aimed at Vice President Kamala Harris. Much has already been said, so I'll just leave this here. As a seasoned human capital and DEI executive of color, I'm no stranger to these lazy, loaded comments. They represent the hypocrisy of our times - just another assignment to dismiss and discredit the undeniable talent, credentials, expertise, and leadership resilience of over-excelling despite relentless hurdles. But they still sting. Our indignation? Duly recorded. Our rage? Articulated. What’s our assignment? I choose truth, action, hope and joy. When I'm feeling wobbly and tempted to clap back at these tired attacks, I lean on what I know: - Back when I was a newbie DEI practitioner, a senior leader of color asked how I'd handle white leaders questioning my strategies for diversifying leadership ranks. I remember the pause and the knowing look we shared. I replied, \"I sit in meetings where no one bats an eye at a white guy pushing for a product or ad campaign that ignores or offends lucrative diverse customer bases, without a shred of data, or hiring his underqualified buddy from his alma mater. So, I have no qualms about advocating for what's best for our business and society.\" - As an HR exec, I've witnessed exceptional, highly qualified women, especially women of color, repeatedly bypassed for executive roles by white men with thinner resumes but tighter leadership connections. And when those men fail or, worse, bail on their teams, these women are called in to clean up the mess and bear the weight of chaos. - And that \"hiring bar\" some people are so keen to defend? It's more like a limbo stick, shifting to the tune of \"I like you, I don't like you,\" driven by deep-seated biases and fears. I've been in the room making hiring and promotion decisions, championing choices based on leadership versatility tied to business needs, sometimes leaning on potential and resilience for those with limited opportunities, and being beaten into submission to make the wrong ones. Been there, done that. I'm preserving my energy for the assignment ahead because truly diverse, inclusive, high-performing workplaces and societies need ALL of us! It's time to maximize the roles we want to play at work, home, and our communities, and figure out how to stay energized for the long haul. What does that look like? Take a breath, know and embody your worth, respond to what needs responding (pro tip: you don't have to react to everything), find the best ways to make an impact, and collaborate powerfully. Do you have any other tips to recharge, reset and dodge burnout in these wild times? #leadership #diversityequityandinclusion #management #burnout"
