One of them was called Sheikh Fareed. They were welcomed by the natives and settled themselves in different vocations. Their history was maintained orally until about the year 1770. In the \"Thombu\" of 1770 (the Government record), there is reference to one Paridoe. It is a custom of the Muslims to carry the name of theor ancestors in the line of genealogy and this Paridoe is the name carried from Sheikh Fareed.\n\nThere lived a wealthy lady, possessiung vast extents of land at Ambagahawatte, in the lineage of this Fareed. When she passed away, Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar, was the heir left behind to inherit this property.\n\nAfter collecting his own share, Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar bought the shares of several other heirs of this land and donated a portion of it to build a mosque and later built another mosque called the Fareed Thakkiya. He had started off his career as an apprentice working under expert builders. His flair for Islamic architecture can be seen in the many arches used in his architecture. He mastered the building profession and undertook the erection of buildings independently as a building contractor.\n\nSo long as brick and mortar endure his name will be long remembered as the builder of the General Post Office in Colombo, the Colombo Museum, Colombo Customs, Old Town Hall in Pettah, the Galle Face Hotel, Victoria Arcade, Finlay Moir building, the Clock Tower, Batternburg Battery etc. The Old Town Hall in Pettah, which is now a busy market, was built on a contract for the sum of 689 Streling Pounds.\n\nIn January 1877, the completed building of the Colombo Museum was declared open by His Excellency, Governer Gregory, in the presence of a large crowd, amongst which there were many Muslims present. At the end of the ceremony His Excellency asked Arasi Marikar Wapchi Marikar what honour he wished to have for his dedication. The same question was asked by His Excellency from the carpenter who assisted Wapchi Marikar with the wood work of the Museum who desired a local Rank and was honoured accordingly. Wapchi Marikar, noticing the large number of Muslims present, feared that they would spend their time at the Museum on Friday during the Islamic congregation prayer, and requested that the Museum be closed on Fridays. This request has been adhered to by all authorities in charge of the Museum to this day.\n\nWhen the throne of the last Kandyan King was to be exhibited at the Museum, the then Prime Minister, Mr. D.S.Senanayake, obtained the consent of Sir Razik Fareed, Wapchi Marikars grandson, to keep the Museum open on the intervening Fridays only.\n\nEndowed with wealth, Wapchi Marikar contributed to the development of his communities wefare, religious, economical, social, and educational needs and searched for more avenues and opportunities to help them in every way possible. He resided in the vicinity of Marakkala Palliya Watta, the present Maradana Mosque grounds and patronized the mosque. His family residence was acquired by the state for railway extensions thus compeling him to build a large house at Vauxhall Street where he moved in subsequently. He continued to contribute towards the development of the Maradana Mosque by being a prominent member of the congregation. He also joined hand with and financed M.C.Siddi Lebbe, from Kandy, who started the Muslim educational movement in 1880.\n\nSiddi Lebbe, in his \"Asrarul Alam\" on page 199 writes,\n\n\"I have two friends in Colombo, one who takes great interest in educational matters, opening up schools and spending liberally his money is Arasi Marikar Wapchi Marikar philanthrophist, who comes forward to spend in all good causes. The other is Ghulam Mohiyadeen Sahib Bahauddin of Tanjore (Kashwat Alim)\".\n\nWapchi Marikar and Siddi Lebbe set about looking for a place to establish a school for the Muslims and eventually selected the abandoned portion of the Maradana Mosque grounds. Since Wapchi Marikar was, at that time, the Vice President of the Management Committee of the Maradana Mosque, he urged the committee to grant a lease of the land in order to build the school.\n\nA society, called the \"Jamiyathul Uloom\" (Muslim Educational Society) was thus formed.\n\nWapchi Marikar, at his own cost, erected a building for the school and also built four houses that would be rented and the income utilized for the maintenance of the institution.\n\nDuring this period, Wapchi Marikar was involved in the construction of Masjid-E-Careem at 4th Cross Street, Pettah, for Carimjee Jafferjee. At his request Jafferjee contributed money for an additional building at the Maradana Mosque grounds for the cause of Muslim education.\n\nWhen the Kuppiyawatte burial grounds was given to the Muslims (Crown grant 3325 dated 18-8-1879), a condition was laid down by the Government that a boundary wall must be erected within three years of that date. The Mussalmans United Assembly had insufficient funds and approached Wapchi Marikar who negotiated with Careemjee Jafferjee for building the wall in exchange for a portion of land for use of burial of the dead of the Borah community.\n\nWhen the Muslims of Ketawallamulla needed a mosque they approached Wapchi Marikar who bought a house at Clifton Lane and converted it into a mosque. A.L.M. Meera Lebbe Marikar, who lived opposite the mosque, was made the Trustee. M.L.M. Ahmed, JP of Ahmed Brothers, 3rd Cross Street, Pettah, is the son of A.L.M. Meera Lebbe Marikar.\n\nThe school building was finally completed and Madarasahul Zahira ( Zahira College) began to function. Arabi Pasha conducted the opening.\n\nThe houses constructed for the purpose of revenue for running the school were acquired by the government in 1906. Using the compensation received from the acquisition, Wapchi Marikar built a row of houses facing Darley Road, presently T.B.Jayah Mawatha.\n\nWapchi Marikar was also the Treasurer and Manager of the Colombo Muslim Educational Society.\n\nIn 1907, Wapchi Marikar was relieved of the burden of management and Advocate Abdul Cader was appointed as Manager of Zahira College. However, Abdul Cader had to relinquish his position on account of relocating himself to Batticaloa in the Eastern Province.\n\nAn address presented to Wapchi Marikar by the Moors (Muslims) of Colombo in 1907 reads as follows:-\n\nARASY MARIKAR WAPCHI MARIKAR ESQ.\n\nThe late Manager of the Mohamedan Boys Maradana School, Colombo.\n\n(MADARASATHUL ZAHIRA)\n\nSir,\n\nWe, the members of the Colombo Muslim Educational Society, have the pleasure of conveying to you our warm appreciation of the work done by you, with zeal and energy, in managing the Mohamedan Boys Maradana School for the last fourteen years; and of expressing to you, on your retirement from the said managership, heartfelt and sincere gratitude, on our own behalf and on behalf of the Mohamedan Community of Colombo, for the said work as well as for the pecuniary assistance generously rendered by you for establishing the said school to impart religious abd secular education to the Mohamedan youth of this country; for your liberal endowment towards its upkeep; and for your enthusiastic cooperation with which we have so long controlled and conducted the affairs of the said institution.

Ibrahim Lebbe)\n\nThe descriptions of the signatories are later interpolations for better understanding of the persons involved in relation to presently known persons amongs the Muslim Community.\n\nIn 1907, Wapchi Marikar built, at his own cost, an extension building to the existing first school building. A section of the Educational Society collected a sum of Rs. 12,750 and entrusted it to Wapchi Marikar for the construction of houses along the street adjoining the New Olympia Theatre in Maradana. Unfortunately, the Colombo Muslim Educational Society did not function for very long and it became incumbent on Wapchi Marikar to manage the affairs of Zahira College all by himself as a single individual using his own personal finances and the welfare of some other Muslim philanthrophists.\n\nFinding the income from rents of the Darley Road properties insufficient to manage the school he offered the income from his own properties at Wellawatte to augment the revenues of Zahira College. In 1921, being physically unfit to attend to the daily affairs of Zahira College, Wapchi Marikar discussed the matter with two of the members of the now defunct Education Society and handed over the management to the Maradana Mosque.\n\nHe was a devout and pious Muslim who built, served and developed mosques spending liberally for all religious affairs. His maxim was \"cut ones coat according to the cloth\". He passed away on May 14, 1925 at the ripe old age of ninety six. His only son was the Hon. W.M. Abdul Rahman, M.L.C. and his daughter was Mariambu Natchar.\n\nHon. W.M. Abdul Rahman (1868-1933)\n\nHon. W.M. Abdul Rahman was born at Colombo on 26-Mar-1868, educated at the Government School at Gasworks Street and later on at Wesley College, Colombo. He joined his fathers building enterprise in 1888 but retired in 1898. In 1900 he was nominated to the Legislative Council as the Muslim member.\n\nIn his honor the Moors Union hosted a dinner party presided over by Abdul Azeez. He died on 6-Apr-1933 and was buried at Kuppiyawatte Muslim Burial Grounds, Maradana.\n\nOn November 14, 1902 a Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed to consider the treatment of criminals. The committee comprised of Hon A.J. Lascelles, Attorney General, Hon Loos. Hon H.H.Cameron, Hon H.L. Crawford, Hon S. Bois, Hon W. M.Abdul Rahman. Another committee was appointed on January 23, 1903 to consider the Customs Duties Amendment Bill. composed of the Attorney General, Auditor General, the European Member, the Mercantile Member, the Principal Collector of Customs and the Mohamedan Member, the Hon. W.M.Abdul Rahman.\n\nOn February 10, 1943, Abdul Rahman supported the enlargement of the Executive Council in the Legisltive Council. On December 15, 1905 the Attorney General moved that the bill for the consideration of the Tariff amendments be undertaken by a committee consisting of the following:- Attorney General, Auditor General, PCC, Hon J.Ferguson, Hon M.F.Walker, Hon Abdul Rahman. On November 22, 1906 the hon Treasurer moved that the following sub-committee be appointed to reply His Excellency the Governors address: The Hon Treasurer, Hon Director of Works, Hon Registrar General, Hon Low Country Sinhalese Member, The Planting Member, The Hon General European Member, and the Hon W.M.Abdul Rahman, the Mohamedan Member.\n\nOn December 12, 1906, in the Legislative Council, The Hon member for the Mohamedan Community, Hon W.M.Abdul Rahman expressed the condolences of his community at the death of Sir Alexander Ashmore, the Colonal Secretary. On February 10, 1909, the Hon W.M.Abdul Rahman opposed the expenditure of large sums of money on the lake Scheme from Loans on account of many other urgent works that were of higher priority and were being kept in abeyance.\n\nIn the Legislative Council, on February 25, 1909, Hon W.M.Abdul Rahman desired that His Excellency the Governer should have the power to appoint deserving members in Government service to some of the higher posts without having to take competitive examinations. He claimed that it was unfair to expect senior Government servants to compete with boys fresh from school.\n\nAbdul Rahman was a member of the Agricultural Society, Orient Club, Ceylon Turf Club and Liberal League. He was also the Vice President of the Social Reform Society and a keen supporter of sports. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Maradana Mosque and the President of the Ceylon Muslim Educational Society Ltd., Muslim Spiritual Society and the Moors Sports Club. He was a member of the Agricultural Society and the Orient Club and one of the principal members of the Ceylon Turf Club. He was also widely traveled in India. Abdul Rahman also owned wide extents of land and property in Ceylon besides owning a large coconut estate in Kurunegala in the North Western Province. He also spent a large portion of his time and money for the development of education of Muslims in Ceylon.\n\nIn 1905 a massive public meeting was held at the Maradana mosque grounds to protest against the action of the Supreme Court in refusing to hear M.C.Abdul Cader address the court as an Advocate because he wore a Fez cap, the national headgear of the Ceylon Moors, on his head. The Hon W.M. Abdul Rahman presided at this meeting. Subsequently permission was granted by the Colonial Secretary for Muslims to wear the Fez cap in court provided they also wore the long black coat which they normally wore at ceremonies.\n\nIn 1912 Abdul Rahman presided at the mass meeting of Muslims to protest against the Italian invasion of Tripoli, then ruled by the Turkish Sultan.\n\nAt an interview by a news reporter of the \"Ceylon Independent\" in 1917 Abdul Rahman said,\n\n\"English education among the Muslims was at a low ebb and considering the population the percentage of really educated men was awfully small. We have the Zahira College, started about tenty six years ago by my father \"\n\n\"and there is every possibility of enlarging the building, mproving the school by the addition of a Science Laboratory and employing a larger and more efficient staff of teachers \"\n\nSpeaking on the conditions of the Ceylon Muslims, Abdul Rahman said,\n\n\"it was deplorable. The apparent prosperity of the people was due to the fact that they possess ancestral property on which they live at ease. There was great competition in trade now and the trade that used to be in the hands of the Moors is now shared with others. For the past seven or eight years a revival was noticeable and young Muslims were taking to the professions and the Clerical Service and evincing a greater interest in English education. If that was not followed up with energy, the Muslims, he feared, would, in another twenty or thirty years, be only rawers of water and hewers of wood\".\n\nIn 1924, N.H.M.Abdul Cader submitted a Bill to the Legislative Council for incorporating the body of the Maradana Mosque management. Abdul Rahman objected and suggested certain safe-guards for the congregation who are permanent residents of Maradana. his suggestions were included in the Bill.\n\nAbdul Rahman passed away on April 6, 1933, leaving three children. One was Sir Razik Fareed and the other two were daughters, Mrs. Razeena Mohideen (wife of Ghouse Mohideen), manageress of the Muslim ladies College, Colombo and the first Ceylon Moor woman Justice of the Peace, and Mrs. Rakeeba Fuard (mother of M.F.A.Jaward, Private Secretary to Sir Razik Fareed).\n\nAccording to a memo issued by the Department of Income Tax, Estate Duty & Stamps, dated Colombo, 29 january 1936, it is mentioned that an estate duty amounting to Rs 10,591.70 was paid in full on account of the estate of Abdul Rahman as per Estate No: ED/A 72  DC Colombo Case No.6456  Hon Mr Wapchi Marikar Abdul Rahman  Deceased\n\nIn the matter of the Last Will and Testament of the Hon Mr Wapchi Marikar Abdul Rahman of Razeendale Bambalapitiya South in Colombo, under Testamentart Jurisdiction No 6456, where Abdul Rahman Abdul Razik (son of Abdul Rahman and later referred to as Sir Razik Fareed), the inventory of the estate of WM Abdul Rahman was declared as follows:-\n\nMOVEABLES\n\nAmount in Imperial Bank of India Rs 69.52\n\nAmount due on promissory note dated 14 December 1927 Rs 3,000.00\n\nHousehold furniture etc. Rs 3,179.00\n\nRents outstanding at date of death Rs 914.00\n\nTotal Rs 7,162.52\n\nIMMOVEABLES\n\n1.

OBE, JP UM (1893-1984)\n\nSir Razik Fareed Kt. OBE, JP UM (1893-1984), was born on 29-Dec-1893 and educated at Madrasathul Zahira and Royal College, Colombo. He held the prestigious positions of President, All Ceylon Moors Association, Member CMC, HR, Senate, First Member Colombo Central, High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Pakistan. Gifted lands to establish Muslim Ladies College. Founder Member Moors Islamic Cultural Home in 1944 and held the position of its first President. Established Maternity Homes in the City of Colombo and rural hospitals in predominantly Muslim areas. Died:23-Aug-1984.\n\nSir Razik Fareed's birth anniversary - December 29\n\nSir Razik Fareed was born on the 10th day of Muharram 1312 (29th December 1893) at the Layards Broadway. He is the son of W.M. Abdul Rahuman and Hajara Umma his mother passed away when Sir Razik was only three years. He was the grandson of Wappichchi Marikar. He came into residence at 'Hajara Villa' Fareed Place, Colombo in 1915.\n\nSir Razik Fareed inherited from his ancestors the spirit of service to his community and country. Wappichchi Marikkar founded Zahira College Colombo, while Sir Razik founded the Muslim Ladies College two leading schools for boys and girls.\n\nSir Razik championed the cause of Sinhala - Moor unity and a united Sri Lanka, thus demonstrating that the interest of the Moor community and the welfare of all Sri Lankan were near and dear to him. In this respect he proved his sincerity by his relentless service to the Muslim community and the country. No wonder he was popularly known as the 'Uncrowned King of the Ceylon Moors.'\n\nIn 1930 he entered politics and was elected a member of the Municipal Council. He was a Senator and a Member of Parliament in a long political career capped by his appointment as a Minister in 1960. Later he moved into the diplomatic field and was Sri Lanka's High Commissioner in Pakistan. He wanted the Muslims to be politically mature and that they identify themselves with national parties. He left the choice with the people in selecting the national party that they should support.\n\nMuslims were elected as representative in majority Sinhala voter electorates like Borella, Akurana and Beruwala. The majority community reposed confidence in Muslims.\n\nIn 1946 Sir Razik was associated with Mr. D.S. Senanayake in founding the United National Party. He established the Muslim Ladies' College to give every educated Muslim boy and educated Muslim bride. Former principal of Zahira College Colombo Marhoom A.M.A. Azeez said that he would live in the history of our country as the 'Father of the Government Muslim School.'\n\nSir Razik was a person with a generous heart. He has spent much of his wealth on the poor without many knowing it. He served the community as president and later life president of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home (MICH) for more than 40 years. His grandfather and father had done a great service to Muslim Community. In 1932 Marhoom Sir Razik was made a Justice of Peace and an unofficial magistrate.\n\nSir Razik Fareed lived with unity with other communities in this country. Sir Razik's father was a good friend with the Sinhalese Tamils and Burgher communities leaders. Sir Razik was example Sinhala-Muslim Ekamuthukama. He was good example today's Muslim politicians and follow the examples of Mahroom Sir Razik Fareed, Dr. Baduidin Mahmood, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel and Dr. T.B. Jayah who made an effective contribution to the community and country. They lived with self-respect maintaining the dignity and well being of the community.\n\nThe late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike said, \"I regard Sir Razik not only as the leader of the Ceylon Moors but also one of the greatest Ceylonese Leaders.\"\n\nA grateful community has established a foundation inspired by a sense of gratitude called the Sir Razik Fareed Foundation to foster and preserve for posterity the humble service rendered by him.\n\nHe passed away on August 23, 1984 at the age of 91.\n\n'Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Illahi Rajioon'\n\nM. Ruzaik Farook JP, President Sri Lanka Islamic Society - Dec 29 2003\n\nSir Razik Fareed's 20th death anniversary is tomorrow:\n\nFlame that lit lives of thousands\n\nby P. P. M. Saheed - SO Aug 22 2004\n\nTwenty years ago today, a flame that lit the lives of thousands in this country was extinguished. But the light of the great are never really snuffed out. They continue to fire our spirit, our wills, give us courage, help us to sacrifice and continue to illumine every dark corner if our lives as long as we continue to remember and honour that great goodness of soul that make such men unique.\n\nThis is why today, I stand in testimony to this great light and recall that surging spirit of a man who served his country so well, so ably, so dedicatedly. He was as Dr. W. Dahanayake called him, \"the uncrowned king of the Moors of Sri Lanka.\" He was Sir Razik Fareed, a man so towering in mental stature, so noble in word and deed, that all honour sat lightly upon him and the minutes of his everyday moved in slow, measured tread, as though time itself passed and paused at his feet in order that he could make the fullest use of every ticking second.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nI pen this note to acknowledge him not to merely remember him. We in Sri Lanka, will always remember. not only the Muslim community but the people of all races and creeds. We have all of us benefitted from this one life; and I may well quote Shakespeare in saying that this, indeed, was a man \" whence cometh such another.\"\n\nHis long years of national and community service are studded with many milestones. Member of the Central Muslim Youth Conference in 1913 Lieutenant of the Colombo Town Guard in the civil strife of 1915 .President of the All Ceylon Moors Association for nearly 40 years .President of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home for over 30 years .Founder member of the United National Party Member of the Colombo Municipal Council for 16 years Member of the then State Council and Senate .Member of the House of Representatives for Colombo Central for three terms .High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Pakistan in 1968 President of the Ceylon Kennel Club .President of the Ceylon Poultry Club and Orchid Circle steward of the Ceylon Turf Club.\n\nHe straddled the political scene of our country for over a generation and was also a distinguished member of the Peace Council of Sri Lanka. Above all, he put country first evidenced by what he maintained both publicly and privately many times over. When Great Britain wanted to give us our independence, he said:\n\nLet us (Muslims) not think of our own selfish interests. We join hands with the majority community and we say we want independence: we want freedom for Sri Lanka\". All his life, he also worked for the amelioration of the conditions of the Muslims of this country.\n\nHis doughtly efforts saw the establishment of schools for Muslims all over the island as well as Muslim Teacher Training Colleges at Addalaichenai and Aluthgama. He gave Muslim education the massive impetus that has put it in seven-league boots today, and furthermore he never detracted from his great vision of a united Sri Lanka - a nation of multi-racial, multireligious, multi-cultural unity where all communities lived in harmony, equality and peace.\n\nSir Razik Fareed was also the \"Father of the UNANI system of Medicine in Ceylon.\" In paving the way for our independence he said on the floor of the House in 1945:\n\n\"It is our political sanctity if I may say so, and a sense of justice, that made us stand up and fight side by side with the Sinhalese in the course of obtaining Dominion Status\". To Sir Razik, Sinhala-Moor unity - Sinhala Yonaka Ekamuthukama was almost an article of faith. He was, above all, a great bridge-builder between communities, and here, above all, in his loss felt most keenly.\n\nMany of us remember Sir Razik as the last surviving Sri Lankan knight for he was the link with British honours. But Royal conferment only served to emphasise the true nature of the man. He had been a true knight all his life with all those knightly qualities impelled him to serve, alleviate pain, ease the pangs of distress, set to right the wrongs of public and community life, defend the oppressed, succour the enfeebled, uplift the downtrodden.\n\nI still remember with pride his words in his presidential address at the opening at the new building of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home in 1965:\n\n\"The island needs the close co-operation of all creeds and communities to develop its resources with patriotic zeal and, if need be, with sacrifice. This must transcend all other considerations. Let me therefore appeal to you and to all right-thinking citizens to sink all differences in the national interest and strive to make Ceylon a happier place to live in and die for. I exhort my fellow compatriots to remember what the Prophet of Islam meant when he said: Patriotism is part of the Faith.\"\n\nWhen I consider the breathtaking arena of Sir Razik Fareed's life's, work I have often wondered how such frail shoulders could bear all they carried. This, to me, was the wonder of the man who my close personal friend for a great many years. Everyone's just battle became his own. He fought the British-owned Gas Company of Colombo a long time ago so that the city of Colombo be lit by electricity. He fought for the education of Muslim girls and set up the Muslim Ladies College, which is today one of the biggest educational institutions for Muslim girls in this country.\n\nFought for a cause\n\nWhat is more, he fought for the cause of the Moulavis - the Islam and Arabic teachers who were at the mercy of mosque trustees and carned a pitiful pittance of about Rs. 30 or Rs. 40 as salary. Sir Razik Fareed brought them into recognition as government teachers on par with the others, thus giving these skilled, erudite scholars a place in the educational sun.\n\nThis is only as it should be. Sir Razik inherited from his family, a love for education.\n\nHis grandfather, Wapiche Marikar, built and nurtured Zahira College and a number of Arabic schools in Colombo. Sir Razik Fareed's father, W. M. Abdul Rahman, was President of the Muslim Educational Society and superintended the educational progress of the Muslim community. This is the mantle Sir Razik inherited and wore with such grace all his life. He it was, who was instrumental in founding a Department for Arabic studies in the University of Peradeniya.\n\nHow does one measure the worth of such a man? It is said that the soldier is measured by his medals; the politician by his words; the artist by his canvas; the craftsman by his hands.\n\nHow, then, does one consider the worth of this distinguished son of Sri Lanka? As his friend and associate for many years, I have only one yardstick as I look around and see all who honour him on this his 20th death anniversary. I see the outpouring of love, of deep respect, and feel the keen sense of loss. Yes, dear brothers and sisters, this is how I would measure him: by the love he awakened in us, the respect he so easily earned, the admiration he commanded, the valour of his every action, the fortitude of his every earthly hour.\n\nAssociation\n\nMy association with Sir Razik Fareed, then (A. R. A. Razik) started in 1947, when I went to him to get a job as an English Assistant Teacher, which I received on the same day. This was a miracle. This association lasted till his death in August 1984 - a period of 37 years.\n\nTo him I was always \"dear Saheed\" or \"dear M.P.M.\".\n\nI recall with what great joy I congratulated him by letter on June 12, 1981, when he was honoured as a national hero of Sri Lanka. It was also then that I decided to put this tribute into more concrete form. I had already established a fully equipped meeting hall in Kandy to cater to the social and cultural needs of the Muslim community. What better name, I decided, than the Sir Razik Fareed Assembly Hall and so it was.\n\nAnd so did hundreds gather at this hall on Saturday the 28th November 1981 to honour Sir Razik Fareed and acknowledge that if today, we as a community can raise our heads to be equal with all others, it is because of the single-handed efforts of this great and good man.\n\nOn that occasion my heart was too full for words. But I could say with prayerful conviction that this was a full man-living a truly Islamic life and devoting himself to the service of man which ultimately is the one and only way to seek God as enjoined by all the great religions of the world.\n\nSuch then is the pith and substance of this man we never can forget. Generosity was the very nature of his being. He gave away all he had to the people he served, eventually living in a rented room in the last days of his life. And, like an intricately-cut jewel, many other facets of his nature gleamed and glowed and enriched all about him. His love for the beauty of nature led him to cultivate the orchid and learn the many enchanting secrets of the flower.\n\nEven his home in Fareed Place, Bambalapitiya held a small orchidarium where trailing vandas and large-clustered dendrobiums where trailing stars in glorious profusion. How often have I seen him among his orchids, tending them along with his wife, Lady Ameena who shared his love for beauty.\n\nIt was Mr. Eric Garth of Kundasale, Kandy, who at my request, paid gracious tribute to Sir Razik in naming a new hybrid orchid he grew after Sir Razik. To this day, orchild lovers around the world see this clear blue flower with its deep-blue lipped sepals and know it as the Sir Razik Fareed and so does a flower perpetuate his name.\n\nThis orchid was registered with the Royal Horticultural Society of England on 15-11-1984.\n\nFor us, however, he will always be as a flower in our hearts. Sir Razik Fareed was a beacon, a guiding light, a tower of strength, a fortress of courage, a champion that belonged not only to each of us individually but to all the nation and moreso, all the Muslim world.\n\nIt behoves us, surely, that Allah sends us such men with rare frequence and this, the, is our greatest joy - that we in our lifetime have seen the passage of such a man as this. May i conclude by recalling the words of Shakespeare.\n\n\"His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world: 'This was a man'\"\n\nYes, this indeed was a man and, dear brothers and sisters, the mark he has left on all over lives will never be erased:\n\n\"Those who are not grateful to their Fellowmen will not be grateful to Allah\" Nabi Muhammed (O.W.B.P)\n\nThe women who influenced Sir Raziks Family\n\nSir Razik and the Moors claim Arab descendency. But Lady Fareed is the daughter of a Nobleman who sojourned in this country and shared in the work of Ceylon Moors.\n\nThe Government archivist has document which is of Dutch origin, it is the Tombo. It was maintained under the Colombo Dissawany as long ago as the year 1766; details of Sir Raziks ancestry are itemized under the head and Land Tombos of the four Gravets of Colombo. The extract of the document under reference contains the first name Segoe Paridoe.\n\nThe subsequent reference to this line of descendancy appears on 16th March. 1829 when a lady by the name of Thangachy Umma, by her application No. 1585, applied and was granted letters of administration on the even date. She was a widow, having been married to one Wapotchy. She applied for letters of administration as the administratrix of the property of her grandfather Mamouna Pille. The correct name is Mahmud Naina; (Pulle is only an honorific)\n\nThangachy Umma sold by deed No.1585 to one Moetatjie, wife of Asma Marikkar Segoo Pardoo of Colombo, a garden called Ambagahawatte for a consideration of ₤37 equal to 493 Rix Dollars and four fanams. Moetatjie Umma died intestate in 1859. Her son Segoe Paredoe Udema Lebbe Marcar applied to the District court of Colombo for letters of administration. This was application No. 3173 supported by M.F.G Morgan, Proctor, dated 17th August, 1866. This Application contained an annexure giving the names of 43 heirs of Moetatjie Umma which is filed of record. Among these names there appears the name of Sella Umma who was the widow of Aresy Marcar of Slave Island and she is named in the annexure as the daughter in law of Motatjie Umma. Aresy Marcar was Motatjie Ummas son. Yet another heir to these properties was Wapche Marikkar, grandson of Motatjie.\n\nMamouna Pulle referred to above was possessed of vast property. One such property was a land near the former Victoria Memorial Eye Hospital. This area, however, was earmarked under a scheme of widening of roads. It was acquired and the owner was promised compensation. It was agreed by the then Government Agent that he, his heirs or representatives should have a plot of Cinnamon land in the neighborhood. The present Dewatagaha Mosque stands on this land. Justice Berwick in District Court Case No. 61162 dated 15th November, 1873 affirms this compensation was agreed on in 1845 and on this land stood an old grave of Mussulman, which has since then come to be regarded as place of sanctity.\n\nHe further says\n\nit would seem that the administratix Thangachy entered into possession of the ground with the consent Government Agent as an exchange for the land taken by Government and that from that time she and some persons not very well defined either in number or in their connection with the deceased Mamu Nayana, by calling themselves of his famiy or descendents began enhancing the religious character of the place and the collection of offerings and the erection of those buildings which have at length become woven into the present Mosque, but evidently without any but a very vague and indeterminate system of management or responsibility or trusteeship. The usual history in such cases is that some particular old man specially either with the religious sentiments, or the constructive faculty having leisure and taste that way, expands his leisure and energy in what the neighbors look on as the laudable business while at the same time they leave him to work alone at his hobby till it has developed beyond all original contemplation and they step in and claim common credit for it, or, as in this case legal title.\n\nThe late A.M Wapche Marikar had two children by his wife Thangachy Natchia. One was a boy and the other a girl. His son was Named Abdul Raheman and his daughter Mariambu Nachia. Abdul Raheman Married Hajara Umma, elder daughter of Isubu Lebbe Marikkar Hadjiar. They had three children, two girls and one boy. The girls were named Ummu Razeena and Ummu Rakeeba and the Boy Razik.\n\nSir Razik, when he came age, married the grand-daughter of Seyed Abbas, a member of the Dosh Sultan Family. This was a family great renown. Seyed Abbas was very pious. He was used to constant devotion to Allah. He died at Tharaweeh prayers in the Grand Mosque, New moor Street, while prostrating in Sujood.\n\nSeyed Abbas married Muthunga Natchia or Magdoom Natchia, a sister of Naina Marikkar and father of Abu Backer, A.M. Thowfeek, a.M Shahul Hameed and A.M. Kudoos. Seyed Abbas had a daughter named Moomina Umma should marry her cousin, Abu Backer. But owing to a misunderstanding the proposal fell through. Her father, Aeyyed Abbas, looked for a pure Arab for the hand of his daughter. It was this time that Ibraheem bin Ahmed was carrying on successful silk shop in the premises known today as Bulgarian Hotel. Ibraheem bin Ahmed was from Arab country called Zabeedee. He was very prosperous businessman and was investing large sums of money on immovable properties on either road facing his shop. A prominent figure among local Muslim circles, he joined in all their activities. He was very magnanimous with his offers of help for the educational movement, for Zahira College and Hameedia School.\n\nSeyed Abbas married his daughter Moomina Umma to Ibrahim bin Ahmed, a nobleamn of Arab descent. A beautiful daughter, named Amina Umma was born to him. She was destined to become the wife of Sir Razik Fareed in 1913. He was the envy of many suitors.\n\nIbrahim bin ahmeds nephew (his siters son) Abdulla Seyed Mohamed Dawood Al Battah is a Quazi in Crater.Aden. He is very regular correspondent with his cousin, Lady Fareed. Amina Umma or Lady Fareed has a genealogy extending right up to Mohammad (Sal) and her genealogy is given below\n\nThe roots of tree or SHAJARA\n\nMohamed (Sallallahu Alaihi Wa sallam)\n\nFathima (ral)\n\nSeyed Imam Hassan\n\nSeyed Imam Ali Zainul Abdeen\n\nSeyed Imam Mohamed Baqir\n\nSeyed Al Imam Jaffer Us Sadiq\n\nSeyed Ali Ul Aruly\n\nSeyed Mohamed\n\nSeyed Isa Un Naqeeb\n\nSeyed Mohamed Ahmed Muhajir\n\nSeyed Abdullah\n\nSeyed Alavi\n\nSeyed Mohamed Faqihul Muqaddam\n\nSeyed Alavi\n\nSeyed Ali Haliyal Qasam\n\nSeyed Mohamed Sahibul Mirbath\n\nSeyed Ali\n\nSeyed Al Faquihul Muqaddam Mohamed\n\nSeyed Alavi\n\nSeyed Ali Mawlad Dafeela\n\nSeyed Mohamed Sahibul Mirbath\n\nSeyed Abdul Rahman Saqqaf\n\nSeyed Abu Bakr Sakran\n\nSeyed ali\n\nSeyed Hassan\n\nSeyed Omar\n\nSeyed Hussain\n\nSeyed Saleem\n\nSeyed Salih ( of the Damper Sultan Family)\n\nSeyed Abbas (daughter of Moomina married Haji Ibraheem bin Ahmed; their daughter Amina Married A.R.A Razik, Now Sir Razik Fareed)\n\nSir Razik, by this marriage, had one daughter whom he named Hajara.
