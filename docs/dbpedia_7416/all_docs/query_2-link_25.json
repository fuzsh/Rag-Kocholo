        "text": "Abstract: Involuntary body movements including hand flipping, finger flecking, rocking, jumping and pining or twirling may negatively impact social and educational activities of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Kapp, et al., 2019). The study intended to identify the strategies used by the special educationists to manage involuntary body movement of ASD. Employing quantitative research, data was collected from 100 teachers of children with autism from government and private special schools in Lahore District. The researchers employed a stratified sampling method for sampling. The results showed that physical exercise, providing comfortable furniture, using clear directions, remaining calm and peaceful were among the strategies used by majority. Likewise, using therapy balls, squeeze balls, play dough, touch and feel alphabets and letter were used in public and private sector. The findings showed no significant differences in material and techniques used by male and female teachers of govt. and private school having varying teaching experience. Abstract: The main objectives of this study are to shed light on the difficulties of visually impaired students regarding deictic markers in inclusive classrooms and to inform the teachers’ community how effectively they can teach such students. Not much research has been done on this subject, therefore, lack of information regarding special needs of visually defective students creates hurdles for them in getting education. The main idea is that as deictic markers rely mostly on visual cues then how a visually defective student can grasp these markers with equal informativeness. Semi-structured interviews of eight visually impaired students were conducted who were pursuing their education in different universities of Pakistan. More or less all the participants voiced this observation that they have to face a lot of problems in inclusive classrooms due to the use of deictic markers. This study recommends that professional training seminars should be organized to improve the skills of the teachers in tackling such classrooms where visually impaired students are also present. Abstract: Language is the medium for representing identities and ideologies of individuals in a socio-cultural context. This function of language gives the potential to narratives to represent the identity of the character by making use of specific linguistic choices. This paper aims at examining the protagonist's identity shift in Tariq Rehman's short story 'Bingo' written in the socio-political milieu of Dhaka Fall. Halliday's transitivity model (1986) embedded in Systemic Functional Grammar is used as a framework to highlight the actions, thought processes, and relations of the protagonist in changing the socio-political context of 1971 which in turn helps to construe the identity of the individual. The analysis reveals a shift in the protagonist's identity as the incident of the 1971 war and his personal experiences of the war caused a significant change in his character from passive recipient to be the actor of material processes and his increased involvement in mental processes. Abstract: The Antebellum period (1800 – 1860) in American history is marked by the spirit of despondency, disillusionment and dejection due to socio-political narratives of the age.

Abstract: The Human Development, Income Inequality and Economic Growth are inter-related and this paper highlights the role of Human Development in the development of SAARC’s member states. The paper uses comprehensive measures of Human Development and traces out its impact on Economic Growth using panel data model, estimated by Panel Least Square method. The Hausman Test has been used to decide between the selection of Fixed Effects and Random Effect Model. The period of analysis is from 2000 to 2016. The empirical results show that education affects HDI (Human Development Index) significantly. Moreover, when control of corruption variable is excluded from the equations, the results have been unchanged. On the other hand, Income Inequality and Human Development Index (HDI) are negatively correlated. It means that higher income inequality leads to lower HDI. The impact of HDI on Gini coefficient is positive and significant. It means that HDI increase income inequality. However, health variable do not establish statistically valid relationship with Gini coefficient. The relationship between HDI and growth is negative as the impact of one year lag HDI in GDP growth is negative and statistically significant.

Workforce includes female population as well, and one of the issues they face is Glass Ceiling and that leads to low satisfaction and hence towards below average organizational performance. A sample of 225 was selected, and through a valid and reliable instrument, data were collected. The data were screened and then analysis carried out through applying various tests. The results show significant impact of the contributing variables including glass ceiling on the dependent variable. Abstract: The present study was conducted in District Malakand of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in order to assess the effects of land ownership disputes on social structure. Multiple Logistic Regression Model was used to determine the relationship between social structure as the dependent variable and the role of formal institutions, informal institutions, social relationships, and land commercialization as independent variables. Using the Mwakaje (2013) technique, a sample size of 128 respondents was selected from 291 respondents from the civil suit/1 record of Tehsil Dargai. The respondents were chosen using convenience sampling as a method. The model was overall significant as the P-value of Chi-square was statistically significant (P=0. 000) at the 5 percent significance level. A significant relationship was found between land commercialization and its effects on social structure (P=0.04), which is less than 0.05. However, the other variables had no significant relationship with the dependent variable. It is concluded that land commercialization had more effects on social structure as compared to the other variables in causing disputes of ownership over the land. The study recommended that the computerization of land records and creating awareness in people through sound strategies regarding usurping others’ rights in the light of prevalent laws, while taking support from Islamic Sharia are the best solutions to the problem. Abstract: Domestic work is one of the oldest occupations of the informal economy and the number of women in domestic employment is persistently rising. However, the nature of this work, and the problems associated with it, has undergone an immense transformation over the years due to changes in family structures and dynamics. This research is an attempt to examine the issues and challenges faced by domestic workers. A qualitative study of female domestic workers was conducted to achieve this goal. The study addresses several intersected themes such as socio-economic conditions, workplace environment etc. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted and the respondents were selected purposively through snowball sampling. Our findings suggest that paid domestic work is a neglected and highly exploited form of female employment in the informal sector. The findings suggest the need for a sound legal framework on the part of employers as well as for the employees in this sector. Abstract: The main objective of this study was to compare the level of moral development and academic achievement of the children of graduate and undergraduate mothers. There were 1351 7th grade students studying in thirty eight (38) Boys’ elementary schools situated in Tehsil Dera Ghazi khan. 306 students were selected as a sample of this study through Stratified random sampling technique. A moral development scale was used in order to check the level of moral development in the children of graduate and undergraduate mothers. Similarly, the academic achievement of the children was computed on the basis of their previous results. The results showed that the level of moral- development of the children of graduate mothers was poor but with better academic achievement. On the other way the undergraduate mothers’ children were showing better moral development level but with low academic achievement. The study recommended both types of mothers to keep balance while advocating their children about these personas. Abstract: The sole objective of this peculiar research paper is to insinuate a way to improve the speaking capabilities of the Autistic children. Autism targets the speaking competency of the children and is marked with anxiety and repetitive behavior. This work is prolific for the teachers of Autistics, as it incorporates Behavioral operant and reinforcement with CLT techniques to chisel speaking skills in effective manner. Autism has been associated with Verbal Behavior by Skinner and reinforcement has been used before to initiate speaking in Autistic children. Hereby, this research is fusing Behaviorism with CLT technique to devise ways of improving the speaking competence of Autistics. The research is quantitative and questionnaires are used as the major tool of data collection to increase the authenticity of research. The results of this particular research further support the hypothesis of the researcher that integration of these two approaches significantly change the speaking habits of the Autistic children. This work is significant as it not only provides the ways to reduce anxiety and speaking inactivity of Autistic children, but it also paves way for them to be more socially interactive.

In this explanatory research, a model is developed to validate the premise of drafting value-creating supply chain resilience to assist and implement supply chain management strategies in trading companies. The study exploits the primary data source from at least 306 professionals working in Oil and Lubricant Industries in Pakistan. The structural Equation Technique is used to analyze data from the respondents. The research finding depicts that the antecedent of Supply Chain Resilience mediates positively between Supply Chain Capabilities and Supply Chain Performance of the company. Robust Supply Chains have a more positive impact on performance versus Agile Supply Chains. To increase Supply Chain Resilience, companies should make their supply chain more Robust by improving their Supply Chain Capabilities, Risk Strategies as well as Supply Chain Management Strategies. Abstract: The research explores the conceptual grounding of lobbying and propaganda, both distinctively and complimentarily. Propaganda and lobbying are not novel terms for ‘International Relations and Political Sciences’ students, researchers and experts. These terms have often been used to validate the influence one actor has on other states by disseminating information: both true and false. The intended end product of these influences is to affect polices and decision-making processes in one’s own favor or against the conflicting actor. Over the years, during both World Wars and the Cold War, propaganda has remained a major policy tool employed in winning wars or demoralizing the opponents. To that extent, it is also termed ‘soft power’. Despite the use of several tools and techniques in the art of spreading propaganda, mass media has contemporaneously been employed as a vital technique to reach the masses and influence decision makers. Since propaganda campaigns are initiated and organized by authorities or governments to influence the political, social or economic settings of opponents. For that matter, propaganda is also considered as a field or strategy to do successful lobbying. Abstract: Death of Floyd unveils the racial equalities between whites and blacks in the United States. The image of Black Americans as second-class citizens of society has been changed after the murder of George Floyd. The purpose of this qualitative research is to reveal the use of language in the exercise of racial supremacy in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer on May 25, 2020. The data consists of 05 news reports from the Washington post, published in 2020. Using Fairclough’s 3-D model of discourse analysis (1992), the research analysis concentrates on the features and lead passages (the introductory passages of the news reports published in American Print Media during year of 2020) of a corpus of 10 news reports (05 before the event and 05 after the event) and inspects the image of Black (Black People living the United States, where the event took place) after the killing of George Floyd. This study finds that the media is not biased and can change pre-formulated belief systems. Abstract: Item discrimination is an essential technique for making the item analysis for selecting the appropriate items for intelligence test. It helps to identify items which can be revised or discarded, thus building a quality items for IQ assessment tool. The study focussed on item analysis of 100 items of four intelligence types. These items of intelligence test conduct on 1500 people of different age groups adolescence to adulthood. Through item discrimination explored the items discriminatory power with the help of MS excel 2010 and SPSS. Through item analysis we rejected 23 items which item discriminatory power was zero, negative and less than 0.5. item discrimination range in present study was 0.5 -0.45. reliabilities of all types of the intelligence likewise linguistic, observational, mathematical and logical were .88, .80, .89 and .90 respectively. These reliabilities were higher and indicating the present tool of intelligence authentic and reliable. This is a quality assurance test for measuring the individuals intellectual capabilities. Abstract: The purpose of the research study, Stretching before anaerobic events has brought about decreases in performance; be that as it may, the quick impacts of stretching on endurance performance have not been explored. This study researched, the impacts of static stretching on energy cost and endurance performance in prepared female sprinters. Ten prepared female distance sprinters matured years 25±7 with a normal VO2max of 63.8 ± 2.8 ml/kg/min were selected. Participants answered to the lab on 3 separate days. On day 1, anthropometrics and VO2max were estimated. On days 2 and 3, participants played out an hour-long treadmill run randomly under stretching or non-stretching conditions isolated by no less than multi week. Stretching comprised of 16 minutes of static stretching involving 5 activities for the significant lower body muscle gatherings, though non-stretching comprised of 16 minutes of quiet sitting. The run comprised of a 30-minute 65% VO2max preload followed by a 30-minute performance run where participants ran beyond what many would consider possible without review distance or speed. Total calories used were determined for the 30-minute preload run, while performance was estimated as distance canvassed in the performance run. Performance was essentially more prominent in the non-stretching (6.0 6 1.1 km) versus the stretching (5.8 ± 1.0 km) condition (p, 0.05), with altogether more noteworthy energy consumption during the stretching contrasted and the non-stretching condition (425 ± 50 versus 405 ± 50 kcals). Our discoveries recommend that stretching before a n endurance occasion might bring down endurance performance and increase the energy cost of running. Abstract: School performance is largely dependent on the behavior of the leadership of heads and effective behavior yield better school results. The present endeavor was to examine the relationship of leadership behavior and academic achievements of secondary school students in terms of headmasters’ role in the promotion of academic performance. A descriptive-correlational survey design was used to test the null hypothesis. The behavior of school heads was assessed as per the views of teachers. A self-developed research tool i-e questionnaire was distributed to 225 secondary school teachers conveniently taken from 40 secondary schools. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results indicated that a positive relationship of learning behavior, facilitating behavior, and creating behavior with academic performance of schools was found except in influencing leadership behavior, a strong negative relationship has appeared. It implies that learning behavior, facilitating behavior, and creating the behavior of heads have a significant positive impact on the performance of schools. Abstract: Approximately 35(M) people in rural areas are attached with Livestock Sector. The average distribution of livestock holdings per family is 2-3 cattle/buffalo, 3-4 sheep /goats and 10-12 poultry, and its share in the income of those families is approximately 40% (Ministry of Finance, 2020). Development strategy for livestock sector in Pakistan requires technological production, scientific processing and establishment of proper collection/ distribution networks with improving cattle market facilities. Livestock development on scientific basis i.e. adoption of modern techniques of breeding, selection of proper breeds of animal and availability of modern veterinary services at town level will also open enormous avenues for increase in exports of livestock and its by-products. The market of Middle Eastern dominated by countries like India, European Union and Canada could be captured by Pakistan by adoption of proper planning and appropriate policies in accordance with international standards and best practices. In Pakistan livestock sector is struggling with certain issues and challenges which needed to be surfaced out so that these issues could be addressed by the different stakeholders in collaboration of each other. Abstract: Leadership skills strengthen the leadership qualities of a leader. Higher education institutions play an important role in developing leadership skills in students. This study is quantitative. Two-stage random sampling techniques were used to select the study sample from the University of Gujrat. For data collection, an adapted questionnaire was used consisting of a five-point Likert type scale with 28 statements. One Way between groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the difference in leadership skills of class representatives among students of the different semesters. The study's findings show a significant difference in class representatives' leadership skills among students of the different semesters. But when the researcher ran the post hoc Tuckey test to find out the difference between students of different semesters, the researcher observed a statistically significant difference between 2nd and 6th-semester students and in 2nd and 8th-semester students, no statistically significant difference. Abstract: During Pandemic period, online learning wave observed among undergraduate EFL students. Both students and teachers experienced its usefulness in learning and teaching English. The current study is aimed to explore the role of Google-meet class available on computers to improve under undergraduate EFL students of English. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used in this study. Data were collected through questionnaire that had close-ended and open-ended questions. Questionnaires were distributed among 300 undergraduate level EFL students studying at University of South Asia of Punjab, Pakistan.

The results of the study revealed the potential of computer and mobile assisted language instructions as an anticipatory approaches to improve English language. Results indicated that EFL students were more intended to use computers to develop interest for language proficiency. They responded positively about the role of mobile as well as computers to improve English language skills. On the basis of findings, it was concluded that mobile can play result oriented role in improving EFL students’ language proficiency. For future research the study recommended that experimental research might be carried out to analyze the effectiveness of using computers for learning English as foreign language. Abstract: The actions of whistleblowers are potentially beneficial in a developed society but it may not be the case in a developing and underdeveloped society. In a developing society like Pakistan, the scenario of whistle blowing is very much different from the other countries. In an atmosphere of massive corruption, citizens have low confidence in public sector organizations when they are in a need to report wrong doings to the authorities. But one, who takes an initiation for it, has to face certain problems and consequences. This paper aims at investigating the problems and consequences of a whistle blower in a public sector organization at micro level. To explain the said issue, this study was conducted by using qualitative case study method and involved the study of a case in real life. The single instrumental case study was conducted with a woman (daily-wage employee) in a public sector university. The overall procedure for conducting a case study was opted from Creswell’s model (Creswell, 2013). Major derived themes from data were catch 22, hydra-headed administrative system, whistle blower protection and individual problems. It is concluded that in the absence of a proper mechanism for whistle blowing, one has to face the consequences so the researchers suggests that every institution might address the said issues by legislating and implementing whistle blowing to secure the whistle blower rights. Abstract: Human life is of great value in Islam. That is why God has prescribed punishments. In which there is apparently death but in reality there is life in these punishments and sharia system. When we see this sharia system in Chitral, it has been in use for seven centuries. It is a fact that people in mountainous areas are naturally temperamental. But when we look at the people of Chitral, we find opposite to it. That these people, despite living in the rocky valleys of Terich Meir, K2 and Mount Hindu Kush, seem to have a very gentle temperament, a quiet temperament, far from fighting. Therefore, awareness of this fact is very important. What is the secret of this unique quality of the people Chitral, particularly in the country and generally in Asia. Abstract: Good governance is the framework of activities and behaviour of the state institutions with the pursuance of the career of the individuals to achieve the objective of the public good at large. Transparency, accountability and rule of law are the foremost checks in an efficient governance system (Pacific, 2012). Like other public sector departments of the Punjab, governance issues of policing are not unique to the Punjab Police. Mainly, the problems of governance in Punjab Police are due to the inherited legacy of colonial rule and mindset. The paper argues that inadequate and extremely varied ways the Punjab Police exercise its authority in the prevention and detection of crime is the source of dissatisfaction for the general public. The given preferences and adopting the policies to deal the community without considering the ingrediencies of good governance mismatch the Police at par with the community needs. The orthodox police governance is critical in maintaining public trust, upholding human rights, ensuring accountability, transparency, rule of law, and legitimacy (Suddle, Police-Executive Relationship in Pakistan, 2007). Qualitative policing depends on considerable changes in the criminal justice system for re-imaging police perception and impression to achieve the ultimate goal of good governance with transparency, equality and rule of law for the satisfaction of the community. Abstract: This research aimed to explore students' perception of hearing loss about socialization with hearing impaired peers. Socialization is an important contributor for hearing impaired students interacting with hearing peers. Sometimes Hearing impairment cause barriers in communication with hearing peers. That is why it is important to find out about the perception of socialization of hearing students in higher education. The descriptive methodology was used to infer the conclusion in this quantitative research. The researcher developed a self-made questionnaire to explore the perception of hearing students. The population of this research was all the hearing students who had social interaction with hearing-impaired students in an inclusive education setup. Convenient sampling was used to select a sample from hearing students of BS and MA Special education and other programs to collect the data and then analyze by using descriptive and inferential analysis using SPSS. Response of majority students was positive towards the socialization of hearing students with hearing-impaired students at higher education. This research highlighted a new direction for improving socialization among hearing peers and students with hearing impairment. Such an initiative will encourage them to include them in developing countries like Pakistan. Abstract: The study aimed to explore the religious practices to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic and prevalent myths about the pandemic. The study was conducted in Pakistan between January 01 to July 01, 2021. The sample size of the study was 503 respondents from Pakistan, who were approached using online survey method. They data was collected using self-administered questionnaire. The study explored three factors of preventive measures i.e. religious, social and hyper prevention, and two factors of myths i.e. myths and denial, using exploratory factor analysis. The study also explored that the religious prevention from COIVD-19 is higher among females than males. The study concluded that although preventive measures are practiced in Pakistan yet the myths about COVID-19 pandemic are prevalent that may cause the higher prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is suggested to launch a more effective campaign about COVID-19 pandemic engaging religious clerics and medical professionals. Abstract: Battered women’s shelters emerged as a place for victims to escape the violence in their homes as the problem of domestic violence became recognized and discussed in the 1970s. As the result of international feminist movements, many of the early shelters were founded by feminists and proletariat activists. The battered-women’s movement has now spread across much of the globe to provide shelter and advocacy for social transformation. Pakistan also started to establish shelters for battered women in 1960s and has extended the services across the country. This study examined the shelter experiences of battered women in Pakistan and its relationship with international feminist movements’ agenda. Qualitative research design was used to conduct the research. The service providers as well as battered women shared their opinion about shelter services in Pakistan. The study concluded that Pakistani shelter homes are helping women victims of violence to flee from abusive situations, to respite for a while and to think about future but much more is needed to address the real issues of battered women. The study also explored that violence against women is a socio-cultural issue, so it is needed to address violent components prevailing in the society rather than just providing shelter services to battered women. Abstract: The focus of this research is to analyze the relations among three major states America India and China. Increasing Indo-US relations have left spill over implications on China in geostrategic sphere. Since the end of cold war, the dramatic strategic change occurred in the trilateral relations among America India and China. During the cold war period Indian tilt was towards Soviet Union both the states remained strategic allies. The soviet defeat in Cold War created a strategic gape in American foreign policy to filling that strategic gape US deemed India as reliable partner and China as strategic competitor. For Countering China’s economic, political and strategic influence America have established strategic relations with India. The dawn of 21st century gave birth to shocking event of 9/11 that has changed the land scape of geo-political and geostrategic relations among the states; simultaneously Asian continent became singular focus of American policy makers for two reasons; one war on terror and other China’s economic power. Analytical approach has been adopted and descriptive method is used in the research to achieve research objectives. Abstract: The study's major purpose was to assess English instructors' attitudes toward teaching and their influence on students' achievement at the upper secondary level. The research was descriptive in nature. All upper secondary schools in the district Kohat were included in the study's population. As a sample, male and female English teachers from all upper secondary schools were chosen. Questionnaire and results (session 2018-2019) of students were used as research instruments, keeping objectives of the study in mind for data collection. The data was analyzed by using factor analysis, individual correlation analysis and multi group correlation analysis. The study's findings revealed that English teachers had a positive attitude regarding other aspects of their profession. The findings also demonstrated that when gender was taken into account, there were some significant disparities in attitude scores among English teachers. Particularly, females had higher attitude scores than males towards general attitude and factors like academics, administration, co-curricular, and social-psychological. Abstract: Islamic Studies as a vital discipline at secondary and higher secondary level generally focus on the fundamental beliefs of Islam, teachings of Quran, Sunnah, and Hadith. The examining body at Intermediate and Secondary level is Board of Secondary and Intermediate Education, Karachi. There is an immediate need to analyze the examination papers of Islamic Studies conducted by Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Karachi. It is a continuous process. The specific objectives of the study were to analyze the examination papers of Islamic Studies in light of the educational objectives of the Bloom's Taxonomy.A check list was developed. It was found that in multiple choice questions (objective items) generally knowledge domain was assessed in the examination papers of Islamic Studies. In subjective component (short answer questions and long questions) comprehension and application domains are assessed. The higher abilities, like, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation are generally ignored. It is therefore recommend that attention will be made to focus on all cognitive domains along with the prescribed guidelines given by curriculum authorities. Abstract: The objectives of the study were to find out the effect of feedback specificity on students’ academic self-efficacy and to find out the interaction effects of ability and feedback specificity on students’ academic self-efficacy. The study was experimental and 2x2 factorial design was used. The target population of the study was comprised of all the female students registered in the program F.A Part-II with the elective subject of education at university of Gujrat. Sample of the study was comprised of 48 students. All the students included in the sample were divided into two groups (i.e. High achievers and Low achievers). Secondly, all the students of F.A Part-II (Section B) were selected randomly to constitute two groups (experimental and control group). In this way, both experimental and control groups consisted of twenty four (24) students. For data collection instrument named “The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)” was adapted by the researcher. The study's main results concluded that different strategies of feedback specificity remained significant and enhanced students’ academic self-efficacy. It is recommended that institutions for intermediate level should include elaborative feedback strategies as part of the teaching learning process. Abstract: The most important objective of this research is to make critical analysis of the laws addressing to this problem. A fraction of the horrific fines enforced by the brutal Hudood treachery commands were abolished by the 2006 Act for the Protection of Women. The purpose of the study is to highlight violence in Pakistan on women, which is generating human distress and preventing women from working. The research method for the suggested issue covers descriptive nature. For the compilation of data, all primary and secondary outlets are used which include observation, books, research papers, posts and official records. Since there are laws and ordinances present, we need to put them in action .Furthermore, even in the laws present, there are loopholes that we need to highlight so that they are implemented. Taking everything into respect, the practice of present acts is important for a safe future of women in Pakistan. Abstract: Pakistan is a multicultural, multilingual and multiethnic society, therefore, code switching (CS) is a common feature of the Pakistani society. The study has deployed the qualitative and quantitative methods to answer the research questions. The data was collected from the undergraduate students and their teachers of two public sector universities located in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The findings reveal that both undergraduate students and university teachers are using CS as a tool beneficially for multiple reasons in universities such as, teaching, translation, classroom discussion, comprehension, and explanation, conversation, asking for clarification and responding to teachers’ questions. The code switching alleviates students’ language anxiety. It is recommended that CS as an effective bilingual strategy of teaching should be included in teacher education programs to train the university faculty members for implementing it successfully in their classrooms for achieving the objectives of their academic courses. Abstract: The actual problem is that there is no culture of stimulating the intolerant discourse which has formed a violent Pakistani society and it has challenged the liberal values of the state. The radical’s narrative is based on the concept that Pakistan is an Islamic country, only way of being a good Muslim, and to create an ideal Islamic state which denounces the western ideas of democracy and liberalism. There are number of internal and external factors which helped to radicalize the already polarized society, resulted in extremism, sectarianism and militancy. Military and political leadership helped to patronage radicals for their own benefits. The moderate and liberal voices of the society are forced to remain silent and this silence is interpreted as the support of the radicals by the West. Radical’s strong hold and lack of unified approach to contain them caused serious problems. This paper aims to explain the radical’s narrative and find a counter narrative of moderate and liberal Pakistan. Abstract: This study analyzed socio-economic and institutional factors that affect the quality of education in government primary schools in the Naseerabad division, Balochistan. For this purpose, a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussion and interview guide were used to collect data from 272 respondents from the two districts of the Naseerabad division. The information gathered through the questionnaire was analyzed using frequency distribution, percentage, mean, correlation, and logistic regression. The logistic regression analysis results indicate a positive association between quality education and a well- trained teacher, effective school administration, teaching-learning materials, physical facilities, parental and community involvement in the educational process, a learning-friendly family environment, and family income. On the other hand, teacher absenteeism, an outdated curriculum, and a flawed examination system were negatively associated with quality education. Moreover, data collected through group discussions and in-depth interviews were analyzed using the thematic analysis method. Based on the findings, it is recommended that government needs to appoint competent, trained and qualified teachers to improve the quality of education. Abstract: The current study calculated the asymmetric effect of Oil Price on the Stocks Market of the USA from 1996 to 2009 by applying the asymmetric Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) co-integration technique. The generated results proved the long-term asymmetries between Oil price and Stock Market Index. Oil Price shocks affect the stock market of the USA significantly and positively. Both negative and positive Oil Price shocks have a positive effect on the stock market index of the USA. By applying the Phillips and Peron (PP) Unit root Test it is concluded that data is stationer at mixture which allowed to apply the ARDL technique. After applying the Bound test study move towards NARDL to verify the long-term relationship between Oil Price and Stock Market Index. The dependent variable is Stock Market Index, the Main independent variable is Oil Price and other related independent variables are the Exchange rate and Foreign Direct Investment. In this way, positive and negative prices of oil shock waves are advantageous for the oil exporters like the USA. The effect of FDINI is also favorable since once foreign investors finance in the host country then job opportunities, employment, income and purchasing power increase and then economic development and export also increase Abstract: To assess the parent’s knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding childhood acute respiratory Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of pediatric mortality and morbidity, particularly when associated with delays in treatment Control of acute respiratory infections (ARI) is a major public health problem in developing countries. A descriptive cross-sectional survey study design was used in which 150 parents were selected for the study through simple random sampling technique and the sample size was calculated by Rao soft with confidence interval and margin of error. In this study total 150 participants were included in which there were 36 males and 64 females. There were more than half of the participants had poor knowledge related to ARIs. The majority participants had negative attitude toward consulting a physician. This study result shows that half of the participants had poor knowledge and rest had good knowledge regarding childhood acute respiratory infections. Most of the participants had negative attitude towards the consulting a physician Abstract: This study aimed to explore the relationship between factual autonomy (FA), organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and Counterproductive work behaviour (CWB) in industry workers, possibly mediated by burnout. Participants included 600 industry workers (300 from local and 300 from multinational industries), age 25 through 40 years, with a minimum experience of one year of working on the same position. Organizational Citizenship Behavior Checklist (OCB-C), Factual Autonomy Scale (FAS), Counterproductive Work Behavior Checklist (CWB-C), and Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) were used to collect data from the participants. The results indicated that, more FA is likely to result in significantly more OCB, significantly lesser CWB and significantly lesser burnout in industry workers. Similarly, an increase in burnout is likely to predict a significant decrease in OCB and significant increase in CWB of industry workers. Further, burnout significantly mediated the relationship between FA and OCB as well as FA and CWB. In a rapidly changing post-covid world, such studies are very important to inform policy makers and have important implications for industrial/organizational psychologists and consultants like defining the limit of autonomy for industry workers, keeping a check on burnout and CWB while striving for more OCB. Abstract: Environmental concerns have become the central point of discussion for businesses because climate change results from negligence by the industries have put the planet at stake. To survive in this era, stakeholders have started pressuring the firms to adopt environmentally friendly practices to save the planet and build a positive image among the customers. This study has used the framework of Dynamic capabilities (DC) to examine the hypotheses extracted from the previous literature suggesting the nexus of environmental ethics and performance in building competitive advantage through the help of green HRM practices. The findings of our study reveal that environmental ethics and performance have a significant impact on competitive advantage. The study also revealed that green HRM practices of an organization moderates the relationship between environmental ethics and performance on a firm's competitive advantage. The study results suggest that the organizational approach towards environmental and ethical practices in the workplace should not be reactive but proactive to create and sustain synergy amongst the triads, namely, profits, society, and the environment. Green HRM practices should be adopted effectively to beat the competition and improve environmental performance in the organization.

Findings of this study show that ethical responsibility has a significant positive influence on organization effectiveness. Second hypothesis of this research was to check relation between economical responsibility and organizational effectiveness. The findings of this study will defiantly help to bring aware among government employees regarding CSR. Abstract: This study is based on the scenic analysis of Bollywood motion picture ‘Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India’. The study attempts to highlight the historical instances of marginality of people of India and to unearth the aspects of oppression and exploitation at the hands of the British colonizers. Employing some relevant assumptions from Edward Said’s phenomenal work ‘Orientalism’, the researchers have weaved a framework to conduct an in-depth analysis of marginality of the Indians as depicted in the film understudy. The study inkles towards the oppressive strategies of the non-natives (colonizers) to keep the natives (colonized) subjugated and weak thereby augmenting their cultural, social and psychological oppression. It also suggests that the binary of the strong/weak, rational/irrational, civilized/barbaric and decent/indecent is so hardwired that it is mighty hard to deconstruct. This research is likely to give a new angle to this text thereby enriching its scope and understanding. Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to analyze the developing Sino-Iranian comprehensive strategic relations. An attempt has been made to rationally forecast the implications of this growing partnership on the regional actors, particularly India. Recent developments in South Asia and Middle East have attracted the attention of global academia. The rise of China as a major regional economic power and her pursuits in building new alliances in the South Asia and Middle East have started changing the power dynamics in the region. The developments in Sino-Iran bilateral relations have alarmed many regional and global actors. The article is mainly based on secondary sources and arguments have been developed by juxtaposing the information collected through books, newspapers and journal articles with personal reflections.

Abstract: The world witnessed two horrific and the deadliest days for the mankind during March and April of 2019 when more than 321 innocent lives of Muslim and Christian worshipers were lost to the hands of religious extremists. Both the Muslims and the Christian were attacked while busy in their worships on their respective religious sacred days. The attacks contained clear intentions of exacerbating religious polarization in both the societies. The media around the globe vigorously and meticulously reported and commented on the incidents and produced a variety of discourses ranging from the ‘white supremacy’ to the ‘Islamist terrorism’ to the ‘polarization’ and to the need of ‘social solidarity’. Mass Media researchers around the globe have explored and analyzed these discourses and have determined the role of media in these critical times. This study is an attempt to find out whether and to what extent the New Zealand and the Sri Lankan media have performed the role of ‘civil repair’ by producing the ‘solidarity discourse’ as proposed by Jeffery Charles Alexander. Or, they have produced the ‘othering discourse’ as argued by Edward Wadie Said. Commissioning the ‘lexicalization’ and the ‘ideological square’ techniques from the Critical Discourse Analysis proposed by Teun Adrianus van Dijk the researcher has examined the editorials and the op-eds from the selected New Zealand and Sri Lankan newspapers. The findings are interesting in a sense that in case of the Christchurch shootings the ‘civil repair’ function of journalism is proved. While, in case of the Easter Sunday shootings in Sri Lanka the ‘othering’ is the predominant discourse. Abstract: The aim of this research is to analyze the impact of initiation of SPS and TBT by China for its import, during 1995 to 2018. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement and Technical Barrier to Trade by the World Trade Organization have restricted the Chinese trade. In general, it is perceived that non-tariff measure barricade trade. Using the PPML estimation process to manage the zero import flow, and over-dispersion in data of China depend on the gravity model. Results witness that GDP of China and partners, tariff, exchange rate, and distance are core determinants; SPS and TBT initiated and levied by China have affected imports from the WTO members. Results states that China has initiated SPS and TBT, hence country has experienced lower imports. The study also depicts comparative analysis of Chines initiated SPS and TBT effects on import from the high income, upper middle, lower middle, and low income countries. SPS and TBT are equally good as tariff, but China should focus more on NTMs because tariff would decline gradually in WTO regime. Abstract: Right to health is protected under the international law and World Health Organization (WHO) bounds the member states to ensure the basic health facilities to its citizens. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are also protected internationally under the umbrella of WTO.

Abstract: Primary motive of temporary migration in developing countries like Pakistan is generally in response to the income constraint faced by the households. Therefore, to relax the resource constraint, migrants tend to remit back to their families in home countries. This study attempts to look at the impact of remittances on child health outcomes as measured by height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) & weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) in Punjab, Pakistan using a cross-sectional data set from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). We use an instrumental Variable Approach to correct for the endogenous decision to remit. Two Stage Least Square with an instrument that comprise of an interaction of number of banks in each district with the number of adult males in a household to create household level variation in the instrument has been used to estimate the causal relation between remittances and child’s health outcomes. Our results suggest significant positive impact of remittances on both indicators of child health outcomes. Further this study confirms that gains for girls are greater relative to boys. Abstract: Streets are the most important part of the urban environment. Streets, in the past, were the places of informal meetings, kids' play, social gatherings, and processions.
