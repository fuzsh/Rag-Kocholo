        "text": "Roaming around on the second floor of Imtiaz Market, a bookworm like me can never stop themselves from peeking into the bookstore corner every once in a while. Once I so happened to be there casually running my fingers over the hardcovers of the books like a giddy little child who is left alone in an aisle in Toys’ R Us. As I was going over the one of the blurbs of one of the books, I noticed people giving me the stares and funny looks. So needless to say it got my interest in the book piqued. Now all I had to do was remember the book’s name and see for myself that what it is about this book that has got people so cooped up. The name was Fifty Shares of Grey or something like that I guess..\n\n“Have you read Fifty Shades?” was a very popular whisper up until a few months ago. Especially among the fans following Twilight and/or Sidney Sheldon books. The Fifty series is one of the most quickly and yet quietly (mind you) selling trilogy written. Let’s not get into why that is. The popularity of the series is just one side of the fun. What’s even more astounding is the secrecy of it. Have you ever walked into a bookstore and see people reading the blurb of any one of the books of the series? Ever saw anyone reading the book openly in a library or a park even? I didn’t think so either. It’s definitely not your typical “The Notebook”, by Nicholas Sparks the one with which can be read anywhere at any time. (For those of you who haven’t read The Notebook, it’s the one where the poor Ryan Goslings dares to date the rich and pretty Rachel McAdams.) And yet, despite the taboo status of the series many of us have read the trilogy and many more are desperately waiting for the movie. Again, let’s not get into the why.\n\nOn the other hand we have no issues reading, recommending or even openly discussing books like ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ by John Green. A literary paragon of romanticism, the book tells a breath-taking story of two star-crossed lovers. It is a perfect blend of emotions and yet the book never loses its touch of tragic realism. Despite the inevitable impending doom the book manages to keep a smile on the readers face through the amusing characters and closer to life analogies. The Notebook on the other hand, describes the feelings of the main characters of the story in excruciating length often which at most part is tedious to keep track off. No offence to Mr. Nicholas Sparks.\n\nNow most readers may find it offensive to find that we have dared to compare untainted ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ to a scandalous book like ‘Fifty Shades’. The audacity of the writer! But aren’t they both just romantic novels? Perhaps the only thing common in both books is the level of attraction the main characters play for their counterparts despite the physical or emotional damages residing in them. In the essence of it, The Fault in our Stars rides the emotional rollercoaster faced by a young couple which deals with cancer, and on the other hand if critically viewed (major emphasis on the ‘if’), Fifty Shades narrates a story of a couple dealing with inherent emotional damages; albeit in a very controversial way. However, this only depends on the perception of the reader.\n\nEven though the books somehow share a common ground, they definitely are not treated as the same. It’s interesting to note that despite the unmentionable status of Fifty Shades, the book has a rating almost equal to that of ‘The Notebook’ or ‘The Faults in our Stars’. Even the movie of the former is now being eagerly anticipated by readers and even non-readers. What would be even more ridiculously interesting to see is how many of you actually have it in you to make it to the first screenings of Fifty shades in your respective cities..\n\nWritten by\n\nIqra Saeed ( North Campus, Iqra University )\n\nYou see them every day, you talk to them every now and then, and you get to listen their names at the end of every mastery. They breathe the way you breathe, they excel the way you excel, and they eat, laugh, cry, move, jump and run the way you do.\n\nBut still what is that thing which makes them stand out among the crowd?\n\nWhy people like them or find them inspirational? Why people look up to them for inspiration or motivation?\n\nOr why people include them in their list of favorite personalities?\n\nThis is actually because… They love. They lead. They speak the truth. They live their values. They innovate. They simplify. They adore mastery. They release mediocrity. They always aim for the highest. They stay humble. They would be even kinder than you expected. They deliver more than is needed. They exude passion. They shatter their limits. They transcend their fears. They inspire others by their bigness. They dream big. And the best of all… They act now… they don’t stop and… they change the world.\n\nThese great and lively people and the super achievers from Iqra University deserve a prodigious tribute for the new level of productivity and dramatic triumphs. And at every stages of life, they are making Iqra University proud by their greatness.\n\nNow, let’s see who these favorite personalities of IU are and why, chosen by the beautiful people of Iqra University themselves:\n\nSumbul Iqbal ( IULS, Volunteers Head )\n\nSir Durrani, he is one of the best teacher. he teaches difficult management concept in very simple n easy way that it stays in students mind forever. he is very friendly and very humble. Dr Kashif Mehmood, he is one of the most amazing teacher. he taught me CCM, IB and SM. he is very friendly, down to earth n always ready to help his students. he teaches in such an easy way that anyone can understand it. he puts his heart n soul in teaching every student n makes lesson easiest to understand n makes student enjoy learning.\n\nHammad Bin Syed ( Faculty Member )\n\nDr. Akif, he is Yes-Man, a problem solver humble & down to earth. A visionary. Mam Rosy Malik ,she is like a mother to me. When you tell her a problem, its no more your problem. My Coach, My guru . She has got a huge hEART. Sir Durrani, My Guru, My Ustaad, My inspiration. just cant express in words my gratitude. He is one of the reasons why iqrianz are now recognized in the corporate sector. I took an additional elective in HR because my friends used to say “DURRANI SE NAHEEN PARHA TAU MBA BEKAR HAI”.\n\nDanish Maqsood ( President, IULS )\n\nMa’am Rosy Malik, My mentor. My Guru. My Coach. A Saviro to me. She is someone who has taught me 95 percent of the things that I know. I give her a large chunk of my success to her because she really made me learn that what life is all about. She introduced me to the mystic world of Spirituality, Sufism, Mind Sciences and Hypnosis. She is the first person who said to me “Son, you’re made for Media and Arts, your wasting your time in BBA. You should switch to Media Sciences” . And that’s exactly what I did. I am extremely thankful to her for always being there when I needed her. I love and respect her like anything. She is indeed like a mother to me. Hammad Bin Syed, An inspiring personality. A great friend and brother to me. The best event organizer ever. He can even be called as the pioneer of events in IU. I think he’s one of those few people who are born with built-in leadership qualities. If Mr. Bin Syed is organizing an event, you just cant afford to miss it. Dr Tanveer Anjum, I am a huge fan of her work. She is an amazing writer and poet. She has published over 5 poetry books and yet she is such a down to earth and sweet person, that really inspires me. Saad Qamar Bhatti, I think he’s quite hardworking. I am kinda impressed with the work he has done in IU Societies. Moazzam Ali, I think he’s the most hardworking photographer in IU. A great friend and brother to me. And last but not the least Zamy Khan, my best friend who is more than a brother to me. An insanely talented photographer and animator. He’s someone that I can count on all the time.\n\nUroosa Yousuf ( IULS, Management Team )\n\nDr.Kashif Mehmood, he is one of the best and friendliest teacher, extremly humble, he taught me HRM, CCM, IB.. his way of teaching is the greatest.. his international experience from around the world helps in every situation and makes lesson easy to understand.

The best thing about her is she knows how to handle everyone she meets. She is very genuine and forthright which is a rare quality I believe. Adnan Butt, I believe he is the best option when it comes to teaching statistics. I remember I was so dumb in mathematical subjects but he put forth all his efforts and now my concepts are very much clear and yes I remember students begging for one mark and you’re always like I never do favoritism , I won’t give you marks unless you earn it. Sir, you’re very tranquil and quiet which is your distinctive quality I guess.\n\nSaad Qamar Bhatti ( MBA , IU )\n\nMam Rosy Malik, One of the most inspiring person for me, a sincere teacher and a mother to me. Since the starting of the MUN, she is the only person who motivated me and groomed my talent for the events. She is the most favorite personality of mine from Iqra University.Love you mam for everything you did for me and gave me chances to prove myself. Sir Yaseen Turabi, This person is popular for the most strict marking and confusing exam paper making. But for me he is the true knowledge giver with the perfect understandings. I have covered many courses with Sir Turabi and yes I managed some how to score good marks. My experience with him is like I can never forget those lectures thought by him, his style of teaching inspired me alot and make my grip strong over the course, and i succeeded. He is the most influential lecturer of Iqra University and a greatest asset. Imaduddin Siddique, An inspiring colleague, friend, class mate, batch mate or brother to me. Have learned alot from him, he guided me generously when ever and where ever i needed him. Immo bhai you are my favorite personality from IU and from MUN circuit.\n\nObaid Chawla ( Guest Speaker Society, IU )\n\nBin Syed, beneath that smiling face, buried inside those glowing ambitions, lies a emotional man, who hates to treat anyone else the way he would not like himself to be treated, thats what tapers him off from his peers. Yaruq Sohail, doing extraordinary work and not wanting any recognition for it is a virtue no human in the ‘i’ age possesses. this guy with an unassuming demeanor does exactly that. This person knows the corporate world like the back of his hand and is miles ahead of his contemporaries and his seniors in that regard.\n\nJunaid Malik ( General Secretary, IULS )\n\nSir Zubair Ahmed is an outstanding teacher and a excellent religious host also. Such a nice multi talented teacher I ever seen till now.\n\nNafees Khalfan ( IU Music Society )\n\nThey are the teachers who teach students like their own children and they understand students mentality and maturity Sir Rehan is not only like our teacher but also our guider who guide us in our hard times and where as Sir Muiz Alam, the person who corporate with students and teach them with his practical and live examples which help us to learn more and it also help us in our practical lives.\n\nZamy Khan ( Creative Team, IULS )\n\nMuhammad Ehtesham Khan, he is more than a best friend a true caring and a very responsible person.

He became one of the most famous personalities in IU by giving his immense services for IU. He has written ample amount of blogs and write ups for many events of IU which became very famous and were shared by the celebrity social media pages.\n\nSumair Malik ( IU Alumni )\n\nI would say Bilal Fazal is one of my favorite personalities, an absolute gem of a guy with zero attitude, knows his job well and is always there to guide you.\n\nFatima Shabbir ( BMS Dept , IU )\n\nMa’am Tehmina Lodhi she has a descent a personality.
