        "text": "Use of internet by the teaching faculty of Peshawar Medical College, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nJan, Saeedullah; Hussain, Abid; Ibrahim, Muhammad; Saeed, Sarah\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis study was planned to examine the hard and soft form of learning resources available on the internet accessed by the teaching faculty. This study was conducted at the Peshawar Medical College, Peshawar, Pakistan from January 2to April 2017. As the target population was not too large, no sampling technique was employed and census-based approach was adopted. For data collection, the pre-tested questionnaire was distributed among 115 faculty members of both basic and clinical sciences groups with a response rate of 66(57.39%). Data was analysed using SPSS. Among the respondents, 38(57.6%) were males and 28(42.4%) were females. A majority 51 (77.27%) of the respondents used the internet for teaching and research. Library was the most frequently 22 (33.33%) used place for the internet use. Low internet speed, virus on computers and a lack of modern trainings were the major barriers. E-journals, e-books, online databases and theses and dissertations were the major sources consulted by the participants.\n\nChemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay based detection and prevalence of HCV infection in district Peshawar Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Due to the high rate of asymptomatic infections an advanced screening assay is of prompt importance to be used for the clinical diagnosis of HCV. Early detection of anti HCV is the first step in the management of chronic hepatitis and in the selection of patients needing treatments. In the current study we have first time used the advanced serological diagnostic technique i.e. Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno Assay (CMIA) for the detection of HCV infection in Peshawar Pakistan. Methods A total number of 982 samples were collected among the general public belongs to the different areas of district Peshawar. The samples were centrifuged at high speed to obtain a clear supernatant serum. All the samples were run on Architect system a fully automated immuno analyzer CMIA base technology. Results Out of 982 blood samples analyzed in this study, 160 (15.9%) were confirmed to be positive for active HCV infection. The overall prevalence was found to be 13.4%. Gender wise prevalence was recorded to be higher in male (19.1%) than female (12.7%). The age group 21-30 years was identified as the highest risk group among the studied population. Conclusion Among the tested samples, overall prevalence of active HCV infection was found to be 13.4% in the general population of Peshawar Pakistan. The young middle aged population of this region was at higher risk of HCV ailments compared to the other age groups.

To determine the quality of water, 4 enteric viruses were studied from different localities of Peshawar, Pakistan. The study validates the viral detection method for Rotavirus (RV), Human adenovirus (HAdV), Enterovirus (EV) and Hepatitis A virus (HAV), directly from water sources of rural areas of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan. Overall, 95 five water samples were tested; among them, 9.47% were positive for RV, 38.94% for HAdV, 48.42% for EV and 12.63% for HAV. The presence of these viruses in water was directly correlated with meteorological data. High prevalence of EV and HAdV was detected frequently in the wet season from May - September, which can be the potential cause of spreading of gastroenteritis in the population. Environmental surveillance is an additional tool to evaluate the epidemiology of enteric viruses circulating in a given community.\n\nNutritional and mental health status of Afghan refugee children in Peshawar, Pakistan: a descriptive study.\n\nPubMed\n\nIzutsu, T; Tsutsumi, A; Sato, T; Naqibullah, Z; Wakai, S; Kurita, H\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe study sought to ascertain and describe the physical and mental health states of Afghan refugee children after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 in the US and the aerial bombing of Afghanistan that followed. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in four refugee camps in Peshawar, Pakistan from February to March 2002, and comparisons among camps were made. A total of 70 males (mean age SD = 9.81 +/- 1.98 years old) and 30 females (7.94 +/- 2.07) answered a self-developed questionnaire on demographic data, traumatic events experience, living environment in the camps, and physical and mental health, through interviews. Anthropometric measures were measured and physical symptoms including anaemia and edema were assessed. Severe malnutrition was not shown and there were no significant differences in most nutritional and physical states among the camps. Nevertheless, in the newer camps more children experienced war related traumatic events. Mental symptoms were prevalent in all camps, though the characteristics of the symptoms differed among the camps.\n\nExperiences of the Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy at a Public Hospital Peshawar Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHabibullah, Gulzar; Gul, Raisa; Cassum, Shanaz; Elahi, Rehana\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjective: This study aimed to explore the experiences of female breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) in a public hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methods: This study employed a descriptive exploratory method. A purposive sample of 14 breast cancer women undergoing RT was selected for this study. Data were collected over the period of 5 months, using a semi-structured interview guide and conducting in-depth face-to-face interviews. These interviews were audio taped and transcribed by a bilingual transcriber. The translated version of the interview was coded, and the analysis was done manually. Results: Four main categories emerged from data analysis, which were: feelings and perceptions of the patients, their challenges, coping strategies, and teaching and informational needs. Conclusions: Women undergoing RT in this culture experience more intense psychological effects, as compared to the physical effects. Keeping in mind, the magnitude of the emotional stress experienced by the participants, recommendations for policy reforms, and training for female RT staff are suggested based on findings of this research.

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB Unit, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan and included all MDR-TB patients registered between January 2012 and December 2012. A special proforma was used for data collection. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 16, after exporting data from the proforma. Differences in proportions were assessed using Pearsonâs Chi square test whereas for predictors of poor outcomes, multivariate logistic regression analysis with Wald Statistical criteria using backward elimination method was performed. Results: The treatment success rate was 74.3%. In univariate analysis, poor outcomes were associated in patients with age â¥44 years (odds ratio [OR]=0.250; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.114-0.519, p=0.001), rural residence (OR=0.417; 95% CI: 0.18-0.937, p=0.03), lung cavitation (OR=0.22; 95% CI, 0.007-0.067, p=0.001), resistance to second line drugs (SLD) (OR=3.441; 95% CI: 1.579-7.497, p=0.001), and resistance to ofloxacin (OR=2.944; 95% CI: 1.361-6.365, p=0.005); whereas multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor outcomes were associated in patients with age â¥44 years (OR=0.249, 95% CI: 0.075-0.828, p=0.023), rural residence (OR=0.143, 95% CI: 0.052-0.774, p=0.032), and cavitatory lungs (OR=0.022, 95% CI: 0.007-0.072, p=0.000). Conclusion: The MDR-TB patient needs special attention for better treatment outcomes. The presence of older age, rural area residence, resistance to ofloxacin, SLD resistance, and cavitary disease are independent prognostic factors for poor outcome in patients with MDR-TB.

Research methods included analysis of the Emergency Pediatric Services' admission register, a structured interview administered to 47 parents of patients seen in the Khyber Medical College Teaching Hospital, semi-structured interviews of 12 staff, and four home visits among families with children treated at the hospital. The use of native research assistants and participant observation contributed to the reliability of the findings, though the ethnographic, home-visit sample is small. Our research indicated that infection rates are exacerbated in homes through two culturally salient practices and one socioeconomic condition. Various misconceptions propagate the recurrence or perserverance of acute gastroenteritis including assumptions about teething leading to poor knowledge of disease etiology, rehydration solutions leading to increased severity of disease, and diaper usage leading to the spread of disease. In our Discussion, we suggest how hospital structures of authority and gender hierarchy may impact hospital interactions, the flow of information, and its respective importance to the patient's parents leading to possible propagation of disease. These ethnographic data offer a relatively brief but targeted course of action to improve the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts.\n\nMEASLES IN VACCINATED CHILDREN 1.5 TO 3 YEARS OF AGE IN RURAL COMMUNITY OF DISTRICT PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Aftab; Ullah, Obaid; Ambreen; Ahmad, Israr; Merajuddin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn many developing countries measles is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Despite of vaccination thousands of children have been infected by measles virus during last couple of years in Pakistan. The objective of this study was to determine the measles vaccination coverage rate and frequency of measles among vaccinated children of age 1.5-3 years in rural community of district Peshawar. The cross-sectional study was carried out among 385 children aged 1.5-3 year of rural community of Peshawar. After taking informed consent from parents/guardians a predesigned questionnaire was filled. Evidence of vaccination and measles history was taken by vaccination card, doctor prescription and parent/guardian recall. Data was gathered and analysed by using SPSS-16. Of the 385 children, 361 (93.7%) were vaccinated against measles at 9 month. It was found that 27 (7.48%) vaccinated children had measles history of which 23 (6.74%) were infected after 9 month vaccination. One hundred and ninety-two (49.8%) children were vaccinated both at 9 and 15 months, and 14 (7.29%) dual vaccinated children had a measles history, 9 among them (4.68%) were infected after taking both measles doses. The occurrence of measles among vaccinated children and low coverage rate of second dose of measles vaccine raises many questions about vaccination program and its efficacy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of other predisposing factors like vaccine quality, manufacturer, supply, cold chain, handling, nutritional status of children and technical approach, on measles vaccine efficacy.\n\nHomicidal deaths by firearms in Peshawar: an autopsy study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHussain, Zahid; Shah, Mian Mujahid; Afridi, Hakim Khan; Arif, Muhammad\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMedico legal autopsies can be valuable sources of information about the distribution of causes of reported deaths, particularly in homicidal cases. The present study provides information regarding the homicidal deaths due to firearm injuries in the district of Peshawar, NWFP, Pakistan. This descriptive study was conducted over the period of the year 2004. Data were collected from the autopsy records of the Department of Forensic Medicine, Khyber Medical College Peshawar and included all reported unnatural deaths from urban and rural areas of district Peshawar on whom autopsies were conducted in the department. Homicidal deaths constituted 77.7% (492/633) of all autopsies for the year 2004. Of 492 homicidal deaths, a vast majority of 452 (91.87%) were caused by firearm injuries. Among these, the male to female ratio was 5.5:1. The most common firearm weapon (418/452, 92.5%) were high velocity rifled weapons (Kalashnikov, rifles, pistols), followed by low velocity rifled weapons (18/452, 3.98%) and shotguns (16/452, 3.54%). A total of 956 injuries were found in various body areas, giving an average of over two injuries per person. The head, face and neck sustained the highest injuries (257, 26.9%), followed by the chest (248, 25.9%) and abdomen (149, 15.6%); the extremities, buttocks and genitalia together sustained 302 (31.6%) injuries. The vast majority of reported homicides in Peshawar are caused by firearm injuries, which bring up issues related to possession of firearms and changes in cultural attitudes towards use of firearms, if a decrease in firearm-related homicides is desired.\n\nConnecting Classrooms: Bringing Together Bradford and Peshawar, Primary and Secondary Schools, History and English\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nExcell, Dianne\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this article, Dianne Excell shares her experience of a cross-phase, collaborative project funded by the British Council that brought together teachers and pupils from three schools in Bradford and five schools in Peshawar, Pakistan.

Other new ages confirm that PPAIP rift-related igneous activity was Permian and lasted from Ë290 Ma to Ë250 Ma. Although PPAIP rocks are petrologically and geochemically typical of rifts and have been suggested to be linked to rifting on the Pangea continental margin at the initiation of the Neotethys Ocean, there are no documented rift-related structures mapped in Permian rocks of the Peshawar Plain. We suggest that Permian rift-related structures have been dismembered and/or reactivated during shortening associated with India-Asia collision. Shortening in the area between the Main Mantle Thrust (MMT) and the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) may be indicative of the subsurface northern extension of the Salt Range evaporites. Late Cenozoic sedimentary rocks of the Peshawar Plain deposited during and after Himalayan thrusting occupy a piggy-back basin on top of the thrust belt. Those sedimentary rocks have buried surviving evidence of Permian rift-related structures. Igneous rocks of the PPAIP have been both metamorphosed and deformed during the Himalayan collision and Cenozoic igneous activity, apart from the newly recognized Gohati volcanism, has involved only the intrusion of small cross-cutting granitic bodies concentrated in areas such as Malakand that are close to the MMT. Measurements on Chingalai Gneiss zircons have confirmed the occurrence of 816 Â± 70 Ma aged rocks in the Precambrian basement of the Peshawar Plain that are comparable in age to rocks in the Malani igneous province of the Rajasthan platform Ë1000 km to the south.\n\nBaseline for Monitoring Water Resources Along Kabul and Indus Rivers of Pakistan for Potential Terrorist Contamination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHamidullah, S.; Tariq, S.; Shah, M. T.; Bishop, M. P.; Kamp, U.; Olsenholler, J.\n\n2002-05-01\n\nBaseline for Monitoring Water Resources Along Kabul and Indus Rivers of Pakistan for Potential Terrorist Contamination Terrorism has temporarily constrained the dynamism of the world it was enjoying before September 11, 2001, but also has opened avenues for people of all ethnicities, creeds, and professions to join hands in combating it. Scientific efforts to combat terrorism are likely to lead to better use of existing scientific knowledge as well as to discoveries that will increase world organization, interconnectivity, and peace promotion. Afghanistan and surrounding regions are major focal points for current anti-terrorist activities of the USA and its allies, including Pakistan. The United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have shared many similar political objectives, as well as differences, in cold war and post-cold-war eras, reflected by variable provisions of material aid. It is well recognized that understanding Afghanistan requires comprehension of the Pakistan situation as well, especially for common resources. Water is paramount because it is absolutely vital, but can be contaminated by internal or cross-border terrorism. The Kabul and Indus rivers originate in the Hindu Kush - Himalaya ranges. The Kabul River flows from Afghanistan into Pakistan, and after irrigating Peshawar basin, joins the Indus. The Indus, after its origin in Tibet and flow through the Indian Himalaya, enters Pakistan and flows south as the irrigation lifeblood of the country. Any terroristic addition of radioactive nuclides or contaminants to either river could dramatically impact the dependent riverine ecologies. Monitoring cells thus need to be established at locations in Afghanistan and Pakistan to assess base-line river variances for possible future contamination by terrorists. This paper presents a general view and the physical and chemical parameters of parts of the two rivers, and of the surrounding underground water in Peshawar Basin, including pH, conductivity, total\n\nCoverage and factors associated with tetanus toxoid vaccination among married women of reproductive age: a cross sectional study in Peshawar.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaeem, Mohammad; Khan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Islam; Abbas, Syed Hussain; Adil, Muhammad; Khan, Ayasha; Naz, Syeda Maria; Khan, Muhammad Usman\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPakistan has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, with widely prevalent maternal and neonatal tetanus. The purpose of this study was to estimate the coverage and determine the factors associated with tetanus toxoid vaccination status among females of reproductive age in Peshawar. A Cross-sectional study was conducted in Peshawar, Pakistan, from 9 June to 19 June 2010. A total of 304 females of reproductive age (17 45) years were selected from both urban and rural areas of Peshawar through random sampling. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was administered to females. Questions about demographics, income, education of husband, occupation, accessibility to health centres and frequency of visits from health workers was inquired. Knowledge and views on immunization were also asked. Overall 55.6% were vaccinated. Urban population was 54.3% while rural population was 45.7%. Reasons for not vaccinating were: No awareness (38.4%), being busy (18.1%), centre too far (18.1%), misconceptions (10.86%), and fear of reactions (4.3%). Most of the females thought immunization was effective (89.5%). Husband education, females' knowledge and views on immunization, income, distance, frequency of health visits were the main factors associated with immunization status. Majority of females are not vaccinated. Effective media campaigns on maternal tetanus vaccination should be carried. Lady health workers should be mobilised effectively to increase the vaccination coverage.\n\nEffective Use of Action-Oriented Studies in Pakistan.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMiles, M.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis article summarizes results from action-oriented studies carried out at the Mental Heath Centre in Peshawar, Pakistan, dealing with such topics as attitudes toward disability, casual integration, and trends in polio paralysis.

We report descriptive statistics of self-reported sexual behaviour data from cross-sectional mapping and biological and behavioural surveys conducted among 1431 MSWs and 1415 HSWs in four cities across Pakistan in 2011. While Karachi had the largest numbers of MSWs and HSWs, Quetta had the largest relative population sizes, with 3.6 MSWs per 1000 male adults and 3.3 HSWs per 1000 male adults. There was considerable variability in the proportion of HSWs who operate through deras, ranging from 2.2% in Peshawar to 62.7% in Karachi. The number of HSWs per guru varies by city, from 1.5 in Quetta to 16.5 HSWs per guru in Karachi. Among HSWs, the use of mobile phones for solicitation ranged from 37.6% in Quetta to 83% in Peshawar and among MSWs the use of mobile phones ranged from 27% in Karachi to 52% in Quetta. In Quetta, a large proportion of HSWs (41%) find clients through gurus. Client volume tended to be higher among HSWs and among both MSWs and HSWs in Quetta and Peshawar. Condom use with clients was most consistent in Quetta, with 31% of MSWs and 41% of HSWs reporting always using condoms with clients. Peshawar had the greatest proportion reporting never using condoms. There is considerable geographic heterogeneity in the characteristics and operational dynamics of MSWs and HSWs across Pakistan.\n\nBalochistan basin of Pakistan deserves a second look\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nQuadri, V.N.; Quadri, S.M.G.J.\n\n1996-09-23\n\nThe event of UMC Pakistan, a unit of United Meridian Corp. of Houston, obtaining an exploration license covering 7,480 sq km in the Gwadar district off Makran in the Balochistan basin is good news. The extent of exploration surveys and drilling place this 300,000 sq km basin in the frontier category with confidence in the area speculative due to inadequate data, although hydrocarbon potential may be regarded as moderate to high by comparison with its analogs in other parts of the world. However, the presence along the Makran coast of spectacular volcanoes spewing gas charged water, if not anything else,moreÂ Â» justifies a second look, or rather a first for some parts, at the Balochistan basin.

The prevalence of polio in Pakistan is exceptional in global context. Quetta and Peshawar divisions are amongst the most affected regions hit by polio in Pakistan. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards polio immunization among residents of Quetta and Peshawar divisions in Pakistan. A descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 768 participants was conducted from August to December, 2014 in Quetta and Peshawar divisions in Pakistan. Multistage sampling technique was used to draw a sample of residents from each division. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data from eligible participants. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results. A total of 38.8 % participants exhibited good knowledge about polio. Mean knowledge score of the participants was 7.35âÂ±â2.54 (based on 15 knowledge questions). Older age (pâ<â0.001), low qualification (pâ<â0.05), rural locality (pâ<â0.05) and Quetta division (pâ<â0.001) were significantly associated with poor knowledge of polio. A large proportion of participants displayed negative attitudes towards polio immunization (84.8 %), with a mean score of 19.19âÂ±â2.39 (based on 8 attitude statements). Lack of education (pâ<â0.001) and rural residence (pâ<â0.001) were significantly associated with the negative attitudes of participants towards polio immunization. False religious beliefs (39.06 %), lack of knowledge (33.7 %), fear of infertility by polio vaccines (32.16 %) and security issues (29.42 %) were reported by the participants as the main barriers towards polio immunization. The findings of this study showed poor knowledge and negative attitudes of participants towards polio immunizations. Religious beliefs and lack of knowledge about polio immunization were reported as the major\n\nRat-bites of an epidemic proportion in Peshawar vale; a GIS based approach in risk assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nFatima, Syeda Hira; Zaidi, Farrah; Adnan, Muhammad; Ali, Asad; Jamal, Qaiser; Khisroon, Muhammad\n\n2018-03-19\n\nContemporary studies demonstrate that rodent bites do not occur frequently. However, a huge number of cases were reported from Peshawar vale, Pakistan during 2016. Two species, the local black rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the invasive brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769) might be the suspected cause. Several studies indicated the invasion of brown rats into Pakistan presumably via port city of Karachi. In this study, we modeled geospatial distribution of rodent bites for risk assessment in the region. Bite cases reported to tertiary care lady reading hospital were monitored from January 1 to August 31, 2016. Among 1747 cases, statistically informative data (nâ=â1295) was used for analyses. MaxEnt algorithm was employed for geospatial modeling, taking into account various environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and elevation) and anthropogenic factors (human population density, distance from roads, distance from water channels, and land use/land cover). MaxEnt results revealed that urban slums (84.5%) are at highest risk followed by croplands (10.9%) and shrublands (2.7%). Anthropogenic factors affecting incidence of rodent bites included host density (contribution: 34.7), distance from water channels (3.2), land use/land cover (2.8), and distance from roads (2). Most of the cases occurred within a radius of 0.3Â km from roads and 5Â km from water channels. Rodent bite incidence is currently at its peak in Peshawar vale. Factors significantly affecting rodents' bite activity and their distribution and dispersal include urbanization, distance from roads, and water channels. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of invasion by brown rat on bite incidence.\n\nComplicated jejunal diverticula as surgical emergency: experience at a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmed, Ijaz; Naeem, Mohammad; Samad, Ambreen; Nasir, Amir; Aman, Zahid; Ahmed, Siddique; Manan, Fazal\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDiverticula of small intestine are rare. Jejunal diverticula can be single or multiple. Diverticula in the jejunum tend to be large and multiple. Clinically they may be asymptomatic or may give rise to symptoms like pain, flatulence and borborygmi, may produce malabsorption syndrome or may present in emergency with different acute pathologies like perforation, haemorrhage, obstruction, enterolith formation and inflammation. The Objective was to see the pattern of complications in jejunal diverticula presenting as a surgical emergency. This descriptive study was conducted at Surgical Units of the 3 tertiary care Hospitals of Peshawar, for 7 years from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2008. Study included all patients presenting to and admitted in Surgical Unit, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar with complicated jejunal diverticula during the above mentioned period. Name, age, sex, other relevant data, history and examination findings and results of investigation were recorded. Uncomplicated jejuna diverticula were excluded from study. The operative findings and the type of complication were recorded. Ten patients were admitted during 7 years of study. Out of all patients 9 were male and 1 was female. Eight out of 10 patients presented with perforation of diverticula while 1 patient had severe inflammation of diverticulum causing pain, ileus and acute abdomen. One patient had acute pain due to adhesion formation. It is seen that complicated jejunal diverticulae are quite rare and the most common complication is perforation. Inflammation and adhesion are other complications with which jejunal diverticula presented during this study.\n\nFrom Camels to Computers: The Realities of Increasing the Flow of Agricultural Information in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAttaullah; Johnson, Jane S.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nOutlines the various steps involved in the process of modernizing the information storage and retrieval systems within the library of the Northwest Frontier Province Agricultural University (NWFP AU) in Peshawar, Pakistan.

M.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWater contaminated with pathogenic bacteria causing diarrhoea poses a health risk to the population. Worldwide, diarrhoea is the 3rd leading cause of death. A changing climate may increase the concentration of pathogens in surface water. Increased temperature will mostly increase the inactivation of pathogens and therefore decrease the surface water concentration. Increased precipitation may dilute contaminated water, but may also increase the runoff of pathogens into the surface water. Decreased precipitation may have the opposite effect. Moreover, increased chance of extreme precipitation events and increased risk of floods may also increase the runoff of pathogens into the surface water. The net balance of these effects is uncertain. The objective of our study is to quantify the relationship between hydroclimatic variables (surface air and water temperature, precipitation and runoff) and faecal indicator bacteria (FIB, E. coli and Enterococci) in two rivers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In these countries health problems are large, particularly in annual periods of flood. We studied FIB instead of pathogens, because of the costs associated with pathogen measurements. The relationship between FIB and hydroclimatic variables is expected to be comparable to the relationship between pathogens and hydroclimatic variables. For both regions the FIB concentrations have been monitored for two years between 2013 and 2015 at several points in the rivers. Concentrations of FIB in Kabul (Pakistan) and Betna (Bangladesh) river basins are very high (up to 5.2 log10 cfu/100ml). Due to a broken waste water treatment system of the city of Peshawar, concentrations are higher in Kabul than in the Betna river. All hydroclimatic variables positively correlate with FIB. An unexpected positive relation with temperature can be explained by the fact that temperature and discharge increase at the same time and possibly FIB growth. The positive relation with precipitation and discharge shows\n\nPhysicochemical characteristics of various milk samples available in Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nImran, Mohammad; Khan, Hamayun; Hassan, Syed Shah; Khan, Rasool\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe report physicochemical characteristics of various kinds of liquid milk commercially available in Pakistan in comparison with those of fresh natural milk from animals. Milk samples were collected from local markets at Peshawar, Pakistan, and analyzed for their physical features, including moisture, total solids, specific gravity, conductivity, viscosity and titratable acidity (lactic acid equivalent), and chemical components and macro-minerals, including total protein, casein, lactose, ash and minerals (Na, K and Mg). These items were compared with the physicochemical characteristics of the fresh natural milk samples from buffalo, cow and goat. The results were also compared with reported nutritional quality of milk from various countries and World Health Organization (WHO) standards. We found that all the physical features and chemical components of commercially available milk in Pakistan markets meet WHOâs requirements, except for Na, K, Ca and Mg, which are below the standards.

The present study was aimed to determine seroprevalence of T. equi in donkeys, horses, and mules from two equine populated districts (Peshawar and Charsadda) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. Methods: A total of 393 equine (195 horses, 194 donkeys and 4 mules) serum samples were collected from five and four randomly selected localities in Charsadda (n = 193) and Peshawar (n = 200), respectively. The presence of antibodies to T. equi was determined using a commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: An overall seroprevalence of 38.2% (n=150) was observed among all the tested animals suggesting a higher seropositivity among equids belonging to Charsada (50.3%) as compared to Peshawar (27.5%). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that being a donkey (OR 2.94), having tick infestation (OR 4.32), history of voiding red (i.e., blood containing) urine (OR 3.97) and anemia (OR 2.1) were the factors significantly associated with the seroprevalence of T. equi. For animals with higher anti-T. equi antibody titers, a strong association of seroprevalence for T. equi was recorded with species, age, sex, tick infestation, anemia and history of hematuria. Conclusion: The present study indicates a high level of exposure of working equids to T. equi in KPK region, Pakistan. Future studies should focus on tick vector identification and other factors responsible for spread of the disease.

The presence of biofilm producing bacteria in these wounds is considered as an important virulence factor that leads to chronic implications including ulceration. The undertaken study aimed to isolate and identify the biofilm aerobic bacterial pathogens from patients with chronic wound infections, and determine their antibiotics resistance profiles Method: During this study, swab specimens were collected from patients with chronic wounds at teaching hospitals of Peshawar, Pakistan between May 2013 and June 2014. The isolated aerobic bacterial pathogens were identified on the basis of standard cultural characteristics and biochemical tests. Antibiotics resistance profiles of biofilm producing bacteria against selected antibiotics were then determined. Among the chronic wound infections, diabetic foot ulcers were most common 37 (37%), followed by surgical ulcers 27 (27%). Chronic wounds were common in male patients older than 40 years. Among the total 163 isolated bacterial pathogens the most prevalent bacterial species were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 44 (27%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 26 (16%), Staphylococcus species 22 (14%) and Streptococcus spp. 21 (13%). The isolation rate of bacterial pathogens was high among patients with diabetic foot ulcers 83 (50.9%). Among bacterial isolates, 108 (66.2%) were observed as biofilm producers while 55 (33.8%) did not form biofilm in our model. The investigated biofilm producing bacterial isolates showed comparatively high resistance against tested antibiotics compared to non-biofilm producing bacterial isolates. The most effective antibiotics were amikacine and cefepime against all isolates. Increased multidrug resistance in biofilm producing bacteria associated with chronic wounds was observed in this study. Judicious use of antibiotics is needed to control the wound\n\nHeavy metal pollution assessment in various industries of Pakistan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRehman, Wajid; Zeb, Akif; Noor, Nayyara; Nawaz, Mohsan\n\n2008-07-01\n\nWater pollution is a source of danger to the health of people living in developing countries such as Pakistan. The main industries located at various industrial zones of Pakistan cause water pollution, which ultimately result in various diseases. The aim of the present study was to study the concentrations of essential and toxic metals (Na, K, Cu, Zn, Fe, Ca, Pb and As) in the drained water of three main industrial estates of Pakistan, i.e., Industrial Estate No. 1 Peshawar, Small Industrial Estate No. 2 Gujranwala, Industrial Estate Hattar Haripur, and in Warsak Canal (industrially pure water) with the help of atomic absorption spectroscopy and flame emission spectroscopy. The study showed high Pb and As levels originating from industries. The concentrations of Pb and As ranged from 0.04 to 0.942 mg/L in all the samples. These have been extensively used for irrigation since the last five decades. The elevated concentrations of heavy metals are continuously entering into the food chain through agriculture leading to serious health hazards and a threat to the sustainability of local ecosystem.\n\nCutaneous Leishmaniasis in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan: Clinical Diversity and Species-Level Diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhan, Nazma Habib; Bari, Arfan ul; Hashim, Rizwan; Khan, Inamullah; Muneer, Akhtar; Shah, Akram; Wahid, Sobia; Yardley, Vanessa; O'Neil, Brighid; Sutherland, Colin J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study primarily aimed to identify the causative species of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan and to distinguish any species-specific variation in clinical manifestation of CL. Diagnostic performance of different techniques for identifying CL was assessed. Isolates of Leishmania spp. were detected by in vitro culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from dried filter papers and microscopic examination of direct lesion smears from patients visiting three major primary care hospitals in Peshawar. A total of 125 CL patients were evaluated. Many acquired the disease from Peshawar and the neighboring tribal area of Khyber Agency. Military personnel acquired CL while deployed in north and south Waziristan. Leishmania tropica was identified as the predominant infecting organism in this study (89.2%) followed by Leishmania major (6.8%) and, unexpectedly, Leishmania infantum (4.1%). These were the first reported cases of CL caused by L. infantum in Pakistan. PCR diagnosis targeting kinetoplast DNA was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying 86.5% of all samples found positive by any other method. Other methods were as follows: ribosomal DNA PCR (78.4%), internal transcribed spacer 2 region PCR (70.3%), culture (67.1%), and microscopy (60.5%). Clinical examination reported 14 atypical forms of CL. Atypical lesions were not significantly associated with the infecting Leishmania species, nor with âdryâ or âwetâ appearance of lesions. Findings from this study provide a platform for species typing of CL patients in Pakistan, utilizing a combination of in vitro culture and molecular diagnostics. Moreover, the clinical diversity described herein can benefit clinicians in devising differential diagnosis of the disease.

Samples of effluents, mud, and water were collected from the target area (industrial area of Peshawar), the area of water supply source, and from the less polluted area, the Lower Dir district, as the control. Hg was determined by the cold vapor generation technique, while arsenic was determined using the electrothermal atomic absorption technique. Data of the water from the industrial area were compared with that of the source area, control area, as well as with the WHO and some international drinking water quality standards. The results show that some parameters, i.e., TDS, DO, pH, and hardness, were more than the permissible limits. Textile and glass industries were found to be the major sources of Hg and As pollution. Downstream dilution of these contaminants was also observed.\n\nPrevalence of zinc deficiency among rural women during childbearing age in Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkhtar, Tasleem; Khan, Mir Hassan; Zahoorullah; Hussain, Hamid; Nazli, Rubina; Lutfullah, Ghosia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nZinc deficiency is a commonly reported health problem throughout the world. This cross sectional survey was conducted in rural Peshawar with an aim to estimate the prevalence of zinc deficiency in women of child bearing age and find its association with age, marital, pregnancy status and parity. Data was collected from 353 women age 15-45 years. EPI INFO version 6.04 was used for data analysis. Overall 98 (27.8 %) women were zinc deficient (<80 Î¼g/dL) while 31 (8.8%) had severe zinc deficiency (<50Î¼g/dL.). Mean zinc level was found to increase gradually with the increase in the age up to 40 years and then starts decreasing significantly beyond this age. A significant decrease (p<0.03) in zinc concentration was found in married as compared to unmarried women. Out of 31 female with severe zinc deficiency, 23 (74.2%) were pregnant. Pregnant women in second (OR (CI) 3.36 (1.52-7.44) p<0.0008) and third ((OR (CI) 3.73 (1.91-7.30) p<0.00002) trimester were 3.4 & 3.7 times, respectively more zinc deficient as compared to control women. Mean zinc levels were significantly lower in women having no children versus women with 1-5 numbers of children. This study concludes that severe zinc deficiency especially prevalent in pregnant women needs urgent correction through food supplementation.\n\nRegression in polio eradication in Pakistan: A national tragedy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanwal, Sumaira; Hussain, Abrar; Mannan, Shazia; Perveen, Shazia\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPolio is one out of 200 infections results to lasting paralysis, usually in the legs. The year 2014 has been the saddest year for the Pakistan when the World was about to eliminate Polio from all over the World. In year 1994 Pakistan took the initiative to eliminate Polio from the country. The efforts were going well until 2005, when Pakistan was on the wedge to overcome the Disease. The hopes were high that soon Pakistan will become a polio-virus-free country, but the drone strikes in FATA and the rise of different militant groups as a reaction of the drone attacks in FATA made it difficult for the health workers to continue their vaccination campaigns in these areas. However various factors ruined the efforts made to eradicate Polio. In Pakistan, polio is widespread to three sections. These are Karachi, Quetta block (Quetta, Pishin and Killah Abdullah district) and FATA and Peshawar district. Numerous things are accountable for polio flourishing in these regions. These comprise near to the ground socioeconomic rank of the families, not having the knowledge concerning hazard caused by polio and disinformation by limited significant people concerning how polio vaccines fabricate damage. In 2014, only 3 countries in the world remain polio-endemic: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. From year 2012-2014 the number of registered Polio cases is on rise contrary to rest of the other two Polio-endemic countries. In spite of the extensive work done by Polio workers the number of Polio cases has broken the 16 year record. The situation is getting worse because it can also be threatening to the rest of the World.\n\nAnatomy of success in oil and gas exploration in Pakistan, 1915--94\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nQuadri, V.N.; Quadri, S.M.G.J.\n\n1996-05-13\n\nPakistan, flanked by Iran, Afghanistan, China, and India, is the size of Texas and Louisiana combined. The Indus and Baluchistan basins cover 80% of Pakistan`s total area. The country also has 230,000 sq km of marine Exclusive Economic Zone. The law regarding E and P activity was promulgated in 1986, replacing the previous Petroleum (Production) Rules of 1949. As a result of the new Petroleum Policy implemented in March 1994 and streamlining of the bid review and award process, acreage leased including reconnaissance during 1994 was 355,541 sq km onshore and 120,640 sq km offshore, with the number of operatingmoreÂ Â» groups also a record high of 46. Although complex and disturbed as a result of collision tectonics, Pakistan`s geology is as fascinating as the surface geomorphology, from the complex compressional thrusted to the relatively simple extensional rifted, salt related to transform fault associated, the reefs, too, all impressive traps for petroleum, at times almost textbook examples. However, domestic oil production at yearend 1994 was about 53,251 b/d of oil and 1.7 bcfd of gas. Oil and gas have been found in the Potwar/Upper Indus basin and Lower Indus basin, and mainly gas with one gas/condensate discovery in the Sulaiman/Middle Indus basin. This article attempts to present brief case history outlines of typical, significant oil and gas discoveries of Pakistan 1915--94 with respect to the two main productive basins, their source and reservoir sequences, in order to determine the anatomy of success in exploration in Pakistan.Â«Â less\n\nPakistan-U.S. Relations\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-02-06\n\nPeshawar.

Cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, from August 2015 - January 2016; sampling technique was random/probability/non-purposive. Self-designed questionnaire was utilized; carrying questions pertinent to desire for sons/daughters during marital life, and demographic details. Data analyzed via descriptive analysis (SPSS-21), expressed as frequencies/percentages and mean Â± standard deviation(minimum/maximum). Sons and daughters desired (dependent variables) were cross-tabulated with independent variables. Response rate was 63.25% (n-506). Data revealed following: Sons desired 3.05Â±2.061(1/12); Daughters desired 1.15Â±0.767(0/4); 6.1%(n-31) and 0.6%(n-3) desired infinite number of sons and daughters respectively, 18.2%(n-92) did not desire to have even one daughter, while 2.2%(n-11) considered it immaterial to have daughters or sons. There was a significant relation between sons desired and client's education (p<0.001), husband's education (p<0.001) and socioeconomic class (p<0.001). There was no significant impact of religion (p-0.142) on desire for sons. Impact of independent variables on daughters desired was similar but less pronounced. There was candid son preference among the respondents. Gender discrimination can be attenuated by adequately addressing son preference at all tiers.\n\nA Cross-Sectional Survey of Healthcare Workers on the Knowledge and Attitudes towards Polio Vaccination in Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhan, Muhammad Umair; Ahmad, Akram; Aqeel, Talieha; Akbar, Naila; Salman, Saad; Idress, Jawaria\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Pakistan accounts for 85.2% of the total polio cases reported worldwide. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an integral part of immunization campaigns and source of education for the general public. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards polio vaccination among HCWs providing immunisation and education to general public in Quetta and Peshawar divisions of Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 490 HCWs was conducted in two major referral public teaching hospitals of Quetta and Peshawar divisions. During February to April, 2015, a random sample of 490 HCWs was invited to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitudes were assessed by using self-administered, anonymous and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results. Results A total of 468 participants responded to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 95.5%. Overall, participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitudes towards polio vaccination. The mean knowledge score of HCWs about polio was 13.42Â±2.39 (based on 18 knowledge questions) while the mean attitude score was 28.75Â±5.5 (based on 9 attitudes statements). Knowledge gaps were identified about the incubation period of poliovirus (19.5%), management issues (31.9%), use of polio vaccine in mild illnesses (34.7%) and the consequences of the polio virus (36.9%). The majority of participants agreed that all children should be vaccinated for polio (95.1%), while reservations were noted about the need of a booster (38.9%), and sterility issues associated with polio vaccines (43.6%). Internet (n = 167, 37%) and Posters (n = 158, 35%) were the main sources used by HCWs to educate themselves about polio. Conclusion Participants in this study had good knowledge and positive attitudes towards polio vaccination. Although the data are indicative of gaps in the knowledge of HCWs, the findings may not be generalized to other hospitals in Pakistan.

Ureteric calculi are common occurrence and a major burden on health care facilities in Pakistan. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of pneumatic lithoclast in the management of ureteric calculi. Case series study Department of Urology at Institute of Kidney Diseases Hayatabad Peshawar, from 1st Oct 2010 to 1st Oct 2011. One-hundred adult patients with ureteric calculi â¥ 0.7 cm were evaluated by history, physical examination, routine blood and urine examination after taking their written informed consent and approval of ethical committee. Ultrasound and X-ray KUB were done with IVU if required. All patients underwent ureteroscopy within intracorporeal lithotripsy and JJ stenting. Patients were followed up with post-op X-ray KUB at 24 hours and then weekly intervals till they became stone free. Following parameters were assessed: stone size, site, laterality, degree of fragmentation, success rate, stone migration and complications. Inability to reach the calculus with URS, proximal migration of stone or requirement of another/auxiliary procedure was considered failure. One hundred and ten patients were enrolled with a mean age of 38Â±10 years. There were 72 males and 28 females. Fifty-eight calculi were on right and 42 on left side. 24, 24 and 52 stones were in upper, middle and lower ureter respectively. Forty stones measured 7-10 mm, 52 measured 11-15 mm and 8 measured 16-20 mm in size. 98 stones were broken while 2 calculi migrated proximally. Overall success rate was 90% (Efficiency Quotient =78.95). Success rate in upper, middle and lower ureter was 83.3%, 83.3% and 96.1% respectively. 10 and 2 patients required ESWL and open ureterolithotomy, respectively, as additional treatment. Mean operative time was 33.5 minutes. There were no major complications.. Pneumatic lithoclast with URS is effective and safe in the management of the ureteric calculi with some limitations in the upper ureter.\n\nFREQUENCY OF ABDOMINAL OBESITY AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH DIABETES MELLITUS AMONG PEOPLE OF PESHAWAR.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Attaullah; Faheem, Muhammad; Shah, Syed Tahir; Hadi, Abdul; Rafiullah; Ahmad, Salman; Gul, Adnan Mahmood; Shah, Sayyad Farhat Abbas; Jan, Hikmatullah; Hafizullah, Mohammad\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIncreased body weight is a major risk factor for the metabolic syndrome which is a cluster of coronary heart disease risk factors, like: hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. This study was conducted to determine the frequency of abdominal obesity and diabetes mellitus in the population of Peshawar and association between them. This was a cross sectional study, performed by the Cardiology Department, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, in the population of Peshawar. All participants were interviewed in detail regarding known risk factors for coronary artery disease. Waist circumference (â¥102 cm in male and â¥88 cm in females) was used as the surrogate marker for abdominal obesity in already diagnosed patients of type-2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 2548 individuals were included, 71.1% were male. Mean age was 37.94Â±12.59 years. Mean waist circumference was 90.25Â±13.45cm in males and 90.52Â±12.52cm in females. Diabetes was present in 4.4% of the participants and abdominal obesity in 56.6% Among the male, abdominal obesity was present in 39.4% and diabetes in 2.9%. Out of 39.4% males with abdominal obesity, 2% were diabetic. Out of 38.6% males with no abdominal obesity, 0.9% was diabetic. Amongst the total 559 (21.1%) female subjects, 17.2% were having abdominal obesity and 1.4% was diabetics. Among 123 (4.8%) females with no abdominal obesity, 0.1% was diabetic. A positive association was established between abdominal obesity and diabetes mellitus with a significant p-valve (<0.05). Abdominal obesity is more common in the local population of Peshawar and associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe effect of substrate, season, and agroecological zone on mycoflora and aflatoxin contamination of poultry feed from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlam, Sahib; Shah, Hamid Ullah; Khan, Habibullah; Magan, Naresh\n\n2012-10-01\n\nTo study the effects of and interactions among feed types, seasons, and agroecological zones on the total fungal viable count and aflatoxins B1 (AFB1), B2 (AFB2), G1 (AFG1), and G2 (AFG2) production in poultry feed, an experiment was conducted using three-factorial design. A total of 216 samples of poultry feed ingredients, viz. maize, wheat, rice, cotton seed meal (CSM), and finished products, that is, starter and finisher broilers' rations, were collected from Peshawar, Swat, and D. I. Khan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, during the winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons of the year 2007/2008. Analysis of variance showed that there was a complex interaction among all these factors and that this influenced the total fungal viable count and relative concentrations of the aflatoxins produced. Minimum total culturable fungi (6.43 Ã 10Â³ CFUs/g) were counted in CSM from D. I. Khan region in winter season while maximum (26.68 Ã 10Â³ CFUs/g) in starter ration from Peshawar region in summer. Maximum concentrations of AFB1 (191.65 ng/g), AFB2 (86.85 ng/g), and AFG2 (89.90 ng/g) were examined during the summer season whereas the concentration of AFG1 was maximum (167.82 ng/g) in autumn in finisher ration from Peshawar region. Minimum aflatoxins were produced in the winter season across all the three agroecological zones.\n\nIndus basin off Pakistan contains few wells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nQuadri, V.N.; Quadri, S.M.G.J.\n\n1997-06-16\n\nThe U.N.

However, limited data exist on the frequency of poisons implicated in homicidal, suicidal, and accidental cases in North-West Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). This retrospective study of 353 cases and biological specimens of poisoning received at the department of Forensic medicine and toxicology, Khyber Medical College Peshawar from 13 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Frequency of poisoning was assessed by testing each specimen for 17 different poisons. Of all the specimens, 250 (70.8%) specimens tested positive and the rest didn't show any indication of poisoning (n=103, 29.2%). The most frequent poisons detected were benzodiazepines (total n=75), organophosphates (total n=58), phencyclidine (total n=30) and morphine (total n=23). Gender had a significant association with benzodiazepines (p=0.011), tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.001), and organophosphates (p<0.001). Organophosphates were the most common cause of poisoning in females while benzodiazepines were the most common cause of poisoning in males. Poisoning by benzodiazepines, organophosphates and phencyclidine are the most common causes of intoxication in population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Source of poisoning varies with gender for organophosphates, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nMuslim Scholars' Knowledge, Attitudes and Perceived Barriers Towards Polio Immunization in Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Muhammad Umair; Ahmad, Akram; Salman, Saad; Ayub, Maria; Aqeel, Talieha; Haq, Noman-Ul; Saleem, Fahad; Khan, Muhammad Ubaid\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPakistan is one of the two countries where polio remains endemic. Among multiple reasons of polio prevalence, false religious beliefs are accounted as major barriers towards polio immunization in Pakistan. Within this context, religious scholars are now engaged in polio immunization campaigns to dismantle the myths and battle the resurgence of polio in Pakistan. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and perceived barriers of Muslim scholars towards polio immunization in Pakistan. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey of Muslim scholars was conducted in Quetta and Peshawar divisions of Pakistan. From October to December 2015, a convenience sample of 770 Muslim scholars was recruited from the local mosques and religious institutions to participate in this study. Knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers were assessed by using self-administered, anonymous and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to express the results with pÂ <Â 0.05 taken as significant. Three hundred and forty-eight (45.2Â %) participants exhibited good knowledge about polio with a mean score of 7.16Â Â±Â 2.12 (based on 14 questions). Knowledge gaps were identified about the transmission (32.6Â %) and consequences of poliovirus (39.9Â %). Overall, 527 (68.4Â %) participants showed positive attitudes towards polio immunization with a mean attitude score of 27.35Â Â±Â 2.68 (based on nine statements). The majority of participants agreed on the need of depoliticizing polio immunization issues (87.1Â %), while reservations were noted about their willingness to participate in future polio immunization programs (44.6Â %). Security (75.8Â %) and vaccine management issues (64Â %) were reported by the participants as the major barriers towards polio immunization in Pakistan. The findings showed poor knowledge of Muslim scholars towards polio; however, their attitudes were positive towards polio immunization.

The first exploration well in the region was drilled near Kundal in 1866, just seven years after the Drake well in Pennsylvania. To date, 384 exploration wells have been drilled in Pakistan resulting in 45 oil and 55 gas discoveries, thus generating a highly favourable success ratio of 1:4. The drilling density in Pakistan is one well/1000 square kilometers. Pakistan has proven oil reserves of around 500 million barrels of oil, whereas proven gasmoreÂ Â» reserves are about 31 trillion cubic feet. However, Pakistan`s resource potential is estimated to be 40 billion barrels of oil and 200 TCF of gas. The purpose of this paper is to describe: (i) habitat and production of crude oil in Pakistan, (ii) Pakistan`s current energy needs and future outlook, and (iii) steps being taken by the Government of Pakistan to promote exploration for oil and gas.Â«Â less\n\nAssessment of tap water quality and corrosion scales from the selected distribution systems in northern Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaig, Shams Ali; Lou, Zimo; Baig, Muzaffar Ali; Qasim, Muhammad; Shams, Dilawar Farhan; Mahmood, Qaisar; Xu, Xinhua\n\n2017-04-01\n\nCorrosion deposits formed within drinking water distribution systems deteriorate drinking water quality and resultantly cause public health consequences. In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the concurrent conditions of corrosion scales and the drinking water quality in selected water supply schemes (WSS) in districts Chitral, Peshawar, and Abbottabad, northern Pakistan. Characterization analyses of the corrosion by-products revealed the presence of Î±-FeOOH, Î³-FeOOH, Fe 3 O 4 , and SiO 2 as major constituents with different proportions. The constituents of all the representative XRD peaks of Peshawar WSS were found insignificant as compared to other WSS, and the reason could be the variation of source water quality. Well-crystallized particles in SEM images indicated the formation of dense oxide layer on corrosion by-products. A wider asymmetric vibration peak of SiO 2 appeared only in Chitral and Abbottabad WSS, which demonstrated higher siltation in the water source. One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant variations in pH, turbidity, TDS, K, Mg, PO 4 , Cl, and SO 4 values, which revealed that these parameters differently contributed to the source water quality. Findings from this study suggested the implementation of proper corrosion prevention measures and the establishment of international collaboration for best corrosion practices, expertise, and developing standards.\n\nPrevalence of HBV and HBV vaccination coverage in health care workers of tertiary hospitals of Peshawar, Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) may progress to serious consequences and increase dramatically beyond endemic dimensions that transmits to or from health care workers (HCWs) during routine investigation in their work places. Basic aim of this study was to canvass the safety of HCWs and determine the prevalence of HBV and its possible association with occupational and non-occupational risk factors. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage level and main barriers to vaccination were also taken in account. Results A total of 824 health care workers were randomly selected from three major hospitals of Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Blood samples were analyzed in Department of Zoology, Kohat University of Science and Technology Kohat, and relevant information was obtained by means of preset questionnaire. HCWs in the studied hospitals showed 2.18% prevalence of positive HBV. Nurses and technicians were more prone to occupational exposure and to HBV infection. There was significant difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCWs as well as between the doctors and all other categories. Barriers to complete vaccination, in spite of good knowledge of subjects in this regard were work pressure (39.8%), negligence (38.8%) un-affordability (20.9%), and unavailability (0.5%). Conclusions Special preventive measures (universal precaution and vaccination), which are fundamental way to protect HCW against HBV infection should be adopted.

The Indus has undergone profound transformations, from large-scale canal irrigation in the mid-nineteenth century to partition and development of the international river basin in the mid-twentieth century, systems modeling in the late-twentieth century, and new technologies for discharge measurement and data analytics in the early twenty-first century. We address these processes through a socio-hydrologic framework that couples historical geographic and analytical methods at three levels of flow in the Punjab. The first level assesses Indus River inflows analysis from its origins in 1922 to the present. The second level shows how river inflows translate into 10-daily canal command deliveries that vary widely in their conformity with canal entitlements. The third level of analysis shows how new flow measurement technologies raise questions about the performance of established methods of water scheduling (warabandi) on local distributaries. We show how near real-time measurement sheds light on the efficiency and transparency of surface water management. These local socio-hydrologic changes have implications in turn for the larger scales of canal and river inflow management in complex river basins.\n\nKnowledge, Attitude And Practice Of Common Cold And Its Management Among Doctors Of Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nRehman, Muneeb-Ur-; Tariq, Naseer Alam; Ahmed, Mamoon; Ahmad, Maryam; Zahid, Areej; Chaudhry, Quratulain; Tahir, Bisma; Islam, Zoraiz Ul; Ud Din, Zahoor Mohi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAntibiotic misuse for upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold is widespread in clinical practice. Excessive prescription of antibiotics by doctors has resulted in increased antimicrobial resistance. This led to our objective of determining the percentage of doctors in Pakistan prescribing antibiotics for the treatment of common cold and to know about their knowledge in preventing the spread of this disease. It was a cross-sectional descriptive study, conducted in 9 cities of Pakistan including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Multan and D.G. Khan over a period of 03 months -from October to December, 2013. Questionnaire regarding the disease spread and its treatment was distributed among 300 randomly selected doctors in nine cities of Pakistan from both public and private sector. Eighteen percent of the doctors prescribe antibiotics for common cold. Only 113 (37.7%) doctors correctly responded that mean incubation period for common cold was 1-2 days. Two hundred and nine (69.7%) answered correctly that cold weather increases susceptibility to common cold. Only 84 (28%) responded correctly by choosing that regular and frequent hand-washing with good quality soaps was the most effective way to prevent spread of this disease in day-to-day life. Antibiotics are being prescribed for treatment of common cold by a large proportion of doctors. There is insufficient knowledge among our doctors regarding the factors which aggravate or alleviate common cold symptoms as well as the methods by which these infections can be prevented.\n\nPakistan: Key Current Issues and Developments\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-06-01\n\nunites many disparate groups in heightened anti-American sentiment.47 â¢ Also in February, three U.S. soldiers were killed when a suicide car bomber...of 2009, or an average of about one every three days.

Apart from insecurity and inaccessibility challenges, the substantial shift of unimmunized children from North Waziristan due to recent military operations was presumed to favor the widespread poliovirus infection in Pakistan. To better understand the current epidemiological situation, we analyzed the virologic data of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) strains detected in Pakistan during 2013-2015. Five genetic clusters (A-E) were identified with at least 5% nucleotide divergence in the viral protein 1 (VP1) coding region. Peshawar, Quetta, and Karachi were found to be the major endemic foci where multiple discrete genetic lineages of WPV1 were detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that wild poliovirus strains from endemic regions were genetically distant (with 5%-15% VP1 nucleotide divergence) from those detected in North Waziristan cases, excluding the possibility of a recent progenitor of WPV1 instigating single-source transmission across the country. Orphan lineages detected in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Jacobabad revealed silent transmission and the need for vigilant surveillance. Sustenance of analogous genetic lineages over a period of 3 years highlights multiple unimmunized foci present to maintain viral genetic diversity. Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that impoverished populations from North Waziristan serve as a possible determinant of widespread poliomyelitis infection in Pakistan and further emphasize the need to scale-up clinical and environmental surveillance as well as immunization activities.

Indigenous oil production meets only one-third of the requirement while the remaining is imported at a high cost. The pinch of soaring crude prices of the late 1970s accelerated the search for new petroleum resources. The last decade saw a notable increase in petroleum exploration as well as production of oil and gas. Pakistan lies along part of the Tertiary convergence zone and straddles the boundaries between Indian, Arabian, and Eurasian plates. It has a large sedimentary area and a proven petroleum potential. The basin evolution along themoreÂ Â» fringe of proto-Indian Ocean and subsequent modifications by continental collision can be correlated with the plate tectonic history. Better understanding of the geological history and the petroleum geodynamics have contributed in the finding of new resources. At the advent of the last decade, application of conceptual geological modeling opened up a new petroleum province in the south. Application of the state-of-the-art technique has made it possible to identify attractive prospects in the geologically complex imbricate zone in the northern province. The vast Indus basin also has the possibilities associated with stratigraphic, reefal, and other subtle trapping mechanisms. Finally, the Baluchistan basin and the continental shelf have only been marginally explored. The prospects for the future seem extremely bright, particularly the unproven Indus delta and the Baluchistan basin, which may drastically change this situation.Â«Â less\n\nUnlicensed and off-label use of drugs in pediatric surgical units at tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAamir, Muhammad; Khan, Jamshaid Ali; Shakeel, Faisal; Asim, Syed Muhammad\n\n2017-08-01\n\nBackground Unlicensed and off-label prescribing practice is global dilemma around the world. This pioneering study was designed to determine unlicensed and off-label use of drug in surgical wards of tertiary care hospitals of Pakistan. Objective To assess unlicensed and off-label use of drugs in pediatric surgical unit at three tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan. Setting Two government and one private tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. Method Drug profiles of 895 patients from three different clinical settings were evaluated for unlicensed and off-label use of drugs using Micromedex DRUGDEX. Main outcome measure Characteristics of the unlicensed and off-label drug prescriptions. Result Total of 3168 prescribed drugs were analyzed in this study. Indication (38.7%) and dose (34.8%) were the most frequent off-label categories. In comparison with the corresponding reference categories, infants and children, male patients and having less than five prescribed drugs were significant predictors of unlicensed prescriptions. In comparison with the corresponding reference categories, significant predictors of off-label drug prescribing were children younger than two year, children between 2-12Â years, patient staying at hospital less than 5Â days and patients having less than five prescribed drugs. Conclusion The prevalence of unlicensed and off-label drug prescriptions are high at pediatric surgical ward of tertiary care hospitals. More awareness of the efficacy and safety of drugs are required in pediatrics. In addition, new formulations with advanced dosing for children are also required to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.\n\nBomb blast injuries: an exploration of patient characteristics and outcome using Pakistan National Emergency Departments Surveillance (Pak-NEDS) data\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Bomb blast injuries result in premature deaths and burdening of healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to explore the characteristics and outcome of patients presenting to the emergency departments in Pakistan with bomb blast injuries. Methods Active surveillance was conducted in seven major emergency departments of Pakistan from November 2010-March 2011. All the sites are tertiary care urban centers. All the patients who presented to the hospital's emergency department (ED) following a bomb blast injury as per self-report or the ambulance personnel were included in the study. Frequency of demographics, injury pattern, and outcomes were calculated. Results A total of 103 patients with bomb blast injuries presented to the selected emergency departments. The median age of patients was 30 years. Around three-fourth of the patients were males (n = 74, 74.7%). Most of the bomb blast patients were seen in Peshawar (n = 41, 39.8%) and Karachi city (n = 31, 30.1%) and the most common mode of arrival was non-ambulance transport (n = 71, 76.3%). Upper limb injuries (n = 12, 40%) were common in the under 18 age group and lower limb injuries (n = 31, 39.2%) in the 18 years and above group. There were a total of 8 (7.7%) deaths reported out of these 103 patients. Conclusion Bomb blast injuries in Pakistan generally affect young males. Non-ambulance transport is the most common way to access emergency departments (ED). Overall ED mortality is high and capturing data during a disaster in an emergency department is challenging.

Despite much active research, the fundamental questions still remain elusive regarding when and where the Indian plate collided with the Asian plate. Especially in the west Himalaya, the questions become more complex due to disputes on the amalgamation history of interoceanic Kohistan-Ladakh arcs (KLA) with Karakoram of the Asian plate and the Indian plate. Here, we present a result of multiple-isotopic geochemistry and geochronology study in the Katawaz Basin in NW Pakistan, a remnant oceanic basin on the western Indian plate which was the repository for the sediments eroded from the west Himalaya ( Qayyum et al., 1996, 1997a, 1997b, 2001; Carter et al., 2010), to evaluate the time and character of collision in this region. In this study, we analyzed 22 bulk mudstone samples for Sr-Nd isotopes and 11 medium-grained sandstones for detrital zircon (U-Pb) geochronology and Hf isotopes. We constructed the Cenozoic chronology in the Katawaz Basin based on our newly collected detrital zircon U-Pb ages and fission track ages. We present the first record of Katawaz chronology that constrained the Khojak Formation to be < 40 Ma to < 22 Ma. The result is consistent with the previous nanofossil study that constrained the upper part of underlying Nisai Formation to be the Middle to Late Eocene. Our current study revealed that the Katawaz sedimentary sequence ranges in age from Eocene to the earliest Miocene. The samples from the Nisai Formation show the 87Sr/86Sr - ÉNd values overlapping those of the end member of the Karakoram of Asian origin, revealing the arrival of Asian detritus on the Indian plate prior to 50 Ma. There are two parallel lines of evidence supporting this conclusion: (1) young zircon grains (< 120 Ma), characterizing the KLA and Karakoram, persistently exist throughout the whole sedimentary\n\nAdherence to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for chronic heart failure - A national survey of the cardiologists in Pakistan\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground The aims of this study were to evaluate the awareness of and attitudes towards the 2005 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for Heart Failure (HF) of the cardiologists in Pakistan and assess barriers to adherence to guidelines. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in person from March to July 2009 to all cardiologists practicing in 4 major cities in Pakistan (Karachi, Lahore, Quetta and Peshawar). A validated, semi-structured questionnaire assessing ESC 2005 Guidelines for HF was used to obtain information from cardiologists. It included questions about awareness and relevance of HF guidelines (See Additional File 1). Respondents' management choices were compared with those of an expert panel based on the guidelines for three fictitious patient cases. Cardiologists were also asked about major barriers to adherence to guidelines. Results A total of 372 cardiologists were approached; 305 consented to participate (overall response rate, 82.0%). The survey showed a very high awareness of CHF guidelines; 97.4% aware of any guideline. About 13.8% considered ESC guidelines as relevant or very relevant for guiding treatment decisions while 92.8% chose AHA guidelines in relevance. 87.2% of respondents perceived that they adhered to the HF guidelines. For the patient cases, the proportions of respondents who made recommendations that completely matched those of the guidelines were 7% (Scenario 1), 0% (Scenario 2) and 20% (Scenario 3). Respondents considered patient compliance (59%) and cost/health economics (50%) as major barriers to guideline implementation. Conclusion We found important self reported departures from recommended HF management guidelines among cardiologists of Pakistan.

In particular, the French-Italian project PAPRIKA is focused on two specific regions in the Hindu-Kush -- Himalaya -- Karakorum (HKKH)region: the Shigar basin in Pakistan, at the feet of K2, and the Khumbu valley in Nepal, at the feet of Mount Everest. In this framework, we use the WRF model to simulate precipitation and meteorological conditions with high resolution in areas with extreme orographic slopes, comparing the model output with station and satellite data. Once validated the model, we shall run a set of three future time-slices at very high spatial resolution, in the periods 2046-2050, 2071-2075 and 2096-2100, nested in different climate change scenarios (EXtreme PREcipitation and Hydrological climate Scenario Simulations -EXPRESS-Hydro project). As a prelude to this study, here we discuss the simulation of specific, high-intensity rainfall events in this area. In this paper we focus on the 2010 Pakistan floods which began in late July 2010, producing heavy monsoon rains in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan regions of Pakistan and affecting the Indus River basin. Approximately one-fifth of Pakistan's total land area was underwater, with a death toll of about 2000 people. This event has been simulated with the WRF model (version 3.3.) in cloud-permitting mode (d01 14 km and d02 3.5 km): different convective closures and microphysics parameterization have been used. A deeper understanding of the processes responsible for this event has been gained through comparison with rainfall depth observations, radiosounding data and geostationary/polar satellite images.\n\nForaminiferal stratigraphy of Ranikot (Paleocene) of Pakistan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKureshy, A.A.\n\n1983-03-01\n\nThe sedimentary deposits of Pakistan are divided into three distinct basins: the Lower Indus basin, the Upper Indus basin, and the Baluchistan basin. The Lower Indus basin is further divided into two parts; the northern part is the Sulaiman Province, and the southern part is known as Kirthar Province. The tertiary stratigraphy of Kirthar Province is conspicuous for its characteristic lithostratigraphic units. The Paleocene deposits of Kirthar Province are designated as Ranikot Group. The Ranikot Group was divided by Cheema et al in 1977 into three distinct lithostratigraphic units: the Khadro formation (Cardita beaumonti beds), Bara formation (Lower Ranikot), andmoreÂ Â» Lakhra formation (Upper Ranikot). The Khadro and Lakhra formations are marine, characterized by foraminiferal assemblages. The characteristic planktonic forms are: Globigerina triloculinoides Plummer, Globorotalia pseudobulloids (Plummer), G. compressa (Plummer), G. valascoensis (Cushman), and G. pseudomenardii Bolli. The diagnostic forms of larger foraminifera are: Nummulites nuttalli Davies, Miscellanea (d'Archiac and Haime), Kathina major Smout, and Lockartia conditii (Nuttall). The planktonic foraminifera were assigned to Globorotali trinidadensis, G. pseudomenardii, and G. velasoensis zones of Kureshy in 1977, and larger foraminifera were assigned to Nummulities nuttalli zones of Kureshy in 1978.Â«Â less\n\nSeismic based characterization of total organic content from the marine Sembar shale, Lower Indus Basin, Pakistan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAziz, Omer; Hussain, Tahir; Ullah, Matee; Bhatti, Asher Samuel; Ali, Aamir\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe exploration and production of unconventional resources has increased significantly over the past few years around the globe to fulfill growing energy demands. Hydrocarbon potential of these unconventional petroleum systems depends on the presence of significant organic matter; their thermal maturity and the quality of present hydrocarbons i.e. gas or oil shale. In this work, we present a workflow for estimating Total Organic Content (TOC) from seismic reflection data. To achieve the objective of this study, we have chosen a classic potential candidate for exploration of unconventional reserves, the shale of the Sembar Formation, Lower Indus Basin, Pakistan. Our method includes the estimation of TOC from the well data using the Passey's ÎlogR and Schwarzkofp's methods. From seismic data, maps of Relative Acoustic Impedance (RAI) are extracted at maximum and minimum TOC zones within the Sembar Formation. A geostatistical trend with good correlation coefficient (R2) for cross-plots between TOC and RAI at well locations is used for estimation of seismic based TOC at the reservoir scale. Our results suggest a good calibration of TOC values from seismic at well locations. The estimated TOC values range from 1 to 4% showing that the shale of the Sembar Formation lies in the range of good to excellent unconventional oil/gas play within the context of TOC. This methodology of source rock evaluation provides a spatial distribution of TOC at the reservoir scale as compared to the conventional distribution generated from samples collected over sparse wells. The approach presented in this work has wider applications for source rock evaluation in other similar petroliferous basins worldwide.\n\nA primer on the occurrence of coalbed methane in low-rank coals, with special reference to its potential occurrence in Pakistan\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSanFilipo, John R.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIntroduction: This report compiles and updates a series of correspondence that took place between 1998 and early 2000 among the author and representatives of various consulting groups operating in the coal sector of Pakistan. The purpose of the original correspondence was to introduce basic concepts of coalbed methane (CBM) in low-rank coals to planners and other parties interested in the development of Pakistan's coal, particularly the large deposits of the Thar desert area of Sindh Province that were recently discovered (SanFilipo and Khan, 1994) by the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The author tested two shallow boreholes in Sindh Province for CBM in 1992, including one in Thar, with very marginal results. Additional targets with better CBM prospects were recommended shortly thereafter (SanFilipo and others, 1994), but these were not followed up during subsequent drilling, nor were any other sites tested. Recent events, notably the rapid pace of CBM development in low-rank coals of the Powder River Basin of the U.S., and a show of CBM in commercial quantities in the Cambay Basin of India - both of which are similar in age and rank to most of Pakistan's coal - have indicated a need for reevaluating the initial CBM investigations made in Pakistan in 1992 and for a reassessment of the CBM prospects for the country at large.\n\nAssessing the combined influence of TOC and black carbon in soil-air partitioning of PBDEs and DPs from the Indus River Basin, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Usman; Mahmood, Adeel; Syed, Jabir Hussain; Li, Jun; Zhang, Gan; Katsoyiannis, Athanasios; Jones, Kevin C; Malik, Riffat Naseem\n\n2015-06-01\n\nLevels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and dechlorane plus (DPs) were investigated in the Indus River Basin from Pakistan. Concentrations of âPBDEs and âDPs were ranged between 0.05 and 2.38 and 0.002-0.53Â ngÂ g(-1) in the surface soils while 1.43-22.1 and 0.19-7.59Â pgÂ m(-3) in the passive air samples, respectively. Black carbon (fBC) and total organic carbon (fTOC) fractions were also measured and ranged between 0.73 and 1.75 and 0.04-0.2%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed strong influence of fBC than fTOC on the distribution of PBDEs and DPs in the Indus River Basin soils. BDE's congener profile suggested the input of penta-bromodiphenylether (DE-71) commercial formulation in the study area. Soil-air partitioning of PBDEs were investigated by employing octanol-air partition coefficients (KOA) and black carbon-air partition coefficients (KBC-A). The results of both models suggested the combined influence of total organic carbon (absorption) and black carbon (adsorption) in the studied area. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

I.; Quick, M. C.\n\nVarious aspects of hydrologic modelling of high mountainous basins in the Punjab Hi- malayan and Karakoram ranges of Northern Pakistan were studied. The runoff from three basins in this region was simulated using the U.B.C. watershed model, which re- quires limited meteorological data of minimum and maximum daily temperature and precipitation. The structure of the model is based on the concept that the hydrolog- ical behavior is a function of elevation and thus, a watershed is conceptualized as a number of elevational zones. A simplified energy budget approach, which is based on daily maximum and minimum temperature and can account for forested and open areas, and aspect and latitude, is used in the U.B.C. model for the estimation of the snowmelt and glacier melt. The studied basins have different hydrological responses and limited data. The runoff from the first basin, the Astore basin, is mainly gener- ated by snowmelt. In the second basin, the Kunhar basin, the runoff is generated by snowmelt but significant redistribution of snow, caused by snow avalanches, affect the runoff generation. The third basin, the Hunza basin, is a highly glacierized basin and its runoff is mainly generated by glacier melt. The application of the U.B.C. watershed model to these three basins showed that the model could estimate reasonably well the runoff generated by the different components.\n\nSource rock potential in Pakistan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRaza, H.A.\n\n1991-03-01\n\nPakistan contains two sedimentary basins: Indus in the east and Balochistan in the west. The Indus basin has received sediments from precambrian until Recent, albeit with breaks. It has been producing hydrocarbons since 1914 from three main producing regions, namely, the Potwar, Sulaisman, and Kirthar. In the Potwar, oil has been discovered in Cambrian, Permian, Jurassic, and Tertiary rocks. Potential source rocks are identified in Infra-Cambrian, Permian, Paleocene, and Eocene successions, but Paleocene/Eocene Patala Formation seems to be the main source of most of the oil. In the Sulaiman, gas has been found in Cretaceous and Tertiary; condensate in CretaceousmoreÂ Â» rocks. Potential source rocks are indicated in Cretaceous, Paleocene, and Eocene successions. The Sembar Formation of Early Cretaceous age appears to be the source of gas. In the Kirthar, oil and gas have been discovered in Cretaceous and gas has been discovered in paleocene and Eocene rocks. Potential source rocks are identified in Kirthar and Ghazij formations of Eocene age in the western part. However, in the easter oil- and gas-producing Badin platform area, Union Texas has recognized the Sembar Formation of Early Cretaceous age as the only source of Cretaceous oil and gas. The Balochistan basin is part of an Early Tertiary arc-trench system. The basin is inadequately explored, and there is no oil or gas discovery so far. However, potential source rocks have been identified in Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene successions based on geochemical analysis of surface samples. Mud volcanoes are present.Â«Â less\n\nDetection of multiple cocirculating wild poliovirus type 1 lineages through environmental surveillance: impact and progress during 2011-2013 in Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlam, Muhammad Masroor; Shaukat, Shahzad; Sharif, Salmaan; Angez, Mehar; Khurshid, Adnan; Malik, Farzana; Rehman, Lubna; Zaidi, Syed Sohail Zahoor\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe environmental surveillance"
