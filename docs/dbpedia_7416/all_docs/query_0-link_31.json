        "text": "Couscous is a traditional dish for Moroccan population, based on wheat semolina and habitually consumed on Fridays and days of family reunion, its design is different according to the regions and according to the availability of the raw material (wheat, barley...). In order to contribute to the reduction of malnutrition in Morocco, this study was carried out. Legumes including lentils have a great role in human diet, they are commonly consumed for their nutritive value specifically proteins and iron. Lentil is among the oldest and most appreciated grain legumes of the Old World. Thus, the current investigation aims to enhance the nutritive value of conventional Moroccan couscous through its preparation by incorporation of lentil semolina into its components. Four experimental variant proportions of grains legumes semolina (25, 50 and 75%) were analyzed, with couscous made of grains lentil semolina only (100%L) and of grains wheat semolina only (0%L) as control. From nutritive point of view, the higher contents of proteins, iron and potassium were found in couscous with addition of 75% of lentil semolina. In effect, the lower content was recorded for conventional Moroccan couscous, and more the percentage of incorporation increased more its content of proteins, iron and potassium increased. Contrariwise, more the percentage increased more carbohydrates and sodium contents decreased. From technological point of view, the addition of lentil semolina at 25% presented the closest results to the technological parameters of conventional Moroccan couscous. Microbiological tests revealed that couscous of wheat semolina only is a favorable environment for the growth of microorganisms. The nutritional value of lentils and their technological characteristics are useful in increasing nutritional and technological value of fortified conventional Moroccan couscous.\n\nThe food arena, which is at the interface of different economic sectors, is characterised by the presence of numerous actors with often different and even competing agendas. This is exacerbated by the lack of a deep and common understanding of the issues at play and their interdependencies. The review paper aims at highlighting the multifaceted and multidimensional relations and linkages between food and nutrition security, diets and food systems in the context of sustainability. The paper addresses also other issues, which are relevant in sustainable food systems context, such as sustainable consumption and production, typical and traditional foods, and food losses and waste. Food security is built on four pillars: availability, access, use, and stability. It is strongly linked to nutrition security. Sustainable diets are environmentally-friendly and contribute to food security and healthy life. The Mediterranean diet, which encompasses a plethora of traditional and typical foods, is considered by many scholars as an example of sustainable diet. Food systems should deliver food security and nutrition for present and future generations that is why all components of food systems should be sustainable, resilient and efficient. Moving towards more sustainable food systems implies also reducing food losses and waste along the food chain. Sustainability should be considered as a dimension of long-term food security. From such a perspective the concept of sustainable diets can play a key role. To address food and nutrition challenges, food systems have to be considered in their entirety, acknowledging the interdependency of consumption and production. These linkages are shown in the global Zero Hunger Challenge initiative and should be highlighted and further operationalized in global food-related strategies (e.g. 10 Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Food Systems) as well as regional strategies such as the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan for the Mediterranean.\n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) has been believed as one of the breakthroughs to addressing multiple global challenges in communication. ICT has demonstrated its potential in improving access to financial, health services and markets in Africa through such platforms as mobile money and other interactive mobile services, especially in east and west African countries. Despite this progress, the spread of ICT in most Sub-Saharan African countries, including Malawi, has been low. Analyzing the potential of integration of ICT in agricultural extension in Malawi, this review highlights the opportunities and challenges for rolling out ICT based agricultural extension service delivery. The review showed that a large population having low or no computer literacy, and residing in rural areas, with poor infrastructure such as electricity and roads, limited the exploitation of ICT potentials. Furthermore, the capacity of local institutions to generate adequate content for ICT is constrained by small number of ICT professionals and huge dependence on imports of both ICT content and equipment. On the positive note, the growth and spread of 3G internet coverage across Malawi, inability of extension staff to meet farmers’ demands for information, and improvements in flexibility to use and portability of ICT gadgets in remote areas makes ICT more appealing. Moreover, a favorable policy environment, which recognizes the potential of ICT to address the current challenges in the country, offers more opportunities for ICT integration in agricultural extension. A holistic approach is, therefore, recommended as an option for enhancing ICT integration in developing countries.\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is characterized by a nutritional model that remained constant over time and space, consisting mainly of olive oil, cereals, fresh or dried fruit and vegetables, a moderate amount of fish, dairy and meat, and many condiments and spices. However, the Mediterranean Diet is more than just food, because its adoption brings about multidimensional benefits regarding the four dimensions of sustainability (environment, economy, society and culture, nutrition-health). Hence, IFMeD and CIHEAM Bari, in collaboration with FAO and Forum on Mediterranean Food Cultures, developed a new framework called “Med Diet 4.0”, in which the four dimensions are incorporated to assess the sustainability of the Mediterranean Diet. Currently, there are several challenges for the further development of the “Med Diet 4.0” model, such as understanding the interdependences and importance of the four sustainability dimensions, selecting and prioritizing a set of sustainability indicators, calculating a sustainability score using the data gathered for each indicator, and choosing the scale for testing the model. Taking into consideration the abovementioned challenges, this research aims to assess the sustainability of the Mediterranean Diet by implementing the “Med Diet 4.0” model through a participatory Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) framework. This framework has been tested using a set of 56 sustainability indicators in a pilot project entitled “The Apulian Lifestyle for a happy long life”, which took into consideration also the sustainability of the Mediterranean Diet in other 9 regions of Southern Italy. The MCDA framework enabled to assess the overall sustainability score of the Mediterranean Diet and the score related to each dimension in all the regions of Southern Italy. Furthermore, this framework made it possible to delineate the sustainability profile of Apulia region according to the different indicators and to each dimension. By analyzing this profile, brief recommendations of intervention were formulated to support the government of Apulia region in improving the sustainability of the Mediterranean Diet at the regional level.\n\nMany surveys carried out in last years in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) showed that one of the most important problems faced by farmers and rural entrepreneurs is the lack of and/or difficult access to financial resources. The paper aims at analysing rural finance and access to credit in south-eastern BiH. An exploratory survey was performed in March 2013 with 147 rural households from Vlasenica, Han Pijesak, Milici, Zvornik, Rogatica, Pale, Bratunac, Sokolac and Foca municipalities. About a half of the interviewees used loans for different purposes such as the purchase of agricultural equipment and machines, agricultural input, livestock and transport equipment and renovation of buildings but also for covering children education expenses or even for repayment of other debts. The interviewed rural households prefer borrowing from the formal sector (banks), followed by the informal sector (friends, relatives, private moneylender, supplier credits) then the semiformal sector (micro-fin...\n\nA robust institutional framework is necessary to turn into reality the ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which encompasses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This review paper analyses the institutional arrangements and governance mechanisms adopted in the Mediterranean countries for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It is mainly based on an analysis of the Voluntary National Reviews submitted by Mediterranean countries to the United Nations’ High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) from 2016 to 2019. Basically, a variety of institutional arrangements have been used by Mediterranean countries with the aim of ensuring an effective and operational inter-ministerial coordination (cf. “whole-of-government” approach). In this respect, there are two types of institutional mechanisms: coordinating mechanisms at the highest government level (e.g. national committee under prime minister’s or president’s office) and implementation coordination by specific ministries (e.g. Ministry of Development in Turkey, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cyprus and Morocco, Ministry of Tourism and Sustainable Development in Montenegro). Some countries opted for the establishment of new structures (e.g. National committee for monitoring the implementation of SDGs in Egypt), while others use the institutional arrangements put in place for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Apart from inter-ministerial coordination, these institutional arrangements also aim to ensure the “localisation” of the SDGs and their implementation at sub-national level (e.g. regional, local), increase the involvement of the legislative power and parliaments in the process, and improve the inclusiveness of and ownership by a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. civil society, private sector, academia). The achievement of the SDGs implies going beyond fragmented, hierarchical and “siloed” processes and cultures and working across institutional boundaries. Finally, this review provides evidence of good practices and helps to promote mutual learning among Mediterranean countries.\n\nClimate change as well as environmental degradation (e.g. water shortage, soil depletion), agricultural productivity, food security, population growth and economic and societal (in-) stability are important challenges in Morocco. Moreover, small size of farms, plot fragmentation and inadequate financing are additional constraints faced by Moroccan farmers. Therefore, agricultural extension and advisory services (AEAS) have an important role in supporting them. This study attempts to investigate the contribution of the public AEAS to the agriculture and rural development in Morocco. Paper is based on an extended literature review. The results show that Moroccan farmers have a variety of needs and priorities that exceed the traditional new agricultural technologies demand. AEAS suffer of many weaknesses such as: lack of human resources and their oldness; gender biased ratio (women represent only about 12% of total extension agents); weak linkages and lack of collaboration between extension agents, researchers and farmers. To overcome this situation, the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries elaborated a new strategic vision for AEAS. It is built around three axes: private agricultural extension fostering, revitalization of public extension services and empowering farmers’ representative bodies and organizations. To implement these axes, the National Office for Agricultural Advisory Services (ONCA) was established in February2013 and its mission consists in providing trainingtoextension ONCA's staff at all administrative levels (local, provincial, regional and national); establishing a rigorous planning of extension activities at national and regional levels; strengthening linkages with the research system; adapting themes and messages to target groups and introducing new extension approaches specifically for rural women and family agriculture.\n\nRural population has increasingly turned to tourism for achieving greater economic activity diversification. Rural tourism is considered as a form of alternative tourism. It includes tourism products and services in which the rural culture and assets are a key component. Rural tourism encompasses a huge range of activities, attractions, amenities and facilities. The paper aims at analyzing rural tourism in south-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina with a particular focus on structures management and services diversification. Primary data were collected by a questionnaire survey performed in summer 2012 with 45 owners and managers of rural tourism structures in 11 Bosnian municipalities. Different types of rural tourism structures can be found in the surveyed area. The clientele includes foreign tourists as well as locals. For most of the interviewed operators rural tourism is the primary activity. Visitors are attracted by typical food and drinks, diversified services offer, natural surroundings and landscape beauty. These are also the resources that could be used in the future for rural tourism development. Rural tourism structures provide a wide range of products and services including accommodation, food, recreational activities and organization of celebrations especially in summer. Most of them offer typical food from the region. They use different promotion channels and tools such as internet, billboards, advertising but they also rely on customers’ recommendations. Bosnia has great potential for developing rural tourism, which can provide new opportunities windows for Bosnian rural areas, but it remains largely unexpressed. For unlocking rural tourism potential public support is highly needed.\n\nAnimal production is an agriculture sub-sector together with crop production, fisheries and forestry. Agriculture is at the centre of the debate on sustainability and sustainable development. However, such a debate has, generally, two weaknesses; it ignores the contribution of livestock in agriculture and focuses on agriculture production rather than the whole food system. Therefore, the objective of this review is to analyse the relationship between livestock and sustainable food systems and to explore its implications in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). After introducing the concept of sustainable food systems and providing an overview on the 17 SDGs, the paper explores linkages between agro-food systems and the SDGs. The analysis of the role of livestock in the context of the SDGs – both positive contributions and negative impacts as well as trade-offs – focuses on SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 13 (Climate action) and SDG 15 (Life on land). The review shows that livestock, sustainable food systems and the SDGs are strongly related. It also points out that intensive livestock systems, which are dominant nowadays especially in some developed countries, may jeopardise the achievement of the SDGs. Therefore, the paper argues that de-intensification – e.g. through conversion to environmentally-friendly livestock systems such as organic farming – can allow keeping the multifaceted and multidimensional benefits of the livestock sector while decreasing its negative externalities. This will contribute to the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda as well as other regional agendas (e.g. CIHEAM Strategic Agenda 2025 in the Mediterranean region).\n\nCities depend on a constant food supply from the outside. Current challenges (e.g. climate change, soil depletion, biodiversity loss) and their interrelatedness with modern, industrialised food production may compromise future food security for millions of urban dwellers. Evidence shows that grassroots initiatives can foster transition towards resilient and sustainable urban food systems. This research contributes to the literature on grassroots initiatives and their role in sustainability transitions by analysing the urban gardening project campus garden GrüneBeete e.V. in Muenster. Semi-structured interviews with key informants from the initiative served as a basis for the analysis that was conducted according to an integrated sustainability transition framework. The analysis was performed along the three elements of the Multi-Level Perspective, i.e. niche, regime and landscape. Potential leverage points for transition, sustainability dimensions the initiative touches and its impacts were also studied. Special attention was devoted to social practices in educational and communal spheres. Urban gardening can be considered as a radical niche that aims to create an alternative urban food system. However, the analysed initiative has developed anchoring mechanisms with the regime institutions. Therefore, campus garden GrüneBeete e.V. is rather a symbiotic niche that, nevertheless, has the potential to induce a cumulative, incremental transformation in the regime. The main levers of change used by the initiative are raising awareness and spreading knowledge. In doing so, the campus garden impacts different dimensions of sustainable food systems (environmental, human, social, cultural, political, economic/financial). While the initiative is still small, it has a high upscaling potential given the favourable institutional and political landscape in Muenster and Germany at large. Urban gardening can be identified as a growing, but rather regime-compatible niche, one main strength being its potential impact on society’s beliefs and value systems, and fuelling sustainability transitions through influencing social practices."
