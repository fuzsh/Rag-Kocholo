        "text": "The concern about sustainability is growing and the Mediterranean diet has been extensively identified as a promising model, with benefits for human and environmental health. This systematic review aims to identify and describe the indicators that have been used to evaluate the sustainability of the Mediterranean diet and the results from their application. A methodology using PRISMA guidelines was followed, and searches were performed in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and GreenFile. A total of 32 studies assessing the sustainability of the Mediterranean diet were identified. Twenty-five of these studies quantified the environmental impact, 7 studies evaluated the nutritional quality, and 12 studies assessed the daily cost of this dietary pattern. A total of 33 distinct indicators were identified, of which 10 were used to assess the environmental dimension (mainly, carbon, water, and ecological footprint), 8 were used to assess the nutritional dimension (mainly Health score and Nutrient Rich Food Index), 1 was used to assess the economic dimension (dietary cost), and 8 used combined indicators. The remaining 6 indicators for the assessment of sociocultural dimension were only identified in 1 study but were not measured. The Mediterranean diet had a lower environmental impact than Western diets and showed a carbon footprint between 0.9 and 6.88 kg CO 2 /d per capita, a water footprint between 600 and 5280 m 3 /d per capita, and an ecological footprint between 2.8 and 53.42 m 2 /d per capita. With regard to the nutritional dimension, the Mediterranean diet had a high nutritional quality and obtained 122 points on the Health score and ranged between 12.95 and 90.6 points on the Nutrient Rich Food Index. The cost of the Mediterranean diet is similar to other diets and varied between 3.33 and 14.42€/d per capita. These findings show that no uniformity in assessing the MDiet's sustainability exists. Adv Nutr 2022;00:1-26. Statement of Significance: Although several articles have presented the Mediterranean diet (MDiet) as a sustainable diet, it is not clear how this sustainability is being assessed by different authors. This systematic literature review aims to fill this gap, by identifying and describing the indicators used to evaluate the sustainability of the MDiet, taking into account the several sustainability dimensions and looking at the results from their application.\n\nIn the framework of the Agriculture & Quality programme of Apulia region (southeastern Italy), in addition to the issues of quality, CIHEAM-Bari started a pilot project to promote the sustainability of the products with a regional voluntary quality scheme. Therefore, the products that adhere to the quality scheme should not only comply with the quality requirements defined by the technical specifications but also with sustainability requirements. The pilot project is one of the activities started after the international seminar organized by CIHEAM in collaboration with FAO on \"Sustainability of food systems in the Mediterranean Area\" in Malta in September 2012. The aim is to apply the methodology proposed in Malta to a well-defined territorial context (i.e. Apulia region) by developing the most appropriate indicators to assess the sustainability of Apulian products adhering to the quality scheme. This preliminary communication on the ongoing pilot project presents the methodological approach adopted, the sustainability criteria and themes identified and some indicators selected to assess the economic, environmental, socio-cultural and nutritional-health sustainability of Apulian quality agro-food products.\n\nThe sustainability challenge requires systemic changes in food systems. In such a landscape, sustainabilityy assessments are gaining a certain centrality as benchmark setting and information tools to support choices of various food-stakeholder groups, including consumers, corporate and public buyers, investors and policy-makers. To be coherent with the high expectations placed on them, all assessment approaches have to address questions about their quality, such as legitimacy, validity, relevance and usefulness. As the complexity of the sustainability issue is more widely acknowledged, sustainability assessments appear to be especially vulnerable to these quality challenges. In this regard, ENEA is pursuing a new approach to indicators (Stefanova and Iannetta, 2016), based on soft and critical systems methodologies (Ramage and Shipp, 2009). Within such an approach, indicators are considered only as shortcuts linked to the development models they aim to inform and the central focus is on establishing consistent links between indicators and models as well as maintaining such consistency over time. Development models are based on often overlapping but still not identical perspectives on how sustainable food systems can be achieved (Garnett, 2014). A central question of our approach is how to incorporate different perspectives into sustainability assessment methodologies. This paper addresses the above question through a discussion on voluntary sustainability standards (VSSs). VSSs bear a potential to be considered sustainable innovations (Hautamäki, 2016a). They are believed to be systemic in nature, due to their potential of changing not only producers’ behaviour, but also markets and consumers’ behaviour (Gruère, 2013). However, to consider them sustainable innovations, as stressed in (Hautamäki, 2016a), it is essential to assess their impacts and their effectiveness in keeping the promises they try to convey to various food system stakeholders.\n\nDespite the recurring discourse on food systems and their sustainability in the Mediterranean region, compre-hensive studies are hard to find. Therefore, this article provides an overview on the challenges and perspectives of food systems in the Mediterranean. In particular, the paper addresses the main challenges (environmental, economic, socio-cultural and nutrition-health) facing Mediterranean food systems; analyses the multifaceted relations between sustainable food systems (SFS) and sustainable diets by exploring the example of the Medi-terranean diet; and briefly presents the relevance of the innovation for Mediterranean food systems. The paper highlights the urgency of action to move towards sustainable and resilient food systems in the Mediterranean area. This is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For that, there is a need for shared policy, governance, practice and research agenda. In this respect, the contribution of CIHEAM results fundamental. ..."
