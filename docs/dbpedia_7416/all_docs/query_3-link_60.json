        "text": "Hello guys. Hope you all continue to stay safe from the worst ever pandemic the world has witnessed. Even if that question is not relevant here, I should still ask if you continue to stay safe during the current situation. The monsoon is prevailing over the country and many human lives have been impacted especially in the northern states. Himachal Pradesh was the state which was the most impacted during the rains with landslides occurring in many parts of the state. Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan were the other states impacted. The water level of Yamuna river has gone high for the first time in 40 years which led to flooding and water logging in many parts of Delhi city. There was a long break on the blog for around two months. There were many reasons why I had to take a break on the blog. One reason was that I was busy planning one of the most awaited journeys in my life which had finally happened in the month of June. Adding to that were also professional commitments with much more pressure added to work and many new faces coming in at workplace and some not even giving senior colleagues a moment to relax and hanging around like python squeezing its prey. What we shouldn’t forget is that once they learn everything related to work, they won’t even like us pointing out the mistakes they have made in work or won’t even mind us when they come across us on the floor. It’s not just people at workplace but people in our family are also the same at times when they have people to support them better who make them turn against us. Of course, that is not something new to me in my life but I made a change in the way I react to these kind of people by openly replying in what others may feel as an unwelcome way so that they won’t approch us often. This is what I learnt from my previous experiences and I’m thinking of performing the same act again to these people who pretend to have respect towards us just to gain knowledge from us and then to ignore us afterwards. It’ll take quite sometime to get rid of these people but during the long flow, it will happen automatically. Let me not prolong the intro for this post by talking much about these kind of idiotic people. In our last post, we traveled to Madhya Pradesh to visit the historic city of Mandu. Today, moving away from our common trend, I’m going to compose something different. It can’t be said as completely different topic as there is always a space for it in every post of mine. So let’s have a look at how T20 cricket is flourishing around the world today.\n\nThe 2023 Indian Premier League has concluded with Chennai Super Kings securing their fifth title by beating Gujarat Titans in the final. With just a month after the conclusion of the tournament, the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket has commenced in the United States. Four of the six teams are owned by stakeholders of the IPL teams and the teams have sticked on to their IPL contingent for the Major League. Sunil Narine led the Los Angeles Knight Riders which has a strong domestic contingent in Ali Khan, Unmukt Chand, Jaskaran Malhotra, Nitish Kumar, Corne Dry, Saif Badar, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Sheikh, Bhaskar Yadram and Gajanand Singh. They have also added the Kolkata Knightriders trio of Andre Russell, Jason Roy and Lockie Ferguson along with Martin Guptill, Adam Zampa, Rilee Rossouw and Spencer Johnson. MI New York named Kieron Pollard as their skipper, despite the West Indian retiring from the IPL and added some notable domestic players in Steven Taylor, Hammad Azam, Ehsan Adil, Noshtush Kenjige, Monank Patel, Sarabjit Ladda, Shayan Jahangir, Kyle Phillip, Saideep Ganesh and Jasdeep Singh. They also added overseas players who are part of various Mumbai Indians franchises in Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Tim David, Dewald Brevis, Kagiso Rabada, Nicholas Pooran, Jason Behrendorff and Tristan Stubbs and also included David Wiese, who became part of an MI franchise for the first time. Seattle Orcas, who are owned by an investor group which also includes the owners of the Delhi Capitals are led by Wayne Parnell, who also leads the Pretoria Capitals in the SA20. The squad includes notable domestic signings in Harmeet Singh, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Cameron Gannon, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Angelo Perera and Nisarg Patel.

With the team having no ownership ties with any IPL franchises, the squad included the likes of Anrich Nortje, Marco Jansen, Glenn Phillips, Adam Milne, Josh Philippe, Ben Dwarshuis, Tanveer Sangha and Matthew Short. Wanindu Hasaranga withdrew prior to the start of the tournament due to clash with the Lanka Premier League.\n\nThe Global T20 Canada has returned after four years with the 2020, 2021 and 2022 editions not being held due to Covid-19 pandemic and other reasons. This season features the introduction of two new teams with defending champions Winnipeg Hawks and Edmonton Royals dissolved and replaced by Surrey Jaguars and Mississauga Panthers. Surrey Jaguars are led by Pakistani all-rounder Ifthikar Ahmed and includes the likes of Alex Hales, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Litton Das, Ben Cutting, Mohammad Haris and Matthew Forde. The squad also features prominent players from the associate nations in Sandeep Lamichhane, Ayaan Khan, Jatinder Singh and Bernard Scholtz and local players Pargat Singh and Dilon Heyliger. Karim Janat and Jason Behrendorff withdrew prior to the start of the tournament while Spencer Johnson joined the squad after his stint with the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Shoaib Malik leads the newly formed Mississauga Panthers which includes prominent overseas players in Chris Gayle, Azam Khan, James Neesham, Cameron Delport and Usman Qadir. Tom Cooper and Zahoor Khan are the associate players in the squad. Cecil Pervez, Jaskaran Singh, Navneet Dhaliwal, Nikhil Dutta and Shreyas Movva are the Canadian players in the lineup.

The squad also includes prominent overseas players in Harbhajan Singh, Colin de Grandhomme, Mark Chapman, Hussain Talat, Usman Khan and Chris Green and associate players Logan van Beek, Jan Frylinck and Max O’Dowd. Jeremy Gordon, Aaron Johnson, Rizwan Cheema, Shahid Ahmadzai and Rishav Joshi are the prominent Canadian players in the squad. Usama Mir withdrew prior to the start of the tournament. Montreal Tigers are led by Chris Lynn and added a strong overseas contingent in Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan, Sherfane Rutherford, Carlos Brathwaite, Abbas Afridi and Zahir Khan.

Canadian wicketkeeper Hamza Tariq will lead the Toronto Nationals who included prominent overseas players in Colin Munro, Shahid Afridi, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Zaman Khan, Saim Ayub and Faheem Ashraf in their lineup. Gerhard Erasmus and JJ Smit are the associate representatives in the squad while Farhan Malik, Saad Bin Zafar and Nicholas Kirton are the prominent Canadian players. Abdullah Shafique and Sikandar Raza withdrew prior to the start of the tournament. Vancouver Knights, who won the inaugural edition of the tournament in 2018, are led by South African batsman Rassie van der Dussen and will have the likes of Mohammad Rizwan, Fakhar Zaman, Reeza Hendricks, Corbin Bosch, Najibullah Zadran and Fabian Allen. Emirati cricketers Vriitya Aravind, Junaid Siddique and Karthik Meiyappan and Namibia’s Ruben Trumpelmann are the associate representatives while Junaid Siddique, Ravinderpal Singh, Harsh Thaker, Rayyan Pathan and Kanwarpal Tathgur are the prominent Canadian players in the squad. Naveen-ul-Haq withdrew from the squad prior to the start of the tournament.\n\nThe 2023 season of the Hundred will commence on 1 August. I’ve already shared the list of retained players in one of my previous posts. Now, let us have a look at the draft picks and wildcard and replacement signings post the draft. Welsh Fire signed Tom Abell, David Willey, Roelof van der Merwe, Stephen Eskinazi and Daniel Douthwaite as domestic signings and Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Glenn Phillips as overseas signings. Luke Wells and Chris Cooke have been signed later as wildcard players. Southern Brave, champions of the inaugural edition of the tournament have already retained core of their squad from previous season and boosted up their lineup by adding Leus du Plooy and using the retention pick to buy back Tim David and bought back Devon Conway, who was part of their squad in the inaugural edition. Jafer Chohan and Matthew Fisher have been picked as wildcard signings later. Mitchell Santner will play for the Brave as replacement for David during later stages of the tournament. Oval Invincibles added all-rounder Ross Whiteley to their line-up and also bolstered their overseas contingent by signing Heinrich Klaasen and Pakistani pacer Ihsanullah. Zimbabwe born Tawenda Muyeye and Zak Chappell have been signed as wildcard players. The Invincibles will partially miss the services of Sunil Narine, who was the only overseas player retained by them and will be replaced by Adam Zampa. James Neesham will replace Heinrich Klaasen when he departs to play for South Africa. Northern Superchargers will led by Wayne Parnell this season with Ben Stokes continuing to be a part of the squad.

Manchester Originals brought back Laurie Evans and Ashton Turner, who were part of their squad for the previous season with former leading the side into the final where they lost to Trent Rockets. They also signed pacer Josh Tongue who made his debut for England in tests and will now be looking to bolster the chances of a T20 callup.

They have got a strong Caribbean contingent in Fabian Allen, Jermaine Blackwood, Shamarh Brooks, Hayden Walsh Jr, Raymon Reifer Steven Taylor and Kirk McKenzie. Their core overseas lineup was also retained from last year with Imad Wasim, Mohammad Amir and Chris Green being picked once again.

Rovman Powell will take over as captain of the Barbados Royals and will be joined in the side by Jason Holder, Kyle Mayers, Alick Athanaze, Obed McCoy, Akeem Jordan, Rahkeem Cornwall, Joshua Bishop, Nyeem Young and Ramon Simmonds.

Parallel to this, Zimbabwe’s Zim Afro T10 is also going on which includes retired Indian cricketers as well. The 2023-24 Big Bash League will commence in December and the list of overseas players retained is yet to be announced eventhough many domestic player transfers have been announced. The tournament will run parallel with the Super Smash T20 tournament in New Zealand, which is the only T20 tournament without overseas players at present. The SA20 and International League T20 will follow the tournaments which will be followed by the Bangladesh Premier League and Pakistan Super League and finally the Indian Premier League and T20 Blast. The initial signings and retentions for SA20 and ILT20 have been announced. There have been significant player movements from ILT20 to the SA20 ahead of the second seasons of the two tournaments. Moeen Ali will turn out for Joburg Super Kings this season who retained Faf du Plessis and Gerald Coetzee from previous season and bolstered their lineup by signing David Wiese, Sam Cook and Zahir Khan. Liam Livingstone will return to MI Cape Town this season after missing the previous season due to injury and retained their core players Kagiso Rabada, Dewald Brevis, Sam Curran and Rashid Khan and added Tom Banton ahead of the auction. Defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape retained their skipper Aiden Markaram and Ottniel Baartman and signed Dawid Malan and Liam Dawson (who played in ILT20 in the previous season) ahead of the auction. Paarl Royals unsurprisingly retained David Miller, Joss Buttler and Corbin Bosch while the Pretoria Capitals retained Anrich Nortje, Migael Pretorius and James Neesham. Durban’s Super Giants retained Quinton de Kock, Prenelan Subrayen and Kyle Mayers from previous season and signed up Naveen-ul-Haq, Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Reece Topley ahead of the auction. Sharjah Warriors who will miss the services of Moeen Ali, Dawid Malan and Naveen-ul-Haq in this season of ILT20, have retained only six players from previous season which includes Chris Woakes, Joe Denly, Mark Deyal and Tom Kohler-Cadmore. Abu Dhabi Knight Riders who finished at the bottom of the table last season, retained only eight of the players from the previous squad. Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Charith Asalanka, Ali Khan, Marchant de Lange and Joe Clarke are some of the prominent names who will turn up in the second season. MI Emirates have retained core of their squad from the previous season. Kieron Pollard, Trent Boult, Dwayne Bravo, , Nicholas Pooran, Andre Fletcher, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Dan Mousley, Jordan Thompson, McKenny Clarke, Will Smeed and Emiratis Muhammad Waseem and Zahoor were retained. Rashid Khan, who joined the squad for the playoffs was not among the retentions or the released players list but is part of the MI Cape Town players list for the second edition of SA20 and may turn up for MI Emirates again during later stage of the tournament. Dubai Capitals retained only five players in Joe Root, Rovman Powell, Sikandar Raza, Dushmantha Chameera and Akif Raja. Desert Vipers, who were the runners-up of the inaugural edition, retained core of their squad including Alex Hales, Colin Munro, Dinesh Chandimal, Luke Wood, Matheesha Pathirana, Sheldon Cottrell, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, Tom Curran, Rohan Mustafa and Gus Atkinson. Sam Billings, Adam Lyth, Benny Howell and Tymal Mills were among the notable omissions. Defending champions Gulf Giants have also retained core of their squad from previous season including James Vince, Chris Lynn, Chris Jordan, Jamie Overton, Gerhard Erasmus, Rehan Ahmed, Richard Gleeson, Shimron Hetmyer and Sanchit Sharma. There may be a transfer of players from SA20 to ILT20 or vice versa or among teams in the same league.\n\nWell, that was quite a different topic to start the new phase of the blog. Why I mentioned new phase is because this is the first post I’m composing after my 29th birthday. I mentioned that I completed a memorable journey which I’ve been waiting for long. I actually would have liked to share my experiences about the journey in this post but I believe we need the backdrop of a journey to talk about another journey. So let us have a very short conclusion for this post compared to our usual way of a long conclusion mentioning characters from real life. Once again, thank you all for your valuable feedback and support you’ve given to the blog even during the inactivity period. Requesting you all to stay safe and make the use of sanitisers and masks whenever necessary and also get vaccinated with two doses in case you haven’t. Have a great time ahead and will be back with you very soon with more interesting blogs."
