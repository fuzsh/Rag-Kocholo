        "text": "Much like how silicone preserves the trout beyond death, language preserves the thoughts which once defined us as individuals. In all lingual contexts; the vitality and capability for communication occurs as an inevitability (verbal or non-verbal) within our social propensities – language proves to be the only constant in all areas of our progression. As Ludwig Wittgenstein describes, “the limits of my language means the limits of my world” (TLP 5.62; 1921), the figurative boundary of our literal being, the beta to our alpha, the sign-post pointing one direction on our journey through life. I’m getting a tad off of topic, but I hope my mild transgressions and editorial implements don’t distract from the point of this post, that being, discussing the life-cycle of one of the most important philosophers of our time! Deeper descriptions of Wittgensteinian philosophy and writings will be within other posts, as simply put, even I believe it would be too much of a mouthful for even the most avid reader to swallow if I was to include everything in one mere blog.\n\nIn terms of the reading of this extensive yet minutely detailed biography, though I see it as far below comprehensive, I fully recommend taking breaks whilst reading – that being for the purpose of both physical & mental circulation purposes!\n\n“Maybe the best way to pass along a feel for this kind of thing is to do what people have always done when they’ve got a great deal of complicated information to convey, and that’s tell a story” (Garvey & Stangroom, pg. 1, 2012)\n\nNadir, or Zenith, Beginnings?\n\nBorn in the entertainingly titled ‘Wittgenstein Palace‘ (“Argentinierstrasse“, Vienna) as the youngest son to a wide family of 8 brothers and sisters, Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein (26th April, 1889) was fortunate in receiving strong financial support from his parents, Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847-1913), & Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kallmus-Wittgenstein (1850-1926) – though admittedly, rather poor emotional and social attentiveness from said parents. His siblings were as follows; Hermine Mining Wittgenstein (1847-1950), Hans Johannes Wittgenstein (1877-1902; suicide), Kurt Konrad Wittgenstein (1878-1918; suicide), Helene Leuka Salzer-Wittgenstein (1879-1956), Rudolf Rudi Wittgenstein (1881-1904; suicide), Margarethe Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein (1882-1958), Paul Wittgenstein (1887-1961) & Dora Wittgenstein (1876-1876; premature) (Geni, 2018).\n\nHis father, renowned as an industrial tycoon, was one of the richest individuals in Europe, dominating the Austrian-steel industry; leading to the Wittgenstein’s becoming the 2nd wealthiest family in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1st being the Rothschild‘s) by the 1890’s (Edmonds & Eidinow, 2001). Despite there being many historical points of financial hardship within Austria (e.g. 1922 Hyperinflation/ 1929 Great Depression), substantial investment into organisations based in the Netherlands & Switzerland allowed the Wittgenstein family to avoid the difficulties faced by the rest of the country.\n\nThe children of the family were all baptised as Christian Catholics, & raised in an intense environment centred around such beliefs of spiritualism and centred charity (Malcolm & Winch, 1994) – an “all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture” (Bruno Walter; a conductor of Paul Wittgenstein (who was a pianist); 1876-1962; Monk, 1990), likely explaining Wittgenstein’s partially spiritual approach towards philosophising more divine prospects.\n\nAlways a refuter of more contemporary music, Ludwig showed an immediate affection towards the creations of Mozart & Beethoven; himself writing detailed musical passages (along with his brother Paul, as to which there was some mild sibling competition), and demonstrating an extensive usage of musical metaphors in his writings (Monk, 1990).\n\nSeen as having an apathetic & serious demeanour, the private-home education & commanding socialisation provided by Karl unto his children led to the instigation of more volatile & depressive personalities in their future development (Hans, Rudolf & Kurt eventually committing suicide) – him being seen as a harsh perfectionist, contrasting the more submissive & anxious personality of their mother, Leopoldine (Michael Fitzgerald, n.d.). It was these factors amongst the Wittgenstein family which lead many (including myself) to surmise the potential for Ludwig, amongst his brother Hans, Rudolf & Kurt, to have been highly autistic individuals, nearer to Asperger’s syndrome in their functionality and creatively expressive yet socially retracted personalities. This is conjectured in regards to the fantastic capabilities of these individuals in specific areas (e.g. music, mathematics, philosophy), bordering on pathological obsession with more specific areas of function – which is namely associated with autistic persons in their behelding to weak central coherence, with high levels of focus on minor and localised details (Happé, 2011). This will be further examined in the later discussion of Ludwig’s obsession with the details of construction, when he later headed such with the architectural design and leading of Haus Wittgenstein from 1926 to 1929 (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nTaught under private-home tutoring until the age of 14, the suicides of Hans (under mysterious circumstances when he was said to have “ran away to America”) & Rudolf (due to the negative perception of homosexuals at the time, which led him to take his own life upon disowning from his father) led Karl to relent from private education, and allow Wittgenstein to attend the Realschule (in Linz) for his first 3 years of formal education, beginning in 1903. During his time in education, Ludwig was described as a “stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart …” (Goldstein, 1999), reflecting his interactive incapabilities, for which he was bullied relentlessly (Monk, 1990).\n\nDuring his time at Realschule, Wittgenstein converted towards more atheistic ideology (though still believed in the importance of spiritual confession) – adopting the epistemological idealism of Arthur Schopenhauer (German philosopher; 1788-1860), maintaining Catholic spiritualism, yet refusing to formally accept himself as Christian. Despite such, he claimed “I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view” (Monk, 1990), with his beliefs being fundamentally aligned with that of religious discourse. Norman Malcolm (American philosopher; 1911-1990) wrote of such in his book (Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View?; 1993); “Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers” – utilising personal spirituality to elucidate & clarify prior thoughts.\n\nLudwig’s time at Realschule concluded in 1906, whereby his next step was the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg to study mechanical engineering.\n\nLudwig’s Sexuality; the influence of Otto Weininger\n\nOtto Weininger (Austrian philosopher; 1880-1903) wrote the book; Geschlecht und Charakter (“Sex & Character“, 1903; himself committing suicide shortly following the publishing of the book), which greatly influenced a young Wittgenstein with the idea of sexuality falling under platonic forms, encapsulating a theoretical though not practical existence (New World Encyclopedia, 2019). These ideas centralised how man must choose between the sides of masculinity & femininity, consciousness & unconsciousness, platonic affection & sexuality – meaning the love between man & woman are doomed to failure as a consequence of how true love & sexual desire fall in contradiction. Consequently, the only fruitful life would be one of spirituality – a choice between genius, & death (Monk, 1990), love itself being the wholesome, platonic and uncomplicated desire for connection and association between two persons.\n\nThe readings of such text can only be presumed to have influenced Wittgenstein to be more overtly homosexual, no longer seeing female companionship as a romantic capability; sparking an ensuing bisexual approach to life where relationships towards men through an intellectual bond upheld prioritisation, as within the time period men were moreso educated than women and thus were a more understandable target for platonic, intellectual companionship. Though Wittgenstein showed appreciation for such works, he partially disagreed, writing to G.E. Moore (English philosopher; 1873-1958) many years later in 1931; “It isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great“; meaning to Ludwig, the manner of the inaccuracies was more interesting than the philosophy itself. However, he never seemed to ever define his area of disagreement, so presumptions of such are merely speculative – as was Wittgenstein’s confusing yet fascinating nature!\n\nTechnical & Mechanical Education\n\nFrom the age of 10, Ludwig showed great technical & material understandings, consistently breaking apart & re-assembling tools & devices of varying complexity – this was demonstrated in his capability to form a miniature sewing machine from pieces of wire & wood, which was even capable of sewing a few stitches of cloth, a testament to his intelligence and creativity (Monk, 1990). With conditioning from an extensive curriculum pre-set by his father, Ludwig was thrust into a world of intellectual challenge & attainment, behelding constant attention-to-detail and highly local forms of cognitive processing (meaning, a centring of focus on the details of a machination rather than the overall function).\n\nThis precise intrigue led to the study of mechanical engineering in Technische Hochschule (University) in Charlottenburg, Berlin (1906-1908), where he obtained a diploma – this was furthered into striving for a doctorate in aeronautics at the Victoria University of Manchester in the UK (1908-1911), whereby he went into extensive detail regarding engineering aspects such as jet-powered propeller propulsion & research at the Kite-Flying Station in Glossop, Derbyshire. During this time-period, Jim Bamber (engineer; n.d.), a fellow engineer & classmate, described how “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German” (Monk, 1990); as was characteristic of his self-hating attitude – Bamber was an individual whom Wittgenstein would constantly seek pragmatic aid from related to his work in such an area (Portraits of Wittgenstein: Abridged Edition, 2018). William Eccles (fellow student; n.d.), another colleague at the time, referred to how Wittgenstein began to undergo a change where his theoretical focus outweighed his mechanical, with attention more towards the design of a propeller than it’s construction (Monk, 1990) – a concept requiring a high understanding of mathematics, and thus, leading to his philosophical intrigue in the world of numbers and head-scratching (Garvey & Stangroom, 2012).\n\nPhilosophical Epiphany\n\nUpon such an interest in the foundations of mathematics, Ludwig inquired into reading Bertrand Russell‘s (British philosopher/mathematician; 1872-1970) ‘The Principles of Mathematics‘ (1903) along with Gotllob Frege‘s (German philosopher/logician; 1848-1925) ‘The Foundations of Arithmetic‘ (Vol.1; 1893, Vol.2; 1903) (which instilled the ideas of conceptual realism in Ludwig, replacing prior ideas he beheld to Schopenhauer philosophical pessimism and asceticism) to gain further understanding. This led to a loss of interest in aeronautics, and a desire to better understand the epistemology of logic and mathematics, seeing himself as nought more than in a “constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation” (Monk, 1990) when faced with that which he does not yet understand.\n\nIn 1911, he visited Frege at the University of Jena, Germany, to discuss some areas of philosophy & mathematics which Wittgenstein had written. Upon arriving, as he writes; “I was shown into Frege’s study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said ‘You must come again’, so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics” (Kanterian, 2007). Following this event in the summer, Ludwig felt compelled to meet his other intellectual interest, Bertrand Russell, a renowned mathematical logician at the Trinity College (University) in Cambridge. On the 18th October, 1911, Russell is renowned to have written; “an unknown German appeared speaking very little English but refusing to speak German” (BBC Horizon, 1989). This man demonstrated an intense passion for mathematical philosophy, and queried to Russell, “do you think I’m an absolute idiot?“, “if I am I shall become an aeronaut, but if I am not, I shall become a philosopher” (BBC Horizon, 1989). Upon Russell determining such by Wittgenstein’s writing of an assessed essay, Russell claimed; “as soon as I read the first sentence, I became persuaded that he was a man of genius, and I assured him that on no account should he become an aeronaut” (BBC Horizon, 1989). Upon this revelation, Ludwig knew his philosophical drive had been validated, and he moved to Cambridge the next year to study mathematics under Russell, where they shared a highly respectful philosophical insight towards one-another.\n\nThe Cambridge Moral Sciences Club & the ‘Cambridge Apostles‘\n\nIn 1912, Wittgenstein joined the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club, delivering a paper in November of that year whereby he defined philosophy as “all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences” (Pitt, 1982). His constant domination of the society on a conversation & intellectual basis led to eventual complaints in the 1930’s, whereby Ludwig began to attend much less frequently, as a result of a no longer as appreciated presence.\n\nHe was also invited by John Maynard Keynes (famous economist; 1883-1946) to join the elite secret society, known as the Cambridge Apostles, with which he attended infrequently and demonstrated a lacking enjoyment for the prospect. Russell expressed concern for Wittgenstein’s dislike for the raucous intellectual debate, precocious humour & avid discussion which fell outside of his interests (McGuiness, 1967). This led to him resigning almost immediately, yet occasionally tolerating discussion upon his return to Cambridge in the 1920’s. It is also supposed that Wittgenstein digressed from the prolific homosexual nature of the club, despite himself being bisexual, as he believed in more of a mono-amory with partners; an influence from the confliction he experienced internally from reading Weininger’s 1903 texts, as well as his personal platonic experiences.\n\nDavid Pinsent & the ‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus‘\n\nDespite social inadequacy, Ludwig displayed bisexual romantic capabilities, with a multitude of relationships (and potential yet unconfirmed affairs) spanning his lifetime, most of which being men of intellectual ability. David Pinsent (English mathematician; 1891-1918) was one of the most remarked of said individuals, sharing interest in Mozart & Beethoven’s music (which led them to compose together) & mathematics (which they researched together at Cambridge, Wittgenstein in the context of Philosophy & Pinsent in the context of Law). After meeting in 1912, whereby David originally acted as a psychological subject in Ludwig’s investigations of rhythm in speech & music, the two became inseparable. Ludwig utilised his father’s enormous wealth to take him and David on holiday to Iceland and Norway respectively (the latter trip inspiring Wittgenstein to eventually take up residence in the isolated and beautifully-landscaped country – BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nDavid wrote a diary of his travels with Ludwig, describing their time spent abroad as “the most wonderful experience I have ever had“; as well as remarking the admirable independent intellect and unique logic which Ludwig utilised when facing analytical problems (Monk, 1990). The two tended to hire out boats and sail across the lush waters surrounding their abode – while David did most of the sailing, Ludwig pondered troubles of logic & philosophy in the boat with him (in this time, writing ‘Logik‘: Notes on Logic, a predecessor to the TLP which dictates a decision-procedure for determining the truth-value of logical propositions). Pinsent himself was a renowned intellectual, being described by George Thomson (nobel laureate in physics, 1892-1975) as “the most brilliant man of my year, among the most brilliant I have ever met” (Kölbel, 2004).\n\nDavid served as an emotional crutch, in tandem with an intellectual muse, for Ludwig. In written letters, David refers to how Ludwig “felt ashamed of never daring to kill himself“, placing this down to a perpetual morbid conviction of ensuing doom and wasted final hours (BBC Horizon, 1989), thus he showed great compassion for the emotional & mental health of Ludwig throughout their relationship.\n\nTragically, while Ludwig was serving in the Austrian military (& David a test pilot at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough), a plane crash in May of 1918 tore David from Ludwig. Ellen Pinsent (his mother, British Mental health worker; 1866-1949) informed Ludwig in a letter (which he received while still at war) of said news; “I want to tell you how much he loved you, and valued your friendship up to the last“. A man already experiencing emotional turmoils & onset-depressive episodes, this occurence destroyed Ludwig’s only then budding capability for love. In homage to the intellectual who meant so much to him, he dedicated his influential book, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, to David – it is supposed that the book would never have been created without Pinsent’s support and additions during it’s writings (The Conversation, 2018). Ludwig’s prior doubt of ever publishing his works in his lifetime was overridden by the love & support which he had received, yet no longer, would experience.\n\nThe Great War\n\nWhen facing the outcome of war in 1914, Wittgenstein returned to Vienna and enlisted in the Austrian army; during this time, his depression worsened, with an expression of abysmal sleep patterns & eating availability serving to worsen this further. He wrote; “now I shall have the chance to be a decent human being, now I am standing eye-to-eye with death” – in this time, he was rewarded for his courage & bravery, likely due to his own lack of consideration for his well-being. Upon the reaching of the Russian Front in 1914, Ludwig entered a book store, finding the only available book on the shelves was ‘The Gospel In Brief‘ (‘Leo Tolstoy‘; Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, Russian writer; 1828-1910; 1902), which he purchased and kept throughout the continuation of the war (interestingly, despite such, finding the carrying of consecrated bread in a chromium steel container, a highly religious symbol, as ridiculous; Barrett, 2007). During this time, he spent most free moments attempting to philosophise, feeling he was in a constant state of potential breakthrough, yet he perceived a thin veil which he remained incapable of passing through (Monk, 1990). Most of his writings in this time relate to constructs of death and it’s inevitability, likely as a consequence of the horrific conditions he faced and high potential to never return as a result of the high infantry death-rate; “death is not an event in life, it is not a fact of the world … only a man who lives not in time, but in the present, is happy” (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nIn the summer of 1918, Wittgenstein took military leave to stay in one of his family’s many Vienna Summer houses (this one being known as “Neuwaldegg“), whereby he worked on the completion of the TLP (later submitting it with the title ‘Der Satz‘ (“proposition“) to two publishers, Jahoda & Siegel). Near the end of the war, Ludwig received news of David’s passing through a letter from his mother (this arriving in August due to a delay in discovering the body upon the crash in May), creating a further incentive to publish the TLP in honour of the support and motivation which he received from his now lost partner. Following his release from being a prisoner of war in Italy (during which, he finished the TLP; Garvey & Stangroom, 2012) in the August of 1919 (after being captured in November 1918), Ludwig returned to Cambridge to meet with Russell and discuss the book further. The first comment-line of the TLP claimed “this book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it – or similar thoughts – what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence” (TLP 1.01, 1921); fundamentally seeking to cover aspects of how the world itself is independent of us, & language has simply been constructed to describe it. Upon the conclusion of the book, Ludwig believed he had fundamentally solved (moreso, dissolved; as he claimed “philosophical problems are linguistic confusions to be dissolved, not deep questions in need of profound answers“; Garvey & Stangroom, 2012) the philosophical issues of his time, taking influence from his experiences during WW1 & his constant readings of ‘The Gospel in Brief‘ (Leo Tolstoy, 1902) in it’s conception.\n\nHowever, the immense pressure felt from the loss of David Pinsent, as well as multiple losses in the family (and the refusal of Jahoda & Siegel to publish his book), led him to become distraught to an extent of potential suicide. During this time, he wrote; “everyday I think of poor Pinsent, he took half of my life with him, the Devil will take the other half” (BBC Horizon, 1989). Returning to his family in Vienna in August of 1919, Ludwig talked continually of taking his own life, deciding to distribute all of the wealth he had accrued amongst his siblings (most of which received upon the death of his father in 1913), as well as enrol in the Lehrerbildungsanstalt (teacher-training college) in Kundmanngasse, Vienna (1919). This decision was described by his sister, Hermine Mining Wittgenstein (1874-1950), as being reflective of using a precision instrument (Ludwig) to merely open crates (teach at such a low level of education) – though it was a decision which Ludwig stood by (BBC Horizon, 1989). At this point in time, he wanted to be a separate entity from the Wittgenstein family – an individual, alone.\n\nAustrian-Village Schools\n\nUpon the conclusion of teacher-training, Ludwig temporarily worked as a gardener for a Hütteldorf monastery in the summer of 1920 – under a false name, he applied for teaching post in Reichenau, though rescinded once his real identity was discovered. Eventually given his first primary-school teaching job in Trattenbach (this time under his real name), he originally described the locale as beautiful, though in 1921, wrote to Russell at his distaste for the population (Monk, 1990) – most of which despised him and even saw him as slightly mad (especially his colleagues). Unfortunately, issues arose with cases of physical punishment in the classroom when mathematics questions were answered incorrectly, as Ludwig tended to become moody & overly-strict as a consequence of his harsh upbringing. Despite such, it is claimed that the students adored Ludwig’s lessons, as described by Hermine (who would occasionally come to attend Ludwig’s lessons), having “literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations” (Malcolm, 1981). The students tended to find Ludwig’s reply to the headteacher’s playing of piano, that being, shouting “Coleslaw!” at the top of his lungs highly entertaining (BBC Horizon, 1989). Overall, he became something of a legend with the village, being demonstrated as an eccentric character, who continually & abruptly put across his viewpoints whenever the opportunity arose (Monk, 1990).\n\nOne of his former students in these schools, Emmerich Koderhold (also the former mayor; n.d.), described his times with Wittgenstein under his teaching method; “he always noticed interesting things“, “out-doors in the open air, he was happy, in the classroom he was disgruntled, yes, disgruntled” (BBC Horizon, 1989). This displays an instance of an individual who found pleasantries from distracting himself from work, though all the same; felt compelled, if not dutiful, to do such.\n\nFrank Ramsey & the ‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus‘\n\nWhile Ludwig remained in isolation, the TLP was officially published first in German in 1921 (Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung (‘Logical-Philosophical Essay‘), part of Wilhelm Ostwald‘s (nobel laureate in chemistry; 1853-1932) Annalen der Naturphilosophie (‘Annals of the natural philosophy‘) journal). Unsurprisingly, Ludwig himself disliked this version (perceiving it as a “pirate’s edition“; Monk, 1990), Russell’s insistence as well as offer to write an introduction to the book (in order to aid other’s understanding, as well as aid publishing due to his increased notoriety) did little to help, as Ludwig had lost faith in Russell’s more mechanistic interpretation of the Tractatus. Frank Plumpton Ramsey (British philosopher/mathematician; 1903-1930), under the commission of Charles Kay Ogden (English linguist/writer; 1889-1957), began to prepare an English translation of the book (G.E. Moore suggesting the title ‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus‘; in homage to Baruch Spinoza‘s (Jewish-Dutch philosopher; 1632-1677) ‘Tractatus Theologico-Politicus‘ (‘Theologico-Political Treatise‘); with structural affinities and ‘sub specie aeternitatis‘ (Latin; “under the aspect of eternity“) in honorific expression of truth). As expected, issues with finding a publisher came about due to Wittgenstein’s denial of Russell’s introduction, though with Ramsey’s help, an English translation was approved with Russell’s introduction & the Ramsey-Ogden translation (being improved in 1961; translation by Pears/McGuiness) (Monk, 1990).\n\nIn 1923, Ramsey sought out Wittgenstein in Puchberg, Austria (where he was now working at a different primary school) to discuss the translation of the TLP, as well as it’s deeper philosophical impacts, himself describing individuals such as Albert Einstein (German theoretical physicist; 1879-1955), Sigmund Freud (Austrian neurologist/psychoanalytic scientist; 1856-1939) & Wittgenstein as “foes of civilisation” with great bearings upon the world (BBC Horizon, 1989). Upon arrival at Wittgenstein’s home, he felt surprised by the economic simplicity of his house, yet was un-surprised by how most of his teacher colleagues “regarded (him) as a little mad” (Frank Ramsey, 1923). Spending between 4 & 5 hours each day discussing the book, within the first 2 days, they had fully discussed merely the first 7 pages. Though Wittgenstein said he sought to no longer develop his philosophy as a consequence of his mind no longer being flexible for such activities (seeing 5-10 years as peaking in philosophical strain, having taken him 7 years to write the TLP), he allowed Ramsey to be the person to expand upon his prior scaffolds.\n\n“I ought to have done something positive with my life, to have become a star in the sky, instead I remain stuck on Earth and am now gradually fading out” (Garvey & Stangroom, 2012).\n\nExpellation from Teaching – The Haidbauer Incident\n\nMoving from school-to-school, Wittgenstein sought no aid from his family, and refused all persuasion from family & friends, Frank Ramsey wrote to John Keynes (British economist; 1883-1946) saying; “(his family) are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid’s food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren’t on good terms but because he won’t have any money he hasn’t earned … It is an awful pity” (Monk, 1990).\n\nMoving schools yet again in 1924 to Otterhal, Wittgenstein wrote a 42-page pronunciation & spelling dictionary for the children, the Wörterbuch für Volksschulen (“Dictionary for Elementary Schools“, later published in Vienna, 1926). However, during his time there, an incident occurred later known as Der Vorfall Haidbauer (“The Haidbauer Incident“, in April of 1926) regarding the extreme physical abuse of a student, Josef Haidbauer, who showed great difficulty in Wittgenstein’s classes & was punished to an extent which caused him to physically collapse – Ludwig immediately carried the boy to the head-teacher’s office, before hastily making his way outside. Herr Pirbauer, the father of another student (Hermine Pirbauer), claimed when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day; “I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn’t a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!” (Monk, 1990). Despite Pirbauer’s attempts to have Wittgenstein arrested both on the day of incident & the following day (where it was found Ludwig was absent from his home), police action remained unnecessary. On the 28th April 1926, Ludwig handed his resignation into a local school inspector, adamant that his days as a school-teacher were concluded – though conflicting reports dictate how the trial proceedings were settled, it is believed that the great wealth of Wittgenstein’s family aided in keeping the situation from most essences of public limelight.\n\nEventually, in 1926, the overall issues between Wittgenstein & local parents and authorities led him to permanently leave teaching, and temporarily return to Vienna to yet again avoid a return to the philosophy (which he deemed as the “intellectual squalor” – Dr. Michael Tanner (English author/lecturer in philosophy, 1989) of Cambridge (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nThe ‘Vienna Circle‘\n\nAround this period of time, the TLP was beginning to become a major area of debate amongst philosophers/scientists/mathematicians within the Weiner Kreis (‘Vienna Circle‘), an organisation operating at the University of Vienna from 1924-1936, headed by Moritz Schlick (German philosopher/positivist; 1882-1936), the founder of logical positivism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2016). Though they shared discussions in philosophy in 1926, Wittgenstein was never an official member of the organisation; “Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle’s thought was at least as important as that of any of it’s members” (Hanfling, 1981).\n\nEventually, differences in philosophical view-point led Wittgenstein to distance from the group intellectually – despite many members drawing influence from Ludwig’s ideology when originally forming the organisation. He also displayed continual rudeness when the group misunderstood or misread his works, reciting poetry aloud to disturb the flow of conversation (Discover: Science for the Curious, 2012). In the autobiography of a further member, Rudolf Carnap (German philosopher; 1891-1970), who himself drew great influence from Wittgenstein, he compares Ludwig’s theory-verification as functioning more from the perspective of a creative artist than any form of scientist – “his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art of a divine revelation“; leading to a methodological bridge between their ideologies (Carnap, 1963).\n\nHaus Wittgenstein\n\nReturning to his work as a gardener in a monastery in Hütteldorf , Ludwig temporarily showed interest in becoming a monk, likely as a consequence of his experiences from WW1 as well as his attachment to Tolstoy’s Gospel (despite being renowned for replying “Nonsense!” whenever a local priest answered questions whilst teaching in Trattenbach; Monk, 1990). Margarethe Stonborough-Wittgenstein invited Ludwig to help with the design of Haus Wittgenstein, which he entirely devoted himself to work on between 1926 & 1929. Utilising himself, Paul Engelmann (famous Viennes architect, who was originally commissioned in November of the prior year to design the plans for the house, 1891-1965), & a team of architects.\n\nAs expected, Ludwig fully dominated the project, stating “I am not interested in erecting a building, but in … presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings” (Hyde, 2008). The distinctive beauty & ingenious technicality of the house fell to Ludwig, who was described by his sister as constructing the the most minor details “with as much care and as much attention to detail as if they were precision instruments, and on a most elegant scale” (BBC Horizon, 1989). To the highest extent, meticulous & precise nature was utilised in the creation of everything from door handles & locks, to window & door frames; even utilising a pulley system which he himself designed to deliver heavy materials to the higher floors (BBC Horizon, 1989). When asked by an unidentified locksmith who was operating on the project; “tell me Herr engineer, does a millimetre here or there really matter so much to you?“, to which Ludwig bellowed in response, “Yes!“, as was fitting with his characteristically serious & abrupt demeanour (BBC Horizon, 1989). The only thing of no importance to Wittgenstein when constructing the building were the matters of money & time, as he had plenty of both (Margarethe Stonborough-Wittgenstein, 1927; BBC Horizon, 1989) – finishing construction in December of 1928, his sister, Hermine Wittgenstein, wrote “even though I admired the house very much … it seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling of the Gods” (Hyde, 2008).\n\nUpon the conclusion of the project, Ludwig temporarily returned to Norway, until he soon experienced his vocation to return to his philosophical routes in Cambridge, and finally returned to Trinity College (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nReturn to Cambridge\n\nHerbert Feigl (Austrian philosopher/Vienna Circle; 1902-1998) claimed that, upon his attendance of a conference by Luitzen E.J. Brouwer (Dutch mathematician/philosopher; 1881-1996) related to mathematics, Wittgenstein took into consideration a return to the philosophical world. As a result of motivation from Russell/Ramsey, he returned to Cambridge in 1929 – Keynes writing in a letter to his wife; “Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5. 15 train” (Monk, 1990).\n\nDue to his initial lack of a Ph.D, Ludwig remained incapable of working at Cambridge – thus, he applied for an advanced undergraduate degree, and utilised his prior residence before WW1 as eligibility for the requirements of the qualification. Offering the TLP as his thesis, it was examined in 1929 by Russell & Moore, to which he said to them; “don’t worry, I know you’ll never understand it“, followed by a confident slap of their shoulders (Monk, 1990) – despite his cockiness, Moore wrote in the report; “I myself consider this a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D degree” (Braithwaite, 1970). Following this success, Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1929 – having earned his Ph.D.\n\nFrancis Skinner & the ‘Pink/Yellow Book’\n\nA further romantic interest in Ludwig’s life, Francis Skinner (English mathematician; 1912-1941), met Ludwig in 1930 at Cambridge; a strong proprietor of mathematics, the two became partners following Skinner’s obsessional eagerness to conform to and please the man he readily admired. As renowned by Norman Malcolm, it seemed Wittgenstein was only happy when reading detective stories written by Norbert Davis (American Crime-Fiction author; 1909-1949) – as well as attending the cinema with friends such as Skinner himself to watch western films, whereby he would sit in a position where the screen filled his entire view; in order to “free his mind of the philosophical questions which tormented him” (Norman Malcolm, 1989). Despite such socialising, the emotional propensity remained un-reciprocated to any notable extent during their relationship, as Ludwig’s depressive personality and moody demeanour led him to greatly distance from Francis in the late 1930’s (Monk, 1990). The two had previously dictated aspects of the Pink/Yellow Book, a long-lost relation to the famous Brown Book and Blue Book (named so due to the coloured cloth wrapped around them).\n\nWhile the Blue Book centred around notes taken on Ludwig’s lectures from 1933-35 (these being integral to Wittgenstein’s late philosophy); discussing linguistic analysis & language philosophy in unpublished contexts, the Brown Book (which reflects a change in Wittgenstein’s philosophy) remained an unpublished instance with only 3 cases being printed and given to Francis Skinner & Alice Ambrose (American philosopher/logician; 1906-2001; disciple of Wittgenstein’s teachings). These books were kept within the close circles of Wittgenstein’s teachings & beliefs, few original copies being printed & even fewer available today as a result of their close-knit availability – fortunately, compilations of such datum have been released to the public in more recent editions (Wittgenstein, 1958). It is said that the philosophy & logic expressed in these texts demonstrates it confidently as a transition point in Ludwig’ theology, moving towards that of the ‘Philosophical Investigations‘ text (later-philosophies) in belief.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pink/Yellow Book was posted to a friend of Skinner following his death from polio in 1941; as to which Wittgenstein was present by his death-bed in the Cambridge Hospital for Infectious Diseases (due to a diagnosis of acute anterior poliomyetis) (The Guardian, 2011). This was much similar to Wittgenstein’s dedication of the TLP to his former partner Pinsent. During their time together, Skinner was said to have become “utterly, uncritically, and almost obsessively devoted to Wittgenstein” (Monk, 1990), reflective of a passion which was only reciprocated through the minor expression techniques which Wittgenstein was renowned for.\n\nPhysical & Philosophical Isolation\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ludwig’s continual seeking of solace & isolation led to continual physical abstraction from the population, spending time in his near-hidden home in Norway (which he himself constructed), as well as removing himself from academic contexts as a result of his continual detest for academia, and his constant feeling of being misunderstood in theories as well as personality. This isolation was ever-present in his life, and was a consistent confliction towards his social interactions & capabilities with others. His friend, George Henrik Von Wright (Finnish philosopher; 1916-2003) described how “his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men” (Malcolm, 1981). No better summarised than by himself, a journal entry in 1915 summated his issues; “my difficulty is only an – enormous – difficulty of expression” (WikiQuote, 2019). During the time-period of 1936-1937, Wittgenstein lived in Norway, where he worked on the PI, requiring complete social isolation for such.\n\nReturn to Otterhal\n\nIn 1936, 10 years following the original Haidbauer Incident, Ludwig returned to the village where the event occurred in part of a series of ‘confessions’ he made that year (including his admittance to minor infractions & white lies to past friends); personally apologising to at least 4 of the children who he had physically abused during his time as a school-teacher. Most former students were hospitable to the apologies, with Ray Monk (British philosopher; 1957-/; 1990) claiming that these confessions were not “to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; (but) it was to dismantle it – to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought” – Wittgenstein himself claiming the helpfulness of such apologies for bringing him into “more settled waters” upon the conclusion of his visit (1936) (Monk, 1990).\n\nMaurice O’Connor Drury & Psychiatry\n\nIn 1938, Ludwig travelled to Ireland to visit a friend known as Maurice O’Connor Drury (British psychiatrist; 1907-1976), with whom he discussed the concept of psychiatry, Maurice’s eventual speciaalisation. Wittgenstein began to consider this field himself, creating a potential to abandon philosophy entirely & utilise his intellectual capabilities for the betterment of mankind on a more pragmatic than theoretical level. Interestingly, the more linguistically therapeutic nature of the eventually published PI may be reflective of this more empathetic consideration which was instilled by Maurice.\n\nA Loss of Home; Adolf Hitler & Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nWhile staying at Maurice’s, Ludwig was legally defined as a Jewish citizen of the enlarged Germany (after the Nazi annexing of Austria in 1938) under the 1935 Nuremburg Racial Laws. Though he was fortunately in Ireland at the time, the same cannot be said for his brother, Paul Wittgenstein (concert pianist), who was forced to flee Vienna for fear of persecution due to his engagement with a non-Jewish citizen (Rassenschande; racial defilement). In tandem with this, his sister, Margarethe Stonborough-Wittgenstein warned Ludwig not to return to Vienna as a consequence of the Austrian Anschluss, advising him to apply for British citizenship as an alternative. She wrote a letter referring to how a large amount of their estate had been destroyed from heavy fighting, and part of it converted into a Nazi German HeadQuarters – when referring to the destruction of a large amount of family artefacts, she said “it would no longer mean anything, for all things have lost their value in this terrible time of war, and one can only be concerned about the fate of mankind“(BBC Horizon, 1989). Fortunately, he and his family were eventually granted ‘mischling‘ status (a combination of Aryan-Jewish legacy) personally by Adolf Hitler (German politician/Nazi leader; 1889-1945) in 1939 (only a few days before the outbreak of WW2), being one of 12 families given this supposed ‘privilege’ which abstained them from impeachment – this occurring due to the great financial influence which the family was renowned for. Furthermore, there is even rumour to Hitler and Wittgenstein having been fellow students during primary-school education at Realschule between 1904-1905 (with the individual Jew which Hitler discusses a pure hatred of during education, actually having been Ludwig), though this remains greatly-unverified due to presumptions & a lack of evidence (Waugh, 2008). Despite such, the only credit to this claim I will give is their confirmed presence at the school during the same time-period, as well as a photograph which supposedly (though remains unconfirmed) to show their mutual presence in the classroom – though there is no empirical evidence beyond such of their meeting or supposed reciprocal hatred (Monk, 1990).\n\nProfessorship in Philosophy\n\nFollowing the resignation of G.E. Moore from philosophy at Trinity College in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected to take his place – acquiring British citizenship in association. The ‘lectures’ as Wittgenstein referred to them were seen as highly active & intellectually intense sessions. Dr. Theodore Redpath (English scholar; 1913-1997), a former student of such discussions, remarks how Ludwig saw his sessions as the functioning of a masseur, whereby he could only help people with forms of mental cramp & stagnation, and do naught else for those who didn’t face this problem (BBC Horizon, 1989). These were seen as rather frightening sessions, whereby Ludwig would engage in his class occasionally to query their perspective on what he was discussing or how to solve a philosophical problem; should the response not be helpful, he would thrust his arms in a motion of denouncement towards the individual; this being noted in the manner of how “sometimes he encouraged you, and sometimes he didn’t” (Dr. Theodore Redpath, 1989).\n\nNorman Malcolm (at the time a post-graduate student) described his experience of these lectures as instance in which “one knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect … Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes” (Malcolm, 1981). Concurrently, Wittgenstein’s view on the foundations of mathematics began to change, no longer seeing the concept of mathematical facts as solid & discoverable (this being documented in the Blue Book, 1933-1935) – but constructed. Essentially, all philosophical viewpoints lie beyond linguistic display, and thus all mental comprehension; to analyse something and explain what cannot be explained, one is in fact supposed to only do so with worldly & observable constituents; making philosophy a procedure beyond the capability to be comprehended (BBC Horizon, 1989). The student with which he discussed such matters included Alan Turing (English logician/famous mathematician; 1912-1954), describing Ludwig as “a very peculiar man” (Hodges, 2014), and discussing many aspects of computational logic in association with notions of truth (Diamond, 1989).\n\nThe Second World War\n\nUnlike his direct involvement in WW1, Wittgenstein chose to refute infantry service in WW2, becoming a Hospital Porter at Guy’s Hospital in London (the same hospital where his associate, Frank P. Ramsey passed away from jaundice in 1930, following an abdominal operation) throughout the war – this is considered to be due to his intolerance towards conducting academic philosophy in a vital manner during times of war & turmoil (Monk, 1990). This was organised through him requesting John Ryle (English physician/epidemiologist; 1889-1950) for a manual labour job in the hospital, eventually meeting John’s wife & son in 1942, the son writing in his diary; “Wink is awfully strange – not a very good English speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘it’s tolerable’ meaning intolerable” (Monk, 1990). Despite his attempts at maintaining a low profile, many residents at the hospital recognised him, & he was permitted to dine at the Doctor’s table during luncheon hours. In this time, he developed a potentially romantic friendship with Keith Kirk, a friend of Francis Skinner before his untimely death – despite becoming extremely close, Keith abruptly became engaged & abandoned their association; “for ten days I’ve heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A tragic thought!” (Monk, 1990). During this time-period, he chose to also conduct medical research in Newcastle as a laboratory assistant from 1943-1944, rarely visiting Cambridge barring the occasional drop-in.\n\nFollowing the war, Wittgenstein only maintained contacts with two individuals; Ben Richards, & Roy Fouracre, expressing how his love for Richards aided in the quelling of emotional concerns, and his desire for Fouracre to safely return from war motivated him day-in-day-out (Monk, 1990). Following the expectation of returning to professorship upon the war’s conclusion, Ludwig displayed a pathological concern for his purity of thought, seeing Cambridge as an “intellectual squalor” of persons who discuss philosophical problems, but do not seek to solve them (Dr. Michael Tanner, 1989; BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nViolence of the Mind\n\nInfamy struck the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club in 1946, where on the 25th October at King’s College, Cambridge, an incident occurred between 3 of the most arguably important philosophers/logicians of the 20th century; Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, & Karl Popper (famous logical positivist, whose theory–falsification ideals now embody the modern deductive-scientific method; 1902-1994). It is said that during such a meeting, Popper surmised that rather than philosophical problems being mere linguistic trickery (as Wittgenstein proposed), they were real pragmatic issues – though accounts vary in what came henceforth, the incident concluded with Wittgenstein threatening Popper with a hot poker, demanding him to give an example of a moral rule. Upon Popper’s reply; “not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers” (Edmonds & Eidinow, 2001), Russell informed Wittgenstein he had misunderstood the premise of discussion, to which Wittgenstein then left. The minutes of the meeting refer to this event as “charged to an unusual degree with a spirit of controversy” (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2018). This occurrence was seen as reflective of Ludwig’s increased cynicism towards academia over time, and can be interpreted as part of his reasoning for resigning his professorship at Trinity College in Cambridge in 1947.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn his final years, Ludwig resigned his professorship at Cambridge (which he had maintained from 1939-1947) in order to focus on his philosophical & logical writings; though he showed difficulty in this upon a diagnosis of anaemia & inoperable prostrate cancer in 1949 which greatly affected his mind. Upon the diagnosis, he said “I was in no way shocked when I heard that I have cancer, but I was when I heard that one could do something about it, because I had no wish to live on; I couldn’t have my wish” (BBC Horizon, 1989). Following his resignation, Ludwig moved between the houses of those close to him; spending time in Vienna with Hermine Wittgenstein before her death in 1950 (“(a) great loss for me and all of us“; Malcolm, 1981), staying with G.H. Von Wright (later classified, along with E.A., his literary administrators), Rush Rhees (American philosopher; 1905-1989; later classified his executor), Elizabeth Anscombe (British analytic philosopher; 1919-2001; with whom he left notes that would eventually formulate the later-published ‘On Certainty‘; 1969), before going on holiday to Norway with Ben Richards.\n\nLudwig’s last few months were characterised by a decline in health and mental capabilities, writing to his close friend & colleague, Norman Malcolm (1911-1990), remarking; “my mind’s completely dead. This isn’t a complaint, for I don’t really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does” (Malcolm, 1981). Fortunately, he demonstrated his typical propensity and passion for philosophy only 13 days before his death (16th April, 1951), in a similar (but more optimistic) letter to Malcolm; “an extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been absolutely certain that I’d never again be able to do it. It’s the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up. – of course, so far I’ve only worked for about 5 weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now” (BBC Horizon, 1989). It is important to remark that, considering the immense emotional pressure and spirals of despair which Ludwig endured throughout his life, that the optimism which he scarce reflected should mean so much more in context.\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nAs his condition worsened, movement into the home of his doctor (Storey’s End, 76 Storey’s Way, Cambridge – where a plaque currently resides commemorating the talents of Wittgenstein), Edward Bevan (1907-1988) & his wife, Joan Bevan (1916-2008, a renowned artist) became an absolute. Though this request seemed contrary to his isolationist behaviours, his wanting to die outside of the confines of a hospital remained the most prominent reason. Despite originally finding him to be an intimidating individual, Joan eventually befriended Ludwig, and was even one of the final attendants by his side upon his death – this was mainly due to original issues they faced in how Joan disliked Ludwig’s seemingly rude & moody behaviours, eating breakfast alone and refuting all social contact (“he seemed oblivious as though he was simply walking through us“), even describing him to guests as simply “the man in the corner” (Joan Bevan, 1989; BBC Horizon, 1989). In this time, he sent his final-goodbye letters to his family members, ending the letters; “give my love to everybody, affectionately – Ludwig” (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nReadily approaching the estimated time of passing, he informed Joan; “tell them I’ve had a wonderful life” (described by Norman Malcolm as a “ … strangely moving utterance“). Shortly before he was pronounced dead, his bed-side was attended by 4 of his former students; Ben Richards, Yorick Smythies (philosophy student; 1917-1980), Maurice O’Connor Drury & Elizabeth Anscombe, and at Smythies’ request, a Dominican Friar; Father Conrad Pepler (English priest/lecturer; 1908-1993). Though they originally were concerned for the religious presence surrounding Ludwig’s passing, his Catholic friends recalled his asking of praying for him by pre-request, and so continued until he was pronounced as passed, and beyond (Monk, 1990).\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, one of the most influential & philosophically-unique individuals of the 20th century, died on the 28th April, 1951. Given a Catholic Burial at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, Wittgenstein is renowned to have never been a devout Catholic, but rather a sympathiser in the way of holding personal beliefs congruent with those of a Catholic; though not beheld to being a member of the system-organised religious faith (Malcolm & Winch, 1994). The British Wittgenstein Society (2007-/) seeks to uphold and value the philosophies of Wittgenstein in improving modern society under it’s creative & logically fertile foundations. In tandem, his last remaining brother, Paul Wittgenstein, continued the lineage of the Wittgenstein family with two children, one a daughter (Elizabeth Wittgenstein; 1935-1974), and the other as of yet unspecified (Geni, 2017).\n\nPhilosophy & Logic\n\nMost manuscripts related to the theorems of Wittgenstein were published posthumously (or still-yet remain undiscovered), consisting of a plethora of unpublished documentation under the title of Philosophical Investigations (1953), which detailed an understanding of the philosophies of the mind, psychology, mathematics & semantics. His only official publications were the “finely-honed” (Garvey & Stangroom, 2012) 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921; discussing the philosophy of mathematics, mind & language, in dedication to David Pinsent; 1922, anglicised), consisting of declarative statements related to the association of language with surrounding reality and thought – in tandem with articles, book reviews, & a 42-page children’s dictionary. He was described by his tutor, Bertrand Russell (analytic philosopher; 1872-1970), as “the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, & dominating” (Monk, 1990) – relating to his constant drive and logical personality, describing philosophical linguistics as “the only work that gives me real satisfaction” (WikiQuote, 2018).\n\nIn his understanding of language, Wittgenstein tended to compare it to the functioning of a tool-chest, containing “a hammer, chisel, matches, nails, screws, glue“, though important in the difference of these tools, they are utilised in combination for our formulation of speech & literary pursuit – the unique nature of individual words lying in their contextual application & generativity in meaning (Barrett, 2007). He interpreted language in many forms, claiming (as sampled from notes by Rush Rhees during lectures; 1938) that “when you see trees swaying about they are talking to one another“, with language occurring not from words, but from contexts of occurrence. This same contextual association is what encompassed his ‘language-games‘, whereby individuals are said to continually spar on a lingual field whereby discussions may hold a background of the conversers not entirely understanding the subjective terminologies of the person they are talking to.\n\nThough many outside of his philosophical discipline interpreted Wittgenstein’s philosophy as potentially dangerous, and the destructive dismantling of what he referred to as widely believed ‘houses of cards‘ (BBC Horizon, 1989), he deemed the dissolution of such as a sad but necessary step in creating new and more accurate, complex, intellectual monuments – even having said during his professorship at Cambridge; “I destroy, I destroy, I destroy” (BBC Horizon, 1989).\n\nIn defiance of most prior philosophers, Ludwig interpreted older philosophies as simply trying to discuss what cannot be discussed; aspects such as life, God, beauty & behaviour all lie beyond our capabilities of lingual explanation. To shadow how important such a claim was during this time-period, an understanding of aesthetics & spiritual constructs entirely befall a vital aspect of daily life – 18th/19th century philosophy centring around the essential nature of these ideas. To quote the 18th century fiction, ‘The Vicar of Wakefield‘ (Oliver Goldsmith, Irish novelist/playwright; 1728-1774; 1766); “We were generally awaked in the morning by music, and on fine days rode a-hunting. The hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study: they usually read a page, and then gazed at themselves in the glass, which even philosophers might own often presented the page of greatest beauty” – as well as “the eye was agreeably relieved” (Cassell’s National Library Edition, 1904, pg. 16; pg. 27). The appreciation of these values was characterised within aristocratic fields of appraisal, the book itself emphasising the importance of the futurely ordered hierarchy of needs (Abraham Maslow, American psychologist; 1908-1970; 1943) and how – once needs of survival were sated – needs of creative exploration, intimate relationships, self-actualisation & spiritual attainment dominated thresholds of desire. Wittgensteinian philosophy sought to undermine the validity of these un-observable constituents in their linguistic presentation; thus taking a near-revolutionary stance in essentially claiming all prior apparitions on a metaphysical base have never (and will never) be accurately envisioned.\n\nThis created the fundamental belief that everything which mattered most in the world could not be said, with natural science being distinguished from such in comparison to how we can directly observe it. To deconstruct a theory, one must understand how it has been created through language (Dr. Michael Tanner, 1989) – known as “linguistic confusions” (Garvey & Stangroom, 2012).\n\nWhen originally formulating theories with the help of Russell, Wittgenstein theorised that logic in and of itself must differ from all other sciences, whereby he began to formulate a paradigm of how philosophy should operate to understand such a concept through his investigation of Russell & Alfred North Whitehead‘s (English mathematician; 1861-1947) book, Principia Mathematica (‘Principles of Mathematics‘; 1910-1913). He began to trace problems down to their atomistic propositions, but as expected, he frequently changed his mind & began to see all qualities & relations as undeniably copular (BBC Horizon, 1989). Russell described “getting to know Wittgenstein (w)as one of the greatest intellectual adventures of my life“, claiming “his avalanches make mine seem mere snowballs” (Monk, 1990). His method of theory construction is interpreted as falling under that of inductive reasoning (gathering information to then form a hypothesis – the basis of early 20th century scientific thinking), a process of continual despair & agitated silence in the eyes of his colleagues.\n\nA more comprehensive file on the writings of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Philosophical Investigations & On Certainty – amongst other texts related to Wittgenstein; are detailed in their respective posts. There is even an expansive nachlass left behind by Wittgenstein; consisting of 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts & 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 unpublished pages – all of which are available via images on the University of Bergen website. These include Philosophical Remarks, Philosophical Grammar, Remarks on Colour, & the eventually published On Certainty (1969) which regarded his philosophical scepticism towards the epistemological themes of propositions.\n\n“it’s extraordinary isn’t it, what a huge and infinitely strange science logic is” – n.d, letter from Wittgenstein to Russell, sent from his home in Norway.\n\n“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing” – (Platonic Account of) Socrates\n\nInterestingly, regarding his thematics & ideologies, Ludwig consistently denied his prior and even recent teachings as including “grave mistakes” which he himself (along with the aid of Frank P. Ramsey from 1928-1930) identified upon closer inspection, even viewing the TLP as useful only as philosophical support rather than teaching – much like, how he refers to it in the final lines of the book; “my propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognises them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it). He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent” (TLP 6.54, 2nd Edition, 1933).\n\nHis obituary in The Times (2nd May, 1951) even refers to the same distaste for his own philosophy; “Dr. Ludwig Wittgenstein, who died in his sixty second year on Sunday at Cambridge, was a philosopher with a reputation as an intellectual innovator on the highest level. His earlier and later work formed the points of origin of two schools of philosophy, both of which he himself disowned“. This critical perspective led him to perceive his discussions as the scaffolding to aid future philosophers in truly understanding language & logic, reflecting such an important lesson in this same discussion being prevalent in his lecturers when he was a Professor at Trinity College in Cambridge.\n\nWhen referring to his final 15-20 years of philosophy, he claimed there is just as much potential use from the TLP & PI as “it is nevertheless possible that all I am going to produce will be flat, uninspired, and uninteresting” (BBC Horizon, 1989). Evidently, as shown in the plethora of investigation and conversion which still happens surrounding his theories, Ludwig was incorrect in this respect.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nAs a factor of paying respect to one of the most renowned & complicated philosophers of all time, I will not attempt to, myself, further analyse or understand the deeper philosophical and logic-based theologies surrounding this individual (as I would likely be butchering his deeper theology!); instead, I implore you personally sample an understanding and appreciation for his perspective via the large array of links & samples detailed in the below APA reference list, as well as further aspects of his many experiences & worldly influences beyond that from which I have discussed.\n\nI hope you find this brief summary of the life, & logic (which remains further detailed in the alternative documents), surrounding Wittgenstein helpful as a form of philosophical denouement.
