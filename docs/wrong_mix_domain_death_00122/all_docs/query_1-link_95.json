        "text": "Chiara Palazzolo (1961-2012) is best known for fantasy literature, especially a Gothic trilogy based on Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg’s innovative readings of the Roman Inquistion trials. In his Night Battles (I benandanti) Ginzburg argued that a group of 16th century Friulian peasants prosecuted for heresy were survivors of pre-Christian shamanistic cults at odds with the established church. Palazzolo adapted Ginsburg’s heretics and his band of benandanti (“good travelers”) to contemporary adolescent society in her trilogy, volume one, Non Mi Uccidere (Don’t Kill Me, from which the extract was taken). and sequels Strappami il cuore and Ti porterò nel sangue.\n\nAfter nineteen year old Mirta dies of an overdose along with her boyfriend Robin, she awakes to learn she is one of the “undead,” following long conversations with the ghost of Ludwig Wittgenstein. She and her fellow undead are pursued by a organization called the Benandanti, determined to hunt them down and drive them out because they eat the flesh of the living to survive. Eventually she will betray her lover Sara and the other undead in order to gain her freedom. Set in Perugia, Matera, the Salento and elsewhere in provincial Italy, the novels contrast a bien pensant society with the dark impulses beneath its surface. A Gothic coming of age tale about a callow young woman in an indifferent and insipid contemporary world who must endure many trials to learn to think for herself.\n\nPalazzolo was born in Floridia (Siracusa), Sicily, and after enrolling in university in Rome, lived in the capital. Her first two novels, not genre works, met with critical and popular success. After the trilogy, she published one more novel, Nel bosco di Aus, about witchcraft, before her untimely death in 2012.\n\nAn extract from Don’t Kill Me, in my translation, appears in the recently published Italian Literature in Translation, Volume III: Women, L. Lipperini, ed., Italian Cultural Institute in London. 2020, pp 156-195.\n\nLuminous flashes from a childhood fractured by the 1992-93 war in Abkhazia. Written with great artistry in Georgian-born Ruska Jorjoliani’s adopted language of Italian. A joy to translate.\n\nIn the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, seven-year-old Ruska Jorjoliani and her family fled the Abkhazia region of Georgia, then in the grip of war and ethnic cleansing that cost the lives of as many as 30,000 Georgians. From her birthplace of Mestia in the Causcasus, they became refugees in Tbilisi in 1992. The following summer Ruska and other children caught up in that conflict were sent to stay with Italian families, a humanitarian project to provide them with temporary safety, adequate nutrition and something like normality. That first summer Jorjoliani began to master Italian. Since 2007 she has lived in her adoptive city of Palermo, where she is pursuing a second university degree in philosophy. But her command of the language is not merely good, she’s an accomplished writer in Italian with a haunting, musical style. The author of stories and a novel, she’s considered a promising young talent in the language.\n\nRead “Fragments”\n\nThe story “Pitch Dark”, published in the FLR issue 4, autumn 2018 was written during Ruska Jorjoliani’s writer’s residency in San Gimignano and reflects an imaginative connection between that medieval Tuscan city and the border villages of her native Georgia, with their similar stone towers. It’s a somewhat enigmatic tale about a father and son, tyranny and resistance. The style is compressed in cryptic observations and unexpected metaphors, so that a reader must pause and reflect to absorb all that she’s saying. Those qualities– extreme compression and a pacing that can resemble a musical line, with invitations to pause and think– are challenges for a translator accustomed to the frankness, simplicity and rapid-fire narrative style of so much contemporary writing. Finding a voice for Ruska Jorjoliani also meant giving some thought to the register (slightly formal, no contemporary vernacular will do) and the structure of the sentences, which as she has noted, borrow somewhat from her native Georgian.\n\nIn Italian, she has written short stories and a novel that takes place over a century beginning in revolutionary Russia, La tua presenza è come una città (titled, in the German edition, “You, in the Skies with Me”, 2015). The novel garnered critical acclaim and a special mention for the Hermann Geiger prize in 2016, as well as Best Book at Librinfestival 2018. The German translation of her novel, from the Swiss press Rotpunkverlag, was named one of the ten best books of the year among titles published by the German language independent press.\n\nRead “Pitch Dark”"
