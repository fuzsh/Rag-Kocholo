        "text": "Profession: Philosopher\n\nBiography: Ludwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian philosopher best known for his early work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, and his later work which was only published posthumously, titled Philosophical Investigations. These two works are often seen as existing in a state of tension, with the latter contradicting the former.\n\nWittgenstein was born to a wealthy Austrian family, one of the richest families in Europe, and inherited a fortune from his father. He was generous with his wealth and ultimately gave it all away to his brothers and sisters. Three of his four older brothers would die by suicide, while Wittgenstein himself often suffered from depressive episodes.\n\nDuring World War I, Wittgenstein served on the front lines and was decorated several times for courage. He started out as an engineer and had a tumultuous career even once he made it to philosophy, variously spending time as a school teacher in the Austrian alps and a hospital porter in London during World War II.\n\nWittgenstein set out on his philosophical career after coming to Cambridge where he met with Bertrand Russell. He wrote his first work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, while he was in a prisoner of war camp during World War I, and this would serve as his thesis for his PhD from Cambridge.\n\nLater in life, Wittgenstein returned to philosophy where he sought to make up for lost time and prepare a final manuscript. He taught philosophy during this period and worked on what would eventually become the Philosophical Investigations. This work, as his first, was concerned with the philosophy of language.\n\nThe basic trend of Wittgenstein's thought throughout was that an understanding of language was necessarily prior to any further philosophy. This was treated categorically in his first work, that certain things simply could not be spoken of, that to do so was inevitably nonsensical, whereas his latter work has been read as seeming to relax this somewhat.\n\nBorn: April 26, 1889\n\nBirthplace: Vienna, Austria-Hungary\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
