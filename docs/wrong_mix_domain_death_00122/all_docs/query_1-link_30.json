        "text": "From my list on 1980s punk and politics.\n\nBy Kevin Mattson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was a participant in the D.C. punk scene during the 1980s and helped start an organization known as Positive Force. I remember hearing about the group “Parents of Punkers,” the head of which compared punk to a violent cult. They would go on television and scare watchers about what their kids might be doing. I remember at the time that this missed the realities of my own experiences and made me want to protest this moral panic. But I knew this required some distance from the “punk rock world” I had inhabited. I kept thinking about writing this book and the timing was right.\n\nKevin's book list on 1980s punk and politics\n\nWhy did Kevin love this book?\n\nFrom Martin’s expansive look at things, let’s move onto a more granular approach – Fournier’s Double Nickels. Fournier focuses on just one band and an album (albeit a double record album and one of the best to come out of punk in the 1980s). The Minutemen played a fast, discordant music that sounded like jazz as much as hardcore thrash music. Fournier’s examination turns up something few people consider, that punk wasn’t all about blistering music but rather sophisticated in its nature. Fournier documents how the bassist in the band, Mike Watt, had extended conversations with one of the most important artists associated with 1980s punk – Raymond Pettibon (who as of now has made his way into accomplished art museums and galleries). They talked about everything from Ludwig Wittgenstein to James Joyce. Band members supposedly got into heated debates about history and would stop at public libraries while…\n\nBy Michael T. Fournier,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn recent years, the Minutemen have enjoyed something of a revival, due to both a chapter in Michael Azerrad's book \"Our Band Could Be Your Life\", and a feature length documentary film, \"We Jam Econo\", showcasing the band's legacy. (And having a song serve as the theme for MTV's \"Jackass\" show doesn't hurt, either.) To date, though, the band's actual work hasn't been the subject of much attention - everything has focused on either the interpersonal relationships that made the Minutemen so distinctive or the sudden and tragic death of guitarist/singer D. Boon. This book shines a light on the…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on exploring strange features of science.\n\nBy Angela Potochnik Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a philosopher before I knew what philosophers were: asking questions to challenge the starting points for conversations. My biggest pet peeve has always been people who were sure they entirely understood something. While scientists conduct science to help learn about the world, philosophers of science like me study science to try to figure out how it works, why (and when) it’s successful, and how it relates to human concerns and society. Humans ultimately invent science, and I think it’s fascinating to consider how its features relate to our interests and foibles and how it’s so successful at producing knowledge and practical abilities.\n\nAngela's book list on exploring strange features of science\n\nWhy did Angela love this book?\n\nThe Vienna Circle was a group of polymaths—primarily scientists and philosophers—who held weekly meetings in Vienna between the World Wars. This book is by far the best retelling of their story, and it’s fascinating.\n\nWhile their names aren’t well known, their work had tremendous influence. They prominently shaped the reception and understanding of Einstein’s new theories of relativity, began the use of simple images to communicate information without words, and introduced logical developments that eventually led to computers and other technology.\n\nBy David Edmonds,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Murder of Professor Schlick as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the author of Wittgenstein's Poker and Would You Kill the Fat Man?, the story of an extraordinary group of philosophers during a dark chapter in Europe's history\n\nOn June 22, 1936, the philosopher Moritz Schlick was on his way to deliver a lecture at the University of Vienna when Johann Nelboeck, a deranged former student of Schlick's, shot him dead on the university steps. Some Austrian newspapers defended the madman, while Nelboeck himself argued in court that his onetime teacher had promoted a treacherous Jewish philosophy. David Edmonds traces the rise and fall of the Vienna Circle-an influential group…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on love, loss, and logic in 1930s Vienna.\n\nBy Kirsten Menger-Anderson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI first learned about life in 1930s Vienna from my grandfather’s memoir: Reminiscences of the Vienna Circle and the Mathematical Colloquium. I was fascinated by the time and place and began to read more about the era, which ultimately served as a setting for my forthcoming novel, The Expert of Subtle Revisions.\n\nKirsten's book list on love, loss, and logic in 1930s Vienna\n\nWhy did Kirsten love this book?\n\nIn the mood for a graphic novel starring Bertrand Russell and a supporting cast of famous thinkers like Whitehead, Frege, Gödel, and Wittgenstein? Logicomix is for you!\n\nFlip to Chapter Six, “Incompleteness,” for a peek of Vienna in the 1930s. The logic and philosophy illustrated throughout provide a great context for the work of Vienna’s famous philosophical circle led by Moritz Schlick, whose 1936 murder provides a chilling contrast to the intellectual pursuits of that time.\n\nBy Apostolos Doxiadis, Christos Papadimitriou,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Logicomix as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis brilliantly illustrated tale of reason, insanity, love and truth recounts the story of Bertrand Russell's life. Raised by his paternal grandparents, young Russell was never told the whereabouts of his parents. Driven by a desire for knowledge of his own history, he attempted to force the world to yield to his yearnings: for truth, clarity and resolve. As he grew older, and increasingly sophisticated as a philosopher and mathematician, Russell strove to create an objective language with which to describe the world - one free of the biases and slippages of the written word. At the same time, he…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on biographies of physicists.\n\nBy Andrew Zangwill Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a physics professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Ten years ago, I switched my research focus from solid-state physics to the history of that subject. This was fertile ground because professional historians of science had almost completely ignored solid-state physics. I began my new career by writing two journal articles about the physicist Walter Kohn and his discovery of what became the most accurate method known to calculate the properties of solids. This experience led me to broaden my perspective and ultimately produce a biography of the theoretical physicist Philip Anderson. My next book will be a historical-sociological study of self-identity and disciplinary boundaries within the community of physicists.\n\nAndrew's book list on biographies of physicists\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nThe brilliant and enigmatic Robert Oppenheimer was the man who led the effort to create the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during World War II. I value this biography because author Ray Monk does full justice to his subject’s science—the science that put Oppenheimer’s Berkeley research group at the center of American theoretical physics in the 1930s. Best of all, Monk’s elegant writing makes even familiar episodes come alive. I felt I was watching a car crash in slow motion as I read how Oppenheimer’s complex personality and political naivete led him to underestimate his political enemies and wind up stripped of his security clearance and his influence as a government advisor.\n\nBy Ray Monk,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Robert Oppenheimer as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn unforgettable story of discovery and unimaginable destruction and a major biography of one of America’s most brilliant—and most divisive—scientists, Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center vividly illuminates the man who would go down in history as “the father of the atomic bomb.” Oppenheimer’s talent and drive secured him a place in the pantheon of great physicists and carried him to the laboratories where the secrets of the universe revealed themselves. But they also led him to contribute to the development of the deadliest weapon on earth, a discovery he soon came to fear. His attempts to resist the…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on reads when your job is ruining your life.\n\nBy Joanne B. Ciulla Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAt one point in my life, I took Ph.D. classes in the morning, taught philosophy in the afternoon, and tended bar at night. I was always working, and money was tight. Then, one day at a faculty meeting, my colleagues and I discussed developing an appealing new course. I suggested one on the philosophy of work and ended up teaching it and writing my dissertation on work and moral values. I loved teaching the class to the part-time students. They came to class straight from work and shared their experiences. Those students taught me more about work than any book in the library. Years later, I wrote The Working Life.\n\nJoanne's book list on reads when your job is ruining your life\n\nWhy did Joanne love this book?\n\nThis is a wise and witty philosophical reflection on the meaning of games and life. Suits asks: If we didn’t ever have to work again, would we have to replace work with things like the housebuilding game or the lawyer game? If so, would the game about work satisfy the need to work?\n\nBy Bernard Suits, Frank Newfeld (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Grasshopper as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. \"Nonsense,\" said the sensible Bernard Suits: \"playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.\" The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful. Through the jocular voice of Aesop's Grasshopper, a \"shiftless but thoughtful practitioner of applied entomology,\" Suits not only argues that games can be meaningfully defined; he also suggests that playing games is a central part of the ideal…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on biographies for the contemporary reader.\n\nBy Adrián Gordaliza Vega Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a graduate in Philosophy with a Masters degree in Contemporary Culture so this theme is enormously interesting for me. My passion has been shifting from literature to contemporary society and culture in general. I love to find the connexions between the current state of affairs and the past. I honestly think that if we look at the lives and times of the great thinkers we can get hints about the state of contemporary society. Understanding what makes us behave and think the way we do it is my main motivation.\n\nAdrián's book list on biographies for the contemporary reader\n\nWhy did Adrián love this book?\n\nThe figure of Ludwig Wittgenstein has always been quite enigmatic for me.\n\nThe enormous contradictions of his life and the intensity of it are difficult to understand in the abstract. Ray Monk's biography contextualizes the life and work of the Austrian philosopher who set out to solve all the problems of philosophy.\n\nMonk's biography stands as a testament to Wittgenstein's enduring influence on our understanding of language, thought, and reality.\n\nBy Ray Monk,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Ludwig Wittgenstein as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Great philosophical biographies can be counted on one hand. Monk's life of Wittgenstein is such a one.\" The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nPreview\n\nFrom Arshin's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Arshin Adib-Moghaddam Author\n\nWhy did Arshin love this book?\n\nI finally managed to read this book en route from Cambridge to London – my usual commute to the SOAS office, which has helped with reading the amount of books indicated above, especially during train strikes.\n\nOkay, the book is Eurocentric like most Western philosophy, and yes, it should have had more exposure to other ‘magicians’ of thought.\n\nBut in entertaining and repeatedly hilarious prose, Eilenberger teases out some extremely interesting anecdotes of some of the most prominent minds of human history: philosophers such as Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Ernst Cassirer who shaped almost everything that we know. Their knowledge appears in places that you and I never expected.\n\nBy Wolfram Eilenberger, Shaun Whiteside (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Time of the Magicians as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAN ECONOMIST, GUARDIAN AND NEW STATESMAN BOOK OF THE YEAR\n\nA gripping narrative of the intertwined lives of the four philosophers whose ideas reshaped the twentieth century\n\nThe year is 1919. Walter Benjamin flees his overbearing father to scrape a living as a critic. Ludwig Wittgenstein, scion of one of Europe's wealthiest families, signs away his inheritance, seeking spiritual clarity. Martin Heidegger renounces his faith and aligns his fortunes with Husserl's phenomenological school. Ernst Cassirer sketches a new schema of human culture on a cramped Berlin tram. The stage is set for a great intellectual drama. Over the next decade…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Marcia love this book?\n\nIn most introvert-theme fiction, not much “happens.” Instead, the author focuses on the texture of characters’ thoughts, experiences, and memories. I found this novel, by an Austrian writer not well known in the English-speaking world, fascinating for two reasons. First, it explores the life, work, and thinking process of an obsessive genius – someone introverted to the nth degree. And second, it does so in a book of just two paragraphs, going on and on in musical prose where the repetitive rhythms of the sentences have just as much impact as what they’re narrating. The architectural genius in Correction is partly based on Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, which added interest for me since I find Wittgenstein a uniquely inspiring figure.\n\nBy Thomas Bernhard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Correction as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe scientist Roithamer has dedicated the last six years of his life to “the Cone,” an edifice of mathematically exact construction that he has erected in the center of his family’s estate in honor of his beloved sister. Not long after its completion, he takes his own life. As an unnamed friend pieces together—literally, from thousands of slips of papers and one troubling manuscript—the puzzle of Rotheimer’s breakdown, what emerges is the story of a genius ceaselessly compelled to correct and refine his perceptions until the only logical conclusion is the negation of his own soul.\n\nConsidered by many critics…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Gary love this book?\n\nI first read this book at age twenty-one and have never stopped returning to it. It gets better and deeper each time.\n\nLudwig teaches that language and reality are bound up in so many ways. It also contains some famous themes and head-scratchers, such as language games, family resemblance, private language, and rule-following, discussed, as always, in a non-technical way.\n\nBy Ludwig Wittgenstein,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Philosophical Investigations as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIncorporating significant editorial changes from earlier editions, the fourth edition of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is the definitive en face German-English version of the most important work of 20th-century philosophy The extensively revised English translation incorporates many hundreds of changes to Anscombe's original translation Footnoted remarks in the earlier editions have now been relocated in the text What was previously referred to as 'Part 2' is now republished as Philosophy of Psychology - A Fragment , and all the remarks in it are numbered for ease of reference New detailed editorial endnotes explain decisions of translators and identify references and…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Kieran love this book?\n\nWittgenstein’s Mistress is a novel by David Markson that takes the form of a journal written by a woman living on a beach who believes she is the only person left on earth. It is made up of short paragraphs—often no more than a sentence—that record her lonely travels, like a surrealist Robinson Crusoe. At the risk of spoiling a conceptual twist, what begins as a metaphysical examination of language and the self turns out to be a study of grief and betrayal. If you are lonely, Wittgenstein’s Mistress is wonderful company: captivating, playful, intellectually rich, and unexpectedly moving.\n\nBy David Markson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Wittgenstein's Mistress as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWittgenstein's Mistress is a novel unlike anything David Markson or anyone else has ever written before. It is the story of a woman who is convinced and, astonishingly, will ultimately convince the reader as well that she is the only person left on earth.\n\nPresumably she is mad. And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as…\n\nPreview"
