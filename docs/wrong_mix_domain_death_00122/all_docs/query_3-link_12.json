        "text": "Wittgenstein’s Relevance Today\n\nWe as humans have a desire to turn to other humans’ deep thinking to seek orientation in our modern confusion. Every year, dedicated admirers make the pilgrimage to Norway solely to get a sense of why Wittgenstein kept returning to this remote cabin, which he placed on a steep mountainside overlooking the turquoise Eidevatnet lake. Wittgenstein wandered in these beautiful natural fjord and mountain landscapes to get clarity over his logical thinking. Now, people have made Wittgeinstein’s cabin a pilgrimage site to seek clarity of thought. It is said that Wittgenstein’s cognitive semantics research has served as a foundation for today’s artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, such as ChatGTP. That makes him more relevant than ever.\n\nSkjolden’s Impact on Wittgenstein's work\n\nWittgenstein's time in Norway also provided him with the space to challenge traditional philosophical notions. His insights into the nature of language and its relationship to the world led him to conclude that much of traditional philosophy was trapped in a web of language, unable to escape its own limitations. The culmination of his contemplations during this Norwegian retreat resulted in the publication of his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in 1921. In this influential treatise, Wittgenstein explored the logical structure of language and its capacity to accurately represent reality.\n\nToday, Up Norway travellers can visit Wittgenstein’s cabin and explore the same landscapes that sparked Wittgenstein's philosophical pursuits. With each tranquil fjord and awe-inspiring vista, you can't help imagining the deep thoughts that emerged from the mind of this great philosopher during his time here. Here, he came to understand that there are some experiences, like the majesty of this sublime untouched landscape, which are beyond language, impossible to put into words.\n\n‘Thanks to your prodigious efforts, we got to spend 8 hours with Harald Vatne. He not only spent hours with us at Wittgenstein's cottage, but also at his house, where Harald and his wife graciously served us waffles and coffee! Everything that you and your team organized for us was exquisite! You and your colleagues are artists in your own right.’\n\n- Up Norway Travelers Doug & Lindsay Stern"
