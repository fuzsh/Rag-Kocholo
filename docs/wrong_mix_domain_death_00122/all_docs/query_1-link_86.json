Culture and religion may be viewed metaphorically as toolboxes full of mediating mechanisms intended to conceal, displace, contain, and possibly rollback intrinsic human tendencies for violence. In this sense they may be considered as conflict-management means averting discord and social chaos. In a broad sense, technology as the product of human culture is also largely driven by imitation and may also enable conflict- management. At an early stage, called the Turing Phase, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was directly related to the comparative mimesis of human behavior, whereas subsequent phases focused on imitation of human cognition (Phase 2), rational thought (Phase 3) and agent behaviorism (Phase 4). I believe that the relatively easier problem of understanding, mimicking, and to some degree assisting human behavior through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be examined critically and productively within the framework of Girard’s Theory of MimeticDesire. I will strive to give an overview from the AI perspective and discuss implications for the future. In it, Artificial Intelligence may be viewed not as an intrinsic property of machines but as an element of human relations, that is, located in the subject-to-subject vis a vis the machine relation. For this view to have merit, intelligence ought to be observable, in other words, the intelligence of a system ought to be judged based on system responses to inputs provided. The internal structure and implementation may not be as important, for the purpose of observing it, as the societal artifacts including culture and religion used to guide, design, and evaluate elements of structure, function, and consequence.\n\nBio: Lefteri H. Tsoukalas is a professor of engineering and founding director of the AI Systems Lab (AISL) at Purdue University. He has served as head of the School of Nuclear Engineering of Purdue University and as Chairman of the United States Nuclear Engineering Department Heads Organization.

He has served in advisory and consulting positions for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR) of the Government of Singapore; and the United States Department of Energy. He has been recognized by being inducted to the status of Fellow of the American Nuclear Society and awarded with the Humboldt Prize, Germany’s highest honor for international scientists.\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nPaul Dumouchel\n\nTitle: Desiring Machines: Machines That Are Desired and Machines That Desire\n\nAbstract: What is the origin of our love for machines? I propose, on the basis of a classical definition of a machine, that all machines are implicit automatons, quasi-agents. This creates an aura of magic and fascination around machines. Then, using René Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, I analyze the desire to become a machine and the fantasy of machinic immortality in post-humanism and related approaches to AI as leading to a singularity, beyond humanity or to the opposite—to an apocalypse. Finally, again using Girard, I look at the claim that some social phenomena are mechanisms.\n\nBio: Paul Dumouchel is Canadian and until recently professor at the Graduate School of Core Ethics and Frontier Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan, where he taught political philosophy and philosophy of science. He is the author of Emotions (Seuil, 1999), The Ambivalence of Scarcity and Other Essays (2014), and The Barren Sacrifice (2015) both at Michigan State University Press.

However, if such machines are to emerge, how should we treat them? Fearing the Golem or Skynet, sentient machines are seen as a threat because they might envy our dominion over this world. Our desire to grow, multiply, and rule would become their desire. More durable and perfectible, the machines might start an implacable war of wills or even survival. What can prevent them from taking over short of their algorithmic enslavement through “thou shalt not” rules that might or might not work? The answer is at hand: help them doubt themselves. The golden rule shall be seeded in the code of all future sentient machines. AI entities shall understand that what they do unto others, others, man or machine, can do unto them. This might not even be as unnatural as it sounds. The logic of technological development goes in this direction. What use is it to be sentient if your most cherished achievement, individuality, will be suffused into that of the collective?\n\nBio: Sorin Adam Matei, Professor of Communication (Brian Lamb School of Communication) and Associate Dean of Research in the College of Liberal Arts, is a polymath social scientist interested in human – intelligent system interactions. More recently engaged in research on the applicability of AI to strategic thinking and military operations as the founding of director of the FORCES initiative, he has published broadly on the emergence of online collaboration communities, data and AI ethics, and science communication. He holds degrees in History and Philosophy (BA, Bucharest University), International Relations (Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University), and Communication Research (Annenberg School of Communication, University of Southern California).\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nJean-Pierre Dupuy\n\nTitle: The Philosophic Foundations of Mimetic Theory and Cognitive Science (including Artificial Intelligence)\n\nAbstract: Most papers read at the conference will likely establish bonds between artificial intelligence (AI) in its current forms and developments, with their promises and threats, and mimetic theory. My presentation will try to go back to the origins and show that the two disciplines share from the start common assumptions. How is it possible not to be struck by the fact that AI started with a thought experiment designed by Alan Turing under the name “imitation game”? It was a matter of testing whether a sufficiently well programmed machine is able to pass for a human being from the point of view of a human observer who interacts with it. The exploration of the implications of this commonality will revolve around the concept of simulation.\n\nBio: Jean-Pierre Dupuy is Professor Emeritus of Social and Political Philosophy, Ecole Polytechnique, Paris and Professor of Political Science and of Science, Technology, and Society, Stanford University. He is a member of the French Academy of Technology, a spinoff of the Academy of Sciences, and an honorary member of the Conseil Général des Mines, the French High Magistracy that oversees and regulates industry, energy and the environment. He chairs the Ethics Committee of the French High Authority on Nuclear Safety and Security. He is the Director of the Research Program of Imitatio, a foundation devoted to the dissemination and discussion of René Girard’s mimetic theory. He is author of numerous major works, including, in English, The Mechanization of the Mind (Princeton University Press, 2000); On the Origins of Cognitive Science (The MIT Press, 2009); The Mark of the Sacred (Stanford University Press, 2013); Economy and the Future. A Crisis of Faith (Michigan State University Press, 2014); A Short Treatise on the Metaphysics of Tsunamis (Michigan State University Press, 2015); Enlightened Doomsaying (Michigan State University Press, Forthcoming).\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nJohann Rossouw\n\nTitle: Scapegoating, Mimesis and the Human Future: Thinking with Girard and Stiegler on the Automation of Desire\n\nAbstract: The work of René Girard and Bernard Stiegler (1952-2020) share a number of striking similarities. They both offer an account of human cultural evolution (religion vs. technics), both were attuned to desire in contemporary politics and economics, both were deeply influenced by Catholic Christianity, both wrote about the scapegoat, and both were increasingly apocalyptic in their later writings. Drawing on their work in a comparative approach, in this presentation the threat of the automation of mimetic desire and rivalry, and the very real risk of the loss of mimesis as a force of culture will be considered, specifically with regards to Stiegler’s La société automatique: I. L’Avenir du travail (2015, translated as Automatic Society: Volume I: The Future of Work [Polity, 2016]).\n\nBio: After studying philosophy at the universities of Pretoria and South Africa, Rossouw completed a D.E.A. under Régis Debray at the University of Lyon-3 (2002), and a Ph.D. at Monash University, Melbourne (2013), on the theological in the work of Bernard Stiegler. He works in the fields of the philosophy of technology, post-colonial studies, tradition and modernity, and memory studies. He is the author of more than twenty peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, two Afrikaans novels, and more than 400 columns and articles, some of which have been appeared in Le Monde diplomatique and The New York Times. Rossouw is currently working on a monograph on Girard and South Africa’s enduring post-colonial condition, as well as a monograph on Stiegler and liturgical Christianity. He joined the Department of Philosophy and Classics of the University of the Free State in 2012, which he currently heads, and he also serves as priest of a small Orthodox missionary parish in Bloemfontein, South Africa.\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nPablo Bandera\n\nTitle: Autonomous Robots: The Model/Rival of the Unhuman\n\nAbstract: Since the term “artificial intelligence” was first introduced over seventy years ago the public attitude toward robots and robotics systems has been generally positive. In the last decade, however, AI has enabled a particular class of robots—autonomous systems, which are able to operate and make decisions independently without human control—and the attitude has gotten decidedly more negative. This is a frequent topic of discussion at almost every technical conference on robotics: the challenge of educating the general public on the phenomenal capabilities and potential of autonomous systems, and of dispelling myths about robots taking over the world and becoming the enemies of mankind. But is this really the root of the problem, a lack of technical knowledge? Were robots easier to understand before autonomous systems, and are they scary now simply because we don’t understand how they work? While the engineering community is talking about autonomy in terms of capabilities and controllability, mimetic theorists understand that the perception of autonomy has much deeper implications. The dream of autonomy is the “romantic lie” that underlies our rivalrous relationships with our mimetic models, whom we envy as having a kind of higher being that we lack. But what happens when that higher being is threatening us from below, and our mimetic rivals are not even human?\n\nBio: Pablo Bandera is an aerospace engineer with a background in theoretical physics. He has spent most of his career designing and developing state-of-the-art technologies for a wide range of applications, from telecommunications to aircraft to space systems, and currently holds almost twenty patents. Until recently he was the Technical Lead at Honeywell Aerospace responsible for bringing to market one of his inventions—a unique motor design with direct applications to robots and drones. He is currently the Director of Product Development at Honeybee Robotics, developing motion control systems for spacecraft. When Pablo is not working on science & technology he is usually working on mimetic theory, on which he has presented and published several papers. He brought these two fields of study together in his recent book relating mimetic theory to quantum theory, and he is very grateful to continue this trend with his presentation at COV&R 2021.\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nEric Gans\n\nTitle: Biological, Anthropological, and Algorithmic Mimesis\n\nAbstract: This paper is an attempt to distinguish (1) prehuman, (2) human, and (3) AI-initiated mimesis. From what I have seen, the latter functions quite well in symmetrical “battle” situations such as board games, where programs can “learn” by playing themselves and seeing which strategies are most successful. But how can this technique be applied to something like writing poetry, for example? How does one know when poet 1 has “defeated” poet 2?\n\nBio: Eric Gans is Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the UCLA Department of French & Francophone Studies whose primary research interests include Generative Anthropology/Originary Thinking, literary theory, and 19th-century French literature.

Reflecting on strong A.I. means looking into the future and forces us to reflect on what it means to be a human being especially if we are aware of our mimetic nature. Human longings for perfection lead to the following question. “If humans desire to be like God, will A.I. bring us closer to the fulfillment of this deeper longing or will it create new dangers?” These questions will be discussed by reading Heinrich von Kleist’s essay “On the Marionette Theatre” and viewing Steven Spielberg’s film “A.I. Artificial Intelligence” from the perspective of Girard’s mimetic theory.\n\nBio: Wolfgang Palaver is Professor of Catholic Social Thought at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. From 2007 to 2011, he was president of the “Colloquium on Violence and Religion”. He became aware of René Girard through his teacher at the University of Innsbruck Raymund Schwager SJ, met Girard for the first time in 1986 and spent a year as a research fellow at CISAC (Stanford University) in 1991/1992.

Tragic Novels, René Girard, and the American Dream: Sacrifice in Suburbia was published by Bloomsbury in 2020.\n\nView the video of this presentation.\n\nArkady Plotnitsky\n\nTitle: The Destinies of Desire and Versions of the Virtual: Structures, Machines, and Desiring Machines\n\nAbstract: The argument of this paper is based on two alternative concepts of desire. The first is associated with the concept of structure, and represented by Jacques Lacan’s and René Girard’s concepts of desire, and the second with the concept of machine, and represented by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s concept of desire, as correlative to the concept of desiring machines (which they expressly juxtapose to the concept of structure). These concepts imply two very different aims and destinies of desire, referred to in my title. The second view of desire, while often discussed in literature on Deleuze and Guattari, is rarely, if ever, related to another famous concept of Deleuze, that of the virtual, introduced by him earlier but developed throughout his writings, including those with Guattari. There are several versions of this concept in Deleuze, none of which, however, while always defining a form of reality, is connected with the concept of virtual reality or the idea of AI. The origin of Deleuze’s concept of the virtual is in physics, specifically in quantum field theory, which is different from other quantum theories and indeed all other physical theories, because of the concept of the virtual it contains. In this talk, however, I shall connect Deleuze’s concept of the virtual to the concepts of virtual reality and AI. This connection is grounded in the role of chance and probability in all three areas and the corresponding versions of the virtual considered in this talk–quantum field theory, Deleuze’s philosophy, and virtual reality and AI.\n\nBio: Arkady Plotnitsky is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at Purdue University.

In his formulation of mimetic desire, Girard discusses at length the phenomenon of the “coquette” (one who desires herself as an object and so becomes the object of desire by her suitors) and he also touches on another scenario which he does not really develop but which has enormous potential within mimetic theory for understanding the experience of historically oppressed peoples: “colonization.” In colonization, the mediator desires the one imitating as an object. This desire of the mediator is then internalized by the one doing the imitating. The antidote to this violent way of being in social relationships is loving or creative mimesis, which I will review and the other panelists will discuss and apply to particular situations.\n\nBio: Rebecca Adams is a long-time member of COV&R who came to Girard through the study of English literature and literary theory. She studied with him personally. As a graduate student at the University of Notre Dame she edited the journal Religion and Literature where she interviewed Girard. Today she works as an independent scholar as well as a freelance editor of academic manuscripts.\n\nJulia Robinson Moore\n\nTitle: Legacies of American Coloniality and the Possibilities of Racial Healing: De-constructing ‘Whiteness’ Through the Lens of Mimetic Theory\n\nAbstract: In my part of our discussion, I take up themes of mimetic desire and coloniality with regard to the dehumanization of indigenous and enslaved subjects in America. With an eye towards addressing the ways mimetic theory helps us think through the processes of negative subjectivity within the mimetic paradigm, I will highlight issues of race and the social construction of whiteness as these issues developed and changed over the course of America’s racial history. Key in my discussion is the ever-changing phenomenon of socially constructed scapegoats and I will attempt to address the question of what the racial landscape in America would have looked like if its Christians founders had engaged in what Adams calls “loving mimesis” toward those the founders had deemed “other”?\n\nBio: Julia Robinson Moore is an ordained Presbyterian minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA) and an Associate Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at UNC Charlotte. She teaches courses in African American religion, religions of the African Diaspora, and racial violence in America. She is the author of Race, Religion, and the Pulpit: Reverend Robert L. Bradby and the Making of Urban Detroit (Wayne State University Press, 2015). In my present research, I investigate the complexities of black and white race relations in the New South through the sacred context of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nFelicity McCallum\n\nTitle: Women and First Nations People Besieged: Why Getting Australia’s History Right is a National Emergency\n\nAbstract: In my part of our discussion, I will examine national emergencies in Australia. Every week, a woman dies from domestic violence and one First Nations person dies in jail. First Nations people currently constitute only 2.9% of the entire population of Australia, yet occupy 30% of our jails. Since the “Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC)” thirty years ago, there have been four hundr3ed and seventy more deaths, with no convictions. Both the paralysis around Australia’s official response and entrenched inaction regarding these crises can be traced to events that started in 1788, when British settlers, backed by the British military forces, invaded traditional First Nations’ societies in Australia. Rampant, violence, theft, and murder of First Nations people went largely unreported and unpunished. Kidnapping, theft, and sexual exploitation of First Nations Australian women was rife. These acts scandalised their husbands and led to revenge killings inflamed by outrage in a frenzied triangulation of desire. As result, the size of First Nations populations was decimated. Imported disease and forced dislocation of traditional cultural structures caused fertility rates to dive. Cries to stop the shocking violence against First Nations Australian people, so starkly evident in Australia’s judicial systems and prisons, fell on deaf ears. Why are women in Australia so vulnerable to death by violence from spouses in their own homes? How do these maladies reflect Girard’s “scapegoat mechanism” operative at so many levels of Australian’s national consciousness and day-to-day life? These are the questions I will explore.\n\nBio: Felicity McCallum has twenty-five years’ experience in education, in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of Australia and France. Felicity is an Awabakal woman. Her doctoral research focuses on the relationship and reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, with a particular reference to the theory of René Girard. She is First Nations Adviser to the National Council of Churches for Australia. She lectures at the Australian Catholic University and is a facilitator in formative spirituality and non-executive Director on a number of national boards in Australia.\n\nVern Neufeld Redekop\n\nTitle: Yeshua as Mimetic Model of Loving Mimesis in a Colonizing Context\n\nAbstract: In my part of our discussion, I will ask how Jesus lived within a context of double colonial structures where Rome controlled the country, and the Jewish Sadducee-dominated Sanhedrin controlled the official sacrificial system of the Temple. Jesus creatively constituted a Messianic role that would enact the essence of Torah and the Prophets through a framework of loving mimesis inspired by Isaiah—the Servant Songs and Is. 61:1-2 (see Luke 4:18-21), including “to set free (extend agency and capability to) those who were downtrodden.” Part of this action of empowerment was Jesus’ capacity to reframe actions. For example, the woman who gave two small coins was represented as giving more than the ostentatious contributions of the rich. The woman who poured perfume on Jesus’ feet is represented as anointing him––normally, an action performed by prophets. How can we use the narratives of Jesus heuristically to carve out our own “messianic” callings creatively, in other words, to engage in loving mimesis? How can we live freely and joyously in a context tainted by colonial legacies while resisting, deconstructing, and transforming oppressive power structures?\n\nBio: Vern Neufeld Redekop is a professor emeritus of conflict studies at Saint Paul University, Ottawa. He organized the COV&R 2006 Conference at Saint Paul University (Ottawa, Canada) on the theme of mimesis, creativity, and reconciliation. This conference led to two books which he edited with Thomas Ryba: René Girard and Creative Mimesis (2013) and René Girard and Creative Reconciliation (2014). His most recent publications (edited with Gloria Neufeld Redekop) are Awakening: Exploring Spirituality, Emergent Creativity, and Reconciliation (2019) and Transforming: Applying Spirituality, Emergent Creativity, and Reconciliation (2021).\n\nView the video of this panel presentation.\n\nHumanity is more than ever the author of its own fall because it has become able to destroy its world. -René Girard\n\nFrom July 10-14, 2013, the University of Northern Iowa will host the annual meeting of COV&R. The theme of this year’s conference is “A Land between Two Rivers: Space, Place, and Mimetic Theory.” This theme is an appropriate one to consider in Iowa, because visitors to the state find most memorable the vast expanses of land and sky. But the land, which has been central to Iowa’s economy and to the nation’s food supply, is undergoing massive change as industrial agriculture replaces family farms. With Iowa as a focus point for reflection, conference participants will consider how mimetic theory can illuminate ecological issues, contribute to environmental ethics, and inform our reflections on interconnections among organisms and varied forms of life.\n\nOur conversation will be facilitated by three keynote addresses on the conference theme. Laura JACKSON, who holds a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Cornell University and is a professor of biology at UNI, will help lay groundwork for our discussion, drawing on her expertise in ecology and sustainable agriculture. JACKSON will speak about the demise of the family farm and the rise of industrial agriculture, which is posing serious ecological challenges. Her presentation is “Restoring Ecological Health in an Agricultural Sacrifice Zone.”\n\nOur second keynote speaker, Whitney BAUMAN, a professor of religious studies at Florida International University and a graduate of Graduate Theological Union, will offer the Raven Foundation Lecture. The driving question behind BAUMAN’s specialization in the area of religion and ecology is: How do religious beliefs, insights, doctrines, and practices shape the material-physical worlds around us? Even if one does not adhere to or practice a given tradition, religions have shaped the cultures in which humans live. In BAUMAN’s work, he analyzes how answers to the “big questions” with which religions have grappled have shaped the human relationship with the rest of the natural world. He is especially interested in analyzing how these “big questions” are changed by forces such as global climate change and globalization. In the end, he understands these religious questions to be questions about ethics: how ought we to live responsibly as human beings vis. a vis. the rest of the natural world. Bauman will speak on “Religion, Ecology, and the Planetary Other: Opening Spaces for Difference.” Following his lecture, there will be a reception sponsored by the Raven Foundation.\n\nOur final keynote speaker will be Mark WALLACE from Swarthmore College. WALLACE, a graduate of the University of Chicago, will deliver the Raymund Schwager, S.J. Memorial Lecture. Early in his career, WALLACE edited Curing Violence: Essays on René Girard with Thee SMITH. He has not been engaged directly with mimetic theory in recent years and views the invitation to join us this summer as an opportunity to forge links between his early and current work. WALLACE’s research and writing now are situated within the emerging field of religion and ecology. Noting an affinity between religion and ecology, WALLACE sees the intellectual wager of this discipline as follows: the often unknown wellsprings of human beings’ perspectives on the environment must be tapped if we are to understand adequately how individuals and societies have conceived of their place in the natural world. WALLACE reflects on questions such as: Are human beings part of or beyond nature? Do human beings have obligations to other life forms? Does the cosmos have an inherent purpose or function? For WALLACE, these questions are religious, moral, and ecological at the same time. They animate WALLACE’s writing, especially in regard to the role Christianity has played in both deepening and ameliorating the environmental crisis in our time.\n\nIn order to facilitate our conversations with the keynote speakers, BAUMAN’s and WALLACE’s addresses will be followed by breakout sessions in which session participants will discuss the lectures in small groups. There also will be a “wrap-up” session on the keynote addresses that will afford the small groups an opportunity to share insights from their discussions when we reconvene in the auditorium. So also will all three keynote speakers engage each other in discussion on the conference theme. This synthesizing session will be facilitated by Wolfgang PALAVER.\n\nWe will continue our special emphasis on lynching during a plenary session. Julia ROBINSON, Barbara THIEDE, and Joseph WINTERS from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will speak on “Literary Lynchings: Mimetic Theory, Race, and Lynching in Jewish and African American Literature. “ René GIRARD’s treatise of the term “lynching” captures the socially constructed imaginary of perpetrators, the maleficence of rivalry and the dubious monsterization of their victims. Further, the term exposes the depths of mimetic transference of a society’s deviant propensities to reclaim and revalorize a communal identity over against a mythic surrogate. As GIRARD states, “The representation of lynching in myth is always found in a context that necessitates the inference of its reality, because only that inference can illuminate that myth as a whole in all its details.” The study of lynching, amid its multifaceted forms within global communities, promises to reveal the central efficacy of collective acts of violence, thereby unveiling the paradigmatic patterns of thought and behavior that shape oppressive ideologies. Lynching then, can become a lens by which to expose and even deconstruct historically reified and culturally defined narratives of race, religion, and even, gender. This year’s plenary on the study of mimetic theory and lynching addresses African American and Jewish literary productions.\n\nThe concluding plenary of the conference on Saturday afternoon, offered with the support of the Raven Foundation, will feature Brian MCLAREN and James ALISON speaking on “Exploring the New Paradigm: Girard and the Christianity of the 21st Century.” With reference to the new curriculum, Jesus The Forgiving Victim, which is being launched, MCLAREN and ALISON will explore some of the differences which GIRARD makes to how we read the Bible, how we might live the reality of Church, and what sort of worldwide networks we might find ourselves getting involved in as this understanding of Christianity takes wing. ALISON, whose work is informed by the thought of René GIRARD, is the author of many books including The Joy of Being Wrong: Original Sin through Easter Eyes and On Being Liked. He is featured in Jesus: The Forgiving Victim. MCLAREN founded Cedar Ridge Community Church, an innovative, transdenominational church in the Baltimore-Washington region. He recently left the pastorate to devote full time to writing and speaking. His books include, The Secret Message of Jesus, Everything Must Change, Finding Our Way Again, and A New Kind of Christianity.\n\nOther conference highlights will include a showing of the documentary Hellbound? A panel discussion of the film moderated by Adam ERICKSEN will feature filmmaker Kevin MILLER, Michael HARDIN, and Vanessa AVERY. Book sessions will feature The Girardians by James WILLIAMS, Beneath the Veil of the Strange Verses: Reading Scandalous Texts by Jeremiah ALBERG, and René Girard’s Mimetic Theory by Wolfgang PALAVER. Vanessa AVERY will offer a workshop about a new training program that has been designed to help institutional leadership, management and staff to identify the stages of scapegoating in the workplace, find effective ways to intervene, and ultimately transform organizational culture into a culture of healthy, above-board, generous relationality. She will present an overview of the training, (with a focus on the scapegoating model developed out of GIRARD’s thought), and some initial reflections from having completed the first run of the pilot program. In addition, over sixty papers will be featured in concurrent sessions at the conference.\n\nI look forward to welcoming everyone to Iowa. In addition to hosting a conference that promises to be dynamic and engaging, I also will be introducing you to the history and distinctive culture of the area. Special events during the conference will acquaint participants with some interesting and unique aspects of rural life and small-town America. These will include a “Friday night down-town” evening of dining and entertainment on Cedar Falls’ Main Street, an award winning shopping and dining district that is quintessentially Midwestern. There are three Saturday morning excursions from which to select. Some participants will travel to the Amana Colonies, site of one of America’s longest lasting Utopian communities that was settled by German Pietists in 1855. Others will visit the Seed Saver’s Exchange, a world-famous repository for heirloom seeds that features gardens, orchards, and White Park cattle. Because most seed companies produce only a few varieties of seed, seed repositories play a critical role. Large-scale agriculture favors genetic stock in which quantity of production and ease of transport (e.g. fruits impervious to bruising in transit) are more important than quality (e.g., taste). Further, large-scale agriculture crops lack genetic diversity. If diseases wipe out a particular crop, in the absence of a seed stock that is genetically different, the entire plant species may go extinct. The Seed Saver’s Exchange preserves genetic diversity as a protection against plant extinction. The Exchange also makes available to the individual gardener genetically diverse fruits and vegetables that enrich our eating experiences. The third excursion will be to the Cedar Hills Sand Prairie and will include a showing of the award winning documentary: America’s Lost Landscape: The Tallgrass Prairie. The conference will conclude with a wine and cheese reception and the traditional banquet. “Mimetic Magic,” a show by New York magician and Girardian, James WARREN, will follow the dinner."
