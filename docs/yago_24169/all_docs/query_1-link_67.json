        "text": "Biography\n\nCornel West is an American-born philosopher, civil rights campaigner, author, and actor. He was born on June 2, 1953 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but was brought up in Sacramento (Elder 1). He started his engagements in civil rights activities at an early age as seen when he organized protests to demand inclusion of certain study courses at the high school he was enrolled in. He also became the president of his class in the same high school. At the age of seventeen years, Cornel joined Harvard University where he received lectures from philosophers like Stanley Cavell and Robert Nozick. He graduated after three years of study in 1973 with a high distinction degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilization. Throughout his experience, West unwaveringly pushed the University into accepting his political ideas as opposed to him accepting the University’s agendas. In 1980, Cornel acquired his Ph.D. at Princeton University, where he had a chance to learn from the pragmatic Richard Rorty. Cornel went back to Harvard University under the Du Bois program while in his mid-twenties before he became an assistant professor in the New York-based Union of Theological Seminary. He also taught at Yale Divinity School where he engaged in protests that led to his arrest. After serving a jail term, he taught at Haverford College before joining Princeton University as a professor as well as a director of the African American Studies program. Together with scholars like Toni Morrison, West invigorated this program, which he headed from 1988 to 1994. West also became a professor at Harvard University where he taught African-American studies, but later returned to teach at Princeton University.\n\nWest is considered a great thinker as is demonstrated in his various contributions. He has acquired several honorary degrees, while his writing has won him a respectable book award. He is credited with several published works in theology studies and African American studies. These works together with others he has published in the popular press are commonly cited. Besides being an active member, he chairs several associations such as the Network of Spiritual Progressives, Democratic Socialists of America, Tikkun Community, and the International Bridges to justice. Cornel is also sought for his skills as a blurb-writer, speaker, honorary leader. West is also an active member of organizations such as the World Policy Council, which is a policy institute. Not only has the work done by West brought controversy and initiated debate on the issue of race, but it has also been applauded by other great thinkers.\n\nCornel has historically written several works that have been published. These include the Black Theology and Marxist Thought of 1979, the Prophesy Deliverance! An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity of 1982, the Prophetic Fragments of 1988, The American Evasion of Philosophy: A Genealogy of Pragmatism of 1989, Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life of 1991, The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought of 1991, Beyond Euro-centrism and Multiculturalism of 1993, Race Matters of 1993, Keeping Faith: Philosophy and Race in America of 1994, Jews and Blacks: A Dialogue on Race, Religion, and Culture in America co-written with Michael Lerner in 1995, The Future of the Race co-authored with Henry Gates, Jr. in 996, Restoring Hope: Conversations on the Future of Black America in 1997, The War Against Parents: What We Can Do For America’s Beleaguered Moms and Dads of 1998, The Future of American Progressivism of 1998, The African-American Century: How Black Americans Have Shaped Our Century co-authored with Henry Gates, Jr. in 2000, Cornel West: A Critical Reader of 2001, Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism of 2004, Hope On a Tightrope: Words and Wisdom of 2008, and Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud of 2009 (West 10-60).\n\nSummary of the theme of Cornell’s work from Kessler’s Voices of Wisdom\n\nThe theme of Cornell’s work, Race Matters in Kessler’s Voices of Wisdom: A Multicultural Philosophy Reader is race relations in America (Kessler 65). The work explores the plights of the African-American people such as poverty and low esteem, and that which revolve around the effects of racial prejudice. He notes that a racial class system has influenced distribution of income, wealth, and power such that the disadvantaged communities are denied several opportunities that they deserve. West’s writing gives an insight into various misconceptions, clashes, and stereotypes resulting from race by highlighting the failures and inadequacies of every race in America. He looks at the situation of race relations and the roots of the thinking that preserves this racial discomfort among various members of the American society.\n\nRace relations have been issues that have dogged the United States for a long time. West indicates that there has been widespread discrimination among the various races in the United States, but more so, to the black community. He proposes promotion of redistributive approaches such as affirmative action to enhance the lives of the disadvantaged lot. However, he notes that this has been misdirected and corrupted by the American system that has focused mostly on economic issues. He indicates that the market system and the black leadership have been the core reasons for the nihilism that has affected the black community. This has led further to the disadvantages of the black community. The book further points out that factors such as the current systems and black leadership are to blame for the deteriorated racial relations between the black community and other races. It cites affirmative action as spoiling the relations among the black people and the Jews, but at the same time applauds it as a means of solving racial injustices. West also views capitalism as a cause of the racial problems facing the blacks in America.\n\nThe reading brings forth important ideas and passages. It shows that racial discrimination is prevalent in America, and that sometimes it happens even without the knowledge of the perpetrator. Race Matters also indicates that racial prejudice promotes other forms of prejudice such as discrimination based on sex or gender. However, Cornell illustrates that adjustments to what the current systems in American emphasize can help in promoting healthy relations among the people of different racial backgrounds. The reading also notes the prevalence of nihilism in American and depicts it as a negative aspect for the wellbeing of the society. It indicates that this is a source of many problems that have dogged the black community. The book also highlights the need for resistance against systems and ideals that do not promote the wellbeing of people, more so, the black community. It proposes that the political leaders as well as the middle class should take a lead in championing the rights of the disadvantaged group in America. West also indicates that as much as affirmative action might be useful in some ways, it has also brought problems of relations among different races notably the blacks and Jews. The reading proposes a reorganization of the whole American economic system in order to achieve meaningful change regarding the racial dilemma.\n\nPersonal reflection on the reading\n\nRace Matters is a reading that allows one to delve deep into the subject of race in society. West links the problems of the black community in United States to the black leaders and the market system of the economy. It may be true the leaders are partly to blame, but the economic system may not bear much of the West’s blame. It is possible that a market system can promote employment and reduce crime within the black cities if law and order are strengthened. In this regard, the reading does not provide a positive direction to solving the problems of the minority, but rather adds to the problems. In fact, West’s depiction that it is a hopeless situation does not motivate the reader into finding solutions. Worse is that some of his suggestions are extreme and may not be practical in the near future. While the reading indicates correctly that there is a moral dimension to the problems facing the black people in America, it fails to direct the reader into finding solutions and largely blames the past.\n\nThe reading suggests that West is a centrist, but in some instances indicates the contrary. He denounces the notion that government programs that have only an economic dimension would solve the racial dilemma. This is a true assertion, however, Cornel makes a contradiction of himself when he rejects solutions that are race-specific but also approves of affirmative action. Moreover, he denounces arguments that are strengthened by racial solidarity, but at the same time points, in support, to a single instance where blacks supported Clarence Thomas. Therefore, it is possible that West’s arguments have political motives, but that he attempts to conceal.\n\nThe relations issue between the Jews and the African-Americans described in Race Matters is very controversial. The attempts to show the cause of the division between the Jews and the Blacks are evasive, flawed, and dishonest. The reading indicates accurately that affirmative action is a cause of the differences existing between the Jews and the Black. However, the assertion that the opposition by Jews to the affirmative is morally blind and has no link to democracy, fairness, or concern over racial balkanization is misplaced. Furthermore, the reading is ironic when referring to the interests of the Jewish in debating about a policy that puts the black community above any other race in economic rewards appointments.\n\nThe reading is however a unique view on the subject of race that is worth reading. It is a piece of writing that would propel the reader to rethink the issue of race. The style of writing is also cleverly chosen in that it allows a friendly reading. The theories are completely developed and it touches on small and vital issues that are easy to ignore. The reading provides various practical suggestions that are also supported by other thinkers. These suggestions would be worth implementing to address the race dilemma.\n\nWorks cited\n\nElder, Robert. Prisoner of hope. University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. 1998.
