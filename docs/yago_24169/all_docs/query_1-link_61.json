Race is the first thing we see when encountering another person. In fact, we immediately categorize people into racial groups. Yet, we have been socialized not to talk about race and were taught not to talk about race in polite conversation. Moreover, when we do talk about race, discomfort, defensiveness, and frustration often prevail, with comments surfacing such as: get over it, it happened 400 years ago, that’s in the past, we had a Black president, I don’t see color, or you are too sensitive, and the conversation shuts down. To eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity we must connect our past to our present and grow comfortable with conversations about race, racism, and racial justice. This chapter helps to move the dialogue from frightening, feared, difficult, and sensitive to necessary, meaningful, and productive.",
