        "text": "Cornel West, professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton University and author of best-selling book Race Matters (Beacon Press, 1993) and Democracy Matters (Penguin, 2004), will give a lecture titled “Courageous Dialogues: Democracy, Peace and Building Unity in Times of Division” on Wednesday, March 12 at 7 p.m. in the Hogan Ballroom at the College of the Holy Cross. The event, part of Unity Week at Holy Cross, is free and open to the public.\n\nWest, a defender of racial justice since childhood and one of the most provocative public intellectuals in the U.S., will share his beliefs and experiences with the Holy Cross community. Through his writing and speeches, West preaches for equality for all people, and many of his ideas are influenced by the Black Baptist Church, progressive politics, and jazz. In his autobiography The Cornel West Reader, (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) West says that he, “acknowledged and accented the empowerment of my black styles, mannerisms, and viewpoints, my Christian values of service, love, humility, and struggle, and my anti-colonial sense of self-determination for oppressed people and nations around the world.”\n\nDave Lipke '08, co-chair of the Student Government Association (SGA), believes that, \"SGA is making a concerted effort to represent student interests in all facets of life at Holy Cross. Student Governments' sponsorship of Dr. Cornel West's speech represents our commitment to foster ethical and academic dialogue about the social issues that impact all of us as a community.\"\n\nWest was admitted to Harvard University at the age of 17 and graduated in three years, magna cum laude. He pursued his Ph.D. at Princeton, where he is now a professor of religion and director of the Afro-American studies program. He has also taught at Yale, Harvard, Union Theology Seminary, and the University of Paris.\n\n\"Dr. West's visit will create a positive atmosphere on campus. It will also bring to light pertinent issues that we deal with in America,” says Jerry Dickinson ' 09, SGA director of diversity. “His ability to combine various disciplines, including politics, race, philosophy and religion, in his speeches is rare, but fascinating. Most importantly, he envisions a united America along race, ethnic, religious, gender and political lines, which is in keeping with our theme here at Holy Cross of ' men and women for others.'\"\n\nIn addition to Democracy Matters and Race Matters, West has published 16 other works and 13 other texts. His best-selling book, Race Matters, has sold over 40,000 copies and has become a required text in many college courses nationwide, including one at Holy Cross in black social and political thought, taught by Hussein Adam, Ph.D., associate professor of political science. He also starred in the last two films of the popular movie trilogy, The Matrix, as Councilor West on the council of Zion.\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Student Government Association, the Black Student Union, the office of multicultural education, the sociology & anthropology department, the political science department, the philosophy department, the Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture, the class deans, and academic services.\n\nHoly Cross Unity Week will run from March 10 -14. Members of the community emphasize unity and peace on this campus through a series of events celebrating our race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and lifestyle. Other events include an opening dinner with Holy Cross President Rev. Michael C. McFarland, S.J., discussion on interracial relationships, and a debate between the College Democrats and Republicans."
