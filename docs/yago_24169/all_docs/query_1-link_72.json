        "text": "Todd Anthony Walker*\n\nAbstract\n\nLegal controversies surrounding race and racism have persisted in America from its inception, but not without intervention. Supreme Court decisions in Dred Scott, Plessy and Brown trace the Court’s jurisprudential evolution while, legislatively, the passage of the post-civil rights Amendments, and, more recently, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, demonstrate Congresses’ intent to address racial equality, among other disparities. However, while some legal scholars and policy advocates suggest these measures are adequate, others point to their insufficiency or potential for overreach. Currently, amidst rising civil and political unrest, there is both a renewed interest in racial justice and increasing racial animus. This racial divide is perhaps most attributable to different conceptions of liberalism and legal redress which are captured, historically, by the words of the same civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and both penned in 1963. Dr. King famously made mention, seemingly affirming race-neutral individualism, of a “dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” (I Have a Dream, 1963) Yet he also wrote, depicting a vision of race-specific communitarianism, that “a price can be placed on unpaid wages. The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes.” (Why We Can’t Wait, 1963) As a consequence of such, seemingly, disparate statements from a seminal and symbolic Civil Rights leader, different conceptions of the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement have emerged.\n\nCatapulted into the American conversation on race by virtue of his pursuit and ascent to the presidency in 2008, Barack Obama, owing to personal biography and political philosophy, undeniably embodies King’s ‘content of their character’ dream. This article, which in part provides a review of President Obama’s reflections on race from his book, A Promised Land, also seeks to provide a historical context for examining the evolution of American thinking on racism and legal remedies. Juxtaposing the events of Andrew Johnson’s Amnesty Proclamation with Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign and inauguration, I explore some of the legal implications that emerge from competing visions of the Civil Rights Movement legacy, including, dichotomous understandings of racial remediation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nI.

M’Intosh: Interest Convergence & Redress\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1865, having concluded the Civil War, America embarked upon a new chapter in the democratic experiment fraught with different, but not less difficult challenges than those which characterized the former era of chattel slavery. Of great import, during this period of American history now known as Reconstruction, was the question of what would become of the nation’s former enslaved people? Notwithstanding Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not until the end of the war in 1865 that thousands of formerly disenfranchised enslaved people—now propertyless citizens—were thrust upon the nation. And the nation had no conception or plan for what their economic and political inclusion in American society would be. Unfortunately, despite decades of forced servitude resulting in free labor, the nation failed to provide an economic foundation, not to mention recompense, for most of these newly freed African Americans. Observing this tragic set of circumstances in 1880, Fredrick Douglass lamented, “could the nation have been induced to listen . . . some of the evils which we now suffer would have been averted.”\n\nOne hundred and twenty-eight years after Frederick Douglass’ critique regarding the treatment of recently emancipated Black people, America elected its first Black president—Barack H. Obama—and many wondered, if only fleetingly, whether that ‘old dragon,’ racism, was dead. Certainly, for most Americans, President Obama’s inauguration was at least symbolic of a significant step in the right direction concerning race relations. Moreover, for many Black Americans, including this author, it represented the removal of another “racist stain”—an imputed ideological connection between Blackness and subjugation, referred to in Antebellum America as “a badge of slavery”—and the hope that this nation might fulfill its promise of equality for all. Few would have imagined during President Obama’s inauguration in 2008 that our nation would again be so divided along racial lines. As I write today, we are still contending with the aftermath of Summer 2020 racial justice protests, an attempted insurrection, two impeachments, electoral questions, and looming uncertainty regarding the stability and efficacy of America’s two-party political structure. Despite the proclamation and hope by many that America had entered a post-racial society with the election of President Obama, the tensions of racialized capitalism—a unique formulation of free market economics founded upon the exploitation of Africans and Native Americans—have persisted.\n\nIn his latest book, A Promised Land, President Obama acknowledges as much, noting the ongoing struggle between the nation’s ideals, what he calls “the possibility of America,” and America’s troubling tendency towards “conquest and subjugation, a racial caste system and rapacious capitalism.” However, he stops short of abdicating the “idea of America” or denouncing it as pure mythology. Rather, grounded in pragmatism, President Obama conveys that, as president, “by appealing to what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature I stood a greater chance of leading us in the direction of the America we’ve been promised.” Indeed, most will agree that President Obama’s uncanny ability to identify and articulate common interests, and elicit common goodwill, perhaps more than all his other gifts, is what translated his presidential candidacy from mere possibility to reality. Notably, one of President Obama’s early models in politics, Harold Washington—Chicago’s first Black mayor—convinced President Obama that “a political campaign based on racial redress, no matter how reasonable, generated fear and backlash and ultimately placed limits on progress.” Instead, what President Obama sought was a “politics that bridged America’s racial, ethnic, and religious divides,” as well as the many strands of his own life.\n\nThis paper examines how President Obama’s vision of racial progress aligns with presumptions underlying resurging calls for racial reparations—assessing this comparison in light of the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Presidential politics at two historical inflection points—the emancipation of America’s enslaved Black people and the election of America’s first Black president—provide the context for this exploration. First, in the aftermath of Abraham Lincoln’s death, I trace the history of Andrew Johnson’s “Amnesty Proclamation” during Reconstruction. Next, I follow President Obama’s 2008 campaign, as primarily articulated in Part Two of A Promised Land. Utilizing these narratives and other critical texts, I explore two interrelated legal questions: 1) What do legal norms of race-neutrality and individualism imply about the nature of racial progress?; and 2) How does interest convergence impact efforts to provide redress for group harm?\n\nI. Amnesty Proclamation\n\nNear the conclusion of the Civil War, in Savannah, Georgia, the heart of the deep south, General William T. Sherman and other Union leaders met to discuss the fate of a multitude of newly freed Black people. Green-Meldrim House, now a Gothic Revival Mansion, then a classic two-story plantation home, was chosen by Sherman and Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, as the site to consult with a group of the newly emancipated. Reverend Garrison Frazier—an eloquent man and imposing figure at well over six feet tall—was selected to represent the freedmen. This conversation, like others between Union officials and formerly enslaved Black people, undoubtedly covered a myriad of topics: from economic self-sufficiency and governance to the more immediate practical concerns of food, clothing, and shelter. Sherman’s memoir records portions of his dialogue with Rev. Frazier. Responding to Sherman’s question regarding how the newly freed Black people would want to live in former Confederate states, “whether scattered among the whites,” or in colonies by themselves, Rev. Frazier suggested a preference to “live by ourselves, for there is prejudice in the South that will take years to get over.” Rev. Frazier’s concern was more than conjecture. As one southerner observed during this time period, the “feeling against any ownership of land [in the South] by negroes is so strong that the [white] man who should sell small tracts to them would be in actual personal danger.”\n\nFour days after his conversation with Rev. Frazier, General Sherman issued Special Field Order 15, which later became known as “40 acres and a mule,” indicating that: “each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground.” Although “mules” were not an explicit part of this order, the fact that many land recipients received leftover Army mules contributed to the more well-known colloquialism. Practically speaking, Sherman’s signing of Special Field Order No. 15 authorized the setting aside of 400,000 acres of confiscated Confederate land for freed people, but the “possessory titles” issued were provisional—granting the right to use but not to own the land—ultimately subject to approval by the president. Notably, after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, his successor, Andrew Johnson—a southerner—began issuing presidential pardons to southern whites and Confederates. These pardons, which enabled southerners to reclaim their formerly confiscated land if they paid their taxes, renounced the confederacy, and swore allegiance to the Union, effectively repealed Sherman’s Special Field Order 15—amounting to a proverbial “bait and switch” from the freedman’s perspective. Consequently, thousands of formerly enslaved people were effectively consigned to forced migration or sharecropping and, thereby, a cycle of indebtedness and impoverished conditions.\n\nNaturally, Johnson’s Amnesty Proclamation exerted significant influence in the lives of formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants. However, curiously, the legislative, political, and economic relationship between “40 acres and a mule” and the Amnesty proclamation has not been widely discussed, and as a consequence, is not broadly understood. Rather, an incomplete narrative touting the government’s betrayal of a “promise” that granted “40 acres and a mule” to newly freed Black people has risen to the level of historical fact. Certainly, it is quite possible that part of the attraction to this incomplete depiction is the sense, at least amongst liberal thinkers and many within the Black community, that such a commitment was warranted. Some progressive white senators during Reconstruction, including Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, advocated for as much. But, in fact, no such executive or congressional Federal commitment to support Sherman’s Field Order No. 15 ever occurred, and thus it does not appear the case that the United States federal government—as a collective decision-making body—ever intended to compensate formerly enslaved Black people.\n\nNot surprisingly then, but ironically, ubiquitous public discussion after the Civil War centered around compensating former slave owners—a political stratagem that was deemed necessary by government officials seeking to ‘bind the nation’s wounds and preserve the Union.’ But what of the wounds of formerly enslaved Black people—were they not also part of the nation? At the conclusion of the war, the Union was in possession of over 800,000 acres of land confiscated from the Confederacy, but ultimately, as a result of Johnson’s Amnesty Proclamation, within a year of the war’s end, the Freedmen Bureau—the government entity created in part to manage land redistribution—had returned more that 400,000 acres back to Southern white landowners. By the middle of 1867, “all but 75,000 acres were in the hands of their original owners.”\n\nHistorically, American political and, more so, presidential decision-making has always been fraught with such compromises—at times sacrificing “Black humanity on the altars of political and economic necessity” to promote pragmatism and expediency. It was this priority for pragmatism, in fact, that Abraham Lincoln grappled with as he weighed options regarding Emancipation and the preservation of the Union, concluding: “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it.” Ironically, one hundred and fifty years later, another senator from Illinois would once again contend with the tensions between “racial progress” and political compromise as president—however, this time, in part because of his own “mixed-race” status.\n\nII. Yes We Can\n\nPresident Obama realized early in his inaugural presidential bid that “a president wasn’t a lawyer or accountant or a pilot, hired to carry out some narrow, specialized task. Mobilizing public opinion, shaping working coalitions—that was the job.” He also recognized that, for better or worse, “people were moved by emotion, not facts.” The identification and articulation of common interests, appealing to what Abraham Lincoln called our “better angels,” was his objective—and likely Obama’s only path to victory.\n\nActivists and intellectuals supporting President Obama’s candidacy “in pure symbolic terms” expected him to take what he deemed to be “uncompromising positions on everything from affirmative action to reparations and [was] continually on alert for any hints that [he] might be spending too much time and energy courting middle-of-the-road, less progressive White folks.” His advisors worried, not without historical merit, that too much focus on issues considered specific to Black people would trigger suspicion and backlash from the broader electorate. President Obama’s goal was to become neither a supplicant for liberal benefactors, unable to make decisions independent of these constituents, nor a “permanent protestor” waiting for “White America to expiate its guilt,” for he believed that both approaches were born of despair. To transcend this old logic, he would have to win. To accomplish this objective, President Obama knew that he would need to “use language that spoke to all Americans and propose policies that touched everyone . . . [embracing] White people as allies rather than impediments to change, and to couch the African American struggle in terms of a broader struggle for a fair, just, and generous society.”\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged the tightrope he was walking, bound as he was to “specific communities of flesh and blood, filled with men and women who had their own imperatives and their own personal histories.” No one, perhaps, in President Obama’s personal sphere of influence, exhibited such contradictory impulses to the extent of Reverend Jeremiah Wright—his pastor from Chicago. Rev. Wright’s comments, reported in a Rolling Stone article, that America believes in “White supremacy and Black inferiority and believe[s] it more than we believe in God”—created a significant controversy at the inception of President Obama’s candidacy. In fact, Rev. Wright had been scheduled to lead a prayer in front of an assembled crowd—where President Obama was to announce his candidacy—before the article was published a day earlier, forcing a change in plans from the public invocation to a private one.\n\nNot unexpectedly, this chain of events triggered a significant reaction within the white and Black community, with a menagerie of Black voices arguing that President Obama “wasn’t ready,” or “was too radical, or too mainstream, or not quite Black enough.” Encouragement came from Dr. Otis Moss, a vanguard of the Civil Rights Movement, and close friend and associate of both Dr. King and Rev. Wright, who shared with President Obama that “every generation is limited by what it knows.” It was Dr. Moss’ biblical analogy that Dr. King and others, like Dr. Moss, were part of the Moses generation, destined to lead the people to the promise land but not enter it, while President Obama and others like him were part of the Joshua generation, “responsible for the next leg of the journey,” that convinced President Obama that what he was “trying to do was worth it, that it wasn’t just an exercise in vanity or ambition but rather a part of an unbroken chain of progress.” In fact, in President Obama’s view, electoral politics is where the energy of the Civil Rights Movement had migrated. Buttressed by the support of Dr. Moss and others, he preserved the common-struggle approach, and ten months later, President Obama walked into an auditorium in Columbia, South Carolina, where a multi-ethnic—mostly college aged—crowd was chanting: “Race doesn’t matter! Race doesn’t matter!”\n\nBut “race” did matter. Shortly after the rally in Columbia, and more than a year after the initial Rev. Wright coverage in Rolling Stone, ABC News compiled a series of short clips, running on Good Morning America, in which Rev. Wright—in a vivid display of Black radicalism—called America the “USA of KKK” and intoned, “Not God bless America. God damn America.” Such rhetoric from many Black pulpits was not uncommon, in some ways a reflection of “the periodic need to let loose, to release pent-up anger from a lifetime of struggle in the face of chronic racism, reason and logic be damned.” Understanding the political risks, President Obama decided he needed to make a speech on race to staunch the political bleeding. Airing on all the major networks, he described how many complexities in the American family have resulted from America’s racial legacy. Performing an oratorical balancing act, President Obama explained how some Black folks and historically Black institutions “might still harbor bitterness toward—and feel betrayed by—a country they loved” but also how “White Americans might resist, or even resent, claims of injustice from Blacks—unhappy with any presumption that all Whites were racists, or that their own fears and day-to-day struggles were less valid.”\n\nUltimately, President Obama sought to communicate that “unless we could recognize one another’s reality . . . we would never solve the problems that America faced.” Sharing a story from his youth that involved his white grandmother and a Black panhandler who had ‘frightened’ her, apparently, by virtue of nothing other than the panhandler’s race, President Obama analogized his own mixed heritage with that of America. His goal, it seemed, was to convey the idea that both realities, white and Black—with all their contradictions, fears, unreconciled pain, and shame—were part of a shared “American identity” possessed by both Black and white folk. The speech worked—if only temporarily. Several weeks later, when Rev. Wright announced at the National Press Club that America was “racist at its core” and President Obama had denounced Rev. Wright’s previous comments because “that’s what politicians do to get elected,” President Obama was forced to make a clean break from Rev. Wright. With a brief statement unequivocally denouncing Rev. Wright’s comments and separating himself from the provocative pastor, President Obama effectively closed the door on the “Wright controversy,” leaving for another day the issue of America’s deeply conflicted view on race and racial progress exposed by “Wright’s commentary.”\n\nIII. The Beloved Community: Race Neutrality & Individualism\n\nDuring his lifetime, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. offered the concept of the “Beloved Community” as a model for racial reconciliation, and since that time, scholars and theologians have provided competing interpretations regarding what characteristics and conditions such a community would require. Professor Anthony Cook, in his exploration of reparations for Black Americans, explains the tension between a conception of the “Beloved Community” as a race-neutral “liberal commitment to a color-blind society,” versus a “Beloved Community” asserting the need for “public atonement that entails a process of confession and restitution-based repentance.” Cook’s view is that policies born of race-neutrality which attempt racial reconciliation, like President Obama’s, superficially treat the wounds of racism, “wounds that continue to fester beneath the surface of color-blind laws, policies, and interactions.” Cook believes these policies aim to remediate racial disparities without exclusively targeting benefits to members of the “historically injured” racial group.\n\nHowever, the importance of the “Beloved Community” extends beyond redress. Just as much, it is about the symbolic legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. More specifically, it is a question of which Dr. King America envisions—either President Obama’s liberal, race-neutral individualistic, judged by the “content of your character” Dr. King, or Professor Cook’s radical, race-specific communitarian, “a price can be placed on unpaid wages” Dr. King. Part of this answer rises and falls on the manner in which we choose to interpret Dr. Moss’ insight, spoken to President Obama in the aftermath of the first Rev. Wright incident, that “every generation is limited by what it knows.” For President Obama, the “limitation” of the King generation was encapsulated by desperate attempts for racial redress in the form of politically divisive appeals to reparations and other extreme positions. In the view of Professor Cook, Cornel West, and others, the “limitation” refers to this present generations inability to see beyond the dominant culture’s sanitized depiction of Dr. King—a characterization that strips Dr. King’s ideology of its egalitarian, and perhaps radical, transformative qualities.\n\nThese distinct interpretations of the “limitation” emerge from differing rights-based liberal commitments to policies of racial redress, either race-neutral or race-specific, which are respectively associated with notions of “individualism” and “communitarianism.” Legal scholar Duncan Kennedy has observed that the individualism pervading American law is based on self-reliance, which means “an insistence on defining and achieving objectives without help from others (i.e., without being dependent on them or asking sacrifices of them.)” Notably, this conception of individualism as “autonomous self,” providing the basis for classical liberal theory, assumes little responsibility for the past, requiring only that “individuals do not presently engage in discrimination based on the irrationality of race and that they be personally liable for past discrimination committed by them against an identifiable victim.”\n\nIn contrast, reform liberal theory asserts “that the present effects of the past are undesirable and not in the genuine self-interest of the present generation to tolerate.” The distinction, Cook observes, is centered on the role of the state and how far back the state’s power extends in correcting “certain ‘free market’ failures or social inequalities due to ‘irrational’ or ‘immoral’ decision-making based on race, among other things.” In the classical liberal view, the “rights” that the Constitution ensures are “individual” rights and may not be encroached upon no matter how noble the cause. However, ironically, persisting notions of Black inferiority—cognitive, cultural, or otherwise—consistently pointed to as rationales for Black underachievement—are group-based. Cook notes that “Blacks are made to be individuals when they seek group redress but are made members of a group when the dominant culture wishes to disparage and subordinate them.”\n\nSuggesting a way forward, Professor Cook points to the need for a discourse that “nurtures an understanding of individuality that recognizes our connection to and responsibility for the past—a discourse that balances individualism with the need to appreciate and reckon with the role of historically constructed group identities.” Such an understanding, in Cook’s view, would provide an ideological ‘space’ for reparations. However, Critical Legal Studies scholars question whether pursuing legal rights such as the “right to reparations” is a futile effort. They note that “floor entitlements can be turned into ceilings (you’ve got your rights, but that’s all you’ll get). Formal rights without practical enforceable content are easily substituted for real benefits.” Additionally, “the powerful can always assert counter rights ([such as] vested property rights, differential treatment according to ‘merit,’ and the right to associate with one’s own kind) to the rights of the disadvantaged. ‘Rights’ conflict—and the conflict cannot be resolved by appeal to rights.” Conceived in this way, rights discourse may impede genuine democracy and justice—the suggestion being that an articulation of needs would be a more effective strategy to advance the interests of marginalized groups.\n\nIn support of reparations and other remedial measures, Critical Race scholars point out that the critique of rights, inclusive of the right to reparations, neglects the historical potential of rights in the real lives of Blacks, women, and others who have not always been conferred rights. Patricia Williams, Professor of Law at Columbia Law School and Critical Race theorist, observes that “Blacks have been describing their needs for generations . . . [amidst] a long history of legislation against the self-described needs of Black people.” As such, the suggestion of pursuing rights as “meritless” lacks force where Blacks have been excluded even from the humanity of rights-based discourse.\n\nAs an alternative to a liberal, rights-based, individualism, Cook suggests “communitarianism,” which acknowledges and nurtures cultural and historical group identities, and fosters the understanding “that intra-group as well as inter-group dynamics can become repressive and deny individuals the human dignity and respect to which they are entitled.” Jennifer Nash, Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies at Duke University, aligns communitarianism with a love-politics that emphasizes “mutual vulnerability” and “witnessing.” The goal being to transform “love from the personal . . . into a theory of justice.” Nash’s conception of mutual vulnerability, mirroring Dr. King’s notion of the “inescapable network of mutuality,” is that “my survival and thriving depend on yours. If our survivals are mutually dependent, we are, then, mutually vulnerable, as our thriving requires coexistence.” It is from this perspective that non-violent resistance as a social change strategy emerged, embracing the possibility and probability of injury, and more broadly, of being ‘undone,’ as a mechanism for awakening the humanity of others. For Cook, “mutuality” also means that “groups must construct and maintain their group identities with a special consideration for how those identities impact the least of these among the group, that is, the most vulnerable and disempowered elements of that particular group.” This is particularly complicated for Black folks, because of the complexities inherent in the intersections of race, gender, and class.\n\nPractically speaking, Patricia Williams argues that Blacks and other marginalized groups must advocate for an expansion of rights. This means extending “rights” beyond an expectation of individual civil rights, to an expectation of collective human rights. In essence, transitioning social and legal discourse beyond direct instances of “injury in fact” based on civil status, to also account for collateral aggregates of “systemic injury,” predicated on human status. This is not a foreign concept to American jurisprudence, but, as described in Part IV, has heretofore been applied only in narrow circumstances.\n\nAccording to Williams, “for [B]lacks the battle is not deconstructing rights, in a world of no rights; nor of constructing statements of need, in a world of abundantly apparent need. Rather, the goal is to find a political mechanism that can confront the denial of need [for human recognition].” Williams suggests that policy makers and legal scholars imagine a legal project where “[t]he task . . . is not to discard rights, but to see through or past them so that they reflect . . . the [human] right to expect civility from others.” This legal project, which includes interrogating social norms, policies, and practices, is premised upon Dr. King’s recognition of the equal “dignity and worth of all human personality.” Notably, such an approach to rights requires a nuanced understanding and commitment to liberal notions of autonomy, and in America, necessitates revisiting a long history of jurisprudence which has, in most instances, privileged individualism over communitarianism.\n\nIV. Johnson V. M’intosh: Interest Convergence & Redress\n\nPresident Obama, in his introduction of A Promised Land, observes that America has always been haunted by a constant push pull between our better angels and our worst impulses. He references Johnson v. M’Intosh, the landmark land acquisition dispute calling into question the possessory interests of the United States versus the Illinois and Piankeshaw nations. In writing the decision for that case, Chief Justice Marshall opines that “conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny,” and while “the conquered shall not be wantonly oppressed . . . their condition shall remain eligible as is compatible with the objects of the conquest.” His use of the phrase, “shall remain eligible as is compatible with the objects of the conquest,” deserves special attention when considering remedies for racial discrimination. John Marshall, the nation’s first Chief Justice—charged with protecting the fledgling Constitution—with this remark drew a jurisprudential “line in the sand.” Specifically, Marshall delineates between the rights of the conqueror and the conquered and determines the need for compatibility if any rights of the conquered are to be acknowledged at all. Modernly, it is for this reason that some scholars have expressed concern regarding the feasibility of utilizing legal strategy (which relies on the constitutional jurisprudence) to advance racial justice and to support redress for racial discrimination.\n\nAlan David Freeman, for example, observes that the conception of available legal remedies to “racial discrimination” is shaped by whether the notion is approached from a victim perspective or perpetrator perspective. From the perspective of the victim, “racial discrimination describes those conditions of actual social existence as a member of a perpetual underclass . . . [including] both the objective conditions of life—lack of jobs, lack of money, lack of housing—and the consciousness associated with those objective conditions—lack of choice and lack of human individuality in being forever perceived as a member of a group rather than as an individual.” In contrast, “[t]he perpetrator perspective sees racial discrimination not as conditions, but as actions, or series of actions, inflicted on the victim by the perpetrator.”\n\nSignificantly, American jurisprudence, from its constitutional inception, has consistently affirmed that the starting point of its prototypical legal subject is white, male, and landowner or wealthy, which simply means that when the interests of others come in conflict with those of white males (in particular, wealthy white males) the law acts, by its substance and interpretation, to preserve the interest of individuals from this group as a status quo. Legal scholar Derrick Bell describes this phenomenon, which Chief Justice John Marshall deemed “compatibility,” as “interest-convergence,” noting that a powerful majority only yields to the demands of a minority group to the extent that the minority groups’ interests are aligned with that of the dominant group. Hence, as a legal concept, “antidiscrimination law” has been operationalized from a perpetrator’s perspective such that the legal standard prioritizes how the race-dependent decisions of potential perpetrators are carried out, while remaining relatively indifferent to the condition of victims. Under this current formulation, a violation of antidiscrimination law requires that a perpetrator must both intend to cause and actually cause disparate outcomes on the basis of race. Thereby, group harm that results from systemic and historical marginalization—specifically, those conditions of oppressed peoples not in the interest of the powerful to remediate—is obscured from view and, on these grounds, is immune from remedial treatment under the law.\n\nOne has to wonder whether President Obama’s appeal to “common interests” was something different from “compatibility” and “interest-convergence,” or whether it was the same concept by another name. Certainly, for President Obama, this mode of operation represented the pragmatic approach, as there are many issues where both whites and Blacks, especially amongst the poor and working class, can and do benefit. Perhaps this explains President Obama’s ardent commitment to universal healthcare, also known as Obamacare. However, as much as Blacks and whites are alike in their humanity, there are some differences in their social experiences—specifically among them, experiences regarding race and racism. The core challenge for policy makers and politicians like President Obama is how to address the social consequences of racism without injuring “innocent” individuals. This is the crux of the perpetrator perspective when faced with the victim perspective, and vice versa.\n\nUndergirding the perpetrator perspective, colorblind theory, which presupposes a world where the actions of individuals take place and can be accounted for “argues that because society has conquered racism and people of color and white people have full equality, social policies should not take account of race.” Many people, laymen and political pundits alike, argue that this is what must precipitate Dr. King’s vision of a world where his children “would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” However, this view ignores Dr. King’s vision that “a price can be placed on unpaid wages” because it does not account for the persisting impact of the nation’s de jure discrimination, nor the de facto sanctioning of oppressive practices under the presupposition of rule of law. Practically speaking, politicians, especially presidents, must be committed to preserving the rule of law. As a Black American president, President Obama is perhaps the greatest symbolic realization of Dr. King’s Dream for “judgement by the content of one’s character.” But President Obama, unlike prior presidents, was faced with the duality of enforcing a rule of law that has consistently been interpreted in ways that disadvantage Black people—”his” people—and discount their experiences of racism.\n\nProfessor Robin West, feminist legal theorist and Professor of Law and Philosophy at Georgetown University Law Center, captures the American commitment to the rule of law as first, affirming the public will over the private will and second, affirming the value of representative democracy. The question for President Obama, in a society committed to individualism but fractured by disparate experiences and understandings of race and racism, became “which public” and “whose representation?” Especially because “different but binding norms within the legal system may each warrant conflicting outcomes [concerning rule of law].” Put another way, fairness to one group or individual is often perceived as injustice to others. To wit, “Stand Your Ground” laws, often advocated for by Second Amendment advocates, are equally objectionable to many within the Black community.\n\nSo then how does the rule of law get determined? Legal scholars observe that the rule of law in America is determined by the dominant group, such that a legal proposition is determinate when there is agreement, by force or consent, that “the rules in play compel a single conclusion.” For example, government officials forcefully imposed both segregation and desegregation on American citizens because the desired outcomes were thought to be “right.” Both historically and contemporarily, there is broad consensual agreement amongst American citizens that a crime such as felony murder is deserving of severe punishment.\n\nConversely, legal propositions become “indeterminate [or ambiguous] when some socially significant group finds it useful to raise legal claims that theretofore seemed frivolous; [under such circumstances] their arguments will become first professionally respectable and then reasonably powerful as their social or political power increases.” Some recent examples include challenges to longstanding police practices surrounding the use of “Stop and Frisk,” “No Knock Warrants,” “Chokeholds,” and “Bodycams.” Indeterminacy creates the opportunity for political decision makers and lawyers to make changes in policy, and for citizens to advocate for more inclusive laws or to enforce existing rights. Hence the power of the Civil Rights movement, led by Dr. King and others, and now, perhaps Black Lives Matter.\n\nHowever, there is disagreement regarding how such socially significant groups and movements are best conceived and maintained. Abolitionist scholars, in the tradition of Frederick Douglass and those promoting a liberal conception of Dr. King, argue that the Constitution may be interpreted expansively, utilizing concepts of liberalism and individualism to incorporate and advance the interest of groups that the framers did not originally intend to protect. Historically, this approach has garnered important rights, but with limitations. Others, like Professor Cook and the scholars promoting a radical conception of Dr. King, contend that there must be a fundamental paradigm shift in legal thinking, involving a substantive overhaul of constitutional interpretation, moving from individualism to communitarianism in order to achieve racial redress. Still, scholars, including some abolitionists, have argued that authentic racial reconciliation and reparations would require a total rejection of the Constitution.\n\nProfessor Dorothy Roberts, race, gender, and legal scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, explores the tension between a total rejection of the Constitution versus a more expansive interpretation of the Constitution as a means for addressing systemic racism in her critique of the prison industrial complex. Roberts meticulously traces the rise of the prison industrial complex from slavery, noting the connection of overseers and slave patrols supported by slave codes and Black codes to modern-day policing, comparing slavery and sharecropping to convict leasing, and lynching to the death penalty. Extrapolating from Fredrick Douglass’ Reconstruction lament, she asserts that the prison industrial complex arises from the failure to incorporate “freed African Americans into the social order . . . [such that the law as applied to Blacks] is not primarily designed to protect people from crime, but rather to address human needs and social problems with punitive measures.”\n\nDistinctively, scholars advancing an approach of “expanded interpretation” do so from a forward-looking (not remedial) posture and advocates arguing for total rejection of the Constitution assert an ideological position which, as a practical matter, has proved politically untenable in terms of results. As such, reparations are outside the scope of these legal frameworks. However, communitarianism, which postulates a “Social Awakening” couched in “Social Atonement,” might provide a viable legal construct to support a call for reparations under the rubric of racial reckoning. For Dr. King, the notion of Social Atonement, restoring the fraternity and solidarity of humanity, was based upon a recognition that sins such as racism were both personal and social, which “alienated individuals from one another and blinded them to their common humanity and mutual dependency.” To accomplish this, Cook suggests that “America needs its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission, similar to the South African model in which the stories of victims of oppression and the beneficiaries of oppression can be heard.” However, as President Obama noted, there is a disconnect between whites and Blacks on the subject of race which would make it difficult to achieve broad consensus towards such a project. This communicative gap, at least in part, emerges from the curation of racist ideas (overt or implicit; subconscious or conscious) in our nation’s storytelling institutions—inclusive of schools, colleges and universities, and media outlets—such that content and images, or the lack thereof, become instructive. It is notable that the “baseline for everyday conversations about race in America is very different for whites than it is for Blacks . . . [for whites] it is exceedingly difficult for one to confess when one does not acknowledge that there has been—and continues to be—transgression.”\n\nCook suggests that “a movement for Black reparations must be part of a broader movement for social justice,” just like Dr. King was in the process of planning a transracial and transcultural Poor People’s Campaign. One approach might be to couch Black reparations within a larger vision for a binary economy, which would seek to distribute capital ownership more broadly to the working poor and middle class. This is possible, but not probable, until and unless there is major paradigm shift in the American conception of individualism—from the “autonomous self” to “an intergenerational self, as well as a communal self, [conceptualized as] a byproduct of past histories and future possibilities pushing their way into the defining present moment.” It is only the intergenerational and communal self—as a legal and social entity—that can recognize the inherent contradiction in the receipt of a “present benefit” which results from a “past deficit,” unjustly imposed upon the ancestors of some, to confer a future reward upon the heirs of others. Currently, legal precedents are receiving increasing attention that might support the rise of a socially significant movement with the efficacy to, perhaps, spark a national change of heart and mind regarding Black reparations.\n\nLegal historian Professor Burlette Carter distinguishes between what she sees as the valuable proposition in “debating reparations” from “adopting an economic reparations strategy.” In fact, there are noted distinctions in legal precedents regarding other groups that have received economic reparations from the American government, as well as challenges with the applicability of international law. But that is not the seat of Carter’s objection. While acknowledging the profitability of utilizing reparations as a means of fostering an understanding of racism’s impact on Black people, she suggests that the emotional and economic costs of political “horse-trading”—surrendering Black claims considered non-compensable, minimizing Black injury to economic considerations, and the impracticability in tracing Black injuries—make reparations a non-viable theory of recovery. In Carter’s view, the primary hinderance to Black reparations is not legal theory. Rather, she points to a persisting racist ideology which has led to the narrow application of legal theories of recovery—with regard to descendants of formerly enslaved persons—that could otherwise provide a vehicle for Black reparations. As an alternative, she suggests that what is needed is the ideological divestiture of unjust enrichment from Black subjugation, noting that “absent measures to reduce the value of whiteness as property, the post-reparations [B]lack dollar will still buy only a fraction of what the post-reparations white dollar will buy. The white dollar will still be spent in white neighborhoods, not in Black ones. And, [B]lack life will still be worth less than white life. The problems that lie at the heart of economic downturns in Black communities will remain.” She suggests that true reparations must repair communities and is established through the “efforts of attorneys, legal scholars, politicians, activists, or even doctors, architects and stockbrokers, who make crossing racial divides and remedying racial injustice even a small part of their work.” This perspective is largely persuasive, considering legal precedents where there have been efforts to address or remediate racial discrimination, and the history of institutional responses to social pressures and court orders.\n\nIn 2000, Professor Carter forecasts, almost prophetically, the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, noting that “the continued insistence on whiteness as property will necessarily require the establishment of Blackness as property.” However, more poignantly, she observes that America will not “have [racial] reconciliation—or Dr. King’s beloved community—until rights in racial property have been both acknowledged by all and surrendered by all.”\n\nConclusion\n\nSo then, what might it take to “rehabilitate humanity” in America, a nation where competing impulses, as aptly described by President Obama in A Promised Land, have often caused us to “bite and devour” one another surrounding the issue of race? Ultimately, the question that presents itself in this essay is whether reparations, economic or otherwise, have the capacity or tendency to move us closer or further away from this desired end. Interestingly, Professor Carter in her explanation of why she personally does not support economic reparations for Black Americans, analogizes the pursuit as “spitting into the wind,” and, while I understand the point she is trying to make, this analogy is imperfect.\n\nTo start, spitting is a pejorative act, not a justifiable one. In fact, in many states, spitting on a person under certain circumstances is considered a felony. Moreover, approaching the analogy from a point-taken perspective—namely, that attempts to secure economic reparations for Black folks will ultimately end up backfiring on them, so they are not worth pursuing—leaves the casual reader with the wrong impression. This is because the way the explanation of why a particular thing will not work—or think it will not work—is just as important, if not more so, than the “fact” it actually may not work. In a real sense, the explanation determines how people conceive of the viable options that will work. Put another way, it must be asked whether economic reparations—despite the difficulties associated with their calculation and implementation—are a necessary, albeit insufficient condition, in pursuit of racial redress. To this end, while the more expansive definition of “true reparations” offered by Carter—which focuses primarily on the need for self-empowerment within the Black community and her analysis of the way in which “whiteness as property” contributes to racial disparities is certainly appreciated, I am not as convinced as she is that economic reparations, whether as tort compensation or restitution, should not be part of the social formulation—a “cocktail of remedial drugs”—necessary to address the underlying condition of systemic racism in America.\n\nPresident Obama’s own notion of American rehabilitation on the issue of race is by and large, progressive—calling for “a mixture of optimism and strategic patience.” However, it is difficult to tell exactly what he means from his assertion that reparations are “born of despair.” Namely, in what ways are reparations born of despair? Are they “born of despair” because they represent a non-workable legal or economic strategy for remediating racial inequity, or because they represent a non-viable political strategy for maintaining American democracy—threatening to topple, so to speak, the “house of cards?” My suspicion is that he is referencing the latter. This is no indictment, as it represents the political posture almost by definition that presidential leadership necessitates. Admittedly, some have construed President Obama’s trust in the “better angels” of white people and his willingness to grant moral equivalence to the sufferings of white and Black people as a leadership weakness, considering America’s history of slavery and persisting racism.\n\nWhile hope is not a weakness—it is, rightly conceived, a prerequisite for rehabilitation—hope without real progress can become a recurring nightmare. As such, equally important to an accurate assessment of President Obama’s political navigation and the Civil Rights Movement’s legacy, is the question of whether race relations have actually progressed in the last sixty years, and whether, by “progressed,” we are referring to increased opportunity or decreased disparity. Prior to the events of the last eight years, with an increase in racially charged political rhetoric and the highly publicized killings of unarmed Black men and women (more recently George Floyd and Brianna Taylor), most people—specifically white and Black folks—would have answered without a second thought, “yes” to both questions. Now the answer to the first interpretation of the question, increased opportunity, is still reasonably “yes,” but the answer to the second interpretation, decreased disparity, is less certain, which begs the question of whether we are in a process of “rehabilitation” or “recidivism.” Statistically, a growing economic disparity among Blacks and whites, highly correlated with wealth indices, has been occurring for some time. While increased opportunity is measured by individual achievements, decreased disparity is measured by reference to group norms. This discrepancy in measures of progress, at least from a communitarian perspective, is a matter of national concern.\n\nAnd what of the “American identity?” It is difficult to imagine a rehabilitated American humanity that does not impact American identity—specifically, what we believe America is and what it means to be an American. Professor Cook argues that “individuals and groups have an affirmative duty to construct an understanding of themselves that does not negate other individuals and groups, but rather, nurtures common understanding, that is, a genuine awareness of spiritual oneness and human interdependency.” However, racism works to blind human beings to the invidious nature of materialism and poverty. Indeed, racism was used to justify the enslavement of Black people, but racism’s purpose was economic exploitation—namely, to enrich, via forced human enslavement, certain American institutions and individuals who have subsequently transferred these “unjust” gains intergenerationally via endowments and inherited wealth.\n\nPresently, while Congress’ designation of Juneteenth as a national holiday is incredibly significant, it falls short of apology, and thus continues to beg the question: what should we understand from the fact that there has never been a formal congressional apology for slavery? Is it unreasonable to interpret from this historical and modern fact that systems within the United States—not made by the current generation but inherited by them—have convinced a large portion of our citizenry that the enslavement of Black people was in the best interest of its African transplants, and therefore there is no need for redress, and there should be no complaints? One can only speculate. While Professor Cook points out an underlying denial of America’s true history—”a severe case of social psychosis” requiring “social atonement,”—President Obama urges “a mixture of optimism and strategic patience,” envisioning a racial progress made possible by our collective commitment to common interests, exemplified by the viability of a Black president.\n\nDr. King’s genius was “to foster a unique vision of American community, one based on love and fraternity”—utilizing the construct of the Beloved Community to foster “inward spiritual renewal and outward social reconstruction.” President Obama’s genius was the invocation, articulation, and communication of common interest across racial lines, providing an audacious hope of what America might yet become. Both Dr. King and President Obama inform us that racial redress can be enacted differently across various spheres of influence: spiritual, legal, and political, to name a few. And each is necessary—all to the exclusion of none—for the exorcism of racism in America. The next genius, I would suggest, must be communal, institutional, and organizational—not individual—and it must evoke the transformational. Namely, this genius must be comprised of a collective social, political, and legal ideological commitment to exonerate the conscience of our amalgamated American identity from the stain of racial injustice by every means available— through arts and entertainment, business and economics, faith communities, research and development, direct media, social media, law, and institutions of education and government. It must involve, within these spheres, not only ensuring that such environments are free from racial animus and seeking remediation, where needed, for prior racial injustices but also revisiting racialized storytelling norms. In other words, recasting our collective vision for an American identity that accounts for the racial realities of each of its citizens, without privileging one over another. This, I would argue, is the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement, one in which both the radical Dr. King and the liberal Dr. King have a place in humanity’s rehabilitation."
