        "text": "Many of the notions which we would usually regard as the basic ‘givens’ of our existence (including our gender identity, our individual selfhood, and the notion of literature itself) are actually fluid and unstable things, rather than fixed and reliable essences. Instead of being solidly ‘there’ in the real world of fact and experience, they are ‘socially constructed,’ that is, dependent on social and political forces and on shifting ways of seeing and thinking. In philosophical terms, all these are contingent categories (denoting a status which is temporary, provisional, ‘circumstance dependent’) rather than absolute ones (that is, fixed, immutable, etc.). Hence, no overarching fixed ‘truths’ can ever be established. -Peter Barry\n\nOne thing we can be sure of, as Bob Dylan sang, is that “the times, they are a changin’.” Yet the old adage goes, “the more things change, the more they stay the same.” Changing with the times seems inevitable, yet at the same time it is a personal choice whether we will go along willingly, shuffle our feet, or dig in our heels in resistance to the change. As Tama J. Kieves observes, “We live in crackling times. Change seems to electrify the air, in our individual lives and in the world… For most of us going through change, fear pounds on our door. Yet this discomfort brings an invitation to awaken our passion and aliveness as never before. Something larger wants to express itself in our lives. Pain often nudges our growth or illuminates where we have been holding back our true selves. Most of us seem to need a pinch of desperation to awaken our honesty and inspiration. As poet David Whyte says, ‘Absent the edge, we drown in numbness” (58). Kieves sees change as a positive thing because it opens up opportunities for personal growth. Many of us never answer the door of fear, and the result is a dulling of our passion and aliveness. The more times we ignore the knocking, the duller our lives seem to get as we “drown in numbness.” Change leaves many of us clinging to our belongings and our beliefs in white-knuckled resistance. Sometimes we would almost rather stay in a bad situation than change and face the unknown. Stephen Levine comments similarly on change, also seeing it as an opportunity. “Can we think of any pain in our life that was not caused by change? But when we deeply experience this flux we don’t recoil in fear of what might be coming but rather begin to open to how things are. We don’t get lost in fatalistic imaginings or “nothing matters” nihilism, but instead recognize that everything matters equally” (15).\n\nFor one, the assumption that “if you work hard and play by the rules, you will succeed” has proven itself false. A small portion of the nation's people control a majority of the nation's wealth. Many of us have unwittingly become serfs in an insidious psychological feudal system fueled by large corporations. Our failure to achieve and live the American dream is construed as our own fault rather than a failure of the system itself. The belief is that whatever you desire—wealth, success, fame, love, or a great body—is there for the taking. This does not jibe with the real-life experiences of most, however. For many, life does not feel like an endless string of opportunity for growth and achievement, and the notion that “anything is possible” rings false.\n\nThe assumption that “you are safe at home” has also proven untrue. Instead, it often feels like we are coming home to a second job, fraught with responsibilities, conflicting personalities, and usually under (re)paid (in kindness, appreciation, or shared good times) labor. The dramas of the family can feel just as unsafe and unhealthy as any that might happen outside the home. Home may be where the heart is, but at times it is where the heartache is as well. For many, home has become representative of failures, whether that failure takes the form of intimacy, sex, status, fulfillment, respect, love, or ambition. When, we ask ourselves, did my life become this?\n\nOur assumptions about gender and sex have certainly been shaken up over the last few decades. The opportunities afforded to women in particular have expanded dramatically, such that we have come to see women hold top positions in many fields. This has led to a dramatic expansion of gender roles, amending the categories associated with female and the feminine, as well as the male and the masculine. Gender roles for both sexes have slackened in many ways (though perhaps they have become more rigid in others). These changes have impacted sex quite profoundly. A puritanical shame and hush-hush surrounding sex has remained part of our national identity, but its shadow self—the porn star as pop icon (Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian)—is widely viewed by young women today as an acceptable vehicle into the public limelight. Feminist values, coupled with self-help aisles at Borders and the normalization of porn in mainstream culture, have left no stone unturned in terms of exploring sex as a practice, as a communication tool, and even as an instrument of power. Beyond Our Bodies, Our Selves and Revolution from Within, women's exploration of their sexuality has grown to include their partner in the discovery, as well as solo time. These days, women might more readily explore The Joy of Sex than The Joy of Cooking.\n\nIn the academy in particular, assumptions about gender and sex have evolved dramatically. Gender was determined, along with race, to be socially constructed much more so than biologically determined (Kessler 1994). This change in perception mandated the birth of intersectionality as a method for navigating and negotiating the complex interactions of various categories of identification, such as race, gender, class, sexuality, age, etc. (Crenshaw 1995). Scholars also realized the importance of understanding masculinities as it became more apparent that masculinity was not monolithic (Gardiner). Methodologies that include qualitative research, personal narrative, and feminist ideology have emerged and been found useful in myriad disciplines. Women have become a perfectly acceptable subject of study, the personal has taken its place as political, and the larger fight for the inclusion of women in the canon and the workplace has generally ceased, the battle won.\n\nAssumptions too about race have evolved both within the academy and in mainstream culture. While Martin Luther King Jr.'s inspiring dream has not yet been fully realized, we can concede that bits and pieces of it do occur far more often now than previously, moments where we can see through and beyond the lens of race, as if it really didn't signify much of anything anymore. If we choose to view the occupation of positions of power and prestige by people of color as a sure indicator of successful progress toward racial equality, we have achieved that, though even those at the peaks of American success seem to be pulling the race card. And beyond those few and far between success stories, it is difficult to overlook the realities of poor education (often caused by allegedly “race-neutral” city zoning laws) and limited opportunities (if only limited by one's education or lack thereof) that pervade Black communities, as well as the increased threat of imprisonment for a disproportionate percentage of Black men.\n\nOverall, the deep-rooted assumption of “the superiority of whites and the inferiority of Blacks” seems to be relatively unchanged, however. The select few African-Americans who make it to the top of their given field are seen as “the cream of the crop,” the rare exception (perhaps W.E.B. DuBois' prophetic “talented tenth?”), having risen in stature assumedly because of their perceived merit and their ability to transcend and/or manipulate the class implications often conflated with race. The rest of us black folk, the lore seems to imply, simply do not have what it takes to succeed. In contemporary American culture, we have witnessed dramatic success for a select few people of color, with the vast majority still struggling from within the invisible birdcage of interlocking oppressions. Black Americans are left to navigate schools, jobs, and their related social interactions with this subtext of either being exceptional or not having what it takes to succeed. This leaves us at the mercy of a positive (or at least neutral) judgment from those controlling the keys to important gateways of opportunities and advancement, for it is these individuals who confer power and access. The debilitating result for many is failure—failure to transcend race, class, and educational difference, but also failure to succeed, failure to seduce the gatekeepers and rise to the top, failure to live our dreams and our highest visions of ourselves.\n\nNo one attributes the success of select African-Americans to the contemporary assumption about Blacks, namely, that “a few of them are all right.” The rest, it seems, remain in the primitive savagery and presumed inferiority of the Jim Crow era. The overall portrayal of Black men as violent, criminal, and sexually potent still shapes our nation's beliefs, and in doing so creates a mold of black masculinity that is difficult to break. While women have benefit from the loosening of gender roles, men of all races seem to still be at the mercy of very rigid strictures regarding masculinity. For Black men, however, this is particularly devastating, because the limited range of available expressions of masculinity are often seen as directives given from within a multi-dimensional system of bias combining the prison-industrial complex, the educational system, the police and judicial systems, the media, and popular culture. All of these sectors of our culture are predisposed to disempower, ostracize, villainize, and dehumanize Black men.\n\nMany of the caricatured assumptions about Black women still exist as well. The sexualized Jezebel caricature of Black women is still apparent in popular culture, shaking her ass (but watching herself) in music videos. She has also crossed over to “reality” TV, where the sexy, angry, Black bitch is reproduced through the skillful storytelling the editors of those shows do, leaving any deeper images of Black femininity on the cutting room floor. The asexual/ sexual mammy still lurks in the homes of wealthy white women, as well as in corporate and government offices. She might be as Jamaica Kincaid was—a young Caribbean woman living with and caring for an affluent family. A walk around any of the more affluent neighborhoods in New York City on a nice afternoon will reveal many brown women pushing white children in strollers. But there are more metaphorical ways that this caricature is also evoked. For example, the idea of Condaleeza Rice in bed with George W. Bush intrigued Americans both politically and physically for a time. Many were more than willing to impose a traditional silhouette of interracial interaction over their relationship, rendering her his beloved mammy, a caregiver taking care of him and his family in the Big/White House, offering him her body in illicit sex, all the while feigning a wholesome devotion devoid of sexual longing. Black men of a certain stature have at times felt entitled to the same privileges of care and sexual availability from the Black women on their staff or in their workplace. America was shocked by the words and actions of Clarence Thomas toward Anita Hill. But more shocking were the ways in which Thomas was defended by empathetic men. Fifteen years later, Anucha Browne Sanders brings similar charges against Isaiah Thomas, head coach of the New York Knicks. While titillating, the story did little to raise awareness of or interest in the larger underlying issues at stake. One can only imagine how many women in less prominent positions face similar degradation every day.\n\nIn the face of such sad reiterations of stereotypical caricature, however, I can also see and appreciate the widened variety of options for self expression available for African-American women over the past few decades. A very small, but still significant example of this is Black hair. Black women now have a wide variety of hairstyles available to us and considered acceptable for the workplace, from weaves to braids to natural styles like dreads and afros to chemical straighteners like relaxers. This may, however, only be indicative of the co-opting of Black women into the corporate machine as a target for consumption rather than actual transcendence, for with more diverse Black hair-styles came more Black hair-care products. Even at my tender age, I can remember when major chain drug stores didn’t carry any products for Black hair, even if they were in the middle of a Black neighborhood. But, as Lisa Respers France acknowledges, “Far from being superficial, black hair and its care goes well beyond the multibillion-dollar industry it has become and is deeply rooted in African-American identity and culture” (CNN). One visit to a Black hair show and one must attest that creativity and imagination abound in terms of re-creating and celebrating the uniqueness of Black women's hair and culture, both of which no longer have much interest in emulating the constructions of femininity of and for white women. The hair shows, the church hat culture of African American women, and the many dread and natural hair websites and blogs were thriving even while white America was convinced that “The Rachel” was the choice in terms of hairstyle.\n\nTechnology has perhaps most dramatically impacted our assumptions by integrating itself quite thoroughly into our day-to-day lives, and connecting us all in new and important ways. There really do seem to be only six degrees of separation left, from Kevin Bacon or anyone else. We can talk, tweet, text, email, skype, or send photos or mp3s to distant corners of the planet. I can evite everyone to the (digital) revolution, though the invitation might end up in a spam folder. Many people have made room in their busy lives for online social networking. Technology itself even seems to be moving faster, collapsing the time it took to invent and proliferate the cellular phone, the digital calendar/Palm Pilot, caller ID, the digital camera, the hand-held gaming system, the internet, the GPS system, YouTube, and the iPod into the blink-of-an-eye combination of all of them in the iPhone and similar devices. We can now download movies directly to our television, computer, mp3 player, or phone, which is easier than getting movies in our mailbox from Netflix, which was easier than going to the local Blockbuster, which has only been around since the middle of the 80's, anyway, before which we had to actually go to a movie theater to see a film. In a time when technology makes us instantly accessible to others, and makes so much accessible to us at any given moment, it is difficult to stay in the present moment.\n\nThe past 25 years witnessed small but cumulatively significant steps toward the racial integration of the United States, giant leaps in medicine and technology, the birth (and death?) of the MTV generation (with subsequent marketing strategies), and the growing up of the baby boomer generation (with subsequent marketing strategies). We have seen the birth and evolution of reality TV, the death of what at least gave the pretense of being nonpartisan news. We have observed a boom in individualism among intellectual and liberal circles—away from Communism and away from the communal. These days, community and group-consciousness seem more often to be mistrusted than idealized. But this is met by the strong counter-force of fundamentalist Christians (as well as other fundamentalist religious groups) in America. Regardless of religious, political, or intellectual differences, however, the overall contemporary expression of individualism is underscored by a bizarre undercurrent of conformity in everything from the dress to the dreams of Americans. Even counter-cultures seem commodified these days. You can get fake Birkenstocks at Walmart and blue hair dye at CVS.\n\nYes, times have changed, but it often does not feel for the better.\n\nCornel West’s Nihilism\n\nThere is a meaninglessness in contemporary American culture that stems at least in part from the proliferation of material goods in our lives. Meaning here might be seen as non-monetary worth or value. Meaning seems to be imparted onto objects as we become more aware of them as connectors between us and others. It comes from a heightened awareness of the object itself, and a deeper relationship with that object. Objects can simply be things that populate our world, or they can connect us to our family, culture, nation, or planet. A sweater given to a man by his late grandmother might have more value to him than one made of the finest cashmere. A fish that a boy caught himself might taste that much more delicious. A woman might be more dismayed at losing her original wedding band than had she lost a more expensive ring. These things are valuable because they have a meaning imparted by the individual that stretches beyond mere function.\n\nAs Cornel West mentions in Race Matters, “American mass culture presented models of the good life principally in terms of conspicuous consumption and hedonistic indulgence” (55). Americans frequently buy indiscriminately, thinking we are entitled to anything that we can swipe a card to purchase. \"I shop, therefore I am\" is more self-evident these days than the Cartesian logic it parodies. 43% of American families spend more than they earn (MSN Money). Many people want for nothing, yet still want more things—or at least different, more expensive things. The more expensive the thing, the better it is assumed to be. There is a widely held belief that there is a product that will create a better life and-- more explicitly-- that money creates real and lasting happiness.\n\nThis explosion of consumption has been coupled with the proliferation of corporate culture into all walks of life. This combination of the passionate, not at all trivial pursuit of material items for consumption, paired with the incorporation and trademarking of our daily lives, is partially responsible for everything from the over-medicalizing and over-medicating of American people (courtesy of Pfizer and Eli Lilly) to the erosion of the American political culture (thanks to the generous donations of lobbyists for corporate interests). Our practices around consumption serve to reinforce the idea that we are not connected to others, that we are isolated. Material items are used to display freedom, to carve out freedom, to perform freedom—where freedom is seen as unlimited access with no responsibility. But what to make of this freedom- is it freedom from anonymity? To be anonymous in America today is to be powerless, voiceless, trapped. So why conform if one's true (hidden) goal to be peerless, groupless, representative only of oneself? Why does our society privilege conformity, then challenge us to stand out while still conforming?\n\nOur consumptive practices with food are among the most disturbing. It has gotten such that activities are closely associated with the foods they offer us—popcorn at movies, hot dogs at baseball games, cotton candy at carnivals, to name a few. We as a nation are so obsessed with consumption that one of our largest industries is diet and health-related products—we even consume things that are supposed to either block, inhibit, or negate our consumption! This type of food consumption has led to health problems for many. Our diet often does little to offer us balanced nutrition through reasonable quantities of food, nor does it stabilize our energy or mood. Movies like “Supersize Me” and “Fast Food Nation” demonstrate the grotesque in contemporary American cuisine.\n\nYet sometimes it is hard to believe that there are other possibilities available to us in any given moment. With our food traveling an average of 1500 miles before it reaches our plates, Americans are often so far removed from the production of the goods we consume that it feels virtually impossible to instill in that consumption some type of meaning. We often have no idea where our clothes are made, where our strawberries are grown, where our food is prepared or packaged. We don’t know who makes our clothes, who picks our strawberries, who prepares and packages our food. We have no clue what language they speak, if they are treated kindly, whether or not they go to bed hungry or fed.\n\nOur society seems to be plagued at this juncture with the nihilism that Cornel West described in Race Matters and reprised in Democracy Matters.\n\nNihilism is to be understood here not as a philosophic doctrine that there are no rational grounds for legitimate standards or authority; it is, far more, the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying meaning-lessness, hopelessness and (most important) lovelessness (22, his emphasis).\n\nThe meaninglessness that West sees in American culture stems from the prosaic repetition, the day in-day out, the over and over, the same old thing. In other words, we have cultivated practices that do little to enhance our happiness, health, or well-being. Without the change that Kieves described earlier, we drown in the numbness of same old-same old. This type of repetition creates a feeling of meaninglessness because we are not seeing the change implicit in each moment, the power, nor the beauty. We are not seeing things as they are. We frequently fix something or someone with a label (ugly/ fun/ boring/ beautiful) and do not bother to notice and observe changes in that thing or person from moment to moment over time. Many American rituals are secular, empty repetitions that do little more than wear grooves into our brains. We often mistake the rituals for the meaning itself—many see holidays such as Valentine’s Day or Christmas not as opportunities to show our loved ones how we feel or celebrate the birth of Christ, but as mandatory shopping times. This meaninglessness is not often discussed as such, but it is lived and felt.\n\nThe hopelessness comes from not knowing how to change our situation(s), not feeling in control. Although we as Americans have more freedom than many peoples on the planet right now, many of us don’t feel free. We feel constrained by obligations— many financial, others professional, some emotional— to stay the same course, to not change, to not explore other aspects of who we are. Our culture romanticizes love and success, which sends most young people scrambling after both. It is only once the love is lived, complete with its moments of loneliness and hurt, resentment and boredom, or the success is achieved, complete with its moments of competition and conniving, insincerity and insecurity, that we notice that we never got to see what “happily ever after” actually looks like. Many of us want more and better, but we can’t seem to get it.\n\nLovelessness, the third component of West’s definition of nihilism, is the result of not feeling connected to/interconnected with everything around us. In spite of the technological ease with which we can connect, our thoughts and choices frequently leave us feeling very isolated and alone, longing for human connection. “The frightening result is a numbing detachment from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world. Life without meaning, hope and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the individual and others” (23).\n\nIn Democracy Matters, West complicates this hopeless, meaningless, loveless state he described in Race Matters, linking it to a cultural ideology of “free-market fundamentalism” and observing that:\n\nThe dangerous dogma of free-market fundamentalism turns our attention away from schools to prisons, from workers’ conditions to profit margins, from health clinics to high-tech facial surgeries, from civic associations to pornographic Internet sites, and from children’s care to strip clubs. The fundamentalism of the market puts a premium on the activities of buying and selling, consuming and taking, promoting and advertising, and devalues community, compassionate charity, and the improvement of the general quality of life. How ironic that in America we’ve moved so quickly from Marin Luther King Jr.’s “Let Freedom Ring!” to “Bling! Bling!”—as if freedom were reducible to simply having material toys, as dictated by free-market fundamentalism (5).\n\nThis is an interesting point that West makes—in American culture right now, the individual’s needs are placed above those of the community. While this is true, the individual’s deeper needs are fulfilled only with the approval of the community. The individual lives in fear of the group, a fear that is taught through the culture, rather than in living in symbiotic harmony. Alexis de Tocqueville—whose work Cornel West calls “The most powerful and poignant work ever written about America” (45)—describes the insidious way that our culture threatens our individualism. \"Under the private culture monopoly it is a fact that 'tyranny leaves the body free and directs its attack at the soul. The ruler no longer says: You must think as I do or die. He says: You are free not to think as I do; your life, your property, everything shall remain yours, but from this day on you are a stranger among us'\" (133). By attacking our souls, this brand of tyranny has left us a nation of isolated individuals who fear expressing our individuality, a fear used against us by the multi-media marketing machine to sell everything from hamburgers to homes.\n\nWe want to be unique at the very moment that we realize its impossibility. We settle for exploring the limited number of combinations and permutations of what is seen as acceptable within these cultural confines. Our consumption, then, becomes a method of differentiation, a key component in our identity. Work becomes a necessary evil for sustaining one's life-style, money becomes the vehicle through which one may construct an image. West feels that the dogma of free-market fundamentalism “redefines the terms of what we should be striving for in life, glamorizing material gain, narcissistic pleasure, and the pursuit of narrow individualistic preoccupations” (4). It is precisely this “should”—a dictate from outside of our self—that takes away our freedom. Likewise, it is this reliance on culturally pre-determined markers of success or happiness that rob us of our power to be Self-defined. We are told that we are free, then goaded into participating in American culture through pre-approved, corporate-sponsored avenues.\n\nAmerican lives are now seen in terms of numbers, demographics, and dollar signs. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno assert that \"the universal criterion of merit is the amount of 'conspicuous production,' of blatant cash investment\" (124). In America, this idea can be applied to products of culture (movies, for instance, where the amount spent on making the movie is meant to indicate its merit to moviegoers, and its gross at the box office is intended to indicate its value as art), as well as people as products of culture (the amount of money spent on one's education, for instance, coded in the name-brand of the school, is meant to indicate one's merit to prospective employers and one’s entry into a fraternal bond with other graduates of the school already in the workforce). It becomes easy to see what Americans view as important and what we view as unimportant by examining how much money we give to energize it.\n\nWe prefer to see ourselves as being the controller rather than the controlled when it comes to consumerist culture. But as Thomas Merton, a Catholic monastic contemplative and writer, remarks in Contemplation in a World of Action:\n\nThough we still pay lip service to the old myth that what is good for the market is good for everybody, as a matter of fact the development of new products and the marketing of commodities has really little or nothing to do with man’s real good and his real needs. The aim is not the good of man but higher profits. Instead of production being for the sake of man, which, while proclaiming its humanism and pretending indeed to glorify man as never before, is really a systematic and almost cynical affront to man’s humanity. Man is a consumer who exists in order to keep business going by consuming its products whether he wants them or not, needs them or not, likes them or not. But in order to fulfill his role he must come to believe it. Hence his role as consumer takes the place of his identity (if any). He is then reduced to a state of permanent nonentity and tutelage in which his more or less abstract presence in society is tolerated only if he conforms, remains a smoothly functioning automaton, an uncomplaining and anonymous element in the great reality of the market (31).\n\nHow did our consumption become our identity? How did we get to this point where lives can be appraised? Nowadays it feels as if we can get an estimate on our self-worth by plugging some numbers (SAT scores, GPA's, net worth, zip code, age, weight, clothing size, credit rating) into some arbitrary and unarticulated formula. Do these numbers give meaning to life? Horkheimer and Adorno claim that numbers do give a certain meaning, in that they help group people into markets. \"Everybody must behave (as if spontaneously) in accordance with his previously determined and indexed level, and choose the category of mass product turned out for his type\" (123). Our numbers (clothing size, age, income, zip code) help determine what type of consumer we will be and what type of lives we will lead. This numbers game is symptomatic of the (false) myth of America as a meritocracy; it is also indicative of the confusing and often contradictory rhetoric of conformity and individualism which pervades American thought.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAdler, Mortimer J., and Charles Van Doren.
