        "text": "The Collins Distinguished Speakers’ series is one way the University of Oregon’s English department has three commitments: Critical cultural analysis, social justice and ethical discourse.\n\nEach of these also is reflected in the bodies of work and character content of the notable names participating in the Collins Distinguished Speakers’ lecture series.\n\nCornel West, the nationally renowned philosophy professor, social critic and political activist, is set to deliver the series' next lecture at Straub Hall. “Race Matters… A Timely Discussion on the Fabric of America” will begin at 7 p.m. Friday, April 26. The presentation is free and open to the public.\n\nWest lectures on the practice of public philosophy at Harvard University, where he has a joint appointment in the divinity school and the Department of African and African American Studies. He’s also a prolific writer whose titles include 1993’s “Race Matters” and “The Future of the Race,” which he co-wrote with Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. He co-wrote with Tavis Smiley the 2014 “The Rich and the Rest of Us: A Poverty Manifesto.”\n\nMade possible by the Collins Fund, West joins a series roster that includes award-winning essayist Laura Kipnis and thought-provoking novelist Jonathan Earl Franzen."
