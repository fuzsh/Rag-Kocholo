        "text": "Cornel West, born June 2, 1953, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a renowned American philosopher, author, political activist, and social critic. Throughout his career, he has engaged in critical thought across various disciplines, including philosophy, religion, politics, race, and culture.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nWest grew up in a working-class African American family. His grandfather was a Baptist minister, instilling in him a deep foundation in the Black Church and its tradition of prophetic social justice. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in three years and earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University.\n\nPhilosophical Foundations:\n\nWest's philosophical framework draws inspiration from diverse sources, including pragmatism, Marxism, critical race theory, and Black liberation theology. He critiques Eurocentric perspectives and champions the voices of marginalised communities, advocating for social justice and racial equality.\n\nAcademic Career and Writing:\n\nWest has held prestigious professorships at various institutions, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Union Theological Seminary. His prolific writing career spans over 20 books, addressing themes of race, democracy, education, and religion. Some of his most influential works include:\n\nRace Matters (1993): Examines the ongoing struggle for racial justice in America.\n\nDemocracy Matters (2004): Critiques the limitations of American democracy and advocates for a more inclusive and participatory model.\n\nBrother West: Living and Loving Out Loud (2009): A memoir exploring his personal and philosophical journey.\n\nBeyond Academia:\n\nWest is a powerful public intellectual who regularly engages in political commentary and activism. He co-hosted the radio programme \"Smiley and West\" with Tavis Smiley for several years, offering insightful analysis of current events. He is also a frequent speaker at public events and has participated in various social justice movements."
