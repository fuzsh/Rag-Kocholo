        "text": "One afternoon not long ago, I met Cornel West on the campus of Princeton University, where he is a professor of religion and the director of the Program in Afro-American Studies. I was unprepared for his easy informality and his instant cordiality. He greeted me as “brother,” and as we strolled along Nassau Street later he smiled and hailed numerous “brothers” and “sisters,” black and white, who greeted him as he went by. West, who grew up in a black neighborhood of Sacramento, California, seemed implausibly at home in those privileged Ivy League surroundings. True, he was by then no stranger to environments of that kind. He is an honors graduate of Harvard; he taught for a time at the Yale Divinity School; and he took his graduate degrees in philosophy at Princeton. Now, at the age of forty, he has been on its faculty since 1988, and next fall he will begin teaching at Harvard.\n\nWest is an unusual mixture of intellectual seriousness, dandyish elegance, and laid-back street sensibility. He struck me as almost an embodiment of the cultural synthesis he says he advocates in African-American life. His full-blown Afro recalled the black-awareness movement of the sixties and the early seventies. The mustache and the short beard framing his mouth gave his bespectacled face something of a resemblance to that of Malcolm X. But the rest of his grooming was radically deficient in militant imagery. A slender near-six-footer, he wore a navy-blue three-piece suit, with a brown-and-black striped tie and a white shirt. A silver watch chain dangled across the front of his vest, and a pair of jewelled cufflinks sparkled at the end of his shirtsleeves.\n\nThis, I gathered, is West’s usual form of dress. For years now, his acquaintances say, he hasn’t been seen in anything but a three-piece suit—a fact that some find puzzling in a progressive black intellectual. He’s somewhat annoyed by that response to his clothing. “I’m not the first serious black intellectual who has been fond of wearing three-piece suits,” he told me, pointing out several distinguished examples from the past. He was particularly impressed by the sartorial standard set by W. E. B. Du Bois, the foremost scholar of modern black protest. “The Victorian three-piece suit—with a clock and chain in the vest—worn by W. E. B. Du Bois not only represented the age that shaped and molded him; it also dignified his sense of intellectual vocation, a sense of rendering service by means of critical intelligence and moral action,” West wrote in “Race Matters,” his recent best-selling collection. “The shabby clothing worn by most black intellectuals these days may be seen as symbolizing their utter marginality behind the walls of academe and their sense of impotence in the wider world of American culture and politics.” And West, who is the grandson of a Baptist minister, said to me that “on a more personal level” his preference in dress also honors the tradition of eminent African-American preachers, “sustaining symbols of excellence, elegance, and dignity.”\n\nIt isn’t clear what West’s preference in automobiles seeks to honor. He drives an expensive Cadillac sedan, which once caused the local police to suspect him of trafficking in drugs. In September of 1988, within the first ten days of his joining the Princeton faculty, the police stopped and questioned him on three occasions—ostensibly because his Cadillac was cruising too slowly through streets with a speed limit of twenty-five miles an hour. That wasn’t the worst experience of the kind he had ever had. A few years earlier, while he was driving a Camaro between New York and Massachusetts, a state trooper pulled him over. “I wasn’t speeding,” West told me. “The cop peered into the car and said, ‘I see you going back and forth once a week; this is the fourth time I’ve seen you.’ That made him feel that I was dealing in cocaine. I said to him, ‘You’ve been seeing me that often because I teach at Williams College once a week. I’m a professor of philosophy and religion.’ ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘and I’m the Flying Nun. Let’s go, nigger.’ It was a moment that reminded me how much race does indeed matter in our society.”\n\nFor the past three or four years—mainly because of his speeches, writings, and media interviews on a wide range of social issues—West has been one of the most talked-about academics in the United States. But that sort of popularity hasn’t enhanced his standing among fellow-academics; and professional philosophers, particularly, are now sharply divided in their estimate of his intellectual purity.\n\nMembers of one faction, incredulous that a trained philosopher could be celebrated outside their arcane discipline, have become skeptical of West’s stature as a serious scholar. He spreads himself too thin, they argue. He’s an advocate in too many popular courts. His message is much too accessible to nonacademic constituencies, Richard Rorty, a former philosophy professor at Princeton (now at the University of Virginia), who doesn’t share the anti-West animus, has written, “West’s fellow philosophers usually regard him . . . as someone who has wandered so far outside his academic discipline that he no longer counts as a member of it.”\n\nRichard Bernstein, the chairman of the Philosophy Department of the New School for Social Research, is another who counts himself among the pro-West faction. “Cornel is a kind of universalist, and, at the same time, one who is absolutely committed to his black Baptist roots,” he told me a few months ago. “A number of us admire him for that. We think it’s necessary to break out of this tradition where philosophers talk mostly to themselves and write only for one another. It’s easy to take potshots at West for being in too big a soup. But it’s hard to be what he’s trying to be and still retain your integrity, and he does that.” Sheldon Wolin, who taught West political philosophy at Princeton, agrees. He thinks that West “has a highly sophisticated sense of how to negotiate the minefield he has chosen to tread, how to do it with grace and yet remain true to his beliefs.”\n\nAn unbiased look at the bulk of West’s writings (he has written nine books and co-edited three others) might reveal not that he has wandered far outside the philosophical discipline but that he has been trying to broaden the ways in which it has usually been viewed and applied. West calls himself, among other things, a religious and intellectual freedom fighter. Partly because of his experience as an African-American, he regards philosophy as a weapon that should be used in the arena of social action—to clarify issues and to help build progressive alliances across racial lines. Appearing on the PBS show “Bill Moyers’ World of Ideas” in 1990, West said, “I understand the vocation of the intellectual as trying to turn easy answers into critical questions, and ask these critical questions to those with power.” He added, “The quest for truth, the quest for the good, the quest for the beautiful, for me, presupposes allowing suffering to speak, allowing victims to be visible, and allowing social misery to be put on the agenda of those with power.”\n\nMembers of West’s professional discipline who understand the universalist role he has been attempting to play recognize him as a rare contemporary example of the philosopher who functions creatively outside the university, as a public intellectual—one deeply involved with the social and political elements of his society. In that context, he recalls such philosophers as John Dewey, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Sidney Hook, whose voices reached beyond the academy to help shape and influence the public debates of their time. Ronald F. Thiemann, the dean of Harvard’s Divinity School, has said, “West is the only person on the intellectual scene capable of inheriting the mantle of Reinhold Niebuhr.” Richard Bernstein says, “West is a black John Dewey, in the sense that Dewey was a serious thinker who spoke to the issues of the day—a model that has been sorely missing from the American scene. In an earlier progressive era, Dewey could be a professional philosopher as well as a widely read writer in magazines like *The New Republic *and The Nation. West aspires to such a model. And while doing so he shares a deep commitment to radical democracy, transcending what’s called the politics of identity or the politics of difference.”\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr., the chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department at Harvard, has called West “the preëminent African-American intellectual of our generation.” There’s nothing like such an evaluation to bring lurking dissenters out of the shadows, even as it gladdens the hearts of supporters. One who is gladdened by it is Martin Kilson, a black professor of government at Harvard. He told me last summer, “West has done several things over the past decade or so to warrant that ranking. He has single-handedly fashioned a viable transracial style of intellectual discourse.”\n\nThe dissenters, however, discern no great intellectual excellence in West, let alone preëminence. Two years ago, the political scientist Adolph Reed was quoted by the writer Robert Boynton as saying, “Cornel’s work tends to be a thousand miles wide and about two inches deep.” The iconoclastic author and critic Stanley Crouch, whose most recent book is entitled “Notes of a Hanging Judge,” doesn’t seem to know quite what to make of West. Crouch told Norman Atkins, of the New York Observer, last June, “West is clearly a smart guy, in high command of speaking skills, but I haven’t been able to ascertain the substance of what he has to say.”\n\nHenry Louis Gates’s glowing estimate of West’s intellectual stature takes into account, among other things, the conception of Afro-American studies that West has brought to the program he directs at Princeton. Regarded as one of the best of its kind in the nation (though, like him, it isn’t without hostile critics), West’s program emphasizes a cosmopolitan core of cultural and historical studies—in what could be called a heretical defiance of the current demand on many campuses for an Afrocentric curriculum. In “Race Matters” West, who abhors almost all forms of chauvinism and xenophobia, writes, “Afrocentrism, a contemporary species of black nationalism, is a gallant yet misguided attempt to define an African identity in a white society perceived to be hostile. . . . It is misguided because—out of fear of cultural hybridization and through silence on the issue of class, retrograde views on black women, gay men, and lesbians, and a reluctance to link race to the common good—it reinforces the narrow discussions about race.”\n\nOn our walk in Princeton, West was carrying the premiere issue of Vibe, a recently launched magazine of popular culture, mostly music. The issue featured an interview with him, and he wanted to make copies of it for some of his colleagues. West isn’t shy about spreading any good word about himself, and it evidently pleased him to think that he was probably the only living philosopher in whom a magazine like Vibe would take an interest. Moreover, he is probably the only American philosopher capable of discoursing as enthusiastically on jazz, rap, hip-hop, and the blues as on Marx and Hegel and Kierkegaard and Dewey.\n\nAbout rap and its appeal to a new generation of blacks, West said to me, “The old music can no longer sustain the rituals of everyday life among young inner-city people. Rap, a form of the new music, does. It’s an extension of the improvisational tradition in jazz—a union of the rhetorical and the musical. And it’s a form the young can commune with in their own way. I don’t believe that jazz and the blues can ever be as popular among the young as rap and its related forms are now.”\n\nWest was flattered by the title of the Vibe article, “Cornel U.,” but disconcerted by its subtitle, “Brother West, the hottest black academic in America, is acting out the role that’s been written for Malcolm X since his death.” That wasn’t the role he imagined himself to be playing, he told me. He was neither continuing Malcolm’s work on earth nor promoting any particular strain of race leadership. What he saw himself to be undertaking was a kind of prophetic social criticism—or “prophetic pragmatism”—based on his conviction that criticism is most effective when it transcends narrow categories of religious, cultural, and political belief.\n\nWest’s reputation as a scholarly writer rests mainly upon two books, “The American Evasion of Philosophy” (1989) and “The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought” (1991). The former traces and evaluates the genealogy of American pragmatism, from its vague origins in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson through its development and refinement in the ideas of pragmatist thinkers like Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey, the man in whose work West sees a full flowering of that relatively new philosophy. The “Evasion” of his title refers primarily to the abandonment in America of the prevailing European system of philosophical inquiry—abstract speculations about the nature of truth and reality—in favor of a method that emphasized empirical and experimental investigation. The American school of philosophy examined notions of truth and reality chiefly for their verifiable consequences in everyday life and for practical ways in which they might be applied to causes of social change and human progress.\n\n“The distinctive appeal of American pragmatism in our postmodern moment is its unashamedly moral emphasis and its unequivocally ameliorative impulse,” West writes—an emphasis and an impulse with which he associates such modern cultural and political intellectuals as Lionel Trilling and C. Wright Mills as well as Sidney Hook and W. E. B. Du Bois. He is here recognizing American pragmatism mainly as it was exemplified by Dewey, who, as teacher and public spokesman, made it an instrument in his advocacy of social and educational reform. “Dewey isn’t just the greatest American philosopher,” West told me over lunch in Princeton. “He is the great New World philosopher, in trying to meet the challenge of historical consciousness while preserving the democratic enterprise.” It is in Dewey’s example that West roots the “prophetic pragmatism” that he himself practices in the social criticism that has caused hard-nosed specialists in analytic philosophy to sneer at the role he plays as a public intellectual. Richard Rorty, who is also a student of Dewey’s philosophy, isn’t one to sneer at such a role. Reviewing “The American Evasion” not long after it appeared, Rorty wrote, “West may be (thanks to his connections with the black churches) the closest thing to an ‘organic intellectual’ my country has these days, and may thus be . . . as likely a source of specific, concrete, patriotic, prophetic vision as anybody around.”\n\nIn “The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought”—a revised and updated version of his doctoral dissertation, “Ethics, Historicism, and the Marxist Tradition”—West attempts a restorative reappraisal of the Marxist social critique, particularly in the light of the hard times it has been falling upon around the world. His aim, he states, is to defend “the relevance of Marxist thought, including its ethical dimensions, after the Cold War.” That is very much how the book has been read by academic intellectuals who understand or endorse its objective, one of whom is Alison Jaggar, a professor of philosophy and women’s studies at the University of Colorado. In a symposium sponsored by the independent socialist journal Monthly Review, Jaggar stated that West’s text “is published at this time not just with the scholarly intention of countering vulgar reductionist readings of Marx but with the directly political intention of rehabilitating the Marxist project of understanding the world in order to change it.”\n\nPartly because of the intention behind “The Ethical Dimensions,” some have wondered whether West isn’t really a Marxist, fellow-travelling under the misleading colors of John Dewey’s ameliorative pragmatism. Others have wondered how an aggressively believing Christian could testify so faithfully on behalf of a doctrine as ungodly as Marxism. West finds more than a slight philosophical connection between Marxism and pragmatism, but it is one that only he could properly explain. At any rate, he isn’t a Marxist, only a serious student of Marx’s social analysis. In “The Ethical Dimensions” he declares:\n\nI am a non-Marxist socialist in that as a Christian, I recognize certain irreconcilable differences between Marxists of whatever sort and Christians of whatever sort. . . . My Christian perspective—mediated by the rich traditions of the Black Church that produced and sustains me—embraces depths of despair, layers of dread . . . and ungrounded leaps of faith alien to the Marxist tradition. . . . The Marxist tradition is silent about the existential meaning of death, suffering, love, and friendship owing to its preoccupation with improving the social circumstances under which people pursue love, revel in friendship, and confront death.\n\nMuch of the public interest that West has been generating of late springs from the popular reception accorded “Race Matters,” his first book addressed to a general audience. It was published by Beacon Press last spring to coincide with the first anniversary of the rioting in Los Angeles. But, in an argument characteristic of its irreverent approach, “Race Matters” takes the position that “what happened in Los Angeles in April of 1992 was neither a race riot nor a class rebellion.” West argues:\n\nThis monumental upheaval was a multiracial, trans-class, and largely male display of justified social rage. . . . It signified the sense of powerlessness in American society . . . What we witnessed in Los Angeles was the consequence of a lethal linkage of economic decline, cultural decay, and political lethargy in American life. Race was the visible catalyst, not the underlying cause.\n\nThat may not correspond with the general view of what took place in Los Angeles, but it reflects the critical angle from which West often looks at social problems and which gives him a perspective that combines Christian idealism, “prophetic pragmatism,” democratic socialism, and Marxist analysis.\n\nHe expresses the opinion in “Race Matters” that there has been a widespread social breakdown in America, much of it having to do with the status of blacks, and particularly the poor. “We must delve into the depths where neither liberals nor conservatives dare to tread,” West urges, “into the murky waters of despair and dread that now flood the streets of black America.” He cites “the depressing statistics of unemployment, infant mortality, incarceration, teenage pregnancy, and violent crime”; “the monumental eclipse of hope”; and “the unprecedented collapse of meaning.” He finds little to choose between, on the one hand, “the liberal notion that more government programs can solve racial problems” and, on the other, “the conservative idea that what is needed is a change in the moral behavior of poor black urban dwellers.”\n\nYet the author is no less scathing in his analysis of black leaders and the black intelligentsia. “West can be critical of his black brothers in ways that other people can’t be, because they are accused of being racist if they are critical,” Richard Bernstein told me. And “Race Matters” is indeed a rare example of unsparing black self-criticism.\n\nOn the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court: “Few [black leaders] had the courage to say publicly that this was an act of cynical tokenism concealed by outright lies about Thomas being the most qualified candidate regardless of race.” That silence showed that it is “racial” rather than “moral” reasoning that “regulates black thought and action.”\n\nOn black political and intellectual leadership: “There has not been a time in the history of black people in this country when the quantity of politicians and intellectuals was so great, yet the quality of both groups has been so low. . . . Most present-day black political leaders appear too hungry for status to be angry, too eager for acceptance to be bold, too self invested in advancement to be defiant.”\n\nOn black conservatives’ attack upon affirmative action: “If I had been old enough to join the fight for racial equality . . . in the 1960s . . . I would have favored—as I do now—a class-based affirmative action in principle. . . . The prevailing discriminatory practices during the sixties, whose targets were working people, women, and people of color, were atrocious.”\n\nStill, West isn’t without hope for a moral and social recovery, for a progressive multiracial American future. In “Race Matters” he goes on to suggest, “To establish a new framework, we need to begin with a frank acknowledgment of the basic humanness and Americanness of each of us,” for “if we go down, we go down together.”\n\nLaudatory reviews and a fifteen-city promotional tour helped put “Race Matters” on a number of best-seller lists across the country. It arrived on the *Times *list in June and stayed there almost continuously until late August; and Beacon Press tells me that nearly a hundred thousand copies are in print. Surprised by so favorable a reaction to so querulous a book, West can think of only one reason for its critical and commercial success. “A lot of readers have been as provoked by it as they have been disturbed by it,” he says.\n\nHe doesn’t feel, however, that “Race Matters” delivers the authoritative word on its subject. “My voice in it isn’t a definitive voice,” he told me. “I can imagine many readers asking me, ‘O.K., what’s your panacea, what’s your solution?’ My answer is that I’m just trying to establish a framework within which we can come together for dialogue, an open-ended conversation within which other constructive voices might emerge.”\n\nOne of the problems with trying to be a synthesizer, West has found—particularly in his effort to help mend the broken alliance between Jews and African-Americans—is that “you’re often misperceived by one side or the other to be a centrist, having no position of your own.” A centrist West surely isn’t. Although he seldom publicizes his political affiliation, he is basically a democratic socialist. He sits on the editorial board of* Dissent*, a quarterly journal of democratic-socialist opinion that was founded (and edited for almost all its forty years) by the literary and social critic Irving Howe, who died last May. West’s colleagues on the Dissent board included Michael Harrington, who, until his death, in 1989, was a major spokesman for the democratic left. He is also an honorary chairman of Democratic Socialists of America, which Harrington founded in the early eighties, and which, West says, “was the first multiracial socialist organization close enough to my kind of politics that I could join.”\n\nHe felt a deep admiration for Howe and Harrington, both of whom were academic intellectuals as well as activists. “Their quality of mind came from a subculture of relentless critical engagement,” he told me. “They weren’t devoured by the academy. Their conversations were partly inside and partly outside, so that they were able to think synthetically, to form a sense of the whole. Like Edmund Wilson, they moved agilely from one issue to another, without being encumbered by specialization. Democratic socialism is their great tradition, and I do feel a bond of solidarity with it. But I also feel a bond with the feminist and womanist community, with the anti-homophobic community, with those in the black-freedom struggle who are open to the issues of class and gender. In that sense, progressive black nationalists are also comrades of mine.”\n\nLike two of the older black intellectuals he admires—the novelist, essayist Ralph Ellison and the historian John Hope Franklin—Cornel West is a native of Oklahoma. He was born in Tulsa, on June 2, 1953, and grew up in Sacramento, where his family had settled in 1958, after a brief sojourn in Topeka, Kansas. His mother (a schoolteacher) and father (an Air Force civil servant) reared their two daughters and two sons in the church: first at Metropolitan Baptist in Tulsa and later at Shiloh Baptist in Sacramento. Metropolitan Baptist’s pastor in the fifties was West’s grandfather, the Reverend Clifton L. West, and his given name has passed down to Cornel’s father, Cornel’s older brother, and Cornel’s sixteen-year-old son (from the first of three marriages). West wrote in 1991 that “the most significant stage-setting for my own life pilgrimage” was his “closely knit family and overlapping communities of church and friends,” and that the “Christian outlook” served as “the basis for my life vocation.”\n\n“Cornel was an energetic youngster,” his brother, Clifton, told me recently. “At home, he was a loving child, but in the streets he got into a lot of fights. He was tart-tongued. He said whatever came into his mind. It was some time before he learned to couch things in acceptable terms. Because of an asthmatic condition, which he later outgrew, he had a wiry build, but he was well coordinated, and he thought nobody could whip him. While I wouldn’t say he was a bully, he surely had his way of dispensing justice.\n\n“And he was a leader. At Camellia Elementary School, he led a gang of male classmates, all of whom revered him. One morning, he said to them, ‘Look, you all can stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance if you want to, don’t let me stop you. But I won’t be standing up. I’m finished with that sort of thing.’ They said, ‘Corn, if you aren’t going to salute the flag, then none of us will be standing up this morning.” And so it was. None of them stood up. A teacher recognized Corn to be the ringleader. She walked up to him and demanded to know, ‘Why do you refuse to salute the flag?’ He said to her, ‘My people have always gone abroad to fight for this country, and every one of them has come back home to second-class citizenship. The flag doesn’t represent me.’ The teacher slapped him, and Corn got up and punched her in the face. He was suspended from Camellia, and sent to the Earl Warren School, in another part of town. It was an accelerated school, and when he got there he began taking his academic studies more seriously.”\n\nIn addition to church and school, West was also captivated by the Black Panther Party, whose Sacramento office was around the corner from Shiloh Baptist Church. West was attracted to the Panthers not only for their racial militancy but also for the charitable community programs they organized on behalf of the black poor. It was during his street-corner discussions with them that he first heard of Karl Marx, a name he associated with service to the downtrodden. But he soon discovered that he couldn’t be wholly drawn to the Panthers; he couldn’t give up his religious faith for their grass-roots Marxism. Besides, he was partly repelled by their hostility toward the black church and their total contempt for the Christian ministry.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, when West graduated from John F. Kennedy High School—where he was president of the student body—he won a scholarship to Harvard. “In 1970, when I entered Harvard College, I became part of the first generation of young black people to attend prestigious lily-white institutions of higher learning in significant numbers—institutions still coping with the new wave of Jewish faculty and students who had confronted an earlier tribal civility, snobbish gentility, and institutional loyalty of primarily well-to-do white Anglo-Saxon Protestants,” West has written. “Owing to my family, church, and the black social movements of the 1960s, I arrived at Harvard unashamed of my African, Christian, and militant decolonized outlooks. More pointedly, I acknowledged and accented the empowerment of my black styles, mannerisms, and viewpoints.”\n\nMartin Kilson was at first baffled by West’s mélange of styles and mannerisms and viewpoints. He couldn’t quite resolve what he saw as a “dissonance” between West’s “sharp, cogent, and vigorous intellect” and “a ghetto-hip street-corner persona.” Kilson thought that West was “indulging in a put-on,” he told me. “And I remember feeling that several years at Harvard would mainstream Cornel’s street-corner demeanor. Well, it turned out that he wasn’t putting on at all. The dissonance in his manner was a disciplined facet of a very bright student. He came to Harvard with an already well-shaped progressive mindset—freethinking, nondoctrinaire, and yet firm.”\n\nWest graduated in three years, magna cum laude, and, with some trepidation, went on to Princeton for postgraduate studies in philosophy. Because Princeton’s Philosophy Department, then considered the best in the nation, was known for its intellectual rigor, he feared, he later wrote, that his Christian faith would be undermined “by the powerful tools of analytical philosophy.” His fears were unwarranted. He soon discovered that none of his professors “cared about religious faith—though Walter Kaufmann and Richard Rorty regarded the issue with historic curiosity.” According to Sheldon Wolin, who was the chairman of the program in political philosophy, West “made a strong impression as a graduate student.” Princeton philosophy, Wolin told me, “is demanding to the point of neurotic preciosity, but Cornel resisted its narrowness, and the more relaxed atmosphere of the political-philosophy program allowed his natural curiosity to determine the direction of his concerns, rather than the professional stamp of a conventional discipline.”\n\nWest’s first teaching appointment—in 1977, while he was completing his doctoral dissertation—was as an assistant professor of philosophy and religion at Union Theological Seminary, in New York. He wanted to teach at Union, he later wrote, because it was “the center of liberation theology,” was “one of the best places for black theological education,” and was “the perfect place to become a broadly engaged cultural critic with a strong grounding in the history of philosophy and criticism.”\n\nIn 1984, he was lured away from Union Theological Seminary by the offer of a full professorship in religion and philosophy at the Yale Divinity School. He returned to Union in 1987, and by that time, he has written, “my faith was tested and deepened, my mind was stretched and refined, my soul was refreshed and readied for battle.” He hoped to wage that battle from a permanent base at Union Theological.\n\nIn 1988, Princeton University asked West to join its faculty as a professor of religion and the director of its program in Afro-American studies. It wasn’t the most opportune time for such an invitation, and initially West had no interest in the offer. “I had settled my heart upon Union,” he told me. “That’s where I wanted to be. Its tradition of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich was very important to me. It still is. There’s a sense in which a seminary sits at the center of my institutional identity. I thought I was going to be at Union for the rest of my life, helping to build upon its tradition.”\n\nBut his two closest friends told him that the Princeton appointment might be too important to refuse. One was James Washington, a professor of church history at Union. The other was his brother, Clifton, in Sacramento, who works in the computer-software industry. “In a fundamental way, I’m a footnote to my brother,” Cornel says. “He’s three years older, shared his lessons with me, and taught me much of what I knew when I was young. So that my style is similar to his. He’s not a professional intellectual, but he’s a wise man. In terms of love and sensibility and compassion, we are very similar.”\n\nAnd, in the end, West could not resist the entreaty of Ruth Simmons, who was then the associate dean of faculty and is now the vice-provost. “When I came to Princeton, our program in Afro-American studies was floundering,” Simmons told me some time ago. “It had been in place since 1970, but it hadn’t achieved the level of distinction expected of Princeton. Many scholars, within and outside Princeton, advised me that Cornel was my best candidate.” Still, West says, the novelist Toni Morrison, who is a professor of the humanities at Princeton, was “the major force” in his decision to go to Princeton. “She told me in one of our talks that she wanted me to become a part of her ‘intellectual neighborhood.’ ” He was won by “that lovely formulation.”\n\nUnder West’s guidance, Princeton’s program has become preëminent. “We knew when we hired Cornel that he would provide intellectual excitement, and that has turned out to be true,” Ruth Simmons said.\n\nOn a second visit to Princeton, I found West in Dickinson Hall. That building, named for the Reverend Jonathan Dickinson, the first president of the university (when it was still called the College of New Jersey), houses the Program in Afro-American Studies, and West has one of many small offices on the ground floor. Dressed in his usual fashion, he was sitting at his desk, poring over papers and smoking a cigarillo. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lining the walls were crammed with works in history, philosophy, religion, political theory, biography, music, architecture, fiction, poetry, literary criticism, and other subjects that filled out the range of his eclectic interests.\n\nAt one point in our talk, I asked him what quality in his Afro-American-studies program caused it to be so highly regarded in academic circles across the country.\n\n“I think it has to do with the fact that at Princeton black voices are fully integrated with the high-quality intellectual conversation taking place on campus,” he said. “Black studies isn’t viewed here as some ghettoized or marginalized subject. It isn’t an afterthought, something just added on to the discussion of what it means to be an American. We put black subject matter, in all its forms, at the center of the wider cultural conversation, so that we can see it as a whole—the Afro-American relationship to all of the New World.”\n\nWest’s cosmopolitan approach has its hostile critics among black intellectuals, none more outspoken than Molefi Asante, who directs the African-American Studies Program at Temple University. I asked West what he thought of a passage that appeared in a recent issue of the Washington Post’s Sunday magazine:\n\nAsante . . . the very architect of “Afrocentricity” as a philosophic mode, says he has included a critique of West in his own upcoming book on race. . . .\n\nAsante belittles West’s “unnecessary eclecticism,” . . . his fundamentally “assimilationist” orientation. “We [Afrocentrists] claim that there is nothing more correct for African-American people than our experiences, if we learn from them,” Asante says. “Our solutions are within ourselves, not outside of us.” He believes West “finds his intellectual center in white tradition. He has been educated away from himself.”\n\n“At a very deep level, Asante and I have clashing intellectual temperaments,” West told me. “For him, notions of a solid and centered identity are positive. I revel in fluidity, in improvisation, in the highly complicated and paradoxical. Asante and I agree in our critiques of white supremacy; we agree in speaking to issues of self-love and self-respect among people of African descent. We end there. He advocates a conception of self that is grounded in a unified field of African culture. But that way of framing the question is alien to me. I’m not for a solid anything. I begin with radical cultural hybridity, an improvisational New World sensibility. I always think that we are in process, making and remaking ourselves along the way. I see it in Louis Armstrong, I see it in Sarah Vaughan, I see it in Emerson’s essays, I see it in Whitman’s poetry about democratic vistas.\n\n“I would point out to Asante that there is nothing wrong with affirming African humanity if we recognize that African civilizations, like European civilizations, have an ambiguous legacy—barbarism on the one hand and humanism on the other. I think this experiment called America does have a distinctiveness. There are some wonderful things about it, and there are some ugly things about it. And my aim is to keep those two motifs in my head at the same time.”\n\nBut West now finds himself wrestling with the dual claims of his African-Americanness: whether and when he might leave the United States and take up residence in Africa. His wife, Elleni Gebre Amlak, to whom (”the love of my life”) he dedicates his latest book of essays, “Keeping Faith,” is a native of Ethiopia. At their wedding celebration, in Addis Ababa two years ago, West received an honorary Ethiopian name, Fikre Selassie. Elleni’s mother transferred ownership of the ancestral house to her daughter and new son; and West now spends a part of each year in Addis Ababa. Feeling more and more like an adopted Ethiopian, he is as drawn to a future life in his wife’s birthplace as he is held by the counter-pull of his American homeland. In “Keeping Faith” he writes, “My initiation into Ethiopian life raises urgent issues of inheritance and rootlessness, tradition and homelessness. What is my relation to my African heritage and Ethiopian house? How do I understand my African American tradition and sense of black homelessness in America?”\n\nBefore ending our talk in Dickinson Hall, West brought up another question he hadn’t resolved at that time: whether he might leave Princeton for Harvard. He said he had received an offer from Harvard—to teach in the Divinity School and in the Department of Afro-American Studies—and that it was very tempting. West made up his mind some weeks after our conversation, and I called him last November, after reading that he had accepted the joint appointment as professor of Afro-American studies and the philosophy of religion. “Princeton and Harvard are both fine places, but Harvard is a larger context, in which I can have a broader intellectual impact,” he said.\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr., told me later, “I think the chief attraction that Harvard had for Cornel was the fact that it’s such a multiplex kind of institution—with the Law School, the Business School, the Education School, the Kennedy School of Government. It’s a dozen institutions in one, and that means there’s a forum for Cornel to make his presence felt across a variety of fields, interests, and constituencies. Cornel is someone who isn’t bounded by the traditional demarcation of disciplines; he has thoughtful views about legal training, education, governance, you name it. So it isn’t just a matter of joining one school or department but having access to an academic equivalent of a teeming metropolis. Having said that, I have no doubt that he represents the real, and long-delayed, maturation of the Afro-American Studies Department, a scholar in whom skepticism and engagement come together. And, of course, he’s an inspiring teacher. By the same token, Cornel is someone who derives a lot of stimulation from colleagues, and there’s no paucity of that sort of stimulation here, so it’s clear that he will thrive.” ♦"
