        "text": "The following report gives a critical analysis of Dr. Cornel West’s book, “Race Matters.” In his book, Dr. West, a scholar, theologian, and activist, presents key issues of the day (1990s) primarily relating to race. He wrote “Race Matters” following the Los Angeles riot of 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers involved in the tragic beating of Rodney King. The book was originally published in April 1993 by New York: Vintage Books. This book is comprised of eight separate essays focusing primarily on racial issues relative to current events, the political climate, and market forces. Dr. West’s basic argument is that race matters in all aspects of American culture as well as abroad. He attempts to raise the awareness of his readers (and audiences) about the importance of race as an integral part of American society.\n\nIn addressing the Los Angeles riot, Dr. West, wrote, “The riot of April 1992 was, neither a race riot, nor a class rebellion, rather, this monumental upheaval was a multiracial, trans-class, and largely male display of justified social rage.” These events were unfortunate, and attempts were made by ‘the powers that be’ to blame them on “the black underclass, the action of criminal hoodlums, or the political revolt of the oppressed urban masses miss the mark.” Instead, Dr. West attributed the cause to: economic decline, cultural decay, and political lethargy in American life. He stated, “Race was the visible catalyst, not the underlying cause.”\n\nThe above-mentioned essays are: Nihilism in Black America, The Pitfalls of Racial Reasoning, The Crisis of Black Leadership, Demystifying the Black Conservatism, Beyond Affirmative Action: Equality and Identity, On Black-Jewish Relations, Black Sexuality: T...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...elves through white lenses. Malcolm X contended that “the only legitimate response to white supremacy ideology and practice is black self-love and black self-determination free of the tension generated by ‘double-consciousness.’ I concur with Dr. West’s view of Malcolm X and believe if had lived longer he would have effected major changes in the black community.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. West did an incredible job in his book. He clearly displayed, not only that race matters, but how and why it matters. It should serve as a reference on key racial issues for all parties dealing with race per se. My question and thesis concerned Dr. West’s ability to enhance my knowledge of how race matters. He did so in a way that I will always remember. I know, through the essays/book, how race impacts my life, others, African American Politics, and American society as a whole."
