        "text": "Cornel West has had a long and distinguished career as a philosopher, author, and activist. After earning his PhD from Princeton, West taught philosophy at several universities, including Union Theological Seminary, Yale University, and Harvard University. He has also been a visiting professor at several other institutions, including the University of Paris and the University of Amsterdam.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, West has also been a prominent activist and public intellectual. He has been a vocal critic of racial injustice and has worked tirelessly to promote equality and democracy in America. West has written numerous books on a wide range of topics, including philosophy, politics, and race relations. He has also been a frequent commentator on television and radio, and he has appeared on programs such as The Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nOne of Cornel West’s most influential works is his book Race Matters, which was first published in 1993. The book is a collection of essays that explore the role of race in American society and the challenges faced by African Americans. Race Matters was a critical and commercial success and helped to bring issues of race and racism to the forefront of American public discourse.\n\nIn Race Matters, West argues that America is a deeply divided society, and that race is at the root of this division. He also argues that racism is a pervasive and insidious force in American society, and that it must be confronted and overcome if America is to achieve true equality and democracy.\n\nRace Matters was the book which solidified West’s role as a prominent public intellectual, but the book also exposed West’s deep discomfort and complete misunderstanding of Black Nationalism. Most of West’s critique of Black Nationalism in Race Matters comes from a misunderstanding of the Black Nationalists. Much of his assessment also lacks historical context. For example, West writes that “the grand legacy of Marcus Garvey forces us never to forget that black self-love and black self-respect sit at the center of any possible black freedom movement. Yet this does not mean that we must talk about black self-love and black self-respect in the way in which Garvey did, that is, on an imperial model in which black armies and navies signify black power.”\n\nGarvey spoke of black armies and black navies because of the specific challenges that he dealt with. At the time Africa was colonized by European imperialists and Garvey recognized that the Europeans would not give up their African colonies without an armed fight. This became especially apparent when Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia. The first Italian invasion of Ethiopia was successfully repelled, but Ethiopia was not able to repel the second invasion. Garvey recognized that armed struggle would have been necessary to liberate Africa, which is why he explained: “The U.N.I.A. is preparing to go the way of all other peoples who have fought for liberty. We are preparing to go the way of George Washington and the noble patriots of this great country. It is the way of the sword and blood.”\n\nLiberation for African nations such as Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa involved armed struggle and bloodshed, as Garvey had predicted. In writing about Garvey’s emphasis on black armies and navies West completely neglects the historical context behind why Garvey placed so much focus on building up military power and neglects to mention that it did require military struggle to liberate many parts of Africa. By neglecting to mention this West is able to slyly represent Garvey’s position as being somehow misguided or unnecessary, when the fact is that Garvey’s position was very much necessary for the situation that he was dealing with. Black armies signified black power for Garvey because such armies were necessary to protect the interests of African people.\n\nWest’s treatment of Malcolm X involves similar distortions. For example, he spends much time assessing what he describes as Malcolm’s fear of “cultural hybridity” in the United States. The issue is not so much that Malcolm feared cultural hybridity. The issue was that it was irrelevant for him. What would have been the point of focusing on the hybrid nature of African American culture, when as Malcolm explained, African Americans were treated as second class citizens. Malcolm explained:\n\nTen men can be sitting at a table eating, you know, dining, and I can come and sit down where they’re dining. They’re dining; I’ve got a plate in front of me, but nothing is on it. Because all of us are sitting at the same table, are all of us diners? I’m not a diner until you let me dine. Then I become a diner. Just being at the table with others who are dining doesn’t make me a diner, and this is what you’ve got to get in your head here in this country.\n\nJust because you’re in this country doesn’t make you an American. No, you’ve got to go farther than that before you can become an American. You’ve got to enjoy the fruits of Americanism. You haven’t enjoyed those fruits. You’ve enjoyed the thorns. You’ve enjoyed the thistles. But you have not enjoyed the fruits, no sir. You have fought harder for the fruits than the white man has. You have worked harder for the fruits than the white man has, but you’ve enjoyed less. When the man put the uniform on you and sent you abroad, you fought harder than they did. Yeah, I know you — when you’re fighting for them, you can fight.\n\nMalcolm correctly recognized that the problem was that African Americans were not truly Americans, otherwise there would have never been a need for civil rights legislation in the first place. West writes that one “would think that Malcolm X’s second conversion, in 1964, to Orthodox Islam might have allayed his fear of cultural hybridity.” Why? Malcolm himself explained that his views on religion and race changed, but American society did not change. He explained: “But despite the fact that I saw that Islam was a religion of brotherhood, I also had to face reality. And when I got back into this American society, I’m not in a society that practices brotherhood. I’m in a society that might preach it on Sunday, but they don’t practice it on no day — on any day.”\n\nMalcolm was not concerned about any notions of a hybrid culture because he was confronted with the reality of African suffering in America. West also seems to misunderstand certain aspects of Malcolm’s conversion. For example, West writes that for Malcolm “the most striking feature of these Islamic regimes was not their undemocratic practices but rather their acceptance of his black humanity.” West continues to explain that Malcolm “remained blind to basic structures of domination based on class, gender, and sexual orientation in the Middle East.”\n\nMalcolm certainly was not blind to the fact that Arabs had been just as repressive of African people as Europeans had been which is why he publicly expressed his support for the revolution that overthrew Arab rule in Zanzibar. Moreover, Malcolm also expressed disappointment that Arab Muslims had not done more to support the struggles of African Americans. In an interview with Al-Muslimoon Malcolm was questioned on why it was that he still held “the Black color as a main base and dogma” for the struggle that he was engaged in. Malcolm replied by pointing out that African Americans were oppressed precisely because of their color. Malcolm further explained: “Much to my dismay, until now, the Muslim world has seemed to ignore the problem of the Black American, and most Muslims who come here from the Muslim world have concentrated more effort in trying to convert white Americans than Black Americans.”\n\nIn that interview Malcolm also pointed out that he noticed strong anti-Arab feelings in West Africa. He also felt that it was primarily the responsibility of the Arab world to truly practice the brotherhood and unity of Islam: “Since the Arab image is almost inseparable from the image of Islam, the Arab world has a multiple responsibility that it must live up to. Since Islam is a religion of brotherhood and unity those who take the lead in expounding this religion are duty-bound to set the highest example of brotherhood and unity. It is imperative that Cairo and Mecca (the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs and the Muslim World League) have a religious ‘summit’ conference and show a greater degree of concern and responsibility for the present plight of the Muslim world, or other forces will rise up in this present generation of young, forward-thinking Muslims and the ‘power centers’ will be taken from the hands of those that they are now in and placed elsewhere.”\n\nMalcolm may not have spoken directly to the issues that confront the Arab world in the way that West would have liked, but I think West believes that Malcolm was less critical of the Arab world than he actually was. This is especially apparent when West writes about “Malcolm’s silence on the vicious role of priestly versions of Islam in the modern world.” One thing to also keep in mind is that Malcolm lived during the 1950s and 1960s, and during that period the Arab world was itself becoming free of European colonial domination. Malcolm saw Arabs as being part of the global non-white majority that was resisting white domination. This also contributed to shaping how Malcolm viewed the Arab world, especially in relation to struggles being fought by Africans in the United States. Again, West was writing from a different historical context that cannot be so easily applied to the period of time in which Malcolm lived.\n\nIn the years following the release of Race Matters, the positions which West has taken have consistently demonstrated that West is an integrationist who opposes all forms of nationalism, including forms of nationalism aimed at empowering African people. This topic came up in a debate that West had with John Henrik Clarke, in which Clarke pointed out that West made a distinction between peoplehood and nationhood where African people are concerned, but he would not make such a remark to an Israeli.\n\nWest also debated the topic of nationalism with Malik Zulu Shabazz. At the 33 minute mark in the video below, West affirms his love for Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammad. He does this to let the audience know that he loves the nationalists, but the reality is that this is just rhetoric from West. I state this because, as his writings on Garvey in Race Matters demonstrates, West has a very shallow understanding of Garveyism. I would argue that he has a very shallow understanding of nationalism in general. I don’t deny that West genuinely loves and respects nationalists, but at the same time he does not understand nationalists and I am not sure if he has ever made the effort to truly understand the nationalists.\n\nWest’s differences with nationalists were also very apparent in this exchange below between himself and Sister Souljah. Much like in the debate with Clarke, West struggled to muster a response to Sister Souljah’s uncompromising support for her nationalist position which is rooted in self-reliance rather than looking for white allies. Sister Souljah rejects West’s argument that African people should accept whatever support they can get from a few white supporters.\n\nI don’t deny the fact that West has been one of the most respected and influential intellectuals in the United States, but I also recognize that one of the reasons for this is because his integrationist views are relatively safe and relatively moderate compared to more radical voices who promote nationalism and self-reliance. I would argue that the body of West’s work displays both a discomfort with nationalism and a misunderstanding of nationalism."
