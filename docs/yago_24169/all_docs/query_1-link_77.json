To help answer them, weâve reached out to scholars and other experts on race. Send us your questions â thereâs a place to do that at the bottom of this page â and weâll try to answer those, too.\n\nOur purpose here is not to chide, preach or settle historical scores. Weâre all in this together. And we all have questions. Here are some of yours."
