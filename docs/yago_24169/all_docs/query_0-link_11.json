just The New Jawn.\n\n- January 6th was not some sort of violent, crazy outlier.\n\n- I don't care how good you are or how good you think you are, there is always something to learn.\n\n- I mean what other country sends comedians over to embedded military to make them feel better.\n\n- People call me 'cause they feel nobody's paying attention.\n\n-_ It’s not all about memorizing and getting information, it’s what you do with that information.\n\n- (slowly) Start talking right now.\n\n- That's a good question, high five.\n\n(upbeat music) - Hi everyone, Steve Adubato here.\n\nFor the next half hour, we're gonna have a conversation with one of the most thoughtful, interesting, compelling, some might say, controversial, but one of the most interesting people I've ever spoken to in the past, and I'm honored to have him back again.\n\nHe's Dr. Cornel West.\n\nYou know who he is.\n\nYou don't even need me to tell you this.\n\nHe's Dr. Cornel West.\n\nHe's an independent candidate for President of the United States, and also a Professor of Philosophy and Christian Practice at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nDr. West, it's once again an honor to have you with us.\n\n- Brother, it's always a blessing.\n\nYou have such a high quality team, work so well and so patient, but I can understand when they're working with you.\n\nAnd I salute your precious mother Francis, though, man.\n\nWe know how precious mothers are.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\n- Absolutely.\n\nDr. West, do this for us.\n\nPhilosophy, I get.\n\nChristian Practice, describe what that means.\n\n- Christian Practice simply means a love-centered practice where you love your neighbor as yourself, which means you are a neighbor to all others, and you're willing to not only serve but sacrifice.\n\nYou have a steadfast commitment to their welfare.\n\nAnd of course, that's biblical.\n\nAnd I'm very much a biblically-centered Christian in terms of defining what moral and spiritual greatness is.\n\nHe or she is great among you, will be your servant, will love, will sacrifice, will tell the truth, will seek justice in the spirit of humility, but with a spirit of tenacity, you're constant and consistent.\n\nSo that's a great tradition though, brother.\n\nThat's my tradition.\n\n- I have, and you may not be able to tell from the cover, but this is one of your most significant books, \"Race Matters.\"\n\nYou might not be able to tell.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- And it's all marked up on the inside.\n\n(Cornel laughing) - It's kind of.\n\n- I've been going back and marking it up for years now, and race does matter.\n\nSo let me do this.\n\nLast time we spoke was several years ago in Atlantic City at the New Jersey Education Association Convention.\n\nYou were the keynote speaker, and I was honored to sit for half an hour with you in person.\n\nAnd we talked a little bit about race then, but I wanna update that conversation.\n\nWhere are we today?\n\nBecause race matters.\n\nWhere do you believe we are today in 2024 as it relates to race relations in our country?\n\nA, where are we?\n\nB, what do we need to do to get to a much better place?\n\n- I think it's very important to always keep attuned to what the moral and spiritual standards are, my brother.\n\nAnytime you talk about race, the standards are all of us acknowledging that we are made in the image of a God that gives us the sanctity and the dignity.\n\nThe secular aversion of that in terms of egalitarianism is a religious version, but that's the standard.\n\nSo the question becomes, how then are we treating Black people, Indigenous people, Asian people, any human beings, but especially those who have been degraded and demeaned?\n\nAs human beings, affirming their sense of humanity and allowing them to live lives of decency and dignity.\n\nThat's the standard.\n\nSo then when we look at where we are now, oh, my God, we've got a lot of institutionalized contempt out there.\n\n- As opposed to regular contempt?\n\nWhat's the difference between institutionalized contempt and just plain old contempt?\n\n- Well, that's a wonderful question because both of them ought to be rejected, but institutionalized contempt means when it works through your laws or when it works through your custom.\n\nSo it becomes normalized.\n\nOr you can take for example the history of Italians coming into the United States.\n\nThey're Catholic from the southern part of Europe, so they don't have the same status as the Brit from the northern part of Europe and is Protestant.\n\nSo that the customs and the morays were deeply anti-Catholic and anti-Italian, even though the laws themselves were not targeting just Italians, you see.\n\n- Right.\n\n- So that institutionalized contempt is through the laws and more formal institutions.\n\nNow, it's now with Black people, of course, you had both.\n\nYou got the laws of slavery, the laws of Jim Crow, and then you've got the customs of these people are less beautiful, less moral, less intelligent, and so on.\n\nBut the important thing is you know and I know that a precious Italian brother and sister has exactly the same value as a precious Black brothers and sister.\n\nWe're talking about something profoundly human and we've got to always come back to that or we'll find ourselves sliding into forms of hatred, forms of revenge, forms of contempt.\n\nWe've got to have a moral corpus, a compass, and especially at a moment in which there's so much hatred and revenge and contempt being expressed.\n\n- A along those lines, Doctor, first of all, I wanna go back to the issue of race relations in just a moment, but I wanna go to the presidency first.\n\nLemme try this.\n\nYou're running for president as an independent because?\n\n- Because I believe both parties are beyond redemption in terms of speaking the truth and seeking justice, especially for poor and working people.\n\n- Including the Democratic party?\n\n- Oh, absolutely.\n\nThe Democratic party is deeply captured by big money, big business, Wall Street.\n\nYou can see when they have a choice to bail out Wall Street versus Main Street, they go Wall Street.\n\nThat's Biden and Obama many, many years ago.\n\nI think that the sad reality is, is that big money dictates so much of American politics these days, and big money usually is associated with raw power, not associated with morality.\n\nNow, I believe that rich people can make moral judgements and follow through, but the dominant tendencies of the wealthy is be obsessed with their interests rather than morality.\n\nAnd morality for me has to do with how are you treating the least of these?\n\nHow do you treat the most vulnerable?\n\nHow are you treating the children, the elderly, the disabled, those folk who have been pushed against the wall, poor people?\n\nWhere's the discourse on poverty right now in the country?\n\nNeither party talks about it.\n\nI come outta the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and Dorothy Day and Rabbi Heschel.\n\nYou begin talking about the least of these, you begin talking about the poor, you begin talking about the children and the elderly and those who are pushed back.\n\n- Dr. West, let me push back a little bit on this.\n\nSo if someone were to play the game, who's worse?\n\nWhat I mean by that is who's worse when it comes to the plight of people who are struggling economically, disproportionately Black or Brown, who's worse for that community of Americans?\n\nIs it Donald Trump or Joe Biden?\n\n- Yeah, but you see, I don't live my life playing the who's worse as a lens- - You're not gonna play the lesser of two evils.\n\nYou won't do it.\n\n- Exactly, I just, I don't live my life like that.\n\nI mean, it's like Frederick Douglass in the 1850s.\n\nHe had to choose between a liberal slaveholder and a conservative slaveholder.\n\nHe's an abolitionist.\n\nHe's not going, who's worse, who's not worse?\n\nThey opted for a liberty party, right?\n\nThat came into free soil.\n\nNext thing you know, here's Abe Lincoln.\n\nAbe Lincoln's got the integrity, he's got a willingness to grow and so forth, and they can break the back of the slavery that Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman and William Lloyd Garrison with the multiracial movement.\n\nSo that, for me, I try to look at the world through the lens of the cross in a Christian sense.\n\nThe cross signifies unarmed truth.\n\nThe condition of truth is to allow suffering to speak.\n\nThat cross signifies unconditional love, and justice is what love looks like in public.\n\nSo that I come out of tradition in which I wanna tell the truth about both parties.\n\nI think you got corruption in both parties.\n\nYou got indifference to poor in both parties.\n\nThere's no doubt I think Donald Trump is a neo-fascist.\n\nThere's no doubt about that.\n\nBiden himself is tied at the moment to some very, very ugly policies, genocide, and ethnic cleansing, and so forth.\n\n- You're talking about Gaza.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\n- You're talking about support of Israel.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\n- So bring it up because let me ask you this.\n\nIf your candidacy were to attract a significant number of voters, a significant number of African American voters, people of color, all kinds of voters, and you supported Bernie Sanders last time, you're running yourself this time.\n\nIf that were to help Donald Trump become president once again, which is clearly not your intent.\n\n- That's right.\n\n- Does that, would it concern you?\n\n- Oh, absolutely.\n\nI know that Trump enables the same kind of genocide that Biden does in terms of that particular foreign policy.\n\n- Not worse?\n\n- But you see, my truth telling and my justice seeking takes the form of trying to convince all fellow citizens, whoever they might be thinking about voting for.\n\nYou and I know 40% of fellow citizens don't vote at all, and I'm spending a lot of time speaking to them just to get them to participate in the voting process.\n\nThen you've got another 63% who say they will never, ever, ever vote for the two parties.\n\nAnd right now you've got, what, 68% who are disappointed in the two, but haven't decided.\n\nSo that each candidate, they have to make the case.\n\nNo candidate owns anybody's votes.\n\nThey have to earn those votes, you see.\n\nSo that if for example, let's say in the Gaza situation, we got American citizens that say they're gonna vote for Brother West rather than Brother Biden because of Gaza.\n\nI'm not stealing from Biden.\n\nThat's his fault.\n\nThat's his policy.\n\nThey have a right to respond.\n\nIf those bombs are being dropped on their grandparents and their family members and so forth, Biden doesn't own their vote.\n\nHe's not making a case for their vote.\n\nThey're looking for somebody else.\n\nAnd if they choose Brother West because I have a moral commitment rather than just a tactical and strategic one.\n\nI respond because of the voters moving away as opposed to those are precious human beings whose lives are not to be taken.\n\n13,000 precious children, a Palestinian child has the same value as an Italian child, a Black child, an Israeli child, an Ethiopian child, or Guatemalan child.\n\nThat's my sensibility.\n\nIt's the moral issue.\n\n- And the same thing about October 7th.\n\nSorry for interrupting, Doctor.\n\nBut the same in terms of October 7th, the horrific massacre perpetrated by Hamas on Israelis, children, women, men, innocent people.\n\n- Murder is murder, brother.\n\n- Murder is murder.\n\n- Murder is wrong.\n\nMurder is murder and murder is wrong.\n\nThere's just no doubt about that.\n\nNow, it's also true that as you know, I mean, Hamas itself was founded in 1988, so you already had a context of Palestinians being terrorized and you get a counter-terrorist organization that responds.\n\nBut I believe murder is murder.\n\nI believe in being morally consistent.\n\nI believe in being ethically constant in terms of anytime you kill an innocent child, it's wrong my brother.\n\nI don't care what color the child.\n\n- There's no justification for their actions.\n\n- I don't care who does it, that's right.\n\nIf the IDF does it, if the American troops do it, if British troops do it, if South African troops do it, if Hamas does it, it's morally wrong.\n\nBut at the same time, it's true that when you're a counter-terrorist organization, you have to keep in mind what the context is without trying to justify or excuse murder.\n\n- We're talking with Dr. Cornel West.\n\nThought provoking, compelling, and we'll continue the conversation in just a moment.\n\n- [Narrator] To watch more One on One with Steve Adubato find us online and follow us on Social media.\n\n- Welcome back, folks.\n\nWe're talking with Dr. Cornel West.\n\nHe needs no introduction.\n\nDr. West, lemme go back to the conversation about race relations.\n\nSo the United States Supreme Court decides what they decide regarding affirmative action, particularly as it relates to, college, entry into admissions that race will no longer be used as a criteria for admission.\n\nTo what degree do you acknowledge that there is a significant degree of resentment, quote unquote, white resentment from many, many of whom support Donald Trump or may not but who are saying, \"We've done enough, enough is enough.\n\nWhat about my kid?\n\nAnd when are we ever going to quote, balance the scales and say, \"We're good with affirmative action quotas, et cetera\"\" There's a question in there somewhere.\n\nDo you understand the so-called white resentment?\n\n- Oh, oh, absolutely.\n\nI just think that we have to be honest with our fellow citizens.\n\nWe have to respect them enough to tell them the truth.\n\nYou and I know, affirmative action emerged in the '60s because there was - Richard Nixon.\n\n- A (crosstalk) under Nixon - Under Nixon.\n\nThat's right, Republican, absolutely.\n\nBut they called it preferential treatment because black folk had been excluded for hundreds of years and there was a affirmative action for white Protestants, especially, 'cause the white Catholics are very different.\n\nCatholics had their own forms of discrimination against them, my brother.\n\n- I hear you.\n\n- When I was at Harvard College, I was right there on the faculty floor.\n\nAnd I'd say, \"Where are the Italian professors?\n\nWhere are the Italian students?\"\n\nAnd everybody get quiet and say, \"Oh, how come you're concerned about Italians?\"\n\nWell, I'm concerned about justice.\n\nI've spoken all the time about black folk but I'm concerned about any group that has not been fairly treated.\n\nNow black folk are Exhibition B, Exhibition A is indigenous peoples in the country, right?\n\nBut it's interesting to me that what happened was, affirmative action began by saying, \"We want this special treatment for these folk who have been excluded all these years.\"\n\nBut when they shifted to diversity, it was no longer a question of injustice.\n\nIt was just a question of making things more diverse.\n\nSo when the morality drops out and it becomes just a tactic for bringing in a lot of different people.\n\nAnd that's a good thing but that's a different thing.\n\nAnd that's what was struck down.\n\nThat's what was struck down.\n\nI've always felt poor students, especially at the elite institutions, they need a special treatment to get in too, because they've gone through hell and high water to get those As.\n\nThey've gone through hell and high water to be able to achieve.\n\nAnd they ought to be able to have access in the same way that anybody else does.\n\nAnd some of those are poor white students too.\n\nSo you've got class as well as race operating here.\n\n- So Dr. West, let me ask you, I asked you the same thing in Atlantic City when we sat in person at the teacher's convention, I'm gonna do it again.\n\nWhy do you think it's so difficult for so many Americans to have a remotely honest and candid conversation about race, race relations, our racial similarities, our racial differences of opinion, thoughts, whatever, without demonizing each other or not talking to each other and talking to those who look like us and saying what we want to say and feel safe to say, I'll get off my soapbox in a second, but we're not really talking to each other.\n\n- Right, right.\n\n- Why not?\n\n- No, it's true, it's true.\n\nI think part of it is, is that it's a very painful thing to talk about.\n\n- Race?\n\nWhy is it painful?\n\nI'm not simply talking about the painful, horrific history of racism, slavery, Jim Crow, but where we were, where we are, what our differences are.\n\nWhy is that painful as opposed to just honest?\n\n- Well, it's both, you're right.\n\nIt's honest, but it's also painful.\n\nFor example, you and I, we sit down as brothers and we reflect and I say, \"Well, Brother Steve, man, if you had a sense of some of the things that I have to put up with week in and week out, in terms of people saying this and people putting you down this and people saying, you have no real talent and merit.\n\nYou just got in positioned because of your race and so forth.\n\nAnd you say, \"Oh Brother West, that's ridiculous.\n\nMy god, you carrying that kind of burden out.\"\n\nI say, \"Yeah Steven, I don't talk about it that much, but it's a painful thing.\"\n\nAnd it's not a matter of trying to solicit your pity because we know pity itself, victimizes, right?\n\nIt's just an honest dialogue about what people are going through.\n\n- Well, along the same lines, Doctor, I'm sorry for interrupting, Doctor, because it's a question of empathy from my point of view, not pity.\n\n- Exactly.\n\n- Let me ask you this.\n\n- Crucial distinction.\n\n- Let me ask you this.\n\n- Crucial distinction.\n\n- Among many of my friends who happen to be white and disproportionately Italian- American, the guys I hang out with from my old neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, they all live in the suburbs now.\n\nWe talk to each other.\n\nHere's the thing, if they were to talk to you or someone else of color to describe their frustration.\n\nTheir worry about their kids' future, their sense that they're wondering where their opportunity is for their children, grandchildren, et cetera, they actually believe that.\n\nAnd I'm not saying they, because I'm one of them, I may not agree with them on everything, and I don't, but my point is this, how much empathy would there be for that point of view as opposed to, are you kidding me?\n\nYes, you may have been discriminated against in this situation or that but it's not institutional, it's not systemic, and it's nothing compared to what people of color have dealt with.\n\n- Oh, see, I think that empathy ought to go not just both ways, but all ways.\n\nThat's part of what the love ethic is all about, you see.\n\nYou think of the relationship between Vito Marcantonio and the great WB Du Bois.\n\nDu Bois is the greatest.\n\n- Vito Marcantonio (crosstalk) - In New York, one of the great New York City politicians.\n\nBack, back, back in the day.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n- That's right, he represented East Harlem.\n\nHe was also a brilliant lawyer.\n\n- He was a progressive.\n\n- He was W. Du Bois's lawyer when Du Bois was brought to court with his hands cuffed.\n\nAnd they had a human relationship, a humane relationship.\n\nDu Bois could deeply sympathize with what Italian brothers and sisters were going through at that time.\n\nAnd of course, Marcantonio deeply empathized with Du Bois and the black community.\n\nOf course, he was representing black and Spanish speaking as an Italian brother, as an Italian brother, you see.\n\n- But that's so rare.\n\nAnd by the way, take a look at the documentary we did, Jacqui Tricarico and I did a documentary on Sacco and Vanzetti that I know Dr. West knows well.\n\nHe knows why I mentioned it.\n\nI'm not gonna open up that Pandora's box, but he knows why I mentioned it and how it's relevant to the conversation we having right now.\n\n- It's a courageous thing you did.\n\nVery courageous what you did, my brother.\n\nI'm just throwing that in.\n\n- I appreciate that.\n\nBut let me try this.\n\nWhy and where.\n\nI know you're an optimistic person by nature.\n\nI've seen you enough.\n\nI've interviewed you in the past, and again, I get a sense of you, but why are you optimistic about our representative democracy?\n\nIt's not debatable.\n\nWe know we're in danger but what gives you reason to be optimistic, Dr. West?\n\n- Well, one, my brother, I would never call myself an optimist.\n\nI'm a prisoner of hope.\n\nI believe that's a very different thing.\n\nNow, you know the difference between the Christian discourse on hope and secular discourse on optimism.\n\nI believe we are a wretched species, my brother, and organized greed, institutionalized hatred, routinized indifference toward the vulnerable are the dominant tendencies of our species, going back to the caves.\n\nThe beautiful thing is we have possibilities of eruption and interruption with love, justice, sweetness, kindness, gentleness, grins, hugs, family feelings that provide some counterweight against the greed and against the hatred and against the indifference.\n\nAnd so hope simply says, \"We can always go another way.\n\nWe can always make choices for integrity, honesty, decency, and generosity.\n\nBut generally speaking, going back, there’s 70 empires in the history of the species, the United States is the 68th empire.\n\nNow, Jefferson said, \"We're the empire of liberty.\"\n\n- He did.\n\n- Well, that sounds a little oxymoronic from the indigenous people's point of view.\n\nWe know we're in empathy of vicious attack, stolen land, from enslaved Africans and we're in an empire of ugly slavery and Jim Crow and Jane Crow and lynching and so forth.\n\nFrom the Italian's point of view, it's discrimination and anti-Catholic perception and so on.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean we haven't had breakthroughs, but we've only had breakthroughs when you had courageous people who chose empathy, who chose integrity, and tried to enact some kind of justice.\n\n- Pandora's box, I'll open it anyway.\n\nYou have two minutes left, Doctor.\n\nImmigration policy in our nation, the crisis that many people believe it is a crisis, and it is for many in certain communities with limited resources.\n\nEvery community has limited resources.\n\nWhat do you believe needs to be done regarding the situation as it relates to our borders?\n\n- Well, one the Canadian border is an open border, right?\n\nWe've got open borders.\n\nWe, Americans can go to almost any country with open borders.\n\nSo we gotta keep in mind when we're talking about borders, we're zeroing in on Mexico, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico.\n\n- That's right.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\nThe first move is to treat people humanely.\n\nThe second is to make sure we have procedures that people can gain access to the country.\n\n- Is a wall wrong, Dr. West.\n\n- Yeah, I think a wall is wrong.\n\n- It's wrong.\n\n- I think it's wrong.\n\nI really do.\n\n- Morally wrong?\n\n- Yeah, I think it's morally wrong.\n\nI really do.\n\nI think there's ways in which we could come up with criteria such that there's a difference between legal and illegal.\n\nI still believe in that, but I do believe that for the most part, for those people who are fleeing, and of course, you know the levels of violence and poverty, that they are leaving.\n\nAnd sometimes it's actually connected to US policy, sometimes it's not.\n\nSometimes it's just corrupt leadership.\n\nSometimes it's just bankrupt leadership.\n\nSometimes the gang activity is becoming so overwhelming because of the levels of poverty.\n\nSo there's a lot of different factors.\n\nBut we could have a summit of leaders of those particular countries that are trying to gain access to the United States and say, these are the ways in which we're going to try to treat these people humanely.\n\nAnd we'll come up with ways in which there's access and we'll come up with ways in which some people will not be able to get in.\n\nEverybody just can't get in, there's no doubt about that.\n\nBut we also have to make sure citizens here don't feel as if they had to pit themselves over against the newcomers, because that's scapegoating the most vulnerable, rather than confronting the most powerful.\n\nIf that were the case, we never would've had Jews and Italians and Poles and others, coming into the country over the last 150 years.\n\n- Hey, Dr. West, I said it to you five years ago when I interviewed you.\n\nI'll say it again.\n\nIt is an honor to have a conversation with you and just listen to your thoughts.\n\nPeople can decide whether they agree or disagree, but it provokes thought, an honest, genuine, civil, respectful conversation.\n\nI cannot thank you enough, thank you, Dr. West.\n\n- I thank you, my brother.\n\nYou know, it's always a blessing to be in conversation.\n\nAnytime your team calls, I respond, even though sometimes it takes a while.\n\n- Thank you, Dr. West.\n\n- I salute you.\n\nI salute them, my brother.\n\n- Thank you so much, I'm Steve Adubato, that's Cornel West, Dr. Cornel West.\n\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n- [Narrator] One-On-One with Steve Adubato is a production of the Caucus Educational Corporation.\n\nCelebrating 30 years in public
