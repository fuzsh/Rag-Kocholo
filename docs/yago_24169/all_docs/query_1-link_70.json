Studies on the psychology of racial dialogues indicate social and academic norms that dictate against race talk between White Americans and persons of color: (a) the politeness protocol, (b) the academic protocol, and (c) the color-blind protocol. These protocols discourage race talk and allow society to enter into a conspiracy of silence regarding the detrimental impact oppression plays on persons of color. Facilitating difficult dialogues on race requires educators to recognize what makes such discussions difficult. For people of color, engaging in race talk exposes them to microaggressions that invalidate and assail their racial/ethnic identities. For Whites, honest discussions are impeded by fears of appearing racist, of realizing their racism, of acknowledging White privilege, and of taking responsibility to combat racism.\" - Derald Wing Sue\n\nFacilitating Difficult Race Discussions: Five Ineffective Strategies and Five Successful Strategies (Derald Wing Sue)\n\nStudies indicate that instructors who have not developed a good sense of who they are as racial and cultural beings tend to use ineffective race talk strategies. These behaviors generally lead to negative outcomes in race talk but are of value in demonstrating what not to do and revealing possible solutions\n\n1. Understand your racial/cultural identity\n\n2. Acknowledge and be open to admitting your racial biases\n\n3. Validate and facilitate discussion of feelings\n\n4. Control the process, not the content, of race talk\n\n5. Validate, encourage, and express admiration and appreciation to participants who speak when it feels unsafe to do so"
