        "text": "Race Matters is a 1993 book of essays written by philosopher and activist Cornel West. In these essays, West takes a deep look at the history and current issues affecting black Americans, as well as how political ideologies both help and fail to combat the problems of racism, poverty, and nihilism (which he defines not as a philosophy but as “the lived experience of coping with a life of horrifying meaninglessness, hopelessness, and [most important] lovelessness”).\n\nThe book is divided into 8 essays, spanning topics such as black leadership, affirmative action, and the pitfalls of racial reasoning. West also critiques several political leaders and ideologies; one common critique of West himself is that he is good at pointing out problems, but not as good at identifying solutions. However, one of West’s major hopes for the book, as he states in the epilogue, is to reopen and revitalize the conversation about race."
