The playoffs are only two more games away for the Golden State Warriors, and with the eighth seed still undecided, the team is still in the dark about who they will face next weekend.

Point guard Shaun Livingston, who notched the start tonight in place of an injured Stephen Curry, was asked who he'd rather face in the first round.

“Probably Portland, just because nobody wants to play in the mountains,” Livingston told reporters after morning shootaround. “I hate playing there, man.”

“There's a reason why they got a good home record every year. The altitude, man, that is real.”

The Blazers (40-40) are a game-and-a-half ahead of the Denver Nuggets in the race for the eighth and last spot of the Western Conference playoffs — a race that will likely come down to the wire.

The Nuggets (38-41) have a 22-18 record at home, but have won only five of their last 10 games, thing Portland has taken full advantage of by taking the last playoff spot within the last two weeks.

“It’s hard to breathe up there,” Livingston said. “Good city. But to play? Nah.”

While neither team is likely to give the Warriors any trouble during the series, an extra game or two in altitude can likely play a factor in fatigue and overall level of conditioning going into the second round.
