        "text": "PEORIA â€” The Golden State Warriors enlisted some veteran help for their trophy presentation Thursday night after they clinched the Western Conference championship and earned a trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nShaun Livingston, the Peoria native and retired member of the Warriors dynasty, joined TNT's Ernie Johnson at center court for the post-game ceremony after Golden State eliminated the Dallas Mavericks to head to the NBA Finals for the sixth time in eight years.\n\n\"It's my honor to present this trophy to the Western Conference champions ... the Golden State Warriors,\" said Livingston, who won three rings with Golden State and handed over the Oscar Robertson Trophy.\n\n'A legacy': How Shaun Livingston sees induction into Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame\n\nThe NBA dedicated an MVP trophy for the conference finals series for the first time, and Livingston presented that as well. The inaugural Magic Johnson Western Conference MVP Trophy went to Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nLivingston, 36, was part of Golden State's NBA championship teams in 2015, 2017 and 2018 during a 15-year NBA career.\n\nShaun Livingston and more: 6 reasons the sports world might know Peoria\n\nHe grew up playing basketball at Concordia Lutheran Grade School in Peoria, finished his high school career at Peoria High School and went right to the NBA as the L.A. Clippers first-round pick (fourth overall) in the 2004 NBA Draft.\n\nHe now serves as director of player affairs and engagement for the Warriors.\n\nDave Eminian is the Journal Star sports columnist, and covers Bradley men's basketball, the Rivermen and Chiefs. He writes the Cleve In The Eve sports column for pjstar.com. Reach him at 686-3206 or deminian@pjstar.com. Follow him on Twitter @icetimecleve."
