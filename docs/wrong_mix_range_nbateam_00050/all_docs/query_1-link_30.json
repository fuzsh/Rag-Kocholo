        "text": "Shaun Livingston had many fantastic performances during his five seasons with the Warriors from 2014 to 2019.\n\nAs a guest this week on the \"Runnin' Plays\" podcast with Grant Liffmann and Kerith Burke, the 35-year-old was asked if any one moment stands out above the rest.\n\nLivingston -- who now is the Warriors' director, players affairs and engagement -- cited Game 1 of the 2015 Western Conference finals against the Houston Rockets.\n\n\"That one for me was kind of like, 'OK. This is what I've been waiting for,' \" he explained. \"Being at this moment, to have this impact at this level. That's what I dreamed of going through all my rehab.\n\n\"And it wasn't anything incredible or sensational. But having the impact, and we pulled the win out. And it's a win we really need, and it affects the series.\"\n\nWith the Warriors trailing the Rockets by 16 points midway through the second quarter, Livingston took over. He scored 10 of Golden State's next 12 points, and the Dubs ended up leading 58-55 at the half.\n\n\"All the air was out the building,\" he said. \"It was kind of like, 'What's gonna happen? This is our first time.' That was a special moment because I was able to kind of calm things down a little bit (and) get us back to where we needed to be.\"\n\nLivingston finished the game with 18 points (6-for-8 FG), seven rebounds, three assists, one steal and was a team-best plus-16 in the Dubs' 110-106 win.\n\nRELATED: Livingston never pictured 'China Klay' becoming such a thing\n\nLet's end this by providing you with several more awesome plays from Livingston during his time in a Warriors uniform:\n\nThanks for the memories and welcome back to the franchise, Shaun."
