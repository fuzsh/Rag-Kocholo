        "text": "I see some similarities, but have to wonder how much of that comparison is based on age and circumstances. Brogdon was a 5th year senior at Virginia. White also spent 3 years at University of Colorado-Colorado Springs before transfering to the Boulder campus and redshirt in for a season. He never played for a junior college like the article states. Very interesting stats are mentioned though regarding White, Fultz, Dwayne Wade, and Penny Hardaway. Thats a hell of a group to be in even if it doesn’t translate past college.\n\nI personally believe White could possibly be better than Brogdon, but they are both combo guards and solid all around players so naturally they share some traits."
