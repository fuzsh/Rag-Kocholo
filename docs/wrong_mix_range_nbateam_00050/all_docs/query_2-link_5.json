        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nGolden State Warriors veteran point guard Shaun Livingston has found his niche in Oakland, California, and doesn't appear to be leaving for at least one more season.\n\nMarc J. Spears of The Undefeated reported that Livingston was informed in the wake of Kevin Durant's decision to join the franchise that the Warriors will also exercise his $5.8 million team option for next season.\n\nOn June 28, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein and Spears that the Warriors planned to keep Livingston for the 2016-17 season even though they could save $2.7 million if they had released him by July 1.\n\nLivingston will enter the final year of his three-year, $16.6 million deal he signed with the team back in 2014, per Spotrac.\n\nComing off of the bench behind Stephen Curry, Livingston has provided valuable minutes for the Warriors while bringing a much different game than what the All-Star starting point guard provides.\n\nLivingston, who has played for nine different teams during his stint in the league, put up a career-high 53.6 percent from the field, looking unstoppable at times with his pull-up jumper from the top of the key.\n\nAt 6'7\", he provides a taller, more physical presence compared to Curry, and he isn't afraid to get physical near the basket on both ends of the floor.\n\nHe put it all on display during Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, scoring 20 points coming off of the bench on 8-of-10 shooting:\n\nIn a stable situation with a winning team, he expressed his desire to stay with the Warriors in a text message to Stein and Spears: \"I would love to be back with Warriors next year and feel there is something special cultivating with the organization. The time spent there has allowed me the platform to see the ingredients of winning and the importance of culture.\"\n\nIt looks like Livingston will get his wish even with Durant on the roster. It also shows just how important Livingston is to Golden State."
