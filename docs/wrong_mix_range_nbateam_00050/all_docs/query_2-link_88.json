        "text": "The Golden State Warriors have signed guard Shaun Livingston to the contract agreed to last week.\n\nThe Warriors announced Livingston's signing Friday. The deal is worth three years and about $16 million using Golden State's full mid-level exception, which starts around $5.3 million next season.\n\nThe Warriors are hoping Livingston can provide some stability as a backup point guard behind Stephen Curry. The 28-year-old Livingston averaged 8.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists with the Brooklyn Nets last season.\n\nGolden State was unable to complete a sign-and-trade for Livingston — or any other free agent — before their $9.8 million traded-player exception expired Thursday night. That would have freed up more space under the NBA's complicated salary cap system."
