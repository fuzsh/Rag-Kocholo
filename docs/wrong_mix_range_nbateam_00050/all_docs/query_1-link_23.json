        "text": "OAKLAND (CBS SF) – Golden State Warriors veteran guard Shaun Livingston doesn't mind being called a \"throwback\" player. In fact, the mere mention of the term brings a smile to his face.\n\nIn an era of the 3-point bomb, fueled by his teammates Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, Livingston's bread-and-butter is the mid-range jump shot.\n\nHe backs the smaller guards defending him into a 12-15 foot range and then rises up using his 6-7 frame to fire in a finger-tip jumper.\n\nIn Game One of the NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavs concentrating on defending the 3-point line, Livingston dominated the game from 15 feet away.\n\nHis 20 points on Saturday night was a career post-season high and led the Warriors to an overwhelming bench advantage and a Game One win.\n\nThe mid-jumper was once considered a must for any championship team. Now, it's inside paint and outside the 3 that is a winning formula.\n\n\"That's the analytics,\" said Livingston on the lost art of the mid-range. \"That's the way it has changed. Rightfully so. Teams have won championships (using an inside and outside game). That's how those teams have been constructed.\"\n\n\"I just have to be true to my game. Play to my strengths…I stick to my comfort zone.\n\nStaying true to himself, Livingston has been a key to the Warriors success the last two season.\n\n\"It's a lost art,\" he said of the mid-range. \"It's not considered the best shot. The high percentage shots are the corner 3 and inside the paint.\"\n\nWhile Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes and Andre Iguodala stretch out defenses from the 3-point line, Livingston has taken advantage of the\n\nweak point in the defense.\n\n\"Teams give you that shot (the 15-foot jumper),\" he said. \"It's the kind of shot in the game plan that that's considered a good shot (to give up) by the other team.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Steph and Klay, the way they space the floor…Draymond and Andre stretch the floor… There's all that space inside,\" he said."
