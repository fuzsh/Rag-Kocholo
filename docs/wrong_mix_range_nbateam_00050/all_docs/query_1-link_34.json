        "text": "Steve Dykes/Getty Images\n\nThe Golden State Warriors on Monday announced that Stephen Curry would be active for Game 4 against the Portland Trail Blazers, but the superstar's health and the team's backcourt depth were tested when point guard Shaun Livingston was ejected in the first half after receiving two technical fouls, per NBA TV.\n\nMarcus Thompson of the Bay Area News Group noted Livingston was arguing because he believed he was hit on the head during a layup attempt.\n\n\"Looks like Livingston did get hit in the head right there. Don't know what Livingston said but surprised that second T came so quick,\" Thompson added.\n\nLivingston, who started the game, scored four points and grabbed three rebounds before being ejected. ESPN Stats & Info highlighted his importance to the Warriors' chances at the time of the ejection:\n\nAndy Glockner of The Cauldron did not agree with how official Scott Foster handled the situation:\n\nJason Quick of CSNNW.com pointed out Foster was \"under the Warriors' skin since the opening seconds of this game,\" though Kurt Helin of Pro Basketball Talk said Livingston should have been \"smarter than that.\"\n\nThe Trail Blazers led 21-5 seven minutes into the contest and 67-57 at halftime, and they appeared to be on their way to tying the second-round playoff series at two games apiece, especially with Livingston no longer an option on the other side.\n\nBut Curry got hot after missing his first nine three-point attempts and finished with 40 points, showing no sign of injury as he led the Warriors to a 132-125 overtime victory and 3-1 series lead. Game 5 is set for Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.\n\nCurry was playing for the first time since spraining his right MCL in the first round of the postseason. How his knee responds after 37 minutes of action Monday could dictate the Warriors' chances to clinch the series in the next contest.\n\nGolden State played the first three games against Portland a man down in the backcourt, but it has plenty of players who can handle the ball, including Klay Thompson, Leandro Barbosa and Ian Clark. Plus, Livingston will be back for Game 5 and can spell Curry.\n\nAlso, forward Draymond Green often initiates the offense from the top of the key with his impressive passing skills, as he did whenever Livingston was on the bench during the first three games of the series.\n\nThe Warriors' potential likely hinges on Curry's health and performance, so they'll be eager to see how the reigning MVP feels after his first game in more than two weeks. He certainly seemed healthy—and played well—Monday in Livingston's absence."
