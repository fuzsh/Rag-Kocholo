        "text": "Peoria native and retired NBA player Shaun Livingston has listed a home in Playa del Rey for sale at $1.957 million.\n\nBuilt in 1952, the two-story house has been updated to a contemporary style with white walls and modern fixtures.\n\nThe roughly 3,400-square-foot home features a vaulted-ceiling living room with a fireplace, a dining area, and a loft/family room. The newer kitchen is equipped with an island and stone countertops. Three bedrooms and four bathrooms include a master suite with a dry sauna and a private deck.\n\nA staircase descends from the second-story balcony to a pool deck and a brick-rimmed swimming pool. Patio space and a lemon tree fill out the backyard.\n\nLivingston bought the property in 2004 for $1.217 million and has since transferred it into a limited liability company, records show. In recent years, he has offered the house for lease at a price ranging from $6,500 to $8,450 a month.\n\nAn Illinois Mr. Basketball award winner, Livingston was drafted out of high school by the Clippers in 2004 and battled his way back from a devastating 2007 injury to play 14 seasons in the NBA. He played a key role in Golden State's recent success, winning three NBA titles in five seasons with the team.\n\nAlisha Hall and Dominic Trott of Keller Williams Realty hold the listing."
