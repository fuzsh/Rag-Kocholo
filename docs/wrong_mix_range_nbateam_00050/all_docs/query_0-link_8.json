        "text": "DENVER — Warriors reserve guard/forward Shaun Livingston will miss Sunday’s game against the Denver Nuggets (2-0) because of a left knee contusion. The timing coincides with the Warriors (2-0) also playing on Monday against the Phoenix Suns at Oracle Arena, but Warriors coach Steve Kerr maintained Livingston’s absence “has nothing to do with a back-to-back.”\n\n“He’s pretty sore,” Kerr said before Sunday’s game. “I don’t have any plans for back-to-backs. At this point, we’re going to take it as it comes.”\n\nWarriors forward Andre Iguodala will play on Sunday after missing Friday’s game against Utah because of tightness in his left calf. The Warriors also put Damion Lee on the active roster for the second consecutive game, though he did not play on Friday in Utah.\n\nIguodala will likely assume most of Livingston’s minutes along with Alfonzo McKinnie. Kerr added he might play rookie Jacob Evans, who has had healthy scratches in the Warriors’ first two regular season games.\n\nLivingston, 34, missed a handful of games last season because of a sore right knee (five), personal reasons (three), rest (two) and an NBA-imposed suspension after having a vocal confrontation with official Courtney Lee (one).\n\nAlthough Kerr has not formalized how he will handle his veterans on back-to-back situations, the Warriors coach already has outlined a plan for Livingston.\n\n“I imagine this is how it’s going to go this year. We’re going to try to give Shaun rest wherever we can,” Kerr said. “If he’s banged up, we’re not going to play him. We need him ready for the long haul. On nights like this where he’s banged up, we’ll rest him.”\n\nFollow Bay Area News Group Warriors beat writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWant real-time Warriors news texted to your phone?
