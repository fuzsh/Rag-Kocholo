        "text": "DENVER — The Warriors shot at a frenetic pace, either setting or nearing franchise and NBA records seemingly anytime the ball left their fingertips.\n\nOnce the flood of shots stopped dropping through the hoop, the Warriors cemented a 142-111 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday with two messages that became louder with almost every 3-pointer they took.\n\nOne, the Warriors (30-14) retook supremacy of the Western Conference over the Denver Nuggets (29-14) perhaps for good, rectified a two-point loss here in the third game of the season and established a five-game winning streak with their second-largest point differential of the season (31). The Warriors have four fully healthy and engaged All-Stars in Stephen Curry (31 points), Klay Thompson (31), Kevin Durant (27) and Draymond Green (four points, season-high 13 assists). They are about to add a fifth one when DeMarcus Cousins plans to play on Friday against the Clippers in Los Angeles after spending nearly the past year rehabbing his left Achilles tendon.\n\nThe Warriors downplayed this message. Durant proclaimed, “I think they know who we are.” Yet, the Warriors’ actions provided at least another reminder that their championship armor does not appear to have any significant cracks.\n\n“We’re way past making statements. We know what type of team we are and what we are capable of,” Curry said. “There’s no doubt in our locker room that when we play like we did tonight, we are the best team in the league.”\n\n* * *\n\nSubscribe to the Mercury News and East Bay Times for $40 a year and receive a free Warriors championship coffee table book\n\n* * *\n\nSecondly, the Warriors accomplished something that no one can dispute.\n\nThe Warriors set a franchise record for most points in the first quarter (51) and most 3’s in the first quarter (10-of-14). The Warriors set another NBA record in the shot clock era with their 51 first-quarter points. And then the Warriors fell short of an NBA record for most 3’s in a first quarter (11) as well as a franchise record for most 3’s (24 this season in Chicago).\n\n“It’s beautiful, beautiful basketball,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I just like the way our guys moved the ball, a lot of shot fakes and playing with purpose and playing with a simple style of execution but being aggressive at the same time. Finding that balance is always what we’re looking for. That was as good as it gets.”\n\nInside the Warriors’ explosive first quarter\n\nKerr honestly had no idea what to expect. He suspected the Warriors wanted to build on their four-game winning streak. He has recently become pleased with the team’s improved effort and health, particularly from its All-Stars. They have become invigorated with Cousins’ pending return. Kerr had hoped the Warriors wanted to rectify their two-point loss in Denver on Oct. 21 when they shot 7-of-29 from 3, collected 29 fouls and committed 18 turnovers.\n\nAfter playing flat against other marquee teams in Oklahoma City, Portland, Los Angeles and Toronto, however, the Warriors do not necessarily show their full effort in relatively notable regular-season games. Against Denver, though? The Warriors looked like the best version of themselves against a Nuggets team (29-14) that entered the game ranked second in the NBA in 3-point defense.\n\n“I don’t remember a better first quarter,” Kerr said. “That was a fireworks show.”\n\nThose fireworks produced many highlights. Durant opened the game forcing a turnover and then pulling up from 12 feet within 21 seconds. Thompson threw down one of his four dunks for a 11-2 lead that prompted the Nuggets to call timeout with 9:21 left. Thompson also sank three 3’s in the first three minutes and 39 seconds. Durant then ended the first quarter launching from 30 feet and then throwing down a fast-break dunk.\n\n“A lot of it was open shots,” Curry said. “The way we moved the ball, nobody forced anything. It all came out of the flow. It was all equal opportunity.”\n\nTherefore, nearly everyone appeared to be in a zone. Durant had 17 first-quarter points, while making all of his shots (7-of-7) that included 3 3’s. Thompson added 13 points and went 5-of-6 from the field, 3-of-4 from long. Curry had 12 points all from the perimeter (4-of-6).\n\n* * *\n\nWant Warriors news delivered to your phone?

That was pretty crazy.”\n\nGranted, no one is going to mistake the Warriors for offering a defensive clinic. The Nuggets had 38 points, shot 60 percent from the field and 54.5 percent from 3. Denver guard Jamal Murray had 15 of his 21 points in the first quarter.\n\nYet, the Warriors still remained disciplined in areas that could have led to more defensive issues, which Green considered “the key to the game.” They only had 10 turnovers, including one in the first quarter. They had 38 assists on 57 field goals, including 15 assists in the first quarter on 19 baskets. All of which created the Warriors’ unstoppable offense and prevented the Nuggets from cashing in transition (six points).\n\n“It was a great quarter. But more importantly we sustained it for the entire game,” Green said. “You can have a great quarter and not keep that same focus level and same energy. Then it doesn’t matter. That’s the most important thing, sustaining that energy level and that focus throughout the entire game.”\n\nDid the Warriors play the best game of their season?\n\nGreen pondered that question for a moment.\n\n“I don’t know if it was our best game, but it was a damn good one,” Green said. “We had some pretty good games to start the season. I’d have to look back and look into some of those. This was a damn good one and the best we’ve had in a while.”\n\nHere is what the records show. The Warriors stormed out to a 10-1 start, but their season-opening win against Oklahoma City marked their lone signature win. The Warriors’ highest-point differential came against the Chicago Bulls this week (38 points), which hardly matches for tough NBA competition these days. Meanwhile, the Nuggets entered the game with the Western Conference’s best record and previously showed potential in defending the Warriors from the perimeter, drawing fouls and forcing turnovers.\n\nNot against this Warriors team, though.\n\n“We understand what they’ve been doing all season and the top teams in the West going at it,” Curry said. “It was a good night for us. It’s what we expect to do. It’s not surprising, but obviously we have been talking about putting together game after game in a row at a high level. This has been a good stretch. We have to keep it going.”\n\nDraymond had one of the most effective four-point games.\n\nThe Warriors prolific shooting did not apply to Green, who made four points on 1-of-5 shooting, the lone field goal coming from 3 when no one guarded him. Yet, Green became a key driving force in fueling the team’s offense with a season-high 13 assists.\n\n“He’s just been better in the halfcourt,” Durant said. “Teams are going to play off of him and he knows exactly what he needs to do in order for him to be effective on the offensive side. If they’re going to guard him, he’s setting screens and rolling to the rim. He’s making those cross-court passes. That’s’ what he loves to do. I think he’s figured out how to be himself no matter what the defensive scheme is.”\n\nEver since Green returned from a right toe injury that sidelined him for 13 games, Green has averaged 6.9 assists in the previous 17 contests. Green reiterated that his conditioning has continued to improve recently, but he simply has followed an old adage.\n\n“They’re always going to give me something,” Green said. “Keep it simple and try to take whatever they give us.”\n\nDuring those times, though, Green either pressed to take open shots or became indecisive when teams kept leaving him wide open. Green has yet to consistently address his shooting woes. As the Warriors demonstrated against the Nuggets, that can become mostly a non-factor so long as Green fuels the offense with effective playmaking.\n\n“There’s not a lot of guys that can guard him the way he pushes the floor,” Curry said. “He has shooters all over the floor. It’s another level.”\n\nWarriors are peaking at the right time\n\nAnd to think, if the Warriors looked this dominant against the Western Conference’s previously best team, how are they going to look once Cousins returns? Kerr officially ruled him out for Wednesday’s game against New Orleans at Oracle Arena, but said that he remains on track to play in Friday’s game against the Clippers in Los Angeles.\n\n“Very excited to get it going. Adding Cuz to the lineup and to this team is amazing,” Green said. “One of the best talents we got in this league. Definitely looking forward to it. Hopefully it’s devastating for everybody else.”\n\nIt appears 29 other NBA teams would agree. Hence, their collective reaction when the Warriors signed him last summer to their $5.3 million taxpayer mid-level exception.\n\nBut to think, the Warriors appeared more vulnerable only 12 days ago when they lost to Houston because of James Harden’s 3 at the buzzer in overtime. Then, questions persisted on the Warriors’ effort, their ability to make adjustments, their inconsistent center spot and their varying rotations.\n\nSince then, the Warriors reeled off five consecutive wins, including nail-biters against Sacramento and Dallas, breezy ones against sub. 500 teams in New York and Chicago, a competitive and then a dominant performance against Denver. During that time, Curry no longer plays a staggered role, Curry and Durant have improved their chemistry, Green has improved his conditioning, Thompson has gotten out of his shooting slump and Kevon Looney has not appeared as overwhelmed with the center spot (nine points, season-high 12 rebounds. The Warriors remain so healthy that Kerr might not rest anyone against New Orleans on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nRewind even further, and the Warriors appeared in more turmoil. Curry missed 11 games with his left groin injury. Green missed 13 with his toe ailment. Green and Durant had their infamous argument. The Warriors hada four-game losing streak for the first time since Kerr has coached the team (2014-present).\n\n“I’m very proud of my guys considering where we were a couple of months ago with a lot of injuries and everything else,” Kerr said. “Now here we are. We really settled in and it feels like this is a really good stretch of basketball for us.”\n\nCurry argued that “any time is a good time” for Cousins to join the team. But Kerr sounded aware of the benefits of incorporating him while the team is playing at its best.\n\n“More than anything, we’re excited for DeMarcus,” Kerr said. “It helps we’re playing well and we can plug him in and try to keep things simple. It’ll take some time to get his rhythm. He’s coming off a year with a very serious injury. Coming to a new team. It’ll take some time. We’ll help him along and we’re all very excited about it.”\n\nStill, the Warriors star has become leery of narratives, both good and bad. So just as he seemed calm during the Warriors’ recent struggles, Curry did not gloat over the team’s recent dominance. Instead, Curry looked ahead to the team’s five-game trip against the Clippers (Friday), Lakers (Monday), Washington (Jan. 24), Boston (Jan. 26) and Indiana (Jan 28).\n\n“We have to continue to get better,” Curry said. “We have new challenges ahead of us in adding DeMarcus in the fold and sustaining this effort for 48 minutes night after night.”\n\nWARRIORS HQ PODCAST: Be sure to visit our podcast page at mercurynews.com.
