        "text": "Will it, or won’t it? That was the question on all our minds over four starting flights and the first Day 2 of the Main Event. Could this end up being the biggest one ever? Last year broke the 10,000 player mark, for goodness’ sake - was it realistic to think this one could be even bigger?\n\nTo break the record there would need to be one heck of a turnout on the final Day 2. And, well, that’s just what happened. Whether you put it down to FOMO, bad planning or just a penchant for being fashionably late, over 900 players turned up in the last few levels to set a new high watermark for live poker tournaments.\n\nLast year’s record of 10,043 players is history. This year’s record of 10,112 is the new number to beat. We hate to say we told you so.\n\nWith the field finally consolidating to a single group on Tuesday’s Day 3, literally thousands of players are still in with a chance of walking away with the title of poker’s World Champion. And - obviously - that’s not all they’re playing for.\n\n$10 million awaits the winner\n\nLast year’s winner Daniel Weinman received $12.1M for first place - a figure which many believed was set specifically to establish a new record for first-place prize money, knocking Jamie Gold’s $12M into second place.\n\nAs a result, 2023’s payout structure was criticized for being too top-heavy, with first-place awarded more than three times the prize for third. This year the largest poker prize pool in history - $94,041,600 - will be divided up between 1,517 players with a min-cash being worth $15,000. The top 125 players will receive at least $100,000.\n\nWith one eye on flattening the payouts to address the criticisms of last year, here’s how the final table payouts are set, in nice round numbers:\n\n1st: $10M\n\n2nd: $6M\n\n3rd: $4M\n\n4th: $3M\n\n5th: $2.5M\n\n6th: $2M\n\n7th: $1.5M\n\n8th: $1.25M\n\n9th: $1M\n\nThe final table bubble will pay $800K. Can you imagine winning that much in a poker tournament and feeling disappointed? Sure, $800K can get you an apartment in Manhattan, but still: a bubble’s a bubble.\n\nWith so many players still in there fighting it can be tough to get reliable chip counts, but as Day 3 looms we understand that Anthony Marsico remains at the front of the field after chipping up all the way through Day 2ABC. Add a pinch of salt to taste, but here are the current top six across the entire field, as far as we can see:\n\nAnthony Marsico: 797,000\n\nChristopher Vincent: 772,000\n\nAlex Livingston: 750,500\n\nManuel Machado: 680,500\n\nTyler Hatchel: 679,000\n\nSeven players, eight games, three days\n\nThe $1,500 Eight-Game Mix event spent its second day whittling 103 players down to just seven, who will return for Day 3 to play for the bracelet and the $131,061 up top.\n\nScott Seiver, a three-time bracelet winner this summer and frontrunner for WSOP Player of the Year , started the day in the hunt for bracelet number four but wouldn’t reach the business end of proceedings.\n\nThose who did, however, are mostly a rogue’s gallery of the usual suspects, with 14 WSOP bracelets held between the final seven players. These include chip-leader John Racener (2 bracelets), Josh Arieh (6), Maxx Coleman (1), Marco Johnson (2) and John Cernuto (3).\n\nAlso in the hunt are China’s Xiaochuan Zhang and Garth Yettick of Colorado. Yettick has just the one tournament result on his resume, from 19 years ago, and a fifth place finish will land him a career-high score.\n\nUltra deep stacks, ultra deep crowds\n\nThe Main Event wasn’t the only thing packing them in on Monday, with Day 1b of the $600 Ultra Stack NLH drawing 4,038 players - in addition to the 2,590 who played Day 1a.\n\nWith the Main Event and the Eight-Game Mix running concurrently, there was a lot going on to draw the big names away from this lower buy-in, big field event, but that didn’t mean you didn’t have a chance of busting out a famous face or two.\n\nAllen Kessler was one such face in the crowd, although a tweet from the Chainsaw did seem to illustrate the esteem in which he holds this event.\n\nA tournament for Main Event losers? It all depends on how you look at it - this one awards a bracelet and has a combined prize pool of over $2 million. Kessler won't be winning it, as he bust out before the end of the day. Rhohit Hukmani, on the other hand, just might: the US player bagged the chip lead with 4,125,000 at the end of Day 1b, more than double the next biggest stack.\n\nClose to 800 surviving players will combine for Day 3 to play 17 x 40-minute levels, or down to five players, whichever comes first.\n\nFlip & Go: the 'bizarro-Main'?\n\nIf the Main Event is considered one of the best, deepest structures in all of tournament poker, what does that make the $1K Flip & Go Presented by GGPoker?\n\nFast, that’s what.\n\nThis is the WSOP tournament with the shortest possible route to the money you can imagine. How short? One hand.\n\nFlips were running all day on Monday, and here’s how they work: 8 players put up $1,000 each, are dealt three cards and discard one. Then they’re automatically all-in, cards are flipped and the hand plays out. The winner of each flip advances to Day 2 and into the money.\n\nDay 2 reverts to a traditional poker tournament format, with every player starting with the same stack of 160K chips. 1,088 entries on Day 1 translates into 136 players returning to duke it out the old fashioned way.\n\nAmong those who took their chance and flipped their way into the money are bracelet winner Yuval Bronshtein, Patrick Leonard, Dan Sepiol, Galen Hall, Mike Leah, Shannon Shorr, Jeremy Ausmus, Chance Kornuth and Chris Hunichen.\n\nShaun Deeb is also in the mix, as is his wife Ashley, and another we’d definitely keep an eye out for is Scott Seiver. The 2024 POY contender once famously tried and failed 43 times to win a flip to progress to Day 2, but this time has his bag and will be ready to launch a bid for a fourth bracelet of the summer when the action kicks off at 11am.\n\nPhoto of the day\n\nThe WSOP and the name Binion will always be connected. It seems fitting, therefore, that Jack Binion was on hand to start the action on the day the new record was set.\n\nHand of the day\n\nAA vs. KK vs. QQ is the type of hand that usually ends up with one big winner and two bad beat stories. If you can escape from something like that you can be proud of yourself.\n\nKudos, then, to Robert Eichele and Barry Hutter, playing on the WSOP livestream, who managed to get away from their dominated pocket pairs.\n\nWith blinds at 1K/1.5K/1.5K, Robert Eichele had in the hole and raised to 3.5K from late position, getting a call from Phan in the hijack with and a raise to 12K from Barry Hutter on the button with . Eichele 4-bet to 29K before Phan put in the 5-bet.\n\nThat was enough to convince Eichele and Hutter that their big pairs were not quite big enough, and everyone emerged with their tournament lives.\n\nTweet of the day\n\n$10 million would be sweeeet, but Aaron Barone says what most of us are thinking.\n\nFYI, the answer is $15,000.\n\nVideo of the day\n\nYou know what they say: if you can’t spot the fish at the table… grab a pair of these.\n\nThe day in numbers\n\n10,112\n\nA new bar is set for the Main Event.\n\n1\n\nHand you need to win for a min-cash in the Flip & Go event.\n\n$1,000,000\n\nThe minimum payout if you make the Main Event final table.\n\nComing up on Day #43\n\nOn Tuesday the mega fields combine at last in the Main Event. No more late regs, no re-entries. As Chris Moneymaker says , Day 3 is when you have to start becoming more creative to build your stack, and as a result we expect some good players to make their mark and plenty more to fall by the wayside.\n\nThe $1K Flip & Go will also see players combine for the more traditional day of the tournament, following yesterday’s random flips. They’ll play 30-minute levels from 11am, and won’t stop until they find a winner. Another tourney combining multiple starting flights is the $600 Ultra Stack, where Michael Bell brings in the biggest stack (2,365,000) for a healthy lead at the top of the counts. Day 2 will likely be a long one, and they’ll need another day after that to get things done for good.\n\nThe $1.5K Eight-Game Mix will crown a victor, and with seven players remaining it shouldn’t take as long as the Flip & Go. But many of these are limit games, and many players are stone cold crushers, so we’re not going to guess when this one will end.\n\nTwo more live events get started on Day 43, with the $1K Mystery Bounty PLO tournament - a new one for 2024 - launching with the first of two starting flights, and the $5K NLH starting at 2pm. There’s also a $1K online bracelet event, the NLH Championship, up and running from 3:30pm.\n\nDay #42 gallery\n\nOngoing events\n\nEvent #81: $10,000 MAIN EVENT No-Limit Hold'em World Championship (Day 2d)\n\nPlace Player Chips 1 Alex Livingston 750,500 2 Tyler Hatchel 679,000 3 Donovan Dean 634,500 4 Shuyang Han 604,000 5 Charles Russell 602,000 6 Emilien Pitavy 589,000 7 Adam Friedman 581,000 8 Stephen Song 577,000 Notables 15 Alex Keating 531,000 46 Brian Hastings 438,500 67 Aram Zobian 401,500 238 Landon Tice 292,000 271 Phil Ivey 283,500 275 Dylan Linde 283,000 372 Daniel Smiljkovic 255,000\n\nFull chip counts at WSOP\n\nEvent #83: $1,500 Eight Game Mix (6-Handed)\n\nPlace Player Chips 1 John Racener 3,929,000 2 Josh Arieh 2,732,000 3 Maxx Coleman 1,893,000 4 Marco Johnson 1,228,000 5 Garth Yettick 1,217,000 6 Xiaochuan Zhang 740,000 7 John Cernuto 640,000\n\nEvent #84: $600 Ultra Stack No-Limit Hold'em (Day 1b)\n\nPlace Player Chips 1 Rohit Hukmani 4,125,000 2 Vinay Gautam 1,910,000 3 Micah Trexler 1,800,000 4 Paul Bausch 1,690,000 5 Casey Glick 1,645,000 6 Joseph Larson 1,630,000 7 Leonardo Drago 1,605,000 8 Sungwoo Tae 1,565,000 Notables 119 Greg Raymer 650,000 216 Patrick Moulder 445,000 364 Dan Heimiller 270,000\n\nFull chip counts at WSOP\n\nEvent #85: $1,000 FLIP & GO No-Limit Hold'em Presented by GGPoker\n\nAll players advancing to Day 2 have the same chip stack of 160,000.\n\nBracelet winners"
