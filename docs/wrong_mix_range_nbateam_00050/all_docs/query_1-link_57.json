        "text": "Mike Rohn is in his 14th year as a coach and head recruiting coordinator with the University of Colorado men's basketball program. He was elevated from assistant to associate head coach on Oct. 18, 2017.\n\nRohn, who has been with Tad Boyle from the beginning, is an integral part of the coaching staff that has re-energized the basketball program to national prominence and continues to do so each and every year.\n\nDuring Rohn’s tenure in Boulder, the Buffaloes’ have accumulated 272 victories, the msot by a staff in team history. In addition he has helped guide the Buffaloes to postseason appearances in 11 of 12 seasons (there was no postseason in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic), including seven in a row (2010-17), a program first.\n\n“One of the steadiest people I have ever worked with,” CU head coach Tad Boyle said. “Mike is the ultimate grinder; works extremely hard and he’s a guy that thinks, a forward-thinker. He’s ready to be a head coach. He has all the tools in what it takes to be a head coach, and is invaluable to our staff, and to me.”\n\nRohn has helped Colorado five NCAA Tournament appearances, including a program-best three consecutive trips from 2012-14.\n\nRohn has helped build the CU Events Center into a dominant home court advantage, making the Buffs’ one of the most feared arenas to play in with a 13-year mark of 177-39 (.819).\n\nAs the recruiting coordinator, Rohn helped deliver the 13th ranked recruiting class in the nation, and best in the Pac-12, in 2021 according to 247Sports.com. Rivals had the 2021 class ranked 15th. It was Colorado's second Top 25 nationally ranked class in the last five years as the 2017 class was ranked 25th according to Rivals and Scout. That 2017 class would end up with four 1,000 point scorers.\n\nThe groundwork of the program’s success was built during the first two years where Rohn assisted with back-to-back 24-win campaigns of 2010-11 and 2011-12. The 24 victories continue to be a school record for victories in a single-season. The 24 wins in his first season were part of CU’s run to the NIT semifinals at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the school’s last year in the Big 12 Conference.\n\nThe following year (2011-12), the program equaled another 24 victories, CU’s first year in the Pac-12 Conference. The Buffaloes became just the 10th team in the nation to win at least four games in four days to capture the tournament title at the inaugural conference tournament. The tournament title was the Buffaloes first since winning the Big 8 in 1968-69.\n\nWith the automatic tournament berth, CU earned its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2002-03 and saw the Buffs upset No. 6 UNLV in the first round.\n\nAnother successful season followed in 2012-13 (21 wins), where Rohn and the Buffs earned back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths for the first time in 50 years (1961-62 & 1962-63). The following year (2013-14), another NCAA Tournament followed with 23 wins, setting a school record with three consecutive NCAA Tourney appearances and four-straight 20-winning seasons.\n\nThe 2013-14 campaign saw CU register 23 wins, the third-most victories in school history. That CU team also tallied a third place finish in the final Pac-12 Conference standings, the program’s highest placing in 18 years.\n\nAfter a 16-18 campaign, and a trip to the CBI Quarterfinals in 2014-15, Colorado rebounded with its fifth 20-win season in six years in 2015-16. The Buffaloes sported a record of 22-12 and finished fifth in the Pac-12 at 10-8. Rohn helped Colorado to 11 straight wins during the nonconference schedule, the fifth longest in program history and best run since 1961-62. Colorado’s 21 regular season wins tied a school record – joining the 2013-14 and 1996-97 teams – and 22 overall tied for fourth in the school annals.\n\nColorado made its seventh-straight postseason appearance in 2016-17 with a 19-15 overall record and a berth in the NIT.\n\nIn 2017-18, Colorado had the youngest team of his tenure, with nine players that had not played a minute in a Buffaloes' uniform prior to the season. He helped Colorado to 17 wins, the program's seventh winning season in the last eight years. This young group had some bright moments including back-to-back wins over Top 15 teams for the first time in program history\n\nThat core group returned in 2018-19 finishing with a 23-13 record, advancing to the NIT Quarterfinals. The 23 wins tied for the third most in team history and just one off the school record. Rohn has now been part of the top four season win totals in team history and five of the top six.\n\nIn 2020-21, Rohn helped the Buffaloes to a 21-11 mark, and what would have certainly been a fifth NCAA Tournament appearance during his tenure before the postseason was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Colorado was ranked for a school-record 13 weeks in 2019-20, peaking at No. 16 in mid February.\n\nThe bulk of that team returned in 2020-21, and while navagating the continuing effects of the pandemic, put together one of the best seasons in modern CU history. Colorado was 23-9, finished as the Pac-12 Tournament runner-up and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Buffaloes won a school-record 14 conference games and were ranked in both the final AP and Coaches polls for the first time since 1996-97.\n\nWith a young team in 2021-22, Rohn helped guide the Buffaloes to their fourth-straight 20-win season, finishing at 21-12, a fourth place finish in the Pac-12 and an appearance in the Postseason NIT. The 2021-22 campaign capped off a four-year run with 88 wins, second in program history only to his first four-year stretch with 92 wins from 2010-14.\n\nDuring his 13 years in Boulder, Rohn has mentored nine former CU student-athlete standouts who have made NBA rosters and 27 who have continued their professional careers overseas.\n\nAlec Burks, a sophomore, was CU’s second-ever lottery pick and selected No. 12 overall by the Utah Jazz in the 2011 NBA Draft; Andre Roberson left after his junior year, was the No. 26 overall selection by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2013 (later traded to Oklahoma City).\n\nSpencer Dinwiddie, also a junior, was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the 2014 NBA Draft (second round, No. 38 overall); and Cory Higgins, the school’s all-time co-leader in points, played with the Charlotte Bobcats during the 2011-12 season.\n\nColorado has been represented in four of the last six NBA Drafts with Derrick White in 2017 (San Antonio), George King in 2018 (Phoenix), Tyler Bey in 2020 (Philadelphia, traded to Dallas) and Jabari Walker in 2022 (Portland)\n\nRohn has also coached a number of CU student-athletes to conference excellence.\n\nIn 2010-11, Burks was a Wooden Award Top-20 finalist and unanimous All-Big 12 first team selection; Levi Knutson was the Big 12 Conference Sixth Man of the Year, and Higgins was All-Big 12 third team.\n\nIn CU’s first year of the Pac-12, Roberson (first team, All-Defensive, All-Tournament team), Carlon Brown (second team, tournament’s Most Outstanding Player), and Dinwiddie (freshman team) garnered all-Conference honors.\n\nIn year two of the conference, Roberson (first team, Defensive Player of the Year, All-Defensive team); Dinwiddie (first team) and Josh Scott (All-Freshman team) earned post-season accolades, and in year three, Scott continued CU’s prominence among the elite Pac-12 Conference players selected to the first team.\n\nScott repeated his all-conference honor in 2015-16 and was a finalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, given to the nation’s best big man. Scott was also on the Pac-12 All-Defensive team while front-court mate Wesley Gordon earned honorable mention. George King was named the Pac-12’s Most Improved Player of the Year.\n\nWhite earned 2017 All-Pac-12 First Team honors while also being selected to the league's All-Defense team."
