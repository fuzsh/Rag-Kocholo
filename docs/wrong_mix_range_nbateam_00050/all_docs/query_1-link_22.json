        "text": "Much like Andre Iguodala, veteran point guard Shaun Livingston's time with the Warriors is up.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski cited sources in reporting Tuesday that the Warriors will waive Livingston.\n\nOnly $2 million of the $7.69 million Livingston was owed for the 2019-20 season is fully guaranteed, and The Athletic's Anthony Slater reported through sources that the Warriors will stretch the $2 million owed to Livingston over the next three years.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Bobby Marks, the Warriors needed to use the stretch provision to make sure they stayed below the luxury tax apron. Golden State is hard capped due to the D'Angelo Russell sign-and-trade deal with the Nets.\n\nOriginally, the Warriors had to make a decision on Livingston's contract by June 30, but the two sides reportedly agreed to push the date back to July 10.\n\nAfter playing for eight teams over the first nine years of his career, Livingston found a home with the Warriors in 2014. In five seasons, he was a steady leader off the bench of head coach Steve Kerr.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nIn 367 games with the Warriors, Livingston averaged 5.4 points, 2.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds per contest. He shot 52 percent from the field during that span.\n\n[RELATED: Draymond's defense is so good, they named a stat after him]\n\nIs this the end of the road for the 33-year-old? Maybe not.\n\nDespite whispers that Livingston might retire, Wojnarowski reported that the guard is \"determined to continue playing.\"\n\nBut if Livingston is unable to find a new home, he walks off into the sunset with three NBA championships and a secure spot in the story of the Warriors' dynasty."
