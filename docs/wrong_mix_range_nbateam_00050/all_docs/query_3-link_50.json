        "text": "There is a Warriors playoff model for Jordan Poole — maybe not one he’s eager to embrace, but I believe his more veteran teammates surely can picture it in their minds. Two models, actually.\n\nEvery time he tried to dribble through three defenders and threw up a wild shot that initiated a fastbreak going the other way in the just-concluded Kings series, I thought of Shaun Livingston, the dynastic stalwart who could go weeks without doing anything irrational on the court and especially not in a playoff game.\n\nEvery time Poole made an exasperated face when Steve Kerr took him out of the game, I thought of Leandro Barbosa, one of Stephen Curry’s favorite teammates expressly because Barbosa gave the team so much energy while Curry rested in games and also remained endlessly upbeat even when it was time to come out. Maybe I was also thinking of Barbosa because he’s currently a Kings assistant coach.\n\nIt’s understandable that the 23-year-old Poole wants to do more than Livingston (now a team executive) could give the Warriors in his final five seasons and much more than Barbosa’s pure sixth-man role. Poole already has been paid like it, locking down the four-year, $123 million contract extension last October that won’t start until next season. Poole has rare offensive skills. He has overflowing confidence. He was good last postseason and he wants to be great in this one. You want young players to try to push forward, not roll over and accept the status quo.\n\nBut Poole was one of the Warriors’ worst rotation players in the Kings series — shooting 33.8 percent in the seven games, averaging just 12 points, getting regularly roasted on defense by Malik Monk and others, and getting worse each successive game. And Poole wasn’t too good for most of this season when the Warriors really needed him to raise his game while they adjusted their rotation and dealt with long absences by Curry and Andrew Wiggins.\n\nSo how should Poole approach this gigantic second-round meeting with the Lakers, starting Tuesday at Chase Center? Listen to Kerr’s answer on Monday evening when asked how he viewed Poole’s performance in the Kings series and what he wants from Poole now.\n\n“Wasn’t his best series, obviously,” Kerr said. “I thought (in Game 7) he did his job. He came in and he had the one field-goal attempt early where he tried to drive through traffic, they ended up in transition after that. And from that point on, he ran the team, he took care of the ball, he gave Steph the rest he needed. His minutes weren’t required last night — big minutes.”\n\nThat sounds a lot like the calm, thoughtful, not-so-ambitious performances the Warriors always got from Livingston in the first five years of the dynasty — keep things going in the minutes Curry sits, team up with Curry for a few minutes at a time and just don’t do anything that can fuel the opponent. Because Warriors postseasons are about Curry, setting up Curry, keeping it together when he rests and not screwing things up in the moments between Curry crescendos.\n\nPoole is more ambitious than all that, but the Lakers’ defense will pick him apart if he isn’t careful. And the Lakers’ offense will target him relentlessly. That’s kind of what happened in the Kings series, and the last thing the Warriors need is to go through that again with Poole while they’re dealing with LeBron James and the Lakers.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWarriors-Lakers mega series preview: Can either team score on the other?\n\nThere’s a reason why Curry wanted to speak to the team on Saturday night, as they prepared for Sunday’s do-or-die moment. It’s because he was furious about the listless Game 6 loss and didn’t want the season to end like that. And there’s a reason why, as reported by The Athletic’s Marcus Thompson II and Shams Charania, Curry urged his teammates to remain focused on the goal and not on their own feelings. Which is what happened, and Game 7, and those 50 points from Curry, is what followed.\n\nIt wasn’t just about Poole; it’s logical that a few other players’ body language wasn’t great in Game 6; but Poole is the only non-foundational player who is set to start making $30 million a year. So, yes, there is definitely a big-picture component to all of this. The Warriors got through one of the toughest tests of this era basically without Poole. Which, point-blank, is not a big affirmation for his or their future in any post-Curry future.\n\nCould the Warriors consider trading Poole, for so long considered a centerpiece of their next era? Well, in the best possible ways, Curry keeps delaying any kind of transition. As long as he’s great, the Warriors are duty-bound to keep the championship core together. And if the Warriors decide to offer Draymond a big extension to keep him from hitting free agency, one way to lessen the luxury-tax hit would be to offload Poole’s contract.\n\nI’m not saying the Warriors are thinking of doing this or would want to. They’re in the middle of a playoff run. Poole could have a great series against the Lakers. And the only focus is on the Lakers and Game 1. But part of the logic back in October was that Poole was an asset the Warriors had to retain. An asset who could help them in the playoffs again. And then maybe an asset they can trade in the future if it doesn’t quite work out.\n\nNo, it’s not a surprise that Poole and Draymond are potentially tied together in the Warriors’ financial planning just a few months after Draymond punched Poole during a training camp practice. That was while both were seeking extensions. A little while later, Poole got his new deal. And Draymond did not.\n\nThe most valuable thing Poole can do now is to get himself under control, pass the ball calmly when the defense presses up on him, make the shots that are there for him, scramble as hard as he can on defense, and do the things that Livingston and Barbosa used to do for the Warriors. If Poole does all that, it won’t be hard to plot out the rest of his Warriors career. If he doesn’t, we can imagine how this Warriors season might end … and what else might be coming next.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nYou can't break up Stephen Curry and the Warriors because it'll never be like this again\n\nHere are the Warriors’ cumulative plus-minus numbers for the Sacramento series (only for those who played 20 minutes or more):\n\nCurry plus-58\n\nAndrew Wiggins plus-40\n\nKevon Looney plus-36\n\nDraymond plus-31\n\nKlay Thompson plus-29\n\nPoole minus-11\n\nMoses Moody minus-14\n\nJonathan Kuminga minus-16\n\nDonte DiVincenzo minus-29\n\nGary Payton II minus-36\n\nAnd here’s the cumulative plus-minus for the Warriors in the four regular-season games against the Lakers (who won three of them), only counting the players who will or could have a role in this series:\n\nWiggins plus-28 (two games)\n\nDraymond plus-21 (four games)\n\nAnthony Lamb plus-13 (two games)\n\nCurry plus-8 (two games)\n\nMoody plus-7 (three games)\n\nLooney minus-3 (four games)\n\nPoole minus-13 (four games)\n\nDiVincenzo minus-14 (four games)\n\nJaMychal Green minus-31 (four games)\n\nKuminga minus-32 (four games)\n\nKlay minus-35 (four games)\n\nHere’s the cumulative plus-minus for the Lakers in the regular-season games against the Warriors among those who will or could play a role in this series:\n\nMalik Beasley plus-40 (three games)\n\nJarred Vanderbilt plus-35 (three games)\n\nAustin Reaves plus-18 (four games)\n\nD’Angelo Russell plus-16 (two games)\n\nDennis Schröder plus-13 (three games)\n\nLeBron James plus-12 (two games)\n\nAnthony Davis plus-9 (four games)\n\nRui Hachimura plus-3 (three games)\n\nTroy Brown plus-2 (three games)\n\nWenyen Gabriel minus-28 (four games)\n\nLet’s do this quickly: I’m picking the Warriors to win this series in seven games.\n\nI wobbled on this because I think LeBron and Davis are uniquely difficult matchups for anybody, especially the Warriors, who can get thrown off by smart, active big men. I wobbled looking at how well the revamped Lakers lineup handled the Warriors in the last few regular-season meetings and even more when the Lakers beat the Grizzlies in six games. And that was before the Warriors had to expend so much energy to beat the Kings. I’m already marking Game 1 as a likely Lakers victory, just because the two-day turnaround is going to be a whopper for the Warriors.\n\nBut I’m picking the Warriors because I think Kerr will find a way to lengthen the rotation just a bit out of necessity, maybe with Kuminga bouncing back from his nothing series against the Kings and getting a stint per half defending LeBron. Moody should get a lot of time in this series, too, which could help keep the foundational players fresh enough for another late-series surge. I think the Warriors will win Game 2. I think the two teams will keep alternating wins from there, with the Warriors winning Game 3, the Lakers winning Game 4, the Warriors winning Game 5 back in Chase and the Lakers holding serve at home in Game 6.\n\nThen for Game 7 back in San Francisco, I’ll ride with the feeling that I had before Game 7 in Sacramento: I just can’t picture Curry at a losing podium quite yet. I could and probably should say the same for LeBron, but I’ve seen Curry’s team beat LeBron’s team three out of four times in the finals and I’ve gotten used to it. Curry, Draymond and Klay have, too. The Warriors have never lost a Western Conference playoff series in the Kerr era (they’re now 19-0) and I don’t think that run is going to end this series. Beyond that? We’ll see.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nCan L.A. stop Steph? Can Golden State contain Anthony Davis? Warriors-Lakers series preview\n\n(Photo: Ezra Shaw / Getty Images)"
