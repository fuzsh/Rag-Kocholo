        "text": "[jwplayer iMfgdsDg-z6KDnl0B]\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Shaun Livingston announced in a moving statement via Instagram today that he is retiring from the NBA after 15 seasons. Livingston helped the Warriors to five NBA Finals appearances in consecutive years and three championship trophies in that time.\n\nHe and second-unit mate Andre Iguodala (now with the Memphis Grizzlies) always seemed to dazzle the Dub Nation crowd.\n\nLivingston thanked everyone who contributed to his success, including his father, an uncle, teammates, coaches and trainers.\n\nMost poignant, however, are his reflections on what he overcame during his career. The catastrophic leg injury he suffered could have cost him his leg or left him walking with a limp. When most thought it impossible for him to continue his career as a professional athlete, Livingston became a Warrior and earned three championship rings.\n\nOf his 15-year journey in the league, Livingston wrote:\n\nAfter 15 years in the NBA, I’m excited, sad, fortunate and grateful all in one breath. Hard to put into a caption all of the emotions it takes to try and accomplish your dreams. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Anybody that has beat the odds understands the mental and emotional strain it takes to inspire yourself on an uphill war, let alone inspire others. “The injury” gave me a chance to find and prove to myself (and the world) that I wouldn’t be defined by my circumstances. With my time in the League what I will be most proud of is the fact that my character, values and faith were tested, and I persevered.\n\nFree agency and injuries scrubbed key players from the 2019-20 roster, so the Warriors began a youth movement that did not include the likes of 34-year-old Livingston. But even before those personnel changes took effect, Livingston had begun to speak publicly about injuries becoming more difficult to manage and his consideration of retirement.\n\nREAD SHAUN LIVINGSTON’S COMPLETE ANNOUNCEMENT OF RETIREMENT\n\nHe did not indicate any post-basketball plans in his announcement, but Warriors coach Steve Kerr stated recently that he would like to see Livingston return to the franchise at some point, in some other role.\n\nFor now, Livingston is enjoying his first taste retirement by “rais[ing] a glass.”\n\nWarriors past and present congratulated him on a career well-done, including Zaza Pachulia, Leandro Barbosa, Ian Clark, DeMarcus Cousins and JaVale McGee."
