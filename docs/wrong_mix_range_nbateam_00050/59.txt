OAKLAND -- Klay Thompson and Shaun Livingston are both questionable for Friday's game against the Denver Nuggets, Steve Kerr announced Wednesday afternoon.

Thompson, who injured his knee in last week's loss to the Magic, underwent an MRI Monday that revealed no damage. In Thompson's absence, Golden State suffered a 128-95 loss to the Celtics Tuesday night, the team's worst home loss under coach Kerr.

Thompson, along with Livingston, did not practice Wednesday morning. Livingston also missed Tuesday's loss to Boston due to neck spasms.

Kevon Looney, who's missed Golden State's last two games with right pelvic soreness, practiced Wednesday and is expected to play Friday.
