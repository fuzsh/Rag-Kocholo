Chapel Hill native Kresha Snipes could have met her future husband, Marcus Dean, on multiple occasions during the time that they both spent in Chapel Hill, Charlotte and Atlanta, but they didn’t cross paths for years. Marcus, who is from Wadesboro, attended college at UNC near Kresha’s childhood home. Later, the two both lived in uptown Charlotte and attended a lot of the same local events. Kresha even ran by Marcus’ house on many afternoons. One fortuitous evening after both had moved to Atlanta, they hit the town with mutual friends and finally found each other.

After five years together, Marcus organized a surprise proposal at a Fourth of July party in Miami with all of Kresha’s closest friends watching. The couple married on September 29, 2018 on the driving range at Governors Club with Dr. Rose Snipes Bynum and Joseph Bynum and Sarah and Alfonza Dean Sr. in attendance. The travel-themed wedding featured in-flight beverages, passport photos, tables named after places the couple had visited together and a baggage claim with guest favors. Inspired by the party-provided flip-flops and beautiful weather, the newlyweds and their guests danced the night away. The couple kept up the travel theme by jetting to Aruba for their honeymoon.

They reside in Atlanta, where Kresha is a medical sales representative and Marcus is an attorney.
