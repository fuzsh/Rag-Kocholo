        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nMost of these photos are from The Inklings of Oxford: C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Their Friends (2009) by Harry Lee Poe. Of course, the book includes many more photos. More photos than I’m able to excerpt here.\n\nOnly two photos are taken from elsewhere: the photos of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as young men. These two photos are taken from the LIFE Images Collection/Getty and the Marion E. Wade Center at Wheaton College, respectively.\n\nDates are included if dates were given, but most photos didn’t include a date. Perhaps one could figure out the approximate dates if they took the time to research Lewis and Tolkien. Tolkien lived from 1892-1973, while Lewis lived from 1898-1963.\n\nLewis was known as “Jack” by his friends and family.\n\nJ.R.R. TOLKIEN\n\n(Tolkien as a younger man.)\n\n(Tolkien with pipe, as if a hobbit.)\n\n(Tolkien with Hugo Dyson in 1954. The same year The Fellowship of the Ring was published.)\n\n(Tolkien in the gardens of Merton College, Oxford University.)\n\n(The round Radcliffe Camera and the spire of St. Mary’s across the fellows’ garden of Exeter College where Tolkien, Dyson, and Coghill were undergraduates.)\n\n(The Tolkiens’ home at 20 Northmoor Road in Oxford. They lived there from 1930-1947. Tolkien wrote most of The Lord of the Rings in this home.)\n\n(The Tolkiens’ home from 1953-1968.)\n\n(Merton College, Oxford University, where Tolkien was professor.)\n\n(A wide view of Merton College, Oxford University.)\n\n(Tolkien’s rooms in Merton College, Oxford University.)\n\n(Merton College chapel, Oxford University.)\n\n(The Tolkiens attended the Catholic church of Corpus Christi in Headington.)\n\n(Inside the Catholic church of Corpus Christi in Headington.)\n\nC.S. LEWIS\n\n(C.S. Lewis in 1919.)\n\n(C.S. Lewis with the faculty of Magdalen College, Oxford University.)\n\n(C.S. Lewis writing at his desk.)\n\n(Keble College where Jack Lewis and Paddy Moore received their training as young officers before going to the front in 1917.)\n\n(Magdalen College, Oxford University. C.S Lewis became a fellow of the college in 1925 and tutored English literature from 1925 to 1954.)\n\n(A view of Magdalen College, Oxford University from Addison’s Walk.)\n\n(The cloisters of Magdalen College, Oxford University.)\n\n(The doorway to the staircase that leads to Lewis’ rooms above the ground level arcade of the New Building, Magdalen College, Oxford University.)\n\n(The hall at Magdalen College, Oxford University, where Lewis dined with the rest of the college during term.)\n\n(After his conversion, Jack attending morning prayer in the chapel of Magdalen College every day in term.)\n\n(The Kilns, the Lewises’ home.)\n\n(The tradesmen’s entrance to the Kilns showing the outside stairs Jack Lewis installed so that he could come and go to his bedroom without going through Janie Moore’s bedroom.)\n\n(Jack Lewis chose for his bedroom the little end room in the attic, reminiscent of the favorite room of Jack and Warnie in the house of their childhood.)\n\n(The pond at the Kilns formed in the hole from which clay had been dug to make bricks. Lewis loved to swim and punt in his pond.)\n\n(Among the many landscaping improvements to the Kilns is this semicircular brick bench built into the hillside beside the pond.)\n\n(The Kilns and the surrounding countryside during the time Jack and Warnie lived there.)\n\n(The Kilns when the Lewises lived there.)\n\n(Joy Davidman in front of the Kilns.)\n\n(Jack Lewis spent time and energy clearing a path through the jungle of Shotover Hill that rises immediately in front of the Kilns.)\n\n(Even as development crowds the base of Shotover Hill, the rural atmosphere that dominated when Jack and Warnie bought the Kilns can still be found.)\n\n(The top of Shotover Hill still offers vistas toward the undeveloped land surrounding Oxford that was the rule before industry came to nearby Crowley.)\n\n(Lewis joined Simon Barrington-Ward, the chaplain of Magdalene College, every morning he was in Cambridge for morning prayer in the Magdalene College chapel, where he always sat in the rear corner facing the altar.)\n\n(C.S. Lewis was professor and chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Magdalene College, Cambridge University, from 1954 1963. Magdalene College was smaller and homelier than the great Magdalen College, Oxford University.)\n\n(The forecourt of Magdalene College, Cambridge University.)\n\n(Lewis’ rooms at Magdalene College, Cambridge University.)\n\nFRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\n(The Eagle and the Pub, where the Inklings often met.)\n\n(Lewis with an unidentified friend at an unidentified pub.)\n\n(A portrait of Austin Farrer at Keble College, Oxford University.)\n\n(Owen Barfield c. 1920.)\n\n(Charles Williams)\n\n(Warnie Lewis kept his cabin cruiser, the Bosphorus, docked at Salters boat yard at Folly Bridge.)\n\n(C.S. Lewis and his brother Warnie Lewis c. 1960.)"
