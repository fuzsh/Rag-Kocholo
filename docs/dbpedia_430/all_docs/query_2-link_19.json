        "text": "Joseph Conrad “Bud” Shankles was born to Albert Valentine and Dortha Pauline Deal Shankle on June 25, 1939 in Scott, Arkansas in the tack room of a barn previously converted to living quarters. Growing up in Levy, Arkansas and graduating from North Little Rock Old Main in 1957, he was active playing football in high school as well as having multiple short term jobs such as working one summer in Oregon with this Uncle JB Deal in the timber business, as well as working in a slat mill and delivering groceries.\n\nAfter high school, he would go on to join the National Guard. He later learned his sheet metal trade while working at Wetzlers Sheet Metal and then would go to work with his life long friend Jim Harper at his sheet metal shop. He would later start his own heating and air conditioning company; however, the sheet metal business was never far from his mind. He retired from Alcoa in Benton, Arkansas where he was a welder in the sheet metal shop and could literally make anything out of sheet metal. Throughout the years he would be laid off multiple times at Alcoa and then would be call back to Alcoa and continue to work for Jack Freshour, so for many years he would work both places.\n\nHe tried his hand at bull riding, raced motorcycles, and stock cars. He became a private pilot and would regal us with his “flying through storms” stories that only Conrad would be brave enough to try, especially with only 40 or 50 flying hours. He was also active in the Jaycees for many years and had a heart for the St. Joseph Orphanage where he helped out some.\n\nConrad moved his boys to Bismarck in 1977. During their school years he was very active in coaching many of their little league teams.\n\nIn 1994 he married “Mary” Rachel Byrd and lived in Hot Springs until her retirement in 2013 at which time they moved to the Bismarck farm. He was never so happy as when he was helping neighbors, his boys (both would return to live on the family land), grandchildren and most of all mowing on his tractor. One of his sons would say this was a 17 acre yard as he would manicure it like a golf course.\n\nThe grandkids and great grandkids will remember buggy rides as he loved giving them rides. Many times it would involve the grandkids helping to keep the place clean by picking up garbage by the highway.\n\nConrad would start planning for DKS deer camp 2 months before time to go. He loved deer camp. He will sorely missed there; however, I am sure there are plenty of story regarding him to keep his memory alive.\n\nAnother thing he looked forward to every year was his annual high school reunion. He will certainly be missed there as well.\n\nHe was passionate about westerns, Ford vehicles, President Trump, Civil War history and Lonesome Dove.\n\nHe is survived by his spouse, Rachel; sons, Jay (Kenddra) Shankles, Joe (Tracy) Shankles of Bismarck; stepdaughters Nan (Scott) Means of Hot Springs and Amy (Marcus) Hutto of Damascus, Arkansas; grandchildren, Shawn (Elizabeth) Shankles, Kammi (Scott) Conway, Sommer Shankles, Zachery, Skyler, Jake and Joey Shankles, Chris (Annalee) Branham, Blair and Ben Hutto; and 8 great grandchildren.\n\nConrad was predeceased by his parents, sisters, Jimmie Williams and Gerri Richardson, and stepson, Austin Byrd.\n\nPallbearers will be his grandsons.\n\nServices will be held at Ruggles Wilcox Chapel in Arkadelphia on Thursday, August 8, 2024 with visitation at 1:00 p.m. and the funeral at 2:00 p.m. Graveside will be private.\n\nMemorials may be made in Conrad’s name to John H. Lyons, Sr. Scholarship Foundation at www/ironworkers.org."
