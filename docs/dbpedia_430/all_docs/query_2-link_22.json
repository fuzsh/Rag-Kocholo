        "text": "VICKSBURG, Miss. – Lorelei Books will host a book signing and writers workshop on August 17, with novelist Joy Rancatore, a past winner of the Louisiana Indie Author Project.\n\nJoy E. Rancatore is an award-winning, multi-genre Indie Author focused on writing the soul with heart through Southern fiction with Christian roots, nonfiction writings and fantasy stories, while providing experiences that bring readers and authors together to #ShareTheRead. She is the author of six currently published books, with many more on the way, and an ever-growing number of short stories.\n\nFollowing the author signing of her Carolina’s Legacy Collection, Rancatore will offer a writers workshop upstairs from 12 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. She will discuss the publishing process from pen to published work.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public. A brown bag lunch is encouraged for those who plan to attend the workshop. For more information, contact Lorelei Books."
