In his previous stops with the Vikings he has held numerous positions including Associate Head Coach, Defensive Coordinator, Linebackers Coach and Defensive Line Coach. For the 2022 season White has been tasked with the responsibility of being the Assistant Head Coach / Defensive Line Coach.\n\nA native of Hampton, Virginia, White is a graduate of Kecoughtan High School where he was a two-sport athlete in wrestling and football. After high school, he received a football scholarship to attend Towson State University. Upon the completion of his sophomore year, White transferred to Hampton University where he finished his playing career with the Pirates in 1997. He received both his B.A. and M.A. from Hampton in Political Science (1998) and Counseling (2000) respectively.\n\nWhite's coaching career began as a Graduate Assistant Defensive Line coach at Hampton University for three seasons (1998-2000). While at Hampton, White was part of two MEAC Championships, one SBN Championship, and one Heritage Bowl Championship.\n\nIn 2001 White arrived at ECSU as the Defensive Line Coach. He quickly rose to the position of Defensive Coordinator in 2003. While at ECSU, White was the Defensive Coordinator of one of the top Division II teams in national statistical rankings. In 2006, White's \"Blue Swarm\" defense shutout four opponents and held six opponents to seven points or less. They were ranked 5th in scoring defense, 2nd in turnovers gained, 5th in interceptions, and 4th in fumbles recovered nationally. They returned in 2007 yielding just 234 per game to rank 4th nationally in total defense, and allowed only 15 points per game to rank 6th nationally in scoring defense. During White's six seasons as Defensive Coordinator, he accomplished the distinguished feat of having 23 defensive players earn All-CIAA honors, and four earn All-American honors.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, White was among 30 participants selected to participate in the NCAA Men's Football Coaching Academy. In 2008, he had an article published in the May edition of the American football Monthly magazine.\n\nAfter leading ECSU to two CIAA Championship games in 2006 and 2008 a NCAA Playoff appearance in 2006, White was hired to be an Assistant Coach for the Morgan State University Bears in Baltimore, MD. During his first two seasons, he served as Linebackers Coach and helped develop several outstanding linebackers, including 2009 MEAC Defensive Player of the Year and TSN All-American George Howard. In his next two seasons White served as Morgan State's Defensive Line Coach. In that role, he worked primarily with the Defensive Tackles.\n\nIn 2013 White returned to ECSU. He served as the Associate Head Coach / Co-Defensive Coordinator / Linebackers Coach during the 2013, 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was instrumental in defensive game planning as well as student-athlete development. In 2016, White began a new chapter in his coaching career by being named the Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers Coach at Perquimans High School. He was able to construct a solid defense that helped the Pirates reach the playoffs and earn their best winning record since 2008.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 football seasons presented White with the opportunity to rejoin the ECSU staff again as the Defensive Line Coach. In August 2021 White was tasked with the responsibility of rebuilding the defense. They were able to hold three opponents to under 21 points and win three conference games including a Homecoming win versus a previously ranked opponent.\n\nWhite currently works as a School Counselor in the Elizabeth City Pasquotank Public School System. Coach White and his wife, Felicia, have three children Adrian and Austin and Ariel."
