        "text": "The Visitation and Celebration of Life for Ann will be from the hours of 2:00PM until 5:00PM.\n\nAnne Elizabeth Marcus\n\nFebruary 17, 1930 - May 5, 2024\n\nAnne Elizabeth Marcus of Malverne (for 51 years) relocated to Heaven to be with Jesus on May 5, 2024 in her 94th year, having finished a life well lived. She is predeceased by her husband Alex Marcus in 2011, the love of her life, married for 57 years. Visitation and Celebration of Life Service will be held at Flinch & Bruns, Lynbrook, on Sunday, May 19th, 2 - 5:00 PM.\n\nAnne (Annie) was born in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, NY to Nunzio and Theresa Marino, immigrants from the Naples area of Italy. She was the 7th of eight children; Samuel, Marie, Gene, Frank, Joseph, Alfred and Rose. Her youngest sister Rose is the last surviving sibling of the Marino family. The Brownstone where the children were born and the family lived growing up included her grandparents, parents and siblings. She was raised with a deep love of her family, faith, traditions, and appreciation of good food. She liked to say, “it's all about the food”.\n\nAs a young woman, she attended Barbizon school of modeling, and even did some modeling evidenced by the training which she carried with her throughout her life, adding to her beauty, grace and style.\n\nLater, she graduated from the Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School and became an executive secretary for a defense contractor. Here she had a security clearance, utilized Gregg shorthand, a lost art, and could type accurately over 90 words per minute (no spell check back then)! Anne was a prolific writer, collecting words of wisdom and writing countless notes of encouragement, prayer and scripture to family members and friends throughout her life until the end. She also used her typing skills, serving first her husband, typing his papers for NYU as he attended at night after serving in the Army, and later for her children, with their school papers, all on an old Underwood No. 4 manual typewriter and still at over 90 words per minute!\n\nIn 1953 she had a “chance meeting” on the Coney Island Beach with her future sister-in-law. Having met Alex Marcus as a teen in a friend’s circle, she inquired and learned that he was “available” but in the Army in Europe. She pursued him and they developed a love relationship through letter writing. When his tour was over and his ship came into NY, she met him at the pier with his mother and sister in her shiny convertible. They married four months later in Jan 1954. Anne was always a determined woman and knew this was the love of her life.\n\nTheir love story continued for 57 years of marriage. The complete love, admiration and respect they had for each other was always an example to her family and to those around them, and it continued as she held him forever in her heart.\n\nAfter getting married, Anne and Alex lived in an apartment in Ridgewood, Brooklyn until 1960 when they bought a house in Richmond Hill after having baby number two. In 1963, they welcomed a third child, siblings Karen, Alexander and Faithanne. Alex worked hard and eventually took on two jobs to move to a better environment for the family and in 1969, they moved to Malverne where they spent the next 42 years together. After Alex, the love of Anne’s life went to Heaven in 2011, she continued in the Malverne home for another 11 years. She carried on with strength, dignity, and independence. She would express that every day was a blessing, she never felt bored because she considered everything is a gift from God.\n\nShe was extremely active with volunteering in the church and community and became a familiar face to all that met her at church and throughout the town. Her contributions were many as her heart always looked to help others and she found great joy and the blessings in serving and helping others in various ways over the years in both the church and community.\n\nNotably, at her church, Our Lady of Lourdes, she served in the Rosary Altar Society, sang and participated in church musicals and in town was founding Historian of Malverne's Historical Society, Anne organized Malverne’s Centennial Ball, worked many elections, and participated in numerous functions and parades. She even played Mrs. Claus, representing the town, welcoming all the children who came. There was always a smile on her face, and she brought joy to others just by her passing touch.\n\nAnne was mom to Karen (Darrel), Alexander (Charlotte), Faithanne (Jeffrey), then became a grandma to her grandchildren and their spouses Krystina (Benny), Michael (Danielle), Alexander (Hajjera), Lauren, Jane (Bob) and later a great grandmama to Jackie, Maximus, Madelyn and Athena. She loved and cared for her children and grandchildren’s spouses as her own. Her family was her world. She had a servant heart and always put the needs of her family, friends and community before herself.\n\nAnne was gifted at the stove and good food was one of the ways that she showed love. Family meals were always an important time, and it was the gathering together that mattered. She always made more than needed and helped us all to eat more than needed! Anne ran the household, being very efficient, frugally stretching out the money allocated weekly. She’d shop smarty and drive to save a few pennies. When it came to spending and giving of gifts, Anne was always much more generous to others than to herself.\n\nLater in life when her children were grown, along with several friends, she ran a successful tag sale business and continued to show her skills and talents. If asked, Anne would say her greatest accomplishment was being a wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmama. If you met Anne once, you loved her, and she loved you. Her smile was infectious, her heart full of love, forgiveness, and positivity. She became everyone's mom, friend, and Grandma Annie because that's how she made you feel.\n\nAnne's faith, trust and love for Jesus as her Savior was strong and the cornerstone of her peace, joy and her love for her family. She was a “glass-half full” person, always optimistic, joyful, smiling, and grateful for the day. She spoke to Jesus daily and was thankful for his presence and the source of her strength thru the loss of her husband and life’s difficulties including a full recovery from lymphoma at age 88.\n\nAnne “never met a stranger” and wherever she went she made new friends. She had a way of bringing out the best in people and making them feel loved and accepted.\n\nIn August 2022, she moved to Sunrise Assisted Living in Wilton, CT, where she lived out her final 20 months. Anne loved her apartment with its big windows and view of the gardens where she said she could talk with Jesus. At Sunrise, Anne quickly made many new meaningful friendships with residents and the caring staff. She enjoyed gatherings with friends, she often played the piano and sang encouraging “sing-a-longs” although she’d say her voice wasn’t what it used to be. Little known is that she was a prayer-warrior and kept a lengthy prayer list of names for whom she prayed daily. That “little light of hers” sure did shine.\n\nIn her final days, Anne expressed gratitude for the gift of being so happy in her life and was finishing with zero regrets.\n\nShe always had a song to sing, a step to dance and the glass was always full.\n\nLife was a gift to be treasured and she made sure all around her felt it and knew it. What a beautiful life for such a wonderful woman.\n\nShe will be missed by all."
