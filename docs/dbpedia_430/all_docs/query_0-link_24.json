An additional goal of this office is to create pathways of access to students with an interest in health careers through community outreach and engagement, hosting students on our campus for the annual Open Medical School event, and the UCI MedAcademy (a five-day experience designed to introduce high school students to medical careers) designed to introduce pre-medical students to the realities of medical training and the preparation desired. The UCI School of Medicine is committed to creating a health workforce that reflects and is responsive to the diverse communities we serve by recruiting students from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with a desire to serve in the medically underserved communities in California.\n\nFor more information on the UCI MedAcademy, activities and application process:\n\nWebsite: https://medschool.uci.edu/education/summer-programs/education-summer-programs-uci-medacademy\n\nEmail: MedAcademy@uci.edu\n\nPhone: 949-824-0272\n\nMedical Student Advisor System\n\nThe School of Medicine provides a comprehensive academic advising and assistance program that spans the full duration of the students’ educational program.\n\nAcademic and Career Advisors\n\nMegan Boysen Osborn, M.D., Associate Dean, Students: mbo@hs.uci.edu\n\nKyle Paredes, M.D., Assistant Dean, Student Affairs: paredesk@hs.uci.edu\n\nNancy Guirguis, Ed.D., Assistant Dean, Student Affairs: ngirguis@hs.uci.edu\n\nChloe Courchesne, M.D., UCI School of Medicine Career Advisor: ccourche@hs.uci.edu\n\nDaniel Kang, M.D., UCI School of Medicine Career Advisor: daniek1@hs.uci.edu\n\nKari Kansal, M.D., UCI School of Medicine Career Advisor: kkansal@hs.uci.edu\n\nMaria Peralta, M.D., UCI School of Medicine Career Advisor: mvperalt@hs.uci.edu\n\nLauren Stokes, Ed.D., Director, Academic Support: lgih@hs.uci.edu\n\nShelly VanAmburg, MAEd, Learning Skills Specialist: shellyv@hs.uci.edu\n\nStudent academic performance is monitored on a weekly basis by the Student Monitoring Committee and a bi-weekly Student Success Committee. The committees discuss and develop specific action plans for each student experiencing academic difficulty. All students are also assigned a faculty Career Advisor beginning early in their first year.\n\nA four-year Career Advising Curriculum has been developed for all medical students. During the new student orientation, the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs leads a “Career Perspectives” workshop, which provides an overview of the career curriculum and introduces the AAMC Careers in Medicine program to the students. Monthly specialty workshops are provided to the first and second year classes during lunch at the Irvine campus (or held virtually) and a two-year rotating schedule of specialties has been developed. Similarly, workshops are given at the Medical Center in Orange for the third year students. The assigned Career Advisor provides academic support as well as career counseling support while the student is enrolled in the School of Medicine. Assigned Career Advisors provide guidance on factors such as elective selection and career path requirements. Students also have access to a group of faculty from various departments who have agreed to provide specialty-specific academic advice in their disciplines (Specialty Mentors).\n\nIn addition to the Career Advisors and Specialty Mentors, the students have access to services provided through the Learning Skills Specialist. Students can seek one-on-one counseling from the Learning Skills Specialist or attend workshops that have been created to improve study skills and time management.\n\nPeer Review and Peer Counseling Program\n\nMegan Boysen Osborn, M.D., Associate Dean, Students: mbo@hs.uci.edu\n\nNancy Guirguis, Ed.D., MSW Director, SOM Wellness: ngirguis@hs.uci.edu\n\nThe School of Medicine has an informal peer review process, aimed at early detection and assistance for medical students who are experiencing difficulty such as professional conduct problems, suspected impairment, violation of the honor code, or violation of any University policy, regulation, or rule. The Peer Review Committee is comprised of two representatives from each class, the student body co-presidents, and two advisory faculty members. The committee operates within guidelines set jointly by the School of Medicine administration and the student body. Cases involving serious professional misconduct are referred to the Dean’s Office. The Promotions and Honor Committee conducts hearings and may impose sanctions or provide assistance to the student.\n\nMaster of Science in Medical Science (M.S.)\n\nMegan Boysen Osborn, M.D., Associate Dean, Students: mbo@hs.uci.edu\n\nThe UCI Master of Science in Medical Science is designed to prepare the next generation of leaders in health care. Students obtain a strong foundation in anatomy and embryology, biochemistry, neuroscience, behavioral science, ethics, pathology, microbiology, and pharmacology. Students receive exposure to the health care setting and a strong foundation in interviewing and interacting with patients. The curriculum continues to meet the changing needs of medical education within the two years of instruction. Indeed, the School of Medicine faculty views curriculum development as a continual process and feels that medical education and teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum is designed to encourage medical students to become participants in their education process, to be active rather than passive learners, to become lifelong learners, and to use cooperative and team-learning principles.\n\nUCI is dedicated to the nurturing of humanistic, caring physicians and health care professionals with top-notch clinical expertise and skills.

In this context, the faculty endeavors to provide students with experiences in areas such as communication and empathy, ethics and professionalism, diversity awareness, and cultural sensitivity and medical humanities. The faculty also feels that the curriculum should strive to integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into this early phase of medical education.\n\nThe School has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of a series of “Clinical Foundations” courses. The courses are longitudinal multidisciplinary experiences broadly designed to prepare students for their future careers in health care through the application of experiential and self-directed learning principles. These courses also utilize small group learning sessions to reinforce core concepts of patient-physician interactions and introductory clinical reasoning skill development.\n\nTo satisfy the requirement for the M.S. in Medical Science degree, each medical student must successfully complete the first and second-year curriculum, elective(s) to complete a service learning project (SLP) elective. The SLP ensures that students seek knowledge to better serve the needs of the community, perform a community health assessment and intervention, and identify evidence-based strategies for providing health education to members of the community. Students must also pass a comprehensive oral examination prior to conferring of the degree.\n\nAn ongoing academic monitoring program is coordinated by the Office of Student Support, which identifies students early who might be experiencing academic difficulty and provides them with resources to successfully complete their course work. Faculty advisors are assigned to students during their first and second years. A Learning Resources Program is available to provide tutorial assistance and study skills training.\n\nGraduates of the program will be prepared to use the foundation provided in this program towards a career health care (leadership, business, or research). For the degree, students must complete at least 142 units, consisting of the following courses:\n\nFirst Year:\n\nClinical Foundations I\n\nAnatomy and Embryology\n\nBehavioral Science and Ethics 1\n\nHistology\n\nImmunology\n\nMedical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\nMedical Genetics\n\nNeuroscience\n\nPhysiology and Pathophysiology\n\nPatient and Community Engagement I\n\nSecond Year:\n\nClinical Foundations II\n\nBehavioral Science and Ethics II\n\nPathology\n\nMedical Microbiology\n\nMedical Pharmacology\n\nPatient and Community Engagement II\n\nService-Learning Project Elective (12-24 units)\n\nStudents earning the M.S. will complete a service-learning project. After or during completion of the required curriculum and SLP, students may be advanced to candidacy for the M.S. degree. Once they are a candidate for the M.S. degree, they will be required to pass a comprehensive examination. The exam will consist of a comprehensive oral examination (assessing knowledge of histology, immunology, medical genetics, neuroscience, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology, behavioral science and ethics, and/or gross anatomy and embryology). Students are required to be enrolled as a full-time student during advancement to candidacy and degree conferral for the M.S. degree.\n\nThis degree is designed for students who have completed the first two years of the curriculum, but do not plan to complete the M.D. degree.

Indeed, the School of Medicine faculty views curriculum development as a continual process and feels that medical education and teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum is designed to encourage medical students to become participants in their education process, to be active rather than passive learners, to become lifelong learners, and to use cooperative and team-learning principles.\n\nUCI is dedicated to the nurturing of humanistic, caring physicians with top-notch clinical expertise and skills. The School strives for this through a curriculum that is not only anchored in the science of medicine but also provides meaningful experiences in the humanistic dimensions of medicine. In this context, the faculty endeavors to provide students with experiences in areas such as communication and empathy, ethics and professionalism, diversity awareness, and cultural sensitivity and medical humanities. The faculty also feels that the curriculum should strive to integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into the early phases of medical education.\n\nThe School has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of a series of “Clinical Foundations” courses. The courses are longitudinal multidisciplinary experiences broadly designed to prepare students for their future careers in medicine through the application of experiential and self-directed learning principles. First-and second-year students begin to prepare for their clerkships through clinical exposures featuring standardized patients and clinical shadowing experiences. These courses also utilize small group learning sessions to reinforce core concepts of patient-physician interactions and introductory clinical reasoning skill development. During the Clinical Foundations course in the third and fourth years, students explore many of the crucial issues first presented during the introductory courses. During this segment greater emphasis is placed on advanced skill acquisition and more mature professional role development.\n\nTo satisfy the requirement for the M.D. degree, each medical student must successfully complete the full curriculum. Students must also pass both Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and successfully pass a Clinical Performance Examination (CPX) prior to graduation.\n\nAn ongoing academic monitoring program is coordinated by the Office of Student Support, which identifies students early who might be experiencing academic difficulty and provides them with resources to successfully complete their course work. Faculty advisors are assigned to students during their first and second years. Students have advisory sessions with M.D. faculty prior to the scheduling of their fourth-year course work. A Learning Resources Program is available to provide tutorial assistance and study skills training.\n\nCurricular Policies\n\nThe Curriculum and Education Policy (CEP) Committee is a committee of the Academic Senate that oversees the curriculum and governs policies pertaining to the curriculum. The CEP reviews and sets the standards of achievement for courses, clerkships, and the curriculum as a whole, and their bylaws dictate graduation requirements. The Committee on Promotions and Honors (P&H) is a standing committee of the faculty and enforces the standards of achievement and curricular policies set by the CEP Committee. P&H monitors the progress of all students throughout their educational experience.\n\nA listing of the curricular policies, as well as information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, and requirements for academic advancement, are contained in the School of Medicine Handbook, which is available at the School of Medicine Office of the Medical Education website.\n\nFirst and Second Years:\n\nBasic Science and Pre-clinical Course Work\n\nFirst Year Clinical Foundations I Anatomy and Embryology Behavioral Science and Ethics 1 Histology Immunology Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Medical Genetics Neuroscience Patient-Centered 1 Clerkship Physiology/Pathophysiology Second Year Clinical Foundations II Behavioral Science and Ethics II Pathology Medical Microbiology Medical Pharmacology Patient-Centered 2 Clerkship\n\nThird and Fourth Years1:\n\nClinical Science Course Work\n\nThird Year Clinical Foundations III General Surgery Clerkship Family Medicine Clerkship Inpatient Medicine Clerkship Neuroscience Clerkship Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship Pediatrics Clerkship Psychiatry Clerkship Radiology Clerkship Fourth Year Clinical Foundations IV Emergency Medicine Intensive Care Unit Senior Subinternship Electives\n\nCurricular Descriptions\n\nFirst-Year Curriculum\n\nClinical Foundations I\n\nClinical Foundations I, first of the four-part Clinical Foundations series, serves as the introductory clinical medicine course for first-year medical students.
