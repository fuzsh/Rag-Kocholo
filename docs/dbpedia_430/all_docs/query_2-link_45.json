He was born in Gibson County, Tennessee on July 22, 1964 to the late Jack Duncan and Baby Rose Whitfield.\n\nHe attended John Marshall High School, and went on to work in a career at M and M Transportation Company as a truck driver.\n\nHe will forever be remembered as the happy, outgoing guy whose passion was cooking, fancy cars, and loved to talk to people. Marcus’s favorite song was “Wild Thoughts By Rihanna.” He was an amazing grandfather, and spent as much time as he could with his grandchildren.\n\nA graveside service will be held on Monday, April 11, 2022 at Memorial Park Cemetery at 12PM Noon."
