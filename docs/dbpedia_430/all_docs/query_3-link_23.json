        "text": "One of the most decorated athletes UMass has ever produced, Marcus Camby is among the top basketball players in the school's storied history.\n\nCamby was named the Naismith National Player of the Year in 1996 in leading the Minutemen to the NCAA Final Four and a 35-2 record, the most successful season in program history. He was named a consensus first-team all-American that season as he averaged 20.5 points to lead the Atlantic 10.\n\nIn his three seasons at UMass, he was a two-time NABC All-District selection and All-Atlantic 10 First Team pick twice. The Minutemen won the Atlantic 10 regular-season and tournament championship in each of his three seasons. He was named the Atlantic 10 Freshman of the Year in 1994.\n\nCamby left UMass as the school's all-time leading shot blocker in a career (336) and single-season (128). Camby scored 1,387 points in his career to rank in the top 10 after his final season in Maroon & White.\n\nHe was the highest NBA Draft Pick in UMass history, being taken second overall by the Toronto Raptors in 1996. He went on to play in the NBA with the Toronto Raptors (1996-98), New York Knicks (1998-2002; 2012-13), Denver Nuggets (2002-08), Los Angeles Clippers (2008-10), Portland Trailblazers (2010-12) and Houston Rockets (2012).\n\nIn Camby's 17 seasons in the NBA, he won NBA Defensive Player of the Year (2007), was a two-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection (2007, 2008), twice picked for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team (2005, 2006), a four-time NBA blocks leader (1998, 2006â€“2008) and on the NBA All-Rookie First Team (1997).\n\nHis No. 21 jersey is retired and now hangs from the Mullins Center rafters in recognition of his success as a Minuteman and later in the NBA. Camby was named to the ESPN Silver Anniversary All-Time Atlantic 10 Team in 2004.\n\nCamby was inducted into the UMass Athletics Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2010."
