        "text": "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"The Bachelorette\" Season 21 episode 5, which aired on ABC on Aug. 5, 2024.\n\nWhat happened on \"The Bachelorette\" this week? Might be easier to answer what didn't.\n\nThere was not one, but two rose ceremonies. Two solo dates: One with a helicopter and vineyard, and the other with horseback riding and a beach. Plus, a group date where the guys had to channel their inner sheep farmers.\n\nAnd, leading lady Jenn Tran made the decision on whether she wanted her ex — who randomly showed up during last week's episode — to join her journey.\n\nOh, and one contestant decided to bow out of the competition after not yet scoring a solo date.\n\nEmotions were high, connections grew deep and Tran — a University of Wisconsin-Madison grad — said she feels confident that her future husband is one of the remaining fellas.\n\nHere's a recap of Monday night's episode:\n\n'The Bachelorette' Jenn Tran lets the guys know her ex Matt has shown up. These were their reactions.\n\nWhen Tran entered that evening's cocktail party, she sat down her remaining 11 suitors for a little chat. Just like she didn't see her ex coming, neither did they.\n\n\"I know I've talked to a lot of you about my past,\" Tran told them. \"And, my past has started to impact me in a lot more ways than I imagined.\"\n\nOn last week's episode, Tran's ex Matt flew himself to New Zealand on his own dime to tell Tran he still loves her and ask to join the group. Tran was shocked.\n\nAs she was telling the guys, many of them were visibly taken aback.\n\nYou know the saying, \"Tell me how you really feel\"? That's exactly what the guys did as soon as Tran left the room.\n\n\"This sucks. That is a gut punch to everybody sitting in that room right there,\" Sam M. said in a confessional.\n\nA fired-up Austin saidthe ex would have an unfair advantage and said it would be \"wack\" if Matt got to join the journey after everything he and the other guys had already poured into it.\n\nAnd, frontrunner Devin? He needed a drink.\n\n\"She's cried about her past, bro,\" a livid Devin said to Grant. \"Now, she's going to let her past back in her life like that so easily? And walk among us. I did this already. I've been there, bro. I ain't doing it again, bro. I ain't doing it again.\"\n\nIf Tran let Matt join the show, Devin said, the rose he was given on his date wouldn't mean anything to him and he'd leave.\n\nDid Jenn Tran let ex Matt join 'The Bachelorette'?\n\nOn a bench outside, Tran told Matt she appreciated everything he's done for her.\n\n\"It touches my heart,\" she said. \"It's not something that anyone's ever done for me.\"\n\nBut, she was confused as to why he chose now to profess his love for her.\n\n\"I mean, it's really now or never,\" he said. \"You're leaving this thing engaged. There's no flexibility there.\"\n\nThey're far different people from when they initially dated, he said, and they've been growing a strong bond since then.\n\nIn a confessional, Tran revealed that the two of them did have many great times together and that they're compatible in a lot of ways. But, she was \"torn\" between the past and present.\n\nUltimately, she gave her ex the boot. Attagirl!\n\nMatt, whose 15 minutes were just about up, would be the one to tell the guys.\n\n\"She let me know her future is in this room,\" Matt said. \"She feels confident that you guys can offer her something I can't. And, I'm just here to apologize. I'm not here to take anything away from your experience. I wish you all the best. I wish her the best.\"\n\nWhen Matt left and Tran rejoined the group, she explained that, while her ex said all the right things, he was the wrong guy.\n\n\"Looking around this room, I know that the right guy is in here,\" she said. \"I've said it before and I'll say it again. My future is in this room. My husband is in this room.\"\n\n'The Bachelorette' Season 21 Episode 5 rose ceremony No. 1: Who was sent home and who remains\n\nTran decided to send home Thomas and John.\n\nThe remaining contestants at this point of the episode were Grant, Jeremy, Jonathon, Spencer, Dylan, Austin, Marcus, Devin and Sam M.\n\n'The Bachelorette' Jenn Tran helped her date face his fears\n\nTran was the one facing her fear of heights last week. This week, she helped one of her guys face his. And, she knew exactly what not to do (cough, cough, Sam M.).\n\nWhile going on a date with Tran would top the list of things Jonathon would want to do, riding in a helicopter would be on the opposite end.\n\nBut, as he pulled up for his date, he saw that's what was about to go down.\n\n\"I hate helicopters,\" he told Tran. \"That's literally the last thing I wanted to do today. If we go down, at least we go down together.\"\n\nHis goal: To face his fear with Tran, get lost in the moment and make her feel needed. Mission accomplished, man.\n\nDuring the ascent, Tran held onto Jonathon's arm and assured him it would be OK. Throughout the flight, she continued holding on, which seemed to make him more at ease.\n\n\"You helped me get through that more than you know,\" he told Tran as they landed on the beautiful Waiheke Island. And shared a kiss, of course.\n\nTheir vineyard date was all sorts of cute, playful and light. Jonathon threw an impressive cartwheel. The two played hide-and-seek. And, they tossed grapes into each other's mouths from several feet away — also impressive.\n\n\"This day's like one of those ones you see in movies — like a rom-com,\" Jonathon said in a cutaway.\n\nWhile the pair have a giggly and goofy energy, Tran said in a confessional, they hadn't yet reached a deeper, vulnerable place. Her goal was to get there with him. Turns out, so was his.\n\nIn a wooden hot tub surrounded by breathtaking scenery, Jonathon told Tran that his biggest fear is for them not to be able to push past their fun and friendly connection. Fortunately, that fear would be crushed by night's end.\n\nTran — in a super-sparkly dress that Jonathon called beautiful — and her date reconvened over an intimate dinner.\n\nJonathon revealed to Tran why it's hard for him to fully open up and show his emotions. He once fell hard and fast for a woman. They lived together for two years, looked at rings and talked about their future together.\n\nBut that woman was going through a hard time and turned to alcohol to ease the pain, Jonathon said. When Jonathon questioned what she was doing, he said, she would call him controlling and abusive.\n\nWhen the woman ended it, though, it \"absolutely destroyed\" him to his core.\n\nWith a toxic ex (not Matt!) who gas-lit and manipulated her, Tran could relate.\n\n\"I think when you're in an emotionally abusive relationship, it really takes a toll on you and you carry that with you for a long time,\" she said. \"I can see exactly where you're coming from and the fears of emoting and the fears of fully trusting someone again because they can use that against you.\"\n\nJonathon and his siblings grew up with a single mom, he said, and the family was often faced with hardship.\n\n\"I would see the sadness and the turmoil and all I'd want to do is make them smile,\" he said.\n\nTran asked if having to put on a strong front as a kid is why he has a hard time emoting as an adult.\n\n\"Yeah, probably,\" he said.\n\nTran — who grew up with parents who fought a lot — put on a mask of her own when she was a kid, she said, which has made it harder for her to be vulnerable and show weakness.\n\n\"I just feel like I can understand you a lot better now,\" Tran told Jonathon. \"And that we can both relate on so much about how we grew up and the relationships that we were in and what we learned from it.\"\n\nShe presented him with a rose, which he accepted.\n\n\"I just feel heard,\" Jonathon said in a confessional. \"It feels great to open up about something like that and let her know where I stand. She happens to be on the same ladder that I'm on and she just helped me get to the next step.\"\n\nThere's that saying about rain on your wedding day being good luck. How about on a one-on-one? As the two kissed passionately, the skies opened.\n\nJust when we thought it couldn't get any more movie-esque, Jonathon gave Tran a twirl. Stahhhhpppp.\n\nIt was men vs. sheep on the group date. Who would be named MVF (most valuable farmer)?\n\nCue the sheep.\n\nDevin, Sam, Marcus, Spencer, Jeremy, Dylan, Austin — in their finest flannels — met up with Tran — dripped out in denim — on a sheep farm.\n\nRichard and Dianne — the farm's owners, who have been married for over 45 years — were looking for the most valuable farmer. He'd be awarded with a little extra time with Tran.\n\nThe guys had to work together to corral hundreds of sheep and get them through a wooden gate. But, somehow, they didn't think to open said gate. Chaos ensued, with sheep dashing and leaping all over the place.\n\nTheir next challenge: Shoveling sheep poop and muck into buckets. Devin and Jenn rewarded themselves with a little break to chat. The other guys did not like that one bit. But, that was exactly the kind of initiative Tran was looking for.\n\nAnd, the fun just didn't quit. Next, the men were asked to cut dingleberries off the sheep. Yes, really.\n\nRichard and Dianne's verdict? They thought Devin would make a good farmer AND partner, so he was awarded the extra time with Tran.\n\nThe other guys, especially Austin and apparently Jeremy, were bitter about it.\n\n\"Devin, you think you deserved farmer of the day? Honest answer,\" Jeremy asked at the after party.\n\n\"For me, I think it was more about initiative of doing what I've always been doing,\" Devin said.\n\n\"That's really insightful,\" Jeremy replied, full of deadpan sarcasm.\n\n\"I know it's pretty basic, but it means a lot, you know?\" Devin responded.\n\n\"Yeah!\" Jeremy flashed a big, fake smile that immediately switched back to a straight face.\n\nDuring Jeremy's and Tran's alone time later, he was petting her head while they talked about the frat he was in during college. When she asked why he was petting her, the two burst into laughter.\n\nBut, the conversation quickly took a serious turn.\n\nJeremy told Tran that he's insecure and afraid of being lonely, which he said he's never told anyone before. They both expressed their fears of putting too much into a relationship and that not being reciprocated.\n\nAfter sharing sweet kisses, Jeremy started petting Tran's head — again.\n\nAfter not yet receiving a one-on-one, this contestant decided to leave. That left Jenn Tran questioning her worth.\n\nAustin, who hadn't yet received a one-on-one with Tran, dropped quite the truth bomb on her at the party. He felt like he had been playing catch-up the whole time.\n\n\"You have some amazing guys here that are ready to give you absolutely everything that you deserve,\" he said. \"And, with the way that things have gone for me in this journey, I don't think that I can do that.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" she asked him.\n\n\"I'm saying I don't think it's fair to you and I don't think it's fair to the other guys that I continue this journey with you,\" he said.\n\nWhile Tran seemed to be experiencing a mix of shock, confusion, frustration and hurt, she respected his decision and the two hugged it out.\n\nAn emotional Tran was left feeling like she was not enough and had failed.\n\nBravely, she brought those feelings up to the rest of the guys. Spencer and Sam M. jumped in with support for her before Sam M. pulled her aside.\n\n\"You don't think it makes you look at me differently?\" Tran asked him.\n\n\"What would I look at you differently for?\" Sam asked.\n\nWhen she lets down her strong, confident daredevil front, Tran said, a side of her she doesn't love shows.\n\n\"If I let my guard down, would you still still be able to love me?\" Sam asked her.\n\nAs she shook her head yes, he said: \"So, my answer is the same.\"\n\nWhen Marcus got time with Tran, he said he could be \"a mirror\" for her as long as he's around to show her the incredible woman that she is.\n\n\"When I think of someone I can rely on, it's always you,\" Tran told him. \"And, I always look forward to every conversation that we have and every moment that we have together. And, I just want you to know that.\"\n\nAs Tran hung on Devin, he said he didn't know what she went through to make her feel unworthy of being chosen, but that she's \"worthy and more.\"\n\n\"If it's not me that shows you, someone here will show you that,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you for being here for me,\" she said.\n\n\"I couldn't be anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nSince all of the guys showed up for her and accepted her with open arms, she decided it would be unfair to hand out a group date rose that night.\n\n'The Bachelorette' Jenn Tran finds 'a true partnership' with Grant after horseback riding on a beach and getting vulnerable\n\nGrant — who Tran is very attracted to — greeted his date by sweeping her off her feet ... literally.\n\nThey rode horses along on Muriwai Beach, which Tran called \"the perfect place to fall in love.\" But with the strength of her other connections top of mind, she knew there was a lot of pressure to delve deeper with Grant.\n\nThe two cozied up on a blanket under an umbrella as it rained. Having heard about the emotional group date from the other guys, Grant let Tran know she doesn't have to be perfect with him.\n\nGrowing up, Grant's dad was \"everything\" to him and the person he trusted the most. But, his dad was also battling addiction and would lie to him often, Grant said.\n\nJust before Grant left for filming, he said, his dad got fired and ended up checking into rehab. He's two months sober.\n\n\"I hope he holds strong,\" Grant said. \"It's his first time living, too.\"\n\nTran — who's working toward becoming a physician assistant — said Grant's willingness to be there for his dad must mean so much to him.\n\n\"That speaks volumes to who you are as a person,\" Tran said. \"I can't imagine the weight you had to bear with all of that going on growing up. My heart goes out to you.\"\n\nThat meant a lot to Grant, whose mission in life is to \"be the man that my father wasn't.\"\n\nTran felt silenced and chained up in her past toxic relationship, she shared with Grant. When sensitive topics would arise, including racism, Tran said, her ex would gas-light her by saying she was wrong and that racism is fake.\n\nGrant felt the two of them had a lot in common and encouraged her to always speak her mind, especially for things worth fighting for.\n\n\"It feels like a true partnership,\" Tran said in a confessional. \"And, I just feel like he really accepts me for who I am so far and it feels really good to have someone do that ... I feel closer to Grant. I feel aligned with Grant. I feel like Grant has a lot of the things that I am looking for.\"\n\nShe gave him a date rose — which matched his shirt, BTW — which he accepted. The two capped off the night with kisses.\n\nAnother rose ceremony: Who went home and who stayed?\n\nAt the cocktail party the next day, Grant confessed to the rest of the guys that he's falling in love with Tran.\n\nIn the words of Jeremy, that made the mood \"more tense and emotional.\"\n\nTran — in another sparkly number — let the guys know she would be bypassing the party and going right into the rose ceremony.\n\n\"I know I'm exactly where I need to be,\" she said. \"I know exactly what I'm looking for.\"\n\nTran would end up sending Dylan home.\n\nHere's who remains heading into Week 6: Sam, Devin, Marcus, Jeremy, Spencer, Grant and John.\n\nHow to watch 'The Bachelorette' Season 21\n\n\"The Bachelorette\" Season 21 airs at 7 p.m. CT Mondays on ABC. It streams on Hulu the next day."
