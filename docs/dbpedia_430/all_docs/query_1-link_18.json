        "text": "Introducing: Moore Aluminaries\n\nIn honor of Moore’s 175th anniversary year, we are proud to present a new series that celebrates some of the College’s most accomplished and inspiring graduates, from the early days to the present.\n\nWe have dubbed these distinguished Moore alumni “ALUMINARIES,” to celebrate the light they have brought and will continue to bring to the world through their brilliant achievements and pioneering work in the art and design fields.\n\nMeet some of our first Aluminaries below and click here to read their full stories. Be sure to follow us on social media @moorecollegeart to keep up with future entries in the series.\n\nMoore Milestones\n\nMoore in the News\n\nIn her first year at Moore, President Cathy Young has championed the College’s role as a nimble, innovative and uniquely Philadelphian institution, and her impact has not gone unnoticed. The Philadelphia Business Journal named Young a 2023 Woman of Influence back in August, and another Philadelphia Business Journal feature from this summer underscores her role in harnessing the incredible potential at Moore today. Exploring the far-reaching and future-forward strategic plan that will be presented in May 2024, the story highlights some of the new initiatives that are already in motion—such as the VAULT space that supports thriving student interest in animation and video game design—and possibilities for capital projects built around sustainability, diversity and wellness.\n\nIn November, Moore was featured in the Philadelphia Inquirer as a leader among historically women’s colleges for the College’s recent enrollment successes and financial strength, and our approach to embracing and providing a nurturing learning environment for nonbinary and gender-nonconforming students. This updated admissions policy is a natural evolution of Moore’s ongoing mission to support individuals who are historically underrepresented in creative fields.\n\nPew Center Grant Supports Innovation with Michelle Lopez\n\nMoore has received a $360,500 grant from The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage to present Michelle Lopez: Pandemonium in the fall of 2025, in partnership with the Franklin Institute. Lopez’ work pushes the boundaries of sculpture, exploring and critiquing our collapsing built environment through a minority-Brown lens. Pandemonium will use virtual reality sculpture, a new method for Lopez and the art world at large, to envelop viewers in a dynamic “cloud” of material and digital debris that encourages reflection on systemic collapse and climate crisis. Situated at the intersection of art and technology, Lopez’ sculptural experimentation is an insightful match for Moore as a site of innovation in the arts.\n\nThe two-pronged multimedia installation will be on view concurrently at the Fels Planetarium of the Franklin Institute and The Galleries at Moore, where a solo/retrospective exhibition of the artist’s sculptural work will contextualize the virtual conflagration that is Pandemonium. The project represents the first collaboration of its kind between Moore and the neighboring Franklin Institute.\n\nCelebrating Alumni Every Day\n\nA brand-new rotating gallery space dedicated to Moore alumni opened over the summer with an energetic celebration featuring live performances in jazz, spoken word and dance. The opening reception showcased the inaugural exhibition of work from Anne Canfield ’99, Caronia Marín Hernández ’22, Darla Jackson ’03, Julie Miller ’68, Terri Saulin ’92 and Kathy Shaver ’83.\n\nDevoting close to 500 square feet within The Galleries at Moore, with nearly 40 feet of public-facing frontage on Race Street, the new alumni gallery is a celebration of the Moore community’s wealth of artistic talent across different mediums and viewpoints. The exhibit space, physically connected to The Art Shop at Moore, will rotate every 6–8 weeks to feature a diverse representation of alumni working in a variety of artistic disciplines, and will serve as a platform for alumni programs and events. Now and up next: work from Emily Whynott MFA ’23 (on view through January 20), Naomieh Jovin ’17, and Jill Bell ’96.\n\nMoore Students Shine at the Governor’s Residence\n\nAt the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence, a Pride Month exhibition brought visibility to LGBTQ+ identities and perspectives at Moore, with nine students’ paintings, drawings and prints hanging right outside the Governor and First Lady’s offices all summer long. The artworks—by Kaylee Corbi ’26, Courtney Drake ’26, AJ Durden ’25, Symphony Hodge ’25, Sam Irvin ’26, Sarah Lesnikoski ’23, Magdalene Sanchez ’26, Brooklyn Smith ’25 and an additional anonymous student—represented the relationship between identity and art-making, inspired by each student’s unique experiences and influences.\n\nThe inclusion of the students’ work at the Governor’s Residence speaks to the importance of LGBTQ+ voices in Pennsylvania, as well as the power of art to make an impact on social issues. Corbi, Durden, Smith and Drake had the opportunity to talk about their work with Governor Shapiro in a private reception at the Residence in August, where each student spoke about their processes and inspiration."
