        "text": "At the height of his career with the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan juggled being a professional basketball player and a father of three.\n\nThe NBA legend welcomed Marcus, his second son, in December 1990 with his then-wife Juanita Vanoy. The couple, who were married from 1989 to 2006, share two other children, Jeffrey and Jasmine. Marcus also has siblings, Victoria and Ysabel, from Michael's second marriage to Yvette Prieto.\n\nAfter a childhood of watching Michael's games, Marcus followed in his dad's footsteps, beginning with playing basketball in his youth.\n\nOn his podcast, Separation Anxiety, the younger Jordan mentioned that his father's career in the NBA meant that Michael couldn’t always cheer him on, but it didn't take away from their relationship.\n\n“My dad wasn’t there all the time, for every basketball game that I had,” Marcus said. “He had his own schedule, but he did a good job of supporting me while I was on the road or making sure he came to as many games as he could.”\n\nHere’s everything to know about Michael Jordan’s son, Marcus Jordan.\n\nHe grew up in Chicago\n\nMichael and Vanoy welcomed their son Marcus on Dec. 24, 1990. He and his siblings were raised in Chicago, where Michael played for the Bulls.\n\nSpeaking with TMZ Sports in May 2020, Marcus said his father's fame made for a unique upbringing. Although he and his siblings enjoyed one-of-a-kind opportunities, they also attended public school and were close with their extended family.\n\n“I say 'relative' because I didn't take my first commercial flight until I was a junior in high school. I grew up playing PlayStation on a private jet,” he said. “So it's not normal. But my mom, she's from the South Side of Chicago, she made sure that we stayed grounded and visited my cousins on the South Side a lot.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Marcus revealed that although he “didn’t really miss out on much” growing up in a famous family, his parents were “so private” that he didn’t have many close friends who shared his experience.\n\n\"As I got older, I wished that my parents helped us make connections with other celebrity kids,” he said in an August 2023 episode of Separation Anxiety. “Growing up in Chicago in the suburbs, there’s not that many celebrity kids that live out there. But we definitely grew up with other high-net-worth families. But as you get older, you look back for some of those more solid friendships.”\n\nHe played basketball in high school and college\n\nMarcus followed in his dad’s footsteps and played basketball in high school and college. He started his career at Loyola Academy and Whitney Young High School before graduating and playing at the University of Central Florida from 2009 to 2012.\n\nDuring an interview with The Gainesville Sun in February 2011, Marcus said he was immediately drawn to UCF when it came time to pick a college.\n\n“It was the first and last visit I made,\" he said. \"I just loved it. The facilities were new and it was definitely a place where I could go in and play right away.\"\n\nMarcus also mentioned that Michael offered him some advice for playing college basketball.\n\n“[He] knew how dedicated I was to really just getting my game to the next level,” Marcus explained to the outlet. “He was giving me tips and pointers whenever I had questions and stuff like that, but really he was just telling me to be focused and work hard every day, because eventually it will pay off.\"\n\nIn 2013, Marcus graduated from UCF with a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management.\n\nHe’s competitive\n\nSpeaking with the Chicago Sun-Times in May 2020, Marcus shared that he and his siblings also have their dad’s competitive nature.\n\n“For us, we’re all naturally competitive. We all got that gene,” he said. “At times when we would play basketball, there would definitely be some competitive moments in the gym, talking trash or whatever the case may be.”\n\nThat same month, Marcus and his brother Jeffrey shared on The Breakfast Club radio show that although they would often play competitive games with their dad, Michael was still their parent.\n\n\"He definitely could turn that off and be dad,\" Jeffrey said. \"Take us to school ... make sure we got our work done and everything we needed to do. But when it was on, it was on. It was competition.\"\n\nHe founded a boutique in 2016\n\nIn 2016, Marcus opened Trophy Room, a high-end sneaker boutique, in Orlando, Florida. The entrepreneur told the Chicago Sun-Times in May 2020 that the inspiration for the boutique’s name came from a special spot inside the Jordan household.\n\n“Trophy Room is inspired by the trophy room that was in our house growing up,” he said. “Anytime we won an award, my dad would put our trophies in there among his. So it really just inspired us as kids to go out and do our own thing and earn our own accolades.”\n\nWhen Marcus initially brought the idea to his dad to secure funding, Michael wasn’t convinced the business would work because his son had never run a store. Marcus told Bleacher Report in 2017 that he partnered with boutique owner James Whitner before approaching his father again with a solid plan.\n\n“There are so many places that offer unique items, but we wanted to provide an experience,\" Marcus said of the establishment that features childhood photos along the walls. \"We want to walk people through the legacy of Jordan Brand, my father's history while also telling our side of things.\"\n\nIn May 2023, Marcus celebrated seven years of his sneaker boutique. “Today is a special day. 5.23.23 celebrates 7 years of TROPHY ROOM™️ 🏆,” he wrote on Instagram alongside photos of himself and Michael in the store.\n\nHe is dating Larsa Pippen\n\nMarcus and Larsa Pippen, who have been dating since 2022, hit a rough patch in February 2024. The couple called it quits for a few days before reuniting on Valentine's Day. That evening, fans couldn't help but notice the statement Larsa made when she wore a white dress and a massive diamond ring on that finger for date night.\n\nThe pair officially confirmed their romance in January 2023 after being spotted in Miami together.\n\nA month later, Larsa opened up to PEOPLE about the moment her friendship with Marcus turned romantic. According to The Real Housewives of Miami star, they met through mutual friends at a Los Angeles party in 2019 and built \"a great foundation as friends.\"\n\n“I think it was one night we went out, and there was a girl that was there. She was trying to talk to him, and I was getting jealous over it,\" she said. \"And it was weird because I'm not really the jealous person, but I was jealous over the situation.\"\n\nLarsa continued, \"And so then, I was thinking maybe I do really like him. That kind of sealed the deal.\"\n\nDue to their 16-year age gap and Larsa’s ex-husband being Michael’s former teammate, Scottie Pippen, the couple faced some criticism. Still, Marcus always said his loved ones were supportive of his relationship.\n\n“We spent Thanksgiving together last year, and my family loves her. They think she's great,” he revealed during a joint interview with Larsa on Entertainment Tonight in July 2023. “And ultimately, I think my family just wants to see me happy. And so as long as I'm happy, they're happy with whoever I’m dating.\"\n\nHe and Larsa launched a podcast together\n\nIn June 2023, Marcus and Larsa launched their joint podcast, Separation Anxiety.\n\nDuring one episode, Marcus touched on his formative years being raised by a famous athlete.\n\n“I cherish my upbringing around the NBA,\" he said about Michael. \"I feel like there’s a lot of great habits and traits that are instilled in you being around the NBA and playing basketball coming up.\"\n\nMarcus added, \"I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I think there’s a lot of fond memories that I have as a kid, going to the games.”\n\nHe likes to play golf\n\nSpeaking with TMZ Sports in May 2020, the Trophy Room founder revealed that despite his dad’s career in basketball, the two mainly play golf together.\n\n“These days, we’re more competitive on the golf course side,” he said. “He [Michael] didn’t build a basketball court in his new house, and obviously, he just opened his golf course in February. So, you know I’ve been playing a little golf. He’s got a head start on me, but I’ll catch him eventually.”\n\nIn July 2023, Marcus participated in DJ Khaled's inaugural We the Best Foundation Golf Classic in Miami.\n\nHe appeared on The Traitors\n\nMarcus and Larsa appeared on season 2 of The Traitors.\n\nIn January 2024, Marcus opened up to PEOPLE about being a competitor on the show."
