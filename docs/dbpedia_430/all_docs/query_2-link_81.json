        "text": "Over the past couple of years, Warren Central High School’s defensive line has been a solid contributor to the Vikings’ success. The “Big 3” consists of Larry Reynolds Jr., Ronnie Blossom, and TK Qualls who have all caused havoc on the football field.\n\nLJ Reynolds\n\nReynolds is a rising senior with a reputation for being able to beat out any offensive line that steps in front of him. His skills have led WC’s varsity team to greatness over the last two seasons as he’s prepared for his final year.\n\n“We have a bunch of seniors and we got some new pieces that have stepped up in places that we needed,” Reynolds said.\n\nThe Vikings made it to the second round of the playoffs last year as Reynolds boasted 79 tackles, 58 solos, three sacks, two forced fumbles, and two pass deflections. Although 2023 was a success, LJ has bigger plans for WC in 2024.\n\n“State Championship, it’s as simple as that,” Reynolds said.\n\nReynolds made both the All-County and All-District Teams in the previous years. He also received scholarships from both Grambling and Mississippi Valley State University and has chosen MVSU as his next destination.\n\nTK Qualls\n\nQualls was the sleeping giant who woke up in 2023. He quickly made splitting two offensive linemen to get to the ball carrier look easy as he couldn’t be stopped. He’s also looking forward to 2024 as he predicts the Vikings’ to go all the way.\n\n“We have a good senior class this year and we’re going undefeated,” TK said.\n\nTK’s motor is what keeps him explosive and able to shoot off the ball with no hesitation to get in the backfield. Only playing in nine games last season, Qualls still managed to grab 74 tackles, 47 solos, and five forced fumbles.\n\nDue to a productive season last year, TK has now received offers from Northwest Mississippi CC, Coahoma CC, Co-Lin, and Southwest Mississippi CC.\n\nRonnie Blossom:\n\nRonnie Blossom is one of WC’s biggest recruits and it shows every time he touches the field. His ability to eye everything from the ball carrier to the wide receivers is what makes his game special.\n\nAs WC had successful seasons with his over the last two years, he plans on making 2024 the best one yet.\n\n“We going to run through everybody just like we did last year but we plan to win it all this year,” Blossom said.\n\nLast season, Ronnie racked up 88 tackles, 59 solos, two sacks, seven pass deflections, and two fumble recoveries. Blossom’s undeniable talent has earned scholarships to the University of Central Arkansas, Grambling, Louisiana-Lafayette, Arkansas State, and many more schools.\n\nBlossom, Reynolds, and Qualls are all under the leadership of Head Coach Josh Morgan where they are set to begin their season in less than a month."
