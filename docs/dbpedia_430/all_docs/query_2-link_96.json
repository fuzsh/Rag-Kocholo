        "text": "Donald Julian Marcus, 93 years old of Monroe, Louisiana, devoted son of Abram and Esther Marcus, was born on July 21, 1930, and passed away on February 11, 2024, at 11:00 PM.\n\nHe was the beloved husband of Phyllis Marcus (nee Tolchinsky) for 69 happy years and caring devoted father of Paul Marcus (Ina), Audrey Marcus Giglio (Don) and Elliot Bruce Marcus, deceased.\n\nDon was also the beloved son in law of Louis and Selma Tolchinsky who loved and welcomed him as their son, and Don was like a brother to Harriet and Allan.\n\nDon was a loving grandfather of Loni Marcus Schnitzer (Jordan), Ricky Marcus (Lindsay), Carlie Rose Marcus (deceased) Michael Giglio (Katelyn), Katie Giglio Howe (Chance), Aaron Marcus (Rochelle), Joshua Marcus (Ewin), and Noah Marcus. Don was great grandfather to Claire and Zachary Schnitzer, Jaryn and Arlo Marcus, Christine and Colleen Giglio, Lily Rose Howe and Eliza Marcus.\n\nDon and Phyllis met on St. Patrick’s Day while attending a wedding in 1951. Their first date was July 4th, 1951, and the rest is history. Don was drafted into the U.S. Army and after basic training, Don was sent to Fontainebleau, France where he was a nurse and Phyllis waited for him faithfully. He returned home in January 1954, and they were married and joined together on April 4th, 1954.\n\nDon attended Cleveland College but dropped out to help his mother after his father had a stroke and passed away.\n\nDon and Phyllis were deeply involved in their religion. They are members of Congregation B’nai Israel, Monroe, Louisiana. Don served as president of the congregation and started a Men’s Club, but most important to the two of them, brought music to the Temple for eight years. This was to raise money for the Jewish Cemetery.\n\nPhyllis was the Temple administrator for 25 years.\n\nFuneral service celebrating the life of Donald J. Marcus will be at 1:00 PM, Thursday, February 15, 2024, in the chapel at Mulhearn Funeral Home in Monroe with Rabbi Judy Ginsburgh officiating. Interment will follow in the Jewish Cemetery. Visitation will be from 12:00 noon until service time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to The Wounded Warriors, Anti-Defamation League, or the charity of your choice."
