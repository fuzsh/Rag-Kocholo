        "text": "\"I love Rassie Erasmus, the current director of rugby and former coach of the Springboks. He encapsulates what South Africans should and could be like. Rassie is not from the mansions of Waterkloof in Pretoria or Stellenbosch but from the Afrikaner working class area of Despatch just outside Gqberha. The M-Net documentary, Chasing the Sun, which tracks the Springboks in their successful efforts to win the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, provides a brilliant insight of Rassie’s philosophy. As the team prepares for the world cup, Rassie seemingly decides to tackle the matter of racial diversity. He does not tackle it head-on. He does not deflect responsibility to the administrators of the South African Rugby Union (Saru) or to politicians. In the most genuine and honest way, he gets all of the players to understand that no matter their backgrounds, they all have sacrificed to be selected for the squad. He gets black players to elaborate on where they come from — like Makazole Mapimpi, who was raised by his grandmother in a single-roomed hut in the former Transkei area of the Eastern Cape. The white players, who may not have endured the financial and economic hardships of their black counterparts, also sacrificed. Their parents worked two or three jobs, so they could go to certain schools. Through this process, the players begin to understand and empathise with each other’s backgrounds and the sacrifices they each made. This not only builds healthy respect, but also genuine friendship and loyalty. But Rassie did not just stop there. He then related them to the whole country — and spoke of where we have come from and what we currently endure. Therefore, whatever happens on the field cannot be worse than what we have all experienced in our lives. He effectively uses the trauma we have lived through as testimony of our remarkableness, not as a weakness. There is no space for victims, just victors. Rassie is able to get this group of players to drop their differences and become one team centred on being South African. South Africans have to come together, otherwise we will not be able to tackle the problems in this country. It requires us to walk that extra mile towards each other, as opposed to waiting to see what the other will do. The Springboks showed us what is possible in 2019. Many of us believe that they can repeat that feat in this year’s Rugby World Cup. We believe that because we know the players and coaches are one single unit. We need to relinquish our own misconceptions about each other and be one team. We need leaders like Rassie Erasmus, who are unafraid to admit that there is a crisis, and then to take a risk on us and believe that we can and will pull together. If we do that we can win our own world cup against poverty, inequality and unemployment. #southafrica #leadership #StrongerTogether"
