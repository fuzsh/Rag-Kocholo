He was the oldest living member of the Telephone Pioneers of America.\n\nA former resident of Concord for many years, he was a founder of the Concord Co- operative Bank and a member of the school committee. Through the years he was active in the Masons, and the Congregational Church. He served the Class of 1890 as class secretary, treasurer, and class agent.\n\nHis wife, the former Mary Florence Fletcher, whom he married on March 28, 1900 in South Acton, Mass., died in 1935. He is survived by his son Robert Fletcher Charles ’23, with whom he lived.\n\nHis last visit to Hanover was on August 8, 1960, when Will was accompanied by his nurse.\n\n1898\n\nReverend Everard Walker Snow of River St., Norwell, Mass., died on June 29 at a nursing home in Hingham, Mass. “Ev,” as his classmates affectionately called him, was born in New Haven, Conn., January 5, 1875. He attended schools in Washington, D. C., and also received private instruction. In college he was a member of Theta Delta Chi, Phi Beta Kappa, was active in the Y.M.C.A., editor of Aegis, and class presi- dent in our freshman year. After graduation he attended Hartford Theological Seminary, receiving the degree of B.D. in 1901. On January 10, 1906 he married Ruth Caroline Barry in Boston, Mass.\n\nHis professional career was long and var- ied. He was head of the history and eco- nomics department of Talladega (Mission- ary) College in Alabama from 1916 to 1920 and instructor in Burdette College, Boston from 1920 to 1940. His pastorates included Congregational churches in Roxbury, Mass.; Beverly, Mass.; West Bridgewater, Mass.; South Natick, Mass.; Winsted, Conn.; and the Stratham Community Church in N. H.\n\n“Ev” was a loyal member of the Class and until a fractured hip and other infirmi- ties of himself and Mrs. Snow made travel- ing difficult, attended with her all our re- unions. He exercised a calm influence over us all, often being called upon to iron out the frictions which often arise among men strong and differing natures.\n\nRev. Warren A. Leonard officiated at the private funeral services at the Shepperd Fu- neral Home, Pembroke, Mass., July 1. “Ev” is survived by his widow now in failing health and two daughters and two grand- sons. His brothers were the late Dr. S. Dry- uen Snow ’97, and the late Hubert M. ’Ol, father of Dryden M. ’32.\n\n1901\n\nWilliam Whittle Cheever was born in Nashua, N. H., on August 5, 1876. He en- tered Dartmouth from Nashua High School in the fall of 1897, and graduated from there with the Class of 1901 in June 1901. While in college, he was a good student, popular with his classmates, often called “The General” because of his upright pos- ture and neat appearance. He was fond of the outdoor life and spent much of his lei- sure time tramping about the countryside or canoeing on the river, in the spring or fall, and skating or snowshoeing in the win- ter. He was a member of Sigma Chi frater- nity.\n\nBecause of his fondness for outdoor life, he entered the government forestry service shortly after his graduation from college, and spent his summers working in the for- ests of New England, and his winters in those of the southern states. After several years of this work he was obliged to give it up because of poor health, and he re- turned to Nashua, where he married Annie Gillis, of Manchester, N. H., in about 1910. She died about twenty-five years later. They did not have any children.\n\nDuring these years, he made several busi- ness ventures, but soon after his wife’s death he decided he was not suited for a business career, and in 1942 he took a position in the steward’s department of the Charles V. Chapin Hospital in Providence, R. 1., where he was happy and contented until 1956. when he was retired because of his age. He continued to live in Providence, at 48 Rad- cliffe Avenue and after a short illness he died there on December 18, 1961.\n\nBill was always of cheerful disposition: temperate and upright, a fine citizen and a good friend, much beloved by those who were close friends.\n\n1904\n\nJohn Henry Watson Jr., senior partner in the law firm of M.

His associates in the law firm of Johnson and Johnson were the late David L. Johnson ’lO, and David Johnson Jr. ’35.\n\nIn a careful check of some fifteen class reports, it would be difficult to find any ref- erences to John’s activities. He never was given to mentioning the successes which he had achieved. Perhaps the most brilliant, modest, successful man in the class, and too, one of the most generous givers to the 1904 Class Alumni Fund, “Watty,” to us, of 1904 is a great loss to Class and College, as well as to the city of Cleveland where he has been held in the highest esteem.\n\n1905\n\nThomas Frank Eastman died May 2 at the Moore General Hospital in Grasmere, N H after a brief illness.

He frequently heard cases in the Superior Court, often in appeal.\n\n“Perhaps the greatest tribute paid to Judge Callan came from attorneys, who often waived the right to a jury in a criminal trial so the jurist could rule directly on the evidence.. .\n\nSurvivors include his wife the former Bertha M. Gibney, whom he married Oc- tober 12, 1929 in Pawtucket, R. I.; a son, Atty. Paul Callan of Middleboro; a daugh- ter, Mrs. Michael O’Connell; one sister; one brother and three grandchildren.\n\nWord comes from Palma de Mallorca of the death of Stanford Church Richmond, formerly of Wellesley Hills, at his Spanish home on July 23. The Richmonds left Wellesley four years ago after spending all their married life in that city. Stan had suf- fered from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBorn in Brockton, Mass., June 9, 1901, he prepared at the local high school and Phillips Andover Academy. Stan was a member of Green- Key and Phi Kappa Psi and one of our most enthusiastic skiers. He was in the woolen business from the time of graduation. In 1935 he became wool buyer for Prouvost-Lefebre Cos., worsted top makers, and then proprietor of his own woolen brokerage business in Boston.\n\nEleanor P. Adkins married Stan on June 22, 1928 in Cambridge, Mass. She survives him as does one daughter, Marcia Judith.\n\n1924\n\nEven though there had been one previous warning, John Scrafford Mauk had seemed to be in the best of health although restricted as to exercise and diet; had been on a cruise to Australia last winter; planned to attend the fall reunion, and then a South American cruise. Another heart attack, early >n the morning of July 19, was too much tor Johnnie. I can do no better than to re- Peat the words of one of his close friends m the class: “Dartmouth and the Class of 1924 were among his greatest loyalties. We have lost a very devoted classmate.” I know many may wish to express their own feel- ings in accordance with the family’s wishes: a contribution to either the John S. Mauk Memorial Fund, Dartmouth College; or to the Washington State Heart Fund.\n\nJohn prepared for Dartmouth at Phillips Exeter Academy. He was born on August 11, 1901 in Toledo, Ohio. While in college, he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi and the Jack O’Lantern staff. His hobbies were and have continued to be tennis, golf, fly fishing, and more recently yachting. These active sports were reflected in membership in the University Club, the Seattle Tennis and Yacht Clubs, and the Overlake Golf Club.\n\nHe and the former Elsbeth Young main- tained a close-knit family, with three mar- ried children and eight grandchildren living nearby. He was also survived by a sister and two brothers, one, Stanley D. a member of ’l9. John also had a brother-in-law, H. L. Jones ’25; a cousin, John P. Straight ’26, and two nephews, Clinton and Robert Mor- ris Mauk both in the Class of 1950.\n\nLumber has been a family business, and so John started in Toledo where he stayed one year in the C. A. Mauk Lumber Cos. In 1927 he moved to Seattle to be with the Mauk Seattle Lumber Cos., with whom he served as president from 1932 to his elec- tion as Chairman of the Board in 1960. Success here brought him other honors; president of Fortson Mill Cos.; vice-pres- ident of Conifer Timber Cos,; director of Three Rivers Plywood and Lumber Cos.; also past director of National American Wholesale Lumber Assn. Other offices in- cluded treasurer of the Planned Parenthood Center; president of the Seattle Alumni Assn.; and member for two terms of the Dartmouth Alumni Council (1950-1954).\n\nThis was an active personality, and Dart- mouth benefited greatly from his energetic carrying out of his interests. He will be greatly missed by many in the Dartmouth Fellowship as well as in his business and community activities.\n\n1926\n\nThe death of Leonard Hadley on July 14 at the Concord (N. H.) Hospital was very sudden and unexpected due to an acute coronary thrombosis. Following his gradua- tion from Dartmouth, and the Thayer School of Engineering (’2B), Len immediately started his lifetime career as an engineer in the highway department of the state of New Hampshire. For the last 25 years he was with the right-of-way division of the New Hampshire Department of Public Works and Highway.\n\nLen was a veteran of World War II; a member of Concord Post, American Legion; the American Society of State Highway offi- cials.\n\nLen’s quiet and unassuming ways while an undergraduate carried on through his entire lifetime. He was always a home-lov- ing man. Survivors include his wife, Mrs. lune (Orr) Hadley, a son. Peter Elkins, and a daughter, Deborah Elkins, all of Con- cord. To them we extend our sincerest sym- pathy.\n\nA long-awaited European trip ended tragically when Stephen Hopkins Millard died suddenly in his sleep at Lucerne, Swit- zerland on lune 19. Steve and his wife Ruth had flown by jet to London on lune 4, and were scheduled to fly home from Rome on lune 30. Memorial services, held on lune 25 at the Congregational Church, Rockville Centre, Long Island, were attended by many of Steve’s personal friends and business as- sociates. The Class of ’26 was represented by F. Sanford Martyn. T . I I .1 _ « ort Tt fl ~1 r \"t C\n\nBorn in North Adams, Mass., January 15, 1903, Steve graduated from Drury High School in North Adams. While at Dart- mouth he was manager of the Ski Team, member of Cabin and Trail, the Ledyard Canoe Club, and Zeta Psi Fraternity. Steve was very active in his devotion to Dart- mouth, notably as chairman of the alumni interviewing committee for the Long Island area for more than ten years. He attended most of the greater New York alumni gatherings and class reunions.\n\nSteve spent eight years with National City Bank of New York, and in 1934 he went to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, first as Cashier, then as Bursar, and from 1948 on as Busi- ness Manager. As the President’s Executive Officer, Steve was in charge of every busi- ness operating department at Pratt, including the Bursar’s Office, Buildings and Grounds, Student and Faculty Restaurants, Bookstore, Purchasing and Publicity. During the past several years a City Urban Renewal Pro- gram, involving an entire new campus for Pratt Institute, absorbed much of his time and energy. He loved this creative work and was very happy in it. At Pratt there was an unusual relationship between Steve, as Business Manager, and the faculty lead- ers. He was a competent financial officer who readily obtained and enjoyed easy com- munication with the several Deans and de- partment heads. A Pratt Institute colleague writes “His loss is irreparable. His in- tegrity was unquestionable and he gave so much to others. He was one of the finest and kindest men that ever lived.” What higher tribute might one receive?\n\nIn addition to active membership in nu- merous civic associations in Brooklyn, Steve was also active in his home community of Merrick, Long Island. He served his church for many years as Benevolence Chairman, Deacon, Trustee, and jointly with his wife Ruth, as presidents of a large and active Mr. and Mrs. Club.\n\nSteve will always be remembered for the cheering warmth of his personal contacts, and the depth of his understanding of, and respect for, the other fellow’s point of view. He will indeed be missed by his many friends, his associates, and by his classmates.\n\nSteve leaves his wife, Ruth Tracy Mil- lard, of 2069 E. Webster St., Merrick, N. Y., and a sister, Mrs. Helen M. Seale. To them the Class extends its deepest sympathy.\n\nChester Ambrose Scott Morton, a veteran newspaper man, died June 20 in Grand Central Hospital, New York City. Born June 19, 1903 in Delphos, Ohio, he started his long career in journalism soon after leaving Dartmouth where he was a Chi Phi. From his early days with the Bos- ton Transcript, the Toledo News Bee, and a brief hitch as editorial assistant with the Review of Reviews, he returned to his home state in 1933 as a reporter for the Toledo Times, and later became its music and drama critic. In 1945 Chester joined the staff of the New York Sun. In 1950 he be- came a member of the staff of the New York lournal-American when the Sun merged with the New York World Tele- gram. For the past twelve years he was a member of the lournal-American rewrite staff.\n\nA bachelor, he lived at the Dartmouth Club on 38 th Street for a few years in the early 40’s, later moving to an apartment in one of the old brownstones at 34 Beekman Place, where he lived at the time of his death. He was an avid reader. Chester was a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve during World War 11.\n\nChester is survived only by his twin brother, Charles E. Morton, of Blandford, Mass., who is also a member of the Class of ’26. Chester’s death was, indeed, un- timely. There should have been further years for a greater contribution to the news- paper work to which he devoted more than 35 years of his lifetime. Our sincere sympa- thies to his brother. Chuck Morton.\n\n1928\n\nWilliam Cogswell died suddenly June 24 of a cerebral hemorrhage at his home, 104-20 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, N. Y. He had not been ill and death came while he was asleep.\n\nHis family is the only one in Dartmouth history where for six consecutive generations a son of the family has gone to Dartmouth, starting with Nathaniel Cogswell, Class of 1794. Bill’s grandson is a candidate for ad- mission in the Class of 1976.\n\nBill, a direct descendant of Henry Clay, was born July 1, 1906 in Boston, Mass., and prepared for Dartmouth at Tabor Acad- emy. He left college after two years and worked for the Fifth Avenue Bank in New York until 1928, when he went with a stock exchange firm. He stayed in that business and at the time of his death was co-man- ager of the Radio City office of Fahnestock & Cos., with whom he had been for 21 years.\n\nHe was devoted to Dartmouth and at- tended all reunions. He started working for the Class in 1936 as an assistant Class Agent. In 1952 and 1954 he was Class Agent and in 1953 he and George Pasfield were Co- s of our 25th Reunion Memorial Fund.\n\nBill's third marriage took place in 1952 to Mrs. Greta Kittell of Winchester, Mass. He is survived by her, a son. Clay '52, of Birmingham, Mich,, two grandchildren, Sherry and Bradford William Cogswell, and four stepchildren. His stepson, David H. Kittell, was a member of the Class of 1957.\n\n1930\n\nHouston Coleman Boyles died sud- denly on May 22, 1962. He had collapsed at home, and passed away later in the day at Peekskill Hospital. Hugh was a native of Minneapolis and attended Dartmouth only in the middle two years of our course. For the following twenty years, little was heard from him, but shortly before our 25th re- union he regained an interest in Dartmouth and in the Class, which was particularly pleasing to his many classmates in the New York area. He had attended the spring din- ner of the group barely two weeks before he passed away, and had seemed in his usual good health and spirits.\n\nHugh had spent most of his business life in the merchandising and advertising fields, with the New York Daily News, Erwin Wasey & Company, Simplicity Pattern Com- pany, and the Magazine Advertising Bu- reau. He had a very distinguished record in World War 11, having been one of seven men who survived the annihilation of a battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division. He had earned the Purple Heart and three bat- tle stars. He also served as a combat corre- spondent and had written for Stars and Stripes under his own byline.\n\nHugh was a Phi Gam and a popular member of that house. He was a member of the Overseas Press Club and at one time a specialized consultant to the United Na- tions. He dabbled in art and some of his work had been exhibited locally.\n\nHugh is survived by his widow, Gretchen, and their son Robert, 15, both of whom ac- companied him to reunion in 1960. Their home is on Watch Hill Road, Peekskill, N. Y. We deeply regret the loss of a friendly classmate who had pleased so many by resuming his interest in Dartmouth af- fairs.\n\n1932\n\nRichard Woodman Allen died at age 52 in Quantico, Va., on August 28 while on a special training assignment with the Fed- eral Bureau of Investigation. A native of Brockton, Mass., Dick lived with his wife Jane and daughters Barbara and Patricia at 627 Main Street, Hingham, Mass. A third daughter, Miss Joan Allen, is living in nearby Boston.\n\nDick majored in French at Dartmouth and upon graduation pursued his studies at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Harvard Uni- versity where he earned a Master’s degree. Before joining the FBI he taught in high schools at Wilmington, Mass., and Farming- ton, Conn., and returned to Harvard on a teaching fellowship. It was early in this pe- riod of his life that he married Miss Jane Margaret Lawler in Brockton.\n\nIn 1942 he joined the FBI and remained with that organization up to the date of his untimely death. Assigned to the Boston of- fice, he traveled quite frequently to various cities in this country and in South America. Recently he had been assigned to the FBI field office in New York. A man of fine principles, he devoted as much time as he could to community affairs and to the in- terests of his family. He was interested in boating and was a member of the Hingham Yacht Club.\n\nJohn Donald Brett, M.D., died at St. Vincent Charity Hospital in Cleveland, 0., on July 20 at age 52 of a pulmonary em- bolism following an operation for cancer of the lung. In 1950 and 1951 he was chief of staff at Cleveland Woman’s Hospital and remained on the staff until his death. He also maintained a private practice. His home was at 2683 Rochester Road, Shaker Heights.\n\nJohnny was a native of Shaker Heights and went to high school there. At Dart- mouth he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi, Alpha Chi Sigma and Dragon. He received his M.D. from Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1936. In World War II he was stationed at the Army Air Corps rehabilitation center in Coral Gables, Fla., and was discharged after the war with the rank of major.\n\nHe was a man of many interests and his hobbies included boating, water-skiing, golf, and photography. He loved to spend his vacations with his family on a small lake in New York State. In addition to belonging to a number of medical organizations, he was a member of the Cleveland Skating Club and five Masonic groups.\n\nSurviving are his wife, the former Helen Watters whom he married in 1938, and two daughters, Judith and Constance. Also sur- viving is a sister, who is the wife of John Prentiss ’32 of Hudson.\n\n1936\n\nJohn Dunbar Creigh of 2117 Middle- fork Road, Nqrthfield, 111., died June 9 of arterial sclerosis, at St. Luke’s Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago. John remained active as vice president of Service Gas Products Cos. up until one month before his death. The company was founded by John and his brother right after World War 11. Head- quarters are in Tulsa, and John spent ten years in the gas fields of southwest Kansas and Oklahoma until his move six years ago to Northfield.\n\naE)yj - Following college John worked first for the American Airlines and then joined Pure Oil Cos., whom he left at the outbreak of World War II to enlist in the Naval Re- serve. He served five years on a destroyer in the Pacific, and on the staff of Commander North Pacific Force.\n\nClassmate Dr. Gordon Brown, of Win- netka, a dose friend through the years, de- scribes in the following words a great fight- ing spirit no Dartmouth man will ever forget. “John’s death concludes a seven-year struggle against the ‘bad arteries’ which he reported with such optimistic good humor in the biographical sketch he submitted for the 25th Reunion Book. With similar grace and magnificent courage, John met the re- current terrors which his illness and its treatment forced relentlessly upon him. These fine attributes and the warmth of his personality were movingly memorialized in the Morthfield Community Church on June 12.”\n\nJohn is survived by his mother, two brothers, a sister, his wife (Bev), two sons and a daughter, to whom the Class of 1936 extends its heartfelt sympathy.\n\nHis host of Dartmouth friends were grieved to learn of the untimely death of Robert Gay MacPherson in Boston’s Deaconess Hospital June 28. Bob, who lived at 309 Edgell Road in Framingham Center, Mass., had been-in the hospital for three weeks. Bob had received a heart-warm- ing message from most of his ’36 classmates a year ago when he was unable to attend the 25th Reunion because he was hospital- ized for a leg amputation. His Dartmouth friends will agree with the Rev. Daniel Fen- ner who spoke, at the funeral services, of Bob’s qualities of courage, service, gen- erosity, and tolerance.\n\nBob was a varsity hockey player at Dart- mouth, a member of Sphinx Senior Society and Sigma Chi fraternity.\n\nA former member publisher of the Ban- gor, Me., Daily Commercial, Bob had been treasurer and general manager of the Fram- ingham, Mass., Daily News for the past sixteen years. He was a trustee of the Fram- ingham Union Hospital; a director of the rramingham Trust Cos.; a member of the board of the Framingham Savings Bank; nrst vice president of the Bay State Society, Clin hlem*)er the ®race Congregational\n\nBob is survived by his wife, Deborah UNeaUey) MacPherson; two daughters, Mrs. Starnes °f Marblehead, Mass., and ; *1S '-’oborah Gay MacPherson of Fram- ngham; a son, Robert G. MacPherson Jr.; r°iber, James E. Jr. ’39, and a sister. Miss Janet MacPherson, all of Framingham; oy his mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. James E. MacPherson ’10; and one grand-\n\n~ Dartmouth classmates who were among i® r cr°wd that attended funeral serv- ant ii Bob included Ted Olsen, Joe Davis, and John McKernan.\n\n1937\n\nRichard Volney Chase Jr. died of a ( heart attack on August 26 while swimming I in Long Pond near Plymouth, Mass. He was 47 years old; death cut short a distinguished career as literary critic, biographer, and pro- j fessqr of English at Columbia University.\n\nDick Chase was born in Lakeport, N. H., October 12, 1914. Theta Delta Chi in col- lege, he received his A.B. degree from Dart- ! mouth in 1937, his M.A. from Columbia in 1939 and his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1946. | He resided at 259 Engle St. in Penally, N. J. He leaves his wife, Frances; four children, Richard, Elizabeth, Elliott and Nathaniel, and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Chase T1 of Osterville, Mass.\n\nTo classmates who remembered Dick as an English major and as editor-in-chief of Jack-o-Lantern, it came as no surprise when he moved on to a distinguished literary ca- reer. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1949 as an assistant professor of English and was promoted to full professor in 1958. Dick wrote extensively about American folklore and American literary figures. His best-known books were “The American Novel and Its Tradition,” “Walt Whitman Reconsidered,” “Herman Melville A Crit- ical Study” and “The Democratic Vista,” which he described as a “dialogue on life and letters of contemporary America.”\n\nTo his wife and children the Class ex- tends its deepest sympathy. Over and above these feelings of personal regret is the sense that society, too, has suffered a severe loss in the death, at a relatively early age, of a writer and scholar whose early works gave such promise for the future.\n\n1943\n\nCorydon Francis Taylor died in Rum- son, N. J., on July 29 after a long illness. Death was from cancer. Born in Madison, Wis., Corky attended Phillips Exeter and came to Dartmouth with A 1 Phillips, Tom McManus, Alex Nagle, and others from thal Exeter class. A member of Zeta Psi at Dart- mouth, Corky, like so many other class- mates, had his Dartmouth career interrupted by the war. He served three years in the Air Corps as a bomb sight specialist with extensive duty in the Aleutians, being dis- charged as a sergeant.\n\nAfter the war Corky worked for IBM, eventually turning to Wall Street where he fashioned his life’s work. At his death he was vice president. Financial Planning Corp., and partner in the securities underwriting firm of Godfrey, Hamilton and Taylor, Inc., both of New York. He was a member of the Rumson Country Club, Sea Bright Beach Club, and the Leash in New York.\n\nHis family surviving him are his widow, Brenda Lobdell Taylor, two sons, David S. 14, Curtis S. 10, and two daughters, Nancy L. 11 and Mimi 8.\n\nCorky was an enthusiastic Dartmouth man and attended many reunions. His Dart- mouth classmates and friends extend their most sincere sympathy to his family in their loss.\n\n1958\n\nRichard Spear Brooks, of 63 Ferris St., St. Albans, Vt., was killed instantly, early Friday, August 10, when the car he was driving left the highway and crashed side- ways into a large tree.\n\nAfter graduating from Bellows Free Acad- emy, he attended Dartmouth College prior to entering Tufts University and subse- quently the Tufts Dental School, where he was enrolled at the time of his death. He was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nHe leaves his mother, Mrs. Dorothy Spear Brooks, to whom the Class extends its most sincere sympathy.\n\n1961\n\nA fine young man and an outstanding member of the Class of 1961 has passed away. The news reached us some time ago of the death of Donald Robert Spurgeon.\n\nDon entered Dartmouth in September, 1957 and completed his freshman year be- fore transferring to Pomona College. He at- tended high school in Colorado Springs where he was a member of the National Honor Society, a member of the varsity baseball team and a starting halfback on the state championship football team. Don represented his high school at Boys’ State and was selected to represent Colorado at Boys’ Nation.\n\nWhile at Dartmouth Don played fresh- man football and basketball. He was a well- known and respected member of our Class and a friendly and courageous man. He died after a fourteen-month struggle against can- cer. The trustees and faculty of Pomona conferred Don’s degree posthumously the first time they had so done.\n\nDon is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Spurgeon, a brother, Allen of Menlo Park, Calif., and by his grandfather, Mr. J. Allen McEwen of Youngstown, Ohio- The Class of 1961 would like to express its deep regret.\n\nJohn Scrafford Mauk ’24"
