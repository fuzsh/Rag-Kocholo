        "meta_description": "BA Drama Majors Alumni News This attempt at gathering news from BA Drama alums started fairly small, but has grown to a listing of over 200 former students. For high school students looking at the major, and for the naturally curious as well, this round-up will shed light on the amazingly varied career paths (in the performing arts and out) that our alums in the BA Drama degree have discovered. For this round-up, I rely mostly on e-mails from former students. I don't always get to updating as often as I should, but I try to make some efforts at least once a semester. So if you're not in here and want to be, drop a line! And if you're not doing theatre, that's more than fine! By the way, since I got on to Facebook (thanks to alum BA Lawrence) I have found out about a lot more of my favorite former students! ASo a few years back alum Britney Smallwood and I started a facebook group: \"To Be or Not To Be a BA - What a Question!\" Check it out, and if you're a BA alum, join us!  -- Dr Jack - last update: 12 June 2011 First I want to list the activities of our just graduated BAs from the class of 2011, as a number have already made some interesting choices: Jess Askew (’11) will be a North American Culture and Language Assistant teaching English in a public school in the south of Spain, in Andalucia. The program is run by Spain's Ministerio de Educacion, so basically through the government! Tara Baron (’11) will be working for City Year, a group that unites young people of all backgrounds for a year of full-time service, giving them the skills and opportunities to change the world. As a tutor, mentor and role model, Tara will help children stay in school and on track! Kelsey Burston (’11) was chosen to be a directing intern at the Wolftrap Opera Company! Logan Ellis ’11 has accepted the Artistic Direction Apprenticeship at the prestigious Magic Theatre in San Francisco! Jasmine Francois (’11) has been accepted into the JET program, and will be an assistant teacher of English in Japan! Jenna Grossman (’11) will be a Teaching Artist this summer with Cal Shakes in Berkeley California, teaching acting and Shakespeare and assisting in workshops and rehearsals at the their Conservatory for teens. She’ll also take classes on the business of being a teaching artist. Next, from late August 2011 to July 2012, she will be the Education/ Theatre for Kids intern with Portland Stage in Maine, developing and implementing programming for that program, teaching, writing study guides, working in the office and crewing for their mainstage shows. Stephanie Jayko (’11) will be working for Opera Saratoga this summer as an ASM on Cosi Fan Tutte. Then she moves to Santa Maria, CA to work at PCPA as an ASM/Intern for their next season (from August 2011 to May 2012).

It’s her third summer working at the Hangar. Then from September through December, she will be an SM intern and educational tour manager at Asolo Rep in Florida. Immediately after that, she will be a member of the stage staff on a Royal Caribbean cruise! Emily Viterise (’11) will be working with the Summer Sun program at the Strong National Museum of Play, in Rochester NY! And now to the rest! Whitney Adams (‘03) formed a company called DAVAI, where she has produced several productions with fellow alums Christina Pickard (‘03) and Logan Tracey (‘03).  One of their efforts was Going Home, written by Christina and featuring Whitney, at the Tank Theatre in New York City. Whitney was also featured in Julianne Caesar at Teatro La Tea in New York City. In August 2004 Whitney was featured in The Slant Theatre Project's  NUEVA CANCION, a tapestry of highly charged vignettes exploring the political and social climate of Chile in the 1970's, at The Phil Bosakowski Theater in NYC. In 2006 Whitney was back at Slant Theatre Projects’ Couchworks where she appeared as the \"Trumpet Expert\" in Mat Smart's piece, Music for High Ceilings. Whitney made the big move to LA ‘a bit on a whim’ in November 2006 and has found it a better fit for her than NYC. She is taking class, doing casting workshops, trying to get her ‘proverbial foot in the door.’ She is also exploring one of her other passions....food and all that encompasses.  She is working at Cut in Beverly Hills and geting to know a lot of people in the restaurant business! Zia Anger ('08) After moving to LA in September Zia very promptly decided to move back East \"to make some art with her friends.\" Oh, also, her senior thesis film \"Lover Boy\" won Grand Prize at the Rhode Island International Film Festival this summer (Brava Zia!) and is slowly making the rounds on the festival circuit. Those interested can check out the life of the film at http://loverboythefilm.blogspot.com.   In Spring 2009 Zia is directing the spring musical at Boynton Middle School in Ithaca! In early June, she received a 2009 National Board of Review Student grant for her film Lover Boy! Zia begins her MFA in film at the prestigious Chicago Art Institute in Fall 2010!

He recently produced and directed the world premiere reading of the musical he co-wrote with fellow alum Tony Mayes, UBU: A Patamusical, at the New York Musical Theatre Festival. His feature screenplay, Doing Paris, was recently placed in the Top Ten as part of Coppola's American Zoetrope contest. He is currently working on a feature script, a stage play, an opera libretto, and shooting many short films with Brian Maillard, with whom he has formed Tall & Skinny Films. He and Brian were guest artists here at the very beginning of the Fall 2009 semester, doing workshops on commercials and inspiring BAs! Meryl Ballew (’08) was the ASM for the Aspen Music Festival in Aspen, CO, in summer 2008, a job she got through David Lefkowich. The wise young Meryl comments that this “just goes to prove what I always believed, it pays to make friends.” She contacted me in late June to say that she was working on La Cenerentola and was loving the festival and the beautiful countryside! As of spring 2009 she is working at Juilliard! Allison Barber (‘04), after working and backpacking in Scotland, and living in London, is now specializing as a Celtic singer, and one with a really beautiful voice! Allison celebrated the release of her debut album, Traveling Home, at Ulysses in downtown Manhattan on 12 May 2007. I have my own copy of the CD, so I know you can all purchase it now, and I highly recommend it! Allison tells me she has a second cd on the way, due in 2009. Matt Barber (’95) is living in Buffalo, working day jobs to pay the bills, but doing what he loves by night – drumming in bands! Emoke Bebiak ('10) is in graduate school in journalism at the distinguished Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, MO! Beth Beecher (Winsor) (’92) is teaching kindergarten at Hendy Avenue Elementary School in Elmira NY and as she says is ‘loving it.’ She has two boys, aged 6 and 4.   Cecelia Behar-Bush ('95), after appearing in several plays and TV shows in NYC (including: All My Children, As the World Turns, Ed, & Will and Grace), decided that she wanted to try something new (and wanted to be able to eat solid foods & carbs again) and applied to Hunter College Grad School. She completed her degree in Counseling, with a specialty in School Counseling. As of January 2005 she became a licensed therapist. Cecelia was also the co-director of the NYC cat rescue group \"NYC Siamese Rescue\". Cecelia is happily married to fellow Ithaca College Graduate Jesse Bush (also '95, but a BFA...no relation to George). The two of them used to live in Washington Heights with their two, you guessed it, Siamese cats. In Fall 2005 they moved to Ithaca and Cecelia became a new mom in Fall 2006 – she and Jesse produced a beautiful baby named Harper June! Andrew Bodd (‘02), after working in a number of tech theatre jobs, was accepted for a Master’s Program at the prestigious North Carolina School of the Arts! He began in Fall 2008. Jay Bogdanowitsch (’95) is living and working in Los Angeles, specifically at Santa Monica College’s Work Force Development Center. Jay shoots, edits, and produces in-house videos for the school. He is acting as well. A member of SAG, he has a commercials agent and is a member of a theatre company called Sacred Fools Theatre. He has also kept up with writing and filmmaking by writing, directing, and producing his own 35mm short film that screened at over 34 international and national film festivals and garnered 4 awards! About his personal life, Jay says, “I have been dating, but still not ‘the’ perfect girl but ‘a’ perfect girl still eludes me.” Pete Boisvert (’99) founded Nosedive Productions five years ago and it’s still going strong.     For Nosedive's 5th anniversary season, Pete produced two full length plays:For Nosedive's 5th anniversary season, Pete is producing two full length plays:The Dying Goldfish, about the effects of a stroke on an English professor and the way in which it effects his very literary extended family when they gather for his daughter's wedding, and McTeague, adapted from the turn of the century Frank Norris novel, about a dentist driven to madness by his miserly wife. A Very Nosedive Christmas Carol opened in December 2004 at UNDER St. Marks. This new, loose adaptation of Dicken's story is told from the perspective of Marley and the Ghosts, who are actors trapped in a neverending cycle -- they must perform for Scrooge every Christmas to open his eyes yet again!  A number of other alumni were involved in this (as in all) Nosedive Production: Patrick Shearer (’99) played Scrooge (and is involved in the artistic direction of the company); alum Melanie Adelman played a number of smaller roles, including the Cratchit's daughter Martha. Ali Golden and Chris Daly designed sets and lights respectively and Maggie Coleman (‘03) helped out on the production/management end.   In June 2006 their play The Adventures of Nervous Boy (A Penny Dreadful) opened at the Gene Frankel Underground, and as of spring 2011 Nosedive is still going strong! Nick Bombicino (’10) is directing at the New England Youth Theatre, where he teaches an intensive course there called \"Shakespeare's Greatest Scenes.\" At NEYT Nick has also directed many two-week programs -- for kids from ages 9 to 14. Janine Brancale (‘93) jumped right into the New York Theatre scene when she left Ithaca College, which she credits for preparing her very well. She quickly got into costuming and ultimately became a star dresser, for among others Audra McDonald in Ragtime! As fascinating as this was, she tired of the scene and is living in Connecticut. When I caught up with Janine at Mahogany Grill in summer 2008, she told me that she is now looking to become a nutritionist, or maybe to open her own healthy foods shop or café! Kiera Brown (’03) has been a full time mom since August 2008, living in Amsterdam NY. She worked a series of ‘horrifying’ jobs after graduation with a great trip to Ireland stuck in between.  One of the jobs was at the ‘wretched’ Ticketmaster, but there was a bonus -- as a top agent she was sent to see Broadway shows for free. She’s thinking of having one of her plays published. She has also casually started to write and illustrate a few children's books, but  most of her time is playing mommy and being an impromptu secretary for her boyfriend's remodeling company.  My favorite quote from Kiera’s note to me: “People often tell me I made a huge mistake in what I chose to study.  I disagree, for how can you ever make a mistake in studying character, emotion and the extremes of the human condition?” Joe Brucie (‘94) is assistant principal at Hendy Avenue Elementary School, in Elmira NY. Jillian Buck ('05) early in 2007 ended a three year run with Carnival Cruise Lines, sailing all over the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and along the Mexican Riviera. She was promoted to Senior Entertainment Tech while there, specializing in automation tech, dealing with cutting edge equipment! This world traveler (Cannes, Dubrovnik, Capri and Florence among a few recent visits) also lived in Toronto and is now out in Colorado -- where to next?!

Kerry Campbell (‘01) studied law at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento, CA, where she made Law Review, and put her acting training to use as a finalist in the first-year Mock Trial competition. She attended Oral Argument at the Supreme Court and met with Justice Kennedy to talk about The Law. Kerry had planned to go to Austria in summer 2005 to study international law with Justice Kennedy, but in making Law Review she was forced to stay in Sacramento, writing reviews of upcoming California legislation. Kerry has graduated from law school and passed the bars in CA and NV.  She works as a law clerk for a justice on the Nevada Supreme Court and will go onto to clerk for a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in August.  Kerry is also looking at law firms in San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles, but may stay in Northern Nevada, about which she says, “I love the mountains and the weather, but could use fewer cowboys and conservatives.” Ian Carnathan ('95) has for the last several years been trading bonds for a pension fund manager - as he says, \"It's a pretty good gig!\" He spent a vacation at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival, and tells me he really wants to return.

Kate Chell Milford (’98) has, as of summer 2008, been married for a year and a half, has two small dogs, and is living in Brooklyn. She is also till writing. Her agent is showing a young adult book of mine around the publishing world, and she is also working on a website for an invented city (Nagspeake) and a short-story collection set there, and a feature screenplay that, as Kate says, “is taking way too long.” Rosie Chevalier ('08) spent summer '09 at the Actors Theatre of Louiville as a literary intern, and interned at Second City in fall 09!  Danny Clemens (‘09) is working on his Master’s Degree in Education at UNC Chapel Hill! This summer he wrote: “I have become somewhat known as the \"theatre guy\" in my program here at UNC. I also thought it would make you happy to know that many of the instructors here are encouraging me to pursue teaching theatre as well. Apparently there are a lot of incentives in North Carolina to become a theatre teacher and, let's face it, it will probably be a lot more fun that social studies...” Go, Danny! Ashley Clements ('07) was accepted at her two top choices for grad school -- ART/Harvard Advanced Institute and UC San Diego/Old Globe -- and chose the latter! She began in fall 2007, and at the very beginning of her term she auditioned for a mainstage show at the prestigious Old Globe -- and got a role! Ashley played Kat, the 16 year old runaway, in a production of Howard Korder's Sea of Tranquility, directed by Michael Bloom. It ran at the Old Globe in January and February 2008.

Jay is artistic apprentice at Hartford Stage for the 2008-09 season!  Jessica Cohen (’99) has, as of summer 2008, finished her fourth year teaching English at Riverhead High School while singing in a cover band and performing in local theatre.

Her title is now Associate Director of Institutional Giving! Jennifer Crabb (Egner) (‘94) worked for a small theatre company during the world famous Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

She worked for the Seattle Times as a media specialist for a few years, and now lives in Everett, WA, about 25 miles north of Seattle. She is married with a dog and a cat and works, as she says, “in marketing, which I love. Perfect blend of creative and the persuasive arts.” In November 2007 she began work for a library system, which in her words again, “is fantastic. I get paid to promote library usage!” Alexandra Creighton (’02) has been actively working on new play development (as an actor & co-collaborator) in the San Francisco Bay Area, as a company member of San-Francisco-based Crowded Fire Theatre Company (www.crowdedfire.org).

She just closed in two strong plays that were running in rep together in Midtown Atlanta which got some great reviews. Mandy, cleverly, has allied herself with an intelligent young, local playwright and as she says “I've tricked him into writing all sorts of great parts for me.” She does paralegal work during the day at a lawfirm with the amusing name of Slappey & Sadd. In her own words Mandy says, “how could I not work here?” Andre Cuda ('02) is working on his MSW in Maine.

Eileen Duffy (’93) worked as a casting director for Harriet Bass Casting (formerly Bass-Vsigilio). Her latest major effort was August Wilson’s Gem of the Ocean, seeing it through two years of regional productions to its Broadway run in Fall 2004. For a time, Eileen traded the world of theatrical casting for casting executives, same principle, but much more lucrative! But the lure of the theatre brought her back into casting as an associate at Harriet Bass in 2006.  As she says, “I am casting away here in NYC!\" She is regularly a part of one of our best panels at Field Studies, the casting panel, and in April 2009 she is coming to Ithaca as a guest artist to talk to students about the world of casting.

Demetra Markis (’98) wrote me such a wonderful note that I am merely going to reproduce it here, as I could not say it nearly so well: “I have meandered far from the traditional theatre path and found myself navigating the personal dramas of traditional Chinese medical practice, at which I am much more suited (though music remains my avocation and the focus of much of my free time). However, my theatre background has proved versatile enough to be something I regularly draw upon in my interactions with patients and in experiencing my life in general; I feel very lucky that I had that time through college to focus on the many aspects of human relationships. Theatre history remains one of my favorite subjects and I credit it with helping me realize that my desire to effect positive change in society (as theatre has so often done) would be best served on a more individual basis, as I've discovered in medicine. I live in San Francisco with my restauranteur husband and our lovely four-year-old daughter Lily.” Jessica Martenson (’01) attended the Drama Studio London immediately after graduating, and as soon as she finished there she was cast in a five month English-language tour of Italy in a children’s play, Aladdin, geared to teach young Italian students English.  She then went almost immediately into rehearsals for a play based on Steven King’s Misery, performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in summer 2004.

        "text": "BA Drama Majors Alumni News\n\nThis attempt at gathering news from BA Drama alums started fairly small, but has grown to a listing of over 200 former students. For high school students looking at the major, and for the naturally curious as well, this round-up will shed light on the amazingly varied career paths (in the performing arts and out) that our alums in the BA Drama degree have discovered.\n\nFor this round-up, I rely mostly on e-mails from former students.

And if you're not doing theatre, that's more than fine!\n\nBy the way, since I got on to Facebook (thanks to alum BA Lawrence) I have found out about a lot more of my favorite former students!

She has also casually started to write and illustrate a few children's books, but most of her time is playing mommy and being an impromptu secretary for her boyfriend's remodeling company. My favorite quote from Kiera’s note to me: “People often tell me I made a huge mistake in what I chose to study.

However, my theatre background has proved versatile enough to be something I regularly draw upon in my interactions with patients and in experiencing my life in general; I feel very lucky that I had that time through college to focus on the many aspects of human relationships. Theatre history remains one of my favorite subjects and I credit it with helping me realize that my desire to effect positive change in society (as theatre has so often done) would be best served on a more individual basis, as I've discovered in medicine. I live in San Francisco with my restauranteur husband and our lovely four-year-old daughter Lily.”\n\nJessica Martenson (’01) attended the Drama Studio London immediately after graduating, and as soon as she finished there she was cast in a five month English-language tour of Italy in a children’s play, Aladdin, geared to teach young Italian students English.
