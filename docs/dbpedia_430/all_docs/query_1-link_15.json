        "text": "This is a list of notable alumni from the University of Cambridge, featuring members of the University of Cambridge segregated in accordance with their fields of achievement. The individual must have either studied at the university (although they may not necessarily have taken a degree), or worked at the university in an academic capacity; others have held fellowships at one of the university's colleges. Honorary fellows or those awarded an honorary degree are not included and neither are non-executive chancellors. Lecturers without long-term posts at the university also do not feature, although official visiting fellows and visiting professors do.\n\nThe list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Many of the university's alumni/ae have attained a level of distinction in more than one field. These individuals may appear under two categories. In general, however, an attempt has been made to put individuals in the category with which they are most associated.\n\nCantabrigians is a term for members of the university derived from its Latin name Cantabrigia, a medieval Latin name for Cambridge.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru (Trinity), first Prime Minister of India\n\nDr Manmohan Singh (St John's College), Prime Minister of India\n\nOliver Cromwell (Sidney Sussex), first Lord Protector\n\nLee Kuan Yew (Fitzwilliam), Prime Minister of Singapore 1959-1990\n\nLee Hsien Loong (Trinity), Prime Minister of Singapore 2004-2024\n\nDudley Senanayake (Corpus Christi), Prime Minister of Ceylon 1952-1952, 1960, 1965-1970\n\nJohn Kotelawala (Christ's), Prime Minister of Ceylon 1953-1956\n\nAnand Panyarachun (Trinity), Prime Minister of Thailand 1991-1992, 1992\n\nKnown:\n\nSuspected:\n\nVictor Rothschild (Trinity)\n\n(for other suspects, see Cambridge Five)\n\n* Not part of official Cambridge Nobel count.\n\nZoe Cunningham, 2010 Ladies World Backgammon Champion and business executive\n\nSandra Landy (1938-2017), international player for England and for Great Britain; world champion 1981\n\nTom Townsend, Britain and England international and writer\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Automobile Club\n\nOliver Turvey (Fitzwilliam), GP2 driver (2010â€“)\n\nJohn Gosden (Emmanuel)"
