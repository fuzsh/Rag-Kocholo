        "text": "Kevin McConnell was selected as the 2022 recipient of the Bill Rose Memorial Award for his exceptional contributions to the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA). With nearly 40 years of experience as a licensed plumber, Kevin brought extensive knowledge and leadership to the Mechanical Maintenance shop of Facilities & Campus Services. His dedication was evident in his proactive approach to maintaining campus infrastructure, including critical projects like boiler replacements and seasonal maintenance tasks. Kevin's reliability and expertise made him the go-to person for complex mechanical issues, and he played a crucial role in mentoring new staff members, ensuring smooth operations within his team.\n\nKevin's commitment extended beyond technical proficiency; he fostered collaboration between departments, particularly with Student Housing, where he was known for his responsiveness and problem-solving skills during emergencies. His dedication to student welfare and campus well-being transformed interdepartmental relationships, emphasizing cooperation and mutual support. Kevin's unwavering dedication, professionalism, and humor in challenging situations embodied the qualities recognized by the Bill Rose Award, making him a deserving recipient for his integral role in advancing UAA's mission and community.\n\nRebecca Jackson\n\nCAS/COEng Team Lead\n\nShared Services\n\nRebecca manages various roles and tasks, and does so with sound reasoning, compassion, and transparency. During the transition to Shared Services her positive leadership has ensured the highest level of service to all teams she works with while keeping teams grounded.\n\nRebecca exhibits an extraordinary level of professionalism and customer services. And, is a helpful and accurate budget information resource.\n\nRebecca always finds a way to keep moral up and her commitment is unwavering.\n\nKara Monroe\n\nGrounds Supervisor\n\nFacilities and Campus Services\n\nKara oversees a wide range of campus needs and programs, and does so with passion, enthusiasm, attentiveness, and innovation. In addition to ensuring that UAA maintains cherished recognitions, Kara collaborates with community partners and seeks external funding assistance.\n\nAmong these needs is community engagement. During COVID Kara filmed a virtual Tree Tour of west campus which provided a ways for elementary school students to participate.\n\nKara is a patient mentor and role model whose dedication is unending.\n\nJoe Kelley\n\nDesktop Lead Technician\n\nInformation Technology Services\n\nJoe was the lead on several projects this year. A few of those projects are the Windows 7 upgrade for west campus, dental clinic software upgrade, Eagle River campus closure; technology relocation, KRUA data recovery, digital signage transition to IT.\n\nHe overcame many issues and challenges to complete these projects on time, often-working long hours. He never hesitates to offer assistance on any project to complete the mission of the University and to enable faculty, staff and students succeed.\n\nPatrick Wilcox\n\nFleet Services Mechanic\n\nFacilities and Campus Services\n\nPatrick has served in multiple roles providing needed stability and dependability during many changes. A couple of those roles are shop lead and acting supervisor, while keeping up with his regular duties. His roles continue to expand, into emergency spill response and other areas while he upkeep's an average of 1400 work orders annually. And is always looking for ways to increase efficiency.\n\nHe is always willing to step in and step up when needed, often at a moment notice. Always providing excellent customer service.\n\nSara is a long-time employee of the university, and has transitioned to the Budget Office. In her new role, Sara has taken on new responsibilities with great confidence and is relied upon for accurate process and procedure information by not only the UAA community, but also those at SW who rely upon her role for action and feedback.\n\nWhen Sara left her previous position as Accounts Payable Manager, she continued to provide advice and guidance. When the new manager went out on FML for several months, Sara used her expertise in very complex accounting questions to support the department moving forward. And, continued to perform in her new role at a high level.\n\nSara works as a team member which is so valuable to creating a positive environment at UAA. After getting comfortable with her new role, she saw that an employee who works in the same area, but not part of the budget office, had no back up if they were out sick or on vacation. So, Sara took it upon herself to cross-train on how to process the “bank” each day so she could provide coverage there.\n\nAnd, it goes without saying that Sara is always a positive, helpful, and accurate resource to others on Budget issues.\n\nRyan adapts behind the scenes in Facilities as needed for various titles and duties always seeking and striving for excellence in his assignments. He exhibits excellence in lean thinking, strategy development, communications to customers, sustainability, safety culture and process improvement. Ryan has assumed multiple roles and duties to fill in the gaps. These roles have a reaching affect across the campus units, across to the community campuses, across to our municipal partners, community partners, stakeholders and customers, and all in service to UAA and its mission.\n\nRyan is willing to jump in where needed to keep projects moving ahead and has a deep sense of commitment to process improvement. He has overseen the installation of bike storage lockers, bike workstations, water bottle filling stations, reduction of electricity and paper use, redefining space use during capital improvements, and investment in campus fixtures and hardware for increased cost savings over the long-term."
