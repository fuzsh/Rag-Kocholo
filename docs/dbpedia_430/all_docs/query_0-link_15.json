These drawings became an important resource for professional makers worldwide but have not been readily available for several years. Now the Lute Society is delighted that Stephen has agreed to offer them for sale again. The drawings have differing levels of detail and several of the drawings show two lutes on one sheet. A summary of the contents of each drawing is shown next to its title. In addition many of the drawings come with a PDF of Stephenâs related measurement sheet which will be sent as an email attachment as part of your order together with a larger version of the little inset photos of the original instruments. These are very variable in quality and size but might be of interest.\n\nWorking Drawings for Makers\n\nRose drawings and Restoration reports\n\nLute Society Booklets\n\nBooks and Recordings\n\ntis the season to be merry\n\nChristmas Carols for Lute\n\nChristmas Carols"
