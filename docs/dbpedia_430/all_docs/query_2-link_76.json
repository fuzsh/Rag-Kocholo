        "text": "Pour out a glass of wine for the final Florida contestant on season 21 of \"The Bachelorette\", who was left without a rose on last night's episode.\n\nStill docked in New Zealand, this week's episode gave Bachelor Nation everything — heartwarming dates for Floridian lead Jenn Tran, heartbreaking eliminations and extra doses of classic reality TV show drama (yes, Sam M. and Devin are still beefing).\n\nIt was only a month ago that 25 men declared they were out for Jenn's heart and hand in marriage on the premiere episode. Now, ABC's hit reality show has dwindled down to just seven suitors after the fifth episode.\n\nHere's what you missed on the fifth episode of \"The Bachelorette\" last night, how many men are left and who went home.\n\nWho went home on 'The Bachelorette' week 5?\n\nEpisode five was a bloodbath for eliminations, with two rose ceremonies in the two-hour long episode. Here are the three men Jenn sent home, including the final Florida contestant:\n\nDylan, 24, a medical student from Elk Grove, California\n\nJohn, 25, a medical student from Delray Beach, Florida\n\nThomas N., 31, a retirement advisor from Tucker, Georgia\n\nThere was also a self-elimination during the episode — Austin, a 28-year old sales executive from San Diego, California. And if it counts, Jenn chose to not allow her ex-boyfriend Matt Rossi to join the competition.\n\nWhat happened on the last episode of 'The Bachelorette?' Who got a one-on-one date?\n\nLast night’s episode of “The Bachelorette” kicked off with a dramatic rose ceremony. Last week, the episode ended on a cliffhanger. Jenn’s ex-boyfriend, Matt, paid his own way to fly to New Zealand and ask to join the show.\n\nAnd while Jenn said that she and Matt had a great connection, she declined his request to join the other men and he went home.\n\n“Matt told me today that he is in love with me and that’s not something I’ve ever heard before,” Jenn told the remaining men. “Hearing it from him, it was all the right things, but said by the wrong guy. Looking around this room, I know that the right guy is in here… My future is in this room. My husband is in this room.”\n\nAfter Jenn’s ex left, the rose ceremony proceeded as usual and Jenn sent three men home, including the last Florida man that was left on the show, John from Delray Beach.\n\nThe first one-on-one date of the episode went to Jonathan, who got to jump into a helicopter with Jenn to find a birds-eye-view of Auckland. In classic “Bachelor” fashion, the helicopter landed next to a vineyard (during golden hour) and the two shared a picture-perfect date that looked like footage straight from a Hallmark film.\n\nJonathan and Jenn both did cartwheels, played hide-and-seek among the grapevines and shared a sunset soak in a hot tub overlooking the vineyard. On their dinner date, much like the other men who have gone before him this season, Jonathan told Jenn about a relationship that hurt him and changed his perspective on love.\n\nWhen Jenn gave him his rose and kiss, rain started falling – and just like that scene in “The Notebook,” the passion continued in the downpour. The producers couldn’t have planned a more perfect ending.\n\nThe group date was much less romantic. Jenn took seven of the men to a farm, to cut dingleberries from sheep butts and help with farm chores. The “best farmer of the day” title went to Devin, who got to spend extra time with Jenn because of it.\n\nSome of the men were annoyed with Devin (yet again) for winning the extra time with Jenn. They said he wasn’t incredibly involved with the activities on the date and focused too much on stealing time with Jenn instead.\n\n“Me and all the guys, we’re shoveling sh**, and we look up and see that Devin stole our girlfriend,” Sam M. told the camera. “I’ve learned not to be surprised. I think it shows a huge sign of disrespect and I don ‘t think that’s a quality Jenn is really looking for … But I really don’t care. Lions don’t concern themselves with the opinions of sheep.”\n\nThe cocktail party following the date was a little more somber than their time on the farm. Austin sent himself home, saying he didn’t feel like he had the same connection with Jenn that the other men had because they’ve spent less time together.\n\nHis leaving caused Jenn to question if she was good enough for the remaining men and they all took turns re-assuring her that they are all there for her – “good, bad and the ugly,” as Sam M. put it.\n\nThe second one-on-one date went to Grant. He and Jenn rode horses along the beach and also got romantically caught in the rain. During their post-horseback ride picnic, they had to open an umbrella to stay (somewhat dry) as they kissed in front of a massive rainbow over the beach.\n\nOn their diner date, Grant opened up to Jenn about his father being an addict and how that affected him growing up. She opened up to him about experiencing racism and gaslighting in one of her past relationships.\n\n“For Grant and I to be having such an emotional conversation and to be talking about really heavy topics, For Grant to understand where I’m coming from – it feels like a true partnership here,” Jenn told the camera.\n\nThe episode ended how it started: with a rose ceremony. This time, Dylan went home.\n\n'Jonathan's trauma dump' See Bachelor Nation reactions to last night's drama:\n\nWho is left on 'The Bachelorette' after night four?\n\nThere are officially less than 10 men left!\n\nHere are the seven men still standing after the season's fifth episode:\n\nDevin, 28, a freight company owner from Houston, Texas\n\nGrant, 30, a day trader from Houston, Texas\n\nJeremy, 29, a real estate investor from New York, New York\n\nJonathon, 27, a creative director from Los Angeles, California\n\nMarcus, 31, an Army Ranger veteran from Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nSam M., 27, a contractor from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\n\nSpencer, 30, a pet portrait entrepreneur from Dallas, Texas\n\nWhen are hometown dates for 'The Bachelorette'?\n\nWe are almost to the point of the season where the lead travels across the country to visit the families of the final four contestants.\n\nDubbed the \"hometown dates,\" these episodes have become iconic for being equally heartwarming and messy. Think of the scale being former lead Charity Lawson meeting soon-to-be fiancé Dotun Olubeko's family as his parents surprised him to \"Pilot Pete\" Weber not even meeting contestant Victoria Fuller's family due to arguing outside her house.\n\nJenn's hometown dates are set to come out on episode seven, which will air on Monday, Aug. 19.\n\nWhat time does 'The Bachelorette' come on every week?\n\n\"The Bachelorette\" season 21 comes on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT every Monday.\n\nHow do I stream 'The Bachelorette'?\n\nEpisodes of \"The Bachelorette\" season 21 with Jenn Tran stream on Hulu every Tuesday.\n\nWhen can I watch 'The Golden Bachelorette'?\n\nABC announced earlier this year they would embark on \"The Golden Bachelorette\" with fan-favorite from Gerry Turner's season — Joan Vassos, a 61-year-old private-school administrator from Maryland.\n\n\"The Golden Bachelorette\" will premiere this fall, slotted for Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT. ABC has not yet released an exact date.\n\nEpisodes have a 90-minute timeslot, 30 minutes longer than the first season of the \"The Golden Bachelor.\""
