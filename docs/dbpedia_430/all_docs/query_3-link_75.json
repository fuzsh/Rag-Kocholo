        "text": "Lela Rose, the New York City-based, American fashion designer widely regarded for her elegant aesthetic and fresh point of view, continues to redefine a sophisticated, yet modern lifestyle with her expanded, designer ready-to-wear-offering. Formally trained as a painter and sculptor prior to pursuing fashion design, Rose employs a brilliant use of color, rich fabrications, sculptural silhouettes and handcrafted details. Her artistic background is evident in her work and adds unexpected dimension and breadth to each season’s collection.\n\nToday, her eponymous collection spans a complete range of modern designer separates for day to occasion – including dresses, coats, jackets, tops, skirts, pants and knits, as well as clutches and jewelry – exuding casual luxury and refinement. In addition to the ready-to-wear offering, the Lela Rose bridal collection is an exquisitely designed offering of bridal gowns in sculptural silhouettes and luxe, flattering fabrications, and complementary accessories.\n\nRose’s unique point of view and the quality of her designs and fabrications have elevated the esteem of the brand, receiving recognition from fashion editors, stylists, and high-profile celebrities who are regularly seen wearing the brand – including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Chastain, Claire Danes, Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez, Zoe Saldana, Uma Thurman, Jessica Alba, Selma Blair, Laura Dern, Olivia Munn, Sofia Vergara, Karolina Kurkova, Chrissy Teigen, January Jones, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and First Lady Michelle Obama, among others.\n\nThe spirit of the brand and company is driven by the entrepreneurial designer and her passion for style, design and décor, which infuse all that emanates from the studio. Rose, now a published author, released her first book, Prêt-à-Party, with Rizzoli in 2015, which focused on her love of style and entertaining while creating a new platform for future opportunities and products.\n\nAs a principled, female business owner, wife and mother, Rose is committed to supporting and giving back to the community. Since the inception of the company over 20 years ago, Lela Rose has proactively supported a proven network of artisans, sewers, pattern-makers, manufacturers, and small business owners in New York City, maintaining all possible apparel production locally of her ready-to-wear and dress collections.\n\nThe Lela Rose ready-to-wear and bridal collections are sold nationwide in specialty stores; bridal boutiques; and premium retailers including Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, and Nordstrom; as well as the Lela Rose flagship boutique in Dallas, Texas. The brand is also sold internationally through specialty stores in Canada, the United Kingdom, Korea, Japan, and the Middle East; as well as online at lelarose.com.\n\nIn 2018, Rose launched Pearl by Lela Rose, a ready-to-wear clothing line that is fun, fabulous & effortlessly stylish. The collection is sold on the Pearl direct-to-consumer website as well as by a network of 80+ independent Pearl Stylists. Lela Rose, Lela Rose Bridal, and Pearl by Lela Rose share offices in New York City’s Garment District.\n\n- - - - -"
