        "text": "Marcus Johnson is in his second season as offensive line coach, joining Ryan Walters’ staff in March 2023 after spending three seasons at Missouri, including two as assistant head coach and run game coordinator.\n\nWalters and Johnson previously crossed paths at Missouri during the 2020 campaign when Walters was defensive coordinator and Johnson served as offensive line coach for the Tigers.\n\nJohnson has eight years of experience as an offensive line coach with previous stops at Duke (2016-17), Mississippi State (2018-19) and Missouri (2020-22).\n\nDespite multiple injuries to the offensive line throughout the 2023 season, Johnson made sure his guys were ready to go when called upon. Johnson’s group paved the way for the Boilermakers to lead the Big Ten in rushing in conference games (184.6 ypg). The Purdue offense rushed for 2,029 yards, the most since 2012, which included back-to-back 300-yard rushing games for the first time since 1968. Purdue’s 353 yards on the ground against Minnesota were the most by any Big Ten team in a conference game throughout the 2023 season. Under Johnson’s tutelage, a pair of Boilermakers earned All-Big Ten Honorable Mention (Gus Hartwig, Marcus Mbow).\n\nIn 2022, Mizzou’s offense rushed for 158.7 yards per game and 19 touchdowns. Through the air, the Tigers averaged 212.3 yards per game with 13 scores. For the first time since 2018, the ground game featured three 400-yard rushers (Cody Schrader with 692 yards, Brady Cook with 547 yards, Nathaniel Peat with 400 yards).\n\nThe 2021 season saw Tyler Badie set a new school record for single-season rushing yards (1,604). His 14 touchdowns in 12 games are good for ninth on Missouri's single season and Top 10 list. He was a CoSIDA Academic All-American, the Southeastern Conference Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year (Mizzou’s first-ever), First Team All-SEC and was named to multiple All-America teams. Badie was drafted 196th overall in the 2022 NFL Draft to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nIn 2020, Mizzou's offense rushed for 135.2 yards per game and 21 touchdowns. In the air, the Tigers averaged 266.8 yards per game with nine scores. The offensive line unit ranked fourth in the Southeastern Conference (behind Texas A&M, Alabama and Kentucky) and 30th nationally in sacks per game with 1.60.\n\nRunning back Larry Rountree III ended the season ranked fourth among active FBS rushers with 972 yards and 15 scores. Senior right tackle Larry Borom started eight games for the Tigers in 2020 and was a fifth-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. He became Mizzou's first offensive lineman drafted since 2016.\n\nJohnson arrived in Columbia after spending four seasons coaching the offensive lines at Mississippi State (2018-19) and Duke (2016-17).\n\nDuring his time in Starkville, the Bulldogs won 14 games overall, and played in the 2018 Outback Bowl and the 2019 Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl. His offensive line paved the way for First Team All-SEC running back Kylin Hill to rank second in the league and 16th nationally with 1,350 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, while the Bulldogs' rushing attack ranked third in the SEC and 21st nationally, averaging 220.6 yards per game in 2019.\n\nJohnson's first season at MSU was also a successful one as his line helped the offense rank second in the SEC in both rushing yards per game (223.6) and yards per rush (5.7). Anchored by center Elgton Jenkins, the 44th overall pick by Green Bay in the 2019 NFL Draft, the offensive line helped MSU rush for 300-or-more yards in an SEC-best four games. Jenkins earned First Team All-America honors from The Athletic and fourth team honors from Phil Steele.\n\nAlso under Johnson's guidance, Deion Calhoun had a standout senior season in 2018, earning Second Team All-SEC honors from the league's coaches. Calhoun allowed only two sacks over 356 pass-blocking snaps, according to PFF, and signed with Miami as an undrafted free agent.\n\nJohnson began his coaching career at Duke for his college coach David Cutcliffe, serving various roles over a seven-year period (2011-17) that saw the Blue Devils make five bowl appearances. Duke had not appeared in a bowl game since 1995.\n\nAfter beginning at Duke as an assistant strength and conditioning coach (2011-12), he broke into the coaching side in 2013 as an offensive quality control assistant. That year, Duke finished 10-4, winning the ACC's Coastal Division and finishing as the first Blue Devil team in 52 years to end a season ranked in the Associated Press poll (No. 23 final ranking).\n\nJohnson spent three years in the quality control role at Duke before being promoted to offensive line coach for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. During the 2017 campaign, Johnson worked with Third Team All-ACC center Austin Davis, who was also one of four team-elected captains.\n\nJohnson's offensive line opened holes for Duke to have two 200-200 (rushing and passing yards) performances as the Blue Devils reached the Quick Lane Bowl. Off the field, Johnson oversaw the selection of offensive tackle Gabe Brandner to the CoSIDA Academic All-District First Team and Allstate AFCA Good Works Team as well as being a semifinalist for the National Football Foundation William V. Campbell Trophy and Wuerffel Award. In 2016, Johnson guided an offensive front that allowed time and space for four 200-200 performances during the season.\n\nDuring Johnson's three campaigns with the Blue Devil offense in the capacity of quality control, Duke won 27 games, captured the 2013 ACC Coastal Division championship and appeared in three bowl games. Working alongside veteran line coach John Latina, Johnson helped guide seven All-ACC picks including Casey Blaser, Takoby Cofield, Dave Harding, Lucas Patrick, Perry Simmons, Matt Skura and Laken Tomlinson.\n\nDuke went 8-5 with a victory over Indiana in the 2015 New Era Pinstripe Bowl, and the Blue Devils joined Clemson and North Carolina as the only three squads to rank among the conference's top five in rushing offense, passing offense, total offense and scoring offense. Blaser, Patrick and Skura each garnered All-ACC honors.\n\nIn 2013, Duke ranked among ACC leaders in scoring (fifth; 32.8 avg.), total offense (fourth; 426.1 avg.), rushing offense (fifth; 178.0 avg.) and passing offense (sixth; 248.1 avg.).\n\nOn its way to the ACC Coastal Division championship, the Blue Devils set a school record for total points (459) while becoming the first team in school history to post at least 25 rushing touchdowns and 25 passing touchdowns in the same season.\n\nA standout offensive lineman in his playing days at Ole Miss (2001-04), Johnson earned Second Team All-SEC honors as a senior co-captain under Cutcliffe. He helped the Rebels to 28 wins over four years and a pair of bowl game appearances. After earning Second Team All-SEC honors from the Associated Press as a senior, Johnson represented Ole Miss at the 2004 Senior Bowl.\n\nHe was a second-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft by Minnesota, and spent four seasons (2005-08) there, helping the Vikings to a division title and playoff berth in 2008. After spending the 2009 campaign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he closed his playing career with the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League.\n\nJohnson graduated from Ole Miss in 2004 with a degree in criminal justice while minoring in sociology. He and his wife, Veullana, are the parents of London, Meraki and Violette."
