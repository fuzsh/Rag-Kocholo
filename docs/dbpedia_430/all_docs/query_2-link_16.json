        "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue Football got going on a new week of fall camp today with Monday's session representing the fifth day of practice in the build up for the new season.\n\nThe head ball coach, Ryan Walters, had his weekly appointment with the press and was followed by offensive lineman Marcus Mbow and tight end Drew Biber.\n\nMbow, who enters his junior season in 2024, looks to help the offense take a step forward in the second year under Walters. The stalwart along the line has battled back from an injury that kept him out of the back half of last season.\n\n\"After my injury, I knew what had to be done as soon as it happened,\" Mbow said. \"I kind of just attacked that and went about every day trying to push myself, trying to get the most done that I could that day one day at a time until I got back.\"\n\nThe Milwaukee native played a huge role in helping the Boilermakers record their most rushing touchdowns (20) since 2018. Walters and his staff are excited to have him back out on the field.\n\n\"He's better than he was a year ago for sure,\" Walters said of Mbow's recovery. \"He's really attacked his rehab, and he's another guy that's grown in a leadership role. He's as athletic of a tackle as I've been around, so I'm glad he's on our team.\"\n\nThe Purdue tight end room was represented for the second straight media session with Biber echoing his running mate Max Klare's sentiments from Friday on the depth the Boilermakers have at the position. The group is poised to be a deep and multifaceted weapon for this offense.\n\n\"The tight end room is really good, and I'm really excited to be in it because iron sharpens iron,\" Biber said. \"Whatever role I get I'm going to do it as hard as I can because I want to get on the field and help this team succeed…I've been really working on my blocking. Just trying to make plays out there.\"\n\nThe Boilermakers have their first practice in full pads tomorrow (Aug. 6)."
