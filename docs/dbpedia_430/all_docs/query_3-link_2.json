In our presentation, we highlighted the usefulness of Bayesian networks and the complexity of their creation, before explaining the method we developed to generate them automatically through the Causality Link platform, with an example on the prediction of the price of crude oil. Congratulations to our fellow finalists and to our team members Dr. Olav Laudy and Allen Ginsberg for co-authoring this breakthrough research!

Shout out to Henry Zhan for his pivotal role. üìà Project Spotlight: This study delves into characteristic variables of identified stock manipulations in China during 2020, analyzing 42 manipulated stocks against a backdrop of 99 blue-chip stocks. üõ†Ô∏è Approach: Our methodology involved hypothesis testing and logistic regression to understand patterns of stock manipulation behaviors. üí° Key Findings: We identified Tradable Share Volume as a significant indicator. This underlines the risk of trading overly-diluted companies in the Chinese Market.

Now, we'd say that's pretty impressive, right? üò≤ Yet, breaking into IB is tough and requires a lot of work. üìù One of the biggest slip-ups? Not prepping enough for those behaviorals.

Smith School of Business will discuss how, when it comes to volatility, Brownian motion is blind and unable to distinguish three important aspects of motion. These are speed, the rate of motion in time, scale, the rate of motion in space, and the degree of continuity in motion or the relativity of speed to scale at small scales. The third is lost by being continuous, the first two are identified with each other by the scaling property. By focusing attention on discontinuous approximations to continuity instead, one is able to distinguish all three and then ask what is stochastic when volatility is stochastic. Is it speed, scale, or the degree of continuity? Models of stochastic speed are formulated by adapting current speeds going forward to realized speeds looking back. When they are calibrated to SPX option prices it is shown that they directly imply, via an endogenous construction of the volatility of volatility, the prices for options on both volatility and variance. Stylized facts observed in VIX option prices are then directly derived from SPX option prices.
