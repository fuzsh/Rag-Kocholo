I knew then, that's where I wanted to be and it's close to home.\"\n\n4-star S Kendall Daniels Jr. (Norfolk, Va.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Maury vs. Wise (Upper Marlboro, Md.)\n\nThe stats in 2023: NA\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"The culture and the coaches.

Also, what made me want to commit was just being on my visits and realizing that if I commit there, I will be put in a place to succeed and make it to a high-level.\"\n\n4-star WR Jayden Sellers (Florence, S.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: West Florence, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: In three games, Sellers caught 12 passes for 148 yards and a touchdown; rushed eight times for 95 yards and two touchdowns\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"This puts South Carolina up, like number one on the list, because he's there,\" Jayden said, after his brother, LaNorris, signed with the Gamecocks. \"I want to stay close to home. That's something that's important to me in the recruiting process.\"\n\n3-star edge (LB) Taeshawn Alston (Henderson, N.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Vance County at Warren County, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: In seven games, Alston had 27 tackles, including nine for loss with five sacks\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"I would say the atmosphere and culture are why I'm committing to South Carolina. It feels like home, a place for me to be around people that I can relate to and call family. I really like everything about South Carolina's coaches. They are great people. ... They are all about their players.\"\n\n3-star ATH Jaquel Holman (Blackville, S.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Blackville-Hilda vs. Barnwell, Aug. 22\n\nThe stats in 2023: Rushed 153 times for 1,610 yards and 26 touchdowns; 76 tackles, including nine for loss, five quarterback hurries three forced fumbles, one sack and an interception\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"It was really the hospitality. The coaching staff. Man, I love the coaching staff. Shane Beamer is an outstanding coach. Me and coach (Clayton) White, we have a bond. We could talk about anything besides football. What I want to do in college and how the family was doing. I talked to coach (Torrian) Gray. When I went up there yesterday, I was like, yeah, this is the place for me.\"\n\n3-star LB Donovan Darden (Havelock, N.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Havelock vs. Wallace-Rose Hill, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: 46 tackles, including nine for loss with 10 quarterback hurries, six pass breakups, two interceptions and a sack. Offensively, Darden accounted for 283 total yards (143 rushing, 140 passing) and three touchdowns (two rushing, one passing)\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"It's one of the best environments I've seen, especially in person. It just seems like the fans are all in with it.\"\n\nDE Kobby Sakyi-Prah (Roswell, Ga.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Roswell at Peachtree Ridge, Aug. 16\n\nThe stats in 2023: Injured\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"It was all the head coach, to be honest, coach Beamer. Mainly the coaches, their work-ethic, the way they treat the players, the way coach Beamer is doing basically everything. He's not just chilling, sitting in his office. He's everywhere, taking the lead in everything. Obviously, he's the head coach – most schools you go there, and you don't even see the head coach at all. Coach Beamer, you go there, and he's everywhere you go. He takes his time to have a conversation with you every time he sees you. He tries to get to know you. He's a good coach in general. I just thought it felt like home when I went on the visit there. I love the campus. It's not too far from home also. It's about 3.5 hours, so that's really one of the main reasons why I committed there.\"\n\n3-star QB Cutter Woods (Anderson, S.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Westside vs. Creekside, Aug. 24\n\nThe stats in 2023: Completed 220 of 317 passes (69.4 percent) for 3,915 yards with 42 touchdowns and eight interceptions, rushed for 345 yards with five scores\n\nThoughts on South Carolina:\"I love to play with, I would say pro-style, which is also a reason I want to go play for coach Loggains. He loves pro-style quarterbacks. Just play hard and just be a quarterback. My high school coach always tells me, 'You are a playmaker by getting it to your playmakers. You get to the ball to your guys and it makes you look good.'\"\n\n3-star edge Anthony Addison (Sumter, S.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Sumter vs. Lakewood, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: 96 tackles, including 25 for loss with six sacks\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"It's about the people that make the college. I know they're bringing in the right people and we'll have a successful next four years. I believe in coach Beamer and his program. I know coach (Sterling) Lucas is a good developmental coach. I can tell, because when I've been going to (spring) practices, and I've been watching the freshmen that they've been putting in and the new guys they're putting in. They're all producing. There's no defensive end on South Carolina that's not producing right now. They're all eating.\"\n\n3-star S Damarcus Leach (Abbeville, S.C.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Abbeville vs. Southside Christian, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: NA\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"Just hearing the academics and how things were run, just getting the whole tour of the building from nutrition to how the people in study hall, how the day will be, strength coach, all the way down to your trainers and whatever you may need, all the way down to the locker room and equipment guy.\"\n\n3-star CB Christopher Hatfield (Lincolnton, Ga.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Long County vs. Vidalia, Aug. 16\n\nThe stats in 2023: 27 tackles, including two for loss with two interceptions and three pass breakups, with nine catches for 195 yards and five touchdowns\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"Especially with the academics, with them helping you and caring, it's literally impossible for you to fail at that university, especially being a student-athlete, because of all the help they give you. Just that, helping with academics and all that. The city's amazing, the campus is amazing, so I feel like it was definitely the best fit for me and the best fit for me and my family.\"\n\n3-star LB AJ Holloway (Buford, Ga.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Buford at Milton, Aug. 16\n\nThe stats in 2023: 45 tackles, including five for loss and one interception\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"What excites me most about South Carolina is their rich tradition of player development and the vibrant atmosphere at Williams-Brice Stadium. I've witnessed firsthand the dedication and effort required to be a football player at SC, and I can envision myself thriving in that environment.\"\n\n3-star TE Preston Douglas (North Palm Beach, Fla.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Benjamin at Dwyer, Aug. 16\n\nThe stats in 2023: At Jupiter, Douglas caught 23 passes for 455 yards and nine touchdowns. Defensively, he had 28 tackles, including nine for loss with one sack and an interception\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"They see me as a receiving threat and someone who can get downhill, but someone who can jump in, put my hand on the ground and make some good blocks for the team. … Kind of what I did in high school, bouncing back and forth between the slot and H-back, hand in the ground and all that. That's exactly what I wanted.\"\n\n3-star K Max Kelley (Gallatin, Tenn.)\n\nFirst game in 2024: Gallatin at Hendersonville, Aug. 23\n\nThe stats in 2023: 9-of-12 on field goals with a long of 45; 33-of-38 on extra-points; 63-of-67 kickoffs for touchback\n\nThoughts on South Carolina: \"I have been blessed to be recruited by many top schools and have seen what they had to offer. But none of those schools have the opportunity for a specialist to grow and develop like I would at USC. First of all, you have a special teams coordinator with a reputation like none other in Joe (DeCamillis) and he is backed up by a special teams minded head coach in Coach Beamer. Beyond that, the core values of the team spoke to me with love being the top priority. It spoke to me because the Bible says to first love one another. I have been raised in a Christian home and to know that these coaches are going to not only feed me athletically, academically, as well as spiritually was a big deciding factor for me. I am excited to finish out my high school journey with a strong senior year, but I can't wait to begin my career as a Gamecock.\""
