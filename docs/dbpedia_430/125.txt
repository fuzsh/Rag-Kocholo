Fullback Marcus Rose played his rugby for Cambridge University, Coventry and Harlequins, earning ten caps for England between 1981 and 1987. After Dusty Hare had played in the first two matches of the 1981 Five Nations, Marcus took over for the game against Ireland, during which he scored 11 points. He also played against the French at Twickenham, but his four second half penalties were not enough to overhaul a 16 point halftime deficit and France won 16-12. Rose next turned out for the national side against Australia on a bitterly cold January day in 1982, scoring another three penalties in a 15-11 home victory. On the back of this victory, England had high hopes for the 1982 Five Nations, but got off to a bad start when they could only draw 9-9 with Scotland. They also lost their next match to Ireland thanks to a spectacular Gerry McLoughlin pushover try that Marcus was powerless to prevent despite his last ditch heroics.

That match proved to be Rose's last game for the best part of five years, and when he did resume his career in 1987 it was in a another defeat by Ireland. England also lost to France and Wales, but avoided the dreaded wooden spoon by beating Scotland in the last match at Twickenham, with Marcus scoring his side's first try of the competition. Rose then headed out to Australia as first choice full-back in England's World Cup party. Unfortunately, his tournament lasted exactly five minutes before he was taken off with concussion in England's opening match against Australia. He was replaced by Jonathan Webb, and so that game was Rose's last appearance for England. Marcus scored two tries, four conversions and 22 penalties to total 82 points in his ten Internationals.
