<p style='text-align: justify;'>This manuscript of medical treatises, recipes, and charms consists of five parts that were separately produced in the first half of the 15th century but probably joined together at an early stage. That the five parts were produced in the same milieu and perhaps always intended to be joined together is indicated by that fact that the manuscript was decorated throughout by the same hand, except for quires I, II, and IX (these three quires have all been copied by the same scribe and decorated by a different hand).</p><p style='text-align: justify;'>Dr Clarck Drieshen<br /> Project Cataloguer<br /> Cambridge University Library</p>
