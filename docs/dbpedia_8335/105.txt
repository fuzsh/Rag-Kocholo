That's what I had assumed, but after looking into it more, it seems Marshall has been handling US distribution directly for a few years now (since 2010). Note that Marshall USA is simply described as a "business unit" within Marshall ("Marshall Amplification PLC"), not even a subsidiary (subsidiaries are listed on p. 21 of their latest financial statements and appear to be all wholly-owned).

Maybe they decided the ridiculous profit margins on US items were working for them after all?

except...

if you go back a couple years, they were distributed in the US by US Music Corp...

USMC sold to Jam industries:

which rebranded as Exertis, which also owns KMC

which Fender once owned, etc... it's an incestuous industry over here...

A truly sad part is that USMC also handled the American warranty service for Marshall, and did a really good job of it. Who knows how and/or by who, such warranty support is currently being handled?

So sad that every aspect of our lives is being boiled down to the dollars & cents of corporate profits! Sure, profit has always been a main driving force in business, but never as ruthlessly and unconscionably as is the current trend!

Good info. That's a lot of people potentially clipping the ticket!

And they probably operate in the US, and thus are renting US space, paying US employees US salaries and benefits, etc. Not much different than using another US based distributor, unfortunately. Actually It was likely cheaper at first for them instead of using a middle man (remember the very reasonable costs for vintage moderns, origins, codes, dsls nd even the studios initially? And the cabs for the origin/mx line)..... But the past 3 years....back to the SOS.

Those costs would be similar (probably higher) in Australia, with less "economy of scale", and yet their prices aren't as outrageous. I suspect there are some particularly greedy actors in the corporate cesspit described above. It's very odd though - I can think of few brands where the products are more expensive in the US than elsewhere. This isn't how globalization is supposed to work!

Saw this post before I looked at the entire thread and thought, why would Marines be repairing amps?

I got here too late to see the prices in the link. Anyone care to share? I jonesing for a JTM 45 or clone, or possibly a kit to build myself. I love my SV20, but their price has skyrocketed since I bought mine in 2020.

I guess I should do some sort of avatar. I think my stock one just went to the Barbie movie.

I’m gonna have to play one in person to see what it’s really about. Idk if it’d make everyone with an SV20 or JTM45 think about it but I’m curious.

I’m not a tech but I’m wondering about the lack of a tube rectifier and what difference it makes in the circuit. Also is it shared cathode like an old JTM45? It makes me think it’s something more like one of the variations of a JTM50 over a JTM45 or JMP but idk anything about amp design.

I just want to try one in person and see how it stacks up to my SV20c. I’d trade a 1x10 combo for a ST20 head if I find a used one at a fair price months from now and like the sound more

Cool vid --- And I'm sure that Marshall will sell many of them

It appears to be different enough from the 4-input/NMV Studio amps they already make to be appealing to many players around the globe

I'm not interested in buying one myself however

But I hope this will be a successful amp for Marshall and that they continue to thrive, as a company, for many years to come
