        "text": "At Marshall Music, we pride ourselves on promoting a safe, positive, and efficient work environment that is vital to successfully performing our craft. We have well-stocked and supplied facilities, industry-leading repair equipment, and a team of long-time repair specialists who are dedicated to passing on the culture and traditions instilled by the Marshall family to new generations of technicians. All of our full-service technicians must accumulate 10,000 hours of on-the-job repair experience before being considered fully trained. Through their training, they are exposed to thousands of unique repair situations and are guided by the knowledge and wisdom of our master technicians (15+ years of experience). And many of our technicians are actively performing or are professional musicians who have a working knowledge of instrument performance and industry standards.\n\nAs a family-owned company, we understand what it means to work within a budget. That’s why we have some of the most competitive repair rates in the country. And when it comes to customer service, we have built a strong reputation for taking care of our customers through our dedication to providing service after the sale.\n\nBRASS INSTRUMENT CLEANING\n\nMarshall Music’s brass instrument cleaning process is a model of efficiency and sustainability. The process begins with a gentle degreasing using an environmentally safe, naturally-derived degreaser rather than the harmful petroleum-based degreasers used by some shops in the industry. Some instruments or individual parts are then then dipped in a static bath of mild acid to aid in the break down of calcium deposits before undergoing a polishing process that utilizes a non-abrasive, crystal powder-based acid compound to scrub the male and female sections of the instrument. This produces a highly polished finish that does not rely on scouring or damaging the instrument by removing material, unlike other methods utilized throughout the industry.\n\nOur instruments are then submerged in our industry standard ultrasonic cleaning machine, which uses a solution of 90 gallons water to one gallon of a mild acid, combined with sound waves, to gently and effectively scrub away deposits. The cleaning process is completed following a treatment with soapy water and a non-abrasive brass bristle wheel on raw slide tubes and some valves. This removes staining and polishes away any remaining deposits to leave a shiny and mechanically smooth finish. In addition to improving the aesthetic qualities of the instruments we service, our process of cleaning both interior and exterior components improves instrument functionality by ensuring maximum mechanical and acoustical performance.\n\nDENT REMOVAL, POLISHING, & CLEANING OF SILVER PLATED TRUMPET\n\nAt Marshall Music, we use classic industry standard tools, as well as a magnetic dent removal system, to remove dents and folds from the brass instruments we service. To restore the silver plated trumpet shown, our brass technician first begins by removing all dents before using our ultrasonic cleaner to remove corrosion and calcium deposits. The instrument then undergoes a polishing process which utilizes various chemicals and polishing compounds to remove tarnish. Finally, hand polishing is also used on occasion to clean up detailed areas of the instrument.\n\nPLASTIC CLARINET REPAD & MECHANICAL OVERHAUL\n\nPerforming a repad and mechanical overhaul is one of the most intensive processes we can perform on a woodwind instrument. A repad begins with the removal of all dirt, food deposits, and corrosion from the instrument. We then replace all wearable items, including pads and corks. All parts are then cleaned and all bright work polished. The instrument is then carefully inspected by a technician before being padded, corked, reassembled, adjusted, and regulated to factory specifications. At Marshall Music, we stand by the quality of our repair service. This is why we offer a 12-month materials and workmanship warranty on all of the repads/mechanical overhauls that we perform.\n\nBLADDER PAD REPLACEMENT\n\n(Flute Pads Shown)\n\nOver time, bladder pads can dry up and tear, losing their ability to seal properly over the tone holes. We use only high quality, double skin, natural felt pads for all of our woodwind repairs. Unlike the cheaper, low grade synthetic felts used by others shops in the industry, which don’t seal well and lack precision, we use high quality, natural, needle-pressed or woven felt pads, which seat better and last longer. We choose these higher grade felts for their precision and durability at a higher cost to us because we believe in protecting your repair service value and improving the performance of your instrument.\n\nLEATHER PAD REPLACEMENT\n\n(Saxophone Pads Shown)\n\nAs leather pads age, they dry out, shrink, harden, tear, and eventually lose their ability to seat properly against the tone holes of a woodwind instrument. Constant exposure to saliva, food deposits, condensation, and sugars inevitably causes deterioration and failure, which means pad replacement is required on a regular basis. We stock only the highest quality pads that feature consistent pneumatic leather sealing surfaces and dimensional stability. By using high grade materials in all of our pad work, we help ensure that you get the best performance and the longest life out of your instrument.\n\nBASSOON TENON REBUILD\n\nOur technicians have the knowledge, experience, and equipment to perform some of the most challenging woodwind repairs. Socket and tenon rebuilds are procedures that require great skill and precision to perform successfully. The slider above shows the transformation from a broken bassoon tenon to a repaired and functioning joint.\n\nA technician begins by counterboring the broken joint to create a foundation for the new tenon. With the use of a machine lathe, the technician then custom builds a tenon that matches both the internal dimension of the counterbore and the factory specifications of the original tenon. The newly built tenon is then grafted onto the counterbored joint and subsequently strung or corked. The final result is a tenon that has been restored to its original factory specifications and fits the instrument’s existing socket.\n\nCLARINET SOCKET REBUILD\n\nTo perform a socket rebuild, a technician begins by using a machine lathe to turn down (remove) the existing broken socket and prepare the joint for a new socket graft. A stock piece of raw material, which is chosen to match the instrument body, is then machined to the specifications of the original socket. The new socket is then grafted onto the prepared joint to complete the structural phase of the repair. Finally, the finish of the grafted piece is restored to best match the original finish of the instrument."
