        "text": "I also called Musicians Friend and received nearly the same response. The \"master\" system said March 31'st, he checked with his supervisor and they basically said they \"have no clue, but the march 31 date is the date from marshall\". They do not know if the \"Jan 17'th date is correct or if the 31'st date is correct\". Sounds like a complete cluster F. HOW, in this day in age, do they not know where the hell these things are and when they will arrive! I'm starting to think the waiting and delaying is actually part of the business process. Kinda like what Nintendo does. The delays and \"sold out\"ness builds hype for the company. They are probably waiting for a few magazines to write articles and such, more publication, more rep for marshall. If they simply \"put it out\", it would be old news.\n\nWHERE IS MY DAMN AFD 100, I NEED TO SOUND LIKE SLASH NOW! I NEED TO PLAY NIGHT TRAIN NOW! (kidding, but seriously, when am I going to get my damn amp!).\n\nThis is from a music store on ebay and he appears to have the most up to date info or at least forth coming with it.\n\n\"According to Marshall USA, they planned to ship them in January. They are built but are being set up to work on the USA's 120v power, so they are planning on them being ready to ship in February.\"\n\nIts seems to be from the same dealer on ebay where i did buy the AFD but i think i will go with what musicians friend info is cuz they are bigger, i'M sure they have more connections with marshall and more accurate info\n\nIt's very intersting that you won't get your AFD 100 until March. I say interesting because I am in the market for a Fender American Special Stratocaster and for just about every major music store I visit or call in Southern California, only one or two exist: the floor model. I talked to a manager from a big musical instrument chain and he said that Fender is not shipping anything to stores until March, which put me out of luck for a new Fender American Special Strat that is in the box (I hate buying floor model guitars and amps). If you look around, many stores have very thin inventories right now and it's hard to find more than one model guitar or amp. Many stores are even offering many guitars and amps at lower prices by listing them as \"clearance\" and \"close out.\" I encourage anyone to go to a music store and ask the sales rep how many quantaties he/she has in stock. Most stores will carry a few more of the cheaper guitars like Squier and Epiphone, but the higher end stuff seems to just be sitting out there in the form of floor models. I wondering if many manufacturers are waiting for NAMM's Los Angeles convention to end and then begin shipping products in February or March. Anyone in the know about this strange thinning of inventory?"
