Every so often a pivotal moment happens in the music industry where new rules are made, new standards are set and new eras begin. That happened this week at the Marshall Funhouse in Austin, Texas at SXSW. For three days the Marshall Funhouse took over one of SXSW‚Äôs most iconic venues in a colourful, charismatic and loud way with one key goal: To give back to the communities that make Austin such a vibrant and cultural city. Every day, we gave the stage to grassroots musicians from Austin who are pushing the boundaries of music and combined them with some of the most iconic names in the musical world such as Dinosaur Jr, The Black Angels, Shannon And The Clams and Frank Turner to name just a few. Of course, this was also coupled with a number of sensational bands from the Marshall Records family in a one of a kind showcase evening. Over the course of the event, we exemplified our belief that rock and roll is not a genre, but an attitude. And it demands your attention. At Marshall, we believe in giving back to the communities that help keep music alive and are actively working every day to inspire the next generation of musicians to plug in their guitars, turn up their amps and make their voices heard. That is why The Marshall Funhouse was not only a free event open to the general public, but featured a selected a number of partners who embody this ethos and are making real differences in their local communities. From School Of Rock, who are inspiring the next generation of musicians, to The SIMMS Foundation offering safe spaces for musicians and their support networks, to Women In Vinyl who are rewriting the rules and offering opportunities to women and non binary communities trying to navigate the musical world - there was something for everyone to get involved in. With over 20,000 attendees over the three days and countless memories and laughs along the way, we believe the Marshall Funhouse has changed live events forever‚Ä¶and there‚Äôs only more to come. üëÄüé™ #MarshallFunhouse #SXSW24"
