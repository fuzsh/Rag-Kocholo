        "text": "I saw this news in the morning on Guitar's Instagram. Marshall amps will now be under the control of the company that has been contracting with Marshall to produce inexpensive headphones and small speakers (Zound Industries).\n\nThe family will retain 24% of the company\n\nThoughts???\n\nView attachment 635362\n\nHas this sort of corporate acquisition ever worked out well for the consumer...\n\nAKA musicians...\n\nIs Jim still around? I saw a guy selling a couple large cabs a month or so ago with his signature inside them. Probably makes them worth more now.\n\nIf he's gone, \"the family\" probably doesn't have the personal (non-monetary) investment in it he had.\n\nYeah I get weepy over attrition eroding my old faves after the codgers in charge die off and corporate execs start restructuring for profitability or whatever they do when nobody is left to care about the reason the product originally came to market.\n\nFor all the complaints about GC Fender and Gibson those brands are all right with me.\n\nBut it does not always work that way.\n\nVox had a period of making real crap amps, like end of last Century. Not just cheap construction but they failed to understand what made them sound like they sound.\n\nMany brand names get bought and we end up with a whole new set of products in look alike boxes.\n\nGuess we will see?\n\nHow does an amp builder get made more profitable?\n\nBy staying the same?\n\nIs Jim still around? I saw a guy selling a couple large cabs a month or so ago with his signature inside them. Probably makes them worth more now.\n\nIf he's gone, \"the family\" probably doesn't have the personal (non-monetary) investment in it he had.\n\nJim wrapped up above ground living 11 years ago at 88.\n\nAbout 15 years ago I built a JTM45 head kit that I modded into a JTM50 . I still have it, and that is enough Marshall amp for me.\n\nYeah that is a plus, we can make our own.\n\nI would like a nice Plexi with a modern gain channel added, not building that myself.\n\nAlways wanted a Marshall stack, but the right deal has never come my way. I do have a Marshall bass amp that I like. But, some nice Fender amps have come my way and they do a pretty good job.\n\nThe issue isn't so much 'who owns the company' as to whether they will stick with the design and build ethos of Marshall prior to takeover. If we start to see loads of products that use the Marshall logo, but are aimed at general consumers, or guitar amps that really aren't that great, we'll know its a \"CBS job\" where the new owners just want to reduce costs. Let's hope that isn't the way it plays out.\n\nThe issue isn't so much 'who owns the company' as to whether they will stick with the design and build ethos of Marshall prior to takeover.
