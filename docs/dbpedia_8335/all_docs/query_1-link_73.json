        "text": "Hartley Peavey became one of the key drivers in the musical instrument industry by adhering to a very simple philosophy – innovate in order to sell products at a price that people could afford. You can't talk to Hartley without that phrase coming up a couple of times and that's the kind of focus that leads clever people to success.\n\nHe has all the personal qualities you would expect from of an innovator. He's a creative, out-of-the box thinker with an appreciation of history coupled with an excited eye to the future. He has a thorough knowledge of how MI manufacturing companies got to where they are today and he is completely unafraid of taking risks.\n\nPeavey is located in Meridian, Mississippi, which was flattened during the American Civil War and then rebuilt to become the leading manufacturing center in the south in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Hartley Peavey is one of its most prominent native sons. He's a firm believer in his own business instincts, having \"tried out a bunch of guys with MBAs and run them off when I decided that my education from Mississippi wasn't so bad after all.\".\n\nHis company has been responsible for many innovations within the musical instruments industry. Many of these innovations have been in manufacturing techniques that are beneath the radar of most musicians, but others have been more notable. For those of us that remember, in 1989 Peavey launched the DPM series, which were the first major electronic keyboard products to use off the shelf DSPs in lieu of a custom ASIC, which was the strategy of the other major players at the time. They even marketed an early MIDI fader controller called the PC-1600x, a useful product and ahead of its time in 1992.\n\nIn 1993 Peavey marketed MediaMatrix, the first digitally networked audio solution, which is deployed in such diverse locations as the Beijing International Airport in China, the US Capitol, the Opryland Convention Center in Tennessee, and over a quarter of the NFL stadiums in North America. More recently they have entered the software plug-in market with ReValver and the MuseBox.\n\nMy personal experiences with the company began in the 70s. I went into my local music store thinking I wanted to buy a Marshall amp and discovered what they cost. I walked out with a Peavey, which sounded great and I didn't have to rob a bank to pay for it. As I later learned this was a critical part of their sales strategy and part of Hartley's aforementioned reason d'etre; Deliver great value at an affordable price and (probably because his father owned a music store), form close relationships with the dealer network.\n\nPeavey recently celebrated his 47th year of business.\n\nWell, there's no substitute for 47 years of experience....\n\nMy little education from Mississippi State wasn't so bad after all. I gave the commencement address there last year. I told them the truth. A diploma is little more than a learner's permit. When I graduated from college I thought I knew something. I soon figured out that I had plenty to learn.\n\nHow did you get involved in musical instruments in the first place?\n\nI never wanted to be in the manufacturing business. I love music and I love musicians. At that time in my life everybody I knew who was a musician always told me some version of the same thing. They all said, \"I wish somebody would make good gear at a fair price.\" And this was circa 1964. In the mid-60s a Vox Super Beetle sold for $1500.\n\nI remember. It had a sort of mini-scaffold around it.\n\n.\n\nYou must've done something innovative to allow you to sell products for less money or was it just that you didn't feel that you needed to make as much?\n\nWhen did you decide you wanted to participate?\n\nIn 1957 I went to a Bo Diddley concert in Laurel, Mississippi. I went nuts and told my dad that I wanted to be a guitar player. And he said, \"No, you don't want to be a guitar player. This rock 'n' roll, it'll never last and guitar players don't pay their bills.\" I insisted so he said, \"Okay, well I'll get you some lessons and if you learn how to play then I'll think about getting you a guitar.\" And of course that wasn't good enough for me. I got an old crappy guitar and made my own pickup. Then I asked him for an amp, and I got the same answer. \"No, when you learn how to play I'll think about getting you an amp.\" So I built my own amplifier with 4x12 speakers and 35 watts, which at that time was a big amplifier.\n\nHow did you acquire the skills to build those things?\n\nHow did you get started?\n\nSo it'd get overdriven sooner....\n\nSo, automatically, completely unknowingly, Jim Marshall invented the so-called \"Marshall Sound\" by using a different tube. The amplifier was set up for 6L6s but he put a higher gain tube in there, the EL34, and then the \"Marshall Sound\" was born. That's how that happened.\n\nWhen Marshalls first started coming into the States, the kit alone was $1000, and in those days you could buy output tubes, 6L6s and EL34s, for about a buck, buck and a half. Marshall had three 12X7s and about seven or eight dollars worth of output tubes and maybe $30 worth of transformers, a few resistors and a chassis and he was selling it for $1000 and I looked at that and thought, I can do it for a hell of a lot less than that. So I set up a little woodshop in my parent's basement and started the business selling a guitar amp and a bass amp. I would go into musical instrument shops and say, \"I have a new line of amplifiers I'd like to show you.\" \"Yeah, well what's it called?\" \"It's a Peavey.\" \"What?\" \"You know, Peavey. P-E-A-V-E-Y.\" \"Son, get out.\".\n\nSo one time in Montgomery, Alabama, a dealer said, \"Son, I'm not interested in your guitar amps because I've got plenty of those, but if you had a good sound system, I'd be very interested in that.\" So I designed a PA system.\n\nSo how were you different with your PA products?\n\nAnd those aluminum extrusions became a signature design thing for Peavey...\n\nYeah, that was trademarked.\n\nWhat kept other, more-established companies from doing something similar?\n\nThey didn't consider me serious competition. They thought I was just some little redneck kid from Mississippi, which was a wonderful thing for me. When rock 'n' roll exploded the first time, it was in the mid '50s, and that was at a time when Bill Ludwig owned Ludwig, the Steinway family owned Steinway, and Leo Fender owned Fender, and music manufacturing was a family business. By the early '60s music had kind of gotten stale. The Brits had been so impressed with American rock 'n roll music that they repackaged it and sold it back to us and that became the British Invasion. And that's when the Beatles and the Rolling Stones came along. So in the early '60s through most of the '70s, the conglomerates came in. This is when CBS bought Fender. Norlin bought Gibson. LTVJ, bought Altec Lansing. This is when Beatrice Foods, you know, \"Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee\", they bought JBL.\n\nI didn't know about Beatrice Foods and JBL. That's pretty funny in retrospect....\n\nWell, they did. All of these people jumped in the business. Prices skyrocketed and quality went to hell. When CBS bought Fender in 1965, a Stratocaster wholesale in a case was $162.50. I know that price very well because I was saving money to buy one.\n\nAll of this was heaven for me because I had a different strategy -building \"good product\" at an affordable price. It could be frustrating sometimes. I'd see catalogs from Fender and they had four-color catalogs and I was doing my catalog in black and white on newsprint.\n\nAnd, I never wanted to get into the guitar business, but I did because my major competitors at that time, were going into the dealers and saying, \"Well if you don't stock our amplifiers one to one, or our PAs one to one, we're not going to sell you our guitars.\" So I said: OK, I'll fight fire with fire and get in the guitar business.\n\nSo in order to compete with them we pioneered the use of computer-controlled machines to make guitars. Everybody was saying you can't make guitars with computers. Well, to some degree that is correct. But you can make very precise guitar parts with computers. Of course they have to essentially be assembled by hand, but that's what I did. I produced precision guitar parts and eliminated the slop. And any guitar made today, in any quantity, is made that way. Martin is making them that way. Taylor is making them that way. I did it in 1976. So that's my MO. That's the way I tend to do things."
