        "text": "London, 19th August 2021 Today, genre bending duo Nova Twins have announced a partnership with Marshall Records. In a forward-thinking deal that favours the artist and includes opportunities with Marshall Amplification, Marshall intends to drive positive change within the music industry, helping to break the mould of expectations when it comes to artist-label relationships.\n\nNova Twins (Amy Love and Georgia South): “We’re so happy to be extending our team by joining forces with Marshall on this new venture. Marshall understands how to work with independent artists like us, creating a unique and fair partnership that puts us, our rights and our music first, giving us the freedom to be ourselves. This should be the industry standard. Marshall have already been so accommodating and we’ve loved having access to their brand-new studio to record new tracks. We’re so excited to embark on this journey with them and see what the future holds!”\n\n“Releasing our debut album in collaboration with the 333 Wreckords Crew was amazing. We continue to be a part of the artist collective and receive advice from Jason Aalon Butler, who’s endless support means the world to us. He’s a rare gem in this industry. The Nova family just got bigger. Watch this space!”\n\nSteve Tannett, Music Director at Marshall Amplification and responsible for Marshall Records, Marshall Live Agency and Marshall Studio gives us his insight: “The music industry has been ever-evolving since I joined it in the seventies. Marshall as a company is going back to its core beliefs and doing exactly what Jim Marshall did all those years ago – listening to the next generation of artists and their needs. This partnership is holistic, it ensures we build a strategy that meets the goals of the band. It goes beyond the current industry standards and gives this incredibly talented band the platform they deserve. In all my years I’ve never been prouder to have an agreement where I know the artist is the most important person in the deal. Marshall is pioneering the way for future recording agreements.”\n\nFollowing their critically acclaimed debut album, Nova Twins have started recording new music at Marshall’s recently built, state of the art studio at their HQ in Milton Keynes. More on that very soon…\n\nFurther reading:\n\nNova Twins:\n\nNova Twins are innovative in every element of what they do as artists, whether that’s performing to moshing crowds, art directing their own music videos or designing & making their outfits for all photoshoots & stage-wear. Described as “devilishly-heavy & vivid punk-rock” by NME, “grunge-pop” by the Independent & “amalgamation of raw punk energy, illegal rave electronics & unapologetic grimey attitude” by PRS.\n\nTheir debut album Who Are The Girls? produced by Jim Abbiss (Adele, Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian) received much praise from publications such as Clash, Kerrang, Dork, NME & Alternative Press. Lead singles ‘Devil’s Face’, ‘Vortex’, ‘Taxi’ & ‘Play Fair’ have received spins on BBC Radio 1 from Annie Mac, Daniel P Carter & Jack Saunders, as well as BBC Radio 6 from Iggy Pop & Tom Robinson.\n\nOn tour they’ve supported Wolf Alice, Prophets of Rage, Skunk Anansie & have been invited to support Enter Shikari and Bring Me The Horizon in 2021. Previous festivals bookings have included Boomtown, Download & Hellfest. 2021 will see slots at Reading & Leeds amongst many others.\n\nIn 2019 Nova Twins were the face of Dr. Martens Alternative A/W campaign & played alongside Fever 333 during their BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session. In 2020, they won Best UK Breakthrough Band at the Heavy Music Awards. Later that year, they collaborated with Bring Me The Horizon on track ‘1X1’, taken from the No. 1 album – Post Human : Survival Horror. So far 2021 has seen nominations in the AIM Awards “One to Watch” category, as well as a return to the Heavy Music Awards with nods in both “Best UK Band” and “Best Video” categories.\n\nMarshall Amplification:\n\nMarshall Amplification has a vibrant and dynamic history within the music industry and is celebrated by some of the greatest artists in the world. Catapulted from humble beginnings in Hanwell, London, Marshall is now a global brand achieving manufacturing excellence. Creativity and innovation are at the heart of the business and every product they create. With over 55 years of music experience, Marshall continues to push the boundaries of possibility for the musicians of the future.\n\nFor further information on Nova Twins please contact:\n\nEmma Van Duyts at Public City / em@publiccitypr.com\n\nFor further information on Marshall Records please contact:"
