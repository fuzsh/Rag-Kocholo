        "text": "Swedish tech company Zound Industries is acquiring Marshall Amplification. The two will launch the newly formed Marshall Group as one company.\n\nMarshall Amplification signed a licensing deal with Zound back in 2010 to bring the Marshall brand to an entirely new market. A range of headphones and speakers were created bearing the Marshall brand, while retaining the look of Marshall’s classic guitar amplifiers. Now that partnership has been so successful the two companies will join forces to create the Marshall Group.\n\nMarshall Amplification and Zound Industries will see the two companies become one under the Marshall Group name—with annual revenues of $360 million with double-digit profitability.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Zound Industries will acquire Marshall Amplification and the Marshall family will become the largest shareholder of the newly formed group. The deal includes all of Marshall Amplification brands and subsidiaries, including Natal Drums, Marshall records, and Marshall Live Agency.\n\n“With this game-changing deal, Marshall Group will become the main challenger in our industry and the most exciting alternative to traditional players, bringing even greater innovation and value to clients, employees, and investors alike,” adds Henri de Bodinat, Chairman of Zound Industries and now Marshall Group.\n\nThe Marshall Family will own 24% of the newly formed group. Victoria and Terry Marshall—heirs of their father Jim Marshall—who founded the company with his son Terry in 1962, together with Jim’s granddaughter Joanne Marshall-Price, Paul Marshall, and the Marshall Charitable Trust will play key roles in the new entity to ensure the legacy of the famous Marshall sound and brand. Terry and Victoria Marshall will join the board of Marshall Group.\n\n“Since my father and I created the original Marshall amp back in 1962, we have always looked to deliver the pioneering Marshall sound to music lovers of all backgrounds and music tastes across the world,” adds Terry Marshall. “I’m confident that the Marshall Group will elevate this mission and spur the love for the Marshall brand.”\n\n“With Marshall Group, the potential to further impact an ever-modernizing music industry is a highly genuine one,” adds Victoria Marshall. “Together, we shall preserve the Marshall legacy and shape the future of ‘Live Loud.’ Having worked alongside my father during his later years, I know he would be excited at this direction and the potential to reach a larger worldwide audience with innovation and passion, which he always had in spades.”"
