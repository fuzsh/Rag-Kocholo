        "text": "Marshall’s first foray into the smartphone world won’t have Apple and Samsung sweating their stake in the market. But the guitar-amp company’s first mobile device does come with a few unique features that could show up in future iterations of the iPhone and Galaxy lineup.\n\nThe new Marshall London is an Android Lollipop phone custom-fitted for music lovers, with a dedicated processor for high-resolution audio (including uncompressed FLAC files), a pair of headphone jacks built into it, some decent-looking Marshall Mode earbuds, a top-mounted button that quickly fires up the phone’s music UI, a five-band global equalizer, and a scroll wheel for adjusting volume with precision while it’s in your pocket. It also scratches a couple more-conventional smartphone itches, with a user-replaceable 2500mAh battery and a MicroSD storage slot.\n\nWhile the phone hasn’t officially been announced in the U.S. just yet—there’s a page on Marshall’s Swedish site that lists all the phone’s features and specs—it will be in a few hours according to the site’s countdown clock. There’s no pricing information on the U.S. version of the site for now.\n\nHardware differentiation and specialization are growing trends in the smartphone universe—we have “luxury” phones from Vertu and Lamborghini, a smartphone with a large image sensor from Panasonic, and Samsung’s wrap-around Edge screen, for example—but any successful hook will likely show up in market-leading phones before long. Dual-headphone jacks and hi-res audio capabilities seem like features that may become mainstream soon.\n\nHow to Clear Your Watch History on Netflix, Apple TV+, YouTube, and More\n\nHiding your streaming habits increases your privacy and improves the recommendations you see. Here’s how to clear your viewing history on every major streamer.\n\nOmega’s AI Will Map How Olympic Athletes Win\n\nFrom gymnast-tracking to pole vault measurements mid-jump, the watch brand’s Swiss Timing division has a whole host of new timing tech for Paris 2024.\n\nThe Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers\n\nIf you’re a side sleeper, you need a mattress that provides support and relieves pressure. I’m a side sleeper, and I tested the top foam, cooling, and firm mattresses to find the best.\n\nWhy the Global CrowdStrike Outage Hit Airports So Hard\n\nThe aviation industry is optimized within an inch of its life. A bad software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike took down computers running Microsoft Windows—and a cascade of airports with it.\n\nThe Best Barefoot Shoes for Walking or Running\n\nOur favorite zero-drop, minimalist footwear will let you feel the ground beneath your feet.\n\nLCD, IPS, OLED, and Quantum Dots: All the Confusing Display Terms, Explained\n\nShopping for monitors can feel like swimming through alphabet soup. Learn what all these technical acronyms mean before you buy.\n\nThese Are the Android Phones Worth Buying\n\nShopping for a new phone can be an ordeal. Let us take some of the pain out of it with these WIRED-tested picks and tips.\n\nExpress Yourself With the Best AirPods Cases\n\nFrom a can of Spam to a mini suitcase, these are our favorite ways to disguise (and protect) Apple’s wireless earbuds and over-the-ear headphones."
