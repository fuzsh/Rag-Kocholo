        "text": "I have it from a very good source that Marshall is floundering without a leader. Jim is stroked out to the point of being useless, (Sorry to hear that) and his daughter is not running things anymore. Apparently his son Terry, is a musician and has no interest in running the company. Their distribution will now be US Music, which handles Randall, Eden, Washburn, etc... It seems from my source that if US Music takes charge of that, it's a real possibility that they could purchase Marshall at some point.\n\nJust imagine all Marshall products made in China/Singapore......\n\nCould be the end of an era folks...... bummer.\n\nThat sucks if it comes to pass. All the more reason to keep my unadulterated non modded Marshalls. Thanks for the information. Who knows what other world economic influences are at play here as well. None the less can't say I didn't see it coming with all of the foreshadowing.\n\nDavid\n\nMy God, can you imagine setting around in 20 years discussing wether or not your Marshall is Pre CBS (or what ever) or not, lol, wow! Never really occured to me until now. Sometimes we just take things for granted.\n\nDavid\n\nYeah, perhaps if you have a British made Marshall, it will be worth $$$$$$$ in 20 years!\n\nWell that sux if it proves true, but let's see: a spankin' new middle priced get up sets ya back easy a grand, and for the same dough you can get a vintage dealy combo or head that sounds way better. Is it really a big surprise that the big dog might have been getting weak for a while now? Let's face it folks, The MG era (if not maybe earlier) has destroyed Marshall's tone, and the market share is falling. Cheap asian crap dominates all facets of electronic manufacture, and the regular guy simply can't afford to drop two grand on a rig. Now add in all of this digital modelling stuff available for cheap, ebay, big box music stores full of other choices, and say goodbye to the alpha dog. I can't say for sure that I won't be sad about something like losing Marshall to Chinese and Korean built junk, but hasn't that already happened? I think the main result would just be what we've been offered for the past decade, but with even cheaper enclosures. Sorry, but I'll just continue to buy older stuff- no change for me."
