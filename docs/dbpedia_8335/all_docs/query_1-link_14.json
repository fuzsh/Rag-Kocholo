Zound Industry might be poised to la7nch Bluetooth guitar amplification with ear buds. Can you say ‘ideal home/bedroom amp’.\n\nI am rather technologically backwards, but my sister has hearing aids that are linked to her phone…..it rings and talks in her ear!\n\n1stpitch\n\nTele-Afflicted\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 19, 2019\n\nPosts\n\n1,379\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Carolina, USA\n\nAnother Zounds buys Marshall thread?"
