        "text": "Hello,\n\nI have been thinking about it, and i am strongly suspicious that Blackstar Amplification is in fact set up and funded by Marshall Amplification.\n\nOn this page, it explains how Blackstaramps was formed when the Engineering team of Marshall Amplification simply got up and walked out of Marshall Amplification to set up their own company (Blackstaramps)..........\n\nMeet Your Maker - Blackstar Amplification\n\nlink repeated here in case above link breaks:\n\nhttp://www.blackstaramps.co.uk/about/meet-your-maker.php\n\n........Hold on a minute, i just cannot see Jim Marshall (MD of Marshall Amplification) agreeing to this!!!!!!.........at least he would have taken them for a ride in court?\n\n-Even more so since Marshall Amplification is based in Milton Keynes, UK, and Blackstaramps is based just 15 miles away in Northampton, UK.\n\nMaking things more suspicious is this weblink where Jim Marshall is singing the praises of the Engineer who left him to set up Blackstaramps................(near bottom of article)......\n\nJim Marshall Interview\n\nlink repeated here in case above link breaks:\n\nhttp://www.premierguitar.com/archive/interviews/jim_marshall.htm\n\n.......i doubt that Jim Marshall would allow such things to be printed if Blackstar really was set up in competition with Marshall.\n\nJim Marshall is no slouch, he wouldnt allow his Best-Engineer-Ever to simply walk off and become a competitor to him......-recently Jim Marshall has been producing Marshall Fridges and other white goods......showing that he is still very keen on the world of business and innovation.\n\nI believe that Jim Marshall secretly funds Blackstaramps, and that he started it in order to explore new improved Guitar amp technology.\n\n...for one thing, i think he is using Blakstaramps to get even more into the world of Class D guitar amplifiers, supplied by SMPS's with DSP enhanced sound....whilst at the same time maintaining his lucrative Marshall Amplification business\n\nIf you read the above i am sure you will agree.\n\nNo Managing Director in the world lets his best staff just up-sticks and take his market share....-this just does NOT happen in the real world......specially not an innovator and slick-handed businessman like Jim Marshall.\n\nI am convinced that Blackstaramps is owned and funded by Marshall Amplification.\n\nDo you agree?"
