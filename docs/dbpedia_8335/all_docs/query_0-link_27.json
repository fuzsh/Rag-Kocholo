They're still on the board and likely will have input at least on the guitar amplification side of things.\n\nIt also invariably means apart from the hand soldered and made in UK goodness that everyone lusts for, there's a possibility we get some revamping of their budget lines and more MIC products. If marketed correctly, I can't see how this can be bad for the Co. That's completely dependent on the \"if\" tho...\n\nThe family retained a stake, so it's not like they completely cashed in and left the brand to it's new owners **ahem cough Fender** . They're still on the board and likely will have input at least on the guitar amplification side of things.\n\nBy way of explanation for that however Leo, forever a hypochondriac, believed that he was quite ill and possibly not long for this world when he had Don Randall negotiate the sale of Fender. But then it also fit Leo's personality. Whenever he was done with something he was done.\n\nHe never quit innovating which is how the world got Music Man gear and when his non-compete with CBS was over we eventually got G&L with all of it's advances on \"Fenderish\" designs but with a few of Leo's personal twists and even more innovations.\n\nLeo never rested on his laurels and kept innovating until the day he died whereas I believe the point being made here is that Marshall has for the most part stopped innovating and has become a fully matured product line. That's a sure way to become commercially extinct.\n\nBy way of explanation for that however Leo, forever a hypochondriac, believed that he was quite ill and possibly not long for this world when he had Don Randall negotiate the sale of Fender.

That's a sure way to become commercially extinct.\n\nYes, in a way, that's very Leo Fender. He continued being the visionary that he always was. I think he never anticipated (or maybe he didn't really care for) guitarists being traditionalists - that makes sense I suppose considering that his products were meant to go against the mindset to begin with!\n\nThe family retained a stake, so it's not like they completely cashed in and left the brand to it's new owners **ahem cough Fender** .\n\nIn addition, the Stathopoulos and Gretsch families all sold their companies (although Gretsch's grandson bought it back). If they didn't, the brands may not exist today.\n\nMarshall has for the most part stopped innovating and has become a fully matured product line. That's a sure way to become commercially extinct.\n\nBut, as you also wrote, guitar players don't want innovation. We're a weird bunch - give us something new, but make sure it looks and sounds like something old.\n\nYes, in a way, that's very Leo Fender. He continued being the visionary that he always was.

I think he never anticipated (or maybe he didn't really care for) guitarists being traditionalists - that makes sense I suppose considering that his products were meant to go against the mindset to begin with!\n\nLeo never learned to play the guitar so he depended on others early on to tell him what they liked and didn't like about his ideas and his designs. Once the basics of certain products were established he never departed from that much preferring to spend his efforts elsewhere.\n\nG&Ls instruments look much like Fenders. There are some subtle differences and a few newer body designs but for the most part the rest is the pickups, electronics, and hardware all what he believed to be improvements over his previous designs when he owned Fender.\n\nEven in his G&L days he never strayed from building players guitars and basses with bolt on necks and easily repairable and/or replaceable components. He was a bit like the Henry Ford of solid body guitars and simple yet effective amps designed not to distort easily.\n\nThat last part was where Jim Marshall came in.....LOL.\n\nBut, as you also wrote, guitar players don't want innovation. We're a weird bunch - give us something new, but make sure it looks and sounds like something old.\n\nPrecisely Davis although for certain genre players are more than willing to go out to the far edge of body design. But that aside the rest is all pretty much based on concepts and designs from the 40s and 50s.\n\nThere may come a day when players will demand a dramatic departure from more vintage designs but it hasn't come quite yet and every manufacturer keeps churning out what we've seen for over 70 years."
