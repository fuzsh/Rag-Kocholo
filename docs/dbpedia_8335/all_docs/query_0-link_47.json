Starting out as a small shop in London, Marshall has since conquered the music world, with countless guitarists using their gear.\n\nLegends like Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, Slash, and Jeff Beck are just a few names from a long list.\n\nOur comprehensive selection of Marshall equipment covers their combo amps, heads, cabinets, and accessories. It also includes rare and sought-after recreations of the famous Plexi and JTM45 heads.\n\nWhether you’re a beginner looking for your first combo amp or a seasoned pro in need of a new rig for your backline, our Marshall amplifier assortment has what you need. Even better, when you purchase your Marshall at Gear4music, you’ll enjoy our three-year warranty and 30-day money-back guarantee, along with lightning-fast delivery service.\n\nAbout Marshall Guitar Amps\n\nMarshall amps need no introduction. You'll no doubt have seen their famous logo and inimitable look emblazoned across many stages around the world. Having been around since 1961, their long and illustrious history now stretches over more than 60 years!\n\nThey're renowned for using valve (or tube) technology, meaning nearly every Marshall guitar amp, like the celebrated JVM210H 100W, has a warm, thick, organic tone which sounds absolutely huge. Their overdrive circuitry is worshipped by everything from blues bands to extreme metal bands - they sound spectacular. Filled with crunch, shimmering overtones, plenty of attack, and often multiple channels (clean, overdrive, ultra-gain), they can pack one thunderous punch. Marshall Amps' clean settings are also prolific, having a bell-like chime which can be moulded to the player's needs.\n\nOn the iconic gold-plated front panel of these beauties you'll find an array of satisfying, responsive controls. From three-band EQs for shaping the bass, midrange, and treble frequencies, to drive, reverb, channel switches and more, this innovative amp maker pays attention to the details. Some models, like the Marshall MG15GFX Gold 15W Combo, make use of more modern solid state technology too, meaning they're lighter and often have more built-in effects than their heavier valve counterparts.\n\nWhilst Marshall guitar amps' thunderous legacy is often talked about, this company has a blindingly bright future ahead of it too.\n\nMarshall Guitar Amps FAQs\n\nAre Marshall amps still good?\n\nMarshall amps are still considered to be some of the best and most reliable made today. Their valve technology may be old, but it still creates some of the most detailed, defined, and thick tones around. They are also robust and heavy-duty, meaning they are loved by gigging guitarists.\n\nWhat happened to Marshall amps?\n\nMarshall Guitar Amps are the same company they were over sixty years ago. They have, however, grown and expanded significantly since then, releasing many more models and series. They're also now owned by Zound Industries after being sold on by the Marshall family (they are still the largest stakeholder).\n\nWhat Marshall amp did Hendrix use?\n\nJimi Hendrix was known to use a number of different Marshall amps. The most notable models were the Marshall Super lead 100 watt, Marshall Super 100JH 'Plexi Head, and Marshall JTM45."
