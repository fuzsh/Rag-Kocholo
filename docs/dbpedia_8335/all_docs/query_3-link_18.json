        "text": "Marshall Group now partly owned by family\n\nMarshall Amplification has been acquired by Zound Industries and will now be known as the privately owned Marshall Group. The Marshall Family will own 24% of the newly formed group.\n\nMarshall Amplification\n\nToday the news was made official that the UK family-owned Marshall Amplification has been purchased by Zound Industries. They are the company that has worked with Marshall for the last 10 years, making Bluetooth speakers and headphones, etc\n\nIn addition to Marshall Amplification, the deal also includes Natal Drums, Marshall Records and the Marshall Live Agency.\n\nMarshall Family\n\nThankfully, the Marshall family retains 24% ownership of the newly formed Marshall Group and so their legacy carries on in safe hands.\n\n“With this game-changing deal, Marshall Group will become the main challenger in our industry and the most exciting alternative to traditional players, bringing even greater innovation and value to clients, employees, and investors alike.” – Henri de Bodinat, Chairman of Zound Industries\n\nThe Guv’nor\n\nJim Marshall founded the company with his son Terry in 1962 and the brand name has to be one of the biggest, most well-known in the history of rock.\n\nEveryone, knows Marshall amps, even if they don’t play the guitar and I bet just about everyone can recognise a Marshall stack!\n\nThis new move makes perfect sense and I can see the brand growing from strength to strength. The world of guitar amps has evolved in 60 years and so this could really help the Marshall brand stay relevant in modern music.\n\nFor example, the recent reissue of their classic pedal line is a good example of what we might get in the future.\n\nYour opinion\n\nWhere do you think the takeover will take us? Are you concerned about the future of the brand?\n\nMore Information\n\nMarshall\n\nInstagram\n\nPress release at Zound\n\nMore Marshall news\n\nYou are currently viewing a placeholder content from Facebook.
