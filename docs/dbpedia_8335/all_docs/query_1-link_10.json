        "text": "Today, Swedish audio, tech and design company Zound Industries is formally changing its name to Marshall Group following the announcement of the merger between Zound and Marshall Amplification earlier this spring.\n\nThe company claims that the move is much more than just a name change and represents the beginning of a new chapter in a decade-long partnership in which the iconic Marshall amplifier brand will be extended.\n\n“With the Marshall group, we’re turning the volume up to 11 with one of the world’s most iconic brands powered by one of the fastest growing, and profitable, companies in our industry. These are the perfect conditions to create the best products and experiences for musicians and music lovers around the world, and fuel profitable growth for years to come,” said Jeremy de Maillard, CEO, of Marshall Group.\n\nThe Marshall Group is now home to Marshall guitar amplifiers, speakers and headphones, Marshall Records, Marshall Live Agency, Marshall Studio, Natal Drums, Urbanears and adidas Headphones. The move brings together some 800 employees across eight locations globally and the new company will have an annual turnover of $360m.\n\nSince 2010, Zound Industries has brought the Marshall brand from the big stage to a global consumer audience of music lovers by exporting its headphones and speakers to more than 90 countries. With the formation of the Marshall Group, a new audio, tech and design company will unite musicians and music lovers with some genre-breaking technology.\n\n“We are set to continue our transformative growth journey by bringing great products to a global audience through cutting-edge audio innovation and culture-driven brand building. This is beyond exciting, and we are very grateful to have the trust of the Marshall family,” said Martin Axhamre, CFO & Deputy CEO, of Marshall Group, in a corporate press release.\n\nThe group’s head office will remain in Stockholm while the home of Marshall Amplification in Milton Keynes will continue to play a vital part in the group’s continuous journey and honoring the legacy of Marshall founder “The Father of Loud”, Jim Marshall."
