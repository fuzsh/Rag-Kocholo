        "text": "Change is always an opportunity. From what I understand, Zound is operating in a far bigger market with consumer electronics , than Marshall with its guitar amps (which is a turnover of 42.000.000 GBP for them, from what I read. I guess, Zound is making more with license business)\n\nTherefore the question is, whether Zound has any interest in pumping money into R&D for guitar amps, when they clearly can make much more money with consumer stuff.\n\nI don't think they will change much in Marshall guitar amp production. We may see a shift of production of cabinets and JVM series to the Vietnam factory which seems to be an obvious choice in my view.\n\nBut maybe they wanna push into the guitar market a little more. I can see Hot Rod Plexi models a l√° Friedman , attenuators, amps with IR loading and other modern features, an updated digital platform for high end modelling of classic Marshall amps or even amps like the Tonemaster series from Marshall (I would be tempted by looks alone...).\n\nMaybe they even may try to bring products to the market, which may bridge the gap from consumer to musician and therefore creating more customers for guitar amps.\n\nSeeing what Marshall did in the last decades, they seemed to be too slow. The Studio Series came out, while the whole world was demanding small Marshall heads for years and everyone had them already available, when Marshall finally got them out.\n\nSame with the Jubilee.\n\nAnd what is it with the Signature amps like AFD and YJM ? The latter would still sell like hotcakes, if they would produce it, even without the YJM signature. Same for hot rodded Plexis/JCM 800's, everyone and their uncle made these for decades, but Marshall.\n\nWhat about the 1W series? If they would have shift production of these to their Vietnam factory and sell them at a lower price, those would sell, more so now, than ever before.\n\nBut they did the Astoria series, which must have been a massive money pit . Boutique amps at a price, noone would pay for a modern Marshall, with sounds and options just not good enough for the price point and the marketing for these was - eh - interesting\n\nSo, I'll cross my fingers that we may see a line of cool products coming from Marshall. And maybe in a year, they could buy Celestion, too. Would be cool imho )"
