        "text": "Marshall Amplification has purchased Eden Electronics from U.S. Music Corp. Eden, who specializes in high-end bass amplification, will still be distributed in the States by U.S. Music Corp, so North American customers “will not impacted.”\n\nIn a joint press release, both Marshall and U.S. Music Corp stated that the sale would result in more resources being poured into Eden.\n\n“We feel that Eden is a great strategic fit within our Marshall Amplifier line and therefore we have the opportunity to increase the Eden brand’s presence worldwide,” said Jonathan Ellery, Managing Director of Marshall. “We are prepared to invest in the development of new products and to expand the awareness of the brand.”\n\nEden will retain their staff, which will be managed by Marshall’s Luke Green.\n\n“I am very excited about the opportunity to guide the growth and development of one of the best brands in the music industry,” he stated. “The current Eden team will continue to be part of the company. With the resources that the Marshall Group will be able to offer we plan to really take Eden forward and continue to develop exciting new equipment for bass players.”\n\nEden was originally formed in 1976 by David Nordschow and was purchased by U.S. Music Corp in 2002. Nordschow has since left to create his own brand, David Nordschow Amplification."
