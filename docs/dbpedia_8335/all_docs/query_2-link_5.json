        "text": "More than 60 years ago, Jim Marshall began building the guitar amplifiers that bore his name and became a familiar sight on some of the most prestigious stages in the world. Founded with his son Terry, Marshall created the audio backdrop for some of the biggest names in rock’n’roll. The company’s amplifiers were the muscle behind the electric guitars of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, The Who and Oasis. It’s no exaggeration to say that the classic Marshall logo script is probably one of the world’s most exciting music brands.\n\nIn 2010, Marshall Amplification signed a long-term licensing deal with Swedish tech company Zound Industries. The arrangement took the Marshall brand to an entirely new market with a range of headphones and speakers built on the musical heritage of the original Marshall brand. Through innovative product development and retaining that classic Marshall amplifier look and sound, Marshall Headphones became one of the most exciting consumer electronics brands.\n\nThe partnership has been so successful the two companies have now decided to join forces with the launch of the Marshall Group. The ground-breaking deal combines the Milton Keynes-based Marshall Amplification with the Stockholm-headquartered Zound Industries in one company with annual revenues of $360m.\n\nThe deal has been driven by the phenomenal growth of Zound Industries and its success in bringing the Marshall brand to a new global consumer audience. The innovative range of wireless headphones and Bluetooth speakers is now sold in more than 90 countries and projects an attitude consumers love. The growing synergy between the two companies led to the fusion of the amplifier and consumer audio business under the umbrella of one of Sweden’s most profitable tech companies.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Zound Industries will acquire the business of Marshall Amplification for an undisclosed amount made up of a combination of cash and shares. The Marshall family will become the largest shareholder of the newly formed group. The deal covers all the Marshall Amplification brands and subsidiaries, including Natal Drums, Marshall Records and Marshall Live Agency.\n\nThe deal creates a group with double-digit profitability. Currently, Marshall Amplification employs 200 people at its Milton Keynes HQ and a further 300 at a Vietnamese manufacturing facility. Meanwhile, Zound has around 280 employees working at its Stockholm HQ.\n\nJim Marshall, known as “The Father of Loud,” founded Marshall Amplification in the 1960s with his son Terry. Victoria Marshall and her brother Terry continued the company after Jim died in 2012. Terry Marshall had worked with his father from the earliest days, and the family involvement continues with Jim’s grandchildren Joanne Marshall-Price, Paul Marshall and the Marshall Charitable Trust. The family will play a vital role in the new group, ensuring the Marshall sound and the brand’s legacy continues. Terry and Victoria Marshall will be joining the board of the Marshall Group.\n\nThe partnership between the two companies must be one of the most harmonious and successful licensing deals in the consumer electronics sector. The arrangement has been ongoing for 12 years and is fuelled by a shared passion for high-quality sound and great music. The speakers and headphones created by Zound Industries and bearing the famous Marshall logo are designed to last and bring pleasure to music lovers, just like Marshall amplifiers.\n\nHenri de Bodinat will chair the Marshall Group. He said: “With this game-changing deal, Marshall Group will become the main challenger in our industry and the most exciting alternative to traditional players, bringing even greater innovation and value to clients, employees, and investors alike.”\n\nTerry Marshall added: “Since my father and I created the original Marshall amp in 1962, we have always sought ways to deliver the pioneering Marshall sound to music lovers of all backgrounds and musical tastes worldwide. I’m confident that Marshall Group will elevate this mission and spur the love for the Marshall brand.”\n\nTerry’s sister Victoria continued: “With Marshall Group, the potential to further impact an ever-modernizing music industry is a highly genuine one. Together, we will preserve the Marshall legacy and shape the future of ‘Live Loud’. Having worked alongside my father during his later years, I know he would be excited at this direction and the potential to reach a larger worldwide audience with innovation and passion, which he always had in spades.”\n\nThe deal arose because of the close relationship between one of Sweden’s leading tech entrepreneurs, Konrad Bergström. As founder and board member of Zound Industries until 2018 and a member of Jim Marshall’s Board of Trustees since 2015, Bergström was instrumental in bringing together Zound Industries and Marshall Amplification. He will remain an advisor to the group.\n\n“I am proud that this deal has finally been completed,” said Konrad Bergström. “The success that we have achieved with the Marshall brand over recent years is soon going to be seen as having been the warm-up to a new British-Swedish headline act that is going to shake the tech and music industries to their foundations. Spinal Tap features one of cinema’s most iconic scenes when Nigel shows off how his Marshall guitar amplifier can turn ‘up to eleven’, but what we are announcing today is no parody: Marshall Group is going to go beyond established rules and limits and define a new sonic lifestyle category. We are going to Live Loud!”\n\nMarshall Group intends to leverage Zound Industries’ experience in design and branding to build on Marshall Amplification’s heritage and reputation as the music industry’s amplifiers of choice for over 60 years. Marshall Group says it will benefit from a holistic strategy and global business operations to boost revenue growth and profitability momentum.\n\nYesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to Jeremy de Maillard, the French CEO of the new group. It was the first time we’d met since I interviewed him for Forbes in July 2022. Speaking from his office in Stockholm, I asked de Maillard what the two companies could offer each other since they serve different markets.\n\n“That’s a good question. It’s important to remember that we are building on a successful partnership that’s been running for more than a decade. Zound Industries has brought the Marshall DNA and the brand's legacy – with its speakers and headphones – to 90 countries. We’ve set the standard for stylish and high-quality personal audio. And when we think of bringing the two companies together, this is about raising the standards of great sound in designs built to last.\n\n“Historically, Zound has focused on making products for listening to music and Marshall has made products for creating music. However, we both share a passion for high-quality sound and design. The characteristics of the products are very similar even though we come from different spaces. We’re very complementary to each other and this deal will enable us to bring together the full range of products and the entire consumer experience under one roof. It will allow us to be quicker with innovation and to have a deeper and more holistic connection with musicians and music lovers.”\n\n“Our relationship is built on trust and the Marshall family is just amazing. They genuinely care about the name, and they care about the legacy and want to make sure the brand is in good hands. We are so pleased to have been entrusted with it.\n\n“Our two companies have always pushed each other to be better. We’ve pushed each other out of our comfort zones, but always with an eye and respect for the Marshall DNA and its legacy. We both care deeply about the brand and what it means. We push each other to create the best possible products and interesting marketing campaigns. There has been a magic formula from our collaboration over the past 12 years.”\n\nI wanted to know how de Maillard envisaged Zound Industries extending the Marshall brand into untapped markets.\n\n“I think it is still too early to say, but the brand's potential is limitless because it stands for the rock’n’roll attitude transcending all musical genres. The brand embodies this, making it unique in the marketplace.”\n\n“Over the past 12 years, we’ve created some fantastic products that have turned Marshall into the symbol of loud for many generations. If you walk into someone's home and they have a Marshall speaker on the shelf, it immediately becomes a conversation piece. You end up talking for the whole evening about music, the live gigs you’ve been to, and the musicians you like.\n\n“If you wear a pair of Marshall headphones in the street, it says something about you to the rest of the world; it’s a statement. We see it as the number one alternative to traditional audio brands. It’s a brand with a huge personality and we believe it’s unique. We can see it in the numbers over the past two years. We’re growing market share, most of which comes from the Marshall products in our business. The deal is the organic next chapter in our relationship with the brand.\n\n“Combining our strengths and unique positioning as the Marshall Group will fuel our ambition to create premium, innovative products and experiences for musicians and music lovers worldwide. Zound has proven itself as a global, fast-growing, and progressive company. With the Marshall Group, we are set to accelerate our profitable growth in a $100bn market.”\n\nZound Industries has delivered two consecutive years of profitable growth. In 2022, net sales rose 44%, breaking the $300m barrier and achieving double-digit profitability with an operating margin of 10.3%, equivalent to an operating profit of $30m.\n\nTommy Jacobson is a founder of Zenith and a long-time investor. He was the largest shareholder of Zound Industries before the deal. Jacobsen said: “For me, this is a dream come true. Zenith has backed Zound Industries since 2010 because we buy into the company’s vision for the future of premium audio technology. This deal delivers against that foresight – it will create additional value for investors and establish a solid platform for future growth.”"
