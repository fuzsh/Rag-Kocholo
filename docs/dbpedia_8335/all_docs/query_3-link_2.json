        "text": "I manage a small store in southern Illinois, and called my guy at US Music today to ask about getting the ball rolling on becoming a Marshall dealer, only to find out that apparently the line is now going to be handled by someone else. I called my friend whose store is a dealer and he said he has the same questions because he's not been advised who they will be dealing with either. I've emailed Marshall via their website contact but haven't heard anything back from them yet. Thanks in advance to anyone who might know and help me out.\n\n\"US Music\"?\n\nMarshall USA is a division of Exertis/JAM and has been Marshall's US distributor for a long time.\n\nMusical Instruments - Exertis | Jam Industries\n\nWhether it’s rock, classical or techno we’re truly excited about the whole wide world of musical instruments. Click now for more.\n\nIn 2010, Zound Industries of Sweden licensed Marshall's trademarks for a line of Marshall-branded headphones and Bluetooth hifi speakers. Zound has their own distribution system in over 100 countries (including the US) for Marshall hifi and Zounds' other brands. (Distributing to retailers like Target, Crutchfield, BestBuy, etc.)\n\nLast year, Zound bought Marshall Amplification and the merged companies changed their names to \"The Marshall Group\".\n\nExertis/JAM's contract was with Marshall Amplification UK. MAUK no longer exists, so Exertis/JAM's contract may have been voided.\n\n-------------------------\n\nUS distribution is in limbo. The Marshall Group may be planning to use Zound's distribution network, expanding it to service instrument retailers. Or they may be negotiating new terms with Exertis/JAM (or talking to other US musical instrument distributors).\n\nMany retailers have dropped prices on existing Marshall stock and are showing backorders or \"out of stock\" on many items. Distribution contracts are proprietary and confidential so no one knows exactly what's going on. Marshall retailers may be contractually bound to not buy from another distributor until they fully pay off Exertis/JAM (it's common for distributors to \"front\" products with payment plans, so the retailer doesn't pay until they sell the product). Or Exertis/JAM may be taking legal action to keep the contract in force.\n\nSince Zound Industries had an existing US network it would seem to make sense for them to eliminate middlemen and take over amplifier distribution. They have a network and experience but it would take time to expand to instrument retailers.\n\n-------------------------\n\nBottom line is that no one outside of The Marshall Group and Exertis/JAM knows exactly what's going with US distribution or what the future holds.\n\nUK products are generally more expensive in the US than the UK or EU. Part of that is shipping and legislative, but in the past few years US Marshall prices jumped a lot higher than other UK brands like Vox and Celestion. It's likely that a big part of that was Exertis/JAM lining their pockets (possibly had foreknowledge of the Zound/Marshall merger). We can hope that when it all shakes out Marshall's US prices will be more in line with other UK products.\n\nUS Music is tied with JAM/Exertis in some way, they are the rep that used to cover my area. KMC is also part of JAM/Exertis, which is how KMC ended up distributing the Marshall MG series stuff, and then they were handling closing out the Origin and Code stuff as well during the last quarter of last year. My guy from US music who used to be the rep has no idea what's going on at this point, I talked to him today, and my friend in another part of the country who had already been a dealer told me that he talked to his US Music rep and they told him the same as mine told me, so I'm not sure that Exertis/Jam guys actually know what's up at this point. I suspect you're correct that Zound will likely take over distribution. I'm just sort of surprised that since NAMM was last weekend that there hasn't been any sort of announcement regarding the line and it's distribution. I would have thought they would have had something worked out and announced it during NAMM because that would have made sense from the MI industry point of view.\n\nUS distribution is in limbo.\n\nNah, it's safe and Zound.... [I had to sneak that one in].\n\nI would have thought they would have had something worked out and announced it during NAMM because that would have made sense from the MI industry point of view.\n\nUnlikely; the regular customers don't care as long as they can buy it from their dealer of choice. It's not an effective way of communicating b2b either. I'd give (former) HQ a call:\n\nhttps://marshall.com/about/contact-us (+44(0)1908 375411)\n\nIn my experience, they're not very good at answering emails and certainly not timely. Failing that, reach out to Zound:\n\nI got an email from our new rep this afternoon, he wants to touch base next week and said that they should have dealer agreements and new pricing ready to go by the end of the month if not a day or two earlier. Sounds like they are ramping things up.\n\nThanks for your valuable input. I was about to buy the JVM410H yesterday but they're out of stock in Musiciansfriend/GC, Samash and Sweetwater. Guitar Center told me that they're not receiving it any more??? Tha'ts right,,,he said \"anymore? So my questions are: will the JVM410H discontinued? or to be changed or upgraded to another model?? Also, when you said \"they are ramping things up\", are you referring to increasing the JVM410H prices in the event that it becomes available (in stock) again? I don't know what to do: either wait for some news about the JVM410H future or buying one in Reverb before this product becomes discontinued forever and ever. Dilemma!"
