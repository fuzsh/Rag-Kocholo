        "text": "Lee Jackson is the founder and CEO of Metaltronix, a visionary in the music industry renowned for crafting signature sounds for some of the biggest names and contributing to the iconic guitar tones of the 80s & 90s. With a prolific career that includes shaping the audio landscapes of albums like “Under Lock n Key” (Dokken), “Invasion of your Privacy” (Ratt), “Eat Em and Smile” (David Lee Roth), and “No Rest for the Wicked” (Ozzy Osbourne), Lee has left an indelible mark on the industry.\n\nLee’s entrepreneurial spirit led him to establish his own companies, including Metaltronix, Perfect Connection, and Lee Jackson Designs. His expertise extended to collaborations with esteemed companies such as BC Rich Guitars, Paul Rivera, Pignose, Oberheim, Fender, Crate, and Ampeg. Through these collaborations, Lee played a pivotal role in creating industry standards in sound.\n\nHailing from Southern California, Lee’s upbringing was immersed in music. His parents owned a record store reminiscent of the one in Hairspray, playing classic tunes from the ’50s and ’60s. Introduced to the sounds of the sixties by his two older sisters and inspired by his father’s passion for electronics, Lee’s journey into music and technology began.\n\nBeyond his role as a musician and entrepreneur, Lee Jackson’s legacy is etched in the very fabric of the music industry, influencing generations with his innovative approach to sound and technology.\n\nLatest News:\n\nMetaltronix M-2000 v2 Head\n\nThe New Metaltronix M-2000 v2 is now available to purchase. They are in stock, Lee did a special Collectors Edition run of 10, They are extremely special, and will not be made again.\n\nMetallica Metaltronix M-1000\n\nCheck out interview with James Hetfield talking about the new Album.\n\nWe have been told that they used the M-1000 on 4 songs.\n\nAnd used Lee’s Ampeg VL-1002 heads also.\n\nCUSTOM AMP MODIFICATION\n\nWe get asked every week if Lee still does personal amplifier Modifications and the answer is yes.

This is one of the most insanely useful pedals I’ve ever encountered – it essentially adds warmth and top end to the sound, all in a unified way, revealing what is coming from the guitar without ever feeling overly hyped. I am so fond of this pedal because it highlights and brings forth so much of what I love about the electric guitar, namely overtones and a wide dynamic range. Regardless of what amp I use the BIG with, it seems to function almost like the mastering stage of an album – it is subtle and instantly musical, and when its not there, you sure miss it!” – Julian Lage\n\nTONETALK\n\nI had a blast on Tonetalk, I am glad they invited me on. It was great talking about the 80’s and the bands I was involved with.
