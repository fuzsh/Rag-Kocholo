        "text": "Marshall is an industry leader providing genre-defining amps that are recognised and played around the world.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, Marshall amps have been popularised by trailblazing guitarists like Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page. Originally revered around the world for their rich distorted tones, Marshall are the go-to brand for crunchy-sounding amps, popular among rock and metal players - and remain so to this day. But now Marshall also offers much more, including pedals, cabinets, support and advice, for players of any style and any era.\n\nThe team at Marshall is proud of their history though they're only just getting started. From making a new type of amplifier in the back of a store in 1962, to providing a huge range of musicians with all the tools they need to create in 2022. It’s been a loud 60 years but music is still at the heart of everything they do. Here’s to many, many more.\n\nfind a course"
