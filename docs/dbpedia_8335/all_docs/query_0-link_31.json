        "text": "Named for locations in London that are significant to the history of Marshall Amplification, Marshall Headphones has produced a range of portable music speakers with high quality audio reproduction and the classic look of Marshall amps.\n\nShrouded in darkness, this fourth addition to the cult Stanmore range casts an ominous shadow. Its blacked out look oozes brooding style. Small in size, but not in sound, the Stanmore Pitch Black is a compact active stereo music speaker that yields clean and precise audio reproduction, even at the highest levels.\n\nThe classic Stanmore look pays homage to the history and heritage of vintage Marshall amplifiers, and the legendary music they inspired. Just like those amplifiers, the Stanmore’s tactile analogue controls allow you to dial in your audio settings.\n\nAlready available in three classic colors, Black, Cream and Brown, with vintage-looking Marshall fret and the iconic Marshall script logo, the Stanmore Pitch Black moves Marshall’s history of big stage performance out of the arena and into your personal space.\n\nAvailable now at your local dealer and marshallamps.com, Stanmore is supplied with a double ended 3.5mm coiled audio lead and features Bluetooth connectivity. The Stanmore’s clear, accurate sound is produced by a 5 ¼” woofer and two ¾” dome tweeters.\n\nMarshall Amplification is distributed in the USA by US Music Corp. US Music Corp, located in Buffalo Grove, Illinois is an international musical instrument company that manufactures and distributes products worldwide under the Washburn, Parker, Randall, and Oscar Schmidt brand names, as well as being the exclusive US distributor for Marshall, Eden, Natal, Hagstrom, Warwick, Framus, Quik Lok and DigiTech. US Music is a subsidiary of Jam Industries, Ltd."
