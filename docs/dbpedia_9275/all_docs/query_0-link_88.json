        "text": "Volume 10, January 16, 2014 for the WSL Updates mailing list Topics include: 1) 2014 TEEN VIDEO CHALLENGE 2) YOUTH PROGRAM AWARD 3) HUMANITIES WASHINGTON PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES 4) JOHN COTTON DANA AWARD 5) RECOGNIZING OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS 6) FREE CE OPPORTUNITIES NEXT WEEK --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) 2014 TEEN VIDEO CHALLENGE Washington State will participate in the 2014 Teen Video Challenge, a national video competition for teens to get involved with reading and their public library’s summer reading program. As part of the Collaborative Summer Library Program (CSLP), teens across the country are invited to create a 30 to 90 second video with their unique interpretation of the 2014 teen slogan, “Spark a Reaction,” in combination with reading and libraries. The idea is to involve teens in summer reading, before and during the summer months, by being part of the process. This is an opportunity for teens to showcase their creativity and have their ideas heard before a national audience. CSLP will award $275 to one Washington 2014 Teen Video Challenge winner or winning team. The library listed on the entry form will receive prizes worth $125 from CSLP and Upstart. All of the state winning videos will be posted on the 2014 Winners page of the CSLP website and will be available for libraries in Washington and nationwide to promote the 2014 reading program. All submissions must be received by Friday, March 7, 2014. For details about the Washington State CSLP 2014 Teen Video Challenge and to find out how to enter, please visit sos.wa.gov/q/teenvideo. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2) YOUTH PROGRAM AWARD Does your library or museum have an outstanding afterschool or out-of-school program that is transforming the lives of young people? The National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award (NAHYP) recognizes twelve such programs each year with $10,000 and an award ceremony at the White House. The NAHYP Award is a signature initiative of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Winning programs exemplify how arts and humanities programs outside of the school day enrich the lives of young people by teaching new skills, nurturing creativity, and building self-confidence. The deadline for applications is Monday, February 10, 2014. For more information, visit nahyp.org. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) HUMANITIES WASHINGTON PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES Humanities Washington is a private nonprofit organization that is dedicated to sparking conversation and critical thinking, using story as a catalyst, to nurture thoughtful and engaged communities across our state. At the next First Tuesdays, Zaki Abdelhamid, who is involved with this organization’s special initiatives, will discuss four resources that can provide libraries with important opportunities to generate new audiences, enhance their own adult programs, and engage a diverse group of participants in discussions about ideas that affect our lives in the state:\n\nThe speakers bureau;\n\nThe grants program;\n\nThe poet laureate program;\n\nThe new family reading program.\n\nDesigned as a continuing education opportunity for staff of libraries in Washington State, this free web presentation, which will take place on February 4, 2014, from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. PST, lets attendees share their skills and successes and learn about new topics. Sessions are recorded so that others may listen at their own convenience. For more information about First Tuesdays, visit sos.wa.gov/q/tuesdays. For instructions on joining the presentation, visit sos.wa.gov/q/FirstTuesdays. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4) JOHN COTTON DANA AWARD The American Library Association (ALA) is accepting submissions for the John Cotton Dana Award (JCD).

JCD submissions include strategic library communication campaigns from all sizes and types of libraries.
