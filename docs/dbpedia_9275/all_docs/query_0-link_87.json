Unable to find an appropriate Latin phrase, he authored this English one instead, which eventually became the college motto (see The New York Times Book Review, 5 Mar 1967). The university motto has since been shortened to Semper Discens (\"Always Learning\").\n\nSometimes attributed to Richard Henry Dann."
