We must come down from our heights, and leave our straight paths for the by-ways and low places of life, if we would learn truths by strong contrasts; and in hovels, in forecastles, and among our own outcasts in foreign lands, see what has been wrought among our fellow-creatures by accident, hardship, or vice.', 'Those who teach, must never cease to learn', and 'The public library is a center of public happiness first, of public education next.'",

To the great mass of the people it comes as their first and only educational opportunity.”\n\n― John Cotton Dana, A Library Primer\n\n“Art should be studied, not worshipped. Artworks should be preserved that they may help us, not that they may amaze and confound us. Above all, we should study them with the purpose of learning from them.”\n\n― John Cotton Dana"
