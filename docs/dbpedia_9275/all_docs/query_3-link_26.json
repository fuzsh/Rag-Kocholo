        "text": "Applications are open for the 2024 John Cotton Dana Award (JCD), one of the most prestigious awards given to libraries for outstanding library public relations. Up to eight $10,000 awards will be provided by the H.W. Wilson Foundation. The deadline to apply is May 10.\n\nLibraries of all types and sizes are encouraged to submit entries for a JCD Award. Entries may be submitted by any library, Friends group, consulting agency, or service provider, unless they are represented on the JCD committee.\n\nEntries should highlight a strategic communications campaign from the past year, as opposed to an individual piece of promotion. Examples of past campaigns have included rebranding efforts, promotion of archives and special collections, awareness campaigns, community partnerships, and special events. Entries highlighting innovation in marketing and new technologies while sharing what it is you set out to achieve combine all the successful components of winning campaigns.\n\nSubmission documentation is expected to show the scope and effectiveness of the campaign. Entries for the John Cotton Dana Award are organized around needs assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation. Examples of these documents may include initial assessments and research, processes for implementation, goals met, creative output, media releases, media coverage and other metrics that establish results. Up to eight winners will be selected with at least one chosen winner from the following annual library operating budget categories:\n\nUnder $1 Million\n\n$1M – $5M\n\n$5M – $10M\n\n$10M – $15M\n\nGreater than $15M\n\nView application details (PDF)\n\nView the evaluation criteria (PDF)"
