        "text": "Chattanooga Public Library is one of this year’s recipients of the John Cotton Dana Award from the American Library Association and EBSCO Information Services for outstanding library public relations.\n\nThe award recognizes CPL’s successful awareness campaign “Here We Grow”, which launched February 2021 and helped the library bring in 143 percent new patrons in 2021 (compared to 2020). Representatives from CPL will be presented with the award at the ALA Annual Conference on June 26 in Washington, D.C. A grant of $10,000 from The H.W. Wilson Foundation will also be given to CPL.\n\n“This award is the highest honor in the U.S. for library public relations and marketing,” said Christina Sacco, CPL’s Public Relations coordinator. “When I first joined the library, I set my sights on that award, but I didn’t dream of achieving it with our first marketing campaign. I think our win is a testament to the quality of the videos and billboards Humanaut produced, as well as the quality of our programs and services.”\n\nLibrary Director Corinne Hill said, “I’m proud of our Public Relations department for their creation, planning and implementation of a successful campaign. Our library has been a leader in the industry for our services and programs, so I’m thrilled that we are also leading the way for library marketing.”"
