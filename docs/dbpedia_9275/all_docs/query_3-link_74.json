        "text": "24 January 2023\n\nThe American Library Association (ALA) is now accepting submissions for the 2023 John Cotton Dana Award (JCD). The John Cotton Dana Award is one of the most prestigious awards given to up to eight libraries. The $10,000 awards will be provided by the H.W. Wilson Foundation and honors outstanding library public relations.\n\nLibraries of all types and sizes are encouraged to submit entries for a John Cotton Dana Award. Entries may be submitted by any library, Friends group, consulting agency or service provider, unless they are represented on the JCD committee.\n\nEntries should highlight a strategic communications campaign from the past year. Examples of past campaigns have included rebranding efforts, promotion of archives and special collections, awareness campaigns, community partnerships and special events. Entries highlighting innovation in marketing and new technologies while sharing what it is you set out to achieve combine all the successful components of winning campaigns.\n\nSubmission documentation is expected to show the scope and effectiveness of the campaign. Entries for the John Cotton Dana Award are organized around needs assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation. Examples of these documents may include initial assessments and research, processes for implementation, goals met, creative output, media releases, media coverage and other metrics that establish results. Up to eight winners will be selected with at least one chosen winner from the following annual library operating budget categories:\n\nUnder $1 Million\n\n$1M - $5M\n\n$5M - $10M\n\n$10M - $15M\n\nGreater than $15M\n\nThe awards are managed by Core: Leadership, Infrastructure, Futures (Core), a division of ALA. All John Cotton Dana Award judges are associated with the Core division."
