        "text": "Museums and elites\n\nEuropean and North American museums have their roots in elite personal collections, which were housed in private spaces and open only to a restricted circle of friends and acquaintances, or those with proper letters of presentation—almost always wealthy, educated men. Although the range of visitors broadened somewhat with the founding of public museums in the eighteenth century, these remained exclusive and unwelcoming to most people.\n\nThe British Museum, for example—founded in 1753 as a gift to the nation to be “visited and seen by all persons desirous of seeing and viewing [it]”[1]—required until 1810 that applications for a ticket be submitted in advance, in writing. A punchy guide to London lamented that “idle girls, or … , still worse, idle men and women, may go and admire, for a few minutes… [but] the image[s seen] will soon be effaced from their minds, their understandings being as much darkened as their memories unretentive.”[2] Museums did little in the way of labeling or interpretation to help, and this impression of visitors too unprepared and too unintelligent to benefit from a museum’s collections prevailed.\n\nIronically, many public museums were founded with the intention of countering those perceived shortcomings—that is, to raise levels of general education and culture in support of an informed, engaged citizenry. In France, for instance, the Louvre laid out a clear message of national identity tied to cultural heritage: the distinctiveness of French art, its place in the larger artistic patrimony of mankind, and so forth. However, the space of the museum remained—and remains still to some degree today—mainly the realm of the elite.\n\nThe market as a driver of change\n\nIn nineteenth-century Britain, much of the concern around who could and should visit museums centered on economic and class issues, as the Industrial Revolution radically transformed the nature of work and, by extension, urban and social structures. British industrialists felt pressured by goods imported in bulk from the colonies (Indian cotton, for example), and by manufacturing innovations in rival European nations (especially France) that threatened to displace their own products. One solution was to give their citizen-laborers better access to imported goods so that they could study, imitate, and ultimately challenge them. At the same time, lush displays of goods would stimulate consumer appetites, boosting demand and thus also production.\n\nOut of these ambitions was born the first international trade fair, London’s Great Exhibition, held in 1851 in the newly built Crystal Palace (above). This massive structure of iron and glass was itself a marvel, at the time the largest enclosed space in the world, housing over 100,000 exhibitions. Displays were divided by geography (nations and colonies) and technologies, and organizers sought to balance spectacle and wonder with an educational agenda. Notably, their target audiences included the artisans and craftsmen who had been excluded from elite museums but who enthusiastically joined the throngs at the Exhibition.\n\nUntil this time, museums had not paid much attention to design; it was assumed that educated visitors would stay engaged through their inherent interest in the objects themselves. But at this giant trade fair, great care was given to installation, drawing attention to the workmanship, materials, and beauty of the objects on display, be they unfinished goods like textiles or finely crafted items for the home. Visitors were encouraged to look carefully, but not touch. Explanatory materials were plentiful, including written labels, attendants who demonstrated the machinery, and public lectures. Writer Henry Mayhew described the Crystal Palace as a giant schoolhouse—a far cry from the impenetrable museums of the day.\n\nBeyond didactic learning about materials and technologies, organizers hoped their exhibitions would have a “civilizing” effect. Thus the Crystal Palace also presented “fine arts,” including sculpture, stained glass, and other objects “illustrative of the taste and skill displayed in the applications of human industry.”[3]\n\nThe hierarchy that distinguished “art” as being of the highest taste and skill implied a social hierarchy as well, allying this elevated category of production with those elites who could study, appreciate, and collect it. And yet even while the Crystal Palace seemed to reinforce social distinctions, it also pushed against them. For unlike the British Museum and its kin, the Great Exhibition was affordable to many. It was a place where the laborer and the lord literally rubbed elbows, as illustrated in this satirical image where the Duke of Wellington is astounded to encounter a working class family at the fair."
