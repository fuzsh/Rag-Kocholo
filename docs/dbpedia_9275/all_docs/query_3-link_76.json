        "text": "The Library Leadership and Management Association (LLAMA) sponsored a panel Saturday morning on outstanding community-centered marketing campaigns. “John Cotton Dana Winners Tell All!” brought together experts from libraries that won the LLAMA John Cotton Dana Award to share their secrets about successful library PR and advocacy campaigns.\n\nToni Tucker, assistant to the dean of Illinois State University Libraries for grant writing, spoke about her 2007 project to celebrate the 150th birthday of Ange Milner, who served as ISU’s first librarian from 1890 to her death in 1928. Tucker’s biggest problem was overcoming Milner’s reputation as a ghost that haunts the old library building, rather than as an innovative professional who wrote 80 articles and two books on information literacy long before the term was coined. She came up with the idea of providing a headstone for Milner, who had been buried in an unmarked grave in a Normal, Illinois, cemetery. The publicity surrounding the event led to both the mayor of Normal and the governor of Illinois proclaiming April 10, 2006, “Ange Milner Day,” and an altered perception of Milner as much more than a ghost.\n\nLori Coryell, assistant director of Ypsilanti (Mich.) District Library, described her library’s successful efforts in promoting the annual Ypsilanti Songwriting Festival in 2008, a day-long event that brings local and national songwriters together for musical creativity. Coryell decided to have a local graphics company that designs logos for music groups come up with a festival logo that she used for flyers, posters, stickers, t-shirts, print ads, and websites in a promotional campaign that only cost $2,013, but resulted in a 13% increase in festival participation over the previous year and increased music CD circulation in the library.\n\nNancy Dowd, director of marketing for the New Jersey State Library, described the statewide 2009 campaign that allowed local libraries in New Jersey to tell strategic stories about how libraries transform lives. Some 240 libraries across the state partnered in the effort, which was responsible for raising the awareness of legislators enough for them to reinstate library funding that had been zeroed out in 2010. One of the features was a “New Jersey Libraries Transform Lives” at turnpike toll booths across the state. The total cost of the campaign was $54,000, but this included three months of advocacy commercials on New Jersey public television.\n\nDowd encouraged everyone with an innovative campaign to apply for the John Cotton Dana Award, which has been given since 1946. “You can do this!” she urged. “$5,000 and it’s such a great award.” The award is sponsored by the H. W. Wilson Company and LLAMA."
