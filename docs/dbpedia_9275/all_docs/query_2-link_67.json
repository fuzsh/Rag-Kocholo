        "text": "The Christ Church Grammar School is located in Perth, Western Australia where the school’s main campus overlooks Fresh water Bay on the Swan River. This gorgeous campus sits on over 40 acres of property and is one of the most prestigious all boys’ schools in the area.\n\nWe are always excited for the opportunity to work on educational facilities because it gives us an opportunity to inspire creativity and bring a new look to such an important place for growth. With Architecture Studio chose our most iridescent color, Peacock Bright to add color and excitement to this campus. The stamped tiles were installed in key areas around the school in a unique vertical format. As students walk throughout campus, they can see the colors changing right in front of their eyes.\n\nInvesting in education is one of the most important things we can do as a community. The youth are tomorrow’s future and giving them an exciting and cutting-edge learning facility is setting up children for success.\n\nProject Details\n\nArchitect: With_Architecture Studio\n\nProduct: Large Cupped Tile\n\nMaterial: 304 Stainless Steel – LIC\n\nColor/Finish: LIC Peacock Bright"
