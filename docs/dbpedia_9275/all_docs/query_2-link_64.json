        "text": "What was your “My Modern Library” campaign? What was the campaign’s goal? How did you approach the challenges? Any big surprises/lessons learned?\n\nWe launched the “My Modern Library” campaign in 2016 with the goal of increasing library cardholders and circulation (particularly digital circulation) among millennials.\n\nEach month, we highlighted a different digital service, including e-books, music streaming, Audiobooks, etc. We crafted friendly, consumer-focused messaging and paired it with bright and modern imagery, to give the library a modern and positive brand.\n\nWe also created an automated email onboarding campaign that educates new patrons on library services. Once someone signs up for a library card, they automatically get a series of 11 emails designed to educate and engage them when they’re most interested in learning about the library (e.g., right after they register).\n\nWe capped off the campaign with a unique promotion for National Library Card Sign-Up Month, called the “Book Brain Challenge.”\n\nThe promotion asked patrons to film themselves doing something fun with a book on their head, post it to social media, tag three friends to do the same, and then ask people to sign-up for library cards.\n\nThe campaign was easy to do (almost everyone has at least one book lying around the house), was appropriate for all ages, had a clear call to action (e.g., “Sign up for a library card”), was trackable, and allowed patrons to get creative and have fun — all for the sake of supporting the local library system.\n\nThe campaign engaged hundreds of people, including local business leaders and elected officials, who did everything from Tai Chi, to riding horses, to dancing, to meditating, and more — there was an incredible amount of creativity and library pride! You can view some of the videos on WCLS’s YouTube channel.\n\nThe campaign was successful from an engagement standpoint (during the campaign, Facebook reported more than 86,000 people were searching for #BookBrainChallenge), and from a card sign-up stand-point; in fact, the campaign broke the record for most card sign-ups ever in one month by 26%.\n\nHow has implementing public relations at your library improved the community involvement at WCLS?\n\nImplementing public relations has made a measurable (and significant) impact on circulation, cardholders and online engagement. Not only have we received greater patron engagement (a 4% increase in cardholders and 12% increase in circulation in the last two years), we’ve also increased our community partners, including local businesses and non-profits."
