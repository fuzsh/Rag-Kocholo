Its architects helped shape his RNC platform\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast on July 2 that Republicans are \"in the process of taking this country back.\" Former U.S. Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia hosted the show for Bannon, who is serving a four-month prison term.\n\n\"We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\" Roberts said.\n\nThose comments were widely circulated online and assailed by Biden's campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of \"dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.\"\n\nMORE COVERAGE: RNC committee adopts GOP's 2024 policy platform\n\nFormer President Trump has been attempting to distance himself from Project 2025 recently, but some of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior administration officials. The project's director is Paul Dans, who served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under Trump. Trump's campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was featured in one of Project 2025's videos.\n\nJohn McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser. McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire earlier this year that Project 2025's team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
