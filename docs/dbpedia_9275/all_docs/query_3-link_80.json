        "text": "The founders of the great libraries of the 19th century were often ambivalent about whether their goal was to disseminate or conserve knowledge. They were also uncertain about the intended audience. John Cotton Dana of the Newark Public Library was atypical in his populist stance that “it is a proper function of a library to amuse.” He argued that a “shallow mind” was better than an “empty one.” Other librarians preferred to see themselves as cultivators of public taste and their buildings as uplifting houses of culture. The stuffiness and remoteness of late nineteenth-century libraries provoked this humorous sketch, published in Life magazine in 1884, which satirized the closed-door practices of the theoretically “public” library donated by wealthy James Lenox to New York City.\n\nTHE LENOX LIBRARY\n\nWhat is this?\n\nThis, dear, is the great Lenox Library.\n\nWhat is it for?\n\nNobody knows.\n\nBut I thought you said it was a library.\n\nSo I did.\n\nThen there must be books in it\n\nPerhaps.\n\nWhy is it called the “Lenox” Library?\n\nBecause it was founded and given by Mr. James Lenox.\n\nGiven to whom?\n\nTo the city of New York.\n\nOh! then it is a public library?\n\nYes, dear.\n\nHow delightful! Why it must be very useful to students and the reading public?\n\nVery.\n\nBut why are the doors locked?\n\nTo keep people out.\n\nBut I thought you said it was a public library?\n\nSo I did.\n\nThen how can they keep people out?\n\nBy locking the doors.\n\nBut why?\n\nTo keep the pretty books from being spoiled.\n\nWhy!who would spoil the pretty books?\n\nThe public.\n\nHow?\n\nBy reading them.\n\nGracious! What are all those brass things on the roof?\n\nCannon, dear.\n\nWhat are they for?\n\nTo blow the heads off students who want to get in.\n\nWhy! and see those gallows!\n\nYes, dear.\n\nAnd people hanging!\n\nCertainly, sweet.\n\nWho are they?\n\nStudents who got in.\n\nBut is there no way of getting into the library without being shot or hanged?\n\nYes, sweet.\n\nHow?\n\nBy writing an humble letter of application to the kind Lord High Librarian.\n\nWell?\n\nHe will refer you to the 1st Assistant Inspector of Character.\n\nAnd then?\n\nIt will go to the Third Deputy Examiner of Morals.\n\nNext?\n\nHe will pass it on to the Comptroller of Ways and Means.\n\nAnd he?\n\nHe will, after mature deliberation, send it to the Commercial Agency.\n\nWhat for?\n\nTo get a proper understanding of the applicant’s solvency.\n\nWell?\n\nThen it comes back for the monthly meeting of the Sub-Committee on Private Inquiry.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo ascertain if the applicant has any real necessity for consulting any particular book in the library.\n\nAnd suppose he has?\n\nWhy, then the paper goes to the Sub-janitor.\n\nAnd what does he do?\n\nHe finds out if the Astor or the Mercantile Libraries have the book.\n\nAnd if they have?\n\nHe tells the applicant to go there and consult it.\n\nBut if they have it not?\n\nThen the application goes to the Commissioner of Vital Statistics.\n\nFor what purpose?\n\nTo ascertain if the applicant is still living.\n\nAnd if he is?\n\nAt the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors, if there is a quorum present, which sometimes happens, he will get a ticket entitling him to admission between the hours of two and three on a specified day.\n\nBut if the applicant is busy on that day at that hour?\n\nHe forfeits his ticket.\n\nBut how’s the public benefited by this “public” library?\n\nAsk the Trustees.\n\nSource: Life, 17 January 1884.
