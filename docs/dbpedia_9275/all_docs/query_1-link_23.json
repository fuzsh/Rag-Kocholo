        "text": "JOHN COTTON DANA\n\nby Lyman Whitney Allen\n\nThat is his portrait,—high bequest\n\nTo our Museum’s hall.\n\nThe artist painted at his best\n\nThe one whose features well attest\n\nWhat mind and heart install.\n\nThere is no genius such as his\n\nMidst Newark’s throngs of men.\n\nTo him be praise for what he is,\n\nAnd for his gracious ministries\n\nPast threescore years and ten.\n\nHis name and fame are heralded\n\nWhere lore has reverence.\n\nCourageous followers daily tread\n\nAscension paths his faith has led\n\nSoul’s triumph over sense.\n\nHe holds the keys of Learning’s doors\n\nTo Wisdom’s House of Light.\n\nHe gathers Culture’s golden stores,\n\nInterpreting the metaphors\n\nA city’s dreams incite.\n\nHis vision lured the princely gift\n\nOf a great merchant’s heart.\n\nFine natures, they together lift\n\nThe veils from Beauty, turn the drift\n\nOf wealth to calls of Art.\n\nWhat streams of inspiration flow\n\nOut of his life’s survey!\n\n’Neath healing shades they gently go,\n\nWhile time can never overthrow\n\nThe hopes along their way.\n\nAll hail to Newark’s honored Sage\n\nThis five and twentieth year!\n\nFor him be long and mellowing age,\n\nWith vistas of earth’s heritage\n\nThat comes from his career.\n\nLIBERATOR\n\nby Gerald Raftery\n\nHe hurled no ultimatum at the state\n\nNor led a revolution out to cry\n\nAn empty creed against the empty sky.\n\nNor ever did he play upon the hate\n\nOf poor for rich, of ignorant for great.\n\nAnd since his slow revolt was fine and high\n\nFor him no banners dip along the sky,\n\nNo cannons roar, no millions venerate.\n\nHis deed was not a sudden, blaring thing;\n\nIt was a lifework, patient, unacclaimed.\n\nAnd now before the searching mind of youth\n\nThe serried thinkers of the ages fling\n\nTheir gold. This man made knowledge free, unchained;\n\nHe loosed the slow, invading tide of truth.\n\nTo John Cotton Dana, Newark’s great champion of democratic culture, the worth of poetry and the other arts lay in one’s own experience of them. The pioneering director of the city’s library and museum considered popular songs and jingles “good poetry to the thousands who read and love them.” Dana insisted on the presence of poetry “in life itself, in homely everyday relations, in passing sentiments,” whether or not it found expression in the written word. (The Newarker, July 1912)\n\nLyman Whitney Allen composed his tribute on seeing Douglas Volk’s portrait exhibited in the newly opened home of the Newark Museum. The museum building, paid for by businessman and philanthropist Louis Bamberger (“the princely gift / of a great merchant’s heart”), was dedicated in 1926. In the same year Dana turned 70—on August 19—and marked 25 years of service to the artistic and cultural life of his adopted city. Since 2009 Volk’s painting has been displayed in the Dana Room of the Dana Library, on the Newark campus of Rutgers University.\n\nAllen’s poem was printed in the Newark Sunday Call of March 6, 1927. Gerald Raftery’s, one of many homages paid Dana after his death, appeared in the New York World on September 16, 1929, and in the Newark Evening News three days later."
