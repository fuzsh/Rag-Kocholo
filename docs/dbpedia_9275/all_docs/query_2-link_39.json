        "text": "You've just got a couple of days left to enter the CRN sales and marketing awards! I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm a judge for the awards and have been for the last 4 years. ü§ó If you‚Äôre entering, here are four tips you've got to know: 1. We look at about 80 entries, so make yours clear, concise, and eye-catching. 2. Don‚Äôt overrun on timings in video entries (really, just don't!). 3. Focus hard on the guidance notes (they‚Äôre there to lead you). 4. Make sure you show how your entry is properly dedicated to the category. Any other tips from the other judges? Let‚Äôs make this a space for sharing. üòÖ #CRNSMAs #JudgingTips #BestPractices Sara Yirrell Gina Hough Darren Spence Carl West Sara Driscoll Richard Eglon - MCIM CMktr\n\nThe The Marketing Society Scotland Star Awards nominations have just been announced. They are our industry‚Äôs ‚ÄôOscars‚Äô; held each year to celebrate excellence in all aspects of marketing. And my goodness, 40 agencies/clients have been nominated for their work across 18 categories. That‚Äôs 106 nominations in total. The winners will be announced later this year; but just to get to this point, agencies and clients have worked hard to encapsulate their successes in the hope of persuading the judges that their work deserves recognition. So congratulations to everyone who‚Äôs picked up a nomination. ‚ÄòRespect‚Äô as they say. Speaking for ourselves, I‚Äôm delighted for our passionate team at The Union who have managed to garner no less than 11 nominations. (Which happens to be more than anyone else.) And we feature in 7 different marketing categories. Clients such as The Scottish Government, schuh, Scottish Widows , PIRC, Zero Waste Scotland and The Data Lab have all been selected. This is no accident. It can‚Äôt happen without brilliant clients, and our Unionites who care deeply about the work they do. Not to mention the effort, skill and thought that goes into preparing a strong entry. But we‚Äôre not getting carried away. With over 15 years of experience in entering these awards, we know that a nomination is a guarantee of absolutely nothing. It all comes down to the judges‚Äô final selection; and all will be revealed on the night. (Thursday 20 June 2024 at the O2 Academy in Edinburgh.) So we‚Äôll be there in hope rather than in expectation. But it‚Äôs a night to look forward to; and to enjoy. https://lnkd.in/e4Ghj2Nu\n\nüõëExciting Update!
