        "text": "Johnny Cash was one of the most imposing and influential figures in post-World War II country music. With his deep, resonant baritone voice and unique guitar playing, Johnny Cash had his own distinctive style.\n\nCash was like no other artist in the country world. He created his own genre, halfway between the emotional nature of music, the rebelliousness of rock and roll, and country fatigue.\n\nCash's career coincided with the birth of rock and roll, and his singing and playing style had a lot in common with rock music. However, the musician is also heavy on the historical component in music - as he would later illustrate with his series of historical albums - this forever connected him with his country.\n\nJohnny Cash was also one of the biggest country music stars of the 50s and 60s with over 100 hit singles.\n\nLife before starting a musical career\n\nJohnny Cash, whose birth name is J.R. Cash, was born and raised in Arkansas and moved to Dyes when he was three years old.\n\nBy the time he was 12 years old, he began to write his own songs. He was inspired by country songs he heard on the radio. When Cash was in high school, he sang on the Arkansas radio station KLCN.\n\nJohnny Cash graduated from high school in 1950, moving to Detroit to work briefly in an automobile factory. With the outbreak of the Korean War, he enlisted in the US Air Force.\n\nWhile in the Air Force, Cash bought his first guitar and taught himself to play. He began writing songs in earnest, including \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Cash left the Air Force in 1954, married a Texas woman named Vivian Leberto, and moved to Memphis where he took a course in radio broadcasting at the G.I. Bill Broadcasting School.\n\nIn the evenings, he played country music in a trio that also consisted of guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. The trio occasionally played for free on local radio station KWEM and attempted to secure gigs and auditions at Sun Records.\n\nJohnny Cash's road to success\n\nThe young man finally got an audition with Sun Records in 1955. Cash soon released \"Cry Cry Cry\" / \"Hey Porter\" as his debut single for Sun. Phillips, the founder of the label named the singer by the name Johnny, which upset the guy because he thought that such a name sounded too young.\n\nThe single \"Cry Cry Cry\" became a success upon its release in 1955, it entered the national charts at number 14. The second single \"Folsom Prison Blues\" hit the top five in the country in early 1956, and its follow-up \"I Walk the Line ” ranked number one for six weeks and made it into the top 20 pop music tracks.\n\nCash was an equally successful performer in 1957, with several hits in the country, including the Top 15 single \"Give My Love to Rose\".\n\nCash also debuted at the Grand Ole Opry that same year, wearing black while the other performers wore bright, rhinestone-embellished outfits. In the end, he received the nickname \"The Man in Black\" (The Man in Black).\n\nCash became the first artist on the Sun label to release a \"long-playing\" album in November 1957. Then Johnny Cash with his Hot and Blue Guitar entered all music stores.\n\nCash's success continued to ride well into 1958 when Cash recorded his biggest hit, \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\" (number one on the charts for ten weeks), as well as another hit single, \"Guess Things Happen That Way\". For most of 1958, Cash tried to record a gospel album, but Sun Records refused to let him record it.\n\nSun was also unwilling to increase Cash's royalties. Both of these factors were decisive in the idea of ​​the vocalist to leave the label and sign with Columbia Records in 1958.\n\nBy the end of the year, he released his first single for the label, \"All Over Again\", which became another Top Five hit. Sun continued to release singles and albums of Cash's unreleased material into the 60s.\n\nInter-label rivalry for Johnny Cash\n\n\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\", Johnny Cash's second single for Columbia, was one of his biggest hits, reaching the top of the country charts. During this year, Sun Records and Columbia Records vied for the top of the charts, releasing singles from the musician. As a general rule, Columbia releases - \"Frankie's Man Johnny\", \"I Got Stripes\" and \"Five Feet High and Rising\" - performed better than the Sun singles, but \"Luther Played the Boogie\" did make the top ten.\n\nThat same year, Cash had the opportunity to make his gospel record, Hymns by Johnny Cash.\n\nThe Tennessee Two became the Tennessee Three in 1960 with the addition of drummer WS Holland.\n\nProblems in life - a crisis in creativity\n\nAlthough Cash continued to produce hits, the relentless pace of his career was beginning to take its toll on his money. In 1959, the musician began taking amphetamines to help him cope with a schedule of almost 300 concerts a year.\n\nBy 1961, his drug use had skyrocketed, causing his work to suffer. This was strongly reflected in the declining number of singles and albums. By 1963, the singer had moved to New York, leaving his family behind.\n\nJune Carter, who was the wife of one of Cash's drinking buddies, Carl Smith, will ensure he returns to the top of the charts with \"Ring of Fire\". She co-wrote it with Merle Kilgore.\n\nThe single \"Ring of Fire\" spent seven weeks at the top of the charts and reached the top 20 hits. Cash continued his success in 1964 when \"Understand Your Man\" became a number one hit.\n\nHowever, Cash's return was short-lived as he sank into his drug addiction and his hit singles appeared only sporadically.\n\nCash was arrested in El Paso for attempting to smuggle amphetamine into the country in his guitar case in 1965.\n\nIn the same year, the Grand Ole Opry withdrew from the performance of the musician.\n\nIn 1966, Cash's wife, Vivian, filed for divorce. After the divorce, Cash moved to Nashville. At first he led the same way of life, but soon Johnny became friends with June Carter, who divorced Carl Smith.\n\nWith Carter's help, he was able to kick his addictions; he also converted to Christianity. His career began to bounce back when \"Jackson\" and \"Rosanna's Going Wild\" hit the top ten.\n\nIn early 1968, during a concert, Cash proposed marriage to Carter; the couple married that spring.\n\nNew Johnny records\n\nAlso in 1968, Cash recorded and released his most popular album, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison. By the end of the year, the record went gold.\n\nThe following year, the musician released a sequel, Johnny Cash at San Quentin, which featured his only Top 10 pop single, \"A Boy Named Sue\". It reached number three on the chart.\n\nJohnny Cash appeared on Bob Dylan's 1969 country rock album Nashville Skyline as a guest musician. Dylan returned the favor to a colleague by appearing on the first episode of The Johnny Cash Show, the singer's television program for ABC. The Johnny Cash Show ran for two years, from 1969 to 1971.\n\nCash reached its second peak in popularity in 1970. In addition to his television show, he has performed for President Richard Nixon at the White House, played with Kirk Douglas in Gunfight, sang with John Williams and the Boston Pop Band, and has been featured in a documentary.\n\nHis album sales were equally good, as \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" and \"Flesh and Blood\" were number one hits.\n\nThroughout 1971, Cash still had some hits in his arsenal, including the most popular composition \"Man in Black\".\n\nCash and Carter became more socially active in the early 70s, campaigning for the civil rights of Native Americans and prisoners, and often working with Billy Graham.\n\nIn the mid-70s, Cash's presence on the country charts began to wane, but he continued to score occasional hits such as 1976's \"One Piece in Time\", \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" and \"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky.\"\n\nMan in Black, Johnny Cash's autobiography, was published in 1975.\n\nIn 1980, he became the youngest performer to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. However, the 80s were a challenging time for Cash as his record sales continued to decline and he ran into problems with Columbia.\n\nCash, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis teamed up to make The Revenant in 1982. The film had little success.\n\nThe Highwaymen - a band featuring Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson - released their first album in 1985, which was also quite successful. The following year, Cash and Columbia Records ended their relationship, and the musician signed with Mercury Nashville.\n\nWork with the new label failed, as the company and the singer each fought for their own style.\n\nIn addition, country radio began to favor more contemporary artists, and Cash soon found himself off the charts. Nevertheless, he continued to be a popular concert performer.\n\nThe Highwaymen recorded a second album in 1992 and it was more commercially successful than any of Cash's Mercury albums. Around the same time, his contract with Mercury ended.\n\nIn 1993, the singer signed a contract with American Records. His first album for the label, American Recordings, was released by label founder Rick Rubin himself and was an amazing acoustic collection of songs.\n\nThe album, while not a best-selling success, did a good job resurrecting Cash's career and bringing him into contact with a younger, rock-oriented audience.\n\nIn 1995, The Highwaymen released their third album, The Road Goes on Forever.\n\nThe following year, Cash released his second album for American Records, Unchained, which received support from Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Cash prepared the three-disc compilation \"Love, God, Murder\" dedicated to the main song themes that dominated throughout his career. A new studio album, American III: Solitary Man, appeared later that year.\n\nThe end of Johnny Cash's career\n\nHealth problems plagued Cash throughout the 90s and 2000s, but he continued to record in the studio.\n\nIn 2003, Mark Romanek's music video for a Nine Inch Nails cover of \"Hurt\" received significant acclaim and media attention, culminating in a surprise nomination for Video of the Year at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nShortly after the video generated positive reviews, Johnny Cash's beloved wife, June Carter Cash, died of complications from heart surgery.\n\nFour months later, in Nashville, Tennessee, Johnny also died of complications from diabetes.\n\nHe was 71 years old. Five months later, the \"Legend of Johnny Cash\" compilation hit the top ten. In 2006, Lost Highway released another series of Cash's legendary \"American\" recordings, American V: A Hundred Highways, from the late singer's last sessions with collaborator Rick Rubin.\n\nThe last release of these sessions appeared in early 2010 under the title American VI: Ain't No Grave and is reportedly the last release from American Recordings.\n\nSony Legacy in 2011 launched a series of rare, unreleased or hard-to-find Cash tracks from the two-disc albums Bootleg, Vol. 1: Personal File.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, Out Out of the Stars appeared - a collection of unreleased material recorded in the early 80s."
