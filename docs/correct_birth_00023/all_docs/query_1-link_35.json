        "text": "Background\n\nJohnny Cash, born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, is a widely celebrated name in the music industry. His impact on music transcends genre and is immeasurable. Cash still has multitudes of fans worldwide who find bliss in his music and draw from his experience. He was and will always be a musical genius. Cash was the middle child of seven. His father, Ray Cash, and his mother, Carrie Cloverlee, were poor cotton farmers who barely made ends meet. Cash was primarily English and Scottish, however, he has Cherokee lineage too. He was a Pisces, raised in a deeply religious household. He started playing songs at age 12, and at 18, he got enlisted in the Airforce. In 1954, after four years of service, Cash was honorably discharged. He married his first wife, Vivian Liberto a month later, and the pair moved to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nCash decided it was time to pursue music. He went to Sun Records and auditioned with gospel songs. He wasn’t successful as the producer stopped recording gospel songs. However, in 1955, he released his first two songs, ‘Hey Porter’ and ‘Cry Cry,’ after winning over the producer. Cash released ‘Folsom Prison Blues’ next, and ‘I Walk the Line’ peaked at number one on the country charts, but he was considering leaving Sun Records. He left in 1958 after releasing a long-playing album and signed with Columbia Records the same year. His first release with Columbia Records was the smash hit ‘Don’t Take Your Guns to Town.’ Cash had a habit of only adorning black clothes in the early stage of his career. He was nicknamed ‘The Undertaker’ in the ‘60s and ‘The Man in Black’ in the early ‘70s. He became addicted to amphetamines in the ‘60s and had erratic behavior. He even burned down the Los Padres National Forest during a camping trip — by accident, of course, but under the influence.\n\nThese episodes cultivated an outlaw persona for Cash, and he was reaching a destructive level of drug addiction. Despite his vices, Cash continued to gain success. In 1967, he made a duet with June Carter called ‘Jackson.’ The performance won a Grammy in 1968. Cash went on to sing in prisons, release multiple records, and win endless awards. By June 1969, he starred in his T.V. show called “The Johnny Cash Show” on A.B.C. for two years. Cash went on to win 18 Grammys, seven Hall of Fame inductions, nine C.M.A. awards, and several others for his celebrated discography. However, following multiple illnesses, the Cash ride ended on September 12, 2003. He was a legendary performer, country musician, and icon. He had four daughters from his first marriage to Liberto, which ended in 1966, and one child with his singer second wife, June Carter. He also had two step-children."
