        "text": "For Johnny Cash, the chapter in his early life concerning Kingsland, Arkansas, was a short one but it is nevertheless important, both to him and the history of the state.

Perhaps no town is less the domain of kings that Kingsland, which Cash himself once referred to merely as a “wide place in the road.” Kingsland’s name was about as close as the Cash family or any other residents had to royalty. Kingsland has always been a small, working class town. Cash’s time there was brief, but it was a fitting beginning for a man who became one of the great poets of small town America in a home state, Arkansas, know for its rural character…\n\nThe full article is available here: The Days before Dyess."
