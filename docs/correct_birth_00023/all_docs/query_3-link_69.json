Cash was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\".\n\nBorn to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after four years in the Air Force. He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,\" followed by \"Folsom Prison Blues\", one of his signature songs. Alongside \"Folsom Prison Blues\", his other signature songs include \"I Walk the Line\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\", and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\", a duet with his future wife June called \"Jackson\" , and railroad songs such as \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\", and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, he covered songs by contemporary rock artists of the time; his most notable covers were \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails, \"Rusty Cage\" by Soundgarden, and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode.\n\nCash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\n\nEarly life\n\nCash's boyhood home in Dyess, Arkansas, where he lived from the age of three in 1935 until he finished high school in 1950; the property, pictured here in 2013, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nCash was born J. R. Cash in Kingsland, Arkansas, on February 26, 1932, the son of Carrie Cloveree and Ray Cash. He had three older siblings, named Roy, Margaret Louise, and Jack, and three younger siblings, named Reba, Joanne, and Tommy . He was primarily of English and Scottish descent. His paternal grandmother also claimed Cherokee ancestry. He traced his Scottish surname to 11th-century Fife after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart. Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family. He is a distant cousin of British Conservative politician Sir William Cash. His mother wanted to name him John and his father preferred to name him Ray, so J. R. ended up being the only compromise they could agree on. When Cash enlisted in the Air Force, he was not permitted to use initials as a first name, so he changed it to John R. Cash. In 1955, when signing with Sun Records, he started using the name Johnny Cash.\n\nIn March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony established to give poor families the opportunity to work land that they may later own. From the age of five, he worked in cotton fields with his family, singing with them as they worked. The Cash farm in Dyess experienced a flood, which led Cash later to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, he had lifelong sympathy for the poor and working class.\n\nOn May 13, 1944, Cash's older brother Jack, with whom he was close, was seriously injured in an accident at his job in a high school when he was pulled into an unguarded table saw while cutting oak into fence posts, and was almost cut in two. He died from his injuries a week later. Cash often spoke of the guilt he felt over this incident; according to his autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Cash, his mother, and Jack himself all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with Cash, but Jack insisted on working as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of the afterlife and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to \"meeting brother in Heaven\".\n\nCash's early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a high-tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed. In high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs called My Mother's Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.\n\nCash enlisted in the Air Force on July 7, 1950. After basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and technical training at Brooks Air Force Base, both in San Antonio, Texas, Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile of the U.S. Air Force Security Service at Landsberg, West Germany. He worked as a Morse code operator intercepting Soviet Army transmissions. While at Landsberg he created his first band, \"The Landsberg Barbarians\". On March 3, 1953, he received a telegram noting that Soviet Premier Stalin had died making him the first westerner to be aware of the death. On July 3, 1954, he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant, and he returned to Texas. During his military service, he acquired a distinctive scar on the right side of his jaw as a result of surgery to remove a cyst.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\n\nPublicity photo for Sun Records, 1955\n\nIn 1954, Cash and Vivian moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he had sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. Perkins and Grant were known as the Tennessee Two. Cash worked up the courage to visit the Sun Records studio, hoping to get a recording contract. He auditioned for Sam Phillips by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\", although in a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment. Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"Hey Porter\" and \"Cry! Cry! Cry!\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country hit parade.\n\nOn December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips while Carl Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks, with Jerry Lee Lewis backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an impromptu jam session. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title Million Dollar Quartet. In Cash: the Autobiography, Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"I Walk the Line\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"Home of the Blues\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with Columbia Records. His single \"Don't Take Your Guns to Town\" became one of his biggest hits, and he recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums from, featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"Oh Lonesome Me\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.\n\nThe Tennessee Three with Cash in 1963\n\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included Mother Maybelle's daughters, Anita, June, and Helen. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on Pete Seeger's short-lived television series Rainbow Quest. He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled Five Minutes to Live, later re-released as Door-to-door Maniac.\n\nCash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London, Ontario, promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic My Father and the Man in Black.\n\nOutlaw image\n\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction.\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of \"Ring of Fire\" was a crossover hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash. He said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\". In her book, I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny, Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.\n\nIn June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in Los Padres National Forest in California, triggering a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death. Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thinks that Cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of control. When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, \"I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it.\"\n\nThe fire destroyed 508 acres , burned the foliage off three mountains and drove off 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered California condors. Cash was unrepentant and claimed, \"I don't care about your damn yellow buzzards.\" The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,172. Cash eventually settled the case and paid $82,001. As of 2018 there are 488 California condors living wild or in captivity.\n\nAlthough Cash cultivated a romantic outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in El Paso, Texas, by a narcotics squad. The officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 Dexedrine capsules and 475 Equanil tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence. Cash posted a $1,500 bond and then was released until his arraignment.\n\nIn this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of concept albums. His Bitter Tears was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of Native Americans and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His Sings the Ballads of the True West was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash was divorced from his first wife and had performances cancelled, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"Jackson,\" won a Grammy Award.\n\nCash was last arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people and raised $75,000 for the high school. Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"\n\nThere is an unconfirmed story that in early 1967, Cash had a spiritual epiphany in the Nickajack Cave. The story says that Cash had attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deep into the cave, trying to lose himself and \"just die\", but passed out on the floor. Utterly discouraged, he felt God's presence in his heart and struggled out of the cave by following a faint light and slight breeze. To him, the incident represented his rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up.\"\n\nCash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an \"altar call\" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend Hank Snow. According to Marshall Grant, though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968. Cash did not end all drug use until 1970, staying drug-free for a period of seven years. Grant claims that the birth of Cash's son, John Carter Cash, inspired Cash to end his dependence.\n\nCash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again and became a patient at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. By 1989, he was dependent and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in Loma Linda, California, for his final rehabilitation treatment. .\n\nFolsom and other prison concerts\n\nCash began performing concerts at prisons in the late 1950s. He played his first famous prison concert on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison. These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison and Johnny Cash at San Quentin . Both live albums reached number one on Billboard country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the Billboard pop album chart. In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even The Beatles by selling 6.5 million albums. In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as Strawberry Cake recorded in London and Live at Madison Square Garden, which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.\n\nThe Folsom Prison record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\" while the San Quentin record included the crossover hit single \"A Boy Named Sue\", a Shel Silverstein-penned novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. top-10 pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out of the aired version. The modern CD versions are unedited, thus making them longer than on the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience-reaction overdubs of the originals.\n\nCash performed at the ÃsterÃ¥ker Prison in Sweden in 1972. The live album PÃ¥ ÃsterÃ¥ker was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"ÃsterÃ¥ker\". In 1976, a concert at Tennessee State Prison was videotaped for TV broadcast, and received a belated CD release after Cash's death as A Concert Behind Prison Walls.\n\nActivism for Native Americans\n\nIn 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, Rainbow Quest, on which Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans:\n\nIn '57, I wrote a song called 'Old Apache Squaw' and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.\n\nColumbia, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it \"too radical for the public\". Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who simply makes the native's soil his own.\n\nIn 1964, coming off the chart success of his previous album \"I Walk The Line\", he recorded the aforementioned album Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian.\n\nWe're Still Here: Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears Revisited, a documentary by Antonino D'Ambrosio tells the story of Johnny Cash's controversial concept album \"Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian\", covering the struggles of Native Americans. The film's DVD was released on August 21, 2018.\n\nThe album featured stories of a multitude of native peoples, mostly of their violent oppression by white settlers: the Pima , Navajo , Apache , Lakota , Seneca , and Cherokee . Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of Johnny Horton, but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk artist Peter La Farge , whom Cash met in New York in the 1960s and whom he admired for his activism. The album's single, \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes\" , was neglected by nonpolitical radio at the time, and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and \"unappealing\" nature. Cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the Country Music Association: \"You and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks, country artists, and country DJs.\"\n\nIn reaction, on August 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in Billboard, calling the record industry cowardly: \"D.J.s â station managers â owners ... where are your guts? I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY??? Ira Hayes is strong medicine ... So is Rochester, Harlem, Birmingham and Vietnam.\" Cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on radio disc jockeys he knew eventually to make the song climb to number three on the country charts, while the album rose to number two on the album charts.\n\nCash in 1969\n\nLater, on The Johnny Cash Show, he continued telling stories of Native-American plight, both in song and through short films, such as the history of the Trail of Tears.\n\nIn 1966, in response to his activism, the singer was adopted by the Seneca Nation's Turtle Clan. He performed benefits in 1968 at the Rosebud Reservation, close to the historical landmark of the massacre at Wounded Knee, to raise money to help build a school. He also played at the D-Q University in the 1980s.\n\nJohnny Cash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people. Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government. Many non-Native Americans stayed away from singing about these things.\n\nIn 1970, Cash recorded a reading of John G. Burnett's 1890 80th-birthday essay on Cherokee removal for the Historical Landmarks Association .\n\nThe Johnny Cash Show\n\nFrom June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, The Johnny Cash Show, on the ABC network. Produced by Screen Gems, the show was performed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The Statler Brothers opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including Linda Ronstadt in her first TV appearance, Neil Young, Louis Armstrong, Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition , James Taylor, Ray Charles, Roger Miller, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominos, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan.\n\nFrom September 15â18, 1969, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he performed a series of four concerts at the New Mexico State Fair to promote the first season of The Johnny Cash Show. These live shows were produced with help from ABC and local concert producer Bennie Sanchez, during these sets Johnny Cash and Al Hurricane performed together. Also during The Johnny Cash Show era, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film Little Fauss and Big Halsey, which starred Robert Redford, Michael J. Pollard, and Lauren Hutton. The title song, \"The Ballad of Little Fauss and Big Halsey\", written by Carl Perkins, was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1971.\n\nCash had met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became closer friends when they were neighbors in the late 1960s in Woodstock, New York. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan, âGirl from the North Countryâ, on Dylan's country album Nashville Skyline and also wrote the album's Grammy-winning liner notes.\n\nAnother artist who received a major career boost from The Johnny Cash Show was Kris Kristofferson, who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer-songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to marijuana intact:\n\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite\n\nOn a Sunday morning sidewalk\n\nI'm wishin', Lord, that I was stoned.\n\nThe closing program of The Johnny Cash Show was a gospel music special. Guests included the Blackwood Brothers, Mahalia Jackson, Stuart Hamblen, and Billy Graham.\n\n\"The Man in Black\"\n\nCash advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with President Richard Nixon\n\nBy the early 1970s, Cash had crystallized his public image as \"The Man in Black\". He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the rhinestone suits and cowboy boots worn by most of the major country acts of his day. In 1971, he wrote the song \"Man in Black\" to help explain his dress code:\n\nWe're doing mighty fine I do suppose\n\nIn our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes\n\nBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back\n\nUp front there ought to be a man in black.\n\nCash performing in Bremen, West Germany, in September 1972\n\nCash said he wore all black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the \"prisoner who has long paid for his crime\", and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs. He added, \"With the Vietnam War as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mournin' for the lives that could have been' ... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position ... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off.\"\n\nCash in the \"one piece at a time\" Cadillac\n\nHis band and he had initially worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color. The outdated US Navy's winter blue uniform used to be referred to by sailors as \"Johnny Cashes\", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for Amoco and STP, an unpopular enterprise at the time of the 1970s energy crisis. In 1976, he made commercials for Lionel Trains, for which he also wrote the music. However, his first autobiography, Man in Black, was published in 1975 and sold 1.3 million copies. A second, Cash: The Autobiography, appeared in 1997.\n\nCash's friendship with Billy Graham led to his production of a film about the life of Jesus, The Gospel Road, which Cash co-wrote and narrated. It was released in 1973. Cash viewed the film as a statement of his personal faith rather than a means of proselytizing.\n\nCash and June Carter Cash appeared several times on the Billy Graham Crusade TV specials, and Cash continued to include gospel and religious songs on many of his albums, though Columbia declined to release A Believer Sings the Truth, a gospel double-LP Cash recorded in 1979 and which ended up being released on an independent label even with Cash still under contract to Columbia. On November 22, 1974, CBS ran his one-hour TV special entitled Riding The Rails, a musical history of trains.\n\nHe continued to appear on television, hosting Christmas specials on CBS in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of Columbo, entitled \"Swan Song\". June and he appeared in an episode of Little House on the Prairie, entitled \"The Collection\". He gave a performance as John Brown in the 1985 American Civil War television miniseries North and South. Johnny and June also appeared in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman in recurring roles.\n\nHe was friendly with every US president, starting with Richard Nixon. He was closest to Jimmy Carter, with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June.\n\nWhen invited to perform at the White House for the first time in 1970, Richard Nixon's office requested that he play \"Okie from Muskogee\" , \"Welfare Cadillac\" , and \"A Boy Named Sue\". Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes\" , and his own compositions, \"What Is Truth\" and \"Man in Black\". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason. However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed \"antihippie and antiblack\" sentiments might have backfired. In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked that one thing he had learned about the singer was one did not tell him what to sing.\n\nJohnny Cash was the grand marshal of the United States Bicentennial parade. He wore a shirt from Nudie Cohn which sold for $25,000 in auction in 2010. After the parade he gave a concert at the Washington monument.\n\nHighwaymen and departure from Columbia Records\n\nThe Highwaymen members Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson\n\nIn 1980, Cash became the Country Music Hall of Fame's youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson as The Highwaymen, making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled Highwayman in 1985, followed by Highwaymen 2 in 1990, and concluding with Highwaymen â The Road Goes On Forever in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in The Pride of Jesse Hallam, winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult illiteracy. In the same year, Cash appeared as a \"very special guest star\" in an episode of the Muppet Show. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in Murder in Coweta County, based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred Andy Griffith as his nemesis and featured June Carter in a small but important role. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings , Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent double bypass surgery in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"near-death experience\".\n\nCash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him .\n\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"Chicken in Black\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book Johnny Cash: The Life, disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash â who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" â accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video , and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from storesâinterrupting its bona fide chart successâand termed the venture \"a fiasco.\"\n\nBetween 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed countrypolitan producer Billy Sherrill , which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, Legacy Recordings, in 2014 as Out Among the Stars. Around this time, Cash also recorded an album of gospel recordings that ended up being released by another label around the time of his departure from Columbia .\n\nAfter more unsuccessful recordings were released between 1984â85, Cash left Columbia .\n\nIn 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album Class of '55; according to Hilburn, Columbia still had Cash under contract at the time, so special arrangements had to be made to allow him to participate. Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, Man in White, a book about Saul and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He recorded Johnny Cash Reads The Complete New Testament in 1990.\n\nAmerican Recordings\n\nJohnny Cash sings with a Navy lieutenant during a military event c. January 1987\n\nAfter Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with Mercury Records from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as Water from the Wells of Home, a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children Rosanne Cash and John Carter Cash, as well as Paul McCartney. A one-off Christmas album recorded for Delta Records followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death , his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians Marc Riley and Jon Langford put together 'Til Things Are Brighter, a tribute album featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Rosanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1991, he sang a version of \"Man in Black\" for the Christian punk band One Bad Pig's album I Scream Sunday. In 1993, he sang \"The Wanderer\", the closing track of U2's album Zooropa. According to Rolling Stone writer Adam Gold, \"The Wanderer\" â written for Cash by Bono, \"defies both the U2 and Cash canons, combining rhythmic and textural elements of Nineties synth-pop with a Countrypolitan lament fit for the closing credits of a Seventies western.\"\n\nNo longer sought-after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer Rick Rubin's American Recordings label, which had recently been rebranded from Def American, under which name it was better known for rap and hard rock. Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded American Recordings in his living room, accompanied only by his Martin Dreadnought guitar â one of many Cash played throughout his career. The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin including \"Down There by the Train\" by Tom Waits. The album had a great deal of critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with Brooks & Dunn to contribute \"Folsom Prison Blues\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. On the same album, he performed the Bob Dylan favorite \"Forever Young.\"\n\nCash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He also lent his voice for a cameo role in The Simpsons episode \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer \", as the \"Space Coyote\" that guides Homer Simpson on a spiritual quest.\n\nCash was joined by guitarist Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, bassist Krist Novoselic of Nirvana, and drummer Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains for a cover of Willie Nelson's \"Time of the Preacher\", featured on the tribute album Twisted Willie, released in January 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Cash enlisted the accompaniment of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and released Unchained , which won the Best Country Album Grammy in 1998. The album was produced by Rick Rubin with Sylvia Massy engineering and mixing. A majority of Unchained was recorded at Sound City Studios and featured guest appearances by Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, and Marty Stuart. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography Man in Black, he wrote Cash: The Autobiography in 1997.\n\nLater years and death\n\nCash's original grave and the Cash/Carter memorial Cash with President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush in 2002\n\nIn 1997, during a trip to New York City, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease ShyâDrager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to ShyâDrager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\n\nDuring the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums American III: Solitary Man and American IV: The Man Comes Around . American IV included cover songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode.Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover \"Hurt\", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition. The video for \"Hurt\" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.\n\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, aged 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 songs in the last four months of his life. He even performed surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert , before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\n\nThe spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart.\n\nCash continued to record until shortly before his death. \"When June died, it tore him up,\" Rick Rubin recalled. \"He said to me, 'You have to keep me working because I will die if I don't have something to do.' He was in a wheelchair by then and we set him up at his home in Virginiaâ¦ I couldn't listen to those recordings for two years after he died and it was heartbreaking when we did.\" Cash's final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of \"Like the 309\", which appeared on American V: A Hundred Highways in 2006, and the final song he completed, \"Engine 143\", recorded for his son John Carter Cash's planned Carter Family tribute album.\n\nWhile being hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Cash died of complications from diabetes around 2:00 am CT on September 12, 2003, aged 71âless than four months after his wife. He was buried next to her in Hendersonville Memory Gardens near his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCash and his second wife, June Carter, in 1969\n\nOn July 18, 1951, while in Air Force basic training, Cash met 17-year-old Italian-American Vivian Liberto at a roller skating rink in San Antonio, Texas. They dated for three weeks until Cash was deployed to West Germany for a three-year tour. During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of love letters. On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. The Wedding Mass was offered by Vivian's uncle, a Catholic priest named Father Vincent Liberto. They had four daughters: Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, and Tara. In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking Casitas Springs, California. He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement. Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of adultery with other women, and his close relationship with singer June Carter. Their four daughters were then raised by their mother.\n\nCash met June of the famed Carter Family while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other. In 1968, 13 years after they first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in London, Ontario. The couple married on March 1, 1968, in Franklin, Kentucky. They had one child together, John Carter Cash, born March 3, 1970. He was the only son for both Johnny and June. In addition to having his four daughters and John Carter, Cash also became step-father to Carlene and Rosie; June's daughters from her first two marriages. Cash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music, and tour together for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off amphetamines, often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet. June remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of drug addiction. After June's death in 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music. He died four months after her.\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nCash was raised by his parents in the Southern Baptist denomination of Christianity. He was baptized in 1944 in the Tyronza River as a member of the Central Baptist Church of Dyess, Arkansas.\n\nA troubled but devout Christian, Cash has been characterized as a \"lens through which to view American contradictions and challenges.\" On May 9, 1971, he answered the altar call at Evangel Temple, an Assemblies of God congregation pastored by Jimmie R. Snow with outreach to people in the music world.\n\nA biblical scholar, Cash penned a Christian novel, Man in White in 1986 and in the introduction writes about a reporter, who, interested in Cash's religious beliefs, questioned whether the book is written from a Baptist, Catholic, or Jewish perspective. Cash replies \"I'm a Christian. Don't put me in another box.\"\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Cash and his wife, June, completed a course of study in the Bible through Christian International Bible College.:66 He often performed at Billy Graham Crusades. At a Tallahassee Crusade in 1986, June and Johnny sang his song \"One of These Days I'm Gonna Sit Down and Talk to Paul\". At a notable performance in Arkansas in 1989, Johnny Cash spoke to attendees of his commitment to the salvation of drug dealers and alcoholics. He then sang, \"Family Bible\".\n\nHe recorded several gospel albums and made a spoken-word recording of the entire New King James Version of the New Testament. Cash declared he was \"the biggest sinner of them all\", and viewed himself overall as a complicated and contradictory man. Accordingly, Cash is said to have \"contained multitudes,\" and has been deemed \"the philosopher-prince of American country music.\"\n\nCash is credited with having converted actor and singer John Schneider to Christianity.\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwgJFsbHJlmqS1r7rYZpqaq5hkr6q7xquYqaCpYq6vsIyfmJysow%3D%3D"
