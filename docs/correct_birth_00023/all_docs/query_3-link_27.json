        "text": "JOHNNY Cash is considered to be one of the greatest country singers of all time.\n\nBut even superstars can come from humble upbringings, just as Johnny did.\n\nWhere was Johnny Cash born?\n\nJohnny Cash was born in Kingsland, Arkansas, on February 26, 1932, to Carrie Cloveree and Ray Cash.\n\nHis mom Carrie helped her son peruse music at a young age and even taught him guitar.\n\nIn 1935, when he was three years old, the family relocated to Dyess, Arkansas.\n\nThey set up a home at a New Deal colony established to allow poor families to work land that they may later own.\n\nSadly, Johnny died of complications from diabetes on September 12, 2003, four months after his wife's passing.\n\nHe underwent various surgeries throughout his later life, such as on his jaw, heart, and knee after suffering from poor health.\n\nJohnny was known to have struggled with alcohol and drug abuse at several different stages of his life.\n\nThe singer was diagnosed with automatic neuropathy in 1997, a condition that can come with diabetes.\n\nDid Johnny Cash have any siblings?\n\nJohnny had six brothers and sisters in total.\n\nHe had three older siblings, Jack, Roy, and Margaret Louise, and three younger ones, Tommy, Reba, and Joanne.\n\nTommy Cash is also a country music star, after following in the footsteps of Johnny.\n\nSadly, the Cash family suffered a tragedy when Johnny's brother Jack was just 14 years old.\n\nWhile cutting wood one Saturday, he was accidentally pulled into a table saw.\n\nThe saw mangled Jack's body, almost cutting his body in two. He died a week after the terrible accident.\n\nWhen was Johnny Cash discovered?\n\nAfter military service, Johnny settled in Memphis, Tennessee, to pursue a musical career.\n\nPerformances with the Tennessee Two and at county fairs led to an audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records, who signed Cash in 1955.\n\nSongs like I Walk the Line, Hey, Porter, Folsom Prison Blues, and Cry, Cry, Cry brought him a lot of attention.\n\nBy 1957, Johnny was the top recording artist in the country and western field.\n\nAnother huge string to his bow came when on December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Sam Phillips while Carl Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks, with Jerry Lee Lewis backing him on piano.\n\nJohnny was also in the studio, and the four started an impromptu jam session.\n\nSam left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived.\n\nThey have since been released under the title Million Dollar Quartet and even turned into a West End play.\n\nIn the book Cash: the Autobiography, Johnny wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis."
