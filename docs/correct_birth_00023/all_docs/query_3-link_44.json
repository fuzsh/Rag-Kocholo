        "text": "There have been many books written about Johnny Cash, but The Man in Song is the first to examine Cash’s incredible life through the lens of the songs he wrote and recorded. Music journalist and historian John Alexander has drawn on decades of studying Cash’s music and life, from his difficult depression-era Arkansas childhood through his death in 2003, to tell a life story through songs familiar and obscure. In discovering why Cash wrote a given song or chose to record it, Alexander introduces readers anew to a man whose primary consideration of any song was the difference music makes in people’s lives, and not whether the song would become a hit.\n\nThe hits came, of course. Johnny Cash sold more than fifty million albums in forty years, and he holds the distinction of being the only performer inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. The Man in Song connects treasured songs to an incredible life. It explores the intertwined experience and creativity of childhood trauma. It rifles through the discography of a life: Cash’s work with the Tennessee Two at Sam Phillips’s Sun Studios, the unique concept albums Cash recorded for Columbia Records, the spiritual songs, the albums recorded live at prisons, songs about the love of his life, June Carter Cash, songs about murder and death and addiction, songs about ramblers, and even silly songs.\n\nAppropriate for both serious country and folk music enthusiasts and those just learning about this musical legend, The Man in Song will appeal to a fan base spanning generations. Here is a biography for those who first heard “I Walk the Line” in 1956, a younger generation who discovered Cash through songs like his cover of Trent Reznor’s “Hurt,” and everyone in between.\n\nChapter 1\n\nFive Feet High and Rising:Autobiographical, Geographical and Societal Songs\n\nChapter 2\n\nI Walk the Line: The Sun Years\n\nChapter 3\n\nWhat Is Truth: Songs of Personal Conviction\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Ballad of Ira Hayes: The Concept Albums\n\nChapter 5\n\nFar Side Banks of Jordan: The Gospel According to Cash\n\nChapter 6\n\nI Got Stripes: The Legendary Prison Recordings\n\nChapter 7\n\nRing of Fire: Songs for June\n\nChapter 8\n\nSunday Morning Coming Down: Kris Kristoffersonand the Great Singer-Songwriters\n\nChapter 9\n\nHeroes: Hank Williams, Bob Dylan and Other Musical Influences\n\nChapter 10\n\nHighwayman:Jack Clement, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Other Collaborations\n\nChapter 11\n\nDelia’s Gone: The Murder Ballads\n\nChapter 12\n\nCommitted to Parkview: Drug Use and Abuse\n\nChapter 13\n\nOne Piece at a Time: The Great Story Songs\n\nChapter 14\n\nYou Wild Colorado: Deep Cuts and Buried Treasures\n\nChapter 15\n\nI’ve Been Everywhere: Travelin’ Cash\n\nChapter 16\n\nThe Man Comes Around: The American Recordings\n\nChapter 17\n\nAin’t No Grave: The Songs Live On\n\nChapter 18\n\nSeptember When It Comes: Final Reflections"
