        "text": "Moving to Dyess\n\nRay and Carrie Cash left Kingland, Ark., in 1935 with five children (Joanne and Tommy Cash would be born later) and headed north to Mississippi County in search of a better life.\n\nWhy Mississippi County? Four words – Dyess Colony Resettlement Area. In May 1934, “Colonization Project No. 1” was established in southwestern Mississippi County and named for W. R. Dyess, Arkansas’s first Works Progress Administration head, who suggested the idea of giving tenant farmers the opportunity to own their own land to one of FDR’s advisors. The colony was laid out in a wagon-wheel design, with a community center at the hub and farms stretching out from the middle. There were 500 small farmhouses, each with five rooms and an adjacent barn, privy, and chicken coop. The houses were white-washed clapboard, each having two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a dining room, plus a front and back porch.\n\nBecoming a Legend\n\nYoung J.R. had a love of music from an early age. He would listen to his mother, Carrie, sing and play gospel music. She later taught him to play guitar. Carrie saved money so young J.R. could take singing lessons. The story goes that his vocal coach, after three lessons, told him to never take another class and to never let anyone change his singing style. He continued singing and would eventually perform on a local radio show while in high school.\n\nWhen Cash entered the Air Force, he was not allowed to use initials as his name so he instead he used John R. Cash. A few years later, when Sam Phillips signed Cash and the Tennessee Two to join Sun Records, he used the name Johnny and continued to use the moniker the remainder of his life. Those close to him still referred to him as J.R. or John. But to his masses of fans, he was Johnny.\n\nCash’s career accomplishments are tremendous. At the age of 48, Cash was the youngest living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Over the course of his career, he received 11 Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters’ Hall of Fame. He received the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of the Arts, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was a best-selling author. He appeared in numerous movies and television productions. Over his nearly 50-year career, Cash release 96 albums and 170 singles.\n\nWith his death in 2003, the world lost a musical legend and Arkansas lost one of its most notable sons. However, the life and accomplishments of Johnny Cash live on."
