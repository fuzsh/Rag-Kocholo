        "text": "City in Arkansas, United States\n\nCity in Arkansas, United States\n\nKingsland, officially the City of Kingsland, is a small city in Cleveland County, south central Arkansas, United States. It is included in the Pine Bluff, Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area, and had a population of 447 at the 2010 U.S. census. It is known as the birthplace of musician Johnny Cash. His parents had a cotton farm there.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1890 a two-story building was adapted for Kingsland's first public school. A new school was built in 1940 during the Great Depression as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects initiated by the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration.[3]\n\nCountry singer Johnny Cash was born in Kingsland in 1932 during the Great Depression to parents who were poor cotton farmers. The family moved when he was three. Cash returned to the town in March 1994, for the dedication of the new post office named in his honor.[4]\n\nIn May 2003, the 63-year-old main building at the Kingsland School was destroyed by fire. Damages were estimated to be over $2.1 million. The building's old pine, along with the varnish on the floors, oil on the wood inside, and a gas heating system all contributed to the fierce blaze.[5] Later, the fire was found to have resulted from arson. Two suspects, including a firefighter, were subsequently arrested.[6]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all land.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1890464—1900364−21.6%191044522.3%1920397−10.8%1930328−17.4%194047344.2%1950337−28.8%1960249−26.1%197030422.1%19803205.3%199039523.4%200044913.7%2010447−0.4%2020347−22.4%\n\nAs of the census[8] of 2010, there were 447 people, 177 households, and 121 families residing in the town.

The district was established by the July 1, 2004, consolidation of the Kingsland School District and the Rison School District.[9] Kingsland High School closed in 2004.[citation needed]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film Come Morning (2011) featured Kingsland as its setting.
