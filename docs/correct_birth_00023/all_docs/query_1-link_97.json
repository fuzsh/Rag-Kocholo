        "text": "In 1956, Johnny Cash had his first number-one hit on the Billboard charts with his song “I Walk the Line.” In an old interview, Cash recounted writing the song in Gladewater, Texas, during his first marriage. “At the time, I had recently gotten married, and I imagined I was telling my promise of affection,” he said. Though Cash’s most famous marriage was to June Carter, the song was written for Vivian Liberto, whom he shared a California home with until their divorce in 1966. The Ventura County abode was reportedly built to Cash’s specific specifications and was recently bought by a fan of the country singer.\n\nNestled in rural California, the 4,500-square-foot ranch-style home overlooks Casitas Springs in a secluded location where Cash, Liberto, and their daughters could find peace and privacy. The sale of the home was represented by Adam McKaig and Melissa Borders of Douglas Elliman, who noted in the listing that Cash reportedly held concerts on the hill above the house after setting up several amplifiers so the whole town could hear.\n\nMany of the Cash-specific details remain, including the primary bedroom full of country motifs and a curved brick fireplace, custom wood interiors, and an original turntable mounted on the wall. The home also features a second primary suite for Liberto, as Cash reportedly stayed up much later working on his music. Other lingering remnants of the songwriting legend include a wood-paneled study where Cash reportedly wrote some of his greatest hits. Outside, the property boasts a swimming pool, barbecue area, and expansive views of the Ojai Valley."
