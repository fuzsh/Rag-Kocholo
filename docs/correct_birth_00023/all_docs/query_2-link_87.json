        "text": "There were lots of Johnny Cashes: mamaâs boy, rabble-rouser, Bible-thumping hymn singer, and middle-fingered outlaw. When he was born to struggling cotton farmers in Arkansas in 1932, country was still consideredâand outright calledââhillbilly musicâ; by the time he died in 2003, the influence heâd had in shaping both the rebellion of rock ânâ roll and the preservationist spirit of modern country was undeniable. You could hear in Cash what you wanted to hear. But his music contained so muchâand yet was so casually singularâthat it made room for all. Part of Cashâs paradox is that he was at once a definitive country artist and a persistent challenger to ideas of what country is and could be. Never quite faithful to Nashville but never separatist either, his music seemed to exist on a parallel track, equally informed by the candor of folk and the stability of gospel, by the deference of tradition and the rugged bluntness of outlaw culture. By the time heâd refashioned himself as the Man in Black, with 1968âs and 1969âs twin prison albums At Folsom Prison and At San Quentin, heâd already generated a lifetimeâs worth of work. Out of a fallow â70s and â80s came the American series, which cast him as a mythic, almost deathless figure, a quiet fireside presence fortified by years of unspeakable weight. He often lived in chaosâsubstance abuse, run-ins with the law, a suicide attempt, and capitulations to God. But in his voice was a steadiness. Not sentimentâhe would neverâbut resolve."
