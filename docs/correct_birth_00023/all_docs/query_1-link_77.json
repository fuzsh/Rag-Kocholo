        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF/Gray News) – Two mothers in Alabama who did not know each other got the surprise of a lifetime when they gave birth to babies named Johnny Cash and June Carter at the same hospital.\n\nThe Clarks welcomed their daughter June Carter Clark on April 10 at Huntsville Hospital, just down the hallway from where the Davis family welcomed their son Johnny Cash Davis the same day.\n\nThe families said that this was the coincidence of a lifetime.\n\nMom Sophie Clark said they landed on the name June Carter because they simply loved the name June, and her husband’s first name is Carter.\n\nMom Nicole Davis said Johnny Cash wasn’t their first choice, but eventually decided it was the perfect fit.\n\n“[The baby’s] dad’s name is Johnny Lee Davis Jr. And we tried on Johnny Lee Davis III for a while, and we just could never get comfortable with it … it just never caught. So, we had to go back to the drawing board,” she said. “At first, we thought a lot about Nashville because we love that area, we spend a lot of time up that way … we thought Johnny Nashville at first, or Johnny Nash … but then we thought, ‘Oh wait a minute, Johnny Cash would be perfect, and we’ll call him Cash.’”\n\nThe families first found out about the coincidence thanks to an encounter in an elevator. A family member was visiting the baby girl and ran into Johnny Cash’s dad, who was wearing a Johnny Cash T-shirt.\n\nThe family member mentioned that it was interesting to see someone wearing a Johnny Cash T-shirt because he was there to meet baby June Carter.\n\nJohnny Cash’s dad responded, “That’s weird, we just had a baby named Johnny Cash.”\n\nThe family member then told the Clarks about the encounter, and the parents knew immediately that they had to meet the other family.\n\nThe Clarks explained the coincidence to a nurse and asked if they could meet the family down the hall.\n\n“And they said, ‘This couple wants to talk to you because their baby is named June Carter.’ And I thought, ‘Well okay, that’s the oddest coincidence I’ve ever heard of,’ but of course we immediately took [the babies] out in the hall and took pictures and exchanged information so that they will always have this cool coincidence to follow them as they grow, and they’ll always have a cool story,” Nicole Davis said.\n\nAfter taking photos together, the families exchanged information so they can keep in touch.\n\n“I just think it’s so fun that in a world where there’s lots of little babies that were born on April 10, these two guys are always gonna have this really fun back story and always have an opportunity to have a friend that they met in an unconventional but really special way,” Nicole Davis said.\n\nSophie Clark agreed.\n\n“I definitely want them to stay in touch. I just think it’s the coolest coincidence ever,” she said."
