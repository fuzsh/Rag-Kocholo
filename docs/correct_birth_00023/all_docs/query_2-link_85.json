Tapes were initially only available in auto-parts stores, as home 8-track equipment was still a year away.\n\n1968 - The Doors were forced to perform as a trio at a concert in Amsterdam after singer Jim Morrison collapsed while dancing during the Jefferson Airplane's performance.\n\n1970 - Vice President Spiro Agnew said in a speech that the youth of America were being \"brainwashed into a drug culture\" by rock music, movies, books and underground newspapers.\n\n1979 - Led Zeppelin scored their sixth U.S. No. 1 album when In Through The Out Door started a seven-week run at the top of the charts.\n\n1980 - David Bowie opened on Broadway as The Elephant Man.\n\n1997 - A court ruling in France awarded more than $30,000 to a French citizen after he lost his hearing when he stood too close to loudspeakers at a U2 concert four years earlier.\n\n2004 - Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone (John Cummings) died in Los Angeles after a five-year battle with prostate cancer.\n\n2014 - Apple released a tool to remove U2's album, Songs of Innocence, from its customers' iTunes accounts six days after giving away the music for free. Songs of Innocence was meant to be the biggest album launch in history, and on Sept. 9, 2014, it was immediately gifted to all of Apple's iTunes customers worldwide (more than 500 million people).
