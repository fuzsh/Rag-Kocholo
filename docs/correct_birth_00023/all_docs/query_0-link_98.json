        "text": "Cleveland County, Arkansas, native Johnny Cash was the subject of the Oscar winning film Walk the Line. Although he never lived in Little Rock, he was a frequent visitor throughout his career.\n\nBorn on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, as a young boy he moved with his family to Dyess. After service in the military (in which he also had his first band), Cash moved to Memphis. It was there he broke into the music scene.\n\nAmong the venues Cash played in Little Rock were Barton Coliseum and Wildwood Park for the Arts. On more than one occasion, he shared the stage with his friend and fellow Arkansan Glen Campbell. The largest crowd for which Cash performed in Little Rock was in 1989, when he appeared at a Billy Graham crusade at War Memorial Stadium.\n\nHe is a character in the musical Million Dollar Quartet which the Arkansas Rep is producing later in 2019."
