        "text": "(1932–2003). In 1966 his concert in Liverpool, England, broke an attendance record set by a popular local band, the Beatles. American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash sparked a renewal of interest in country music with his simple, yet powerful songs.\n\nCash was born in Kingsland, Arkansas, on February 26, 1932. His family was poor, and he had to work from a young age. Influenced by the southern musical tradition, Cash learned to play the guitar and was writing and performing songs by the end of high school. He served in the U.S. Air Force and then in the mid-1950s settled in Memphis, Tennessee, where he formed a group, Johnny and the Tennessee Two, that got a recording contract in 1955. By 1957 songs such as “Folsom Prison Blues” and “I Walk the Line,” both of which Cash wrote as well as performed, made him the top recording artist in country music.\n\nHis popularity wavered somewhat in the 1960s, largely because of personal problems that included drug dependency. However, by the end of the decade he had married singing partner June Carter and had overcome his difficulties. He consequently won an even larger audience, as evidenced by his 1969 gold records, the albums Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison and At San Quentin and the single “A Boy Named Sue.”\n\nCash acted in films, hosted a television series from 1969 to 1971, and produced religious albums and a film. He was elected to both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He died in Nashville, Tennessee, on September 12, 2003."
