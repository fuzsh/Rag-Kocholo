        "text": "June 3, 2024\n\nWASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed H.R. 7180, legislation sponsored by Congressman Bruce Westerman (AR-04) to designate the post office in Kingsland, Arkansas, as the “Kingsland ‘Johnny Cash’ Post Office.” Westerman released the following statement:\n\n“The unanimous passage of this bill is a testament to the legacy Johnny Cash left behind through service to his country, his iconic music, and the deep impact he and his family have had on the Natural State.”\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOn February 26, 1932, Johnny Cash was born in Kingsland, Arkansas.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, Cash grew up working in cotton fields in Northeast Arkansas with his family.\n\nHis journey with performing started with high school assemblies and on KLCN, a local Arkansas classic radio station.\n\nCash joined the U.S. Air Force in 1950 and served in Germany for four years, where he wrote his hit classics, “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Hey Porter.”\n\nFollowing his service, Cash settled in Memphis to pursue his music career but never forgot his roots in Arkansas.\n\nThirty years ago, in 1994, Johnny and his wife June, son John, and all his then-living siblings attended the Kingsland Post Office dedication. With nearly 3,000 people in attendance, they performed the song “Will The Circle Be Unbroken.” Cash closed by saying, “This has probably been the best day of my life. I love you, and I love Kingsland.”\n\nThis fall, a statue of Johnny Cash will be unveiled in the U.S. Capitol building."
