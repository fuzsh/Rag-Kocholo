        "text": "Each town has something that draws people, and for the town of Kingsland, Arkansas, that's Johnny Cash.\n\nThe town of 500 is the birthplace and childhood home of the Man in Black. The town's tourist spot is the Johnny Cash's Birthplace, and the town has adopted a silhouette of him on their water tower.\n\nIt was a nice gesture and something else to see, especially this week. It seems that someone with a good shot and has perfectly placed bullet hole in the town's water tower.\n\nThe silhouette's leak was noticed on Tuesday, which officials found looks like Cash is taking a break from the stage and is taking a looooooooong leak.\n\n“Somebody shot our water tower, shot the silhouette of Johnny Cash in a very sensitive area,” mayor Luke Neal told KARK. “It’s been leaking for the last almost week.”\n\nIt quickly has gone viral, with people driving to the town just to laugh at what seems to just be a prank.\n\nWhile it is hilarious, the effects of the water tank having a hole are not. Nearly 30,000 gallons of water are flowing onto the ground beneath. Wasted water, but also a negative impact on residents.\n\n“People can look for their water to be discolored,” Neal said. During the repairs, the town's water supply will switch to a water line. Water pressure also could be affected.\n\nThe town is losing around $200 in water a day, with around a $5,000 bill expected to come from the repair job.\n\n“It might seem small in bigger places,” Neal said of the cost, “but for here it’s a pretty large number.”"
