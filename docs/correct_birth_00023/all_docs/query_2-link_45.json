        "text": "Growing up, John Carter spent nearly as much time on the road with his parents as at home with them in Hendersonville. He learned to play from true masters of the craft, including at the knee of his grandmother, world-renowned guitarist Maybelle Carter, and has released three critically-acclaimed solo albums since the early 2000s – Bitter Harvest, The Family Secret, and We Must Believe In Magic.\n\nCash is perhaps best known, however, as an accomplished record producer, work he began on his mother June Carter Cash’s LP, Press On, which won the 2000 GRAMMY Award for Best Traditional Folk Album. He then worked with Rick Rubin as Associate Producer on his father Johnny Cash’s American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002). The former won the GRAMMY Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance; the latter won CMA Awards for Album of the Year, Single of the Year (“Hurt”), and Music Video of the Year (“Hurt”), GRAMMYs for Best Male Vocal Performance (“Give My Love to Rose”) and Best Short Form Video (“Hurt”), and has been certified 1.5x platinum. Since then, John Carter has produced hundreds of recordings for dozens of artists, including Sheryl Crow, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, and Vince Gill.\n\nJohn Carter Cash has had success as a film actor and producer, as well, and as an author – including three childrens’ books, a novel, a cookbook of family recipes, a biography of his mother, and a memoir of his relationship with his father.\n\nMy father’s legacy in music is: Be who you are. Don’t try to be like anybody else –because that’s who he was; he was unique. And it’s that spirit of honesty, a spirit of being able to expose yourself, to show your frailties and your weaknesses, but not lose your honor and not lose your strength because of admitting your frailty. And that’s why the music survives. It’s because of that interior honesty, because of Dad being willing to expose himself, that we find such relation to that music."
