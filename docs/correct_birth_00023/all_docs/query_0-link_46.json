        "text": "By News Staff on Wednesday, February 22, 2023\n\nExhibit Photo Courtesy of Arkansas Secretary of State\n\nLITTLE ROCK - The current Post Office Exhibit located on the main floor of the Capitol Building includes photos of Johnny Cash at the Old Kingsland Post Office along with his friend, Johnny Horton, in May 1959 while they were visiting the area on a fishing trip. “The exhibit does a great job of showing a visual history of the Post Offices of Arkansas and their place in Arkansas History,” said Wayne Cash. Johnny Horton’s song “Battle of New Orleans,” that was written by Jimmy Driftwood of Mt. View was the number one song in the nation during this time and would go on to be the 1959 song of the year. Following in July, 1959, Johnny Cash, released his song “Five Feet High and Rising.” Also included in the exhibit is the 1994 Johnny Cash dedication of the New Kingsland Post Office. The event included an Official Post Office Cancellation Stamp for Kingsland being the Birthplace of Johnny Cash. The Post Office called the Cancellation Stamp “Johnny Cash Station” celebrating his birthplace and connection to the railroad that runs through Kingsland and the county. The cancellation stamp included “Old 819” that was recently designated by the Arkansas Legislature as Arkansas’s Official Steam Locomotive. Johnny Cash’s Birthday is Febniary 26 and is designated by the Arkansas Legislature as “Johnny Cash Day” in Arkansas.\n\nTo access content, please login or purchase a subscription."
