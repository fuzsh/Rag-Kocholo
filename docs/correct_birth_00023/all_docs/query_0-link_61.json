Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Much of Cash’s music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname “The Man in Black”.\n\nCash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\n\n#bobdylan #JohnnyCash #keithrichards #brianjones #charliewatts #jimihendrix #blues #bluesman\n#direstraits #markknopfler #bbking #garymoore #ericclapton #bobdylan #buddyguy #neilyoung #ledzeppelin #pinkfloyd #gunsnroses #thebeatles #thedoors #stevierayvaughan #slash #rockhistation #therollingstones #johnnycash #chuckberry #davidbowie #frankzappa #rocknroll #garymoore #nickcave \n\nvia: @ucoofficial @rockhistation @johnnycash \n\nHappy Birthday Johnny Cash!\".",
