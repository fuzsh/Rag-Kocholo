        "text": "This is the craziest thing you'll hear all day. No, it's not the 1930s, but Johnny Cash and June Carter were just born. But wait, there's more.\n\nThis country music coincidence just happened in Alabama. On April 10, a June Carter Clark was reportedly born just down the hall from Johnny Cash Davis at Huntsville Hospital in Alabama.\n\nBabies Named Johnny Cash + June Carter Born at Same Hospital, Same Day\n\nBefore the children were born, nobody had a clue that this coincidence was about to be upon them. Once the two babies were born and the paperwork was filled out, word started to spread internally at the hospital that Johnny Cash and June Carter were just born.\n\nThe mothers of the babies, Sophie Clark, 22, and Nicole Davis, 44, spoke with FOX Television Stations explaining they just had to meet one another once hospital workers told them about the coincidence.\n\n\"I was so excited when I heard,\" Clark told FOX. \"I told my husband and family that I had to go find this baby.\"\n\nBoth moms said the names were selected partly in homage to the famous musicians, but they were also family names.\n\nThe big question that everyone had was would the babies and parents be staying in touch now that they have this forever link.\n\nThe answer, in short, is yes. \"We plan to take the babies to Nashville to get some pictures at the Grand Ole Opry, where the real Johnny and June met,\" Clark said. \"These sweet babies will have a story to share forever now.\""
