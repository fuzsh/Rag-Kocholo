Donna Summer is the Queen of Disco. Within a genre that sprouted anonymous voices, Summer, who died on May 17, 2012, was prolific, versatile, and determined.

Pushing boundaries, she symbolized a time that her work transcended. Her influence, from Madonna to Beyonce, from the invention of the twelve-inch to the whole of modern EDM, is immeasurable.

She was no producer’s puppet: Her association with the production team of Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte was one of collaboration, as she cowrote eight of her fourteen Top Ten pop chart singles. A ninth, “Dim All the Lights,” she wrote on her own.
