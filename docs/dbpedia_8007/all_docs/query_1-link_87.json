        "text": "Started out good, working out bad....\n\nBy the mid-1980, Donna was the hottest thing going in music. She had just come off of back to back to back hit albums (Live & More, Bad Girls, and On The Radio) and a streak of top 10 hits that was unprecedented for a female artist at the time. But change was in the air. Disco was on the way out and Donna was growing increasingly dissatisfied with her relationship with Casablanca Records.\n\nEnter David Geffen.\n\nAt the time, Geffen was starting up a new record label. After a little legal tap dancing, Donna became the first act to sign on board. Donna's first release for the fledgling label was an album that was more rock-oriented than anything she had put out previously. That album was called The Wanderer, and in a glowing review Rolling Stone called it \"Summer's finest LP.\"\n\nUnfortunately circumstances conspired against The Wanderer. A strong disco backlash coupled with the \"white boys club\" of rock radio made it virtually impossible for any Donna Summer record to be played on rock radio. And many disco fans were taken off guard by Donna's new style. So although the lead single went gold, and the album made #13 on the Billboard album chart, The Wanderer was not the run away success that Donna's previous albums had been. This, unfortunately, set the stage for Donna's remaining years at Geffen Records. Even so, The Wanderer was critically acclaimed and remains a favorite of many fans. So this month I invite you to relive The Wanderer."
