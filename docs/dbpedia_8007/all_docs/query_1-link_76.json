        "text": "IN 1975, a 26-year-old singer who called herself Donna Summer floated onto the scene with “Love to Love You Baby.” Produced by the Italian disco pioneer Giorgio Moroder, it became a sensation, 17 minutes of a woman oohing and aahing as if in a state of ecstasy.\n\nFor the next half a decade, there almost wasn’t a nightclub in America that didn’t play Ms. Summer’s songs or anyone who came of age during the disco era who won’t forever associate her with that hedonistic time.\n\nOn Thursday, after news of Ms. Summer’s death, some of the last remaining denizens of the legendary New York dance clubs Studio 54, the Paradise Garage, 12 West, Flamingo and Xenon recalled their fondest memories of dancing to Donna Summer. At least, as much as they could remember.\n\nJellybean Benitez, D.J. and executive producer at “Studio 54 Radio,” at Sirius XM “You had this woman moaning and groaning, like she was having an orgasm. And it went on forever. But no one seemed to mind. You’d just play that record and turn the lights off. Seventeen minutes was enough time to fulfill a lot of fantasies.”\n\nPatricia Field, clothing designer and stylist “Her music embodied that era. Dancing and drugs, it all went together like a beautiful salad. I was never that heavy a drug user. But poppers I used to enjoy when I was on the dance floor shooting for the stars. I was having a mad love affair with a woman named Dorothy that lasted a year and a half. We’d go to 12 West together and dance and get lost. We loved ‘Love to Love You Baby.’ ”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
