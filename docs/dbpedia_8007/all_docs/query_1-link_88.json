        "text": "A lost song from the late Donna Summer is to be released ahead of a ‘new’ album.\n\nThe song, You To Me (Oliver Nelson Remix), is the second single to be taken from I’m A Rainbow – Recovered & Recoloured, a 10-track album which completely re-imagines Donna Summer’s ‘lost’ 1981 LP I’m A Rainbow mixed by a host of international producers; Junior Vasquez, Le Flex, Figo Sound, Jean Tonique, Ladies On Mars and Oliver Nelson – who has just signed to Atlantic Records – have all added their touch.\n\nForty years ago this September Donna Summer’s new album I’m A Rainbow, produced by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, was weeks away from being released. During 1981 the musical landscape was changing, production techniques were developing and Summer’s label wanted a more R&B-influenced album and took the decision to withdraw the album just before its release.\n\nIt languished in the Geffen vaults until it was eventually issued in 1996 as an 18-track CD with no fanfare at all.\n\nFast-forward to 2021 and I’m A Rainbow has received a fresh coat of paint.\n\nAlbum curator Michael Neidus on this second track to be taken from the album: “You To Me has always been my favourite song from the album but have always wondered how it would sound slightly more up-tempo. Whilst in Los Angeles in 2017, I kept hearing this cracking dance track over the poolside speakers. ; it was a remix by Swedish producer Oliver Nelson, of Habits (Stay High) by fellow-Swede Tove Lo.\n\n“It had been a UK Top 10 hit but somehow I had completely missed it. I kept hearing Oliver’s remix, then discovered his other work and knew that I’d want him to work on a future project; You To Me just seemed the right track. He delivered a great version, respecting the original but adding new elements to it and giving it a little more pace. I suggested to remove the original intro and introduce a drum rise, which he did and it gave more impact to the start of the track, especially stylistically in a Love Unlimited vein. Within two seconds its warmth made it sound like an old and familiar friend.”\n\nYou To Me is available now with I’m A Rainbow – Recovered & Recoloured following on 8 October.\n\n‘I’M A RAINBOW – RECOVERED & RECOLOURED’\n\nCD TRACKLISTING\n\nI’m A Rainbow [Junior’s Shiny Rainbow Remix]\n\nI Believe (In You) [Figo Sound Version] – duet with Joe ‘Bean’ Esposito\n\nBack Where You Belong [Jean Tonique Remix]\n\nYou To Me [Oliver Nelson Remix]\n\nDon’t Cry For Me Argentina [Ladies On Mars “Buenos Aires” Remix]\n\nSweet Emotion [Le Flex Remix]\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Remix]\n\nRomeo [Ladies On Mars “Luv NRG” Remix]\n\nHighway Runner [Ladies On Mars “Street Race” Remix]\n\nLeave Me Alone [Ladies On Mars “Independence” Remix]\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Remix-Radio Edit]\n\nI Believe (In You) [Figo Sound Radio Version]\n\nHighway Runner [Ladies On Mars “Street Race” Extended Mix]\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Extended Remix]\n\nRomeo [Ladies On Mars “Luv-NRG” Extended Remix]\n\nLP TRACKLISTING\n\nSIDE ONE\n\nI’m A Rainbow [Junior’s Shiny Rainbow Remix]\n\nI Believe (In You) [Figo Sound Version] – duet with Joe ‘Bean’ Esposito\n\nBack Where You Belong [Jean Tonique Remix]\n\nYou To Me [Oliver Nelson Remix]\n\nDon’t Cry For Me Argentina [Ladies On Mars “Buenos Aires” Remix]\n\nSIDE TWO\n\nSweet Emotion [Le Flex Remix]\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Remix]\n\nRomeo [Ladies On Mars “Luv NRG” Remix]\n\nHighway Runner [Ladies On Mars “Street Race” Remix]\n\nLeave Me Alone [Ladies On Mars “Independence” Remix]\n\nSIDE THREE\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Remix-Radio Edit]\n\nI Believe (In You) [Figo Sound Radio Version]\n\nHighway Runner [Ladies On Mars “Street Race” Extended Mix]\n\nSIDE FOUR\n\nBrooklyn [Ladies On Mars “Child Of Rhythm” Extended Remix]\n\nRomeo [Ladies On Mars “Luv-NRG” Extended Remix]"
