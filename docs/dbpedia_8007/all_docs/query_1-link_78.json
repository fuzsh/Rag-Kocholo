        "text": "Donna Summer’s estate has accused Kanye West of copyright infringement over one of the songs from his recently released collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1. The estate claims the rapper asked to use one of the late singer’s songs, and despite not getting clearance for it, he used it anyway.\n\n“Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song ‘I Feel Love,’ he was denied… He changed the words, had someone re-sing it or used AI but it’s ‘I Feel Love’… copyright infringement!” an Instagram Story posted on Saturday from the official Donna Summer account handle reads.\n\nThe Vultures 1 song “Good (Don’t Die),” features the lyric “Oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive, oh” with a melody and cadence that appears to be the song the estate may be referencing.\n\nA rep for West did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.\n\nThe Summer IG account tagged Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Warner Chappell Music, Universal Music Group, and Sharon Osbourne in its post. A day prior, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne made a similar accusation. “Kanye West asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of ‘Iron Man’ from the Us Festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many,” the singer wrote in capital letters. “He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”\n\nTrending\n\nOsbourne’s manager and wife Sharon Osbourne added later on Friday that “We are considering legal action.”"
