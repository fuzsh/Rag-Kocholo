        "text": "That’s the one to read! The author was there from day one. Absolutely fascinating look inside Casablanca. All the ways they would rob Peter to pay Paul. Great fun if you bought a lot of music from 1974-1980. Casablanca put out an awful lot of music I listened to back then, my high school years. A must read for anyone even a little familiar with the label. Can’t wait to see the film, thanks Chris!\n\nMe too. They were great days. The 70s really was a fantastically diverse era for music when you look back from today's perspective. So much of it has stood the test of time! Looking forward to this.\n\nEven that trailer takes great liberties with story line and facts.\n\nIs this a film about Casablanca Records? If so, then why include stuff related to Neil Bogart's previous label, Buddah?\n\nThe Isley Brothers were never signed to Casablanca. They weren't even signed to Buddah. Their own T-Neck Records had a distribution deal with Buddah for a time. While they had some success during that era (most notably the song featured in this trailer -- albeit in a re-recorded form -- \"It's Your Thing\"), their major hit making era began after the Isleys signed a deal with CBS.\n\nI know that these pseudo biopics have been very popular lately, but I cannot think of one that I enjoyed in its entirety. When a film that's supposedly telling the story of an artist or group (or in this case, a record label) distorts the truth so much that I am repeatedly taken out of the story telling into thinking, \"That isn't right,\" then the film fails for me.\n\nWhile I appreciate movies like this they also propogate myths, half-truths, and just out and out made-up parts that people accept as truth.\n\nSpinning Gold The Official Soundtrack features vibrant new performances of pop classics from Buddah, Casablanca, and Motown Records that celebrate the storied career of record man Neil Bogart. Performed by today’s stars including Jason DeRulo, Wiz Khallifa, Ledisi, Jeremy Jordan, and introducing Tayla Parx, and more covering timeless classics from Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls” to Kiss’ “Beth.” The collection also includes two original tracks exclusive to the film, “Cherry on Top” and “Greatest Time.”\n\nSide One\n\n1. “Shout It Out Loud\n\nPerformed by Sam Harris and Casey Likes\n\n2. “Love To Love You Baby”\n\nPerformed by Tayla Parx\n\n3. “Cherry On Top”\n\nPerformed by Jeremy Jordan\n\n4. “It’s Your Thing”\n\nPerformed by Jason Derulo\n\n5. “One Toke Over The Line”\n\nPerformed by Alec Benjamin\n\n6. “Ain’t No Sunshine”\n\nPerformed by Pink Sweat$\n\nSide Two\n\n7. “Midnight Train To Georgia”\n\nPerformed by Ledisi\n\n8. “Rock And Roll All Nite”\n\nPerformed by Sam Harris and Casey Likes\n\n9. “Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)”\n\nPerformed by Wiz Khalifa\n\n10. “Beth”\n\nPerformed by Alex Gaskarth\n\n11. “Bad Girls”\n\nPerformed by Tayla Parx\n\n12. “Last Dance”\n\nPerformed by Jeremy Jordan and Tayla Parx\n\n13. “Greatest Time”\n\nPerformed by Jeremy Jordan and Cast\n\nOh please. No one is going to want remakes of those tracks. Will labels ever learn!? And including Buddha, despite the observation made above (fair if one isn’t familiar with Neil’s career) is very relevant if you are. It helps clarify some of his actions at Casablanca. And why he thought he could get away with a lot of them. Which he did for a long time. But the fact they couldn’t even clear the licenses for the real music, or were too cheap to, makes me very dubious of the authenticity of this production. But Casablanca was a big soundtrack to my life, just behind RSO Records, that I’ll have to go see it. Luckily I know most of the real story already so I’ll just go to have some fun."
