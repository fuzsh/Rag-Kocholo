        "text": "Donna Summer is always the most favorite of summer disco parties worldwide with her eternal hits like “Hot Stuff”, “Bad Girls”, “Last Dance”. “MacArthur Park”, “She Works Hard for The Money” and many more. She is the Queen of Disco nobody else can claim even in the future. Her songs keep making the summer parties hotter.\n\nDonna Summer is also necessary to discuss the entire music history. She is the artist who built the 70’s disco boom and culture with millions of record sales and inspired many fans all over the world. She still does. I witnessed that many young generations, who weren’t familiar with the height of Donna Summer’s career, enjoyed dancing to her tunes at the outdoor social distance dance parties in New York City this year. Unfortunately, Donna passed away in 2012 at the early age of 63, but her legacy and masterpieces are forever as well as her powerful vocal performance and high-standard creativity.\n\n*****\n\nUnlike her impression as a summer girl comes from her last name which was adapted from her first husband’s surname (Sommer) and her hot dance tunes heat up party gores, the reality of Donna Summer was a winter girl from a cold northern cultural city. Before being Donna Summer, she was LaDonna Adrian Gains born on New Year’s Eve of 1948 in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up there until 17. Founded in 1630, Boston is the origin of U.S. history, culture, and modern development as one of America’s oldest cities. Boston has many of America’s firsts and historic establishments. Boston will celebrate its 400th anniversary after 10 years, and the oldest urban in the U.S. still takes an important role as one of the leading business centers in the country. Boston is also an important city in African American history many great leaders fought for freedom before the Civil War, including the Underground Railroad and the abolitionist movement. Just like it’s impossible to discuss music history without Donna Summer, it’s impossible to discuss U.S. history without Boston. Donna Summer’s youth spent in a rich cultural environment influenced her musicianship.\n\nI love Boston. I love Boston’s culture, heritage, atmosphere, beautiful historic architecture, wonderful people, delicious food, and many more. I’ve visited Boston more than 20 times but never, ever got bored. The historic city’s mature atmosphere always relaxes me.\n\nSo I’d like to introduce this beautiful city of Boston from a different angle other guidebooks don’t write; the passage of young Donna Summer from her birth to leaving for her dream just before her high school graduation with introducing some of Boston’s black historic sites nearby.\n\nDonna Summer published her autobiography, “Ordinary Girl”, in 2003. This book covered pretty specifics about her youth in Boston. I walked all over Boston with this fantastic autobiography in the summer of 2020. I am confident that this biographical guide is a good opportunity for her fans to discover the deeper aspects of Donna Summer’s life with more respect for her music as well as suggesting a new style of travel.\n\nNOTE: I stayed in Boston for research and photo shoots between July 15 and 22, 2020. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was in Phase 3 of the reopening process after COVID-19 and started allowing visitors from New York State on July 1 (I live in New York City). I thought much about visiting Boston after the pandemic but decided to pursue my trip as a healthy individual. Spending money in Boston could also be my support for Boston’s local businesses during a difficult time. As a result, I had an amazing safe trip while following the local safety rules.\n\nPlease note that many sites were still closed to the public when I visited so interior photos were pretty much limited as a result of respecting the guidance.\n\nAll photos were taken by me except a few indicating the note. Many photos are enlargeable by click.\n\n↓ CLICK #2 TO READ THE MAIN ARTICLE"
