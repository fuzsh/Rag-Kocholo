        "text": "leecappella said:\n\nAs a full blown Donna Summer fan, I was disappointed to hear that there was a Donna Summer cd that did not get released back in 1981. If it was out there, I wanted to hear it. If I didn't like jazz and she released a jazz cd, I would want to hear it. I then would likely start liking jazz. I love just about anything this woman does. So, when I'm A Rainbow was finally released, I could not wait to hear it. I like just about every track on I'm A Rainbow. My least favorite would be To Turn The Stone followed by, I Need Time. These two I listen to the least. My favorite tracks are True Love Survives, You To Me, Leave Me Alone, Melanie, A Runner With The Pack, Highway Runner, and Romeo. All the others, I like. I just don't listen to them to the degree that I listen to my favorites. If singles had been released from this cd, my choices would have been any and all of my favorites. David Geffen was not pleased with I'm A Rainbow. This was probably due to his expectations for Donna as compared to her success in the 70's. Her 80's releases weren't as successful. She Works Hard For The Money being the exception. Donna is a versatile vocalist, but that does not guarantee success. Whatever she may be asked to do by a record company, I'm sure she can deliver. However, as an artist, no one wants to have their songs shelved after they were inspired, created, recorded, and finalized in the mix. I would love for Donna to be able to do whatever she wants musically. As far as Geffen's decision goes, it was his right to do what he did. He owned the record company. It was a business decision. An artist is, in a sense, is owned by a record company. It can be tough. An artist is born, creates, dreams, and has a passion for their work to be heard. To get to the level major recording artists get to can be a dream come true. But there appears to be a price for a lot of those creative individuals. Donna's song, Be Myself Again speaks of one of those prices. David Geffen did what he thought he should have done. Who knows what kind of success I'm A Rainbow could have had back in 1981? It may have bombed. It may not have. Sometimes, though, for a singer/songwriter, it's more important to be able to record the songs one wants to. Donna was saying something with I'm A Rainbow. To have it shelved was probably like sharing your heart with someone and that someone showing no concern for what was being said to them. The album was disregarded. In turn, her feelings were disregarded on some level. Being the Donna Summer fan that I am, there is no album by her that I don't like. There are some songs that I don't listen to as much as others, but, as a whole, I love whatever she puts out. If it were up to me, David Geffen would have released I'm A Rainbow. However, because the songs were not as he would have liked them to be, he canned it. Never mind the fact that although he didn't like the album, it could have still done well commercially in its day despite his personal feelings concerning it.\n\nAnd, yes! I am still on vacation:)"
