        "text": "Donna Summer’s estate has sued Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign for copyright infringement over the unauthorized interpolation of the late singer’s “I Feel Love” on their song “Good (Don’t Die).”\n\nThe suit, filed in California on Tuesday, asserts that West and Ty initially asked for permission to sample and use parts of “I Feel Love” on “Good (Don’t Die),” and were explicitly denied. “Good (Don’t Die)” is included on the duo’s latest album “Vultures 1,” featuring a female voice singing altered lyrics to the melody of “I Feel Love.”\n\nAfter the release of “Vultures 1” in early February, Summer’s husband Bruce Sudano took to socials to publicly denounce the interpolation on the song. “@kanyewest asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” he wrote. Soon after, “Good (Don’t Die)” was removed from Spotify, yet returned this past weekend with different album art. As of now, the song has once again been made unavailable to stream on the platform.\n\nSudano is the main plaintiff in the suit, which claims that the estate rejected West’s request to clear the song’s use because of the rapper’s “controversial history.” Last month, an entity named Alien Music made the request to Summer’s estate on West’s behalf and submitted a clearance request to use excerpts. The estate denied clearance on Feb. 3, communicating the rejection in writing and twice over the phone. After the denial, Alien Music allegedly went to Summer’s label Universal Music Enterprises, which also denied usage.\n\nThe filing seeks to “recover compensatory damages, maximum statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and disgorgement of any profits.” The suit is requesting $150,000 for each act of infringement. Attorneys for Sudano write that the case is “about protecting Summer’s own musical legacy and one of popular music’s most influential and ground-breaking songs.”\n\nLawyers for Sudano and the Summer estate declined to comment, while an inquiry made to representatives for West went unanswered."
