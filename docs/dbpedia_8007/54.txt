Donna Summer

Biography

Donna Summer rocketed to international superstardom in the mid-1970s, working with producer Giorgio Moroder on a revolutionary sound that combined elements of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and avant-garde electronica, and helping to catapult underground dance music out of the clubs of the U.S. and Europe to the pinnacles of sales and radio charts around the world. A five-time GRAMMY® winner, Donna Summer was the first artist to win the award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (1979, “Hot Stuff”), as well as the first-ever recipient of the GRAMMY® for Best Dance Recording (1997, “Carry On”). In addition to her five GRAMMY Awards®, Summer earned six American Music Awards, three consecutive No. 1 platinum double albums (she holds the record as the only solo artist, male or female, ever to accomplish this), 3 platinum and 8 gold albums, four No. 1 singles on Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart, 3 platinum singles, and 9 gold singles. It is estimated that more than 150 million copies of Summer’s albums have been sold worldwide, and she is ranked at No. 31 on Billboard Magazine’s “Hot 100 Artists of All Time” (60th Anniversary issue). Upon hearing of her passing in 2012, a who’s who of entertainment, including many of her contemporaries (Bette Midler, Nile Rodgers, Deborah Harry, Duran Duran, Ian Schrager, Sheila E, and Gloria Estefan, among others) and artists she inspired (Questlove, Tom Morello, Katharine McPhee, Flea, Mary J. Blige, and Timbaland, among others), shared memories via media interviews and social media messages. In 2013, she garnered a well-deserved posthumous induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In 2018 her influence and music continued to reach new heights as Summer: The Donna Summer Musical opened on Broadway to overwhelming audience reaction night after night. Summer’s sultry, jubilant, and free-spirited songs are timeless anthems that continue to influence musicians from each new generation.
