SexyMandarin.com is an online service that teaches you Chinese. But there's a little more to it than that, as its name suggests. Its educational videos teach you about key mandarin phrases, but they also feature hot babes. Check out the example below which will instructs you how to ask the time in Chinese.

I already know the language so I can’t really tell if it would really be that helpful for language learners. But I it think it might be. It will definitely keep guys interested, right? The online videos are very well and professionally made. You can check out the behind the scenes pictures here. It’s seriously professional.

According to Thatsmags, the service was started in December of last year by Mick Gleissner, a German fashion photographer who is based in Hong Kong and his girlfriend, Kaoru Kikuchi, a Japanese fashion/jewelry designer and model.

Both of them enjoy learning Chinese but dreaded the usual boring approach to language instruction. The service does not look to be quite ready or fully launched, I think. Or I don't see a business model there yet, anyway. It's still a free subscription service. I bet the company must have invested a lot of money to create videos with such a high production value.

It’s an interesting approach to learning Chinese, especially for beginners. But I wonder whether sex and Chinese can be made into a full course curriculum, while ensuring learners actually understand the language well. But it will certainly be a stimulating experience, to say the least!
