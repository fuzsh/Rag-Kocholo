It's been good, casual experience; since I only put in a half hour on average a day, I'm not in any rush to become fluent.\n\nHowever, I would like to casually learn Mandarin. I know it's much more difficult than the other language I've been learning (which has similarities to English), but I'm in no rush to become fluent so it's okay if I struggle early on.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is something Android friendly that I can study for a few mins every day to work on learning Mandarin (that's the biggest reason I like Duolingo, it's easy to study from my phone). Does anyone have any recommendations as to where I can find a resource that fits this description, or any other tips for an absolute beginner to start learning this language?\n\nThanks!\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nPeking university offers an introductory class on coursera.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nhere you go\n\nhttps://www.sexymandarin.com/\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>59025909\n\nDon't know if you're still here, but you're looking for ChineseSkill\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>59025909\n\nI am afraid I cannot answer your question but perhaps someone can help in the /east asia/ thread.\n\n>>59028207\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>59025909\n\nSee >>59029803\n\nIm studying mando too.

One year studying it at a university mentally ruined me. I feel depressed and sometimes wish could die. You learn new characters and forget old all over again. As for tones, because it's a tonal language, you can learn them perfectly. But a lot of people have problems with them. And still the worst thing about Chinese is listening other speak. People often ask if saying this syllable in this word you mean the syllable that exists in a certain word, because this is the only way they can make sure this is what you're talking about, when words sound the same way. If you're not sure about it, don't waste time. Even you love the Chinese culture now, you will hate it within some time.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nI have been learning japanese for some time now, if I would like to start chinese should I go for traditional or simplified?"
