        "text": "I want to have more than 4 lessons per month, is it possible?\n\nA lot of students tend to rush through the course material and realize that they do not remember anything that they learnt. Our SexyMandarin teachers strongly advice our students to take our customized RECAP lessons after every 2 to 3 lessons to put the words and phrases into practice by conversing with our teachers.\n\nIs there a refund if I am not satisfied?\n\nWe have a cash back guarantee so that if you are not satisfied with our services, we will refund 100% of the money. However we try our best to provide the best services to our students and would appreciate if you could let us know what part of the lesson was unsatisfactory for you.\n\nWhat is the difference between COMMITTED and DETERMINED?\n\nDETERMINED is our best value. We can offer you more than 50% off the VALUE package. If you are serious about learning Mandarin, take this one and you will get double the amount of lessons from COMMITTED and one pack of poker cards where you would be able to play cards and learn Mandarin at the same time.\n\nI am not sure about which plan suits me the most, can you help me?\n\nWhen you have your free trial lesson with one of our SexyMandarin teachers, she will be able to figure out your level in this session and will send you a customized analysis of your level and suggested course that you are advised to take.\n\nI want to do my own program, do you have custom lessons?\n\nWe offer Private, group, and video lessons. Our SexyMandarin teachers would be happy to customize your studying style and needs for your satisfaction. Just let your personal SexyMandarin teacher know your thoughts and availability and she will go ahead and plan a custom lesson for you. However, if you have your favorite textbook you are comfortable with and wish to use this with our teachers, we would be happy scan these in and use it in our classroom."
