You’ll often wonder what language you should speak together, whether or not you should hold hands in public, and why she hasn’t uploaded any pictures of you to her social media profiles. Those were the easy parts.\n\nWhen you step through the front door of her relative's house down in the provinces, you will be warmly welcomed. Introduce yourself in Chinese. Everyone will be amazed, and then they will ask your girlfriend if you can speak Chinese. It will take awhile before they ask you any questions directly. Your answers will probably have to be re-stated word-for-word by your girlfriend before they understand. At some point during the introductions one of her uncles will say the transliterated version of Hello, “Hā luó!” Laugh, and tell him his pronunciation is perfect.\n\nYou will be offered something to eat and a glass of boiling water with loose tea leaves. Tell them you already ate, and put the glass on the table before your skin melts off. You will now go through an endless barrage of questions about your home country. If you are British, all of the questions will start with “Nǐmen Yīngguó…”. All of your responses should start with the phrase “Wǒmen Yīngguó…”.\n\nYou will be asked if Spring Festival is celebrated in your home country. Saying that the West stopped using the lunar calendar in the 16th Century might sound like a criticism of China’s 5,000 years of continuous development, so just say you celebrate Christmas. Chinese people are interested in organized religion, but China as a whole has never really gotten on the bandwagon. Purgatory must be crowded.\n\nHopefully you brought unique gifts from your home country, such as food items. Anything bought in China will not be considered expensive enough for their liking. There is no modesty in China, so try to avoid letting them see that you have a Nokia brick, not an iPhone. Do not mention that you flew on Spring Airlines. You should probably throw the airline luggage tags away before you get there.\n\nAt some point the Diaoyu Islands will be mentioned. (Next year it will be some other territory.) There are two options to deal with this. The first is to completely dodge the issue. The best way to do this is to say, “I love that band!” and start humming a tune. Confusion will ensue, and hopefully you can change the subject by talking about Jay Chow.\n\nIf drinking has already started when this issue comes up, you have an opportunity to start a round of competitive drinking. Raise a glass to Chinese sovereignty. Take a large gulp of baijiu, and then accuse the other male relatives of being pussies. Be sure to pick on one family member the entire time, offering to switch orange juice if he can’t handle alcohol. The goal is to have him be the first one to quit drinking.\n\nHere is a list of territorial disputes you can drink to:\n\n* Socotra Rock (中国苏岩礁, *Zhōngguó Sūyánjiāo*), “administered” by the Republic of Korea.\n\n* Spratly Islands (中国南沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Nánshā Qúndǎo*)\n\n* South Tibet (中国藏南, *Zhōngguó Zàngnán*), “administered” by India.\n\n* Macclesfield Bank (中国中沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Zhōngshā Qúndǎo*), claimed by the Philippines.\n\n* Paracel Islands (中国西沙群岛, *Zhōngguó Xīshā Qúndǎo*), claimed by Vietnam.\n\n* Scarborough Shoal (中国黄岩岛, *Zhōngguó Huángyán Dǎo*), claimed by the Philippines.\n\n* Trans-Karakoram Tract (中国喀喇昆仑走廊, *Zhōngguó Kālǎkūnlún Zǒuláng*), claimed by India.\n\n* Maritime Province (中国滨海边疆区, *Zhōngguó Bīnhǎi Biānjiāngqū*), “administered” by Russia.\n\nBy the time you get to the Paracel Islands, you should probably excuse yourself to go to the bathroom to vomit. You should do this multiple times throughout the night. You are outnumbered, and have no chance. When you get the idea that everyone is pretty drunk, declare that you hope there are no Japanese products in the house, because you are boycotting them. There will be a round of cheers, assuring you that they have all boycotted Japanese goods. Ignore the fact that you were picked up from the airport in a Toyota, the elevator in the building was made by Mitsubishi, the television that will be on all evening is made by Sony, all the kitchen appliances used to prepare the food were produced by Sino-Japanese joint ventures, and the poster in the oldest cousin’s room is of [Sola Aoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_Aoi) (SFW).\n\nDuring the dinner, only about 20% of the food will look appetizing. Half of that will be white rice, and the other half will be the dishes you can't reach. Eat everything you are offered, but spit it out into a napkin if it is inedible, like the chicken skull. Don't ask what it is called. You don't know the Chinese word for \"\"duck vagina,\"\" anyway.\n\nIf you have planned ahead, after the dinner you can use what I like to call \"\"fuck you treats.\"\" You know when a Chinese person offers you a piece of chicken with gristle, an artery, skin, and a jagged bone sticking out of it? That's a fuck-you-treat. A fuck-you-treat is something one culture finds appealing, but another culture does not. The Western World's most formidable fuck-you-treat is Blue cheese. Offer everyone a large piece, and then remark how good it smells. When everyone has reluctantly swallowed and is trying to keep it down, tell them how you let it sit on your balcony for three weeks before it got this good.\n\nAt some point in the evening, an uncle will produce a catalogue of the products produced by his company. He will be interested in doing foreign trade. Tell him you are intoxicated, but you know quality bicycle tires when you see them. Ask him about pricing on units in the millions. Tell him that is a damn good deal. Put the catalog in your backpack, and tell him you will give it serious consideration after the holidays. You know the phone number you used while studying abroad here that you still remember? Give that to him. It was an honest, intoxicated mistake.\n\nYou will notice you have not seen your girlfriend for a long time. The men and women have separated. The men are trying to see how much alcohol you can drink before dying, and the women are interrogating your girlfriend about marriage plans. Go find her.\n\nStumble into the room, sit down next to grandma, put your arm around her, and start acting like you have confused her with your girlfriend. This will either be met with laughter and the grandma will accept you, or you will never be invited back again. Both outcomes have their benefits.\n\nAt night, you will be told you are sleeping on the couch, or on an air mattress on the floor of a cousin's room. Bring extra warm pajamas for the night. Despite everyone in the family having an iPhone, they will turn off the heating at night to save a few yuan.\n\nHopefully you brought some snacks in your backpack, because you definitely did not get full from dinner. The next day will sort of just be a repeat of the first day, because you don't remember anyone's name, nor their relation to your girlfriend. \"\"Is she the *dàyí* or the *sānyí*? Shit.\"\"\n\nFrom then on you just act like a sport and take cues from your girlfriend. You only have to go through this for a few more days, at most. You can then use this experience of cross-cultural understanding against her when she refuses to wash your socks and underwear together.\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1360318693.0,,,True,t3_184ifa,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/184ifa/so_youre_going_to_your_girlfriends_hometown_for/,\n\n1365610348.0,358,self.China,1c2jdw,Prostitution in China,taotaotaotao,501,143,390,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1c2jdw/prostitution_in_china/,\"I feel like there's some interest in this. I'm sure it's going to be common knowledge to some, but I guess some others are completely ignorant of this entire world.\n\n*50 RMB: you have to be in a really podunk city, and find some back alley basement with nongmings. The women are prob like 40+ and completely disgusting.\n\n*100-150 RMB: BBS (which stands for barbershop). Full sex, one time, prob 20minutes ish, condom on. I think the name comes from fake barbershops that have a really bare \"\"fake barbershop\"\" first floor. It's super obvious bc there's like all of one chair, like no hair products, and just a bunch of skimpily dressed girls standing around. You then get led to the second floor for the sex. I don't see many of these anymore though. Now the telltale sign is pink lighting, and frosted glass doors. Often the frosted glass will have a clear strip so you can see the girls inside. They're typically sitting on a red couch doing absolutely nothing. Works the same way though. They're practically on every other street in every single city.\n\n*500 RMB: Outcall girls with agencies. When you sleep in a two star hotel and get stuffed those small notecards under your door, that's what you get. You text the guy what kind of girl you want, and she comes over in like half an hour. Full sex, prob 40ish minutes. The girls in general are pretty mediocre and look like they just got off work at the factory. You are technically allowed to turn her away at the door if you don't like her, but usually you gotta pay roundrip cabfare.\n\n*700 RMB: solo prostitutes. They do their own advertising, and you contact them on QQ. Just use google to find a forum for your own city, an you'll find reviews of various girls. Ofc, the reviews are written by themselves (ie advertisements). Ask for a picture, cam if you're lucky (but usually no cam), and ask for the rate. Don't bullshit around about getting to know them and shit. They don't want to waste time. If they do waste time, it means they're desperate for business and not in demand.\n\nOne pop, prob for about 20mins-60mins, depending on how much they like you. Anything goes if they really really like you. These girls are pretty good looking. They tout themselves as \"\"part time\"\", but we all know that's not the truth. It's some silly mythos of the poor university girl trying to become a doctor and being short on rent. They can be bitchy though, since there's no oversight agency.\n\n*600-1500: Sauna prostitutes. Any sauna building with a bright billboard and flashing lights, which is NOT a franchise chain, has these services. [Optional part: go in, shower, change out of your clothes and into their PJs, then hang around the communal level. There's TV, pool, food/fruit, drinks, movies. Also normal massages. Just chillax time]. When you're ready, you go to the hookers floor. A supervisor will greet you and ask you what kind of girl you want. I advise slipping him 50-100 RMB so that he brings you quality girls. They'll send anywhere from 3 to 20+ girls and have them line up in front of you. When they introduce themselves, see who is bubbly and makes eye contact, and who is dismissive. (Pick the former, obviously). Then you guys get to it. Specific rules will vary with the establishment. In general, you can either let them take the lead, or you can tell them what you feel like and orchestrate the whole thing (what's up let's get to know each other and chat, ok now i feel like having sex, ok now i feel like a blowjob, etc.)\n\n*1500-2500+: KTV prostitutes. Any KTV building with bright billboards and flashing ights, which is not a frnchise chain. You go in a room, and the whole supervisor interaction thing goes down. Then you guys can sing ktv and play drinking games. Groping optional, depending on how much she likes you and how strict the place is. Sitting fee (they chill with you, flirt with you, etc.) is usually 300 ish. Also gotta hit spending limit for the KTV room (500 RMB ish), and tip the DJ (person who operates the KTV system so you don't have to yourself) and shit for another 100-200. You can take them back to your hotel for one session (so like 3hrs) for an extra 700, or take them back for the night for 1000+. Anything goes if they really like you.\n\n10,000+: Be extremely rich and/or powerful. Anything goes, or you'll have everyone fired bc the owner is your bitch.\n\nThat's a reaaaally quick overview of prostitution in China. AMA I guess.\n\n**Edit for those who are offended**: I'm sorry that you are offended, but I'm not sorry for having offended you. You should have known better when you clicked on the thread. I only made this thread because /r/China has been talking about prostitution a lot lately. I hope you found the information interesting, even if you are against the practice. Common sense time: /r/China isn't JUST about prostitutes; China is not just about prostitutes; expats in China is not just about prostitutes.\n\n**Edit 3**: blanket response to some common objections\n\n* *\"\"You're supporting sex slaves.\"\"* Human trafficking *in regards to Chinese prostitutes in China* is greatly exaggerated. I've heavily cherry-picked my quotes. Please read the entire link to get the full picture.\n\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China#Prostitution_after_1978\n\n&gt;Over the past decade, there has been a recognition that the majority of women who enter prostitution do so of their own accord.[39][40] The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options. There also seems to be a growing acceptance of prostitution.\n\n* *Prostitutes are abused, coerced, pressured, etc.*: yes true.\n\n&gt;Apart from incidences of violence directly associated with prostitution, an increasing number of women who sell sex have been physically assaulted, and even murdered, in the course of attempts to steal their money and property.[47] There have also been a growing number of criminal acts, especially incidences of theft and fraud directed at men who buy sex, as well as bribery of public servants.\n\nAlso in this bag is any form of financial/psychological coercion.\n\nUnfortunately that is rampant across all industries in China. If you keep up with news in China at all, you should be aware of this. Yes, it probably happens more in this industry. I don't feel that I am condoning or supporting those behaviors. I still attended school (I'll only pass you if you sleep with me), I still eat at restaurants (I'll only hire you if you sleep with me), I still go to the bank (I'll only promote you if you sleep with me).\n\n* *\"\"Okay maybe you are nice to prostitutes, but others are not.\"\"* Yes, and I don't feel guilty about that. I also drink alcohol, even if there are abusive alcoholics.\n\n* *Everything you wrote is anecdotal only*: the whole \"\"well that's just your personal experience man\"\" is too commonly used. If I've visited a number of establishments in various cities, and talked to those girls and also chatted about their friends, that's a very varied sample group and not something to dismiss automatically. Everything I've read from the accounts of others to academic and professional reports on these things also line up with what I've said. If you have something to offer for the opposition, please link it.\n\n* *This is bad for /r/China*. One single thread should not and does not represent a whole forum, nor does it represent an entire group of people or a country of people. We can acknowledge and discuss a topic without condoning it.\n\n* *You are fat and lonely and can't get laid otherwise*: I mainly see expats picking up prostitutes in bars. I've never seen them in saunas. I see them in KTVs very rarely. 99% of customers I've seen are natives. People visit prostitution for so so so many reasons. They might be unattractive (physically or personality wise) and can't get the companionship otherwise. They might be out of town on business and can't put in the time to get laid the traditional way. They might be husbands who are tired of their wives. They might just be seeking the new experience for the thrill of it. They might be virgins who can't overcome their sexual anxiety. (And lastly, prostitution plays a huge role in business and government relationships. Not sure if this is true in other countries, but the other reasons all apply internationally). The more you know :)\n\nOkay I think that covers most everything... Except for that One-Child Policy argument, which was just completely LOL-level-wrong so I won't bother.\",,True,,t5_2qh2v,1365627845.0,,,True,t3_1c2jdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1c2jdw/prostitution_in_china/,\n\n1357798441.0,314,self.China,16au9e,\"Any wedding stories?

Not sure if anyone's actually interested in reading this- but it might prove useful or amusing to someone somewhere out there. I'll highlight three guys I've had the pleasure of seeing in my time in China- who are as follows:\n\n**The Controller, The Fu Er Dai, and Mr. Popular**\n\n---\n\n**The Controller**\n\nThe Controller was the first guy I dated here, who I started seeing not too long after I stepped off the plane into my 4-th tier university town. You can probably tell by the nickname I gave him that this particular story does not have even a remotely happy ending. A piece of advice to the ladies out there who are freshly-off-the-boat: be *very* fucking careful of who you see and who you trust when you first arrive.\n\nSee, there's special circumstances to consider when dating men in a new country and culture- especially when you don't know the language. If I had known more Chinese at that time- I probably could've saved myself a lot of trouble. When you first get here it's like you're trapped in a bubble. You have no support system, no friends, and no knowledge of what “proper” (according to Chinese culture) social interaction consists of. Your knowledge of the things happening around you is limited to how you perceive them through the “western culture” filter in your mind, and since there is a huge language/communication disconnect between you and everyone around you- the truth is *so* easy to manipulate.\n\nAs I got more and more fluent in Chinese, I slowly started realizing certain things didn't match up about my boyfriend. I eventually learned that he absolutely *loved* to lie. He'd lie about everything and anything- from big things, to things that didn't even matter. Sometimes he'd lie just to see if you were gullible enough to believe him. And when out with friends- he'd like to talk *for me*- put words into my mouth. Seemingly whatever words the listener wanted to hear the most. By the end of the night, he'd have every Chinese person at the party raving about how amazing and inspirational our “love story” is- even when his version of the story wasn't even half true. He would also constantly “mis-translate” things I would say- and when confronted about it- he'd claim it was an accident.\n\nHe also had me convinced that several of our mutual friends were no longer interested in hanging out with me. But of course, when I worked up the language skills to confront the friends myself- I learned that my boyfriend had told them it was *I* that wasn't interested in meeting with them. He had successfully cut off a large portion of my support network this way, and prevented me from making many friends. I guess guys like him just need a woman to control- and they see a FOB foreigner as perfect opportunity. Small support network- easy to manipulate because of the language barrier- and they can get away with almost anything and then blame it on “Chinese culture,” regardless of whether or not it actually is.\n\nSo piece of advice number 1- **learning Chinese** is absolutely paramount to successfully avoiding a situation like mine. And if you find your date “mistranslating” for you or encouraging you to rely on him to the point of being socially handicapped- take that as a huge red flag, and question everything he tells you from then on.\n\n---\n\n**The Fu Er Dai**\n\nThis guy was an almost comical caricature of every fu er dai stereotype there is. He loved everything western- luxury brands, cars, food, alcohol, and women. In the short time I was seeing him, he went through about 3 or 4 cars, bought closets full of brand name clothes, and seemed to be constantly jetting around the country, spending almost every other weekend in Shanghai. He was also the kind of rich where if he called you up and said, “Come over to my house,” you'd have to ask, “Which one?”\n\nBut the weird thing is- he was actually one of the best guys I've ever had the chance to meet. Not only was he honest, considerate and open-minded, but he was an absolute blast. He's the kind of guy a western girl could really relax around. He never made you feel self-conscious about speaking your mind, being loud, drinking beer, messily eating 串 by the roadside or smoking in a public place. And after doing so many things that would make you an irrevocable “bad girl” in the eyes of most Chinese- he'd tell you to “do whatever makes you happy” and not to care about the opinions of close-minded assholes. The two of us together could make almost any situation fun- grocery shopping, aimlessly driving around, taking a walk or exploring the city's deserted apartment complexes at midnight.\n\nI started dating him at the point where my Chinese was pretty good. Which is lucky- because he couldn't string a single fluent English sentence together and wasn't about to apologize for it. Although he could manage a “fuck you” every once in a while, and thought it was amusing to pull out a 100 RMB note and curse Mao ZeDong's portrait at the top of his lungs. Which brings me to piece of advice number 2- please **give the non-English speakers a chance**. Some of the nicest guys I know here also happen to be the ones that don't speak a lick of English. Remember The Controller from above? His English was excellent- and look where that ended up. Also, dating a guy with zero English skills is going to force you to learn Chinese at a light-speed rate, and that's never a bad thing.\n\nSo where did my relationship with Fu Er Dai end up? Well- he's a busy guy with a fast-paced life, and it just so happened that I didn't fit into it as well as we'd both previously thought. I was chained to whatever job or school gives me a visa- and he wanted to be able to do breakfast in Beijing and then lunch in Xi'An and come home just in time to hit the clubs.\n\nI never asked for or accepted a single material possession from him in our entire relationship- but before parting, he forced me to accept a gift to remember him by. Maybe I seem overly romantic about the notion- but the white jade bangle hangs on my arm in remembrance of the guy who taught me so much about living life and accepting yourself. So I say this in the most loving way possible- 下辈子见, you rich asshole.\n\n---\n\n**Mr. Popular**\n\nMr. Popular is my current boyfriend. I gotta say, he's a good guy. But goddamn- he is so fucking *popular*. Almost annoyingly so. Every time we walk around campus together- we bump into maybe 3 or 4 of his many friends within 15 minutes of heading out the door. Almost every night of the week he's outside eating or drinking with a different group of buddies, and he keeps himself very busy with university clubs, competitions, and activities.\n\nSo it seems great, right? He's charismatic, loved by practically everyone, his academic achievements will go down in our university's history, he's involved with many hobbies, and he has a huge support network and safety net. And last but not least- he's also slightly locally famous for dating *me*. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nAlmost everything could go wrong. See, he's an amazing guy- but he really jumped the gun on our relationship. Like many relationships with Chinese guys- ours developed at light-speed. We soon became the talk of the campus- and there was practically a waiting list of friends who wanted to meet me or take me out to dinner. And when word got around that I met his parents over Spring Festival vacation, it was considered by everyone to be serious. Like, on-the-fast-track-to-marriage kind of serious.\n\nSo what would happen now if I decided I didn't want to settle down at the tender age of 21? What if, like many young people, my priorities change and he no longer fits into my vision of my ideal life? Here's what will happen- I won't be able to get a job in this town ever again. There's something a little dangerous about dating a Chinese guy whose guanxi runs far and deep- and that's if he ever decides to punish you for leaving him or breaking his heart- he can make your life so miserable you'll have to flee for the next province over.\n\nSo the final tip- tip number 3. **Make sure your relationship is somewhat secret until you're absolutely sure you're serious about him.** Once it becomes “serious”- he is going to brag to every single friend and distant relative he has about his beautiful 爱情故事 of borderless love, sacrifice and overcoming hardship. That's a *lot* of people who now view you as some kind of angel and shining beacon of selflessness and morality. You now have the potential to disappoint a lot of people- and the second you decide maybe the relationship isn't going the way you want it- you revert back to foreign temptress up-to-no-good whore status. Times one thousand. And especially since if you can't speak Chinese- he has the power to spin the story any way he wants it and you can't tell them all otherwise.\n\nSo what to take away from this one? **Be very aware of the development of your relationship with a Chinese guy**- because it can go from “just friends” to “betrothed” before you even have time to notice it. Chinese social circles seem to be a lot bigger than western ones- and that's a lot of people who at best, will be disappointed at your break-up, and at worst, will vilify you. This is most true for those of us who live in small cities- in Beijing or Shanghai- you ladies are lucky enough to probably get a free pass on this one.\n\n\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1374093161.0,,,True,t3_1iidia,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1iidia/my_experience_dating_chinese_guys_and_some/,\n\n1371182601.0,210,newyorker.com,1gbg6o,\"“If Edward Snowden was Chinese and worked for the Chinese National Security Agency, Obama probably would already have had him to dinner at the White House and nominated him for the next Nobel Peace Prize.” Snowden's Chinese Fans\",beelzebee,247,37,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gbg6o/if_edward_snowden_was_chinese_and_worked_for_the/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_1gbg6o,http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2013/06/snowdens-chinese-fans.html#entry-more,\n\n1369870283.0,210,self.China,1favgc,\"Prospective Laowai here, seeking advice. I'm coming to China in August.\",ShrimpPizza,258,48,574,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1favgc/prospective_laowai_here_seeking_advice_im_coming/,\"First of all I'd just like to say a sincere thank you, since I've been lurking this subreddit for months and I feel as though I've learned a lot through it. I'm now humbly asking for some advice on my particular situation, which is this:\n\nI'm graduating with my BA this June. I'm sick of where I live, and I love to travel and want to work abroad for at least a year. I've been researching teaching ESL abroad and have decided that China is where I would like to go because it's such a diverse country, very historically and culturally rich and, because one of my best friends is currently teaching in Dalian and his experiences there have been resoundingly positive. His contract is up in September and we plan to travel together a while (2-3 weeks) before we go our separate ways and I settle down somewhere and start looking for work. I've saved up roughly $10,000 which should last a while and cover start up costs and all that.\n\nI've dealt with recruiters online, but from what I've read they just seem to be unnecessary middlemen and I should be able to find work on the ground. Am I correct in assuming so? I'm a native speaker (caucasian - I know this matters, it is what it is I guess..), with a Bachelor's Degree and from what I've read, that should be ample qualification to find a teaching gig. I'm hoping to find work in a \"\"2nd tier\"\" city, if my understanding of the tier system is correct - from what I've read and heard, Dalian, Nanjing, Qingdao and Xiamen all sound like awesome cities. I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up, given that I have no absolute set itinerary for travel, but I plan on visiting some of these places and connecting with the expat communities there and hearing some firsthand accounts of what it's like to live there before I make up my mind definitively. Is it realistic to expect to be able to find employment in said cities, given my limited experience? I have been volunteering through a local ESL program for the past six months to gain some classroom experience, but it isn't much, I know.\n\nI want to work legally, on a z visa, but I'll be coming to China on a tourist visa. From what I understand, I should be able, with a letter of invitation from a potential employer, to covert my tourist visa to a z visa via Bangkok or HK or possibly through Mongolia. Is this correct? I want to be patient and find a respectable employer to work for legally. I don't want to get roped into working illegally for a shady employer on a tourist visa. Ideally, I would like to work for ~20 hours a week. What do you suppose a reasonable salary to expect may be? I realize this answer depends largely on which city I'll be working in, but I'd like to make at least 6000RMB per month. Is this realistic?\n\nWhat do you think of my plan? I know I'm young and naive but I'm just looking for something different; I realize that living in China will have its challenges, but I refuse to be discouraged by some of the more cynical comments I've read on here and on other expat forums. I'm really looking forward to getting away, to traveling through a beautiful country, to dedicating my time to my interests and living humbly and for all of the interesting people I'll undoubtedly meet.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate any and all comments and critiques. Please don't be too hard on me.\n\n\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_1favgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1favgc/prospective_laowai_here_seeking_advice_im_coming/,\n\n1347782982.0,207,imgur.com,zyqc3,The Diaoyu Islands?,d9-thc,241,34,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/zyqc3/the_diaoyu_islands/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_zyqc3,http://imgur.com/2DRIC,\n\n1357891397.0,204,i.imgur.com,16dbv0,QQ users found one of most versatile image/emote ever: a hand holding a condom.,fall_ark,228,24,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/16dbv0/qq_users_found_one_of_most_versatile_imageemote/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_16dbv0,http://i.imgur.com/LLAUn.jpg,\n\n1354876110.0,195,imgur.com,14fso6,A gallery showing Chinese factory workers and the toys they make...,mod83,209,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/14fso6/a_gallery_showing_chinese_factory_workers_and_the/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_14fso6,http://imgur.com/a/wrIds,\n\n1362379043.0,191,i.imgur.com,19mjfw,\"Map of China with \"\"translated\"\" placenames (x-post from r/Mapporn)\",txQuartz,204,13,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/19mjfw/map_of_china_with_translated_placenames_xpost/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_19mjfw,http://i.imgur.com/4sIvT.png,\n\n1343126694.0,187,i.imgur.com,x2fkh,The expat in all of us.,zakbroman,205,18,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/x2fkh/the_expat_in_all_of_us/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,us,False,t3_x2fkh,http://i.imgur.com/iesN0.jpg,\n\n1361639959.0,188,i.imgur.com,1933md,\"smooth, beijing restaurant...\",fligs,209,21,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1933md/smooth_beijing_restaurant/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,europeanunion,False,t3_1933md,http://i.imgur.com/7jWIbFJ.jpg,\n\n1366755468.0,181,self.China,1cytne,\"Please don't upvote this, just a quick question.

I was frantically searching the web for information on this when I found out I was pregnant here and found next to nothing, so maybe my story can help someone or put another worried expat at ease.\n\nI found out I was pregnant while doing May Day vacation with my (Chinese) boyfriend in Beijing. I live and study in a small town in northern Shaanxi province, a tiny city where practically everyone knows me and my boyfriend, so in Beijing at least we could go to the store and buy a pregnancy test at Watson's without risking seeing someone we knew.\n\nWe did the test back at our hotel and it was positive.\n\nOur time in Beijing was running out and I accepted the fact that we'd have to wait to go back to our small, 4th tier city and get it done there.\n\nWe came back on a Friday night, and set out for the hospital the next morning. For those who are wondering about the specific hospital I went to, it was 榆林第一医院 in 榆林 city of Shaanxi province, and I highly reccomend it. Very modern, clean and (somewhat) professional.\n\nThe first order of business was to check in (挂号). We filled out a simple paper with my name, sex, age, and handed it to the clerk. She formatted and gave us a special card (looks like a credit card with a barcode) that electronically tracks the proceedures you do and the perscriptions you get. That was kinda cool. The check in proceedure is simple and any expat with basic Chinese skills can do it alone. The card and check in cost 10 yuan.\n\nNext we go upstairs and find the women's health/OBGYN area (妇产科). It's important to note at this particular hospital, there's a 2 hour period in the middle of the day where the doctors are off work. So the day is divided into two parts, morning and afternoon. I suggest checking out the hospitals hours or calling beforehand to find out when you can see a doctor, because waiting in the OBGYN area for so long was a little awkward, especially when all the Chinese people around are going to be asking you questions/trying to talk to you/find out why you're there.\n\nWhen all the doctors got back from lunch, we had to go into a small office where there were two doctors with computers. They're the ladies you go see and tell what you're there for and what you need. We told them I hadn't had my period in a long time, and they asked for specific dates and if I had any symptoms of pregnancy. After that, they typed up some things on the computer, scanned our card, and printed out a slip/form (单子) for an ultrasound. Before doing each procedure or test, you have to pay. So we paid downstairs, got a receipt, and took the receipt back upstairs to the ultrasound place.\n\nI'm not sure why they do ultrasounds to check for pregnancy rather than a typical pee test, but this way you can actually see the results instantly and it's kind of cool to watch the screen and see your insides. This is called a B超 or 超声.\n\nI waited my turn and went into the room. They had me unbutton my pants and tiny bit, squirted on some gel, and did the test. Just FIY, they have to press really hard to get a picture and it was a little uncomfortable, but it doesn't really *hurt*. On the screen, they highlighted a part which I suppose is the fetus, and confirmed I was pregnant, and then they printed out a page with two pictures of the results. The ultrasound cost around 60 yuan.\n\nAfter that, we had to report back to that little office from before. When we showed them the results and confirmed we wanted to terminate the pregnancy, they sent us off for more tests. Next up was an ECG (heart test) which they call 心电图. Like before, we got a slip they we took downstairs to pay with and then headed up to the testing room. I think you can see by now that there's a lot of running around in this process. The whole shibang takes an entire afternoon, so plan accordingly.\n\nThe ECG is my least favorite because you have to (partially) take off your shirt, bra, and expose your legs. I had forgotten to shave my legs that day so that was embarassing, but quite frankly the least of my problems at the time. It was a simple test that took less than 2 minutes and cost about 40 yuan. It's the same ECG test you probably got after applying for a job/to a university.\n\nWe ran back to the office and got another slip for the next test- a blood test. This cost about 65 yuan and was simple, the results only took 3 minutes to get. It's just a standard blood drawing thing. I noticed the lady who drew my blood wasn't wearing gloves though, and had my boyfriend mention that to her. She looked embarrassed and sheepishly said- \"\"Um... It's just easier to do without gloves.\"\" Um, okay.\n\nSo by this point we had done an ultrasound, ECG, and blood test. The final test was the worst part- the internal exam. I was led into a room with two gynocological chairs with a curtain between them. At your hospital it's likely similar, they have to get many people done in a short amount of time so they do it assembly-line style. My boyfriend couldn't come into this room with me so I had to communicate with the doctor myself, which really isn't a problem. She gave me a little blue sheet, told me to put it on the chair, remove ONE LEG of my pants and underwear then lie on the table.\n\nThere are a lot of girls going in and out of and around these rooms, but I was still a little shell shocked when I saw another girl (patient) basically walk in and decide to watch me take my pants and underwear off. I stood there looking dumb for a few minutes before the doctor caught on and told her to GTFO. So don't be surprised if there's very little privacy while getting your tests and exams done. This is China, afterall.\n\nAt this time there's another girl behind the curtain beside me and she's getting undressed too, but I make it onto the table first so the doctor inspects me first. I should mention now that I have never gotten a gyno exam in my life, so I was feeling really embarrassed and awkward. The doctor tells me not to be nervous and she pulls out a sterile, disposable, plastic speculum from its package.\n\nThe attitude and method they use while conducting this exam is similar to how some people feel that ripping off a bandaid as fast and as violently as possible will get it over sooner and with less suffering. So she shoves (there was actual shoving going on) the speculum into my vagina, wastes no time turning and then expanding it as fast as possible. Ow. Ow. OW. My eyes widen and I'm seconds away from complaining about the pain (I have a somewhat high pain tolerance, but this was pretty bad.) and then it's finally over, she pulls it out after mentioning it's all normal down there. The next step was to, as she put it, \"\"摸一下\"\" where she put two fingers inside me and pressed down onto my abdomen with the other hand. That wasn't pleasant either but it was leagues better than step 1. She 摸'd in 3 places, each time asking, \"\"疼不疼?\"\" to which I answered 不疼. Then it was over and I could finally get up and put my pants on.\n\nAs I was wrangling with my jeans and boots I could hear her move on to examine the girl next to me, who made a *very* vocal protest about the pain during her examination. I don't blame her, it wasn't fun, but the sounds she made sounded Japanese AV-esque and was really disturbing.\n\nSo with the last examination over we could go to the office again and get the final verdict from the two ladies. They looked over all the tests and said I was fit for an abortion.\n\nThere are two options. Medical abortion (药流) and surgical abortion (人工流产手术 which is abbreviated as 人流). Before you jump on it and immediately choose the medical abortion, like I wanted to, you should consider the facts. The lady told me that overall, the medical abortion only has an 80% effectiveness (not sure if that's true), sometimes causing incomplete abortions. Also there's a much longer recovery period and many nasty side effects like vommiting and nausea and excess bleeding.\n\nAlso it's not as if you can just take the medication and go home to abort in peace, the pill comes in two steps. You take pill number 1 first when at home, and then a day or two later have to come back to the hospital and take pill number 2 under the supervision of a doctor, who will watch you bleed out for what can be up to 3 hours. They have to ensure that the fetus is completely aborted so I imagine there's some inspecting of the stuff coming out of you going on.\n\nIt's not at all as pleasant or non-invasive as it seems at first. So I chose surgical abortion, the cost of which is 1500 yuan. When I made my boyfriend question the lady about anesthesia during the procedure, at first the lady wanted to write me up for a friggin' *epidural*. Apparently this option is cheaper than getting full anesthesia (going to sleep) so she figured that's the one we wanted. But I made a big fuss to my boyfriend about getting a needle in the spine so we got it changed to the full anesthesia. This part is *really* important. Make sure you're clear when selecting anesthesia options, because I was still worried even after going home about them accidently misunderstanding and changing it back to the epidural option, getting an injection in the spine is not something anyone looks forward to.\n\nSo the day is over, the appointment is set for Monday (they don't offer the surgical abortion service on weekends), and I get to go home. They told me to not eat or drink water the morning of the operation.\n\nThe morning rolls around and I go to the hospital bright and early. We have to walk around and find the doctor who for some reason wasn't in his office at the time (the only male doctor in the entire process you will meet is probably going to be the one who does the actual abortion). So we find him, talk for a bit, and he writes up a slip that we use to go pay. After payment we go up to the \"\"abortion theatre.\"\" It was a very nice, clean looking room with lots of equipment and everything was all ready for me. I take off one leg of my pants and underwear and mount the table. I was surprised that so many doctors (5 or 6) were present for the operation.\n\nI'm in the room without my boyfriend so I chat with the doctors while they're preparing. They put an IV drip in one hand and a heart moniter on the other. It was the first time they discovered I could actually speak Chinese so we all had a laugh while the female nurses compliment my skin tone and looks. They strap my legs onto the table, but the straps were soft and very elastic so it didn't feel confining or horror movie like at all. For some reason, at that point I wasn't scared or in a bad mood. The doctor puts a 氧气 (oxygen) mask over my face and turns on the IV drip with the sleepy stuff in it. My last words to the doctor before completely blacking out were \"\"瞌睡了...\"\"\n\nI woke up feeling very drugged and dazed. There were nurses struggling to put my underwear and pants back on and suddenly my boyfriend comes out of no where and picks me up and carries me to a bed on the other side of the room. I was half out of it and decided I wanted to get a pad from my purse and put it on, but I soon realized that the doctors had already put a thick wad of tissues into my underwear to catch the blood.\n\nAt that point, I felt no pain at all. In fact, it was really alright. I'd even go as far as to say it was nice. If you've gotten your wisdom teeth out, just imagine the feeling of waking up all happy and loopy in the dentist's chair. Not bad at all. Also, my boyfriend informed me that he had only been waiting a little more than *seven minutes* for the operation to be over. At first I didn't believe the doctor when he said it'd take less than 15 minutes, but it seriously does go that fast.\n\nSo a few minutes pass and I can finally stand. Still feeling good. We walk into the hall and find a place for me to sit while my boyfriend goes off and gets all the perscriptions filled. They give us two different antibiotics to prevent infection in the uteris and something called \"\"motherwart\"\" in English which supposedly helps \"\"replenish blood.\"\" Not sure about the effectiveness of the last one, but the doctors told me to take it, so I'll do it. After a total of half an hour I'm feeling pretty sober so we get a cab and go home.\n\nAnd that's it. So here I am now, sitting in my dorm, only a few hours after having had the abortion done and I'm not feeling bad or painful at all. Honestly the experience was not bad, despite being slightly panicked and worried throughout the process. I'll give some final important notes/tips for those who are considering getting an abortion done here in China.\n\n1. Bring a Chinese friend. Preferably a female friend that you trust. There wasn't much hard vocabulary I came across except the names of medicines and the description of the operation procedure. But you're going to want someone to give the doctor *clear* instructions about your choice of abortion method and the anesthesia option you want.\n\n2. Be aware of the time. The first day, you'll be doing a lot of tests and going back and forth between floors, paying and then running up to do various tests. For the test day, you'll need an entire afternoon. For the operation day, you'll need just a little more than an hour, with the actual procedure being less than 10-15 minutes. Get there early on operation day so you don't have to wait long.\n\n3. Bring a lot of money. It wasn't too expensive, but you won't want to be caught without enough to finish all your tests. The entire two days cost me about 2300 yuan, including the operation, perscriptions, tests and various other fees.\n\n4. The testing is way worse than the actual abortion. Seriously, I promise. The abortion itself is nothing to worry about and you will feel next to no pain at all afterwards. It feels kind of crampy and bloaty, just like a period that's slightly worse than normal. The testing process, however, was stressful, a little scary, and the internal exam was painful.\n\n5. You can't have sex for a *month* afterwards. At least that's what the doctors said, so I'm sticking to it. Also don't forget to take your perscriptions.\n\n6. My final piece of advice, *get the surgical abortion option*. It sounds scary at first, especially with the word \"\"surgical\"\" in front of it, but honest to God it wasn't a bad experience at all. I would much rather do this option than be all nauseous for days and have to bleed out for hours under the supervision of a doctor. Also the success rate is so much higher this way.\n\nSo that's it. I sincerely hope my retelling of my experience can help another girl like me who is scared of doing an abortion or similar procedure here in China. I hope someone can find this information valuable and wish you the best of luck. \",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_1ds29v,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ds29v/for_female_expats_looking_for/,\n\n1365690023.0,178,i.imgur.com,1c4w0g,'Why you should read more than one newspaper',mod83,194,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1c4w0g/why_you_should_read_more_than_one_newspaper/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_1c4w0g,http://i.imgur.com/8ygQdKe.jpg,\n\n1370310624.0,168,i.imgur.com,1fmgku,Duck Man,mod83,208,40,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1fmgku/duck_man/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_1fmgku,http://i.imgur.com/cnxdXZV.jpg,\n\n1358818648.0,169,imgur.com,170z7q,Chinese Is Easy - French vs. Chinese,nathandh88,200,31,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/170z7q/chinese_is_easy_french_vs_chinese/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_170z7q,http://imgur.com/UrW79vD,\n\n1375239419.0,165,self.China,1je9q1,\"As 1 of the 6 Chinese people on this sub, AMA.\",batia0121,208,43,705,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1je9q1/as_1_of_the_6_chinese_people_on_this_sub_ama/,\"I'm 22,born and raised in ShanDong.

The most racism I've ever faced in my life has been from Chinese people... Why?\",rescuerabbit123,181,38,415,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/12pe3d/im_black_my_academic_interest_is_in_china_my/,\"Hi. This may sound whiny... I've asked the same questions of my Chinese and Vietnamese friends, though I'm sure they are much less honest because of our friendship. I came here because I'd certainly like honest answers and maybe the anonymity of Reddit will give me that.\n\nSo I'm majoring in history and essentially Chinese studies in college. Multiple Chinese professors/ other Chinese students have made comments that they might have seen as nice, but were actually blatantly hurtful or racist. One professor wrote a very nice recommendation and ended it with Rescuerabbit 123 is one of the best African-American students I've taught. The implication clearly being that African-American students are different from other students and must only be compared with each other.... this is at least how I see it. One of my good friends said in all serious, \"\"You speak Chinese very well. That's really good considering most black people can barely speak English.\"\" My boyfriend is Chinese, mostly because we connect on academic interests and on an emotional level, but also I admit it might be because of my subconscious interest in both his home country's culture and history. His mother has said blatantly racist things about me to him and doesn't want me dating him because of both my class and race. She has told him that I'm only at our college because of affirmative action, asked him how he can find people like me attractive, alluded to the fact that I was aggressive because I'm black. His father likes me but on multiple occasions has commented on how other black people are lazy, stupid, or destroying America. This makes me seriously want to reconsider my major, my interests, often times my feelings for my Chinese friends. I have on many occasions experienced colorblind racism from white or even other black friends, but never such blatant, unapologetic disdain or racism toward blacks. I just want to know why.\n\nTL; DR I've faced a lot of blatant racism from Chinese people, moreso than from any other group, why is this?\n\nEDIT: So the actual racists of Reddit have come out now and this has devolved into me trying to prove something about black people... Sorry if I wasn't clear before as I'm getting some well deserved flak for this. The Chinese people who I have encountered who acted this way towards me were prejudiced... most likely they were not racists. My experiences with Chinese people are not accurate reflections of the Chinese populace as a whole so don't take them that way. Nevertheless other people have had similar experiences with prejudice from Chinese Americans and Chinese people in China, I'm sure people have also had significantly uncomfortable experiences with whites, blacks and other races as well. These are obviously not related to genetics, DNA, intelligence, or anything else that is inherent. We have pretty much concluded that these are learned behaviors... I will list some of the more popular conclusions later tonight. Thanks for contributing, giving me criticism, advice, and speaking your mind.\n\n\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1352305510.0,,,True,t3_12pe3d,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/12pe3d/im_black_my_academic_interest_is_in_china_my/,\n\n1362078440.0,143,imgur.com,19ets2,Jiuzhaigou: China isn't all big cities and pollution..

Fantasy,Sci-Fi. Only to amuse myself. Maybe one day they would be published. And I spend a lot of time online.\n\nEDIT3: Mostly we don't care or try to attend in local politics.What I know about their government is some names of ministers we have to contact with in business and the name of their president. My boss survived a riot in 2005 during the chaos caused by the death of former president. It's very scary according to his description.\n\nEDIT4: About myself. I love reading and wring fantasy and sci-fi. I am a fan of russian culture and literature. And of course I love American culture. The best fantasy and sci-fi is written by amricans. Hope one day I could travel to US.\n\nEDIT5:Something I am planning. Week ago I was suffering from depression. I feel better now but I don't think I would be completely well until I go back to China. But I was bonded by my job here that I can't leave for now until end of this year....I'm not a traveler at all. Perhaps a lot of you foreigner have been to more places in China than I have. So I'm planning to have a trip in China or euriope. I love Serbia and Russia. So Mostly I would travel to these two countries in the winter. Winter in Moscow, I just love it.\n\nEDIT6: An interesting fact. TOGOLAISE PEOPLE and other africans DO wear DOWN JACKETS and COATS !!! Unbelievable, right? They seem to have very little tolerance to cold(cool) weather. 24 degree and a little wind or rain means very cold to them.....Especially those motorbikers who have to drink fast in the wind.\n\nEDIT7: The major public transportation here in Togo and many other african countries is motorbike. Cheap motorbikes are their taxis. Most people take motorbike to move to another place. Thanks to chinese merchants who sell cheap Chinese motorbikes here. A lot of people could afford this cheap vehicles and make a living from it. Though I have to say the Chinese bikes have quite low qualities. Very polluting, very noisy, not very comfortable, high failure rate(which motivate the spare parts market).....\n\nEDIT8: An redditer pointed out my ignorance generalization and prejudice shown in my speech toward African people.

I also think it's ridiculous that so many Chinese people are getting all worked up over them... in my mind they don't care about the islands but rather just venting their anger towards Japan. I went to the protest to take pictures and observe.\n\nIt was a *really* racist protest. Chants of \"\"日本鬼子\"\"... lots of banners calling for Japan to be flattened, for China to go to war with Japan, another one that said \"\"Japanese People get the hell out of China.\"\" There were a few thousand people there, all decked out in Chinese flags and wearing red and stuff. In front of the embassy people were throwing rocks, eggs, and trash at the building.\n\nThere were *hundreds* of police and military there to keep the peace. They weren't interfering, just standing on the sidelines watching and keeping things in check. I was only there about 10 minutes before a cop grabbed me and interrogated me about if I was a reporter or what. I forgot to bring my passport or any sort of identification, and I told him so, but he didn't mind... I guess I'm lucky because they probably could have arrested me for not having my passport on me.\n\nThen the cop told me that I had to leave, \"\"for my safety\"\". I didn't want any trouble, so I left. He took me behind the police lines and I left through the back... while I was leaving (on a near-empty street), a group of protestors were walking towards me, eyeing me, and I heard them say something about \"\"外国人\"\". With all the anti-foreigner sentiment in the air, I thought it was a good idea to say \"\"中国加油!\"\" to them... they laughed, and I went on my merry way.\n\nA little bit scary but definitely one of the more interesting experiences I've had in China. I have a bunch of photos and videos, I'll get them uploaded soon and edit this post.\n\n**Edit**: First video is up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyH4RzrtT_w\n\n2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH_cP0xkjg4\n\n3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8BqzgvELaM\n\n4: http://youtu.be/-FGYAaKcaGo\n\n5: http://youtu.be/dDsWnblH46c\n\n6: This one shows people throwing stuff at the embassy building: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA29UPnuZ10&amp;feature=plcp\n\n**Edit 2:** Another thing I forgot to mention is that I believe the police may have been using cell-phone jamming technology. I know that they were having buses skip the stops nearby the embassy to control the amount of people coming it, it wouldn't surprise me if they were jamming phones to prevent people from organizing. After I was ejected by the cop, I tried calling some people but my phone kept telling me \"\"network busy\"\"... once I was a few hundred meters away it worked fine again.\n\n**Edit 3:** Photos of the protests in Suzhou, courtesy of Shindekudasai: http://imgur.com/a/wiReb\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,1347702741.0,,,True,t3_zx0g9,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/zx0g9/i_went_to_watch_the_protests_at_the_japanese/,\n\n1364757611.0,126,i.imgur.com,1bdf9a,\"New Mods, New /r/china\",loller,163,37,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1bdf9a/new_mods_new_rchina/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,us,False,t3_1bdf9a,http://i.imgur.com/Q6ZSoU2.jpg,moderator\n\n1356033570.0,123,i.imgur.com,156mhs,\"The World Divided into 5 Regions, Each with the Same Population as China (x-post from mapPorn)\",platypusmusic,138,15,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/156mhs/the_world_divided_into_5_regions_each_with_the/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_156mhs,http://i.imgur.com/Px19X.png,\n\n1368801493.0,123,i.imgur.com,1eipcy,\"I never knew this wider, even more impressive shot of Tank Man existed (photo by Stuart Franklin).\",relevantdetails,140,17,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1eipcy/i_never_knew_this_wider_even_more_impressive_shot/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,nl,False,t3_1eipcy,http://i.imgur.com/c5IhBwj.jpg,\n\n1354613404.0,122,self.China,149774,\"Any interest in an AMA with my granddad?

They're all great questions!\n\nI can take a bunch of questions here, ask him tomorrow, and then post his responses in a new thread.\n\nHere's some background about him:\n\nHe was born in 1928 in [叶县, 河南](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_County). He lived there through the 1942-1943 famine. When the Japanese came, he fled to the west.\n\nAfter the Japanese surrendered, he came back to 河南. He graduated from high school in [安阳](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang) in 1947. He was going to go to college, but the Communists surrounded 安阳 and he was unable to flee the city. After the Communists captured the city, he went to 开封 in 1948 to try and apply for college again. However, the Communists surrounded and then captured 开封. After this happened, he decided to join the Communist Party.\n\nAfter the civil war ended in 1949, he was sent to 长沙 to work for the government there. In 1952, he was appointed Vice-Mayor of the North District of 长沙. In 1958 he was appointed Mayor of the North District. This was when the [Great Chinese Famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine) was occurring.\n\nHe was purged and removed from this post in 1963 during the [Cultural Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_revolution). He was then put in charge of managing the [上山下乡运动](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement) for 长沙.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, he was assigned to manage the 长沙 Bus Company. He was forced into retirement/purged again in 1982 because the government wanted younger people to be in charge. He still received an official salary, but didn't have to come to work, so he ended up travelling a lot during this time. He officially retired in 1993.\n\nHere are some other anecdotes/stories he's told me about:\n\nDuring the 1942-43 famine, he was in middle school. He said in the morning all the students would go out and pick wild plants and bark so that the school cafeteria could make them soup for lunch. He would see dead people on the side of the road every day.\n\nHe said the early late 1930s and early 1940s Henan had the \"\"Four Big Disasters\"\" (四大灾害): 水, 旱, 蝗, 汤. 水 is the [1938 Yellow River Flood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Yellow_River_flood). 旱 and 蝗 references the famines of 1942-43 and 汤 references [汤恩伯](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Enbo) who was the commander of military forces in 河南. He said that the military didn't do anything to help out with the famine and as soon as the Japanese showed up, the Nationalist forces all ran away.\n\nAt the time, when a person died, the family didn't bury the deceased because it was too much work. What they did was to take bricks and build sort of a burial mound over them. 汤恩伯 wanted to build a military academy in 南阳. He said people would carry bricks from where he lived all the way to 南阳. Since everyone was so weak from the lack of food, there wasn't a lot of brick production, so they would steal the bricks from the burial mounds to take to build the military academy.\n\nHe puts a lot of blame of the [Great Leap Forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_leap_forward) on the Communist Party. When peasants were ordered to make steel and iron in their backyards, crop production dropped; however, the leaders still reported normal grain production to the state. The state would take their share of grain which left very little grain for the civilians because of the false reporting.\n\nIn the 1960s, China was very poor. He said everyone was given ration coupons. Every person received between 27-33 斤 of grain, 1/4斤 of oil, and 1/4 斤of meat per month. One 斤 is a little more than one pound. The yearly ration of cloth was 2.5尺. My grandmother worked at a market, and when fruits and vegetables started to spoil, they would have to cut off the spoiled parts and continue to sell the good parts. She would buy the spoiled parts of the food for a lot less than the unspoiled parts to take home to have more food.\n\nAdditionally, if you wanted to buy electronics, there would be coupons for them. When he was mayor, the entire office only had one telephone. He didn't buy a telephone himself until the 1980s when he was with the bus company. He said he was the first person at his work to buy a telephone. He said the ration coupons stopped sometime around 1990.\n\nHe has some resentment towards the Communist Party because of the Great Leap Forward and his purging during the Cultural Revolution.

People who are mentally unbalanced. And People with bizarre get rich quick schemes. So I want to know, who was the shadiest person you've met? I'll start:\n\nOne guy I knew came to China as a secret missionary years ago. I believe the idea was that he would proselytize while teaching English. But instead of him converting the Chinese it sort of went the other way. He became one of the most depraved people I've ever met. I've never know anyone to start more stories with, \"\"I woke up in a bathhouse.\"\" He used to go around saying that \"\"there is no reason to ever masturbate in China since you can always get someone to do it for you.\"\" He would come to a 100 minute class 15 minutes late, leave 20 minutes early and be either hung over or drinking during the class. He once through a toaster through a window when he thought a party was too boring. And after he left, when they cleaned out his apartment, they found dozens of pill bottles that didn't belong to him, and so much trash that it looked like a homeless person lived there.\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_15tir8,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/15tir8/whos_the_shadiest_person_youve_met_in_china/,\n\n1338861880.0,99,imgur.com,ulccw,My photos of HK's Tiananmen vigil last night,mod83,115,16,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/ulccw/my_photos_of_hks_tiananmen_vigil_last_night/,,,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,False,t3_ulccw,http://imgur.com/a/aMRL9,\n\n1372232819.0,99,scmp.com,1h3gq9,\"It's official, fellas!

He never gave me a price so I told him I would think about it.\n\nI tried to find other artists today but I couldn't. So I came back and expected them to price gouge the hell out of me.\n\nTo my surprise, he had already done it. I was certain nothing had been lost in translation in our previous conversation, yet here it was, completed, even though I could have never came back and found someone else. The artist wasn't there but his wife and child were, and as it turns out he wanted to give it to me for free. After much reluctance, I gave in and accepted without paying.\n\nThe wife asked me to sit down and stay for a while, so I obliged. We must have talked for about an hour, which is always great for me - it makes me use words I learned a few months ago but never use in daily conversation.\n\nLeaving, like every other Chinese family it seems, she gave me a bag of fruit for home.\n\nThe hospitality of the Chinese people is something I'll never forget. I love this country so much. I always hear foreigners bag on China, the same ones that never go outside their bubble and never bother to learn the language.\n\nI'm just so goddamned happy and thankful to be living here.\",,False,,t5_2qh2v,False,,,True,t3_14fwzo,http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/14fwzo/the_hospitality_of_the_chinese/,\n\n1348787976.0,81,shanghaiist.com,10l8vs,Chinese girls taking pics of themselves doing the splits becomes latest internet meme.
