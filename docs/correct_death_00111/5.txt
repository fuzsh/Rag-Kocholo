Lester B. Pearson

“I’ve had almost as many lives as a cat,” said Lester Bowles Pearson. He was a stretcher-bearer, a sausage-stuffer, and a sportsman. He studied history at Oxford, taught it at the University of Toronto, and made it as a rising diplomat. He was an architect of NATO and other international institutions, and became the best-known Canadian of the post-war era. As foreign minister, he won a Nobel Peace Prize for “saving the world” during the Suez Crisis. As opposition leader, he rebuilt the Liberal Party and returned it to power. And as Canada’s fourteenth Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson amassed an impressive list of accomplishments, including the introduction of universal health care, student loans, the Canada Pension Plan, the development of bilingual civil service and a new Canadian flag.
