        "text": "April 4, 2017 Ottawa, Ontario Parks Canada Agency\n\nToday, the Honourable Andrew Leslie, Member of Parliament for Orleans on behalf of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada, Catherine McKenna, recognized the importance of the creation of Canada’s national flag and the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, as events of national significance, and also recognized Lester Bowles Pearson as a person of national historic significance.\n\nThe Government of Canada is committed to connecting Canadians to the significant events that contributed to our country’s rich and varied history. Canada’s 14th Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson, had a profound impact on the nation as both a diplomat and a politician. He laid the groundwork for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and championed the new and current Canadian flag.\n\nIn 1949, Canada took its place on the world stage, when as Foreign Minister, Pearson helped negotiate the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, which created the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. During the election campaign of 1963, Pearson campaigned on a promise to create a new national flag for Canada within two years if elected. He kept that promise, and adopted in 1965, the national flag of Canada that has become a universally recognized emblem that truly represents our country.\n\nCanada’s national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation area enable Canadians to experience their rich history and heritage in a special way and play a big part in the celebration of Canada’s 150th anniversary of Confederation. As part of the centennial of national historic sites, Parks Canada invites Canadians to be inspired and captivated by the stories of the people and events that shaped the Canada of today."
