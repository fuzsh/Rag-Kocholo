        "text": "This project is intended to provide a permanent base building/life safety generator that will provide the backup power for all base building/life safety operations for the foreseeable future. The proposed permanent generator would renew a significantly aging asset as the current base building generators are nearly 50 years old and well past their expected service life. Additionally, this project is looking to add its own fuel distribution system to supply only the base building/life safety generator. This will be achieved by disconnecting from the existing 10,000L fuel bunker and removal of the existing day tank. A new pad mounted external fuel tank with spill containment devices will be added exterior to the building.\n\nA feasibility study was done to determine the optimal size, location and system architecture of the new base building/life safety generator and power distribution system. The recommended option of a 1.0MW exterior pad mounted and weathertight enclosed unit with external pad mounted fuel storage was selected. This will allow the removal of the existing base building/life safety generator from the generator room permitting additional space for new distribution equipment to be installed in a code compliant manner."
