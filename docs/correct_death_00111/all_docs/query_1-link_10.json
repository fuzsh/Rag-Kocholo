        "text": "Lester Bowles Pearson was born on April 23, 1897, in Newtonbrooke, Ontario (now part of Toronto). He lived in several towns in Ontario as he was growing up, and he attended the University of Toronto for college.\n\nDuring World War I (1914–18) Pearson left college to serve in the military. Afterwards he returned to the university and finished his degree. He later attended the University of Oxford. He then taught history at the University of Toronto from 1924 to 1928. He joined the Canadian foreign service in 1928 and spent most of the rest of his career working with the governments of foreign countries.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1941 Pearson worked in Great Britain. He then moved to the United States. He worked at the Canadian embassy there and served as the Canadian ambassador to the United States in 1945–46. In 1948 he entered politics in Canada. He was elected to the House of Commons for the Liberal Party. He also represented Canada at the United Nations from 1948 to 1956. For part of that time, in 1952–53, he was president of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nDuring his time at the United Nations he helped settle the end of the Korean War. In 1956–57 he also helped solve a crisis when several countries fought for control over the Suez Canal in the Middle East. For his efforts, Pearson was awarded the Nobel prize for peace in 1957.\n\nAt home, Pearson became the leader of the Liberal Party in 1958. At the time another party—the Progressive Conservative Party—was in power. But Pearson was still a member of the House of Commons. As such he worked to increase cooperation between Canada and the United States. In 1963 the Liberals won the national elections and became the party in power. Pearson then became the prime minister. Under Pearson, Canada adopted its first distinctive national flag and its official national anthem. The government also introduced programs to address social issues. These included plans to provide health care to more people, to provide money for people to attend college, and to help people financially after they retire."
