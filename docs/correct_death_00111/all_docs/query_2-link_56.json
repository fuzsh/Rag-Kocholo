He was the 14th Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968.\n\nBorn in 1897 in Newtonbrook, Toronto, Ontario\n\nResided in Kleinburg, Ontario\n\nDied in 1972 in Ottawa, Ontario\n\nBorn in Toronto of Irish stock on both sides of his family, Lester B. Pearson received a balanced education in politics, learning the conservative position from his father, a Methodist minister, and the liberal from his mother.\n\nLester Pearson’s family roots in Kleinburg date back to 1894 when Lester’s father, a Methodist minister, moved his family to Kleinburg to preach at the local Methodist church. During their time in Kleinburg, the family lived at the Old Parsonage House on Lester B.

In 1923 he received a B.A. degree with Second-Class honours in modern history at St John’s College at the University of Oxford, and the M.A. in 1925. In 1928 Pearson left academic life to accept a position as the first secretary in the Canadian Department of External Affairs. He moved forward rapidly.\n\nIn 1945, he was named Canadian ambassador to the United States and attended the founding conference of the United Nations at San Francisco.\n\nIn 1958 Pearson was elected leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nAs Prime Minister Pearson brought in many of Canada’s major updated social programs, including\n\nuniversal health care\n\nthe Canada Pension Plan,\n\nCanada Student Loans,\n\nInstituted a new national flag, the Maple Leaf flag\n\nthe 40-hour work week,\n\ntwo weeks vacation time,\n\na new minimum wage."
