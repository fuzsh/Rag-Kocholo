If you have any questions or need further assistance please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nSign-Up for Parent Portal AccountHelpful Hints\n\nSchool Messenger AccountHelpful Hints\n\nRegister for School Cash On-Line Account\n\nUpdate Your Child’s Health Forms\n\nFill Out School Forms on Parent PortalHelpful Hints\n\nUpdate Your Contact Information on Parent Portal Helpful Hints\n\nWe look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday, September 3.\n\nWe’d like to inform you that we’ve identified and resolved an issue that affected high school grades.\n\nFor some schools, student grade information sent during the recent high school data transmission was not updated on students’ college applications, even though we received it through the SSLOAD process. As a result, some applicants’ final marks and graduation data weren’t transmitted to the colleges.\n\nWe’re currently working to reload the affected files and verify that applicant grades are updated in their applications. The colleges have also been informed of the issue and will receive any grade data that wasn’t initially loaded over the next few days. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this delay.\n\nApplicants can view high school grades within their college applications and we encourage them to check to ensure their grades are accurate. If you receive any additional reports from applicants about missing grades or if you have questions, please contact us at service@ocas.ca.\n\nMidterm report cards will be available on the Parent Portal today at 5:00pm.\n\nThis provides an opportunity for meaningful conversations with your child about their academic achievements and areas for growth.\n\nIf you do not have access to the Parent Portal, please register using this link.\n\nNeed some help with setting up Parent Portal or locating your child's Progress Report?
