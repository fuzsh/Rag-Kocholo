        "text": "Pierre Elliot Trudeau was the fifteenth prime minister of Canada. He had many accomplishments that benefited all of Canada which include the official language act of Canada where he made French and English the official languages, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, and the liberalization of laws on abortion, homosexuality and the legalization of lotteries. These are only a few of the many accomplishments that Pierre Trudeau achieved for Canada while his position in Parliament that was important.\n\nVery few Canadians have made the same impacts on Canadian quality of life as Pierre Trudeau did as his time as a politician. During his time as a prime minister, he brought forth many changes that greatly improved the quality of all Canadians living in the country. He made the diverse population of Canada feel safe and included. Pierre trudeau has caused a significant increase on Canadians’ quality of life by helping introduce legislation such as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Official Languages act which made Canadians feel safe, protected and included. Although this influential Canadian has caused many and important positive impacts on the lives of Canadians, Pierre Trudeau has also brought forth negative, but temporary\n\nIn todays world Canadians help each other fund money to help those in need; Canadians help so much that most medical services are funded public sources. Many of us would not even bother to help those in need, but Lester B. Pearson changed that part of us. He made health care such a big issue that it can not hide anywhere in this world. Lester B. Pearson, the man that gave Canada Universal Medicare also created the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.\n\n“The choice, however, is as clear now for nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction. ” 1 and Lester B. Pearson was definitely a man of peace. To those who don’t know who Lester B. Pearson is, he’s the fourteenth Prime Minister of Canada, that served from April 22. 1963 - April 20. 1968 2. During his time as Prime Minister, he’s accomplished many things, and that’s why I believe that Lester B. Pearson is the greatest Canadian.\n\nPierre Trudeau is one of Canada’s most renowned Prime Ministers. He was in office April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and later on March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984,.¹ An event that Pierre Trudeau is well known for is the enactment of the War Measures Act during the October Crisis. This decision to invoke the War Measures Act during the October Crisis has led to a great deal of controversy on whether the act was justified. The October Crisis was a series of events in October 1970, these events began with the kidnappings of James Cross and later Pierre Laporte by the group known as the FLQ (Front de libération du Québec) the group’s main goals were to create an independent Quebec.2 The group resorted to terrorist acts in order to achieve those goals, this later led to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoking the War Measures Act. The War Measures Act was a federal statute adopted by parliament during WWI and has been used 3 times; during WWI, WWII and during the October Crisis. The act gives major power to the Canadian government to uphold security during times of great distress.3 Pierre Trudeau was justified in enacting the War Measures Act during the October Crisis. One reason that Pierre Trudeau was justified in invoking the War Measures Act is that the FLQ was essentially a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths and injuries of countless people. Since the group was formed in the early 1960’s, the terrorist group’s acts had only worsened from mailbox bombings to\n\nPierre Trudeau was the 15th prime minister of Canada. During his time as prime minister he changed a lot of Canadians lives for the better. He also, made history that will never be forgotten by past, present and future Canadians. Pierre Trudeau kept Canada united, avoiding Quebec to separate from Canada. Trudeau passed many the “Official Language Act” in 1969 making English and French Canada’s official languages. This act made government workers to offer services in both English and French. Trudeau passed many bills and acts, which adequately helped Canada to develop more as a nation. He abolished the death penalty in 1976 which didn’t make people die for the crimes they did or did not commit. He strengthened gun control laws so deaths by gun\n\nJohn Diefenbaker was the last “old Tory” to be the Prime Minister of Canada. He was a member of the Conservative Party with deep values as well as being a British loyalist who supported the Queen. Diefenbaker was also a man that was well known for not supporting anything he thought was anti- British. This sentiment was most evident when Diefenbaker criticized the Liberal’s refusal to support Britain in the Suez Canal crisis and sided with the Americans. This loyalty the Diefenbaker had to the British Commonwealth would not serve him well as Prime Minister of Canada. In 1958, Diefenbaker would win the largest majority government in Canadian history upsetting the new leader of the Liberal Party, Lester B. Pearson, who had taken over for St.\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was arguably one of the most vivacious and charismatic Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. He wore capes, dated celebrities and always wore a red rose boutonniere. He looked like a superhero, and often acted like one too. Some of the landmark occurrences in Canadian history all happened during the Trudeau era, such as patriating the constitution, creating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the 1980 Quebec Referendum. However, it is Trudeau’s 1969 “white paper” and the Calder legal challenge which many consider to be one of his most influential contributions to Canadian history.\n\nJohn George Diefenbaker and Lester Bowles Pearson both acted as Prime Minister of Canada during the Cold War. The two were from different Canadian political parties that accorded to their beliefs and principles, Diefenbaker being a Progressive Conservative party member and Pearson a Liberal. Diefenbaker was leaning left as a Conservative, similarly to Eisenhower, who was presiding at the time, and thus shared a fair relationship with him, though the same could not be said for the US in general; Pearson’s administration presided also along a Democratic administration in the US, though they clashed often due to the American actions in the Vietnam War. Diefenbaker was elected to office as his party held the greatest proportion in the Parliament, however, he won only with a minority. During his administration, Diefenbaker implemented policies that were considered liberal, most of which he was able to pass, in contrast to Pearson, who only succeeded in passing near half of his due to the majority he lacked most times in the House of Commons. Both Diefenbaker and Pearson had political experience before they became PMs, they also share a similarity in that they attempted to solidify Canada as a nation and to remove the hyphenation in Canadian citizenship; both achieving success in varying extents. However, Diefenbaker shared differing views on Canadian dependence and\n\nTommy Douglas was the first person to ever lead a social-democratic government in Canada. It was because of his views that his political opponents often criticized him. They labelled him as a “red” and a “communist” at times, because he believed in socialism and that everyone deserved free healthcare, even the one’s who were poor and and in a bad situation. His impact on Canadians was a great one. Especially the ones were suffering from the economic depression that had it’s grip on Saskatchewan. Tommy Douglas worked to create a better society in Saskatchewan and Canada, he wanted to alleviate the suffering. He is known for how he drastically increased welfare benefits. By providing electricity to the farmers in the rural areas, he helped the poor farmers. By establishing a universal healthcare system, he helped the ones who were suffering from disease or sickness but couldn’t pay for help. By introducing the first ever auto insurance in Canada, he made accidents less tragic. He was a hero the citizens.\n\nMary Rose McGeady once said, “There is no greater joy nor greater reward than to make a fundamental difference in someone 's life.” Canadian history has had several pioneers that set a precedent within the Social Welfare system in tremendous ways. Simply by having the want to make a difference in the lives of others, and the courage to take action. Within this essay you will read about 2 Canadian pioneers.
