        "text": "Project description\n\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC), in collaboration with Global Affairs Canada, is restoring and modernizing the Lester B. Pearson Building (LBPB).\n\nThe project is divided into 4 phases:\n\nPhase 1: The refit of Tower D\n\nConstruction was completed in summer 2021\n\nPhase 2: The refit of Tower B\n\nConstruction is expected to be completed in 2024\n\nPhase 3: The refit of Tower C\n\nPlanning and design is expected in 2023\n\nConstruction is expected to be completed in 2027\n\nPhase 4: The refit of Tower A\n\nPSPC is evaluating new dates for the construction of Tower A\n\nWith a focus on employee wellness, universal accessibility and environmental sustainability, we will implement a complete building retrofit. This includes updating various parts of the building such as:\n\nplumbing\n\nheating\n\nventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)\n\nelevators\n\nelectrical and security systems\n\nAs we move forward with the design and rehabilitation of the building, we will preserve its historical significance and character and also introduce sustainable and energy efficient features.\n\nThe project will create a modern workplace that follows GCworkplace standards and meets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) gold certification.\n\nThe workspaces will be fully accessible by providing solutions such as:\n\naccessible and gender-neutral universal washrooms\n\nmodernized elevators with touchless operation features, as well as visual and auditory indicators\n\nelectric height-adjustable work surfaces and ergonomic furniture\n\npower actuated doors and tactile signage for people with visual and physical disabilities\n\nmodern fire alarm system with strobe lights\n\nselection of healthy building materials and finishes with low volatile organic compounds\n\nfully accessible counters in kitchenettes and washrooms\n\nworkstations that accommodate mobility devices and service animals\n\nExterior work\n\nSome of the exterior work includes:\n\nlandscaping to the grounds, courtyards and roof terraces\n\nbuilding exterior upgrades and window replacement, contributing to an 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (compared to 2005)\n\nsustainable features including extensive vegetated roofs and solar panels (photovoltaic) for on site power generation\n\nexterior building illumination to comply with the National Capital Commission Capital Illumination Plan, created to enhance the Capital’s nighttime beauty, enrich the resident and visitor experience, as well as promote environmentally responsible lighting practices\n\nInterior work\n\nSome of the interior work includes:\n\na modern workplace focusing on occupant wellness and accessibility\n\nan upgrade to the information technology\n\na state-of-the-art bike parking facility, equipped with showers and lockers for active transportation and users\n\nlight-emitting diode lighting throughout the building to reduce energy consumption\n\nOngoing concurrent projects\n\nThe following projects are being done at the same time as the major rehabilitation project. This gives us the opportunity to improve the building performance and the department’s operations.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada Mail Distribution Centre relocation project\n\nThis project will provide an offsite facility for the Global Logistics Management division. It will allow the division to safely store, transport, and handle assets in support of mission programs abroad. The offsite facility will free up office space in the building. The project is scheduled to be completed by 2024.\n\nLester B. Pearson Building generator replacement projects\n\n2 generator replacement projects are currently underway at 125 Sussex Drive. These projects aim to replace the existing Global Affairs/Tenant Generator and Life Safety Generator, ensuring the building maintains reliable backup power in alignment with ongoing modernization efforts. Both projects are scheduled for completion by 2027.\n\nBenefits to Canadians\n\nThis rehabilitation will provide significant benefits to the local and national economies through contract opportunities in the construction industry and related sectors, such as construction materials, manufacturing and professional services.\n\nProject background\n\nThe building is the flagship headquarter of Global Affairs Canada and is home to approximately 3,300 employees.\n\nCompleted in 1973, the building has not undergone any major building rehabilitation since its construction more than 50 years ago.\n\nCompleted projects\n\nThe garage project, completed in April 2021, included:\n\nstructural upgrades\n\nwaterproofing floor toppings\n\nmechanical and electrical upgrades\n\nfire protection upgrades\n\ntraffic control devices\n\nA security upgrade project, completed in spring 2021, has improved security for occupants and operations through:\n\na new security fence around the site perimeter\n\nscreening areas at the building entrances\n\nenhanced security zoning within the building\n\nHistory of the building\n\nConstruction began in May 1970 and took nearly 3 years to complete. The construction of the building was part of an intensive period of urban planning, which accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s, and continued into the 1970s.The building was named after the 14th Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nThe building was completed in 1973 to the designs of Webb Zerafa Menkes (now WZMH), the same firm also responsible for designing such iconic buildings as the CN Tower, in Toronto.\n\nIn 2012, it was designated as a federal heritage building. Federal government buildings, such as departmental headquarters, often employ robust materials that gain value as they age. They are eventually evaluated by agents of the Federal Heritage Building Review Office to determine if there is sufficient heritage value to warrant formal recognition. Where there is such value, designations such as classified or recognized, depending on the score obtained. The LBPB is a classified federal heritage building, the highest Federal Heritage Building Review Office designation. With this designation comes a certain measure of protection via additional intervention oversight and advice."
