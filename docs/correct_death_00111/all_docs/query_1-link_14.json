        "text": "LESTER B. PEARSON, former Prime Minister of Canada, will be remembered as one of the 20th century's most untiring and effective workers in the cause of world peace. For four decades, as diplomat, statesman, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, he gave unstintingly of himself in the service of Canada and the world community. The record of his accomplishments as an outstanding postwar leader has few equals.\n\nCanada has lost a great leader. We in the United States have lost a firm friend. The world has lost a great statesman and a wise counselor. His life illustrates in a profound way how much one man, by virtue of hard work, high principle, and a sympathetic understanding of his fellow man, can accomplish in the cause of peace and freedom.\n\nAs one who has had the privilege of knowing Lester Pearson for two decades, and who has counted him a friend, I shall miss him greatly."
