        "text": "This project is intended to provide a permanent tenant generator that will provide the backup power for all tenant operations for the foreseeable future. With the implementation of the Lester B. Pearson Rehabilitation project underway, they are a number of newly renovated client spaces looking to add to the existing tenant generator distribution system. The proposed permanent generator would provide extra capacity as well as flexibility, when accommodating back up power connections for other projects, as the existing back up power distribution system does not appear to be easily shut down in order to allow new connections. Additionally, this project is looking to add its own fuel distribution system to supply only the tenant owned generator. This will achieved by disconnecting from the existing 10,000L fuel bunker and removal of the existing day tank. A new pad mounted external fuel tank with spill containment devices will be added exterior to the building. The existing 10,000L fuel bunker will carry on supplying the base building/life safety generators until their replacement is complete.\n\nA feasibility study was done to determine the optimal size, location and system architecture of the new tenant generator and power distribution system. The recommended option of a 2.5MW exterior pad mounted and weathertight enclosed unit with external pad mounted fuel storage was selected. This will allow the removal of the existing tenant generator from the generator room permitting additional space for new distribution equipment to be installed in a code compliant manner."
