        "text": "(1897–1972). Statesman, Liberal party leader, and winner of the Nobel peace prize, Lester B. Pearson was prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968. He brought to the office many years of experience in international diplomacy.\n\nLester Bowles Pearson was born in Toronto, Ont., on April 23, 1897. His father and grandfather were Methodist ministers. In World War I he served in the medical corps and then in the Royal Flying Corps. After being injured in an airplane crash, he returned to school at the University of Toronto and then went to Oxford University in England. He taught history at the University of Toronto from 1924 to 1928.\n\nPearson entered government service in 1928 as a first secretary in the newly formed Department of External Affairs. The ambassador to the United States in 1945–46, he became secretary of state for external affairs (1948–57) in Prime Minister Louis Saint Laurent’s Liberal administration.\n\nPearson was responsible for persuading the leading powers to agree to the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states in 1947. He was one of the architects of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In addition, Pearson was chairman of the NATO Council (1951–52) at the time of the Korean War and sat on the three-man United Nations (UN) committee that negotiated the Korean cease-fire. In 1952–53 Pearson was president of the UN General Assembly. He was awarded the 1957 Nobel peace prize, chiefly for his work in creating the UN Emergency Force, which helped settle the Suez Canal crisis of 1956.\n\nWhen the Progressive Conservative party under John Diefenbaker defeated the Liberals in 1957, Pearson was out of public office for the first time in nearly 30 years. In 1958 he replaced Saint Laurent as head of the Liberal party and leader of the opposition in the House of Commons. He advocated close cooperation between Canada and the United States."
