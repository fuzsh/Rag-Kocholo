He was named after his maternal grandparents, Jane Lester and Thomas Bowles. His roots were largely Irish and Methodist, the only exception being his paternal grandmother who came from New England Quaker stock. Both his father and paternal grandfather were Methodist ministers, as were three of his mother's first cousins.\n\nHe was an excellent student with a love of athletics and sports that he would maintain throughout his life. He attended Victoria College, where his mother's cousin Rev. RP Bowles served as Chancellor.\n\nWhile at university during the First World War, Lester enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps and served overseas until an unfortunate accident with a bus during a London blackout ended his military career. One enduring consequence of his military experience was the nickname \"Mike\", which he retained for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter the war, he completed his BA and briefly tried his hand in business before settling in teaching history at University of Toronto. This was where he met his future wife, who was in one of his classes. He married Maryon Moody on August 22 1925 in Winnipeg, Manitoba in a double wedding ceremony that included Maryon's sister Grace and her groom.\n\nBy the time that the 1931 census was held, Lester (age 34) was working as a civl servant in Ottawa in the external affairs secretariat. He was the married head of household at 25 20 Russell, St. George Ward, Canada, Ontario, Canada.[1]\n\nHe worked his way up the ranks at External Affairs and became a Canadian diplomat, serving as Ambassador to the U.S. during the war. After the war he left the civil service to serve as Prime Minister King's Secretary of State for External Affairs. in 1952 he was elected president of the United Nations General Assembly; in Dec 1957 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, for helping to end the Suez crisis of 1956, by establishing the first United Nations peacekeeping mission.\n\nOn 22 April 1963 he became Prime Minister of Canada and was Prime Minister during Canada's centennial year, 1967. His government was responsible for the introduction of the Maple Leaf flag, the Canada Pension Plan and universal health care, among other accomplishments. He served until 20 April 1968, when he was succeeded by Pierre Elliott Trudeau.\n\nLester Pearson died on 27 December 1972 at Ottawa.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1931 Census: \"1931 Census of Canada\"\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada; Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Seventh Census of Canada, 1931; Folder Number: T-27285; Census Place: Ottawa (City of), Ontario, Canada; Page Number: 3\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 62640 #1733639 (accessed 28 November 2023)\n\nLester Pearson (34), married, Civil Servant, head of household at 25 20 Russell, St. George Ward, Canada, Ontario, Canada.
