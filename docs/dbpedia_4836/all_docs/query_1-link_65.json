        "text": "The purpose of this research is to identify and map the foaling locations for Kentucky-born Kentucky Derby winners, determine which birth sites have retained their horse farm functions, and explore the human and equine stories that shaped the landscapes and contributed to the cultural history of the Kentucky Derby. I investigate how a detailed geography of Kentucky Derby winners could impact Thoroughbred farms and tourism in Kentucky. The results of this research does, in some cases, challenge aspects of accepted Kentucky Derby history. The passage of time, errors in previously published accounts, and the vagaries of consistent equine record-keeping, makes this topic ripe for critical evaluation. The horses and the people around them—their “connections”— have compelling stories to be told. Although much has been written about the Kentucky Derby from a historical perspective, very little scholarly research has been done through a geographic lens. It is hoped that this research will draw attention to this rich area of spatial inquiry and contribute to a better understanding of the Kentucky Derby as a cultural institution."
