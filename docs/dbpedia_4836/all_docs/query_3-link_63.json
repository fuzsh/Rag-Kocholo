        "text": "The Kentucky Derby is set to be run on Saturday for the 150th time in its history. And per usual, the 2024 \"Run for the Roses\" will kickstart the quest for one of the most elusive titles in all of sports.\n\nThat would be horse racing's Triple Crown.\n\nTo date, there have only been 13 winners of the Triple Crown. Only two horses — American Pharoah and Justify — have accomplished the feat since 1979 and only one jockey, Eddie Arcaro, has won the Triple Crown twice.\n\nMORE: Full results, finish order from 2024 Kentucky Derby\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is the first leg of the three-race series and is the intermediate race of the event at 1 1/4 miles. It has been run since 1875 and is the youngest of the three Triple Crown races despite being known as the most prestigious.\n\nThe Derby is followed by the 1 3/16-mile Preakness Stakes and the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. There is a two-week gap between the Derby and the Preakness while the Belmont occurs three weeks after the Preakness is run.\n\nAs important as the latter two races are, neither can quite compare to the pomp and circumstance of the Kentucky Derby. The race at Churchill Downs provides its winner with a great deal of hope, as it guarantees the winner a chance to win the Triple Crown by being the first to be run.\n\nSo which horses have won the Kentucky Derby and had a chance to complete the Triple Crown? And which ones have actually achieved that feat? Here's what to know about the history of winners on horse racing's grandest stages.\n\nMORE: How much prize money will Kentucky Derby winner receive?\n\nKentucky Derby winners list\n\nThere have been 149 official winners in the history of the Kentucky Derby. Below is a list of all the winning horses and their finishing times.\n\nYear Horse Time to finish 1875 Aristides 2:37.75 1876 Vagrant 2:38.25 1877 Baden-Baden 2:38 1878 Day Star 2:37.25 1879 Lord Murphy 2:37 1880 Fonso 2:37.50 1881 Hindoo 2:40 1882 Apollo 2:40.25 1883 Leonatus 2:43 1884 Buchanan 2:40.25 1885 Joe Cotton 2:37.25 1886 Ben Ali 2:36.25 1887 Montrose 2:39.25 1888 Macbeth II 2:38.25 1889 Spokane 2:34.50 1890 Riley 2:45 1891 Kingman 2:52.25 1892 Azra 2:41.50 1893 Lookout 2:39.25 1894 Chant 2:41 1895 Halma 2:37.50 1896 Ben Brush 2:07.75 1897 Typhoon II 2:12.50 1898 Plaudit 2:09 1899 Manuel, F.
