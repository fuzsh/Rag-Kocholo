        "text": "The Kentucky Derby is the biggest spectacle in horse racing and has been for quite some time.\n\n\"The Run for the Roses\" has existed for 150 years, and incredibly, it has always been contested in the same place.\n\nChurchill Downs racetrack hosted the first Kentucky Derby in 1875. It will host this year's version of the race, as well, and shows no signs of ever relinquishing its title as the derby's home.\n\nHere's what to know about Churchill Downs, including its location, history, and the horses that have earned Kentucky Derby wins at the historic landmark.\n\nMORE: Who will win the Kentucky Derby in 2024?\n\nWhere is the Kentucky Derby held?\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs, a horse racing track located in Louisville, Ky. The track first opened in 1875 and has hosted the Kentucky Derby since its creation.\n\nChurchill Downs history\n\nChurchill Downs was the brainchild of Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. — grandson of the famed explorer William Clark — after his father-in-law Richard Ten Broeck, a horse breeder and trainer, introduced him to horse racing.\n\nClark Jr. saw the Epsom Derby in England and desired to create something similar in the United States. Using 80 acres of land leased to him by his uncles, John and Henry Churchill, Clark created the track and established the Louisville Jockey Club and Driving Park Association, of which he was president. He then went on to hold races at the track.\n\nClark eventually sold the track in 1894 to a group headed by William E. Applegate. That group further established traditions at Churchill Downs, crafting the famous grandstand and shortening the derby's length to 1 1/4 miles. They also began adorning a rose garland on the Kentucky Derby winner, which earned the race its nickname \"The Run for the Roses.\"\n\nFrom there, the Kentucky Derby grew into one of the biggest spectacles in horse racing, with Churchill Downs serving as its lifelong home and one of the most recognizable venues in the sport. It was officially designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\nIYER: Fast facts to know before you pick a Kentucky Derby winner in 2024\n\nWhen was the first Kentucky Derby held?\n\nThe first Kentucky Derby was held in 1875, the same year Churchill Downs was founded. It took place on May 17 as part of a 15-horse field.\n\nAristides — ridden by Oliver Lewis and trained by Ansel Williamson — won the 1 1/2-mile race with a time of 2:37.75. The winning team took home a prize of $2,850.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby's length was adjusted to 1 1/4 miles in 1896. That iteration of the race was won by Ben Brush, who was ridden by Willie Simms and trained by Hardy Campbell.\n\nThe winning team of that eight-horse race received $4,850.\n\nKentucky Derby winners by year\n\nThe Kentucky Derby will be run for the 150th time in 2024. Here's a look at the race's previous 149 winners."
