        "text": "Daniel Mauck Galbreath had a reputation as a conservative real estate developer. But even his cautious stewardship could not save his business or the family fortune.\n\nAs head of the eighth-largest real estate development company in the country, he guides a family-run business that has erected skyscrapers for Borden Inc., the Mobil Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company. And Forbes magazine put his wealth at about $340 million only a year ago.\n\nBut nearly empty office buildings, meager rents and $800 million in debts, much of which he cannot repay, have virtually wiped out his fortune. Not Like Most Developers\n\nThe Galbreath family, unlike most real estate developers in the 1980's, rarely constructed a building without first signing up a significant number of tenants. They would painstakingly line up a major corporation as an anchor tenant before breaking ground, take a fee for putting the project together and reduce their long-term risk by taking limited owership stakes in the buildings.\n\nBut the swift and severe drop in market values for commercial office buildings and the denial of bank credit to developers have doomed several Galbreath projects and taken nearly all of the family's wealth with them. Monument Tower, in Indianapolis, for example, was started in 1987 with a $181 million loan, but today the 48-story building, the tallest in the state, is valued at only about 60 percent of the original loan. With more than half of the space unleased and the loan in default, Citicorp the principal lender, is on the verge of seizing the property.\n\nBecause Mr. Galbreath personally guaranteed some of the loans, he is struggling to avoid bankruptcy for himself as well as his company, the Galbreath Company of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
