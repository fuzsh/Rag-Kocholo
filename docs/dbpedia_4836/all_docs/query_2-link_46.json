        "text": "At the Derby, this bay stallion took the lead. Then, at the halfway pole, Lexex took the lead. As the horses went into the turn, Hindoo regained the lead, and when he entered the stretch he was in command and won by four lengths going away.\n\nHindoo was never out of the money winning thirty times, placing second three times, and showing third twice. As a three-year-old, he won the 1881 Kentucky Derby in a season where he recorded eighteen straight wins over the course of a few months-nineteen if a dead-heat run-off on the same day counts. Over the course of his racing career, he won $71,875, making him America’s leading money earner. He was one of the first handful of horses inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nAll horses had a good start, with the bay stallion, Ben Ali, staying bunched in the pack for most of the race. Entering the home stretch, he was second behind Free Knight with Blue Wing third. The trio battled it out, with Ben Ali and Blue Wing continuing to duel at the furlong pole. At that point, Blue Wing swerved to the outside, allowing jockey Paul Duffy to ride Ben Ali to victory on the rail, taking the race by half of a length. The race was called by the New York Times, “the grandest Derby ever run”.\n\nThis Derby race led to a boycott because the wagering rights changed under new ownership, thus there were no bookmakers at the race. Ben Ali’s owner was not able to place a bet on his horse and was treated poorly by the new owner. The treatment of the horse owners caused a nationwide boycott of the Kentucky Derby, nearly causing Churchill Downs to close.\n\nThe chestnut thoroughbred stallion is the only horse foaled and trained in Montana (territory at that time). Montana was admitted to the Union that same year.\n\nSpokane got on the rail and closed in the stretch to the cheers of the crowd to win by a nose in the final strides. In a time before photo finish, it was left to the judges who awarded the win to Spokane after deliberation.\n\nAfter spending a few years as a stud, in 1898, he was sold at auction for the low price of $170.\n\nThe later years of Spokane’s life are unknown. Some records indicate he returned to Montana at age six, some that he was fatally stabbed by a pitchfork, or died in a railway accident, or died peacefully at age 30 in Montana.\n\nThe bay stallion, best known for running the first race at its current, shorter length and also the first in which a blanket of red roses were draped over the shoulders of the winner.\n\nHaving never run farther than seven furlongs in his career, he stumbled badly coming away from the barrier, nearly unseating his jockey. By the time they recovered, the race seemed over for Ben Brush, but he made a tremendous move on the backstretch, caught First Mate on the turn for home, and battled fiercely with Ben Elder down the stretch before winning by a nose. The correspondent for the “Spirit of the Times” wrote, “Simms made one last and desperate rally with Ben Brush, displaying as vigorous a piece of riding as was ever seen, and gradually but surely gaining on the other Ben, he finally beat him out by a nose in a terrific and hair-raising finish, which elicited a wild and spontaneous shout from the grandstand.”\n\nHe died at the age of 25.\n\nThe chestnut stallion’s entry in the Kentucky Derby remained uncertain until just 45 minutes before the race, when the owner sought out jockey Hal Booker and told him to get ready to ride.\n\nThe 1903 Kentucky Derby was the first to be started with a web barrier. Consisting of a wide tape strung between two iron arms, the barrier was set up so that it would snap up and forward out of the horses’ way when the starter pressed a button. The web barrier would be used until 1930, when the mechanical starting gate was introduced at Churchill Downs.\n\nJudge Himes was described in post-Kentucky Derby coverage as being of “great size” and “splendid conformation”; however, later coverage described him as “homely.” He was a difficult horse to ride, possibly because of persistent heel soreness, and was known as “the old rogue” around the stable. He particularly favored heavy going. He was injured in December of his 5-year-old season and never regained his earlier form.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for his often temperamental and difficult personality, which led to him being gelded at the end of 1910.\n\nWilliam Gerst (his owner) remarked on Donau’s qualities and personality, “[he] has the speed of a sprinter, the courage of a bulldog, and the gameness of a fighting cock.” Fred Herbert, Donau’s jockey in the Derby, said of the often-temperamental horse, “he likes to be in company and don’t fret a bit when he comes on the track with another horse, while just alone he is a bit nervous.“\n\nHe was being retrained as a steeplechaser when he died at the age of six during an epidemic that killed three and sickened 18 other horses at the Nashville farm.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for his win standing as the biggest longshot victory in the history of the Kentucky Derby-going off at 91–1.\n\nBecause of the overcrowding at the 1913 Kentucky Derby, there were not enough stables, so Donerail was housed at Douglass Park, about three miles away from Churchill Downs, and would have to walk that distance before the start.\n\nIt is not known when Donerail died, and much of what became of him after his racing career ended remains a mystery; however, he was retired in 1917 and briefly used as breeding stallion in Lexington, where he commanded a stud fee of $50. In December 1917, Hayes donated Donerail to the Remount Service for use as a sire of cavalry horses.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby by eight lengths in a time of 2:03 2/5, setting a time record that would not be broken for 16 years and a margin record that has been tied but never broken.\n\nThree weeks after the Derby, Old Rosebud sustained a bowed tendon during the May 1914 running of the Withers Stakes at Belmont Park. The race was run clockwise around the track instead of the more customary, in the U.S., counter-clockwise direction. Running the wrong way confused Old Rosebud, who did not change leads coming into the stretch. He was taken out of competition for two seasons as a result of the injury.\n\nOld Rosebud was plagued by ailments throughout his life, culminating in a fatal injury at a claiming race when he was 11 years old and had to be euthanized.\n\nThe black stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe 1916 Kentucky Derby was run on a clear day with a field of 9 horses. George Smith was the clear contender of the race from the start. The only competition for the win came from Star Hawk, who lost the race by a neck after a rally in the home stretch.\n\nGeorge Smith was retired from racing at age five and stood at stud. In 1926, George Smith was donated to the Breeding Bureau of The Jockey Club. By the following year, George Smith was in the possession of the U.S. Army Remount Service, where he sired military horses for his remaining years. For the majority of his remount service, he was stationed at the Lookover Stallion Station in Avon, New York.\n\nThe chestnut gelding was enormous-being gelded to slow his growth to a staggering 17 hands.\n\nExterminator was not expected to run in the Derby, but had been a companion horse to the designated runner; however, as the race approached, his “trainee” horse developed ringbone.\n\nThe morning of the race, track deep in mud, he went off at 30-1.Exterminator raced at the back until the field turned for home, when he launched his bid. Nearing the wire, he passed Escoba and won the Derby by a length.\n\nRacing until the age of 9, a relatively old age for a race horse, Exterminator was called by his many fans “Old Bones” or “The Galloping Hatrack” (amongst the stable lads, he was “Old Shang”). He was retired in 1924 to a life of grass and leisure, with a succession of companion ponies, all named Peanuts, at his side.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known as the first winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nSir Barton was known for being a “grouchy” horse, and it was said that the only human he didn’t hate was his groom, Toots Thompson.\n\nSir Barton led the field of 12 horses from start to finish, winning the race by five lengths. The next day, Sir Barton was shipped to Baltimore to run in the Preakness Stakes, held only three days later on May 14. In the Preakness, he again led all the way, winning wire-to-wire and beating Eternal by four lengths. He then won the Withers Stakes in New York on May 24 and shortly thereafter completed the first Triple Crown in U.S. history by winning the Belmont Stakes on June 11, setting an American record for the mile and three-eighths race, the distance for the Belmont at the time. Sir Barton’s four wins were accomplished in a space of just 32 days.\n\nHe retired to stud, but died of colic on October 30, 1937.\n\nThe brown gelding is best known as the sixth gelding to win the Kentucky Derby. He was named after famous Admiral John Paul Jones and a popular brand of whiskey at the time.\n\nThe 1920 Kentucky Derby was run on an overcast day on a slow track with a field of seventeen horses. He won the race by a nose after staving off Upset, who showed impressive speed on the home stretch, and On Watch, who was a close third.\n\nPaul Jones raced for a total of five years and, being a gelding with no career at stud, was given to his trainer, William Garth, for use as an exercise pony. Garth spoke favorably of his former charge, complimenting the gelding’s gentle disposition and work ethic. Paul Jones was trained as a steeplechaser and as a hunter and rode him in fox hunts.\n\nPaul Jones was euthanized in April 1930 due to physical infirmities.\n\nThe black stallion is named “Black Gold” for his color and for the nickname of oil, which had recently been discovered in Oklahoma, where his owner, a member of the Osage Nation was from. He was nicknamed “The Indian Horse.”\n\nIn 1924, the Kentucky Derby was fifty years old and was celebrated as the “Golden Jubilee Derby.” It was the first time a golden cup was presented to the winner and the first time “My Old Kentucky Home” was played before the race. Black Gold won it with a rough trip against strong competition in the last seventy yards. He was bumped and was forced to check but recovered. Racing four and five wide, Black Gold overtook Chilhowee to win.\n\nBlack Gold was retired to stud but only sired one foal, a colt, that was killed by a lightning strike.\n\nOn January 18, 1928, at the age of seven, he started in the Salome Purse at the New Orleans Fair Grounds. In the stretch, he broke down and finished the race on three legs. He was euthanized at the track.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby with the first Canadian jockey in history to in the most prestigious race.\n\nHe was shipped to England to run his “British Campaign” in races there and did so successfully.\n\nTIME magazine reported on December 16, 1929 that his owner had turned down an offer of $1 million for Reigh Count, saying “I think a fellow who would pay $1,000,000 for a horse ought to have his head examined, and the fellow who turned it down must be absolutely unbalanced”. Had the offer been accepted, it would have been by far the largest amount ever paid for a race horse.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky.\n\nAlthough he was a son of Man o’ War, Clyde Van Dusen had an unimpressive appearance, being described as “a mere pony of a horse with a weedy frame.” Owner/breeder Herbert Gardner, named the horse after his trainer, former jockey Clyde Van Dusen. Van Dusen said, “Clyde is a little horse, and that is why Mr. Gardner named him after me.“\n\nThe Derby was run in a downpour, and Clyde Van Dusen was wearing mud caulks on the sloppy track. As a result, he was never seriously threatened and won by 2 lengths, with a time of 2:10 4/5, one of the slowest winning times in Derby history. After the race, Blue Larkspur’s owner, Colonel Edward R. Bradley, called Clyde Van Dusen “the worst horse to win the Derby in twenty years.” Clyde Van Dusen was the seventh gelding to win the Kentucky Derby in the race’s first 55 runnings.\n\nThe horse retired and Van Dusen used him as an exercise pony.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for being the second winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nEarly in his career, Gallant Fox was known for being distracted at times, supposedly being late out of the gate in his maiden race due to an airplane flying overhead. Gallant Fox also would become reluctant to run unless there was at least one other horse accompanying him. To help work him out, Fitzsimmons would have other horses placed around the track ahead of Gallant Fox, so he would chase after them.\n\nAfter winning the Preakness, two weeks later the Kentucky Derby attracted a crowd of 50,000 despite heavy rain at Louisville. He broke slowly but took the lead on the backstretch from the filly Alcibiades before winning by two lengths from Gallant Knight, completing the course in 2:07 3/5 on a muddy track.\n\nGallant Fox was known as “the red-headed horse” because of the bright red hood that he wore in the races; He retired to stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for forming the second father (Bubbling Over) and-son tandem to win the Derby. The feat had previously been accomplished by 1895 victor Halma and his son Alan-a-Dale, the 1902 winner.\n\nBurgoo King was named for James T. Looney, called the “Burgoo King” for his preparation of traditional Kentucky stew. Looney had prepared burgoo for Colonel Bradley’s charity race meeting for orphans in 1930, and Bradley told him that he would someday name a horse “Burgoo King” in Looney’s honor.\n\nThe Derby had a field of twenty starters, but Burgoo King got away cleanly. Shortly into the race stablemate Brother Joe pulled up lame. Although Burgoo King raced two wide with another horse behind the frontrunner, he made a strong move on the backstretch to take the lead and in the homestretch pulled away to win easily by three lengths.\n\nBurgoo King was broken to harness and trained from a sulky, however, he never quite recaptured his earlier form when returned to the track and was retired to stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion with a white blaze is best known as the third horse to win the Triple Crown. He stood 16.3 hands high.\n\nOmaha who was described as “a big, leggy, green thing that seems to invariably get into a lot of trouble”. Despite cold weather and heavy rain, the race attracted a crowd of 50,000 to Churchill Downs. His jockey kept Omaha clear of early trouble before moving the colt into the lead in the backstretch. Omaha was never seriously challenged and won by a length and a half without his jockey ever using his whip.\n\nAfter winning the Crown, he was shipped to England and had a truly astounding and memorable career on the right handed tracks.\n\nIn 1937, Omaha was found lame and never raced again.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nHe was ridden by an apprentice jockey in the Derby—a fist ever win by an apprentice.\n\nAs soon as the gates opened, Brevity was knocked to his knees, and the horse who would go on to win that year’s American Horse of the Year award, Granville, threw his rider, James Stout. Indian Broom was trapped in a scrum of racing horses. Bold Venture was in no better position. On the way out of the gate, another horse slammed into him, which was like, Hanford said: “…a bowling ball hitting the pins.” This started a chain reaction that caused Granville to throw Stout. But Bold Venture then found running room and by the backstretch had taken the lead. Then Brevity broke free of the pack and came charging after Bold Venture. However, Bold Venture crossed the finish line first.\n\nBold Venture bowed a tendon and was retired and sold to stud.\n\nThe brown stallion is best known for being the fourth winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nBecause of his size only 15.2 hands, one of War Admiral’s nicknames was The Mighty Atom.\n\nMost sources say that War Admiral also inherited his sire’s fiery temperament, which manifested chiefly in his reluctance to load in the starting gate. Away from the crowds though, he was more relaxed and given to taking long naps. His groom called him sweet.\n\nWar Admiral went off as the favorite, and, despite delaying the start for several minutes, won in wire-to-wire fashion with Pompoon 1+3⁄4 lengths back in second. Neville Dunn, sports editor for the Lexington Herald, wrote, “A little brown horse that takes after his mammy in size but runs like his daddy charged to victory in the 63rd Kentucky Derby… and he won so easily, so effortlessly, that 65,000 fans nudged one another in the ribs and said, ‘I told you so! I told you that War Admiral could run like Man o’ War.’”\n\nWar Admiral is on of most prolific leading American sire with numerous champion horses are from his pedigree.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby. He was owned by Ethel Mars, of the candy dynasty.\n\nGiven almost no chance, Gallahadion was sent off as a 36:1 longshot but under jockey Carroll Bierman scored an upset over Bimelech. For owner Ethel V. Mars, whom the May 9, 1940 Centralia Illinois Evening Sentinel reported had spent more than $500,000 buying horses since 1935 with the eye to winning the Derby.[2] Gallahadion was her eighth horse to run in the Derby in the past six years. Previously, Mrs. Mars’ best results came in 1935 and 1937 when her horses finished third. A severe cold kept her at home and she was not at Churchill Downs to see her horse capture the one race she had wanted to win most of all.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for being the fifth winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nWhirlaway was widely known as “Mr. Longtail” because his tail was especially long and thick and it would blow far out behind him during races, flowing dramatically in the wind.\n\nJimmy Jones, son of the colt’s trainer, recalled that “Whirlaway was a creature of habit. You had to create habits for him. So we created the habits we wanted him to do.” Whirlaway was regarded as having a “quirky” personality. The champion colt had a habit of “bearing out,” drifting toward the middle of the racetrack, during the latter part of his races and losing as a result. In preparations for the Kentucky Derby, this had been such a problem that trainer Ben A. Jones fitted the colt with a full-cup blinker over his right eye. In Whirlaway’s final workout before the Derby, Jones cut a small hole in the blinker so that the horse had a tiny field of vision. Jones positioned himself ten feet off the inner rail and told jockey Eddie Arcaro to ride the horse through that space. Whirlaway was able to see his trainer, Arcaro was able to keep him on a straight path, and Whirlaway won the Kentucky Derby by tying the current (as of 2018) record margin of 8 lengths.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for being the sixth winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nCount Fleet was not a particularly attractive horse, called “narrow, light-waisted, and flat-muscled” by one expert and too leggy and light boned by others. He also had an unruly temperament.\n\nThe 1943 Kentucky Derby was almost not run because of wartime restrictions, but Colonel Matt Winn organized it as a “street-car Derby” – restricting travel for out-of-state residents and not allowing cars be driven to the event. Despite this, some 60,000 people attended the race and made Count Fleet the 2-5 favorite – the shortest starting price in Derby history. Count Fleet broke well and challenged Gold Shower, Burnt Shower and Blue Swords for the early lead. After a quarter mile, Count Fleet found himself boxed by the other horses but broke free moving into the first turn. He then moved up to challenge Gold Shower for the lead on the first turn and opened up a two-length lead down the backstretch. On the far turn, Blue Swords mounted a challenge and closed to within a length. Longden then clucked to Count Fleet, who quickly opened a three-length advantage and won handily.\n\nCount Fleet had a series of injuries in the races, often striking his front ankles with his back hooves. He retired early.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for two legs of the Triple Crown, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. In fact, Pensive was the first Kentucky Derby/Preakness Stakes winner to start in the Belmont Stakes but lose the Triple Crown.\n\nPensive had a muscular body and slightly short legs for his height. He did not have the best of feet. He did his best running from off the pace and was described as being “resolute” when set down for a drive. He was retired in the fall of 1944 due to tendon problems, which may have begun when he rapped an ankle while winning the Preakness Stakes.\n\nPensive’s Derby may have had the widest viewership of any Kentucky Derby up to that time as it was filmed in color for distribution for showings to American military personnel serving all over the globe during World War II.\n\nThe ,chestnut stallion is best known for being the seventh winner of the Triple Crown and the only Texas-bred winner.\n\nDescribed as being “on the delicate side” Assault was plagued with injuries and illnesses from the start. As a youngster, he stepped on what is believed to have been a surveyor’s stake, driving it through his front right hoof. The hoof was permanently deformed, and the colt developed a limp to accommodate the odd shape of his foot; however, the “Club-footed Comet”, as he was later dubbed, showed no signs of abnormality when he was at a full gallop. Throughout his career, Assault also overcame kidney, splint bone, fetlock, knee and bleeding problems.\n\nIn the Derby, he raced past rivals to take the first race of the Triple Crown by eight lengths, the largest margin of victory up to that time. At the Preakness Stakes a week later, aggravated by traffic early in the race, his jockey decided to push Assault earlier than usual. He was four lengths in front with a furlong to go. The tiring Assault scored a neck victory over Lord Boswell.\n\nAfter stumbling at the start of the Belmont Stakes, Assault trailed the field throughout much of the race. In the final 200 yards, he moved past the leaders to win the Belmont by three lengths.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for being the eight winner of the Triple Crown and was the first horse in history to win US$1 million.\n\nIn the Kentucky Derby, Citation won by 31⁄2 lengths Citation was then sent to Baltimore where he won the Preakness Stakes by 51⁄2 lengths. There was a 4-week gap between the Preakness and Belmont and Citation’s trainer thought he should run in a race during that time as a “warm-up” for Cy’s Belmont. Citation ran in the Jersey Stakes which he won by an easy 11 lengths. After winning the Belmont stakes, Citation became the eighth Triple Crown winner by winning it by 8 lengths and tying the stakes record of 2:281⁄5 set by the sixth Triple Crown winner, Count Fleet.\n\nHe retired to stud and was said to be afraid of the farm owner’s Yorkshire Terrier Timmy Tammy. The dog reportedly nipped at him on several occasions.\n\nAround the time of Citation’s death, a marketing executive at Cessna Aircraft Company, convinced chairman Dwane Wallace to use Citation’s name for the new business jet Cessna was designing. Cessna has continued to use the Citation name and trademark horseshoe logo for an entire series of jet aircraft that comprise the Cessna Citation family.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby in the first live TV broadcast across America.\n\nWhen Hill Gail began to misbehave in the paddock before the race, Ben Jones reportedly calmed the horse by punching him on the nose. Eddie Arcaro sent the colt to the front after half a mile and Hill Gail produced what was described as a “stupendous burst of speed” to open up a six length advantage by the time the runners rounded the final turn. The outsider Sub Fleet emerged as a challenger in the stretch and Arcaro had to resort to his whip to ensure that Hill Gail reached the wire two lengths in front of Sub Fleet, with the second favorite Blue Man in third. The win gave Arcaro a record fifth Kentucky Derby, whilst trainer Ben Jones was winning the race for a sixth time, also a record. The winning time of 2:01 3/5 was the second fastest time to date. Hill Gail sustained a leg injury in the Derby which prevented him from running in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.\n\nHe was retired to stand as a breeding stallion in Ireland, where he had limited success as a sire.\n\nThe brown stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn the Derby, Dark Star started at odds of 25/1, with Native Dancer, unbeaten in eleven races, going off the 3/5 favorite. Apart from the crowd at the track, the race attracted a huge television audience, with three-quarters of American viewers tuning in to the coverage. Dark Star broke quickly from a wide draw and was sent into the lead at the first turn by his twenty-three-year-old jockey Hank Moreno, staying clear of the “bumping and pushing” further back in the field, in which the favorite was badly affected. As the field turned into the straight, Dark Star broke away from his nearest challenger, the Eddie Arcaro-ridden Correspondent, to open a clear lead. Native Dancer produced a powerful late run, but Dark Star held on to win by a head. The winning time was 2:02.0. After the race, Moreno confessed to being surprised by Dark Star’s effort, saying that he had “hoped to run third”.\n\nIn the book “Horse Racing’s Top 100 Moments” by the staff of Blood-Horse Publications, Dark Star’s defeat of Native Dancer was ranked number 21.\n\nHe retired to stand at stud.\n\nThe gray stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby-the first gray horse to do so.\n\nDetermine, a soft gray in color, grew to a little over fifteen hands and never weighed more than 900 pounds. At the time of his Derby win he was described in the press as being a “pint-sized colt” and “a little package of dynamite”.\n\nRight out of the gate, York (his jockey) was almost unseated. Timely Tip, who had won the Arkansas Derby, cut over badly from the outside. In what Churchill Downs describes as one of the roughest Derby’s ever run, Determine stayed on his feet, and York stayed in the saddle. Hasty Road was well in the lead, but Determine caught him 1/16 of a mile from the finish and won by a length and a half, becoming the first gray to win the Derby.\n\nDetermine retired to successful stud career.\n\nThe British born dark bay stallion is best known for being only the second non-American bred horse to ever win the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAt two, Tomy Lee stood 16 hands, weighed a bit over a thousand pounds, and was sound. The press called the bay with four white stockings a greyhound, slim and perfectly proportioned.\n\nEarly on in the race, Tomy Lee was involved in a speed duel with Troilus, and won it, so when Sword Dancer made his move under Bill Boland, Shoemaker thought Tomy Lee was spent and Sword Dancer might take the Derby. Seeing Boland come up, he called, “Good luck, I hope you win it.” Sword Dancer took over the lead by half a length, but Tomy Lee came on again in mid stretch, behind by only a head. The horses bumped several times. At the wire, Tomy Lee won by a nose. Boland claimed a foul, but the judges disallowed it after deliberating for 17 minutes.\n\nHe continued racing until 1963 and was retired to stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby. He was named after a street in Miami Beach.\n\nIn the 1960 Kentucky Derby- the “drugstore Derby”- Venetian Way beat Bally Ache. Venetian Way was a sore horse who responded admirably to Butazolidin, legal in Kentucky at the time. When Venetian Way ran in the Preakness two weeks later without the help of Butazolidin (pain-killing drugs are not legal in Maryland), he did not finish in the money while the sound-legged Bally Ache won. The performance of Venetian Way with and without Butazolidin and other similar cases convinced the Kentucky State Racing Commission that drugs were unfair to the horse and to the public.\n\nRidden in the Kentucky Derby by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey Bill Hartack, Venetian Way remained within striking distance, then passed Bally Ache as they came around the final turn heading into the homestretch and won going away by 3½ lengths. In the ensuing 1960 Preakness Stakes, Venetian Way finished fifth to winner Bally Ache.\n\nThe dark brown stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nAs a three-year-old, Carry Back was described by an Associated Press reporter as a “little, scrawny” horse who weighed no more than 970 pounds. The horse was sometimes referred to by the nicknames “C. B.” and “The People’s Choice”.\n\nIn the Derby, Carry Back started predictably slowly and was towards the rear, sixteen lengths behind the leaders in the early stages as Globemaster led from Four-and-Twenty and Crozier. Sellers began to move forward in the backstretch and brought the colt around the outside of the field before making his challenge in the stretch. Carry Back produced what reporters described as a “devastating stretch run” to catch Crozier in the closing stages and win by three quarters of a length. The slow winning time of 2:04.00 was accounted for by the “sticky” track conditions.\n\nHe had several retirements and comebacks and lived to be one of the oldest of the Derby winners.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.\n\nAfter running in sixth place through the first three-quarters of a mile, coming out of the backstretch Chateaugay moved to the far outside and raced into fourth place. As they turned for home, jockey Braulio Baeza spotted an opening between the second- and third-place horses. He raced through it to pull alongside Never Bend and then moved ahead to win the race by 1+1⁄4 lengths.\n\nA well-balanced golden chestnut horse who appeared smaller than he actually was, Chateaugay stood 16.1 hands. He had a shorter back and more close-coupled build than his sire Swaps. His legs were correct except for a slight tendency toward tied-in tendons, but he had a rather mulish head. He had an excellent shoulder, short cannons, good feet and good length from hip to hock, affording him considerable leverage in his stride. He was not always inclined to give his best on the racetrack and was not an easy ride. He did his best running from off the pace. His temperament issues may have been related to his numerous physical problems: he was hampered by respiratory issues that delayed his entry to racing until fall of his 2-year-old season, and he was also troubled by a splint between his juvenile and 3-year-old seasons and at 4 and 5 by an ankle injury suffered late in his 3-year-old season.\n\nHe was sold to Japanese interests and retired to stud in Japan.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nA deep-bodied bay horse standing 15.3 hands, Lucky Debonair had a good shoulder, good bone and short cannons but had a bit too much angulation in his pasterns. He was too backward for much juvenile racing and ended up making only one unplaced start at 2 in which he bucked his shins. He bucked shins again and also ran down on his right heel while running in the 1965 Preakness Stakes and was sidelined by splints for the remainder of the year. He was retired due to another injury following his 1966 Santa Anita Handicap win. He had a kind and willing disposition and could be placed anywhere in a race as his jockey desired. His one fault as a racer was a tendency to pull himself up after making the lead.\n\nLucky Debonair’s Kentucky Derby day was enlivened by a fire caused by a stray cigarette in the clubhouse next to the first turn, about two hours before post time. Flames shot 10 feet into the air before being extinguished, and post time was put back by 30 minutes to allow the soaked section of the track to be gotten back into racing order.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.\n\nAfter running in sixth place through the first three-quarters of a mile, coming out of the backstretch Chateaugay moved to the far outside and raced into fourth place. As they turned for home, jockey Braulio Baeza spotted an opening between the second- and third-place horses. He raced through it to pull alongside Never Bend and then moved ahead to win the race by 1+1⁄4 lengths.\n\nA well-balanced golden chestnut horse who appeared smaller than he actually was, Chateaugay stood 16.1 hands.

He possessed the powerful hindquarters of his sire, Native Dancer, but also had his sire’s rather suspicious-looking ankles. His temperament as a racehorse was sensible. While he preferred to run on or near the lead, he rated well and had a good turn of foot when needed. He was completely genuine in a drive. He had a rather rounded running gait resembling his sire’s. Kauai King stumbled at the break of the 1966 Arlington Classic (a race that his trainer had not wanted to run him in) and bowed a tendon, ending his racing career.\n\nOwner Mike Ford explained that he gave Kauai King his name because Kaua’i was the one island not conquered by Kamehameha I when he united the inhabited islands of Hawai’i under a single monarchy. (After two failed invasion attempts by Kamehameha, Kaua’i’s ruler, Kaumuali’i, elected to submit voluntarily to Kamehameha’s authority rather than face a third possible invasion; he retained the rulership of Kaua’i as Kamehameha’s vassal.) Ford’s hope was that his colt would prove as unconquerable as Kaua’i.\n\nKauai King’s barn name was “Old George.”\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nProud Clarion was a well-built, rather leggy individual of classic type. His fetlock joints were weak and he was not the soundest of runners. He was nervous and a poor doer as a juvenile but became calmer and a better eater as he matured.\n\nProud Clarion’s Derby took place in a tense atmosphere occasioned by earlier civil rights protests in the Louisville area. Because of the potential for riots, several Derby Week activities were canceled including the Pegasus Parade and a country music concert, and the Kentucky National Guard was called out to bolster the Louisville Police Department and a contingent of Kentucky State Police at the Derby.\n\nAnother disruption was caused by the University of Louisville, which refused to send its band to play “My Old Kentucky Home” for the post parade after receiving threats from an anonymous caller. Two other schools also refused to send their bands for similar reasons, and members of the Louisville Musician Union filled in at the last minute.\n\nAt the race, leaving the starting gate from post position seven, Proud Clarion raced ninth near the back in a pack of horses until close to the ¾ mile pole when jockey Bobby Ussery made a move. By the mile pole he was sitting fifth then in the homestretch accelerated through an opening between Damascus and Diplomat Way. He caught front-runner Barbs Delight then raced on to win by a length in the third-fastest time in the Derby’s history to that point.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMajestic Prince drew the last post position. Arts and Letters, racing along the rail, took the lead by the time they reached the mile pole and were about to head for the stretch run. Majestic Prince ran the entire race on the outside, but pulled up alongside Arts and Letters into second place as they came down the homestretch, then moved ahead to win by a neck. The victory made Majestic Prince the first unbeaten Kentucky Derby champion in 47 years.\n\nThe horse had a developing tendon injury and did not run in the Preakness despite grueling pressure and disbelief. Majestic Prince returned to run in the Belmont, but the jockey said that the horse was hurting and never should have run.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes and was owned by Venezuelan breeders.\n\nIn the Derby’s 20-horse field, Canonero II shocked everyone by coming from 18th place to storm past the competition, easily winning the race by 33⁄4 lengths. Arguably the most astonishing upset in the race’s history was deemed a fluke by many of horse racing’s experts, who predicted Canonero II would never win another race. However, in the Preakness Stakes, the second of the Triple Crown races, Canonero II won again.\n\nThe third leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, was run before the largest crowd in its history. The stands were filled with members of the city’s large Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Canonero II, after taking the race lead, struggled across the finish line in fourth place. Despite this loss, he was named the winner of the 1971 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.\n\nRiva Ridge was a light bay stallion who stood 16 hands high. Riva Ridge’s name came from Chenery’s daughter Penny and her husband, John Tweedy, honoring their favorite ski run at Vail, Colorado. Tweedy had trained with the U.S. Army’s Tenth Mountain Division in Colorado in 1943, but later served in Burma with the OSS. Upon his return from the war, he and fellow veterans from the Tenth Mountain division founded Vail Ski Resort in Colorado in 1962. They named the longest run “Riva Ridge” after a costly but important strategic victory by the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division on February 18 in the North Apennine mountains of Italy.\n\nRiva Ridge was described by Penny Chenery as a very timid and unassuming horse who “ran to get away from [other horses].” He was nicknamed “Old Pea Head” while racing.\n\nThe morning of the Kentucky Derby, larger holes were cut in Riva Ridge’s blinkers because it would help the horse should he need to go to the front early in the race. In the Derby, the other jockeys held their horses back early on, as Turcotte expected, and Riva Ridge took the lead early, holding it throughout the race to win by 3+1⁄4 lengths.\n\nRiva Ridge’s winnings as a two saved the Meadow Stable, paving the way for stablemate, Secretariat.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for being the ninth winner of the Triple Crown. His nickname was “Big Red”.\n\nSecretariat grew into a massive, powerful horse said to resemble his sire’s maternal grandsire, Discovery. He stood 16.2 hands when fully grown. He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, described as having “nearly perfect” conformation and stride biomechanics. His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, “He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. I never saw anything like him.“\n\nSecretariat obliterated the records at the three racetracks and became a celebrity—which he remains today!\n\nSecretariat died of laminitis. His owner remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death.\n\nThe dark bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.\n\nRidden by Angel Cordero, he led the Derby from the start, setting a “blistering pace”, and won by half a length from the 2/5 favorite Honest Pleasure.\n\nIn the Preakness Stakes Bold Forbes again took an early lead and set an exceptionally fast pace, but after a prolonged battle with Honest Pleasure, both horses tired in the final stages and were beaten by Elocutionist, with Bold Forbes finishing third.\n\nIn the Belmont Stakes, Bold Forbes again led from the start and won by a neck from McKenzie Bridge with Great Contractor a further neck away in third.\n\nHe was retired to stand stud. Until his death, he was the oldest living Kentucky Derby winner. He died on August 9, 2000, at the age of 27 after being humanely euthanized due to renal failure and complications from gastroenteritis.\n\nThe dark bay stallion with a white patch of hair by his left rear hoof, is best known for being the 10th winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nAs a foal, Seattle Slew’s looks were compared to a mule. He was so awkward he was nicknamed Baby Huey. He was named him for the city of Seattle and the sloughs loggers used to transport heavy logs. Slough-a slow-moving channel of the Pacific Northwest —was changed to Slew.\n\nAt the Derby, Seattle Slew washed out in the paddock and again during the post parade. The jockey moved him away from the crowd to relax. He had drawn post position three, and had to wait in the starting gate for the rest of the field to load. Slew reacted slowly at the break then swerved nearly sideways and found himself trapped near the back of the field. He charged through the field, bumping several other horses who were in his way. After two furlongs, he had worked his way into second place. The two colts dueled before Seattle Slew relaxed down the backstretch, under a tight restraint, allowing For the Moment to open up a lead of a length. At the top of the stretch, the jockey went to the whip and Seattle Slew pulled away by 4 lengths, then shut down in the final eighth of a mile to win by 1+3⁄4 lengths. Seattle Slew was visibly upset after the race. “It was the only time I was scared of him,” said his groom. “He was so high-strung that night, he was evil, just evil. I couldn’t believe how wound tight he was. It was like he hadn’t even been in a race. I had to take him from the hotwalker and he ran over me a couple of times. I’d never seen him like that before.”\n\nSeattle Slew retired to stud, leaving a legacy of winners. He underwent spinal fusion surgery for a neurological condition in 2000, followed by a second surgery in 2002. Upon recovery from the second surgery,\n\nOn May 7, 2002, 25 years to the day after he won the Kentucky Derby, Seattle Slew died in his sleep at age 28.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for is best known for being the 11th winner of the Triple Crown.\n\nAt the start of the Kentucky Derby, Sensitive Prince took the early lead as Affirmed ran in third, while Alydar stayed far back. Affirmed made a strong move for the lead on the far turn, put away a challenge by Believe It, and held off Alydar’s fast-closing charge to win by 1+1⁄2 lengths.\n\nIn the Preakness Stakes, Affirmed set the pace. Alydar made his big move on the far turn, Affirmed held a short lead entering the stretch and held it to defeat Alydar by a neck.\n\nIn the Belmont, Affirmed led and set a very slow pace, going the first quarter mile in 25 seconds and the half in 50 seconds. Alydar’s jockey put Alydar close to the pace and moved alongside Affirmed with more than seven furlongs to go. For more than six) furlongs, the colts raced neck and neck, pulling away from the rest of the field. Alydar got his nose in front at mid-stretch, but just as Affirmed appeared to tire, his jockey went to a left-handed whip, something he hadn’t done before in his eight rides on Affirmed. Affirmed won by a nose.\n\nHe had a successful stud career. In 2001, Affirmed was euthanized after falling seriously ill with laminitis, a circulatory hoof disease.\n\nThe very dark grey stallion, that became dappled as he aged, is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. He lived on the Eastern Shore!\n\nSpectacular Bid seemed nervous before the start of the Derby, but his trainer was so confident of victory that as the horse paraded in front of the fans, he called, “Go bet! Go bet!” Spectacular Bid was restrained by the jockey in the early stages before moving up on the outside to take the lead on the far turn. He drew clear in the straight and won by 2+3⁄4 lengths over General Assembly, with Golden Act in third.\n\nIn the Preakness, he was bumped early, he ran wide and by the final stretch was in command. He handily won the race, outpacing his competitors to win by 5+1⁄2 lengths. His time of 1:54.2 was faster than that of Seattle Slew or Affirmed,\n\nOn the morning of the Belmont Stakes, a freak accident was discovered: Spectacular Bid had stepped on a safety pin. The pin had become embedded in his hoof, later leading to an infection that required the hoof to be drilled to cure the problem. However, after the discovery of the injury, Spectacular Bid did not seem lame and was entered into the race and lost.\n\nHe was retired to stud. Spectacular Bid died from a heart attack on June 9, 2003.\n\nThe chestnut filly is best known for being the 2nd mare to win the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAs the field rounded the final turn at Churchill Downs, as the crash of more than 130,000 people cheering greeted their entrance into the stretch, the jockey urged Genuine Risk to pass Rockhill Native and Plugged Nickle and take the lead. She zipped past them, the jockey switching to his left hand to tap her with his whip. As Genuine Risk worked to put space between her and the field, Rumbo and Jaklin Klugman threatened with late charges at the filly, but to no avail: Genuine Risk had won the Kentucky Derby by one length, only the second filly in history to beat her male peers and wear the blanket of roses.\n\nShe is the only filly in history to race in three events of the Triple Crown. Her finish in the Preakness was disputed as the winning jockey was said to interfere with her, even hitting her in the face with his crop. She placed 2nd in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.\n\nShe retired as a broodmare and at the age of 31, she died in her paddock at the Firestone family’s Virginia-based Newstead Farm on Monday, August 18, 2008.\n\nThe grey stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nGiven little chance by Churchill Downs bettors against the favored Wood Memorial Stakes winner Air Forbes Won, Gato Del Sol was sent off at odds of 21-1, the third longest in the race. He trailed the nineteen-horse field in the 1¼ mile race early but under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye began making a move after half a mile. By the mile pole, he had moved up to fifth place. He continued to gain ground as the field moved down the homestretch, with six horses spread across the track racing head-to-head. By the final furlong marker, Gato Del Sol had moved to the lead by a half-length and then pulled away to win by 2½ lengths. He paid $44.40 to win, the 10th highest payoff in Derby history.\n\nHe was retired to stud, but proved unsuccessful. He was sold to a breeding operation in Germany, but was bought back by his owners to prevent him from going to a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe dark brown stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes in 1984. He died eight days after his win in the latter race.\n\nOn June 17, 1984, eight days after the Belmont Stakes, Swale collapsed and died en route to his stall following a bath.\n\nA statement issued by the New Bolton Center of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Science, where extended tests had been run on samples and organs from Swale’s body, said that an area of fibrosis on his heart had been discovered in recent days. The statement said that “Dr. Helen Acland, the center’s head pathologist, had found a very small area of fibrosis below the aortic valve and that lesions of this type can produce an arrhythmia in the heart, which can be fatal.”\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMuch to the outrage of many horse racing enthusiasts, reports indicate that in 2002, Ferdinand was sent to slaughter in Japan with no fanfare or notice to previous owners. He likely became either pet food or steaks for human consumption. Ferdinand’s death was the catalyst for the Ferdinand Fee, an optional donation program to fund keeping old racehorses alive, and Friends of Ferdinand, a nonprofit group formed in 2005 with the goal of transitioning retired racehorses into second careers.\n\nIn September 2006, the United States House of Representatives approved H.R. 503, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, which would ban the slaughter of horses in the United States. The bill did not make it out of committee in the Senate, however. In January 2007, the bill was reintroduced. As of 2012, the act has not been passed into law.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.\n\nIn the Derby, he and jockey Chris McCarron were nearly knocked to the ground at the top of the stretch by Bet Twice. Alysheba recovered from the collision and won the Derby in a slow time of 2:034⁄5 for 11⁄4 miles. He then came back with another win in the Preakness Stakes, then attempted to become American racing’s 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nHe retired to stud in the King of Saudi Arabia’s Royal Stables, before being returned home to the US.\n\nOn Friday, March 27, 2009, at 11:13 pm, Alysheba was euthanized “Due to a chronic degenerative spinal condition that led to ataxia and instability, Alysheba fell in his stall yesterday, injuring his right hind femur,” said Kathy Hopkins, the Horse Park’s director of equine operations. “Complicated by his advanced age, this trauma resulted in severe pain that did not respond to analgesic therapy. The resulting pain and suffering, and the inability to stand unaided, led to a joint decision for euthanasia.”\n\nThe black stallion, with a white blaze on his face, is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nHe was bred by Oak Cliff Thoroughbreds, Ltd. and escaped death twice: first as a weanling when he nearly died from a freak virus;[and later at age two, traveling in a van when the driver experienced a heart attack and the van flipped over.\n\nKentucky Derby day was a cold one at 44°, the coldest in 72 years, with rain creating a slow muddy track. After stalking the pace and making his move around the turn, Sunday Silence defeated Easy Goer by 2+1⁄2 lengths, in the slowest time (2:05) for a Kentucky Derby since 1958. Sunday Silence ducked in and out sharply throughout the stretch run, with his jockey switching from left and right-handed urging trying to keep him running straight. Even with ducking in and out, the champion Easy Goer was unable to make up ground.\n\nThe 1989 Preakness Stakes is one that continues to live in racing lore as one of the best races ever run, and one of the most iconic stretch duels. Easy Goer broke slow, and Sunday Silence was bumped at the start, then the pair settled in. After ¾ of a mile, Day guided Easy Goer to the front where Sunday Silence dug in and went with him. The legendary stretch duel was fought the entire length of the stretch, with neither Sunday Silence or Easy Goer giving an inch. Sunday Silence prevailed in the photo finish, with a finishing time of 1:53 4/5, the third fastest Preakness at the time.\n\nThe bay stallion, with a broad white blaze, is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHe won the Kentucky Derby, by 3½ lengths. When Unbridled won the Derby, a network television camera in the Churchill Downs stands captured his trainer, Carl Nafzger, giving the horse’s elderly owner, Frances Genter, a stretch call because of her poor vision. Nafzger shouted, “He’s going to win! He’s going to win! Oh, Mrs. Genter, I love you!“\n\nUnbridles retired to a very successful stud career.\n\nIn September 2001, Unbridled underwent two operations to be treated for intestinal issues. He underwent his first surgery on September 21, where three feet of his intestine was removed. Five days removed from the first surgery, he suffered a setback, and underwent a second surgery on September 26. Unbridled recovered again and was sent home to Claiborne Farm on October 8. On October 19, 2001, at 6:00 PM, Unbridled was euthanized at the clinic after a severe bout of colic, with his condition being deemed inoperable.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHe was said to have barely survived birth and was born a “dummy foal”, which is a condition that creates a lack of oxygen to the brain. He was on oxygen for the first three days of his life. He was orphaned at four months when his mother, Majestic Gold, died of colic.\n\nStrike the Gold, the son of the great sire Alydar, charged late and wide to win horse racing’s 117th Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe chestnut colt was 12th among 16 horses down the backside. He circled the field around the home turn and charged six-wide down the stretch to win the 1 -mile first leg of thoroughbred racing’s hallowed Triple Crown by 1 length.\n\nHe was retired to stud, then sold to a Turkish breeder.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby in possibly the biggest upset in the history of the Derby.\n\nAs a weanling, Lil E. Tee nearly died but was saved by emergency stomach surgery. Considered to have little racing potential, he was sold for $2,000 as a yearling. When he was two, his owner tried to sell him again but was rejected by an auction company that deemed the horse unsaleable. Lil E. Tee ended up in the hands of a Florida owner.\n\nStarting in post position #10, Lil E. Tee got off to a clean start and was in tenth place after half a mile. Arazi, who had started on the far outside in post position #17, made an explosive move. ABC television announcer Dave Johnson exclaimed “Arazi is flying” as the colt went seven wide, sweeping past horse after horse to move into third place, tightly bunched with the leaders. Lil E. Tee followed Arazi, moving into 5th place. As they approached the home stretch, though, Arazi tired badly. Lil E. Tee made his move and soon caught the front-running Casual Lies to win the most prestigious race in America and $724,800.\n\nOn June 9, the colt’s racing season ended when he underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from his front ankles.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe 120th Kentucky Derby was held on May 7, 1994, over a sloppy track. Go for Gin entered the race at 9.10:1 odds, behind Holy Bull at 2.20, Brocco at 4.30, Tabasco Cat at 6.10, and Strodes Creek at 7.90. He started by ducking out, forcing Tabasco Cat into Brocco. By the 1/4 mile pole, Go for Gin moved up to second place behind Ulises. At the 1/2 mile pole, he led by half a length. As he entered the stretch, he increased the lead to four lengths. Strodes Creek and Blumin Affair both made late charges, closing the gap, but Go for Gin won by two lengths, Go for Gin placed second in the other legs of the Triple Crown.\n\nIn 1995, Go for Gin suffered a small tear of a tendon sheath in his left foreleg while working out at Belmont Park. This precipitated his retirement to stud. He died from heart failure on March 8, 2022, at the age of 30.\n\nThe grey stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nSilver Charm drew the sixth post position out of a field of 13 and broke well at the starting gate. He came out between other horses going into the backstretch and took the lead with less than a furlong to go. He won the Derby, finishing a head in front of Captain Bodgit.\n\nSilver Charm won the Preakness Stakes in the same manner, pulling ahead of Captain Bodgit and Free House just before the wire.\n\nHe was retired to stud, then sold to Japan and the buy-back clause was enacted and he retired to Old Friends Farm in Kentucky.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. He was nicknamed “The Fish” by his trainer due to his narrow frame.\n\nThe fierce competition from rivals such as Victory Gallop added to the intensity of the prestigious event. In a heart-stopping finish down the stretch, Real Quiet surged ahead with grit and determination to claim victory by a narrow margin—securing his place in horse racing history as one of the most memorable champions ever seen at “the Run for Roses.”\n\nReal Quiet died as the result of a paddock accident at Penn Ridge Farms in Harrisburg, Pa., according to the farm’s owner, Michael Jester.\n\nJester said that farm personnel found Real Quiet in his paddock, and that the horse had fractured several cervical vertebrae. Real Quiet was unable to get up and had to be euthanized.\n\nDoctors at the New Bolton Center in Kennett Square, Pa., had determined on Tuesday that Real Quiet had fallen on his shoulder, driving the shoulder bone into the vertebra, Jester said. A search of his paddock did not turn up any marks in the grass or fencing to indicate how the injury had occurred, Jester said.\n\n“He had to have reared up, slipped, and fell on his left shoulder, and that drove the bone into the back,” Jester said.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nCharismatic was a 31-1 longshot in the Derby, facing a field of 18 other horses. Valhol set a slow early pace tracked by Cat Thief, who took over the lead rounding the final turn. Charismatic raced in mid-pack for the first three-quarters of a mile, then started closing ground rapidly on the leaders. He passed Cat Thief in deep stretch, then withstood a late charge from Menifee to win by a head.\n\nCharismatic also won the Preakness Stakes 1½ lengths ahead of Menifee,\n\nAfter winning the Derby and Preakness, Charismatic had the lead in the stretch of the Belmont Stakes before suddenly falling back and finishing third. He was quickly pulled up by jockey Chris Antley, who dismounted and cradled the horse’s fractured foreleg to prevent further injury. Charismatic’s foreleg had fractured in multiple places involving the cannon bone and sesamoids, and Antley’s actions probably saved his life by avoiding a more catastrophic injury. The horse was taken off the track in a van and underwent surgery the next day.\n\nThe footage of a tearful Antley holding Charismatic was selected by racing fans as the 1999 National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe colt was purchased as a yearling for $4 million by Fusao Sekiguchi, which is the highest price paid for a Kentucky Derby winner. His name is a combination of his owner’s name, “Fusao”, and the Japanese word for one, “ichi”, to mean No. 1 or the best; the second half of his name came from that of a winged horse in Greek mythology. He was nicknamed “Fu Peg“.\n\nFusaichi Pegasus won the 2000 Kentucky Derby in a time of 2:01.12 for the 11⁄4 mile distance. At the time, it was the seventh fastest time in Kentucky Derby history; by the time of his death, it was the tenth fastest time. He was the first favorite to win the Kentucky Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979 and the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby without winning a race as a two-year-old since Proud Clarion in 1967.\n\nHe was retired to stud in Ireland, Australia, Chile, and Uruguay.\n\nThe gray stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAt Churchill Downs, Monarchos was the 10.5/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Derby. After being bumped at the start, he made steady progress on the outside and turned into the straight in sixth place. Chavez sent the gray colt to the lead a furlong from the finish, and Monarchos pulled clear to win by almost five lengths from Invisible Ink, with Congaree third and the favored Point Given fifth.\n\nMonarchos’ winning time was 1:59.97 for 1+1⁄4 miles, becoming only the third horse in Derby history to finish the race in under 2 minutes, joining 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat, who ran 1:59 2⁄5, and his runner up, Sham, who ran 1:59 4⁄5 (at that time, the Derby was timed to the fifth of a second rather than to the hundredth of a second). As of 2022, no horse since Monarchos has broken the 2-minute barrier at the Derby.\n\nHe retired to stud. On October 22, 2016, Monarchos died after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured intestine. He went into surgery after showing signs of internal distress the night before. He was 18 years old at the time of his death.[\n\nThe dark bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Often described as nearly black, he was registered as dark bay or brown colt with a white star.\n\nDescribed as narcissistic, War Emblem was a temperamental horse who did not like people nor other horses: Bob Baffert nicknamed the colt ‘Hannibal Lecter’ for his habit of biting. He had a history of bone chips in his knees and ankles, which discouraged several potential buyers. He liked to race at the front of the field, but sometimes compromised his own chances by acting up in the starting gate.\n\nVictor Espinoza was his jockey for the Derby, never having seen the horse until the morning of the race. War Emblem, who went off at 21-to-1 odds, took the early lead and sent sensible early fractions, then kicked away from the field in the stretch.\n\nHe was sold to a Japanese racing family to stand stud. He was resold to Old Friends Equine Retirement where he was gelded. War Emblem was found dead in his paddock at the age of 21. The cause of death was later found to be a ruptured small intestine.[\n\nThe chestnut gelding is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. He is also the first New York bred horse to win.\n\nBumped again at the start, Funny Cide tracked the early pace set by Peace Rules, and moved to the lead heading into the stretch. Empire Maker then started closing fast but Funny Cide was able to hold on by 1+1⁄2 lengths. “I hit him and he kept digging and digging and he did it,” said Santos. “It was New York pride.” Funny Cide’s time of 2:01.19 was the tenth fastest time in Kentucky Derby history.\n\nAfter retirement, Funny Cide’s future career would be as a stable pony in the mornings, accompanying younger horses in their training. “He’ll still be doing what he’s done the past five years, but he just won’t be racing in the afternoon“.\n\nFunny Cide died due to complications of colic on July 16, 2023, at the age of 23. He resided at the Kentucky Horse Park for the last 15 years of his life.\n\nThe gray stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby at 50-1 odds. The horse, named for the rock star Sting’s 9-year-old son, was ridden by Mike Smith, who, at long last, grabbed his first Derby victory in his 12th attempt.\n\nGiacomo, ridden by Mike E. Smith, won the 2005 Kentucky Derby in a time of 2:02.75. At odds of 50–1, Giacomo stands as tied, with Mine That Bird in 2009, for the fourth-biggest longshot ever to win the Derby, trailing only Country House (horse), at 65–1 in 2019, Rich Strike at 80-1 in 2022, and Donerail, who went off at 91–1 in 1913.\n\nHe retired to stud at a farm in Oregon.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby but shattered his leg two weeks later in the Preakness Stakes which ended his racing career and eventually led to the decision to euthanize him.\n\nBarbaro’s Preakness Stakes began with a false start when he broke from the starting gate prematurely. Barbaro was deemed fit upon being reloaded into the gate. As the restarted race began, Barbaro broke cleanly, but suffered a catastrophic injury as the horses passed the grandstand shortly after the start.\n\nBarbaro broke his right hind leg in more than 20 places: a broken cannon bone above the pastern, a broken sesamoid bone behind the fetlock and a broken long pastern bone below the fetlock. The fetlock joint was dislocated, and his foot was left dangling loosely. Veteran jockey Edgar Prado immediately pulled Barbaro up and brought him to a gentle stop. He dismounted and leaned his shoulder into the horse’s shoulder to support Barbaro until track attendants could arrive. He underwent numerous surgeries but ultimately suffered numerous complications.\n\nIn 2006, a Limited Edition Ty Beanie Babies Barbaro Beanie plushie was released. The plushie wears Barbaro’s No. 8 on a pink saddle cloth.\n\nIn 2007, Breyer Animal Creations released a Barbaro model that includes a Certificate of Authenticity from his owners, jockey, and main doctor at the New Bolton Center.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nIn just his fourth race, Big Brown was the 2–1 favorite in the Derby. He started from the far outside post position 20, but neither that, nor his lack of experience seemed to be a problem. At the break, Desormeaux did not push Big Brown, concentrating instead on getting good position on the first turn while settling instead behind the leaders. “He was just galloping, floppy-eared, off the bridle, cruising,” said Desormeaux. On the far turn, Desormeaux urged the horse and Big Brown responded with a burst of speed that swept him to the lead. He won by 4+3⁄4 lengths over filly Eight Belles, who was euthanized after breaking both front fetlocks during the post-race cool-down. The last horse to win the Kentucky Derby from post position 20 was Clyde Van Dusen in 1929.\n\nHe stands stud in retirement.\n\nThe bay gelding is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby. His odds were 50-1.\n\nFollowing overnight rain, the Churchill Downs natural dirt track was rated as “sloppy“. Ridden by Calvin Borel, Mine That Bird had trouble out of the starting gate and was left about eight lengths behind the rest of the field. By the time the pack of horses was running down the backstretch, Mine That Bird was so far back that NBC’s announcer Tom Durkin at first missed seeing him.\n\nCalvin Borel, using the ground-saving, rail-skimming riding technique that won him the 2007 Derby with Street Sense, charged past horses along the backstretch and at the turn for home moved into contention. Borel kept Mine That Bird on the rail, leaving it to go around just one tiring horse before ducking back onto the rail, where he exploded past Pioneer of the Nile and Musket Man so fast on the inside that Durkin, who was focused on the other two horses, did not see “Bird” come through until he was already three lengths in the lead. Mine That Bird pulled away to win by 63⁄4 lengths for the longest margin of victory in over 60 years.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nSuper Saver completed 1 1/4 miles on a sloppy track in 2:04.45. It had rained almost the entire day, but, appropriately, the sun came out just as the horses came on the track for the post parade, when the band struck up “My Old Kentucky Home.”\n\nSuper Saver hugged the rail the whole way while racing in the first flight of horses behind the runaway leaders, Conveyance and Sidney’s Candy. On the far turn, Super Saver came around Conveyance and knifed between him and Noble’s Promise, who had briefly taken the lead. Super Saver kicked clear passing the furlong pole while racing along the inside. He won in the field of 20 horses.\n\nSuper Saver retired to stand stud and has travelled to Australia, Argentina, and Turkey.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nOn the morning of the Kentucky Derby, his morning-line odds were 30:1. By post time, he was 21:1 in his first race on dirt. Animal Kingdom drew post 16 and was ridden to a 2+3⁄4 length victory in the Derby by jockey John R. Velazquez, who was originally scheduled to ride the early favorite and American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Uncle Mo. Uncle Mo was scratched due to a gastrointestinal illness on the Friday before the race, and Velazquez (who was discovered by his agent Angel Cordero) replaced injured rider Robby Albarado on Animal Kingdom. This was the first time Velazquez rode Animal Kingdom, and the jockey’s first Kentucky Derby win in 13 tries.\n\nAnimal Kingdom is retired and stands at Stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nI’ll Have Another started at odds of 15–1 in what was considered an unusually strong field. I’ll Have Another produced a strong finish to catch the front-running Bodemeister in the closing stages and win by one and a half lengths. He is the first horse in the history of the Derby to have won from post position 19. It was the Derby debut for his 25-year-old jockey Mario Gutierrez, who had not previously ridden in any of the Triple Crown races. After the race, Gutierrez described I’ll Have Another as “an amazing horse”, and said that “from the first time I met him, I knew he was the one”.\n\nIn the Preakness Stakes I’ll Have Another was sent off at odds of 3–1 with Bodemeister starting favorite at 8–5. Gutierrez settled the colt in fourth place as Bodemeister set the pace from Creative Cause. On the turn into the straight, I’ll Have Another passed Creative Cause to move into second place and caught Bodemeister in the final strides to win by a neck.\n\nA tendon injury ended his hopes of a Triple Crown.\n\nHe retired to stud in Japan, then moved to a breeding barn in California, the ultimately was donated to Old Friends Equine in Kentucky.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nOrb, ridden by Joel Rosario, started as the favorite for the 139th Kentucky Derby. Rosario positioned the colt toward the rear of the 19-horse field in the early stages as the outsider Palace Malice set a fast pace. From half distance, Orb began to make progress on the outside and turned into the straight just behind the leaders. Normandy Invasion took the lead from Palace Malice, but Orb continued to make ground in the center of the sloppy track. The favorite took the lead 1/16 of a mile from home and pulled away to win by 2 1/2 lengths from Golden Soul. McGaughey, who had just won the race for the first time, said, “I’ve always dreamed of this day and it finally came… I’m thrilled for the people who put in so much time on this horse, and of course I’m thrilled for me.“\n\nSince winning the Kentucky Derby in 2013, Orb has been referenced in several episodes of the Maximum Fun podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me. Orb, as part of a running gag, is described as a literal orb, an alien construction masquerading as a horse in order to breed with “Earth horse-women”.\n\nHe retired to stand stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion with a white blaze is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nHe was flown in from California, his first time on a plane, and traveled quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation.\n\nIn the race, California Chrome had a clean start and could have taken the lead, but Espinoza kept him behind two speed horses and only moved him to the front at the final turn when other horses began to tire. In the homestretch, he opened up a lead of five lengths before Espinoza eased him the last 70 yards of the race, narrowing his winning margin to 1+3⁄4 lengths. Sherman later explained that Espinoza slowing the colt down at the finish was “saving something for the next one”, a reference to the Preakness Stakes to come two weeks later.\n\nHe retired to stand stud and has a following of “Chromies” who love his Cinderella Story.\n\nThe bay stallion with a faint star on his forehead is best known for being the 12th Triple Crown winner in history.\n\nAmerican Pharoah started as the 2.9–1 favorite in an eighteen-runner field The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate.\n\nEspinoza positioned the colt in third place early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside.\n\nHe was retired to stand stud and had multiple owners and travelled extensively.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nFor the Kentucky Derby, Nyquist drew post position 13 in a full field of 20. Going off as the 2–1 favorite, Nyquist broke well and sprinted to the lead to establish position close to the rail. Gutierrez then eased back on the colt while Danzing Candy rushed up on the outside to set a very fast pace. Gun Runner tracked in third and then moved to the lead when Danzing Candy started to tire around the far turn. Nyquist responded and drew away from the field at the head of the stretch, then withstood a sustained drive by Exaggerator to win by 1+1⁄4 lengths.\n\nNyquist retired to stand stud. He had colic surgery in 2016 and recovered well.\n\nThe dark bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe Derby was held on a track that was officially labelled as wet fast. After drawing post position five in a full field of 20 horses, Always Dreaming broke well and settled just behind the early leader State of Honor with good position on the rail. After half a mile, jockey John R. Velazquez moved him to the outside of State of Honor and the two raced together into the far turn. When other horses then started to challenge for the lead, Always Dreaming quickly responded by drawing away and opening a lead of several lengths in the stretch. Longshot Lookin At Lee made a late run to finish second, but Always Dreaming was never threatened, winning by 2+3⁄4 lengths. After the race, Velazquez said, “I got a good position with him early and then he relaxed. When we hit the quarter pole, I asked him and he responded. He did it himself from there.“\n\nHe retired as a four year old to stand stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion with a large white blaze is best known for winning the Triple Crown.\n\nThe Derby was held on a rainy day at Churchill Downs. Although the surface had been sealed earlier in the day to minimize the effect of the rain on the footing, the track condition was still labeled as sloppy. Justify broke well and used his early speed to establish good position near the rail going into the first turn, running a length behind Promises Fulfilled. These two maintained their position for the first three-quarters of a mile. Going into the final turn, Promises Fulfilled dropped back while first Bolt d’Oro and then Good Magic were put to a drive. Justify responded to the challenge and opened up a lead of 1+1⁄2 lengths at the top of the stretch, widening to 2+1⁄2 lengths at the finish line.\n\nJustify came out of the race almost untouched by the mud due to his front-running style. The day after however, he appeared to be somewhat lame in his left hind leg, the sensitivity was later determined to have been caused by a heel bruise. To protect the heel, Justify was shod with a three-quarter horseshoe before he resumed galloping on May 10.\n\nAfter winning the Triple Crown, Justify was retired due an injury in his left front leg. He now stands stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn the Derby, Maximum Security crossed the finish line first, but was judged to have impeded War of Will and Long Range Toddy when he swerved into their path, causing them to check strides. As a result, Maximum Security was disqualified, and Country House, who had crossed the finish line second, was declared the winner.\n\nOn May 7, Country House was ruled out of running in the 2019 Preakness Stakes, due to his trainer detecting a virus. This marked the first time the Kentucky Derby winner did not race in the Preakness Stakes since 1996.\n\nCountry House went on to develop a series of ailments that led to his retirement. Accordingly, he was first “diagnosed with proximal suspensory ligament desmitis on both front fetlocks” in June. Country House then experienced complications, leading to his hospitalization at Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital on July 1 for an infection on his lower right fore. Because the right fore was not load bearing during his recovery from the infection, his left fore had to bear the extra weight and developed laminitis. Over the next several months, the laminitis was stabilized and Country House was then turned out to pasture.\n\nHe would never race again was is now standing at stud.\n\nThe bay stallion with a white blaze is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAuthentic, ridden by Velazquez drew the outside post, saddle cloth 18, making the start critical because he would either have to run hard to get early position or run further than most other horses because he was on the outside. Authentic started slow, whereas Tiz the Law got off to a perfect start and went into his usual stalker position. Velazquez urged Authentic to the lead, running a fast first quarter while being carried four wide around the first turn. Then Velazquez slowed the pace. Tiz the Law began to make his move on the far turn. The two horses ran head-to-head into the top of the stretch and Tiz the Law looked to have the advantage. However, Authentic responded to the challenge and drew off to win by 1+1⁄4 lengths.\n\nVelazquez said he had not been concerned about the pre-race talk regarding Authentic’s lack of stamina, noting instead how the colt had responded when asked to run at the head of the stretch. “That’s all you ask for a horse, that when you get after him and they give you everything they can, and he did. I mean, he responded. Every time I asked him for more, he gave more.”\n\nAfter the race, when Authentic was in the winner’s circle, he started to wheel about, apparently distracted by the ribbons on the winner’s blanket of roses. He knocked over a couple of people including his trainer Baffert.\n\nAuthentic retired to stand stud.\n\nThe bay stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby. The horse is named for a mandaloun, “a type of mullioned (or decorative partition) window from traditional Lebanese architecture”\n\nMandaloun started well and was fourth. He slowly moved up and challenged the leader, Medina Spirit. Behind him, Hot Rod Charlie and his stablemate Essential Quality began to move up. There were four horses in the stretch. Medina Spirit won by +1⁄2 length, Mandaloun was second with +1⁄2 length, third was Hot Rod Charlie with a head to stablemate Essential Quality. 5th placed O Besos was 4+1⁄2 lengths behind them.\n\nAfter the Kentucky Derby, an investigation was launched because of doping issues with Medina Spirit, who died on December 6, 2021; there was also an investigation of his trainer, Bob Baffert. On February 21, 2022, upon the disqualification of Medina Spirit, Mandaloun was awarded first place in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn 2022, Mandaloun was retired from racing and would stand stud.\n\nThe chestnut stallion with a white blaze and two white socks on his hind legs is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nRich Strike was short of the points required to qualify for the race. However, the last-minute scratch of another horse, Ethereal Road, allowed him to draw into the Derby, and minutes later, Reed took another phone call from chief steward Barbara Borden, asking him if he wanted to run Rich Strike in the Derby. Reed joked that the last-minute notification left him needing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as he had just been about to enter Rich Strike in another race. “He’s never been better; he loves this track,” said Reed. “All week long, I was like, ‘He just gets better every day.’ He’s so happy right now. It’s just a blessing to be able to run.”\n\nThe field for the Derby was one of the deepest in recent memory. Rich Strike was overlooked at odds of 80:1. He broke well from the outside post position and settled into the back of the pack where he was in eighteenth place after the first half-mile, 17 lengths behind the leaders. During this time Summer is Tomorrow and Crown Pride battled up front starting the race off with an extremely fast pace. He started his move on the final turn while weaving through traffic, first shifting out four horses wide of the rail then back towards the rail. In the stretch, he was checked briefly by a tiring horse but again found racing room and launched a sustained drive to the inside of Epicenter. He drew clear in the final strides to win by three-quarters of a length. A shocked Reed collapsed in the paddock.\n\nIt was the first graded stakes win for jockey Sonny Leon, who was commended by Reed for an excellent ride. “You know we had a difficult post but I know the horse,” said Leon. “I didn’t know if he could win but I had a good feeling with him. I had to wait until the stretch and that’s what I did. I waited and then the rail opened up. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited. Nobody knows my horse like I know my horse.”\n\nThe chestnut stallion is best known for winning the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMage broke slowly in the Derby as he did in his previous two close losing efforts. Jockey Javier Castellano allowed his mount to settle toward the back of the field of 18. A fast pace proved to his benefit, with fractions of :22.35, :45.73, and 1:10.11 set by frontrunners Verifying, Kingsbarns, and Reincarnate. Castellano picked his opportunities to advance and had Mage up to sixth by the mile marker. Down the lane, the lightly raced colt caught leader Two Phil’s to win by a length\n\nAt post-time, Mage went off at 15–1 to win. He joins Regret (1915), Big Brown (2008), and Justify (2018) as the only Derby winners who had only three prior starts. Mage, Justify, and Apollo (1882) are the only horses to win the Derby without having raced as two-year-olds.\n\nHe is still racing as a four year old."
