        "text": "What Exactly To Do Next? Try A Rear View Mirror.\n\nWhat: CTS Cape Premier Yearling Sale\n\nWhen: 20 – 21 January 2018\n\nWhere: Cape Town Convention Centre\n\nPlenty has been said and written about what 2018 has in store on the dramatically changing face of the South African horseracing landscape.\n\nA watershed year was 2017. Come to think about it, so was every year before that. One thing we can’t change is history. Love it or leave it, we are all entitled to an opinion and the reality is that life goes on.\n\nBut the indisputable facts are there for all to see. Over 130 stakes winners from just six renewals of the Cape Premier Yearling Sale suggest that this really is one sale that stacks the odds in favour of finding a serious racehorse, that could change your life forever.\n\nDon’t they just make us all sound so clever.\n\nNobody really knows who created the three types of lies axiom – you know the one – ‘lies, damn lies, and statistics’. But how do we argue the Cape Premier Yearling Sale stats, patterns and history when they are patently consistent and verifiable? With difficulty! The cold numbers already tell us that there are 27 Gr1 winners and counting from the six Cape Premier Yearling Sales to date.\n\nThe class of 2016 has already produced 6 stakes winners – even though these runners are still just 3yo’s with bright futures ahead of them.\n\nThe 2012 CPYS produced 38 stakes winners so far, including sire prospect Red Ray, Normanz, Athina, Gulf Storm, Whistle Stop, Graduation Day and Lanner Falcon.\n\nThe high quality 2013 sale has produced 23 stakes winners to date, including sire prospect Act Of War, Brutal Force, Pine Princess and Real Princess. In 2014, stakes winners like Liege, Banner Hill and Jo’s Bond passed through the ring.\n\nCloth Of Cloud, Lady Of The House, Singapore Sling and Smiling Blue Eyes are just four of 22 stakes winners from the 2015 renewal, while Friday’s Gr2 Sceptre Stakes runaway sensation Magical Wonderland and Gr1 winner Sand And Sea are among the early stakes successes from CPYS 2016.\n\nOverall, a formidable 85,9% of all lots catalogued since 2012 have made it to the racetrack, while 61,7% of all lots catalogued have won at least one race.\n\nThis weekend’s book is a terrifically balanced catalogue too with 70 lots by South Africa’s top four sires Captain Al, Dynasty, Silvano and Trippi and 18 lots by international sires, including the worldbeating Frankel and Camelot. There are eight lots produced from Gr1 winning mares and 14 siblings to Gr1 winners. That’s quality! Read on and make up your own mind – the future’s brighter than you may think!\n\nAre You Up For It?\n\nCape Thoroughbred Sales have instituted an Inward Buyer Incentive to reward international investment, which includes subsidies for travellers outside South Africa, both for established and new buyers. For more information contact Kerry Jack on (+27) 82 782 7297 or [email protected]\n\nClever Buyers Come Prepared!\n\nClick below to check out our list of the power of combo’s.\n\nBut most importantly, don’t miss our FREE Buyer’s Guide is an amazing, detailed summary of dam and siblings of sale prospects. It gives insight to what to expect of individuals in terms of class, stamina, sale price. No serious buyer should be without it. Click below to uncover the hidden truths….\n\nCAMELOT\n\nOne of four English Derby winners sired by Montjeu (the other three having all sired Gr1 winners), this four time Gr1 winner (a direct descendant of the legendary Kincsem) made a bright start with his first 2yos last season including French Gr2 winner Fighting Irish and group performers King of Camelot and Wait Forever\n\nLot 25 – this filly is out of a half-sister to Derby runner Cavaleiro and is from the same family as Breeders’ Cup Mile winner and sire Val Royal\n\nLot 68 – this filly is out of a half-sister to Gr2 Gimcrack winner Blaine, with her other notable relatives including champion sprinter and Breeders’ Cup winner Lit De Justice\n\nLot 69 – closely inbred to Sadler’s Wells (as is champion Enable), this filly is out of a Fastnet Rock half-sister to a Gr2 2yo, and is from the family of Sadler’s Wells’ Irish classic winning siblings Barathea and Gossamer\n\nLot 128 – this colt’s second dam is a full-sister to unbeaten 2000 Guineas winner and sire of over 50 stakes winners Footstepsinthesand, himself a half-brother to Gr1 winning 2yo Pedro The Great, one of the leading first crop sires in France in 2017\n\nCAPETOWN NOIR\n\nA son of champion sire Western Winter (sire of leading first crop sire What A Winter), he is a triple Gr1 winning Equus Champion and was produced by Equus Broodmare Of The Year Akinfeet, a daughter of multiple champion sire/broodmare sire Fort Wood\n\nLot 97 – this colt is a half-brother to 8 winners, including Gr1 SA Classic hero Love Struck\n\nLot 125 – this colt is a half-brother to 3 winners, including Gr3 winner Royal Pleasure, who, like the colt on sale is by a Gone West line sire, the family of Solo Traveller, Purple Diamond and Flying Ice.\n\nPick Of The Bunch from the 2015 Breeders Handbook CAPETOWN NOIR\n\nA R1m yearling in 2011, Capetown Noir won 8 races from 1200m to 2000m, notably Gr1 Cape Guineas and Gr1 Cape Derby as a 3yo, and Gr1 Queen’s Plate at 4. He was voted Equus Champion Miler at 3. Rated MR 116. Capetown Noir started his stud career at Summerhill, his 2015 fee R20.000.\n\nBreeders Handbook considers Capetown Noir’s significant female line ancestor to be the mare Spits, who is closely kinbred. Her main elements are descendants of the mare Agnes Court (Polly Agnes). Spits was mated to Noble Chieftain, a descendant of the Agnes Court female line, resulting in Martha, the 5th dam of Capetown Noir. Martha’s daughter Donna Anna was mated to Jungle Cove, whose female line has the same remote ancestry (Fam 16), resulting in Jungle Janna. The latter got Guineas winner Dance Every Dance from a mating to Northern Guest, whose significant female line ancestry brought more of Fam 16. Another Western Winter’s son Winter Solstice, Horse of the Year, is from Fam 16 female line. His 5th dam Brandy Ball and Capetown Noir’s 5th dam Martha are very close kin.\n\nBreeders Handbook suggests that suitable lines for Capetown Noir could include multiples of Fam 16 female line carriers, remote or otherwise.\n\nThere are two Capetown Noir yearling colts on offer, and both strike a chord.\n\n#97 half brother to Gr1 SA Classic winner Love Struck and to stakes winner Fakazi; their stakes placed five-time winning dam Particular Passion is by Rambo Dancer out of a mare by Prontisimo – the latter is a son of Liloy, who is half brother to Fair Arabella, the dam of Rambo

He won the G1 Travers S. and ran second in the G1 Breeder’s Cup Classic. He was the second highest rated 3yo in USA, with Timeform 127. At stud he sired G1 Kentucky Derby winner and US Champion 3yo colt I’ll Have Another in his second crop, as well as champion filly My Wandy’s Girl (subsequently sold as broodmare prospect for $700.000).\n\nFlower Alley, a son of US Champion Sire and sire-of-sires Distorted Humor, started his South African studcareer at Wilgerbosdrift. His 2015 fee was R80.000 (with a published ‘book full’).\n\nBreeders Handbook makes the observation that the dam of Flower Alley, Princess Olivia, is by Lycius whose dam is a daughter of Lyphard. Flower Alley’s fourth dam is a daughter of Goofed, the dam of Lyphard. This gives Princess Olivia a 4×4 double of Goofed, and a possible source of breeding excellence. She is dam of stakes winners in Japan, rated TFR 120/123, who are by Deep Impact, whose dam Wind In Her Hair is a daughter of Alzao, by Lyphard. The pedigree of Wind In Her Hair makes her very close kin to Lyphard’s son Elliodor, whose dam is full sister to Busted, the damsire of Wind In Her Hair. Deep Impact is from the same female line as Right Approach, who has several daughters out of Elliodor mares. The grandam of Distorted Humor, Sweetest Chant, is very close kin to Bold Reason and Never Bend. A large proportion of Distorted Humor’s G1 winners have Sadler’s Wells (as sire of dam, grandam, or damsire). Sadler’s Wells’ line of Bold Reason appears significant in his best offspring. Lalun, the dam of Bold Reason and Never Bend, is a noted La Troienne carrier, and La Troienne is invariably present in multiples in Distorted Humor’s best offspring. This apparent affinity for La Troienne (in Flower Alley present through Sadler’s Wells’ damsire Bold Reason) is emphasised in I’ll Have Another whose dam has a double of Bold Reason’s half brother Never Bend and whose damsire Pleasant Tap is from the La Troienne female line. The close resemblance of performance at stud of Distorted Humor and Trippi makes the latter’s daughters interesting options for Flower Alley. There are six yearlings on offer, several with notable pedigrees.\n\n#29 filly out of stakes winning Giant’s Causeway mare, whose third dam Rahika Rose is by Unfuwain whose dam is close kin to Deep Impact; the dam of Rahika Rose is by Wassl, a son of Mill Reef (Never Bend) (Maine Chance)\n\n#121 filly out of Gr1 placed Gr2 winner Red Dor, who is by Elliodor; the mare has produced five winners

rated Timeform 120p.

He was sent to South Africa later that year, where the problem persisted. The female line focus, according to Breeders Handbook, is on 5th dam Agar’s Plough (Irish Oaks, TFR 122) and 4th dam Mesopotamia (Champion Irish 2yo, TFR 126). Both are closely kinbred, both carry elements making them close kin to notable others.

Undefeated in South Africa, he was voted Equus Champion 3yo Colt. Timeform rated him 124 in 2015, the year a sesamoidal ligament injury ended his racing career in Dubai. He remains Silvano’s highest rated son. Vercingetorix started his stud career at Maine Chance, his 2015 fee R40.000.\n\nAs possibly significant pedigree elements, Breeders Handbook pinpoints lines which kin-link to Vercingetorix’ 3rd dam Scarteen (by Sweet Song) and 4th dam Noble Vixen (by Royal Pardon). This loosely translates as Lady Juror-clan elements. A second possible angle highlighted is the one of Buckpasser-links. There are nine yearlings on offer, with three apparent Breeders Handbook highlights.\n\n#84 filly out of stakes winning Captain Al mare Ocean’s Swift, her second foal; Captain A has highclass Captain

three to five. His wins included the Gr1 SA Derby and Gr1 Champion’s Challenge. He was first past the post in the Gr1 Vodacom July, only to be placed second following an objection. He rated MR 119. Wylie Hall started his stud career at Cheveley Stud, his 2015 fee set at R20.000.\n\nBreeders Handbook suggests that suitable lines for Wylie Hall could include kin-links to the kin-breeding from his sire Redoute’s Choice. This leads to Buckpasser (notably Northern Guest, National Assembly, Lassie Dear), Nijinsky (notably Dancing Champ), Danehill (Caesour, Requiem). Given Wylie Hall’s Australian female line, elements from Marauding combined with the female line could be interesting, leading to Jallad and more generally multiple Hyperion (notably Flower Bowl), Alycidon, Aureole, Donatello. Danzig might count, in the context of National Assembly, Maroof. There are six yearlings on offer. Three of them catch the eye given Breeders Handbook’s views.\n\n#55 colt, out of an Al Mufti mare whose Gr1 winning dam Imperious Sue (voted Equus champion older female) is by Northern Guest (same female line as Redoute’s Choice), giving a Buckpasser double. (Normandy)\n\n#108 colt, whose dam Princess Aura is a winning Fort Wood mare with a strong Hyperion background.

The mare is by a son of Danehill (giving 3×3 Danehill with Wylie Hall, and thus providing double Buckpasser), while her grandam has lines of Nijinsky, Sir Ivor and bottom female-line ancestor Manila. Compare this to Redoute’s Choice, who has Nijinsky, Sir Ivor and Bletchingly (three-parts brother to the mare Manila). (Normandy)\n\n(find all the stallion’s detail on the Sporting Post website – https://www.sportingpost.co.za/sire/wylie-hall/ )\n\nForeign Sires Musings\n\nThree Frankels and a Scat Daddy – with such fare there’s likely to be solid interest from abroad at the sale.\n\nThere are eighteen ‘foreign’ yearlings in all, sired by stallions standing in Europe, Australia and Argentina.
