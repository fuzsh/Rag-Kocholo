        "text": "Winning the coveted “Triple Crown” of horse racing consists of finishing first in all three of the sport’s most prestigious events in the same year; the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.\n\nTriple Crown winners are considered the most dominant horses of all-time. You’ve probably heard most of their names at one time or another. If you ask someone to name the top race horse in history, you’re likely to hear names like Secretariat or Seattle Slew – both Triple Crown winners.\n\nWhat about the horses that do not quite make the cut? Below we explore those unfortunate equines who managed to win only two of the three Triple Crown races, narrowly missing having their names added to the history books among past great champions.\n\nIt is important to remember that prior to the 1930s, the “Triple Crown” as it is known now did not really exist. The Kentucky Derby had yet to gain much notoriety up to that point and many owners simply chose to not enter their best horses there. With that said, we have still included a comprehensive list of two-event winners.\n\nHorse Racing’s Triple Crown Close Calls\n\nWinners of Both the Kentucky Derby & Preakness Stakes\n\nThe most harrowing combination has to be winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, but failing to win the Belmont Stakes. This is the most heart-breaking because these races are now always run in the same order – Kentucky Derby, Preakness, then Belmont.\n\nThat being said, the Preakness was ran before the Derby eleven times prior to 1931, and the Belmont ran eleven times before the Preakness. Both 1923 and 1931 happened to be two of the years the Preakness ran before the Derby, so there were not quite the same stakes for Zev and Twenty Grand than the other horses on this list.\n\n23 horses in all have won these two legs of the Triple Crown and, amazingly, eight of those horses finished in second place at the Belmont, coming just one spot short of history.\n\nYear Horse Belmont Finish 2014 California Chrome 4th 2012 I’ll Have Another Scratched 2008 Big Brown Did Not Finish 2004 Smarty Jones 2nd 2003 Funny Cide 3rd 2002 War Emblem 8th 1999 Charismatic 3rd 1998 Real Quiet 2nd 1997 Silver Charm 2nd 1989 Sunday Silence 2nd 1987 Alysheba 4th 1981 Pleasant Colony 3rd 1979 Spectacular Bid 3rd 1971 Canonero II 4th 1969 Majestic Prince 2nd 1968 Forward Pass 2nd 1966 Kauai King 4th 1964 Northern Dancer 3rd 1961 Carry Back 7th 1958 Tim Tam 2nd 1944 Pensive 2nd 1936 Bold Venture Scratched 1932 Burgoo King Did Not Enter\n\nHorses to Win Only the Preakness & Belmont Stakes\n\nA total of 18 horses have won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Out of that number, seven horses did not even participate in the Kentucky Derby due to a conflict with the Preakness, or simply not wishing to run the race.\n\nThat leaves 11 horses on this list that tried and failed to win the Triple Crown. Four of those remaining participants managed to finish in second place in the Kentucky Derby before going on to win the next two legs.\n\nYear Horse Derby Finish 2005 Afleet Alex 3rd 2001 Point Given 5th 1994 Tabasco Cat 6th 1991 Hansel 10th 1988 Risen Star 3rd 1974 Little Current 5th 1967 Damascus 3rd 1955 Nashua 2nd 1953 Native Dancer 2nd 1949 Capot 2nd 1940 Bimelech 2nd 1922 Pillory Did Not Enter 1920 Man o’ War Did Not Enter 1895 Belmar Did Not Enter 1881 Saunterer Did Not Enter 1880 Grenada Did Not Enter 1878 Duke of Magenta Did Not Enter 1877 Cloverbrook Did Not Enter\n\nList of Horses to Win the Kentucky Derby & Belmont Stakes\n\nJust 11 horses have won only the first and last leg of the Triple Crown, making it more rare than actual Triple Crown wins. Four horses from this group very narrowly missed the crown by finishing 2nd at the Preakness in addition to Derby and Belmont wins.\n\nYear Horse Preakness Finish 1995 Thunder Gulch 3rd 1984 Swale 7th 1976 Bold Forbes 3rd 1972 Riva Ridge 4th 1963 Chateaugay 2nd 1956 Needles 2nd 1950 Middleground 2nd 1942 Shut Out 5th 1939 Johnstown 5th 1931 Twenty Grand 2nd 1923 Zev 12th\n\nComplete List of Triple Crown Winners\n\nFor good measure, here is the full list of 12 horses that managed to complete the Triple Crown by winning all three races."
