        "text": "One of the last two commercial sons of the great sire Danzig (by Northern Dancer) still at stud, along with War Front, Hard Spun had a cracking weekend at Woodbine in Ontario.\n\nOn Oct. 14, two daughters of the Darley stallion won graded stakes at Woodbine. The 6-year-old Spun Glass won the Grade 3 Ontario Fashion Stakes, with another daughter of Hard Spun, the stakes-winning 4-year-old Loyalty, in third place. On the same card, the 5-year-old Millie Girl won the G3 Ontario Matron.\n\nEach of those three is bred on the most popular mating pattern of the past few decades: Northern Dancer crossed with Mr. Prospector.\n\nHard Spun provides the Northern Dancer, and his successful daughters are out of mares by Elusive Quality (Loyalty), Songandaprayer (Spun Glass), and Smart Strike (Millie Girl). In addition, Elysian Field (Hard Spun), winner of the Woodbine Oaks in July, also was produced by a daughter of Smart Strike.\n\nOf course, Hard Spun himself is bred on the related cross of Northern Dancer with Mr. Prospector’s sire Raise a Native through that stallion’s great son Alydar and his champion son Turkoman. The latter is the broodmare sire of Hard Spun, and Turkoman is responsible for much of the physical type of Hard Spun.\n\nThe stallion is not the most typical son of Danzig, whose most common good performers were strongly made, lengthy and well-muscled horses, and frequently not especially tall. Although quick and quite talented, Hard Spun took the height and scope and bone of Turkoman; as might be expected, this son of Danzig frequently presents a mix of physical types among his foals.\n\nBut they have a common trait: many of them are quite effective athletes.\n\nFrom 13 crops of foals of racing age, Hard Spun has 1,948 foals in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and 1,046 winners who have earned nearly $150 million. Among them are 100 stakes winners at present, and these include such as champion Questing (G1 Alabama Stakes, Coaching Club American Oaks); Silver State (G1 Metropolitan Handicap), Aloha West (G1 Breeders’ Cup Sprint), Spun to Run (G1 Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile), and the current-year stakes winner Two Phil’s. The latter won a trio of G3 stakes, including the Ohio Derby, but is best-known for his effort in the 2023 Kentucky Derby, staying within striking distance of the leaders, taking the lead off the turn, and then battling through the stretch and holding second against winner Mage (Good Magic).\n\nThe latter quartet above are all young horses at stud. Two Phil’s enters stud for 2024 at WinStar at a fee of $12,500. Top sprinter Aloha West entered stud at Mill Ridge for the 2023 season and covered a full book at a fee of $10,000. Silver State entered stud at Claiborne in 2022. His first foals will be yearlings in 2024, and he will have a stud fee of $15,000. Spun to Run entered stud at Gainesway in 2021, and his first crop of foals will be 2-year-olds of 2024. He will stand for a fee of $10,000 next year.\n\nSo Hard Spun will have a likeable group of sons competing for success at stud in the coming years, just as his daughters are acquiring a reputation as broodmares.\n\nAnd Hard Spun himself comes from a fine producing family. His stakes-winning dam Turkish Tryst also produced the stakes winner Our Rite of Spring (Stravinsky), who is the granddam of champion Improbable (City Zip). Hard Spun’s second dam is Darbyvail, a Roberto half-sister to champion and classic winner Little Current (Sea-Bird), and the third dam is Luiana (Our Babu).\n\nAlthough unraced, Luiana had a champion pedigree; two of her earlier siblings had been champions. Her half-sister Primonetta, from the first crop by Horse of the Year Swaps, was unbeaten and highly regarded at two, then was one of the top fillies of 1961, and she was named champion older filly in 1962.\n\nThe following season, Primonetta’s full brother, the two-years younger Chateaugay, won both the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes and was named champion 3-year-old colt of 1963.\n\nBoth of these champions were bred and raced by Darby Dan Farm, which had acquired their dam, Banquet Bell (Polynesian), for $9,000 as a yearling at the 1952 Keeneland summer sale. Primonetta was the mare’s second foal, Chateaugay her third, and Luiana was the fifth.\n\nA source of distinguished achievement, Banquet Bell produced champions for Darby Dan and continues as a fount of athleticism for breeders in America and abroad.\n\nThe stakes over the weekend produced winners who had repeated ties to Claiborne Farm, as the Grade 2 San Vicente winner was Lord Nelson, a chestnut son of farm sire Pulpit (by A.P. Indy) out of African Jade, a mare by leading sire and broodmare sire Seeking the Gold. Lord Nelson defeated last season’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner Texas Red by a neck in 1:22.15 for the seven furlongs of the San Vicente.\n\nIn Kentucky, the winner of one of Turfway’s preliminary stakes preps for the Spiral was the War Front colt The Great War, last seen finishing a respectable fourth in the G1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile behind Texas Red and Carpe Diem. Already the sire of 33 stakes winners and 8 G1 winners, War Front (Danzig) is currently the most popular stallion at Claiborne.\n\nThe Breeders’ Cup form is further evidence of the quality that The Great War possesses, and he blew away his opponents at Turfway with a 7 ¼-length victory, going 6 ½ furlongs in 1:18.69 on Polytrack.\n\nBred by Claiborne, The Great War races for international racing and breeding giant Coolmore, which purchased the colt for $1 million at the 2013 Keeneland September yearling sale. The bay son of War Front is out of Guide, a daughter of Pulpit. A full sister to stakes winner Laity, Guide won a maiden among her eight starts, and The Great War is her first stakes winner. Guide is out of stakes winner Tour, a daughter of Claiborne’s champion Forty Niner (Mr. Prospector), and two of her siblings produced the major winners Zensational (Unbridled’s Song) and Departing (War Front).\n\nAlso winner of the Blenheim Stakes in Ireland, The Great War has won four of his nine starts and is now trained by Wesley Ward after doing his earlier training and racing with Aiden O’Brien at Ballydoyle.\n\nAt the same 2013 Keeneland sale, Lord Nelson sold for $340,000 to John Fort and races for Peachtree Stable. The chestnut colt was an outstanding representative for Pulpit, an important stakes winner from the first crop of A.P. Indy who was one early indicator of that stallion’s importance as a sire of racehorses and breeding stock. Pulpit was a high-class racehorse with speed and versatility, and as a sire he had success from the start, with his most important son being the immensely popular Tapit, a fetching gray who stands at Gainesway.\n\nAs an individual, Pulpit was a tidy bay of medium size who won four of his six starts, including the G2 Fountain of Youth and the Blue Grass Stakes and was second in the Florida Derby. The Blue Grass was his prep for the 1997 Kentucky Derby, in which he finished fourth behind Silver Charm, Captain Bodgit, and Free House.\n\nAt stud, however, Pulpit put his contemporaries in the shade, siring 77 stakes winners so far, and that number will grow. Lord Nelson is from Pulpit’s next-to-last crop, and there are 26 more in the stallion’s last crop, now 2-year-olds.\n\nWhen Pulpit entered stud in 1998, he took up residence in the famed stallion barn at Claiborne like the great Mr. Prospector (Raise a Native), his important son Seeking the Gold, and Danzig (Northern Dancer), whose influence around the world is even greater than Mr. Prospector’s.\n\nSeeking the Gold was approximately midway in age between the old guard and Pulpit. A top-class racehorse, Seeking the Gold had finished second to Forty Niner in the Travers and to Alysheba in the Breeders’ Cup Classic. At stud, he proved himself an even better sire, getting champion fillies right away. That was just like Seeking the Gold’s broodmare sire Buckpasser, who also stood at Claiborne.\n\nSo Seeking the Gold was a hot young sire in 1998, and his international appeal accelerated rapidly over the next couple of years due to the exploits of his son Dubai Millennium. In 1999 and 2000, Dubai Millennium won nine of his 10 starts — including four G1s — and earned nearly $4.5 million.\n\nSire of 92 stakes winners (10 percent), Seeking the Gold’s fillies tended to fill up his stud record, but it also included top colts like Florida Derby winner Cape Town and Belmont Stakes winner Jazil, but none was better than Godolphin’s great performer Dubai Millennium. Of Seeking the Gold’s sons at stud, the most enduring has been Petionville, but the most influential once again was Dubai Millennium, who died after one season at stud. Dubai Millennium succeeded in getting a son, Dubawi, who has proven himself an outstanding sire in Europe.\n\nToday, Seeking the Gold is still in his old stall in Claiborne’s stallion barn. Age 30, the bay has been pensioned from breeding for several years, but his legacy and influence on the breed live on.\n\n* The preceding post was first published earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nHalf a lifetime ago, I spent the summer and fall of 1984 watching Danzig’s first crop of racers set their sire on the path of a legendary stallion career. Among that first crop was the year’s champion 2-year-old colt Chief’s Crown, who won four Grade 1 stakes that season, including the inaugural Breeders’ Cup Juvenile.\n\nThe overwhelming quality about Danzig’s stock was their consistency and their class. He had winner after winner at the most important tracks against well-meant young prospects, and plenty of them raised their game to earn black type.\n\nAs a result, Danzig became a premier sales sire over the subsequent two decades, with his offspring bringing large sums from the leading international buyers, such as the Maktoum family, Juddmonte Farm, the Niarchos family, and Coolmore. Due to these and other major breeders, the impact of the dark bay stallion with the crooked blaze has spread round the world.\n\nDanzig’s son Danehill was the best sire in Australasian racing and breeding, and Green Desert joined Danehill and others to balance the classic strains of Northern Dancer, such as Sadler’s Wells, with the expression of their own set of traits in European pedigrees.\n\nOverall, Danzig has been a powerful influence for speed, and the stallion’s stock have frequently been able to carry their speed at least a mile. On occasion, they also have won major races at classic distances. Danzig Connection won the Belmont Stakes at 12 furlongs, and Chief’s Crown was placed in all three of the 1985 classics: second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, third in the Belmont.\n\nComing near the end of Danzig’s stallion career, his son Hard Spun was an admirable racehorse who ran a smashing race to finish second in the 2007 Kentucky Derby behind Street Sense (by Street Cry) and in front of Curlin (Smart Strike), who was third. Curlin turned the tables by winning the Preakness narrowly from Street Sense, with Hard Spun third. At year’s end, Curlin claimed the first of his Horse of the Year titles by adding the Breeders’ Cup Classic to his season’s accomplishments. Hard Spun was second in that race and was no worse than the third-best colt of his crop.\n\nLike Street Sense and Any Given Saturday (Distorted Humor) from the same crop, Hard Spun was acquired for stud by Sheikh Maktoum’s Darley operation to stand in Kentucky at Jonabell. In addition to spreading the reach of Darley’s stallion program into Kentucky, Sheikh Maktoum was also working to gain access to Japan as a base for breeding and racing.\n\nAfter quite a lot of work and negotiation, he succeeded. As part of Darley Japan’s breeding program, they shipped Street Sense to Hokkaido to stand at the head of the stud in 2013. He returned to Kentucky for the 2014 season, and he was replaced by Hard Spun in Japan for a year.\n\nHard Spun will be standing at Jonabell in Kentucky for 2015, and his book will be well-filled by choice broodmares. The son of Danzig has had a very good year, with the 5-year-old Hard Not to Like winning the G1 Jenny Wiley at Keeneland in the spring and 3-year-old Wicked Strong taking home the prize in the G1 Wood Memorial. On Saturday, Hard Spun’s 4-year-old son Hardest Core added a further branch of laurel to his sire’s honors with victory in the G1 Arlington Million.\n\nThree G1 winners from three crops suggest that Hard Spun is a factor for soundness, good bone, and longevity on the track. Those seem to be qualities frequently found among the sire’s produce and that he possessed himself.\n\nHard Spun is a big, powerfully made animal. He stands a bit over 16.2 hands and even now gives the impression of being a leggy horse. In his own makeup, as well as in his offspring, Hard Spun can pass on quite a bit of his grandsire, 1986 champion older horse Turkoman (Alydar).\n\nThat is not a given, however, as Hard Spun’s offspring run from the elegant and refined to the big and rugged. Hardest Core is toward the latter end of the scale and shows plenty of the Turkoman influence. He was a big and progressive sort who attracted good interest at the sales but didn’t get sold immediately.\n\nBred by Mueller Farms in Kentucky, Hardest Core went through the yearling sales ring three times before finding a new owner. He was an RNA at $70,000 in the Keeneland January sale, then an RNA again for $60,000 at Keeneland September, before finally closing the deal for $87,000 at Fasig-Tipton’s October yearling sale. The colt was so big and strong by this time that his qualities attracted the winning bid from Adena Springs, which raced him through his 3-year-old season before selling him at the Keeneland November sale as a racing prospect.\n\nHardest Core showed no form as a young horse, got to the races at 3, when he won a maiden at Saratoga and an allowance at Belmont convincingly enough that Adena sold the colt for $210,000 to Gregory Bentley, and Hardest Core has proven to be worth every dime.\n\nHe is unbeaten this year at 4 in three starts, and the gelding has ascended the class ladder precipitously with an allowance victory, followed by a three-length success in the Henlopen Stakes at Delaware, and now a G1 at Arlington.\n\nHardest Core will not be carrying on the Danzig line, however, because he was gelded after purchase by the Bentley Stable, but he offers the promise of continuing sport on the course and appears to have the potential for further improvement.\n\n*The preceding post was first published earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nThe following post first appeared earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nWhen the dust settled after Saturday’s Grade 1 Coaching Club American Oaks, Godolphin’s English-bred filly Questing became the second G1 winner for second-crop sire Hard Spun (by Danzig) at the direct expense of her sire’s first G1 winner Zo Impressive, who won the Mother Goose last month and ran second in the nine-furlong CCA Oaks.\n\nOverall, this was quite a good weekend for Hard Spun, whose daughter Filare l’Oro took second place in the Virginia Oaks. The sire of 11 stakes winners to date, Hard Spun was second among first-crop sires last year, and he ranks second among his contemporaries this season, too.\n\nWinner of the G1 King’s Bishop at Saratoga, Hard Spun ran second in the 2007 Kentucky Derby behind juvenile champion Street Sense (Street Cry) and ahead of eventual divisional champion and Horse of the Year Curlin. In later encounters with his top contemporaries, Hard Spun was third to Curlin and Street Sense in the Preakness, second to Any Given Saturday in the Haskell, and second to Curlin in the Breeders’ Cup Classic. Clearly, Hard Spun was a highly competitive member of a high-class group of colts in 2007.\n\nThis was also the year that Darley dived into the deep end of the American stallion market and sent three of the colts above (Street Sense, Hard Spun, and Any Given Saturday) to stud at their Jonabell stallion operation in 2008, along with the year-older Discreet Cat.\n\nIt was almost an embarrassment of riches, and as my associate Bob Fierro at the biomechanics and pedigree analysis firm DataTrack International noted, “This was a very closely matched group of horses, both on the racetrack and in their projections as stallion prospects.”\n\nDataTrack takes the physical measurements of stallions and mares, runs the data through some computer models for analysis, and projects which are the most likely to produce successful offspring, both with one another and with the general population.\n\nThe star of the 2008 entering stallion crop on their raw numbers was Flashy Bull, but Fierro noted that “we rank our projections based on the quality and size of the stallions’ books, along with other factors, and with such a closely matched group, the ones with the early success had to be those who got the best mares, or the most compatible mares, and had their offspring placed in the right hands on the right surface.”\n\nQuesting rates as one of those who has traveled to find her best surface and form. Conceived in Kentucky and foaled in England, she raced there initially, running second in the Oh So Sharp and third in the Prestige Stakes, both G3s, when trained by John Gosden.\n\nImported to race in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies last season, where she finished a respectable but non-threatening fifth behind divisional champion My Miss Aurelia and G1 winner Grace Hall, Questing had not shown premium form in her two races on turf this season while trained by Kiaran McLaughlin. Switched to racing on dirt in her previous start, however, the bay filly out of the Seeking the Gold mare Chercheuse won a salty-looking allowance for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont on June 24 and came into the CCA Oaks with a flashy speed figure rating off that victory.\n\nNow Questing is a G1 winner, and along with her adversary Zo Impressive, they should give their sire a strong hand among fillies racing a mile or more the rest of the season.\n\nJust as Questing has emerged as a premium member of this year’s two-turn fillies, her sire Hard Spun has proven himself among the best of his contemporaries at stud. Currently ranked second behind second-crop sire leader Scat Daddy, who stands at Ashford for Coolmore, Hard Spun is joined in the top five by the Darley pair of Street Sense and Discreet Cat, and by the Lane’s End stallion English Channel.\n\nAirdrie’s Flashy Bull, the deceased stallions Lawyer Ron and Master Command, Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile winner Corinthian (Gainesway), and After Market (Lane’s End) fill out the top 10 leading second-crop sires.\n\nOf the top 3-year-old colts of 2007, Curlin raced on another year, added a second Eclipse Award as Horse of the Year and champion older horse, and has his first foals coming to the races this season.\n\nThe following post appeared earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nWith his powerful victory in the Grade 2 Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park, The Factor put the spotlight on himself in the run-up to the Kentucky Derby. The colt’s success is further gratification for trainer Bob Baffert and owners George Bolton and Fog City Stable.\n\nThe good-looking gray is also the second son of the Claiborne Farm stallion War Front who has won a major Kentucky Derby prep and is highly ranked by most Derby handicappers. (The other is G2 Fountain of Youth winner Soldat.)\n\nAnd all the people who have had a share in the breeding and development of The Factor also are basking in the reflected glory of the colt’s achievements.\n\nThe Factor was bred in Kentucky by H & W Thoroughbreds. Their sale of first the colt at the 2008 Keeneland November sale for $50,000 and then the dam in a private transaction was chronicled in an earlier column.\n\nBetween the November sale and the following year’s July sale of selected yearlings at Fasig-Tipton, the sales market slumped even further, and The Factor resold as a yearling for only $40,000 in 2009.\n\nThe buyer was show horse veteran Kim Valerio, acting for Mike Shustek. Valerio said, “Until last year, I bought only two to four yearlings a year. In 2009, I bought three, including The Factor.”\n\nPart of the reason she was drawn to the colt by the good but not famous Danzig stallion War Front was physique. Valerio said, “I come from a horse show background, where a lot of the best horses have Northern Dancer in them, and I love the Danzig line and the long, curvy look those horses get from Northern Dancer. At the time of the sale, his neck was longer in proportion to his body, but as he’s matured, his shoulder has filled in more.”\n\nAnother of the trio of yearlings that Valerio bought in 2009 is a Dynaformer colt named Wegner, who won a good maiden at Santa Anita earlier this year, then was unplaced to Anthony’s Cross and Tapizar in the G2 Robert B. Lewis Stakes in February.\n\nValerio said, “Both colts were purchased for a gentleman (Shustek) who puts up the money and then decides what to do with the horses. Typically, they are bought to race.”\n\nBut in this case, Shustek chose to retain Wegner and sell The Factor. The gray went through the ring at the 2010 Barretts May sale of 2-year-olds in training and brought $250,000.\n\nThe process from yearling sale to in-training auction was not a hurried one for The Factor, however. Valerio said, “After the July sale, he was turned out at Tom Van Meter’s farm outside Lexington in a field with a group of yearlings. They didn’t go to Florida till January, and Barry Eisaman broke both of them and put them into early training.”\n\nBoth the Dynaformer colt and his War Front companion progressed so well that “they never missed a beat, and we didn’t even breeze them until March. That’s what decided us on sending The Factor to the (May) Barretts sale.”\n\n“I loved that colt,” Valerio admitted. “He was the only colt I bid on at the July sale, and I wanted him to go into the right hands. So I kind of nagged Bob Baffert about buying him. We went to breakfast and he was asking, ‘Who is War Front?’ That guy is such a bluffer. Not two seconds after the hammer falls at the sale, he calls me and says, ‘I bought your horse! I bought your horse!’\n\n“And I told him ‘You’re such a bluffer. If I’d known you were on him, I’d have set the reserve higher,’” Valerio concluded.\n\nValerio has never regretted the sale because Baffert has gotten so much out of the colt. Now the winner of three consecutive races in fast time, The Factor would become the fourth Kentucky Derby horse that Valerio has been connected with in the last eight years.\n\nShe selected Magna Graduate, who was eligible on earnings for the Churchill Downs classic, but the colt’s connections opted not to rush their horse into the Derby. Valerio “selected Scat Daddy and privately bought Joininthedance,” who led the 2009 Kentucky Derby won by Mine That Bird.\n\nIf The Factor goes in the Derby, he is almost certain to lead part of the race. The exciting question is, “Which part?”\n\nThe following post appeared earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nA pair of Florida stallions took turns in the spotlight at Gulfstream Park this weekend. Pomeroy’s son Flashpoint won the Grade 2 Hutcheson Stakes impressively by 6 1/2 lengths from the Trippi colt Travelin Man. And the Trippi filly R Heat Lightning won the G2 Davona Dale Stakes by 7 1/4 lengths from the Tapit filly Dancinginherdreams, with the Pomeroy filly Pomeroys Pistol in third.\n\nTrippi’s son Gourmet Dinner was a good second in the G2 Fountain of Youth behind Soldat (a son of the Danzig stallion War Front, whose other son, The Factor, won the San Vicente last weekend at Santa Anita).\n\nPomeroy (by the Danzig stallion Boundary) has first-crop 3-year-olds this year, like War Front. They are part of a deep and successful group of young sires that also includes last year’s freshman sire leader Congrats (also formerly in Florida and now in Kentucky at Vinery) and Preakness winner and champion Bernardini. The latter was selected as the first mate for Horse of the Year Zenyatta and is the sire of Fountain of Youth third To Honor and Serve.\n\nAs a racehorse, Pomeroy was a sprinting fool, much like his sire Boundary, and the blaze-faced Pomeroy won the G1 Forego and King’s Bishop, as well as the G2 Alfred G. Vanderbilt at his beloved Saratoga.\n\nRetired to stud in Florida, the medium-sized and powerfully made Pomeroy has been popular with breeders and buyers.\n\nFrom his earliest returns at stud, however, he wasn’t the hottest sire on the block. As a powerful horse with tons of speed, breeders expected the stallion’s stock to race and win early and often. But the Pomeroys seemed to surprise everyone by acting like they wanted a little time, and some of them may also want a bit more distance than their sire did.\n\nPurely on pedigree, there was no reason for Pomeroy to prefer sprinting. His sire Boundary was by Danzig, who got more milers than pure sprinters, and was out of a Damascus mare, which would tend to give a mile or more. Then Pomeroy is out of a mare by Seeking the Gold, one of the best sons of Mr. Prospector for getting quality performers at a mile and up.\n\nBut then, if breeding worked by a set formula, we would not have half the fun. The sophistication required for breeding with consistent success and the variability of results obtained by breeders with great experience or little are reasons for great humility. But when a mating works, what greater elation is there?\n\nSurely among the most elated at present are the South African breeders who purchased Trippi in July 2008. Johann and Gaynor Rupert bought the handsome bay son of End Sweep to stand at their L’Ormarins Stud. The Ruperts purchased Trippi from a partnership that had stood the horse for his entire career at Ocala Stud in Ocala, Fla., and exported Trippi to the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe final Northern Hemisphere crop by Trippi are now 2-year-olds, and the stallion has been on fire. R Heat Lightning won the G1 Spinaway and ran second in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies last year, and Gourmet Dinner has been a model of consistency.\n\nPart of the reason for consistency in a sire’s production is the quality of his mares. Year after year, stallion managers have to work to maintain the quality of their stallions’ books, and the success of that is seen in the stallions’ progeny on the track.\n\nTrippi had made a name for himself as a leading stallion in Florida at the time of his sale, standing for $12,500, and Pomeroy was one of the most popular young sires in the state when he retired.\n\nAs he had done with Congrats, Brent Fernung brought Pomeroy to Florida, where the horse initially stood at Cloverleaf Farms, then moved to Vinery Florida after Cloverleaf closed its operations in Florida.\n\nAlthough Pomeroy was already doing well with his book this year, a Vinery representative confirmed that the stallion’s book doubled to more than 120 mares over the weekend.\n\nOne of the good mares that Fernung enlisted for Pomeroy’s first book was the stakes winner Two Punch Lil (by Two Punch). A big, ruggedly made gray mare, Two Punch Lil was already the dam of stakes winner Uncle Sam Lee and a stakes-placed runner when breeder Silverleaf Farms sent her to Pomeroy.\n\nThe resulting colt was Flashpoint, who was nice enough as a short yearling to fetch $115,000 at the Keeneland January sale in 2009. Just two months earlier, his dam had gone through the Keeneland November sale, barren to Pomeroy. She brought $1,200. For her new owners, the mare has a yearling filly by Congaree.\n\nThe following post was published earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nFew farms have an international reputation equal to that of Calumet Farm, now owned by the de Kwiatkowski family, and the historic Thoroughbred nursery with the picturesque white fences just outside Lexington added another Grade 1 winner on Sunday when the Quiet American filly Switch won the La Brea Stakes on the opening-day card at Santa Anita.\n\nCalumet bred and raised the bay daughter of Quiet American from their homebred stakes winner Antoinette, who is one of four stakes winners by their homebred stakes winner Nicholas (by Danzig). Antoinette’s form peaked at 4, when she won six of nine starts, including the G3 Athenia Handicap, and she earned $399,160 in two seasons of racing.\n\nAntoinette is the dam of two stakes winners to date, Keystone Gulch (by Gulch) and Switch (click here for pedigree), who was already a winner at G2 level and had run second in the G1 Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Sprint, Lady’s Secret (to Zenyatta), and third in the G1 Las Virgenes.\n\nThe farm’s good producer is among the lots consigned by Calumet to the upcoming Keeneland January sale (held Jan. 10-14). The 16-year-old Antoinette is in foal to Roman Ruler, last year’s leading freshman sire, on a Feb. 16 cover.\n\nCalumet Farm manager Bill Witman said, “We operate the farm as a commercial enterprise, and all horses reach a point where they attain maximum value. This might be the time with Antoinette.”\n\nIn addition, Calumet has two daughters of Antoinette. The older of these is Art Affair, an unraced daughter of Mineshaft. The 5-year-old has produced a good filly by Quiet American and is “being booked to Midnight Lute,” twice the winner of the Breeders’ Cup Sprint and by Quiet American’s best son, Real Quiet.\n\nThere is a practical reason for the repeated use of Quiet American with this family. The breeder is working to add size and scope to the foals, and as a result, Calumet has repeatedly mated Antoinette to good-sized, rangy types. Their best result has been with Quiet American, one of the last remaining sons of leading sire Fappiano. But keeping to the same Mr. Prospector male line and the same rugged type, the mare also has had three colts by Lemon Drop Kid, including the eight-time winner Jano (earnings of 101,400 Euros or $140,864).\n\nThat colt’s full brother, Louison, went through the Keeneland September yearling sale for $150,000 the year before Switch. In 2008, Switch sold for the same price at the Keeneland yearling sale and races for CRK Stable.\n\nWitman said, “She was never a really big filly, but then most of this family are not.” As a yearling, Switch was nicely balanced and showed composure during her time at the sale. She has matured and strengthened to rank among the best of her age and sex.\n\nWitman attributes the filly’s progress and consistent form to trainer John Sadler, whom he said has “done a masterful job” to keep Switch racing well at the G1 level all year.\n\nToughness and consistency are hallmarks of the progeny of Quiet American, who stands for Darley at Jonabell. In addition to classic winner Real Quiet and G1 winner Switch, the 24-year-old stallion has sired 52 stakes winners (7% of foals), along with an outstanding proportion of runners (82%) and winners (57%) to foals.\n\nAntoinette has done equally well with her offspring, with four winners from six foals of racing age and two stakes winners. The mare’s weanling is a filly by Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Pleasantly Perfect, and this was another mating with the goal of adding size and substance to the offspring.\n\nThe result is a “really nice weanling,” Witman said, that combines the strength of the dam with the scope of the sire. Whether sold as a yearling or retained, the half-sister to Switch will be yet another promising prospect for Calumet as the operation moves into the next decade of the 21st century.\n\nThis story was published earlier this week at Paulick Report.\n\nMore than the weather is heating things up. Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta both showed their form in victory over the weekend, Quality Road reinforced the evidence that he is the best older colt in America with his Metropolitan Handicap a fortnight ago, and now Blame has won his seventh race from 10 starts with a game effort in the Grade I Stephen Foster at Churchill Downs on Saturday.\n\nThis is a spectacular older division, loaded with talent and drama of the sort that most sports would kill to have for their headlines.\n\nBlame is the late-comer to this party, but the 4-year-old son of Arch and the Seeking the Gold mare Liable indicated that he might rise to heights like this with his development through the second half of 2009. (Click here for Blame’s pedigree.)\n\nBred and raced by Adele Dilschneider and Claiborne Farm, Blame is the partners’ biggest single success from a project that Claiborne entered into nearly 15 years ago.\n\nAt the Keeneland July select yearling sale in 1996, Claiborne president Seth Hancock set himself a serious task: to find a yearling colt with the physical qualities and pedigree that could make a good stallion … after he succeeded on the racetrack.\n\nAs Hancock himself admitted at the time, it was a tall order, but the program at Claiborne was built around breeding, buying, and standing stallions. So Hancock went out and got the best prospect he could find, and other yearling selectors wish they had done so well.\n\nFor $710,000, Hancock bought the first foal out of the very fast Danzig mare Aurora, herself the third foal out of champion juvenile filly Althea (by Alydar), who was one of eight stakes winners from the great broodmare Courtly Dee (by Never Bend).\n\nFor depth of family, Arch was outstanding, and this is a family Helen Alexander has cultivated at Middlebrook Farm and that has proven a gold mine of talented and highly marketable individuals.\n\nWhen Aurora proved more limited for stamina than her top-class dam, winning only a single listed stakes, Alexander sent the young mare to the very promising Roberto horse Kris S., who had been moved to Kentucky to stand at what was then called Prestonwood Farm (now WinStar), following the successes of the stallion’s early crops in Florida.\n\nKris S. was impressing breeders with the size and scope of his stock, as well as the blessed combination of speed and stamina that the best of them possessed. Among his early offspring, Prized (Turf) and Hollywood Wildcat (Distaff) won Breeders’ Cup events, and among the later offspring, Kris S. got leading turf mare Soaring Softly, Santa Anita Handicap winner Rock Hard Ten, and English Derby winner Kris Kin.\n\nSo the mating added stamina and turf potential to a very fast young mare who raced successfully on dirt and probably needed a bit more physical hardiness.\n\nBoth at the yearling sale and during his racing career, Arch appeared to get the best from both of his parents, having enough speed to win his debut at 2, then winning four of his subsequent six starts at 3, including the G1 Super Derby at 10 furlongs.\n\nSent to stud at Claiborne, Arch has withstood the slings and arrows of commercial fortune and has emerged as one of the sires breeders can depend upon for strength and scope and bone.\n\nOverall, Arch has managed to overcome preconceptions about the aptitudes for his offspring and become a respected sire who produces a solid percentage of high-class racers.\n\nOne of the first to reach the top was, of all things, an English-trained sprinter named Les Arcs. A winner twice at the Group 1 level, Les Arcs showed his best form in winning the July Cup. He was a top turf sprinter with an excellent turn of foot.\n\nLes Arcs was unusual for Arch’s stock because the stallion does not get many sprinters. Instead, most of his offspring show plenty of improvement with age and distance.\n\nArravale and Pine Island – both foals of 2003 – proved that Arch could sire top-tier performers in America, too. Arravale won the Grade 1 E.P. Taylor and Del Mar Oaks, and Pine Island won the Grade 1 Alabama and Gazelle.\n\nAs a sire, Arch has proven more versatile than many breeders would have expected. Instead of channeling the turf talents and late maturity so common among this line of sires from Hail to Reason and Roberto to Kris S., Arch has responded well when mated with lines that have speed and class, such as Liable, a daughter of the Mr. Prospector stallion Seeking the Gold from the great Claiborne family descending from Rough Shod.\n\nArch has built upon this rich genetic legacy, and with nine crops of racing age, the stallion has sired 26 stakes winners and 27 stakes-placed racers, a hair more than 10 percent of his offspring. Those are the statistics of a useful sire, but he is a really good sire when mated to the right lines and types of mares."
