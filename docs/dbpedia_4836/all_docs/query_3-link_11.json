        "text": "American Pharoah\n\nracehorse\n\nAmerican Pharoah, (foaled 2012), American racehorse (Thoroughbred) who in 2015 became the 12th winner of the American Triple Crown—by winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes—an accomplishment that ended a 37-year drought since Affirmed captured that honour in 1978.\n\nBreeding and early years\n\nAmerican Pharoah was foaled on February 2, 2012, at Stockplace Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. He was sired by Pioneerof the Nile, who finished second in the 2009 Kentucky Derby. His dam was Littleprincessemma, a lightly raced mare who was sired by Yankee Gentleman. Her pedigree included such champions as Northern Dancer and Secretariat.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Horse Racing Quiz\n\nWhen he was a yearling, American Pharoah was sent to the Fasig-Tipton Selected Yearling Sales auction in Saratoga Springs, New York. When he failed to receive any bids higher than the minimum sale price of $300,000, owner Ahmed Zayat of Zayat Stables decided to keep the colt himself. Encouraged by the positive observations of handlers who noticed the colt’s long stride, athleticism, and catlike movements that gave him a type of “swagger,” Zayat hired famed trainer Bob Baffert to mold him into a racehorse. American Pharoah’s notably misspelled name was chosen as the winning entry in Zayat Stables’ annual naming contest and submitted to the Jockey Club before the error in pharaoh was detected.\n\nAmerican Pharoah made his racing debut on August 9, 2014, in Del Mar, California, where he ran poorly and finished an unimpressive fifth. Undaunted, Baffert sent him out again on September 3 to compete in the seven-furlong Del Mar Futurity. To better prepare the colt, several adjustments were made, such as removing his blinkers, placing cotton in his ears to ease his sensitivity to noise, and providing a new jockey, Victor Espinoza. Those changes proved to be a winning combination, as American Pharoah went to an early lead and galloped to victory, winning by 4 3/4 lengths. The colt also took early command of his next race, the FrontRunner Stakes at Santa Anita, California, edging out Calculator for a 3 1/4-length win. Despite being scratched from the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile because of a deep foot bruise, American Pharoah won the 2014 Eclipse Award for Champion Two-Year-Old Male.\n\nAmerican Pharoah continued his dominance as a three-year-old at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Despite stumbling a bit out of the gate when one of his shoes came loose, the colt recovered quickly and romped to an easy 6 1/4-length victory on a sloppy track. Buoyed by his success, Baffert had no reservations about entering the colt in the prestigious $1 million Arkansas Derby. Rather than go to the lead quickly, however, American Pharoah tracked just off the pace and cruised down the homestretch to win by eight lengths, ensuring him a starting position in the Kentucky Derby.\n\n2015 Triple Crown\n\nAmerican Pharoah entered the Kentucky Derby as the 5–2 favourite before a record crowd of 170,513. Although he wore No. 18, the colt started from the No. 17 post position, a spot from which no horse had ever won the Kentucky Derby. In the 20-horse field, American Pharoah broke well and cruised at a leisurely pace in third place down the backstretch. As the field entered the homestretch, Espinoza swung his colt to the outside and battled Firing Line to the finish, defeating him by a length and handing Baffert his first Derby win since 2002.\n\nWeather conditions proved challenging for the Preakness Stakes, which was beset by violent rainstorms that drenched the track before and during the race. Along with those unfavourable conditions, American Pharoah drew the difficult No. 1 post position along the rail—from which only two winners since 1960 had started—in a small, eight-horse field. After an awkward break from the post, Espinoza urged American Pharoah to the front of the pack immediately. The colt overpowered the competition, gliding over the sloppy track with ease, and won by seven lengths.\n\nAn electrified crowd of 90,000 fans filled Belmont Park on June 6 to see American Pharoah attempt to make horse-racing history. In a field of eight, he was sent off as the 3–5 favourite from the No. 5 post position. When the gates flew open, the colt broke late, hesitating for just a moment before catapulting into the lead. American Pharoah dominated the race, staying ahead of the field and pulling away in the homestretch to win the Belmont Stakes by 5 1/2 lengths with a time of 2:26.65, the sixth fastest in Belmont history.\n\nFinal racing years\n\nAfter a two-month hiatus from racing, American Pharoah was entered in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey, on August 2, which drew a record crowd of 60,983. He demonstrated his supremacy once again, with an easy victory of 2 1/4 lengths over six rivals who struggled to keep up with him. After completing his eighth straight win, American Pharoah finally met his match on August 29 in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Springs, New York. Known as the “Graveyard of Champions” because of its notorious reputation for defeating iconic horses such as Affirmed, Gallant Fox, and Secretariat, the race claimed American Pharoah as its latest victim. Although he coasted comfortably down the backstretch in first place, he was challenged down the homestretch by Keen Ice, who engaged him in a fierce battle to the wire and defeated him by 3/4 of a length. On October 31 American Pharoah appeared in his final race, the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic at Keeneland Racetrack in Lexington, Kentucky. He went off as the sentimental 3–5 favourite before a crowd of 50,155 that stood 20-deep along the rail to cheer the colt on to victory. In a triumphant farewell, American Pharoah thundered out of the gate and dispatched his rivals by 6 1/2 lengths in a record-shattering time of 2:00.07 to become the first Triple Crown champion to also win the Breeders’ Cup.\n\nAmerican Pharoah won 9 out of 11 starts and set a single-season earnings record of nearly $8.3 million. He was unanimously named 2015 Horse of the Year and won the 2015 Eclipse Award for Champion Three-Year-Old Male. He was retired to Coolmore America’s Ashford Stud farm in Versailles, Kentucky.\n\nBarbara A. Schreiber"
