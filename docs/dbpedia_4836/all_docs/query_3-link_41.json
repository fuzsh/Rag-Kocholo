        "text": "VIEW DESCENT CHART\n\nThis family was known as and referred to as \"The Agnes Family\" long before Bruce Low published his work, Breeding Horses by the Figure Systemin 1895, introducing the system adopted world-wide to track the foundation mares of the thoroughbred. It had had some good runners in Tibthorpe (1864), Brown Bread (1862) and finally an Oaks winner, Bonnie Jean in 1880, and a (tied) Derby winner, St. Gatien in 1884. But it was the brilliance of English Triple Crown winner, Ormonde, and his near relatives that re-focused attention on the \"Agnes\" mares, all descended from Agnes, an 1844 filly by Clarion, who did little on the turf, but founded a powerful dynasty of female descendants.\n\nThe earliest mare to whom the family can be traced is a sister to the racehorse Stripling, who won a plate at Bishop Aukland in 1751. The identity of their dam was not recorded, and has been a tantalizing mystery for turf historians, particularly since Stripling and his sister appear to have been bred at the important and well-known Marske Stud of the Hutton family in Yorkshire, many generations of whom bred thoroughbreds. C.M. Prior (Early Records of the Thoroughbred Horse; London: Sportsman Office, 1924) believed the family \"probably\" originated \"...from one or other of the Darcy mares, and is not a distinct family, as the Huttons and Darcys were close neighbors, and on terms of intimacy...\" In 1726 James D'Arcy's (the younger, later Lord D'Arcy of Navan) daughter, Elizabeth, married John Hutton III, breeder of Marske, the sire of Eclipse; they were in, fact, distant cousins due to an earlier marriage of Hutton's great-grandfather with Lord Darcy of Hornby's daughter, Barbara.\n\nIn 1979 Cedric Borgnis (British Racehorse, June, 1979) attempted to apply an \"inductive\" approach in determining the identity of Stripling's dam, concluding the evidence, based on an analysis of breeding patterns he claims the Hutton family used, showed Family 16 to be a branch of Family 8 (and thence, according to Borgnis, to Family 4). Unfortunately, the D'Arcy records of their influential Sedbury stud have never surfaced, and in 1968 Borgnis was assured by Ernest Hutton, a Hutton descendant and authority on sporting pictures, that the Hutton records had \"moldered away in out-buildings at Marske.\"\n\nThe first entry for this family in the General Stud Book is for a mare by Young Marske, bred by John Hutton, who produced nine foals recorded therein. Her dam was by Brother to Silvio, a bay horse by Cade from Mab, a mare by Hobgoblin (a grandson of the Darley Arabian) bred by the Huttons. Silvio (1754) and his brother (17--) were both bred at Marske; Silvio was a good race horse, and Mab won 100 guineas in a race at Hambleton in 1747. The bay Young Marske (1771), by the Hutton-bred Marske, was purchased after his racing career from the Duke of Grafton, and stood at the Hutton stud.\n\nThe Young Marske mare's grandam was the elusive sister to Stripling, probably born in the late 1740s or early 1750s; all that is known is that her brother was running in 1751, and that they were by Hutton's Spot (1728), who was bred at Marske. Hutton's Spot was a grey horse by Hartley's Blind Horse, out of a mare by Surley; Surley (1708), also grey, by Hutton's Grey Barb, also was bred at Marske.\n\nThe family descends to the present through a daughter of the Young Marske mare, Farewell, a bay filly born in 1792, by Slope, a moderately popular stallion in the 1790s. Farewell ran in the north; in 1797 she was beaten in a race at Newcastle by Diamond, the latter later going on to beat the famous Hambletonian."
