        "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY.\n\nTHERE has been talk about other horses, talk about how racing luck or the right jockey or tactical brilliance could decide the outcome of next Saturday's Kentucky Derby.\n\nBut as Jimmy Conway, a trainer who knows what it's like to saddle a Derby winner, observed last week: “Let's face it, it's a race between Affirmed and Alydar.\n\nConway, the man who won the 1963 Derby with Chateaugay, clapped his hands together, quick and hard. “Those two are like that,” he said. They must adjust to possible speed, like Sensitive Prince. But other than “They must adjust to possible speed, like Sensitive Piince. But other than that, they must race each other. They'll have to look each other in the eye somewhere along the line, and that could be your Derby.”\n\n“I'm glad htye haven't met yet this year,” said John Veitch, trainer of Alydar. “It makes the Derby all the more exciting.”\n\n“Yes,” agreed Laz Barrera, trainer of Affirmed, “it's a confrontation. Affirmed needs a horse like Alydar to make him run.”\n\nIf race horses are the nonviolent weapons used by the rich to wage vicarious combat, then Harbor View Farm's Affirmed and Calumet Farm's Alydar are the ultimate weapons, about to be detonated at Churchill Downs in the 104th running of America's favorite horse race. Seldom ‘have two 3-year-old thoroughbreds with such awesome credentials faced each other in the opener of racing's annual Triple Crown series.\n\nAnd seldom has a Derby scenario offered such glamoir and intrigue.. If a Hollywood scriptwriter tried to sell the story, he would probably be told to stop drinking.\n\nConsider, for example, the main plot: the inherited wealth of Mrs. Gene Markey, 85-year-old owner of Calumet Farm in Lexington, Ky., against the wealth of 65-year-old Louis Wolfson, the controversial, proxybattling retired self‐made financier who didn't come into racing until 1959 when he started buying land in Ocala, Fla., for Harbor.View Farm. By that time, seven horses carrying the devil's red and blue silks of Calumet Farm had won the Derby, and two of those, Whirlaway. in 1941 and Citation in 1948, had gone on to sweep the. Triple Crown. .\n\nBut the Calumet dynaSty, founded by Mrs. Ma'rkey's first husband. Warren Wright, the baking‐powder magnate,. collapsed when the sons of Bull Lea,. the famous Calumet foundation sire, failed to carry on the quality line.\n\nFrom 1941 through 1961. with Ben Jones training most of the horses, Calumet led the national money-winning list 13 times. But in 1976. Calumet horses won only $83,000. The renaissance, though, was already under way. Sweet Tooth, a Calumet mare descended from Bull Lea, had .foaled Our Mims, last year's champion ‘3-year-old . filly, and Alydar,.Who„was only a _year‐. ling when young Jahn. Veitch took over as Calumet trainerin 1976.\n\nIronically, it was Affirmed's grandsire, Raise-A-Native; a horse owned, raced and‐then syndicated by Wolfson, who sired !Alydar for the rival Calumet. Raise ANative, bought by Wolfson for\n\n$39,000 at won font- straight races as a 2-year-old before a lee injury ended :his. competitive. career: He was syndicated for $2.6 million .and became\n\nbreeding stallion ,at Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Wolfson now owns only tvn Share in the syndicate. the same number as Calumet.\n\nThen there's Mrs. Louis Wolfson, the former Patrice Jacobs, 41, whose late • father, Hirsch Jacobs,..was one of racing's best‐loved and Most successful trainers.\n\nOn the other side of the main‐plot fence, Mrs. Markey will be getting support from her husband of 26 years, 83-year-old Admiral Gene Markey, an engaging sportsman whose previous wives included the actresses Hedy Lamar, Joan Bennett and Myrna Loy and whose 11 novels include one called “Woinen Women. Everywhere.”\n\nIf that's not a rich enough plot, add 18-year-old Steve Cauthen as the jockey for Affirmed—the same Kentucky‐. bred .Steve Cauthen who last year became racing's first Sik Million Dollar Boy by riding mounts whose purse earnings exceeded $6 million._ Along the ‐way to acclaim as athletg of .the year, Cauthen broke. Jorge Velasquez's New York record for number of winners. And who will be` riding Alydar in the mile.-and-a-quarter DerbY? Jorge Velasquez.\n\n•\n\nThough he was conceived in Kentucky, Affirmed was foaled in Florida. Thus, as a Florida‐bred horse. he is something of a resented “al'en” in the bluegrass cotmtry. But his jockey, young Cauthen, comes from Walton, KY., not far from Lexington. That poses a conflict for Kentuckians who cherish Alydar as a hometown boy from Calumet Farm but who arc also proud of homegrown Cauthen.\n\n• As the bourbon begins to flow this week and Derby fever rises, cases will be made for several other legitimate contenders.\n\nOne can't, ‐for example, overlook an undefeated colt like Sensitive Prince, especially when his trainer happens be Allen Jerkens, the only man to ‘saddle two horses that beat Secretariat. And don't forget Believe It, back in top form now and trained by Woody Stephens, the canny, 64-year-old Hall of Fame horseman who won the 100th. Derby with Cannonade; Eve.Esops Foibles, the winner‐, of both the Louisiana and Arkansas Derby, is being tabbed. as a possible sleeper..\n\nYet none of those, contenders will. be better than third ‘choice when the parimutuel windows open. The heaviest support-- will -go- for-7Aly-dar: and` Af firmed; the coppery halfqon chestnut obits’ who so far. have proved be’ the best .among the 29,159 thoroughbreds foaled in North America during 1975.\n\nAs 2-year-olds fast season, they met six times. Affirmed, a son of Exclusive Native (and grandson of..RaiScl‐A Native,.Alydar's sire), won fOur of those encounters. But almost every race was a head-to-head battle decided in several cases by the. photofinish camera. it weren't for Alydar, Affirmed would he going into the Derby with a perfect 13-for-13 record. If it weren't for Affirmed, Alyc!ar would now have record of 12 firsts in 14 starts.\n\nEach colt has won all four of his Starts so far this year, alWays as an odds‐on favorite returning a profit of less than even money. Though both raced almost exclusively in New•York last season, neither has been there this year. Alydar followed the Florida route used by so many previous Derby winners, taking three races there and then winning the Blue Grass Stakes last Thursday at Keeneland, in Lexington, by 13% lengths. Affirmed comes to the Derby off four California victories at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park: He has earned $700,127, a record for a horse going into the “Run for the Roses.”\n\n“I know my horse,” says Barrera, 52, who won the 1976 Derby with Bold Forbes and has been voted an Eclipse award as America's leading trainer the last two years. “He's better than last year. People make rumors. They say he ran slow the last part of his Califor nia races, but that's because he needs a horse like Alydar to make him run. Nobody has made him run except- Alydar.”\n\nSays Veitch, Alydar's . 32-year-old trainer: “My horse is stronger than last year, more mature. He knows how to relax, and he's been finishing very strong. He couldn't be better.”\n\n•\n\nFor Veitch and Cauthen, who turns IS today, this will be the first of what undoubtedly will be many Derbies. For the 3-year-old horses, of course, it will be the first, last and only Derby.\n\nThe odds against a’ horse's ever getting to the Derby, much less winning it, are astronomical. Of the more than 50,000 thoroughbreds that go to the post each year •at American tracks, only about one in ‘eight earn the annual $10,000 to $15,000 it takes to meet expenses. Only about 2 percent ever win a stakes race.\n\nHope and, in many cases, vanity prompted owners to nominate a record total of 319 horses for this year's Derby. The ,group consisted of 290 colts, 25 geldings and four fillies.\n\nAfter three years of “store bought” Derby winners, this one figures to produce a victory for the homebred side, _horses .bred by their owners. The last three Derby winners, Foolish Pleasure, Bold Forbes and Seattle Slew, all .were purchased at public auction for bargain prices of under $22,000.\n\nFour of this year's top contenders, the only exception being Believe It, were conceived in the same breeding shed at the Spendthrift Farm establishment of Leslie and Brownell Combs, where 35 fashionable stallions stand. Alydar, Affirmed and Sensitive Prince, a son of Majestic Prince, all have Raise A Native in their family tree, either as sire or grandsire. He. in turn, is a son of Native Dancer, the Alfred G. Vanderbilt colt whose narrow loss in the 1953 Kentucky Derby was his only defeat in a 22‐race career.\n\n•\n\nSo the scene is set for the next chapter in the Derby script. Among the romanticists, sentiment seems to be building for the Markeys.\n\n“It's a sport with her,” says Admiral Markey, a cigar in his hand and a glass of brandy on the table beside him. “Nothing commercial. She's always been like that about horse racing.”\n\n“That's very kind, dear,” says. Mrs. Markey. “I hate pushers with a poisonivy passion.”\n\n- ‘Have you ever had a poison‐ivy salad with roquefort, dear?” the Admiral asks his wife. “It's delightful.”\n\n‘They are sitting in red‐leather easy chairs in the sunny living room of their white‐column house at. Calumet Farm, ‘where they will watch the Derby on television.\n\nThe Markeys, their mobility sharply curtailed by arthritis, can stand up to greet their guests, they get around most. iy in Wheelchairs. However, they remain mentally alert and cheerful. ."
