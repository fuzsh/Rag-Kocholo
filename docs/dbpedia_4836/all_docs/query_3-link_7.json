        "text": "Breeding and early years\n\nAffirmed was foaled on February 21, 1975, at the Harbor View Farm, a 438-acre (180-hectare) spread in Ocala, Florida. His sire was Exclusive Native. His dam was Won’t Tell You, a daughter of Crafty Admiral. Both grandsires were champions. On the maternal side of Affirmed’s lineage, Crafty Admiral earned $499,200 in four years of racing. On the paternal side, Affirmed’s grandsire, Raise a Native, was undefeated in four races before becoming injured and having to retire.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Horse Racing Quiz\n\nAffirmed’s career would forever be linked to Alydar, against whom he would battle throughout his racing life. Affirmed’s first race was on May 24, 1977, at Belmont Park in New York, an easy win that he followed with a victory in the Youthful Stakes on June 15. Alydar was also entered in the Youthful Stakes, his first time on a track, and he finished fifth. In their next meeting, on July 6 in the Great American Stakes at Belmont Park, Alydar made a rush from behind to catch and beat Affirmed by three and a half lengths.\n\nAffirmed and Alydar met for the third time in the Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga, New York, in August 1977. They went off at even money and galvanized spectators with a head-to-head struggle in the stretch. Alydar made his typical stretch run on the outside, but he never got by Affirmed, who held on to win by half a length. The two colts continued to rouse racing fans in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 15. That time Alydar caught Affirmed at the 1/16 pole and won, going away by one and a quarter lengths.\n\nTheir final meeting of 1977 was in the Laurel Futurity at the Laurel Race Course in Maryland. Only four horses started, with the juvenile title on the line. As expected, it became a two-horse affair, which Affirmed won by a neck. During the year, Affirmed had won four of six meetings with Alydar—seven of nine races overall—and was named Best Two-Year-Old Colt. Their next encounter would be in the 1978 Kentucky Derby.\n\nTriple Crown: 1978\n\nThe 104th running of the Kentucky Derby drew a crowd of about 131,000 to watch an 11-horse field in which Alydar was the 6–5 favourite. Affirmed, ridden by jockey Steve Cauthen, took the lead at the second turn of the Churchill Downs track and was never passed. Alydar, meanwhile, appeared to have trouble holding the track and dropped off the pack, falling 17 lengths behind before staging a remarkable finishing drive that left him one and a half lengths behind Affirmed at the finish.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The two golden chestnut colts dueled in the backstretch, and Alydar was only a head behind at the top of the stretch. What followed was a furious charge to the finish line, with Alydar on the outside and Affirmed on the inside. There was a long wait for the formal announcement of the winner after the stewards studied the photos of the finish, and, when it came, the result was Affirmed by a neck. The winner’s purse was $136,200, which pushed Affirmed’s total bankroll to $1,023,227. Although 20 other horses had earned $1 million or more by that time, none had accomplished it so early in their racing careers.\n\nA crowd of more than 65,417 people showed up at Belmont Park on June 10 for the running of the Belmont Stakes, where only five horses paraded to the starting gate. Affirmed rushed for the lead at the very outset but was caught by Alydar in the backstretch. After that the two ran together with the lead never more than the tip of Affirmed’s nose. Affirmed managed to push his head across the finish line first, in what was possibly the fiercest struggle ever seen on a racetrack, to become America’s 11th Triple Crown champion. It was the ninth meeting of the two horses and their fifth photo finish together. Alydar, with his loss in the Belmont, became the first horse to finish second in all three Triple Crown races.\n\nThe two horses met once more in Saratoga’s Travers Stakes on August 19 that year. Although Affirmed led Alydar across the finish line, he was disqualified for interference, and Alydar was declared the winner. Despite the victory, Alydar still had not passed his nemesis at the wire that year.\n\nAffirmed ran in three other races before the end of the year, winning one, and was named Horse of the Year. In the following year, he had nine starts, won seven of them, and was named Horse of the Year for the second consecutive time."
