        "text": "In becoming America’s ninth Triple Crown winner—and the first since the post-World War II proliferation of mass media in the U.S.—Secretariat entered into a rarefied celebrity status and came under unprecedented attention during each of his subsequent races. For example, when he was entered in the $125,000 Arlington Invitational (at Arlington Park, near Chicago), Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley issued a 200-word proclamation declaring it Secretariat Day, and the colt’s first visit to the Midwest produced a sellout crowd of 41,223. To nobody’s surprise, Secretariat won easily by nine lengths.\n\nIn his following race, the unthinkable happened: Secretariat placed second at the prestigious Whitney Handicap in New York on August 4. His defeat was compared to the losses by Man o’ War to Upset in the 1919 and Gallant Fox’s to the 100–1 shot Jim Dandy in 1930.\n\nSoon after the start of the Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap in New York on September 15, Secretariat settled into fifth place on the outside. Onion took the lead, and Riva Ridge stayed with him. Going into the far turn, Riva Ridge made his move, as did Secretariat. The stablemates ran head-to-head in a match race until Secretariat pulled away, winning by three and a half lengths in a new world record time for a dirt track of 1:452/5. The win made Secretariat the 13th millionaire Thoroughbred in horse racing history.\n\nTwo weeks later Secretariat threw his fans into a panic once again when at the 11/2-mile Woodward Stakes in New York he came in second to a four-year-old who was winning only his seventh race in 32 starts. But Secretariat followed up the loss with another win, at the $100,000 Man o’ War Stakes on October 8, 1973, at Belmont Park.\n\nThe time was fast approaching for Secretariat to retire, and his syndicate owners were waiting patiently for his stud career to begin. As the owners well knew, as long as he raced, there was always the possibility of injury. The Canadian International Championship Stakes on October 28, 1973, was chosen for his last outing. Held at the Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, the race was about 200 miles from Kenilworth Park, where Man o’ War, the other great horse of the 20th century, ran his last race. Race day at Woodbine was cold, windy, and enshrouded in drizzle, but the 35,117 fans who turned out were well rewarded, as Secretariat stormed home with ease after having opened a 12-length lead. This final race was good for $92,775, bringing his total earnings to $1,316,808 and making him the fourth leading money winner at that point in racing history. His third year was the richest single season for a horse to that point, with nine wins in 12 races and $860,404 in purses.\n\nSoon after he was retired to stud in November 1973, he was named Horse of the Year, becoming the 10th Thoroughbred of the century to win successive Horse of the Year awards. Secretariat was inducted into the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame in 1974 and died in 1989."
