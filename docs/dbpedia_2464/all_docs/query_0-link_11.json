It is situated a few miles south-west of Chester-le-Street, near the villages of Craghead and Sacriston.\n\nCoal mining once provided the village's main source of employment, but the last mines in the area had closed by the mid-1980s.\n\nEdmondsley has one primary school and a post office. There was also a public house, the Fleece, but this closed in 2007."
