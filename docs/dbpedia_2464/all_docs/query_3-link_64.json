        "text": "THE SECOND TIME AROUND—IS HARDER . . .\n\nDecades after the last footprints were left on the Moon, the U.S. was preparing to return to the Lunar surface in a new class of rockets, when the mission suddenly became much more urgent. It would have to be a rescue mission.\n\nUnbeknownst to the rest of the world China had sent its own Lunar expedition. A manned expedition. Until a distress call was received, no human outside of China even knew that the mission was manned—or that their ship had crash-landed and couldn’t take off again.\n\nTime was running out, and if the four Chinese astronauts were to be rescued, the American lunar mission would have to launch immediately, with only a skeleton crew. Once the heroic U.S. astronauts were underway the army of engineers and scientists back home had the daunting task of deciding what equipment could be left on the Moon to permit the Lunar lander vehicle vehicle to lift safely from the Moon with the two U.S. astronauts and the four stranded Chinese taikonauts! Could the U.S. mount such a mission successfully—and would thousands of years of instilled honor “allow” the Chinese astronauts to accept a rescue?\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\nTravis S. Taylor—“Doc” Taylor to his friends—has earned his soubriquet the hard way: He has a doctorate in optical science and engineering, a master's degree in physics, a master's degree in aerospace engineering, a master's degree in astronomy, and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Dr. Taylor has worked on various programs for the Department of Defense and NASA for the past sixteen years. He's currently working on several advanced propulsion concepts, very large space telescopes, space-based beamed energy systems, and next generation space launch concepts. He has appeared in several episodes of the History Channel’s Universe series. He lives in Auburn, AL with his wife Karen and their daughter.\n\nLes Johnson is a NASA physicist, manager, author, husband and father. By day, he serves as the Deputy Manager for the Advanced Concepts Office at the NASA George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the coolest jobs in the universe. In the early 2000s, he was NASA’s Manager for Interstellar Propulsion Research and later managed the In-Space Propulsion Technology Project. He was technical consultant for the movie Lost in Space and has appeared on the Discovery Channel series, “Physics of the Impossible” in the “How to Build a Starship” episode. He has also appeared in three episodes of the Science Channel series, Exodus Earth. In his spare time he writes popular science books and articles, including Solar Sails: A Novel approach to Interplanetary Travel, Living Off the Land in Space: Green Roads to the Cosmos and Paradise Regained: The Regreening of Earth.\n\nListen to the authors discuss the book here on the Baen Free Radio Hour.\n\nA KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOR IN A SAVAGE GALAXY\n\nCaptain Dominic Flandry has been knighted for his many services to the Terran Empire—an Empire which is old, jaded, and corrupt, as Flandry well knows—but he also knows that the Empire is better than anything that is likely to take its place. And while that “Sir” before his name may be an added attraction to comely ladies (not that he has ever lacked for the pleasant company of the same), he expects that it will also bring him less welcome attention from envious “colleagues” within the empire.\n\nWhat it is not likely to do is make him more of an object of interest to the alien Merseians, whose plots against the Empire he has repeatedly foiled. They already are as aware as they can be of how much simpler their plans to rule the galaxy would be if their most dangerous adversary were the late Sir Dominic Flandry.\n\nThis is the sixth volume in the first complete edition of Poul Anderson’s Technic Civilization saga.\n\nPraise for Poul Anderson:\n\n“These are stories of the classic science fiction tradition: hard science and tough characters in logically well integrated action stories.” —Jerry Pournelle\n\n“One of science fiction’s authentic geniuses.” —Chicago Sun-Times\n\n“The winner of seven Hugos and three Nebulas . . . one of the towering figures of modern SF and fantasy.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“Anderson fuses elegiac prose and a sweeping vision of man’s technological future as only he can. . . .” —Booklist\n\nHere they come, and they’re out for blood. For too long, they say, have hot blooded babes in brass bras and chain link bikinis been held up to scorn as the embodiment of male fantasy wish-fulfillment and non-fictionality. You think their swords won’t cut, their clubs won’t crush? You think they look cute?\n\nIt’s time to take sword-swinging amazons more seriously. Well, maybe not too seriously. After all, the popular Chicks in Chainmail series wasn’t known for stark drama and solemn think-pieces. In fact, they made a lot of people laugh. And now the first three books in the series are combined in one volume.\n\n· Chicks in Chainmail (The look at the lighter side of amazons that started it all.)\n\n· Did You Say Chicks? (Smile when you say that, you wimpy noncombatant!)\n\n· Chicks ‘n Chained Males (Those men just can’t take care of themselves, so send in the amazons!)\n\nIt’s all right to have a laugh or two. The swordswomen like a good laugh as much as the next amazon. Just don’t let them get the idea that you’re laughing at them, instead of with them—if you know what’s good for you . . .\n\nStories of fierce female fighters by Harry Turtledove, Roger Zelazny, Elizabeth Moon, Jan and S.M. Stirling, K. D. Wentworth, Lawrence Watt-Evans and more—including Esther Friesner herself.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEsther Friesner is winner twice over of the coveted Nebula Award (for the Year’s Best short Story, 1995 and 1996) and is the author of over thirty novels, including the USA Today best-seller Warchild, and more than one hundred short stories. For Baen she edited the five popular “Chicks in Chainmail” anthologies. Her works have been published in the UK, Japan, Germany, Russia, France and Italy. She lives in Connecticut with her husband, two children, and two rambunctious cats.\n\nThe colony worlds Adirondack and Silvern fell to the Troft forces almost without a struggle. Outnumbered and on the defensive, Earth made a desperate decision. It would attack the aliens not from space, but on the ground—with forces the Trofts did not even suspect. Thus were created the Cobras, a guerilla force whose weapons were surgically implanted, invisible to the unsuspecting eye, yet undeniably deadly. And the Moreau family were the most famous of the Cobra warriors.\n\nLong after victory over the Troft was achieved, the Cobras made common cause with their former adversaries against a new enemy. Their reward was three planets that would be a home for the Cobras, whose deadly powers made them too dangerous to feel at home on Earth.\n\nNow, years had passed and not everyone on the Cobra worlds thought that the Cobras were worth the high cost of providing their training and maintaining their existing built-in weaponry, let alone supporting research to improve the Cobra weapons, and possibly even put an end to the negative effects of that built-in weaponry, which caused Cobras to die much too young. Many who had never known interplanetary war were convinced that the Cobras were not needed at all.\n\nThat was a grave miscalculation, because a new menace was approaching, one that even the formidable Cobra warriors might not be able to defeat . . .\n\nAbout the Author\n\nTimothy Zahn is a Hugo Award-winner, and author of the New York Times best seller Heir to the Empire. Born in Chicago, he earned a B.S. in physics from Michigan State University and an M.S. in physics from the University of Illinois. He sold his first story to Analog in 1978, and immediately attracted attention as a new writer of science fiction based on real, cutting-edge science. Baen recently published his popular Cobra trilogy in one volume. His other popular series include the \"Conqueror\" and \"Dragonback\" novels. Zahn has written over twenty novels, including the recent works Angelmass and Manta's Gift."
