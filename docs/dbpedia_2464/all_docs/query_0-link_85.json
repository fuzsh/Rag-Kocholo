        "text": "Craggy-faced, dependable star character actor Van Heflin never quite made the Hollywood \"A\" list, but made up for what he lacked in appearance with hard work, charisma and solid acting performances. He was born Emmett Evan Heflin in Oklahoma in December 1908, the son of Fanny Bleecker (Shippey) and Emmett Evan Heflin, a dental surgeon. When his parents separated his brother and sister stayed with his mother, while he was farmed out to his grandmother in California. He was never quite settled and his restless spirit led him to ship out on a tramp steamer after graduating from school. After a year at sea he studied for a law degree at the University of Oklahoma, but after two years he decided he had enough and went back to sailing the Pacific. When he returned he decided to try his hand at acting and enrolled at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. His first foray into theatre was the comedy \"Mister Moneypenny\" (1928) (credited as \"Evan Heflin\"). It was indifferently received and Van went back to sea, this time for three years. In 1934 he returned to the stage in the plays \"The Bride of Torozko\" and \"The Night Remembers\", both outright disasters.\n\nHis big break came in 1936, when he landed a good leading role as a radical leftist at odds with the established elite in the S.N. Behrman comedy of manners, \"End of Summer\" at the Guild Theatre. Critic Brooks Atkinson, praising the play and the actors, commended the \"sparkling dialogue\" and \"fluent and sunny performance\" (New York Times, February 18 1936). Katharine Hepburn, who saw him on stage, then persuaded Van to take a swing at film acting and finagled a role for him alongside her in the Pandro S. Berman production Ein aufsässiges Mädchen (1936). Van spent a year at RKO in forgettable films, with roles ranging from a reverend in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1937) to a top-billed part as a burnt-out quarterback in Saturday's Heroes (1937). By 1939 Van was back on stage, rather more successfully, in \"The Philadelphia Story\" at the Shubert Theatre. The hit play, which also starred Vera Allen, Shirley Booth and Joseph Cotten, ran for 417 performances, closing in March 1940. That same year he appeared for Warner Brothers in the entertaining but historically inaccurate western Land der Gottlosen (1940), Bosley Crowther describing his performance, above other cast members, as containing \"the sharpest punch\" (New York Times, December 21 1940).\n\nOn the strength of these performances, Van was signed to a contract at MGM, where he remained for eight years (1941-49). His tenure was interrupted only by two years of wartime service as a combat photographer with the U.S. 9th Air Force, First Motion Picture Unit, which produced training and morale-boosting short films. Back at MGM, his third assignment at the studio, Der Tote lebt (1941), had proved an excellent showcase for his acting skills. He played Jeff Hartnett, right-hand man of the titular crime figure (Robert Taylor), a complex, sardonic character, at once loyal soldier yet abjectly self-loathing. For his role as the heavy-drinking, Shakespeare-quoting mobster with a conscience, Van got the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor in 1942. He was immediately cast in the leading role as a forensically-minded detective in Der Gentleman-Killer (1942), a film which marked the debut of Fred Zinnemann as a feature director. This was in turn followed by another B-movie whodunit, Grand Central Murder (1942).\n\nThe prestigious--but not always accurate--historical drama Tennessee Johnson (1942) saw Van playing Andrew Johnson, the 17th US president. While the film was a critical success, it did less well at the box office. The New York Times commented on the \"sincerity and strength\" of his performance, adding \"Mr. Heflin, in a full-bodied, carefully delineated portrait of a passionate man, gives decisive proof that his talents have thus far been haphazardly used\" (January 13, 1943). In between wartime service and two musicals, Bühne frei für Lily Mars (1943) and the Jerome Kern biopic Bis die Wolken vorüberzieh'n (1946), Van appeared in the excellent film noir Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck (as the inevitable femme fatale) and Kirk Douglas (as an alcoholic district attorney). As the sympathetic gambler Sam who returns to his home town, ostensibly to expose the dirty secrets of the main protagonists, Van had more on-screen time than his illustrious co-stars and some good lines to boot. Van put his tough-guy screen persona to good use in enacting Raymond Chandler's wisecracking gumshoe Philip Marlowe on NBC radio from June 1947, with 19 real-life Los Angeles detectives among the live audience.\n\nDuring the next few years the versatile Heflin dealt capably with a wide variety of assignments. He appeared as a jilted lover in the expensively-produced costume drama Taifun (1947); he was Athos, one of Die drei Musketiere (1948) and an ex-GI on the trail of a psychopathic prison camp informer in Fred Zinnemann's Akt der Gewalt (1948); poignant as the unloved Monsieur Bovary in Madame Bovary (1949); an ex-cop in love with a high-flying socialite in the melodrama Verlorenes Spiel (1949); and a cop whose affair with a married woman leads to a plot to kill her husband in Dem Satan singt man keine Lieder (1951).\n\nThe 1950s saw Van's progression from leading man to star character actor. Having left MGM in 1949, he was signed in this capacity to several short-term contracts by Universal (1951-54), 20th Century Fox (1954), Columbia (1957-59) and Paramount (1959-60). Apart from the big-business drama Morgen trifft es dich (1956), he is best remembered in this decade for his portrayal of western characters with integrity and singularity of purpose: as the struggling homesteader at the mercy of a ruthless cattle baron who befriends Mein großer Freund Shane (1953); the desperate, single-minded rancher trying to get a captured outlaw on the Zähl bis drei und bete (1957); and the tough, uncompromisingly stern father forced to kill his errant son in Duell im Morgengrauen (1958).\n\nWith the possible exception of his sympathetic German captain of a World War II surface raider in the offbeat international co-production Unter zehn Flaggen (1960) (aka \"Under Ten Flags\"), Heflin had few roles of note in the 1960s. He appeared in the calamitous flop Die größte Geschichte aller Zeiten (1965) and the equally disastrous San Fernando (1966) remake. One of his last performances was as the deranged bomber in Airport (1970). His final curtain call on stage was as Robert Sloane in \"A Case of Libel\" (1963-64) on Broadway.\n\nUnlike many of his peers, Van shunned the limelight and was never a part of the Hollywood glamour set. A well-liked, introspective and talented performer, he died of a heart attack in July 1971, aged just 62.\n\nThere are very few character actors from the 1930s, '40s or '50s who rose to the rank of stardom. Only a rare man or woman reached the level of renown and admiration, and had enough audience appeal, to be the first name in a cast's billing, a name that got marquee posting. Charles Coburn comes to mind, but there aren't many others. However, one who made it was Edmund Gwenn.\n\nGwenn was born Edmund Kellaway in Wandsworth, London, on September 26, 1877. He was the oldest boy in the family, which at that time meant he was the only one who really mattered. His father was a British civil servant, and he groomed Edmund to take a position of power in the Empire. However, early on, the boy had a mind of his own. For a while, his inclination was to go to sea, but that ended when one of his forebear's in the Queen's Navy was court-martialed for exceeding his \"wine bill\". In addition to that, Edmund had poor eyesight and perhaps most importantly, he was his mother's darling, and she kept having visions of shipwrecks and desert island strandings. As for the civil service, to the boy it seemed like a \"continent of unexplored boredom\".\n\nHe attended St. Olaf's College and would attend King's College in London as well. Surprisingly, he excelled at rugby and amateur boxing. Meanwhile, he developed a strong inclination to the stage, partly because of his admiration for the great English actor, Henry Irving. A major roadblock to that ambition, however, was his father, who, at that time, was stationed in Ireland. When Edmund broke the news to his father that he had chosen acting as a career, there followed \"a scene without parallel in Victorian melodrama.\" His father called the theatre \"that sink of iniquity.\" He predicted that, if Edmund went into theatre, he would end up in the gutter, and then literally \"showed him the door.\" Years later his father would admit he had been wrong, but that didn't help the young man during an all-night crossing from Dublin to England during which he had time to reflect. He was penniless. His experience consisted of a few performances in amateur productions, and he knew that if he failed, there was no going back home.\n\nHowever, in 1895, at the age of eighteen, he made his first appearance on the English stage with a group of amateurs just turned professional, playing two roles, \"Dodo Twinkle\" and \"Damper\", in \"Rogue and Vagabond\". For a long time afterward, he refused to go on stage without a false beard or some other disguise, fearing someone would recognize him and tell his father (it's a bit ironic, by the way, that Edmund's younger brother Arthur would also become an actor using the name of Arthur Chesney). During the next few years, roles were hard to come by but, by 1899, he made his first appearance on the West End in London in \"A Jealous Mistake\". This was followed by ten years in the hinterlands acting with stock and touring companies, gradually working his way up from small parts to juicier roles. While with Edmund Tearle's Repertory Company, which toured the provinces, he played a different role each night. It was excellent training, in that he acted in everything from William Shakespeare to old melodrama.\n\nAbout this time, he married Minnie Terry, niece of the more famous actress Ellen Terry, a marriage that evidently was short-lived. Most sources list it as beginning and ending in 1901, perhaps only for a matter of days or even hours. From that point, Gwenn would remain a bachelor for the rest of his life. He seems to have preferred not going into any details about the marriage and divorce, and Minnie Terry, who outlived Gwenn, apparently never mentioned what happened, at least not publicly. That same year, however, he went to Australia and acted there for three years, not returning to London until 1904. There, he took a small part in \"In the Hospital\", which led to his receiving a postcard from George Bernard Shaw, offering him a leading role as \"Straker\", the Cockney chauffeur, in \"Man and Superman\". Gwenn accepted (by this time he was Edmund Gwenn) and the play was a success. Shaw became a sort of professional godfather for him. He appeared in \"John Bull's Island\", \"Major Barbara\", \"You Never Can Tell\", \"Captain Brassbound's Conversion\" and \"The Devil's Disciple\", all by Shaw. He spent three years in Shaw's company, years which he called \"the happiest I've ever had in the theatre\".\n\nFrom 1908 until 1915, he performed in new plays by noted playwrights of the time, including John Masefield's \"The Campden Wonder\", 'John Galsworthy''s \"Justice\" and \"The Skin Game\", J.M. Barrie's \"What Every Woman Knows\" and \"The Twelve Pound Look\", as well as Henrik Ibsen's \"The Wild Duck\" and Harley Granville-Barker's \"The Voysey Inheritance\". By this time, World War I had started and Gwenn, despite his poor eyesight, was conscripted into the British Army. Most of his time during \"The Great War\" was spent drawing supplies up to the front lines, while under fire. He was so successful at this task that, after a year as a private, he received a steady stream of promotions until eventually becoming a captain.\n\nAfter the War, he returned to the stage and, in 1921, made his first appearance in the US in \"A Voice from the Minaret\" and \"Fedora\". He would return to America in 1928 to replace his friend, Dennis Eadie, who had died while in rehearsal for \"The House of Arrows\", but for most of this time, he was in England doing more stage roles and two dozen British films.\n\nHis first appearance on screen was in a British short, The Real Thing at Last (1916) in 1916, while he was still in the army. His next film roles were in Shaw's How He Lied to Her Husband (1931) and J.B. Priestley's The Good Companions (1933). He was also in Unmarried (1920) in 1920 and a silent version of \"The Skin Game\" (The Skin Game (1921)) as \"Hornblower\", a role he would reprise in 1931 for a talking version (Bis aufs Messer (1931)) directed by Alfred Hitchcock. From then on, Gwenn was to work steadily until the end of his life. He appeared in English stage plays and films, eventually doing more and more on Broadway and in Hollywood. For example, he played the amiable counterfeiter in \"Laburnum Grove\" in 1933 (later to become the film Laburnum Grove (1936) in which he would star) and then with the entire British company brought it to New York. He was also a huge success in \"The Wookey\" in 1942, playing a Cockney tugboat captain. That same year, he appeared as \"Chebutykin\" in Anton Chekhov's \"The Three Sisters\", with Katharine Cornell, Ruth Gordon and Judith Anderson. In such illustrious company, Gwenn was hailed by critics as \"magnificent\" and \"superlatively good\".\n\nIn 1935, RKO summoned him to Hollywood to portray Katharine Hepburn's father in Sylvia Scarlett (1935). From then on, he was much in demand, appearing in Ein rastloses Leben (1936), All American Chump (1936), Parnell (1937), and Der Lausbub aus Amerika (1938). In 1940, he was the delightful \"Mr. Bennet\" in Stolz und Vorurteil (1940), then made a 180-degree turn by playing a folksy assassin in Alfred Hitchcock's Der Auslandskorrespondent (1940). The year 1941 brought Cheers for Miss Bishop (1941), One Night in Lisbon (1941), Mary und der Millionär (1941) and Scotland Yard (1941). Then came Charley's Aunt (1941), in which he romanced Jack Benny, masquerading as a woman. Other important films included A Yank at Eton (1942), The Meanest Man in the World (1943), Schlüssel zum Himmelreich (1944) and Between Two Worlds (1944).\n\nIn 1945, he played villain \"Albert Richard Kingby\" in Gefährliche Partnerschaft (1945). There is a peculiar scene in this film, which makes one wonder what director Edward L. Cahn was thinking. James Craig and Signe Hasso, the hero and heroine, are being held by the villainous Gwenn in a room, when Gwenn comes in to interrogate them. In the midst of this, the 33-year-old, 6'2\" Craig punches the 68-year-old, 5'5\" Gwenn in the belly and then forces the doubled-over Gwenn to release them. Admittedly, Craig and Hasso must escape, and Gwenn's character is pretty evil, but knocking the wind out of the old man makes Craig seem like a bully and far less sympathetic.\n\nAfter \"Dangerous Partners\", Gwenn was in Bewitched (1945), She Went to the Races (1945), Of Human Bondage (1946), Der unbekannte Geliebte (1946), Unser Leben mit Vater (1947), Taifun (1947) and Eine Dachkammer für zwei (1948). In Thunder in the Valley (1947), he played one of his most unlikable characters, a father who beats his son, smashes his violin and shoots his dog.\n\nThen in 1947, he struck it rich. Twentieth Century-Fox was planning Das Wunder von Manhattan (1947). It had offered the role of \"Kris Kringle\" to Gwenn's cousin, the well-known character actor Cecil Kellaway, but he had turned it down with the observation that \"Americans don't like whimsy\". Fox then offered it to Gwenn, who pounced on it. His performance was to earn him an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor (at age 71) and, because it is rerun every Christmas season, he would become for many their all-time favorite screen Santa. Accepting the award, Gwenn said, \"Now I know there is a Santa Claus\". He beat out some stiff competition: Charles Bickford (Die Farmerstochter (1947)), Thomas Gomez (Reite auf dem rosa Pferd (1947)), Robert Ryan (Kreuzfeuer - Crossfire (1947)) and Richard Widmark (Der Todeskuß (1947)). As soon as he got the part, Gwenn went to work turning himself into Santa Claus. Though rotund, Gwenn didn't feel he was rotund enough to look like the jolly old elf most people expected after having read Clement Moore's \"The Night before Christmas\", in which Santa \"had a broad face and a little round belly / That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.\" He could of course wear padding, but he resisted that as too artificial. So he put on almost 30 pounds for the role, a fair amount for a man of his short stature, and added nearly five inches to his waistline. The problem was that after the film was finished, Gwenn found it hard to lose the extra weight. \"I've been stocky all my adult life,\" he said, \"but now I must accept the fact that I'm fat.\" As was his nature, he didn't get upset, and instead was able to laugh about it. Six years later, when playing an elderly professor in Alt Heidelberg (1954), he had a scene in which he entered the Prince's chamber, struggling with the buttons of a ceremonial uniform. The line he was given was, \"I'm too old to wear a uniform,\" but Gwenn suggested a change which stayed in the finished film, \"I'm too old and fat to wear a uniform.\"\n\nGwenn had lost his hair early on, and had no more concern about it than he did about his portliness. In a fair number of films, such as Stolz und Vorurteil (1940), he appears bald, but he also played many roles with a toupee if he felt that worked better for the character. He would select a hairpiece that helped achieve the look he was after for the role. As regards the rest of his appearance, Gwenn is commonly listed as 5'6\" tall, which may have been accurate when he was a younger man, but by the time he was a Hollywood regular he appears to be at least two inches shorter. Plagued by weak eyesight since his youth, Gwenn wore a pince-nez for a while, and then glasses, off-screen and sometimes on. Though he enjoyed fine clothes, he does not seem to have been in the least bit vain about any physical shortcomings he may have had. He looked a bit like a benign clergyman, perhaps of the Anglican faith, an image enhanced by his soft, almost soothing voice. He once said he was \"always short and stocky, and not a particularly handsome thing. I could never play romantic leads.\" After \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" however, Gwenn was a star and constantly in demand, especially when the role called for a kindly eccentric.\n\nGwenn remained a British subject all his life. When he first moved to Hollywood, he lived at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. His home in London had been reduced to rubble during the bombings by the Luftwaffe in World War II. Only the fireplace survived. What Gwenn regretted most was the loss of the memorabilia he had collected of the famous actor Henry Irving. Eventually Gwenn bought a house at 617 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, which he was to share with his secretary and \"confidential man\", Ernest C. Bach, and later with former Olympic athlete Rodney Soher.\n\nThe year 1950 brought a pair of interesting films. In Alter schützt vor Liebe nicht (1950) he and Charles Coburn were romantic rivals for the hand of Spring Byington. In one scene Gwenn socks Coburn in the jaw, though Coburn later bests him in arm wrestling. Gwenn wins Byington's hand in the end. He was also delightful in Mister 880 (1950) as a kindly counterfeiter. Gwenn received his second Oscar nomination for his performance, though this time he lost out to George Sanders in Alles über Eva (1950) He did, however, win the Golden Globe Award.\n\nIn 1952 he appeared in Sally and Saint Anne (1952) as Grandpa Patrick Ryan, affecting an Irish brogue for the role. He played football coach Pop Doyle, teamed up with a chimpanzee, in Bonzo Goes to College (1952). \"The Student Prince\" followed in 1954, as did the science-fiction classic Formicula (1954). This film raises an interesting observation. The year before, Cecil Kellaway had appeared in another sci-fi classic, Panik in New York (1953). Watch the two films together and you'll see that the two cousins are playing essentially the same role, that of an elderly scientist with a lovely daughter who is able to provide the hero, and the audience, with some scholarly background on the dangers they face. The two actors could easily have switched roles. \"Them!\" is noteworthy, too, in that it was a particularly physically painful part for Gwenn. By this time he was 77 and suffering from advanced arthritis. Several scenes in the movie were filmed in the desert, where the temperature often reached 110 degrees. The costumer had outfitted him in a wool suit for some of the early scenes. Joan Weldon, who played his daughter, has noted that Gwenn was in great discomfort and almost certainly could not have continued without the help of his valet, Ernest.\n\nThe next year Gwenn was in Ein Hundeleben (1955) and Immer Ärger mit Harry (1955). His film work has some interesting patterns. \"Dog's Life\" was at least the third time Gwenn made a film centered on a dog. He had already co-starred with Pal as Lassie in Heimweh (1943) and Lassie in Not (1949). \"Harry\" was Gwenn's fourth picture directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the others being \"The Skin Game\", Waltzes from Vienna (1934) and \"Foreign Correspondent\". Gwenn's last feature film was Calabuig (1956), shot in Spain and released in 1958, when he was 81. As for TV, his most memorable role may have been as a snowman that comes to life in a Christmas night telecast on The Ford Television Theatre (1952) from a story by Nathaniel Hawthorne, \"Heart of Gold\".\n\nGwenn's final days were spent at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. Having endured terrible arthritis for many years, he had suffered a stroke, and then contracted pneumonia, from which he died at age 81 on September 6, 1959. His body was cremated, and his ashes were originally stored in a private vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. In March 2023, Gwenn's misplaced urn was found in the vault by Hollywood Graveyard creator Arthur Dark and researcher Jessical Wahl. Dark and Wahl created a GoFundMe campaign to fund moving Gwenn's urn to a publicly accessible location and, on December 3, 2023, Gwenn's urn was reinurned in the Cathedral Mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nGwenn had appointed Rodney Soher as the executor of his will, in which he had left Minnie Terry one-third of his estate, his sister Elsie Kellaway a third, and Ernest Bach a third, in addition to his clothes, shoes, linens, ties and luggage. However, for some reason, while he was spending his last days at the Motion Picture Home, Gwenn signed a codicil to his will, in which he said he had given Bach the lump sum of $5000, and that was all he was to receive. After Gwenn's death, Bach challenged the codicil, claiming that Gwenn was not of sound mind while in the Home and that some unnamed person--possibly referring to Soher--had unduly influenced Gwenn to change his will. The outcome is not known. There is a story that has been around for years that shortly before he died a visitor observed, \"It must be hard [to die]\", to which Gwenn replied, \"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard\". The story and the wording vary somewhat from teller to teller. Gwenn may indeed have said it, but he may have been repeating someone else. The quotation has also been ascribed to several earlier wits, including his mentor George Bernard Shaw and the famous actor Edward Keane. Gwenn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be found at 1751 Vine Street.\n\nAnthony Quinn was born Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca (some sources indicate Manuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca) on April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, to Manuela (Oaxaca) and Francisco Quinn, who became an assistant cameraman at a Los Angeles (CA) film studio. His paternal grandfather was Irish, and the rest of his family was Mexican.\n\nAfter starting life in extremely modest circumstances in Mexico, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up in the Boyle Heights and Echo Park neighborhoods. He played in the band of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson as a youth and as a deputy preacher. He attended Polytechnic High School and later Belmont High, but eventually dropped out. The young Quinn boxed (which stood him in good stead as a stage actor, when he played Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" to rave reviews in Chicago), then later studied architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the great architect's studio, Taliesin, in Arizona. Quinn was close to Wright, who encouraged him when he decided to give acting a try. Made his credited film debut in Parole! (1936). After a brief apprenticeship on stage, Quinn hit Hollywood in 1936 and picked up a variety of small roles in several films at Paramount, including an Indian warrior in Verrat - Ein amerikanisches Duell (1936), which was directed by the man who later became his father-in-law, Cecil B. DeMille.\n\nAs a contract player at Paramount, Quinn's roles were mainly ethnic types, such as an Arab chieftain in the Bing Crosby-Bob Hope comedy, Der Weg nach Marokko (1942). As a Mexican national (he did not become an American citizen until 1947), he was exempt from the draft. With many other actors in military service during WWII, he was able to move up into better supporting roles. He married DeMille's daughter Katherine DeMille, which afforded him entrance to the top circles of Hollywood society. He became disenchanted with his career and did not renew his Paramount contract despite the advice of others, including his father-in-law, with whom he did not get along (whom Quinn reportedly felt had never accepted him due to his Mexican roots; the two men were also on opposite ends of the political spectrum) but they eventually were able to develop a civil relationship. Quinn returned to the stage to hone his craft. His portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in Chicago and on Broadway (where he replaced the legendary Marlon Brando, who is forever associated with the role) made his reputation and boosted his film career when he returned to the movies.\n\nBrando and Elia Kazan, who directed \"Streetcar\" on Broadway and on film (Endstation Sehnsucht (1951)), were crucial to Quinn's future success. Kazan, knowing the two were potential rivals due to their acclaimed portrayals of Kowalski, cast Quinn as Brando's brother in his biographical film of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, Viva Zapata (1952). Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for 1952, making him the first Mexican-American to win an Oscar. It was not to be his lone appearance in the winner's circle: he won his second Supporting Actor Oscar in 1957 for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli's biographical film of Vincent van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh - Ein Leben in Leidenschaft (1956), opposite Kirk Douglas. Over the next decade Quinn lived in Italy and became a major figure in world cinema, as many studios shot films in Italy to take advantage of the lower costs (\"runaway production\" had battered the industry since its beginnings in the New York/New Jersey area in the 1910s). He appeared in several Italian films, giving one of his greatest performances as the circus strongman who brutalizes the sweet soul played by Giulietta Masina in her husband Federico Fellini's masterpiece Das Lied der Straße (1954). He met his second wife, Jolanda Addolori, a wardrobe assistant, while he was in Rome filming Barabbas (1961).\n\nAlternating between Europe and Hollywood, Quinn built his reputation and entered the front rank of character actors and character leads. He received his third Oscar nomination (and first for Best Actor) for George Cukor's Wild ist der Wind (1957). He played a Greek resistance fighter against the Nazi occupation in the monster hit Die Kanonen von Navarone (1961) and received kudos for his portrayal of a once-great boxer on his way down in Rod Serling's Die Faust im Gesicht (1962). He went back to playing ethnic roles, such as an Arab warlord in David Lean's masterpiece Lawrence von Arabien (1962), and he played the eponymous lead in the \"sword-and-sandal\" blockbuster Barabbas (1961). Two years later, he reached the zenith of his career, playing Zorba the Greek in the film of the same name (a.k.a. Alexis Sorbas (1964)), which brought him his fourth, and last, Oscar nomination as Best Actor. The 1960s were kind to him: he played character leads in such major films as The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) and Das Geheimnis von Santa Vittoria (1969). However, his appearance in the title role in the film adaptation of John Fowles' novel, Teuflische Spiele (1968), did nothing to save the film, which was one of that decade's notorious turkeys.\n\nIn the 1960s, Quinn told Life magazine that he would fight against typecasting. Unfortunately, the following decade saw him slip back into playing ethnic types again, in such critical bombs as Der große Grieche (1978). He starred as the Hispanic mayor of a southwestern city on the short-lived television series The Man and the City (1971), but his career lost its momentum during the 1970s. Aside from playing a thinly disguised Aristotle Onassis in the cinematic roman-a-clef Der große Grieche (1978), his other major roles of the decade were as Hamza in the controversial Mohammed - Der Gesandte Gottes (1976) (a.k.a. \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\"); as the Italian patriarch in Das Erbe der Ferramonti (1976); yet another Arab in Der Herr der Karawane (1978); and as a Mexican patriarch in Die Kinder von Sanchez (1978). In 1983, he reprised his most famous role, Zorba the Greek, on Broadway in the revival of the musical \"Zorba\" for 362 performances (opposite Lila Kedrova, who had also appeared in the film, and won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance). His career slowed during the 1990s but he continued to work steadily in films and television, including an appearance with frequent film co-star Maureen O'Hara in Mama, ich und wir zwei (1991).\n\nQuinn lived out the latter years of his life in Bristol, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his time painting and sculpting. Beginning in 1982, he held numerous major exhibitions in cities such as Vienna, Paris, and Seoul. He died in a hospital in Boston at age 86 from pneumonia and respiratory failure linked to his battle with throat cancer."
