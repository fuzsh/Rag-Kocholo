        "text": "The State of New York Fisheries, Game and Forest Commission hired Sherman Foote Denton to illustrate their annual reports from 1895-1907. Denton painted more than 100 hundred wildlife watercolors for the Commission. Through his artistry and with a focus on coloration, his wildlife creatures come alive on the page. These illustrations are memorialized in vivid chromolighograph format with these publications. His artistic accomplishments set the bar for all future wildlife artists, most notably in the area of fish recreations. He sought to capture the true color of live fish scales before they fade when dry. Admired for more than 100 years, these specific detailed artworks document a range of species of North American fish, birds, moose, deer, and bear. Today, Rare Print Sellers often sell these original Denton prints individually. Thanks to the Franklin B. Lord Family's bequest to LIU of the Franklin B. Lord Hunting and Fishing Collection, we are fortunate to house all 100 of these original prints produced by the New York State Fisheries, Game and Forest Commission of 1902. They are available in Archives and Special Collections for viewing and research purposes.\n\nSherman Denton had an unconventional childhood. From an early age, he traveled extensively, including a trip with his brothers to the Western United States and later with his geologist father on an expedition to Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. A naturalist, geologist and artist in training, he sketched and brought back many wildlife specimens. He grew to become the leading maker of fish models for collectors and museums such as the Smithsonian, the Field Museum in Chicago and the Agassiz Museum at Harvard. Beyond his accomplishments as a naturalist, geologist, traveler and artist, he was a collector. Among his many collecting interests, he reportedly owned a significant gem collection and the largest fresh water pearl collection in the United States.\n\nSherman was born in Dayton, Ohio to William and Elizabeth Foote Denton. His family, who were avid naturalists, moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts when he was a boy in the 1860s. Sherman Foote Denton's entire archive is housed at the Wellesley Historical Society in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nFor further information about Denton, you may contact Ms. Taylor Kalloch, Archivist and Collections Manager at the Wellesley Historical Society where Sherman's entire archives are housed.\n\nBook Selections from The Franklin B.
