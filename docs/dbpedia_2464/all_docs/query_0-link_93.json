An inquest was held by Justice Putney, and it was decided that he came to his death by drink and exposure. It appears he had been lying at the place for a day or two, and numbers passing noticed him, but perhaps thinking he was sleeping off a debauch, did not minister to his wants. Some employes of the railroad furnished him water last Friday. He was brought in and buried by the county last Saturday.

The funeral took place Monday afternoon at the Masonic [Odd Fellows] Cemetery, Rev. J. C. Wilson, Methodist pastor, officiating.

Few men possessed as many friends and admirers as did Mr. Hall. His word was as good as any mans bond.

Hall is that man,\" and all our people, rich and poor, high and low, white and black. knew it to be true. Few men ever lived such an exemplary life as did this grand. good man. Of quiet, unassuming habits, only those who had dealings with him or who possessed his confidence realized what a depth of character, manhood, integrity and all those attributes that go to make up the true type of gentleman were possessed by John A. Hail. Charitable to a fault. no deserving case ever passed unaided, and while the world may not have known of all these good deeds, many a widow, orphan, or pour beggar has had cause to bless him for his munificence, and while tears course down their cheeks will pray God to reward him for his kindness to the forlorn and forsaken poor of this earth. He was a consistent member of the Methodist church; also a member of tile Masonic Order, Odd Fellows and United Workman, He will be buried this (Saturday) morning at 10 o'clock at the Odd Fellows' cemetery. under the auspices of the Masonic lodge of this city.\n\nMr. Hall was born in Christian county, Ky., in 1844 and was about 56 years of age at the time of his death. He came to Texas with his parents in 1851, first settling in Washington county thence moving to Fayette county, and from there to this communityity, where he resided almost continually with the exception of four years' absence in the service of his country as a faithful and gallant Confederate soldier. For many years and up to the time of his decease, he was in the lumber business in this city. He leaves a heartbroken wife and one daughter. a brother, F. M. Hall of Round Rock, and one sister, Mrs. J, M. Harrison of Flatonia, besides a large number of relatives and friends as numerous as the sands of the seashore.

Chumney, in Colorado county, Texas, August 17, 1881, of dropsy, Mrs. Ann E. Hamlin, aged 66 years, 8 months and 4 days.\n\nThe subject of this notice was born in Lunenburg county, Virginia, where she was raised and educated. Being possesed[sic] of remarkable beauty and attractiveness, she was married young, and took upon herself the duties of wife and mother, in which capacity she was exceedingly happy for a time, there never having been a more devoted wife and mother; but alas! the reaper came and of eight children only left her two, and in 1849 her husband was swept off with cholera in Missouri, with but little warning. The storm of adversity shattered her fabric of happiness. So frequent, so heavy were the shocks that it is no wonder she, for the remainder of her days, lay stunned among ruins, seeing the society of only a few friends, by whom she was dearly loved, and devoting her remaining strength to caring for her grand-children, whom she almost idolized, and thought their every wish must be gratified. She was fully aware of her situation for several months, and expressed a willingness to go, yet at the last she would each succeeding morning wish to be spared to see another that she might have the pleasure of seeing the bright faces and hearing the sweet voices of her three little grandchildren.\n\n“Alas! ye might have dragged me on,\n\nAnother day, a single one.”\n\nBeing a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and one of whom aught was ever said except in praise, her relatives and friends should feel assured she is at rest.
