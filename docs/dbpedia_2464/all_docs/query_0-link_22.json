        "text": "(updated 9-4-2009)\n\nResources for Genealogical Research\n\nThe Dolph Briscoe Center for American History houses numerous materials useful in the study of genealogy during the Texas colonial period. Most of the information beneficial for genealogy during this time period is located in the manuscript collections. Those collections include a wide range of materials, such as censuses, birth records, marriage records, baptismal records, death records, title and land grant information, correspondence, printed materials, mission reports, and reports of colonial officials. Much of the information is in Spanish, although some collections include English translations.\n\nManuscripts and Archives\n\nSpanish Material from Various Source Collections, 1600–1890\n\nSelected Publications Available at the Center for American History\n\nOther Resources Available at the Benson Latin American Center\n\nManuscripts and Archives\n\nArchivo General de las Indias – Audiencia de Guadalajara, 1592–1821. (54 vols.) Audiencia de México, 1590–1819. (72 vols.)\n\nThe Center owns copies of large sections of the Archivo General de las Indias (AGI), the archives that contain all official information pertaining to Spanish colonial rule in the Americas. During the colonial period, Texas fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia de Guadalajara. The Audiencia de Guadalajara and Audiencia de México collections contain official reports, decrees, orders, correspondence, and inspection results associated with civil, military, economic, political, and religious life in Texas and Coahuila. They are particularly rich resources for the study of missions, early settlements, and relations with Indians. Among the documents found in the collection are partial censuses and lists of citizens of communities in the area. Most documents are photostat copies of the original manuscripts. These collections do include detailed calendars that briefly describe most documents in the collection.\n\nArchivo General de México – Archivo General de la Nación, 1560–1844. (25 ft.)\n\nAlong with portions of the Spanish Archivo General de las Indias, the Center also owns copies of portions of México’s Archivo General de México, or Archivo General de la Nación (AGM or AGN). This collection contains a wide variety of material dating from the early colonial period through the Texas independence and annexation periods. Early material includes mission and Inquisition reports from the area. Later material deals much more specifically with the Spanish and Mexican attempts to settle Texas, reports on conditions in the area, reports on military operations during the Mexican and Texas Independence wars, and relations between Mexican and United States officials during the annexation period. The collection contains a combination of photostat copies of original documents and transcriptions of original documents in Spanish.\n\nAustin Papers, 1676–1889. (9 ft., 6 in.)\n\nThe Austin papers consist of primarily the personal and official records of Moses Austin (1761–1821) and his son Stephen F.

(168 ft.)\n\nComprising 168 feet of documents, this collection is particularly useful for the investigation of the San Antonio, Nacogdoches, and La Bahia areas. Although documents date back to 1717, much of the archive is dedicated to the post 1800 time period. All aspects of Spanish and Mexican colonial life (military, civil, and ecclesiastical) receive attention in this collection. Documents discuss the foundation and maintenance of missions, presidios, San Antonio and Espiritu Santo, the settlement of Canary Islanders in the area, relationships with Native Americans, slavery, commerce, agriculture, Anglo-American settlement, the Mexican empire, the Texas Revolution, and the Republic of Texas. The collection includes various types of official reports, correspondence, diaries, legal proceedings, powers of attorney, contracts, depositions, affidavits, writs, wills, censuses, briefs, registers, summonses, testimonies, passports, and questionnaires. To aid research, there is a calendar available in the CAH reading room on the reference shelves. The archive is also available on microfilm. A three volume guide titled Guide to the Microfilm Edition of the Bexar Archives aids researchers using the archives in this form. The Bexar Archives (1717–1836): A Name Guide compiled by Adán Benavides Jr. is a valuable tool for locating individuals mentioned in the collection.

These lists do not provide the names of individuals, but they do report whether the individual was free (white) or slave, the month that the birth, death, or marriage occurred, and the age at which the event occurred. Statistical census information is broken down according to marital status (single, married, widowed), gender, and age.

Finally, this collection includes the certificates of admission giving non-Mexican citizens permission to settle in Texas. The calendar for the collection only covers the 1729 to 1819 time period.
