INTRODUCTION. A series of five maps of the United States showing the original Louisiana and the changes in its boundary during the 137 years between 1682, the date of La Salle’s discovery, and 1819, the date of the purchase of Florida, formed an interesting part of the exhibit of the General Land Office at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held at St. Louis, Mo., in 1904. Differences of opinion have pre- vailed as to the extent of Louisiana as purchased from France. It is believed that these are due, first, to a misconception of the scope of La Salle’s discovery and proclamation, and, second, to a mis- understanding of the real significance of the political acts of the United States, between 1803 and 1819, affecting that part of La Salle’s Louisiana which extended along the Gulf coast east of the Mississippi River. It is submitted, as to the former, that the “Lou- isiana Purchase” of 1803 did not include territory beyond the limits of the original Louisiana, and, as to the latter, that all Spanish doubts as to ownership were resolved and permanently settled by the political acts of the United States following the purchase from France, but antedating the purchase of Florida from Spain. It is believed, also, that a true picture of the extent and location of La Salle’s Louisiana is shown upon map No. 1. This picture greatly assists one to understand the phrase “the whole of Louisiana” which was used in subsequent treaties of cession. In the brief discussion of each map which follows no effort has been made to harmonize the conflicting viev^s held and heretofore published by numerous writers upon the subject of Louisiana or the “Louisiana Purchase.” These views are as diverse as their author- ship is numerous. This is not surprising when it is understood that the common effort has been aimed at solving the questions of terri- torial limits of Louisiana, as this province passed from one State to another, without first attempting to fix the original limits of the territory thus transfered. To this fact, probably, more than any other, may the failure to reach a common conclusion be attributed. TERRITORY OF LOUISIANA, 1682-1762 (MAP NO. 1). The greater colored area shown upon this map is based upon the discoveries of La Salle and his proclamation made at the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 9, KSS2.

Of which, and all that can be needed, I hereby take to witness those who hear me and demand an act of the notary as required by law.i Title to French territory in the Mississippi Valley and along the Gulf of Mexico was based upon this voyage and proclamation of La Salle. These acts of La Salle were, in fact, the foundation of French ownership, and have been so considered by all nations since 1682. The Louisiana thus claimed embraced two areas of contigu- ous territory — first, the territory drained by the Mississippi River, with all of its tributaries, and second, the territory between the Mississippi River and the River Palms. The wording of the proc- lamation is simple and direct, and its meaning seems incapable of distortion or of being misunderstood. It appears evident that La Salle had no information of territory beyond the source of the Mis- sissippi River and its tributaries to the west, or, if he knew of such territory, he purposely excluded any claim to it for France. The western boundary of the original Louisiana is therefore traced along the summit of the watershed which defines the drainage basin of the Mississippi in that region, viz., around the headwaters both of the iThis translation of La Salle’s proclamation is taken from Spark’s Life of La Salle, published at Boston, Mass.. 1844. Francis Parkinan’s translation of the proclamation, in his “Discovery of the Great West,” 1869 (Boston: Little, Brown 6s. Co.), agrees with the above, except that he omitted the names of the treaty tribes, but refers to such omissions in a footnote, pp. 282, 283, and says; “A copy of the original of the Proces Verbal (the proc- lamation) is before me. It bears the name of Jacques de ia Metairie, notary of Fronten.ac, w'ho was one of the party.” Translations, in whole or in p.art, of the proclamation of La Salle, by numerous other authors have been exam- ined by the writer, but in no essenti.al particular did any of these transla- tions differ from those of Sparks or Parkman quoted or referred to above. rrvTJOO xav mo * i ?j^viV“ I4. i!>n~v crm^i^a a briol n\\ ^liilrw ,«<mi^kro »; .»;;Tihr.tVv h<M> .#1:- :s^ ^., Oifit 3J«V1 lir«h r Iv -<*nl ^«iM»B««t,'f>'(l* tii tiKii ,a<jv~Uit _1^T^ iw»vrt*v ■.«••.; (i^Ul IW*’ ^:- »^H • ' TTII# i:. lo>..iiiOS «.fl iif:„ »bi;t,«>rtiiifj»f »! «’ri^ wiW i*i-,'jt^.>jr- w»>t 4mJ W> i!4i*oja «»li M. <w)ip Mf- >fn<T , ■ I'tivK niii V) 'j_ !>»}M»l»S^'Vo >*P^ (\"I\"' 'Safl9(ja:(ii5f ^t»nc2 «^1 ,'i lilt.

In the effort made to locate the western boundary of La Salle’s Louisiana many untenable claims have been put forth by geogra- phers. In one of those claims the province was carried far beyond the drainage basin of the Mississippi River; in fact, across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast in the Northwest. In another, it is assumed that because France at one time claimed the Gulf coast to St. Bernard (now Matagorda) Bay, by reason of La Salle’s later discoveries, this territory should be added to the original Louisi- ana. A third, while rejecting the Pacific coast extension, selected the Rio Grande as the southwestern boundary, but, lacking in courage of conviction, published maps restricting the limits on the west by the Spanish-American compromise line of 1819. The great majority of geographers now reject the Pacific coast exten- sion, but there remains a disposition to include the Plio Grande country. A careful study of available historical data reveals claims of France at one time extending only to the divide between the Colorado River and the Rio Grande at another time to the Rio Grande itself and with spiritual jurisdiction to the Pacific coast. In the negotiations with France for the purchase of Lou- isiana, Napoleon, Talleyrand, and Marbois admitted great ob- scurity as to boundaries and declared their inability to throw any light upon the subject. The negotiations incident to the treaty of 1819 and the maps showing the claims of the United States and Spain at the time seem to show that, for diplomatic reasons prob- ably, the United States claimed the territory to the Rio Grande. Spain declared this claim preposterous and fixed the equally ab- surd ninety-third degree of longtitude as her eastern and our west- ern limit. While the compromise line was not agreed to as fixing the western limits of the Louisiana purchase from France by the United States, but rather as definitely establishing a boundary be- tween Spanish and American territory west of the Mississippi River, it is perhaps significant that in its beginning east of the Texas territory in question, and in its course northwesterly to the forty-second parallel, this boundary appropriated the location of the true Louisiana boundary of La Salle. It is believed the claim for the Rio Grande limit is untenable, for the several reasons that the southern Texas country was a later discovery, and the reasons offered for its union with Louisiana are unconvincing and in- sufficient; its area was indefinite and its boundaries unknown; it was never made a part of La Salle’s Louisiana; doubt as to American tide was strong enough to insure a ready acceptance of the contention of Spain as to her ownership of this portion of the Gulf coast in 1819, and this acceptance was in marked contrast to the vigorous policy pursued in the Perdido River boundary con- tention, where American ownership by virtue of the “purchase” was declared and maintained by the Government of the United States. On the other hand, there is room for but one interpreta- ’j iV* j fi ' -:.K77}t \"\" ■ ■ : . SSSS i J Aflbil r -va14. SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY 11 tion of the limits of “Louisiana” as proclaimed by La Selle. It is the line defining the drainage basin of the Mississippi River on the west, and this line is therefore adopted as the “Louisiana Purchase” boundary through the present State of Texas. No available fact warrants the acceptance of the Spanish-American boundary of 1819, established 16 years after the purchase of Louisiana, as the boundary of this territory. It has been held that the Province of Louisiana as proclaimed by La Salle should be enlarged on the north by the addition of the territory south of the forty-ninth parallel and west of the head- waters of the Mississippi River; that is to say, by the drainage basin of the Red River of the North. It is certain that this terri- tory was not in La Salle’s Louisiana, and it is even doubtful that it ever really belonged to France. It is universally conceded that the powers signatory to the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, in the be- lief that the headwaters of the Mississippi River were north of the forty-ninth parallel, intended to confirm France in the possession, not of territory beyond the Mississippi drainage, but of Mississippi \\^alley territory which was proclaimed “Louisiana” by La Salle 31 years before. But French ownership, even if conceded, by virtue of the treaty of Utrecht, would be unimportant, for such concession would in no degree support the contention that the Red River Basin formed a part of Louisiana. All of the French territoiy to the north of La Salle’s Louisiana, of whatever extent east or west of the Great Lakes, was transferred to Great Britain in 1763, and no French claim to any part of it has appeared since that time. The origin of American title to the district north and west of the headwaters of the Mississippi River and south of the forty- ninth parallel may be found in the treaties between the United States and Great Britain of 1783 and 1817, the former defining ter- ritorial limits at the close of the Revolutionary War, and the latter fixing the forty-ninth parallel as the north boundary of the United States between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains. France having parted with the district affected by these treaties long prior to their negotiation by the powers interested, was wholly indifferent to the transfers of the territory made thereby. Ihe drainage basin of the Red River of the North is therefore excluded from the territory of Louisiana purchased from France in 1803. Referring to the extension of the south boundary of the original Louisiana territory, as shown on the map, appeal is again had to the proclamation of La Salle, who said, “And also to the mouth of the river Palms.” This river was located with some difficulty, dhc first mention of it was found in a large volume belonging to the records of the Divisions of Private Lands, etc.. General Land Oifice, entitled “A Complete Historical, Chronological, and Geo- graphical American Atlas, etc., published by Caiey and Lea, Phila- delphia, 1822.” In the historical data descriptive of Florida was found the record of a grant in 1526 to Pamphilo de Narvaez from Xf trviuO'j ;i-.V \\o TOi wraii 'm -z> il Mh^ ad .•wit Vi cKHi- a'? • ]qii:%hyhlfi ^4t io ^ f!^i,muQj. ■' 9(t>hvrtb bft* »J«*^w jwij Cfli ‘-fixoT Jo-'Ma.i?

Cape Florida is shown upon all modern maps, as well as ancient publications, but appeal to maps published early in the last century was necessary to locate Palm River. It emptied into Palm Sound, now called Sarasota Bay, and the southern extremity of Palm Island, which was also shown on the ancient maps, is opposite the mouth of the river. This island is now called Sarasota Key. This grant of land by Spain, 156 years before La Salle’s voyage down the IMis- sippi, was peculiar in that its limits were defined in specific terms. It is here noted merely as offering a reasonable suggestion for the action of La Salle in choosing Palm River as the eastern limit of Louisiana on the Gulf coast. The fact of his choice is un- questioned. Commercial rights over this original Louisiana, as far as the Illinois, for a period of 10 years, were granted by Louis XIV to Antoine de Crozat, September 14, 1712, and the territory itself was ceded to Spain by treaty of November 3, 1762, the language of the treaty being, “the whole country known under the name of Louisiana, together with New Orleans and the island on which that city stands.” This was the first transfer relating to the ter- ritory of Louisiana. TERRITORY OF LOUISIANA, 1762-1800 (MAP NO. 2). The great but partially temporary shrinkage in area of the ter- ritory of Louisiana, as shown by map No. 2, was caused, not by any changes in description of the territory ceded to Spain by treaty of November 3, 1762, but by the failure of France to deliver to Spain all of the territory described in that treaty, and was also due to the cession to Great Britain, by Spain in 1763, of all of her territory, undescribed as to boundaries, south of latitude 31° and east of the Mississippi River. Four months after the cession by France to Spain of “the whole territory known under the name of Louisiana,” the representatives of France and Spain and of Great Britain and Portugal met at Paris and entered into a treaty apparently intended to hx more definitely the boundaries of their respective possessions in North America. The attitude of Spain during these negotiations was inex- plicable. At this time she was one of the greatest of the powers, and it would be idle to assume that her diplomats were unaware of the claim of France during the previous 80 years to that part of Louisi- ana which lay east of the Mississippi River, especially when the comrnercial grant of Louis XIV to Crozat with its transfer to the Mississippi (To., 28 and 32 years before, not only definitely speci- fied this territory, but also had become a matter of wide-spread knowledge through the tremendous financial crisis and panic which followed the operations of the later grantee. It can only be assumed that Spanish reasons of state or the exigencies of di- plomacy permitted France to cede to Great Britain the territory fit M<l) ai fibnoH rrrpil Jfefcrt»i r>»*l4 H« ^<1\" J aiiivr^ ].\\ vj^'n fitdl' *\\catshM 1o Vlv^ ai dEqwiUl i^p It ti tp^l oih m ro fjism .Vf«1 il rwX#l M .oc^ oi iriw laTiv^sf r^ 4i !>Hj iif;#; r m ./ [tf/tt JiTsbnu 5fit rrO tv/oUe oilis’fki;// ! /}%,wca iil blhs,UKn ^td'i V v’wvn r to VtfnAfn 'Hli r: .....

Spain’s title to all of the territory south of latitude 31° at this time was undoubtedly good; for to her un- disputed title to that part of Florida which was obtained through discovery and colonization was added the strip of original Lou- isiana territory between the Mississippi River and the river Palms, obtained by the treaty of November 3, 1762. This tract is left uncolored upon the map, the same as the northern portions of the alienated Louisiana territory. TERRITORY OF LOUISIANA, 1800-1803 (MAP NO. 3). As indicated upon Map No. 3, the boundaries of the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River suffered no changes be- tween April 21, 1764, the date of delivery to Spain, and 1800, when the retrocession from Spain to France by the secret treaty of San Ildefonso occurred. Attention is directed to the colored area of the map over that part of the original Louisiana as proclaimed by La Salle, which lies south of latitude 31° and east of the Mis- sissippi River. Twenty years after the treaty of Paris of Febru- ary 10, 1763, in the settlement of boundaries at the close of the Revolutionary War, the United States took over from Great Britain all that part of the original Louisiana ceded to the latter by France in 1763, viz., the territory of Louisiana east of the Mis- sis.sippi River and north of latitude 31° N. At this time also, September 3, 1783, owing to Spanish claims and aggression. Great Britain ceded back to Spain, without boundary delimitations, the territory south of latitude 31° and east of the Mississippi River, which the former had received, also without boundary delimita- tions, through the definite treaty of 1763. It should be remem- bered here that that part of this territory shaded in agreement with the rest of the area called “Louisiana” formed a part of the original territory of Louisiana proclaimed by La Salle and ceded by treaty stipulation to Spain in 1762. The Government and people of the United States, who, in 1783, came into possession of that part of the original Louisiana ceded by France to Great Britain, had no reason to question the validity of the cession of 1763 by France, since Spain had indorsed it and approved it. James Madison, Secretary of State, in a letter to Robert Livingston, minister to France, of date March 31, 1803^, says of this cession : Spain might not unfairly be considered as ceding back to France what Prance had ceded to her, inasmuch as the cession of it to Great Britain was made for the benefit of Spain, to whom, on that account. Cuba was restored. The effect was precisely the same as if France had. in form, made the cession to Spain and Spain had assigned it over to Great I 1 '1 t i Vol. 2 of American State Papers, Foreign Relations, p. 577. ht 'f- *- V*’ a: i(fw pbitivr.l )\\} i>rifj Jo Un7 lom T-: l4itc>,r* MK} Iht^A avrijZ if\\ti <(p<j^fhrM 4»^jj U« ct ) h^mfdr f>g^ <f‘Wv^.*;. «4i I •: t'Vt 'J*rrf4,^fffj'l<. ■' »*, J>bi;iv.’fs( Vi K tv •■ 1 ^0, it ;'*’ \\ '> /( •! ■ f li^- ) tij ^ *bi (■,«i n^rl 'Viify 15^t»;f V0>y^^ VStmt 9tti ’\\ .j fjiw'kjdo !>m«.

' 16 SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY Britain; and the cession may the more aptly be considered as passing through Spain, as Spain herself was a party to the treaty by which it was conveyed to Great Britain. Spain obtained title from France to “the whole of Louisiana” in 1762, and was therefore in position to cede the Gulf coast to Great Britain in 1763. There was nothing peculiar in the retro- cession of this tract by Great Britain to Spain in 1783 ; nothing ap- parent to justify the contention of Spain, following the retro- cession to France in 1800 of “the colony or province of Louisiana with the same extent it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it,” that this territory belonged to and formed a part of her original possessions in Florida. By secret treaty, known as the “Treaty of San Ildefonso,” of October 1, 1800, Spain retroceded to France “the colony or prov- ince of Louisiana with the same extent it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it had wTen France possessed it, and such as it should be after the treaty subsequently entered into between Spain and the other states.” By this treaty France again came into possession, so far as Spanish interests were concerned, of the original territory of Louisiana; but the same was, of course, shorn of the large area east of the Mississippi River and north of latitude 31°, which for 17 years past had been a part of the United States. This retroceded Louisiana undoubtedly embraced that portion of the original territory which lies south of latitude 31° and east of the Mississippi River, whatever may have been its extent. The wording of the treaty of San Ildefonso precludes any other view than that of retrocession, and the United States so held and understood it, as shown by acts of sovereignty here- inafter noted. TERRITORY OF LOUISIANA, 1803-1819 (MAP NO. 4). Map No. 4 shows the area of the territory of Louisiana as pur- chased from France in 1803. It will be noted that no change in the boundary of that part west of Mississippi River has occurred since 1762, but that the area of the tract along the Gulf coast east of the river is materially reduced. April 30, 1803, France ceded to the United States the territory of Louisiana “with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it, and such as it should be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other States,” using the identical language employed in the cession to France by Spain in 1800, but adding: “The French Republic has an iricontestible title to the domain and to the possession of said territory.” The confinement of American claims, under the treaty of 1803, to the area west of the Perdido River was doubtless due to the fact of early Spanish settlement at Pensacola Ray and at Fort St. Alarks, on the Appalachee River, and to the common misunderstanding of the real rights of the United States to all of the territory south of latitude 31°, which formed a part of the original Louisiana proclaimed by La Salle. SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY 17 jj ! n ft^UOO TQM AS *^0 YnovS^^ :iM08 18 SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY The first settlements in this territory were made by colonists in 1699, but 17 years after La Salle’s proclamation, and there can be no shadow of doubt that these settlements were made for the purpose of occupying- and exploiting the vast domain added to France under the name “Louisiana” through the courage and energy of the great explorer. The real meaning and significance of La Salle’s claim to the eastern Gulf coast as far as Palm River seems to have been overlooked, but this can not be said of that portion between the Perdido River and the Mississippi River. While Spanish diplomacy was undoubtedly aimed at retaining this territory at the time of the retrocession to France, in 1800, notwithstanding the unequivocal wording of the treaty of San Ildefonso to the contrary, the Government of the United States refused to accept any such boundary delimitation in 1803. February 24, 1804, Congress passed an act for laying and col- lecting duties in this territory, and on March 26 the district was added to the new Territory of Orleans. In October, 1810, the President, by proclamation, directed the governor of Orleans Territory to take possession of the territory. April 14, 1812, a part of these lands was annexed to Louisiana territory, and one month later the remainder, lying between the Pearl and Perdido Rivers, was annexed to the territory of Mississippi. March 3, 1817, Congress divided this tract, giving approximately half of it to the Territory of Alabama. Both Mississippi and Alabama came into the Union before the treaty with Spain for Florida was ratified, Mississippi the year before the treaty was negotiated and Alabama the same year, but two years before ratification. During this period, also, the United States made a census of the population of the district. These citations are offered for the purpose of showing that this Government, in its sovereign capac- tiy and through both its lawmaking and executive branches, had settled and finally disposed of all questions of ownership of the territory between the Mississippi and Perdido I^ivers and south of latitude 31° which were raised by Spain after the purchase from France in 1803, and prior to the Florida treaty of 1819. The fact that the United States Supreme Court in many cases has supported the political acts of the Government relating to this territory is of passing interest. These decisions, however, can have no direct bearing upon questions of title affecting the ler- litory in the aggregate. TERRITORY OF LOUISIANA, 1819-1904 (MAP NO. 5). Map No. 5 shows the extent of the “Louisiana Purchase” after its boundaries of 1803 had been modified through the treaty with Spain ceding Florida to the United states and fixing the boundary between the United States and Spanish possessions west of the Mississippi River in 1819. It is of interest because the American gains and losses by that treaty are shown and because Spain was satisfied to fix her most northern boundary west of the Rocky Mountains at the parallel of 42° north.

It will be noted that two small tracts, marked “A,” not forming a part of La Salle’s Louisiana, became a pari of the United States, and that two tracts, marked “B,” of much larger area shown upon the map, which are a part of the Mis- sissippi watershed and were therefore a part of La Sallees Lou- isiana, were surrendered to Spain in exchange. SUMMARY. French title to the territory called “Louisiana” in the Missis- sippi Valley had its origin and was based upon the discovery and proclamation of La Salle, April 9, 1682. The title “Louisiana,” as proclaimed by La Salle, may not properly be applied to other and doubtful P'rench possessions in America, and sincej French ownership of territory beyond the watershed line at the time of the purchase is a matter of grave doubt and can not be established. La Salle’s “Louisiana” may not properly include such alleged possessions. The Spanish territory directly drained into the Pacific Ocean, or the territory drained into Hudson Bay, never belonged to France by virtue of La Salle’s discovery and proclamation of 1682, when the limits of Louisiana were defined and title to these districts was neither offered nor transferred by France to the United States in the sale of 1803. 2. French title to Gulf territory from the Mississippi River to Palm River, on the Gulf coast of Florida, as a part of original Louisiana, was as good as French title to the Mississippi Valley, for both districts came under the French flag at the same time | and for the same reason, viz., the discoveries of La Salle and his | proclamation based thereon, at the mouth of the Mississippi ' River, April 9, 1682. It therefore follows that subsequent ces- sions of “the whole territory known under the name of Louisi- ana,” or of “the colony or province of Louisiana, with the same extent . . . that it had when France possessed it,” con- veyed title to this territory just as surely as they conveyed title to territory drained by the Mississippi River and its tributaries, and the title thus conveyed was just as good. 3. The Government of the United States acted strictly within its treaty rights when, following the purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803, it occupied the territory between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, took a census of the people, levied and col- lected taxes, and finally, prior to the ratification of the purchase of Florida, divided the tract into three separate parcels and added | one each to the States of Louisiana, ^lississippi, and Alabama. I Map No. 4, therefore, properly exhibits the outboundaries of the | Louisiana purchased from France in 1803, and asserted by the I United States thereafter, and Map No. 5 shows the modifications I of that boundary west of the Mississippi River agreed to in the | treaty with Spain in 1819.

The Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce and Labor, by letters of February 2, 1912, and February 10, 1912, respectively, formally accepted these boundaries and the areas thereby de- termined for use in all publications of the several bureaus of each department.^ The north and east boundaries of the Texas ter- ritory are identical with those of the Texas Republic which con- formed to the compromise boundary between Spain and the United States, established by treaty of 1819. The west boundary of the Texas annexation conforms to the former western bound- ary of the Texas Republic. The common boundary along the forty- .sccond parallel, between the Mexican cession and the Oregon territory, is the line also fixed by the treaty with Spain of 1819. The eastern boundary of the Oregon territory conforms to the western boundary of the Louisiana of La Salle and the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the same being the watershed between the Mis- sissippi River drainage and the drainage toward the Pacific Ocean.

Washington, March 31. — The final act of more than fifty years’ effort to bring the Danish West Indies under the American flag was completed with formal ceremonies at the State Department today when Danish Minister Brun was handed a Treasury warrant for $25,000,000, the purchase price, and Wireless messages were sent to the American and Danish authorities at the islands to lower the Danish flag and raise the Stars and Stripes. “By giving you this warrant.” Secretary Lansing said as he handed the paper to the Minister, “I will save you the trouble of transporting forty- eight tons of gold. The value of this paper in coin would be equivalent to that weight.” These islands contain 138 square miles of territory. LOWEST AND HIGHEST STATES. Delaware is Lowest and Colorado is Highest. Almost everybody know^s which is the smallest and which is the largest state In the Union, but how many know which is the lowest and which is the highest? According to the measurements and calculations made by the United States Geological Survey, Delaware is the lo'.vest State, its elevation above sea level averaging only sixty feet. Colorado is the high- est, averaging 3,800 feet above the sea, wdiile Wyoming is a close second, only 100 feet lower than Colorado. In minimum elevation Florida and Louisiana dispute for second place after Delaware, their average elevation being, for each, 100 feet. Taking the United States as a whole, our country lies slightly above the average elevation of the land of the globe. THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE. Because of the prevailing opinion that Thomas Jefferson, made the Louisiana Purchase, I felt like a note explantary of that transaction would greatly aid in placing the matter properly before the readers of these pages. In 1802, it became known to the inhabitants of the Mississippi Val- ley that Louisiana had been retroceded to France, and the relations be- Iw’ceu France and the United States at that time were very much strained, through the treatment of the embassy sent in 1797 to adjust the differ- ances between the tw'o nations. Indignation meetings among those living along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, made appeals to the Congress to • purchase the Islands of New Orleans so as to give them an outlet to the gulf of Mexico wdth their produce. This resulted in a resolution by the congress authorizing the president to call out 50,000 militia and take pos- session of New Orleans, but a substitute was adopted appropriating $2,- 000,000 for the purchase of New Orleans, and on January 10, 1803, James Monroe was sent as minister to France, Robert R. Livingston was already our accredited minister at that court, and the two wmre to make the very best effort possible to purchase New Orleans, Monroe on reaching Paris found negotiations had already been begun by Mr. Livingston for the pur- chase of Orleans. The commissioners were completely surprised to receive a counter proposition from Napoleon’s representative, Barbe-INIar- bois, in which he offered to sell all the Fronch possessions in America. Our ministers clo.sed a deal for all of the Louisiana territory for $15,000,- 000. A treaty to *hat effect was signed by all the contracting parties on the 30th day of April, 1803, and Thomas Jefferson never knew anything about it until Mr. Monroe reached Washington with the treaty on the 14th day of July. The treaty wms confirmed by the Senate of the United States October 19, 1803. and the title to the w'hole of the Louisiana territory passed to the United States. THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION. Justice demands that President Jefferson be given credit for the above expedition.

He communicated with the American Phil- osophical society, suggesting that the services of a suitable person be secured to \\isit the Missouri river, thence cross the Rocky Mountains and proceed as far as the sea; he expressed the hope to the sofciety that a subscription might be raised to aid such an object. Capt. Meriweather Lewis, a captain in the regular Army, and at that time serving in Virginia, heard of this proposition of Mr. Jefferson, and to him offered to undertake such a Journey. No means at hand, it was not at that time undertaken. When, however, Mr. Jefferson became president, the project was still uppermost in his mind, and in a message addressed to Congress, January 18, 1803, he recommended that an expedition be authorized at government expense for the purpose mentioned. Congress responded with a generous appropriation and a company was selected under the personal supervision of the president. The early request of Capt. Lewis, who had been selected by President Jefferson as his private secretary, was now remembered, and thus his name with that of Captain Clark is inseparably connected with this world-renowned expedition. Which adds to the fame of President Jefferson. MEXICO. (By General George F. Alford.) A few words about ancient Mexico (of which Texas was a part), the “land of the Montezumas” of sunshine and flowers, and music; of rosy dimpled cheeked, laughing-eyed, joyous senoritas; that beautiful far-away home of profound repose and soft indolence and dreamy solitude, where life is one long slumberless Sabbath; tne climate one endless balmy, de- licious summer day — where the dainty maidens, in whose bright eyes mirth and midnight and mischief hold their high court, are walking poems and realistic visions, and whose fascinations are as irresistible as the charms of Five when she wooed and won our first father to his downfall. No alien land in all the wide world has such a resistless charm for me, no other land could so beseechingly haunt me, sleeping and waking, through half a liferime as that has done. Other things leave me with a nameless void and an aching heart, but that abides forever. Other things were as effervescent as breath of morning, but that remains changeless as the eternal hills. For me its balmy airs are forever blow- ing, soft as the fragrant breezes wafted from the “garden of Hesperides,” delicious as the odorous zephyrs from the shores of “Araby the blessed.” Its summer seas flash unceasingly in the glad, bright sunlight, and I see its garland crags, its plumy palms, its distant snow-capped summits float- ing like white islands above the fleecy cloud tops. I feel the spirit of its woodland solitudes and in my eager ears linger the gentle murmur of its laughing brooks; in my nostrils lives the welcome breafli of fra- grant flowers that perished thirty years ago. In my memory dwells unbroken, a living presence, the charming reminiscence of the quaintest land and the most unique people this earth has ever known. How I wish that I were a painter or a poet that I might perpetuate in living colors or embalm by writers’ magic art the matchlessness and imperishable beauties which have gladdened my eyes; the strains of seraphic music ^’hich my ears have caught, more delicious than the matin lays of song birds lu the early blushing I\\lay morning, when they soar with rever- berating melodies in glad bright sunlight; soft, tender, sacred inspira- *ions which soften my heart, made almost callous by tho adamantine caress of cold and selfish associations; the heavenly visions which swell vt ./o I rrnuoo rtmAt •to rmytim l^woa K ffc4 ‘ n yt^9it^ ff^v^ io i^ai?rfaii/irr « fir^ltl jijTi 9ftj<wj 7U0 Id hi/« \" «L^#1( 1_ ^ M' _ .^L ^ .

TEXAS. A map of North America, with the West India Islands, was published In London, February, 1777. It was laid down according to the latest sur- veys, and corrected for the original materials of Governor Pownall, mem- ber of parliament. On the region between our north-eastern boundary and Colorado, as laid down on that map, the name Ticas is found in capital letters. It has been assumed that Ticas is the same as the present word Texas. The history of the discovery of Texas has been in dispute. It Is not my mission here to discuss the various claims to its discovery or ownership. THE INTRODUCTION OF COTTON IN THE UNITED STATES. The armed conflict by which Texas cast off the yoke of Mexican tyranny and established a separate Anglo-American republic re-enacted in mod- ern times and in the Western world events and scenes that, occurring In ancient Greece, rendered the name of Hellas glorious and established wells of patriotic inspiration from which after ages have drawn copious draughts.

Do you think of the days, of our boyhood days, the flowers, the forests and streams; The hoot of the owl and coyote’s howl, disturbing our boyhood dreams; The buds and the bees and the traps ’mong the trees, the nuts and the squirrels and quails? Do we drink in the joys, same as when we were boys, when the farm fences all were of rails? We had plenty to eat and had a few sheep, and v/e shared ’em in May or in June; And ma knit, spun and wove and made all of our clothes with spinnin’ wlieel and the loom. Everybody was “pore,” a string latch to the door, home-made beds, tables and chairs; But we had lots of fun, everything but the “mun,” and we didn’t put on any airs. In our double log home, built on land of our own, cost six bits an acre or more. With a hall in between, we were happy and green, and husky and hearty and “pore.” Our chimney was squatty and was rough and was rocky — got most of ’em out of the yard; We kids carried water, made mud for the mortar, and when it was dry it was bard. Our fireplace was dandy, it was wide and was handy, and besides bein’ wide it was deep; In the Evch where it crooks, pa fixt ma some hooks, where she cooked nearly all of the meat. We had wild turkey and deer nearly all of the year, and wild honey we got from the bees: They got it from wild flowers — and the flowers were ours — and had stored it away in trees. Our “harlh,” too, was rock from the ground to the top, and I’ve often seen mammy o-makin’. Bread for the ovens, fire under, above ’em, preparin’ potatoes for bakin’. The potatoes made candy and the bread it was dandy, and our cost nothin’ a-tull. Aside from wild game we had hogs on the range, gettin’ fat on the mast in the fall.

There were no doctors then, so pa said except when, we were sick we must let it alone; And I heard mammy say, dad was sick every day until every bit of it was gone.

But gone are the joys we had when we were boys; still a boy has fun now, never fear. May have more with his wheel or his automobile than we had with the turkey and deer.

ELLIS P. BEAN. The late Judge John H. Reagan said: ‘T became acquainted with Peter E. Bean, who in Yokum’s History and other publica- tions, is called Ellis P. Bean, in the summer of 1839, at his home in what was then Nacogdoches county, but now Cherokee. county, near where the town of Alto now stands. I knew him well until he left Texas for the Republic of Mexico. “Soon after I became acquainted with Colonel Bean, he showed me his autobiography and we read it together; a fair sized volume In manuscript. He requested me to edit and publish it. This I was in no condition to do.” Now, prior to 1839, Cherokee county was a part of the Chero- kee Nation, so called because the Cherokee Indians held dominion over it for many years and because it embraced about one-third of Van Zandt county. I deem it proper to give space to one of the most unique characters that ever visited Texas in all its days of romance and tragedy. Because of Bean’s dual life, as is indicated by Judge Reagan, in his dual name it is hard to give a continued and unin- terrupted story of him and so he may be robbed of some of his daring exploits in the following narration, which must neces- sarily be incomplete. Philip Nolan, by birth or parentage, a son of the Emerald Isle who for a time lived about Frankfort, Kentucky, drifted to New Orleans and being something of a polished adventurer, heard stories of the abundance of wild horses in Texas. He made a trade with the Baron de Corondelet, for whom one of the streets in New Orleans is named and who was then Governor of New Orleans, to deliver to him in New Orleans, a numiber of horses, 01, condition that he be given passports to Texas for that purpose. \\V ith tnis, he repaired to San Antonio de Bexar, where he made the acquaintance of Don Manuel Munoz, Governor of Texas, and through ?ne kind offices of that officer was enabled to procure a permit to obtain the horses in Texas and San Tander. He pro- cured a goodly number of horses and delivered them as per con- tract and then repaired to Natchez, Mississippi, The transac- tion was a remunerative one and not long thereafter another con- tract of like character was also carried out with like results. No- lan repaired again to Natchez and that time m.arried the belle of the town and built him a home. About the latter part of 1800, Nolan made a third contract for furnishing an installment of horses to the governor of New Orleans and set about recruiting a small army of some thirty-four or five Americans, some six or ‘4: \\‘’i. ^4 A t'T ■£ ■''i > ,.;.

Among them was Ellis P. Bean, the subject of thi; | sketch. In the meantime a change of officers resulted in an order ] for the arrest of Nolan and his associates, who had crossed thf 1 Mississippi river at Nogales (Walnuts), about six miles from the I Washita Post. Nolan, for a time, was detained by a party o: | militiamen, but was released and went forward on his mission | Lieutenant Musquiz, a Spanish officer, at Nacogdoches, was or- j dered to follow and arrest Nolan. I ^ Nolan and his associates reached Texas, crossed the Trinity | and advanced into the vast prairie between that stream and the | Brazos, where they found an abundance of wild horses and for i nine days lived on the flesh of these animals, which they cooked ] over fires made out of buffalo dung. Journeying on west they | reached the Brazos, where they found plenty of deer and elk and 1 some buffalo and innumerable wild horses. Here they built j an enclosure, caught and penned about three hundred mustangs. ^ While lolling around their camp fires they were visited by a j large lodge of Comanche Indians, with whom they became quite i companionable and with them visited their village on the south | fork of Red River, where they found their chief, Necoroco, and ] several other tribes who visited their lodge while Nolan and his \\ band were there. Nolan returned to his stockade, accompanied \\ by an escort of the wild tribe, who managed to steal eleven head '] of domesticated saddle horses of Nolan’s band — in fact all they | had that were suitable for use in capturing mustangs. I Nolan’s company at that time consisted of Captain Nolan, .j Lieutenant Ellis P. Bean, ten other Americans, five Spaniards i and one negro. Bereft of their horses in that vast wilderness. 1 they could do nothing. In this predicament. Captain Nolan j called for volunteers to pursue the thieves, and Lieutenant Ellis | P. Bean, Robert Ashley, Joseph Reed, David Faro, and Ceasar, i the negro, volunteered to go after them. After nine days march- | ing, on foot, they found four of their horses in care of as many 1 Indian men and some women; the other horses, the Indians said. \\ had been taken on a buflfalo hunt by eight of their number, and I that they would return that evening; that the one who had stolen \\ the horses was a one-eyed Indian, whom they would know from | that description. In the evening the Indians cam.e with an \\ abundance of buffalo meat and the horses. The Nolan band | tied the one-eyed Indian thief and guarded him until morning. ^ T’ney then took from him enough provisions to last them on their 5 trip home, which required four days travel. They then set j about preparing for their leave for New Orleans. I Lieutenant Muznuiz surrounded their camp early on the morn- 1 ing of March 21, 1801, and relating the occurrence says: “When I j arrived at the wooden intrenchment at sunrise, having divided 1 my force into three bodies, one commanded by me and carrying j a four pounder, I marched on Nolan’s intrenchment.

SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY 33 rived within about thirty paces from it, ten men sallied forth from the intrenchment, unarmed; among them was Nolan, who said in a loud voice, “Do not approach, because one or the other will be killed.’’ Noticing that the men who accompanied Nolan were foreigners, I ordered Mr. William Barr, an Irishman who had joined my command as interpreter, to speak to them in Eng- lish and say to them that I had come for the purpose of arresting them, and that I expected them to surrender in the name of the king. Nolan had a brief conversation with Barr, and the latter informed me that Nolan and his men were determined to fight. Nolan re-entered his intrenchment, followed by his men and I observed that two Mexicans, Juan Jose Martinez and Vicanta Lara, escaped from the rear of said intrenchment. Soon after these Mexicans joined us, stating that they had brought Nolan’s carbine, which they handed to me. At daybreak Nolan and his men commenced firing. The fight lasted until 9 o'clock a. m. when Nolan was killed by a cannonball and his men surren- dered. They were out of ammunition. Nolan’s force at the time was composed of fourteen Americans, one Creole, of Lou- isiana, seven Spaniards or Mexicans and two negro slaves. Nolan had three men wounded and several horses killed. His men had long beards. “After their surrender, I learned that they had left Natchez with supplies for two months and had been in the woods and prairies of Texas over seven months, living on horse meat. “Nolan’s negroes asked permission to bury their master, which I granted after causing his ears to be cut off, in order to send them to the governor of Texas.” I have seen several accounts as to where Philip Nolan was sup- posed to have been killed, all differing. The one most probable is on Nolan’s river in Johnson county^j^ The following compose a list of those who were with Nolan before he was killed : Stephen Richards, Pennsylvania, aged .20 years; Simon McCoy, Pennsylvania, aged 25 years; Joseph Wal- ters, Virginia, aged 26 years; Joseph Reed, Pennsylvania, aged 26 years; William Danlin, Pennsylvania, aged 27 years; Solomon Cooly, Kentucky, aged 25 years; Ellis P. Bean, North Carolina, aged 22 years; Charles King, Maryland, aged 27 years; Joel J. Pierce, North Carolina, aged 22 years; Thomas House, Vir- ginia, aged 27 years ; Ephriam Blackburn, Maryland, aged 35 years; David Eero, New York, aged 24 years; Vincente Lara, Mexico, aged 38 years; Juan Jesus Martinez, Mexico, aged 21 years; Jose Jusus Santos, Mexico, aged 21 years; Lorezo Hino- jose, Mexico, aged 34 years; Jos Barbon, Mexico, aged 20 years; Lucian Garcia, aged 42 years; Juan Bautita and Robert, negro slaves and Refugio de la Garza, Mexico aged 30 years. The following, although belonging to Nolan’s command, escaped from prison at Nacogdoches soon after the surrender; Robert Ashley, South Carolina, aged 38; John House, Virginia, aged 21 and Michael Moore, Ireland, aged 25. t I rxHlJQO >CAV TO 3U0U3 £toJ krjih»> <t/>m my ,ti rqv-j? 853^. >{iiLii,jwo«>a fiilww i««-„ bs(»,n«<jtoo:.3i dH'/?- nstii 9<j^/Jrtj n,f to;>tfi trf ,’m^:>%!«ftF WlilfwwiKiaj S^^wwf^ci sjo'r^^yq 9(1j.,9«3 5^^ ( .rciir piytlf'orVrS'fifli 5i;t ^ *’**,*' '■*■'*15 JjUjiisviroa*- }»a«(: e ' bj^rf .fticiciV^ j % ■’ • I'l”^ ., j,t!hSa ,.f «# ;:- ..^n- «J«. > -teilaj »34VjrfK>Jfi-»v!.i| bna bafem/ow asrarwi* b«< , -IS? ?** '<»wj '^;h^<^,‘ diiw .xxuah li.rf) -nu^ hi noktimaa bsjJ*. .,oW *‘«iloJf- ’ “r • ^ ■*s»» « « •< „•>“ * »SiirS£i*fiSSi i . ... i.*' ' ^ir^f . . -, fcis., ..^.ort-r .»*,«Kff*S<T47,“ri frr ua tt sdT' rnw/ ,ow»i^'.AWug g«8«it wcl 34 SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY Hereafter, the story is given by Bean in his autobiography, which is somewhat like the fish story in which Jonah and the gourd vine figured and the reader may give all the credit it is entitled to Mr. Bean: “The command surrendered on the 22nd of March, 1801, under an agree- ment that it should be escorted to the frontier and allowed to return to the United States. On their part the prisoners promised to never enter Texas again. They were then taken to Nacogdoches. After remaining about a month in that place, they were manacled and marched to San Antonio and there imprisoned for three months. They were then con- ducted to San Louis Potosi, where they spent sixteen months in prison. During that time Bean and Charles King made shoes and earned enough money to buy clothing. The prisoners were taken to Chihuahua and there were tried by the Spanish authorities as invaders. Don Juan Jose Ruis de Bustamante, was pro’secuting attorney for the government and Don Pedro Ramos de Vere, counsel for the defendants. Judge Galindo do Navarro, who tried the case, on January 23. 1804, ordered the release of the prisoners, but as General Memesses Salcedo, commanding the Prov- inces objected, they were detained. The proceedings had in the trial were sent to the King of Spain, and he. by royal decree, dated at El Pard*>, February 23, 1807, ordered the authorities to hang one out of every five of the prisoners and condemn the others to ten years’ labor. Simon McCoy, Stephen Richards and Thomas House, who were not within the intrenchments and offered no resistence at the time of the attack, were not to draw lots. Those who were to draw lots were, Lucian Garicano, Jonah Walters, Solomon Cooly, Ellis P. Bean, Joseph Reed, Charles King, Joseph Pierce. Ephriam Blackburn and David Fero. Judge Galindo’s re- moval from office was decreed but his death had removed him from the cares of all earthly responsibility before the king’s decree reached Mexico. When the king decreed that one out of every live of the Nolan prisoners, be executed, he was under the impression that the ten prisoners, as above v/cre alive; but as one of them. Joseph Pierce, had died, the new judge de- cided that one of the nine should suffer the penalty of death and this opinion was approved by General Salcedo. In the town of Chihuahua, (m the 9th day of the month of November. 1807. in compliance with the de- cree of his majesty, the king of Spain, transmitted to the commanding general of these provinces with a royal order of the 23rd day of February of said year, Don Antonio Garcia de Tejado, adjutant inspector of the in- ternal provinces of New Sapin, proceeding to the barracks of said town, together with Don Pedro Rames de Vera, counsel for the foreigners, who invaded the country under Philip Nolan and Don Jose Diaz de Bustamenta, prosecuting attorney and having caused the nine prisoners confined in said barracks to assemble in a room in order to draw lots, so that one of them might be executed. After they knelt I read the decree of his maj- esty, the king. The prisoners, having heard the same, agreed to throw dice and that the oldest of them should throw first and that the one who threw the lowest number should bo hanged. This agreement being made, a drum, a crystal tumbler and two dice were brought and I ordered the prisoners to kneel before the drum blindfolded. Ephriam Blackburn being the oldest among the prisoners first took the glass The throwir ' was as follows: Ephriam Blackburn 3 and 1. making 4; Luciano Garcl 3 and 4, making 7; Joseph Reed. 6 and r>. making 11; David Fero, 5 and 3, making 8; Solomon Cooly 6 and 5. making 11; Jonah Walters 6 and 1, making 7; Charles King, 4 and 3, making 7; Ellis P. Bean, 4 and 1, making 6; William Danlin, 5 and 2. making 7. Blackburn, after baptism by a priest, was hanged on Plaza de les Uranges, November 11, 1807.” Now, note that Blackl)urn was handed six years, seven months and twenty-two days after his capture. So you see how swift the courts were under Sjuinisli rule in Mexico, in those days. SOME HISTORY OF VAN ZANDT COUNTY 35 The surviving prisoners were next marched to the City of Mexico, where they nourished the hope that they would be re- leased, but instead they were marched to Acapulco, on the Pa- cific coast and imprisoned. Here Bean v/as separated from his companions and we will not take further notice of them, confin- ing our following remarks to Bean, as nearly as possible. The unfortunate Americans probably arrived at Acapulco in the spring of 1808. Bean was confined in a solitary prison with a guard pacing in front thereof hourly proclaiming “Centenally Al- Icrty.” He was given a scanty allowance of beef, bread and water; he amused himself with the companionship of a white lizard that he tamed and fed with flies. Being somewhat re- sourceful and longing for any change that might present itself, he managed to bring on a spell of enforced sickness to get a transfer to a hospital, in which he was successful, but his allow- ance of food was one chicken head per day. He was placed in irons and his legs were placed in stocks. At this treatment Bean complained and to which complaint the friar, who attended him, returned an angry, insolent answer and Bean landed a blow on his head, which sprawled the reverend father on the floor with an ugly wound for him to nurse. For this act Bean's head was also placed in stocks where he was allowed to remain for fifteen days when he was informed that he was to be re- turned to his cell. On his way to his former place of con- finement, he managed to elude his guards and reached some woods where he filed of! his irons with a piece of steel used by him in striking fire from a flint. After night he returned to Acapulco to procure some needed provisions and there met an English sailor. It was agreed between them that Bean should go on board a vessel at anchor in the harbor and lie concealed in a water cask. He succeeded in getting aboard the ship, but before it set sail he was betrayed and taken back to his cell, where he lingered another eighteen months in solitary confinement. One day, overhearing a conversation between a party of officers about blasting rock and professing to be an expert in this work, be offered his services, which were accepted and an opportunity soon presented itself and he again made his escape. Wending bis way north along the coast, he was retaken, carried back and chained to a gigantic mulatto criminal, who was instructed to wreak his vengeance on him whenever he so desired. His new companion showing signs of a belligerent spirit. Bean knocked b^m down and pelted him until he promised to be good and sub- ..’lissive before he would let him up. The mulatto filed a plea of divorcement from Bean with the governing authorities if by such separation he would forfeit one year remission of his sen- tence. They were accordingly separated much to the delight of t.ie mulatto and to Bean’s mutual satisfaction. Bean was re- manded to his cell and his former companion, the lizard. While thus confined, a revolution spread over the Mexican states, including Acapulco against Spain. The prisons were 1954219 To *<jr> rirfi <*>/ it'^ifi . ’cur ^-j hfiii'W t7/)fj T\\^v! aT-»;w3i7<; 3#iV .^Ht (i futTf) h&ffij r.^i'^;-. .*> a'Ai ^ • V’'. r!*i. /.•': Ikyndt^d •! i«(:>.{ ,., .

He assured a Spanish officer that he would gladly fight for the king if given his liberty to do so and a gun. For this purpose and under his promise he was released and given a gun and a sabre. He was loyal to the king about one fortnight.! awaiting an opportunity to join the republican forces under] Morelos, taking with him a large number of the royalist soldiers] and much munitions of war. According to his account he had i planned the affair with Morelos and marched his command into a preconcerted trap. He so ingratiated himself into the confi- dence of Morelos that upon leaving Acapulco with his army, he placed Bean in command of the besieging forces encompassing that place. About the close of the year 1812, Bean had the satisfaction of taking the town and its garrison by force of arms and making prisoner of the Governor of the Castle who had been his master in captivity. Remember this, about eleven years since he struck his colors and surrendered on Nolan’s River in Texas, as he said, under promise of being conducted out of Texas and released. Bean went on succeeding in one way and another; met and married Senorita Anna Grothas, owner of the rich hacienda of Benderillas, near Jalapa, between Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico. In 1814 he was dispatched by General Morelos on a mission to the United States, to procure aid for the patriot cause in Mexico. At the port of Nautla, on the gulf coast above Vera Cruz, he boarded one of Lafitte’s vessels. Captain Dominic, master. He informed Dorninic of his mission and was landed on the island of Barrataria, below New Orleans, where lie met Lafitte, who con- ducted him by a short route to New Orleans. There he found General Jackson, who being an old friend of his family, invited him to share in the glories of the 8th of January. He embraced the offer and fought side by side with Lafitte with his accustomed gallantry. After the battle of New Orleans, Lafitte furnished him transportation to Nautla for himself and his munitions of war for the patriot army of Mexico. Bean worked himself up to where he held a high commission in the patriot army of Mexico before the close of the revolution in 1821, when Morelos won for the IVfexican people their independence of the Spanish kingdom. After the death of Morelos, and the conciliatory jiropositions of Apodica, the fires of the Mexican revolution had so far expired that Bean left the country and visited his native State. He reached the residence of his half brother. Captain William Shaw, in White County, Tennessee, in the spring of 1818. After re- maining here sometime, he formed a matrimonial alliance with a daughter of Isaac !Midkiff. He then emigrated with his family and father-in-law to Smackover Creek, in Arkansas. Here they settled, without a neighbor within thirty miles of them, and com- menced raising stock. At the end of three years his father- in-law died.

He located himself at the Mound Prairie, the ancient town of Texas, and obtained from the g-overnment, for his services a grant for a league of land including his residence in Anderson County. At this place Bean resided quietly till the summer of 1825, when he set out for Mexico. He reached the capital on the 18th day of October, and remained there till the 21st of July, 1826. Here he met his old companions-in-arms, and possessed himself of a knowledge of the interesting events that had transpired in the country during the past seven years. For his services in the revolution he received, in addition to the grant of land before mentioned, the appointment of colonel in the permanent forces of the republic and as such was sent as Indian agent to the Cherokees and made his home as Judge Reagan said, about where the town of Alto now is. When the Texas revolution was commenced. Bean went to General Rusk and surrendered and was by him given a parole, which was duly obeyed during the struggle with Mexico, which culminated in the capture of La Presidente Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, at San Jacinto. Headright certificate 690 was granted to Peter E. Bean by the board of land commissioners of Nacogdoches county, Texas, for one league and labor of land, x\\pril 4, 1839, and recites that he arrived in Texas previous to the second day of May, 1835, as a married man and that he appeared before said board of land commissioners and made proof that he was entitled to said cer- tificate. This certificate was located in Kaufman county, on the waters of Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, and patent issued to Peter E. P>ean for said land. In July, 1842, he executed a deed to one-half of said grant to Helena Nelson, reciting that he and his grantee lived in Cherokee county, Texas. Witnesses to this title paper were J. i\\I. Bean and W. Y. Lacy. The remaining one-half passed by will to his heirs. Bean remained in Texas until about the time it was annexed to the United States, when he left via of New Orleans, for his former wife and home near Vera Cruz, iMexico. with whom he lived until his death, which occurred October 3, 1846. Bean raised a family of three children in Texas which he left on his departure for Mexico. I am not advised as to what be- came of his wife that he married in Tennessee. On the 11th day of i\\Iay, 1846, President Polk, in a proclamation to congress, declared that war existed between the United States and Alexico. On the 21st of September, 1846, General Taylor, of the United States army directed officers under his command to open hostilities on IMonterey, a city of importance in northeast Mexico, which, after much hard fighting surrendered to General d nylor’s command on September 25th. But I am not advised as to whether or not this information reached Ellis P. Bean before kis death. 1 YTMTOO TaKAJT %0 )S b90fe/bni t*»fi K«3 tffs buj$ V* fiah ►til ynim^ bm^K iilf M ktoj ,fj) ?^4Tv-.^f. U htoiigtJo fiwe»} la>t:irfR i|'rtv':.rH^nr ofiivi R airf r . ‘j .

WHEN KING BANDITI RULED. **This world is but a fleeting show. To vain delusions given; There* s not an honest man on earth And scarcely one in heaven** By the treaty of 1819, between the United States and Spain, the western boundary line of Louisiana Purchase was fixed to begin in the Gulf of Mexico off the mouth of the Sabine river and to run up that stream and north to the Red river, etc. Un- til the demarkation of the line, it was agreed by both parties to the treaty, that there should be a neutral strip between the west- ern line of the Louisiana Purchase and the eastern line of Spain’s possessions, not to be occupied by either of the parties to the contract, so that no trouble would ensue on account of the bound- ary line. The line was not demarked until 1841 and the neutral strip became the rendezvous of escaped convicts and others flee- ing from justice. After Mexico had thrown off the yoke of Spain, this agreement was renewed between the United States and that republic and the same was done as regarded Texas after it had severed connection with Mexico. These bandits knew no law, nor recognized any government, only as it suited their convenience. The following from Noah Smith wick will serve to show how things were run in the neutral strip. After giving a full account of the counterfeit,ing operations going on there he savs : Another swindling scheme that was being worked on a gigantic scale and which was productive of more lasting evil, it will be necessary to go back to 1829 to explain. Don Padillo came from Saltillo as commissioner of the land office to survey and make title to claims of bona fide settlers outside of the regular colonies, being provided with blanks for that purpose, on w'hich was stamped the seal of the Republic of Mexico, lacking only the specifications and signature of the commissioner to complete them. ... He was thrown into prison and his papers fell Into the hands of an unscrupulous gang, who at once proceeded to establish a land office of their own. Securing the services of an old Spaniard who had been a government clerk for years and was an expert penman, they had him forge the commissioner’s signature to the blanks, and thus equipped, set up business on a large scale, issuing floating certificates to any amount of land for an insignificant consideration. FRADULENT LAND SCRIPT ISSUED UNDER THE REPUBLIC. From a speech made in the United States Senate, on February 3, 1859, by Senator Sam Houston of Texas, we quote the follow- ing: M^UbKi^^niSirr w^ffB .^4' . fh7^ Mwnhm4 »fix Woe»-^ti4i:J,.r -qn;^ '/i’»««ft--»^H'«* flint sitfplMm-W'''^f^1^'> *<'»■ f,V:, f i) ■ «■>,» ?«■» >»hr ViW-iii^ tfvIlVn hl^ <v4 I'lNia nl 56 ^ii;, nwo^ TimU V -itilTVift bm;i *. • it6 ^ isNT ;hv»#tt|ii/flttc*S;dj iS- ■^f:<'.-^-itiiii^, qh b«4<r' J^Mifltwiiira trt«- ’■i Tff' ^ ffttmvfM i»i^‘^m>vjM:i»mj ntaoe ttKA.i. * ^ “ <i ■*■•* • ' R ' *S*I'Mff ^‘ ' - 'I' , /4ij6ri^->2 «iitfij^--i»»l!/fU Awij tit ^>^Vt \" ' *-■ ^;-;m ,;f“Jli.».V}!^l::- SOME HISTORY OP VAN ZANDT COUNTY 39 In the first place, it is necessary to explain the condition of the public domain of Texas at the period when the history of the appalling conspiracy referred to commenced. In the year 1837, by a general law of Texas, large donations of land were made to those who arrived and settled in the country previous to 1836, the date of her declaration of Independence. To married men one league of land and those who were unmarried, one-third of a league. Under this law, boards of land com- missioners were appointed, whose duty it was to investigate all claims on the government for headrights to lands, and to grant certificates to such persons as furnished the requisite proofs of their being entitled to the same. Many of these boards betrayed their trust and perpetrated frauds of the most alarming magnitude, assigning large numbers of cer- tificates to fictitious persons. These frauds came to be of the most open and notorious character; so much so that cases could be instanced vrhere to counties not numbering more than one hundred votero, nine hundred certificates were issued by the fraudulent action of these boards. The amount of these false certificates reached at last to such an over- whelming number that on the 5th day of February, 1840, a law was enacted, visiting the most severe penalties on the crimes of “making, or issuing, or being concerned in making of issuing, any such fraudulent or forged certificates,” and providing that “those who issued, or dealt in, or purchased, or located, or who were concerned in the issuing, or dealing in, or purchasing or locating” these fraudulent land certificates, should be punished by “thirty-nine lashes on the bare back, and by im- prisonment from three to twelve months, in the discretion of the judge.” A law was passed about the same time forbidding the survey of any land claimed under these certificates, until certified to be correct by other boards of commissioners appointed to examine into and detect the frauds by which the bounty of the republic had been abused and attempt made to despoil it of its domain. Now this bring-s us down to where Van Zandt county became involved by or with these fradulent land certificates. Kate Efnor, writing some years ago, says: In 1839, there reached the southern states, Mississippi espe"
