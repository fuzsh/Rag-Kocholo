They are my ancestors. The earliest ancestor I can 100% verify coming to Arkansas is a John L Brake (1841-1888) and his son John Henry Brake (1881-1947), my 2nd Great Grandfather. There are Brake's from NC and WV, and I am having trouble connecting either of them to the Brake's in AR. I believe John L came to AR from east Tennessee but that could also be wrong. I do know for a fact that John H was born in AR.

I grew up visiting the Brake family cemetery because my mother grew up in the home that Jesse Brake built next to the railroad tracks off of Brake Rd. Doe anyone have information about Jacob Jr. and Jacob Sr? There are a lot of discrepancies regarding potential connections to the VA/WV Brakes, especially around the so-called \"Morning\" Break who may or may not be connected to the Killbuck family. If this is something that you know more about, then I would greatly appreciate some insight.

Valentine <gamermom050715@gmail.com>\n\nKansas City, KS United States - Thursday, December 28, 2017 at 17:35:42 (EST) Looking for information on the Brake's of Georgia. John H Brake (my 2nd ggrandfather) is on a census record of 1850 as a 7yr old, he is listed with an 64 yr old lady named Mildred Thompson, Mary M Thompson who is 20, and James Reynolds who is 24. There is no indication of how they are related if at all. I am assuming he may have been taken in but it is possible that he is the child of one of the Thompson's? He was by all accounts a very talented man, serving in the Civil War and later as a Sheriff, he was murdered by a disgruntled neighbor. He married Miriah Louisa Clopton.\n\nRebecca Reynolds <reynolds0211@gmail.com>\n\nWilliamsburg, MI United States - Monday, April 17, 2017 at 13:45:38 (EDT) I am interested in any information concerning the BRAKES of the Bay of Islands, Newfoundland, Canada.

However, it seems that many researchers of the family have come to the conclusion that Naddie was from the German Neiswanger family, and was not a lenape Indian. John Jacob's grandson, Abram Brake, son of Jacob \"The Captive\" Brake seems to have been the main proponent of the Nyeswanan legend. The assumption is that he confused the surnames Nyeswanan and Neiswanger in a written statement. Understanding that the names are quite similar, it still seems to me to be a pretty remarkable error for a close relative to make. I suppose I would have to read the actual written text to make a conclusion on the subject. On another note, As of 1988 Jacob \"The Captive\" Brake's journal was said to be intact an Buckhannon, WV and may answer some of the questions we have about the Brake family. It may also provide insight to his life with the Shawnee tribe, which would be a joy to know. In doing research of my 'See' and 'Brake' ancestors, I have gained a wealth of knowledge on the history of West Virginia and America itself, and I am forever grateful.\n\nNoah See <Seelnoa@gmail.com.com>\n\nMathias, WV USA - Monday, January 19, 2015 at 11:52:58 (EST) I am writing to let you know that at present I am undertaking a one name study of the BRAKES name - whilst I know that in some instances our spellings i.e. with and without the 'e' are used in error there is certainly a group where the spelling with the 's' does not have any connection with the groups of those who spell it without the s. Therefore I would like you to be aware that I am willing to help any person who contacts you with regard to names spelt this way or any that you feel do not fit into your research group.

One of the biggest mistakes is the attempt to remove Ms. Neiswanger (J. Brake's 1st wife) from the records. They had six children before she was killed by the Indians. Let me ask this question to those who say she did not exist. If Mrs. Brake was killed by the Indians around 1758, (and we know that is true) how did she sign land transactions in 1762? Your own website shows that she signed papers in 1762 and I have copies of that information. The first Mrs. Brake was Ms. Neiswanger. Elizabeth Cooper was the 2nd wife. Catherine Stump was a neighbor and was the 3rd wife. Elizabeth only had one child that lived. His name was Abraham and Catherine had one child named Michael.\n\nElizabeth Brake <alphatype1559@yahoo.com>\n\nSt. Petersburg, F USA - Monday, March 11, 2013 at 01:27:25 (EDT) Have any additions been made to this page recently?\n\nAndrew Brake <meaneeman@hotmail.com>\n\nMartinsburg, WV USA - Monday, February 11, 2013 at 01:15:18 (EST) Wanted to respond to Heather Brake's post in February 2008 - Please contact me at the e-mail listed.

The earliest location known is Yetminster Dorset. There is a heritage listed \"Brake Cottage\" thereabouts. Ther are at least 2 other lines of Brake in England and the name,or modifications of it, are common in Germany, probably not related to the UK ones.

Both times the e-mail came back as \"undeliverable\". Anyway, here is what I said... Webmaster Dan Hyde forwarded the query you left on the Brake Family History web site to Linda Meyers, Sherri Brake, and me. All of us have been doing research on the Virginia line of Brakes for several years. We have a very extensive database of the Virginia Brakes and their descendants. There are a couple Henry Brakes in that database, but none married to Theophania. There are no Hallets in our database. Another group of Brakes settled in North Carolina about the same time our Brake ancestors were settling in Virginia. I have checked a very extensive database for the North Carolina Brakes and find no Henry Brake. That's the bad news. The better news is that on a hunch I checked the possibility of your Henry and Theophania belonging to a third line of Brakes, that one settling in Newfoundland. I found several Henry Brakes in Newfoundland in the right time period. but more importantly, perhaps, I found a Theophania Hallet listed in the directory of people living in Newfoundland in 1885 - 1886. You didn't give any dates, but that sounds about right. I also found many other Brakes and Hallets living in Newfoundland, including several who are still living there. When I said I \"found\" them, I am referring to doing a search on www.Ancestry.com. Don't quote me on this because I can't reference it at the moment, but I think the Newfoundland Brakes came from England. The Virginia and North Carolina Brakes emigrated from Germany. I have never heard of the name Theophania before, but I am pretty sure it isn't of German origin (which doesn't mean much because she could have come from just about any place in the worlk and hooked up with Henry in Newfoundland). Unless you have evidence that would lead you elsewhere, you might want to concentrate on Newfoundland as being the place of origin of your Henry and Theophania.\n\nPerry Brake <pudljumper1@comcast.net>\n\nTacoma, WA USA - Saturday, June 18, 2011 at 17:34:32 (EDT) Is anyone tracing Henry Brake & Theophania Hallet.

Take a look at my web page, www.perrybrake.com/brakelinie.html (linked at the top of the Brake Family History web site on which you posted your query). There I provide evidence that the family name in Germany was Brechtel, and them emigrated from southwestern Germany near the city of Karlsruhe. Although apparently well to do, they weren't nobility. The story about Lady Douglas of Scotland was invented by an unscrupulous German researcher and has no basis in truth.\n\nPerry Brake <pudljumper1@comcast.net>\n\nUniversity Place, WA USA - Wednesday, June 15, 2011 at 21:39:30 (EDT) For the persons who read David Evans Book about the Brakes.

They are MY great great grandparents. Both were alive during the 1870 census, living in Linn Co, MO, but both most likely died by 1873 (because they are NOT found on any further census records, either state or federal). Through several years of research, I've been able to piece together a great deal of info on George & Celia along with their SIX children, including son Jacob, MY great grandfather, but have been unable to locate their graves. I'm 100% certain this couple died in MO and are buried there (wrong info states they might have returned to VA/WV). Many other researchers have confused \"my George\" with another George who married Elizabeth (last name unknown), had at least 10 children, then apparently married Celia. I believe, beyond any doubt, that \"my George\" married only once, to Celia Reger (daughter of Abram Reger and Leah Ann Brake). As stated, only 6 children were born from this union: 5 in VA/WV and 1 in MO (that was son John). I doubt that graves for George & Celia will ever be located altho I feel perhaps they are buried in either Linn Co or Sullivan Co after, as I stated, doing mounds of research and \"putting 2 and 2 together\". To those of you who've also done research on this couple/line, I thank you for your contributions. Good luck with any further research.

They were my great great grandparents. Article continues and says that \"family reseacher CeeAnn Neuenschwander\" states: George & Celia Simon (s) died in MO according to REGER PAPERS LOCATED IN THE RARE BOOK ROOM, WESLAYAN COLLEGE\". I have been unable to locate any such papers. Does anyone have a clue regarding these papers??? I have traced my great great grandparents to Linn Co, MO during the 1870 census, then they vanish!! I do not believe, due to their advanced age, that they ever returned to VA. I've traced ALL their children & descendants but have found NO trace of their graves. Believe me when I say . . . I've done a great deal of research on this line, my direct line, as George & Celia's son, Jacob, was my great grandfather. NO TRACE HAS BEEN FOUND FOR GEORGE & CELIA!! The Simon surname, I've discovered, has been spelled MANY different ways, yet their fate still remains a huge mystery. If anyone knows of these \"Reger Papers\" . . . PLEASE contact me ASAP.

One of my cousins now has her family bible, with all our Gilley and Brumley family history recorded. The interesting thing is that the first page contains the following: John Reasons Brake, born 1827 George Wimberly Brake, born 1828 Robert Elisha Brake, born 1830 Sidney Ann Brake, born 1833 There is no known connection between our family lines and any Brake, Wimberly, or Reasons family line. Mary Gilley's parents were John Gilley and Lucinda Young. Her Gilley grandparents were Edward Gilley and Mary Collins, who were married in Lee Conty, WVA, in 1815. I believe Lucinda Young's parents were James Young and Ruth (Possibly Crabtree, not sure) Can you identify these Brakes, or explain why Mary Gilley's bible would have that information?

In addition to describing the involvement of BRAKEs in the Claypole Rebellion, Cartmell gives a firsthand account of a detachment of Rebel troops, led by Cartmell, being sent by Stonewall Jackson to gather information on a group of \"swamp dragons far up on the South Fork, on Brake's Run.\" The detachment was to pose as messengers sent by the federal government to inform the inhabitants of Brake's Run that they must go Moorefield and pledge their allegiance to the Union. A \"BRAKE,\" not further identified, and his son-in-law, \"POPE\", accompanied the imposters toward Moorefield, but at some point, the group from Brake's Run was forced to turn east and march across the Lost River to Jackson's HQ in the Shenandoah Valley where they were questioned by Jackson himself. They apparently escaped, but the narrative is not clear on how they did that. Does anybody know which BRAKE this might have been. Leonard, son of Michael and grandson of Jacob, Sr., was living there at the time, but he would have been in his 50s and might not have taken off on a 15 mile walk to Moorefield, nor survived the extended walk to the Shenandoah and still have had the energy to escape. Also, I am not aware that he had a daughter that married a Pope. Could it have been a son?
