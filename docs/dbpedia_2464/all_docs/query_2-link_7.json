Dillon staff writer The Plymouth-<strong>Canton</strong> schools are considering asking voters <strong>for</strong> more money this June to help the district make up <strong>for</strong> an expected revenue loss of J10 million. Trustees debated four options on Monday They are: • a renewal of 8 mills; • renewal of 8 mills and the waiving of the Headlee Amendment; • millage renewal and a new one- or two-year millage; or • millage renewal, waiver of the Headlee Amendment and a new one- or twoyear millage. BOARD MEMBERS didn't discuss how many mills would be sought, should a property tax increase question appear on the ballot. The board will resume its discussion on Feb 6. Talk of a millage increase comes on the heels of four millage requests rejected by voters during the last two years. Those defeats caused a financial dilemma <strong>for</strong> the schools, officials say. The last defeat led to $4 million in cutbacks in educational programs. Voter approval to waive the Headlee Amendment would allow the district to collect more property taxes. The amendment takes effect when the increase in assessed property values exceeds the rate of infla- tion. It mandates taxing units to roll back the lax rate to offset the difference. A waiver allows the unit to levy the full millage authorized by voters \"This is the third year we've survived on a maintenance budget,\" said Superintendent John Hoben. The district has reduced spending by $4 million, and the fund balance is at II .5 million, he said. \"That's well below what is safe,\" he said. The district is looking at losing more than $10 million next year, said Hoben. It will lose $3.3 million in state aid when it goes out of <strong>for</strong>mula, and another $7.6 million because of a tax rollback, he said.

Washtenaw, Oakland, Macomb and Monroe counties, he said. They range from people saying. \"I saw such and such a car ip my neighborhood\" to those who \"are actually naming people that might be involved,\" Boljesic said \"Some look more fruitful than others, but we have to investigate them all,\" he said. \"Just following up the leads is going to take several weeks.\" Police believe last week's incident is linked to a similar case reported in August. In that incident, a Westland woman was picked up in Dearborn and taken to the same cemetery <strong>Canton</strong> police have increased patrols near the cemetery. \"Any time somebody rapes once, they are capable of doing it more than once,\" said Boljesic.

PROJECTIONS SHOW state equalized valuation will increase by $259 million next year, he said Should that occur, a rollback of 4.78 mills would result in the $7 6 million loss. bi-<strong>for</strong>mula districts receive financial aid from the state. Districts go out of <strong>for</strong>mula, losing all state aid. when local property values and tax revenue exceed a set level \"We've kicked it around pretty hard. It comes back to what is the basic level of education this community wants, and what is it willing to pay? What I see is deterioration,\" said Hoben \"I feel anything less than the renewed millage and Headlee will result in reduced programs We need a one-year reprieve from Headlee I think things will ease out as we go out of <strong>for</strong>mula Right now we're in deep financial trouble in this school district. \"We have property values out there to protect that are dependent upon quality schools,\" the superintendent said. Realtors and homebuyers \"are picking up the message that there's trouble in Plymouth-<strong>Canton</strong> schools and that they may want to stay away from there.\" The renewal and a Headlee rollback would reap $5.7 million, enough to restore some program cuts, Hoben said Cuts have been made in staffing, athletics, the attendance office and other areas Officials tour Please turn to Page 2 recycling plant in Cali<strong>for</strong>nia By Diane Qale staff writer Two <strong>Canton</strong> officials were to return from Saiisalito. Calif , today after a two-day trip to inspect a trash recycling facility there. Supervisor Tom Yack and clerk Loren Bennett were scheduled to tour the Mann County Recycling Center built on a landfill Just north of San Francisco. They were to leave Tuesday afternoon The privately ran center is one of the largest recycling and material recovery plants in the country BEFORE BENNETT and Yack left <strong>for</strong> Cali<strong>for</strong>nia, a video tape depicting highlights of the recycling center circulated at the township hall. However. Bennett said seeing the video wouldn't take the place of making the trip because in addition to touring the center, they wanted to talk to area officials and the center owner Catherine Chown. an Ann Arborbased recycling consultant, said the Marin center is a \"state of the art\" facility and would be worthwhile touring There are other recycling facilities in various other places in the country including Minnesota and the East Coast The Mann center has been in operation longer than most recycling centers, and people there are helpful in showing visitors what they're doing, she said. The township officials were to make the trip with Mike Miller and Don Vilnus of Wayne Disposal, a local landfill company, which is seeking approval from <strong>Canton</strong> officials to build a landfill. <strong>Canton</strong> officials have balked at a landfill and Wayne Disposal la eeefcmg a special go-ahead <strong>for</strong> the <strong>Canton</strong> site from the Wayne County Implementation Committee, which is commissioned to deal with the landfill crisis problem in the county. County commissioner Milt Mack. D-Wayne, who is chairman of the committee, said the Marin facility is exceptional, the trip should be educational and he was disappointed his schedule wouldn't allow him to attend Bennett said <strong>Canton</strong> officials are \"still having discussions with Wayne Disposal to see if any kind of agreement can be reached\" separate from Wayne County LANDFILLS ARE short-term solutions to garbage disposal, Bennett said. \"What I'm looking <strong>for</strong> is to try and encourage some sort of establishment of a region-wide recycling center.\" he said. \"My bottom-line goal is Please turn to Page 2 Cameraman is'frustrated country boy' By M.B.
