Don't worry if you get the assessment wrong as it will be corrected the next time an assessment is done and you will become more familiar with the ratings with the more articles you assess.\n\nOptional: Update the UK Politics importance= rating for the article. However as we don't have an agreed set of importance criteria we are relying on editors to judge whether they think the article is of Top, High, Mid or Low importance in the overall scope of UK politics of the last 300 years. This is incredibly subjective so feel free to skip this point if you are not comfortable with it.\n\nRemove the auto= parameter from the project banner on the talk page.\n\nWhen steps 3 & 4 are completed add {{y}} ~~~~ after the entry in the task list.\n\nIf you are unsure whether the article is in our scope or not, or if you need assistance with choosing a quality rating add {{?}} and a comment after the entry in the task list.\n\nN - An article that has been checked and is not in our scope. The banner has been removed from the talk page.\n\nY - An article that has been checked and is in our scope. The banner has been updated to show the correct quality rating and \"auto=\" has been removed.\n\n? - The article has been checked but assistance is required before the task can be completed.
