What is that weird instrument at the beginning of “Strawberry Fields Forever”? How do both James Brown’s “I Got the Feeling” and The Who’s “I’m Free” put me so far off balance? Why are Brian Wilson, Frank Zappa, and Eric Clapton considered geniuses? What is the fastest rock song of the 1960s? What makes Janis Ian’s “Society’s Child” sound so profoundly sad? This book, which will address these sorts of questions and lead the reader to consider many more, was written to bring a richly detailed understanding of popular music, particularly rock music, to everyone who enjoys it, whether as a casual listener, a loyal fan, or a performing musician. Even the professional composer, performer, or educator is bound to improve their musical experience by reading this volume because even though the book assumes no prior musical knowledge, it explores every domain of rock and pop recordings in greater depth than experienced anywhere else. Our focus is on the period 1955–69. This, after all, is the golden age of rock music—of Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Ray Charles, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, The Doors, the Grateful Dead, James Brown, Janis Joplin, Chuck Berry, the\n\nvi\n\npreface Mothers, the Platters, Buddy Holly, Sly and the Family Stone, The Who, the Yardbirds, and the early Led Zeppelin. That this is considered the greatest rock music of all time is argued in major polls and critics’ lists appearing right to the present day. The actual music researched for this study occupies a broad and deep range of popular and critically acclaimed recordings. Over the better part of a year, I did little other than listen (really listen) to all 2,459 records that appeared among the top twenty positions of Billboard ’s weekly “Hot 100” singles chart, plus hundreds of notable lesser hits and more than three hundred full albums released in the same fifteen-year period, for a total sample of well over sixty-five hundred songs. (Modern jazz, existing in more of a hermetic environment, while by most accounts a type of popular music, had little impact on top album and single sales, and so is not a focus of this study.) All of this music represents the cauldron out of which rock was born, so this book is defined as covering the “Foundations of Rock Music” in reference to stylistic parentage, in reference to the embryonic nature of the era of repertoire covered, and, most importantly, in reference to the elemental materials—color, pitch, rhythm, form, lyrics, and engineering—that form the building blocks of rock music. Although the surfaces have changed greatly over the intervening years, right through the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, and Dr. Dre, the fundamentals have not. The early history of rock unfolded in an era that witnessed an increasing role of artistic experimentation in what had originally been a very direct means of expression. Despite this once-direct connection between artist and listener, the dominant method of musical reproduction—the transferring of data from plastic disc to loudspeakers—has tended to dehumanize and mystify the nature of musical sound. And because most of today’s listeners are far less aware of the qualities of music’s elements than were preceding generations, the most devoted and imaginative fan still misses out on a lot of what is conveyed, even from a good seat at a live performance. Only when listeners become consciously aware of their reactions to the despairing cry of a wah-wah pedal, the acerbic bite of off-the-string bowing, the physicality of the vocal purr, the tension underlying the anticipation of a returning harmony, the emotional release of the consonant resolution of a phrase ending, the dynamic nature of an altered scale degree, the expressive value of a particular harmonic digression, the complacency or discomfort brought on by contrasting rhythms, the intimacy or wide-open public space created by the recording engineer, and the tone and phraseology of the lyric—only then can the complete musical message come through; only then can one who has heard a familiar song for perhaps the five-hundredth time over a span of several decades fully appreciate that experience once again as if for the first time. Thus, depending on musical preferences, the newly informed listener will have a more vivid fantasy, a more exciting catharsis, a more compelling\n\npreface\n\nvii\n\nromance, a more successful rebellion—or simply a stronger distraction from the pain of the Stairmaster—while at the same time rehumanizing all those good vibrations. Although this book’s subject matter—the elements of this music and their meanings—is investigated in all possible thoroughness, there are several topics and approaches that will not be found here. We are deeply interested in what is heard from the record’s groove and the CD’s track, but not so much in the personalities or the creative procedures by which that material got there— that’s all great stuff, but it’s covered elsewhere. So for convenience’s sake, we will often refer to the singer or guitarist as the song’s agent of communication without acknowledging that it could well have been a faceless composer, producer, arranger, or even a bass player who was responsible for creating the effect of interest to us at any given time. We’ll refer to Judy Collins’s “Both Sides Now,” with full unspoken knowledge that Joni Mitchell wrote the song, Joshua Rifkin arranged it, and Mark Abramson produced it, simply for the sake of the reader who needs only to know what recording we’re discussing. Similarly, although we may seem to be ignoring the larger intertextual picture by which the listener contextualizes any given passage of a song into a life rich with potential personal, cultural, and literary references, we wish to make no claims here as to the musical or other life experiences held by the average or even the ideal reader-listener—that is for every individual to work through on their own. Nor are we here interested in the potential place of this or that musical phrase within this or any other society’s cultural experience—we thank sociologists for addressing this as they wish. There’s enough on our plate—plenty happens within a song and many are the potential meanings of its structures. We’ll happily leave it to others to explain how best to muse on its social, political, and cultural contexts. I have kept terminology as jargon-free as possible. Whereas music scholars have labored in the opposite direction, developing a rich vocabulary for achieving maximum clarity, I have sacrificed a great many academically useful words and approaches in hopes of satisfying a general audience with a more streamlined text. This will not be the place, for instance, for the reader to discover the differences among the concepts of pitch, pitch class, and note. It is hoped that the context of the discussion, despite any informality of language, will at all times contribute sufficiently to a clear understanding, and that little if any nuance of thought has been sacrificed in such a direct approach. Needless to say, concepts that have no bearing on this music will not be referred to here, no matter how central they may be to Beethoven or Brahms. Rest assured that if a topic commonly discussed in regard to other repertoires does not appear in these pages, it probably doesn’t happen in this music. Otherwise, for example, complexes such as the German and French sixths so key to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century voice leading have their\n\nvii i\n\npreface\n\nanalogues in our repertoire, but they function here so differently, these terms never need appear again. Perhaps a reader who discovers here the joys that can be had in focused listening will then go on to more formal reading in music theory and musicology as well as to a broader listening and thinking experience with many styles of music, ultimately learning about the German sixth while studying Mozart or Tchaikovsky. Those interested in continuing their reading but in a rock-only context are directed to the list of further readings found on the other side of the book’s chapters. Many readers will have some literacy in music, and can perhaps even read musical notation. Some may play an instrument. Some may know what is meant by the key of B-flat, or a G-minor scale, or an E-major chord, or “an F-sharp in the bass.” These designations are necessary for the professional musician, and are used by all sorts of practicing players, but they are unnecessary for those who just listen to music—particularly the vast majority who do not know what key a song may be in. Instead of referring to pitches by name, all pitch relations discussed in this book will be in terms of scale degree, and therefore reliance only on the numbers from 1 to 7 will simplify the reader’s task in learning what is essentially for many a new language. Scale degrees will be expressed as Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3 . . . ) when referring to individual pitches and as Roman numerals (I, ii, iii . . . ) when referring to chords. For those familiar with letter-name pitch spelling, initial discussion will relate briefly to this system through the depiction of a piano keyboard, and the Appendix will provide note-name spellings of every single chord mentioned in the book. This might be a good place to explain the slash notation that is used later in the book to indicate interactions of melodic and chordal materials: the label 5/I/3, for instance, indicates that the main melody features the fifth scale degree, which is supported by the I chord with the third scale degree in the bass, owing to the ordering of Arabic and Roman numerals as separated by slashes. From a different label, 4/V, the reader should infer that the melody has 4 over the V chord, which is presented with its root in the bass (the default position that need not be routinely indicated as 4/V/5). All of these concepts will be explained in due course, but the system’s mechanics are introduced here for ease of reference. Musical events in a particular song will often be cued for the reader by keying them to timings programmed into digital recordings, whether taken from commercial compact discs or downloaded from online files. At other times, brief quotations of lyrics will allow the reader to identify the exact spot at which a musical event appears. For instance, read the following cue, taken from Neil Sedaka’s “Calendar Girl”: “[IV] yeah, yeah, my [i°7] heart’s in a whirl, I [I] love, I love, I love my little [VIm7] calendar girl every [IIm7] day (every day), every [Vm7] day (every day) of the [I] year (every) [IV] (day of the) [I] (year).” The lead vocal line is given within quotations, and backing\n\npreface\n\nix\n\nvocal lyrics are parenthesized. This quote focuses on harmonic events, so that the IV chord is seen as sustaining through the words “yeah, yeah, my,” at which point the chord changes to i°7. The Appendix shows that the IV chord contains scale degrees 4, 6, and 1 (a fact that will be covered in many ways through the course of the book), and that in the key of C such a chord is made by combining F, A, and C. Instead of relying on musical notation, we will illustrate many concepts with recorded examples. Callouts in the text marked “Web audio example” refer to specific examples among some 285 tracks found at the book’s accompanying Web site that will enable the reader to focus on exactly the sound under discussion, whether a vocal effect, an obscure percussion instrument, a scale pattern, a harmonic relationship, or a particular rhythmic device. (Bracketed callouts labeled “Web photo” refer to photographs at the same site.) Whereas licensing issues prevent the quotation of significant portions of the lyrics of the songs under analysis, it is hoped that (1) the range of titles suggested as exemplifying any given technique will permit the reader to recognize at least one familiar song for every given case and that (2) if necessary, the convenient, legal, and inexpensive downloading of the examples referred to here will circumvent any need to purchase a greater number of recordings than desired in order to get full value from this text. In many cases, a lo-fi recording accessed without cost on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) would serve the intended illustrative purpose. Some compromises in presentation were necessary in keeping to one volume a text aimed at the novice that delves into its topics in great depth. Clear communication is this writer’s goal, and hopefully it has been achieved by streamlining vocabulary and providing all the references that might be deemed helpful, without the use of cumbersome footnotes. Nevertheless, the book’s ideas are tightly packed and the reader should not hope to absorb them quickly or in large doses. In fact, the abundance of materials in this book are offered in order that, carefully examined and considered, they may continue to reward quite a deliberate study if desired. The book’s contributions will be found most enriching when the text, Web audio examples and photographs, and the cited recordings from 1955–1969 are consulted together, fully compared back and forth. It is hoped that the reader’s patience and the investment of time required by some of the more involved discussions will be well repaid. And whereas I have labored for years now to refine this book, errors have undoubtedly escaped my notice, and I would be grateful to readers who might inform me of necessary corrections. The book is organized so as to cover all fundamental aspects of rock music and its popular cousins in a sequence that will best help the reader grow in knowledge and confidence. We begin with five chapters focusing mostly on uses of instrumentation and voice, as most of these sounds—guitars, bass,\n\nx\n\npreface\n\ndrums, keyboards, and vocals—are familiar to most listeners. But our study will probe the depths of the tonal colors, the performance techniques, and the functional values of these forces, establishing as we go some basic systems by which we’ll treat matters of melody, harmony, and rhythm throughout the book. Chapter 6 covers the formal sections of the popular song, so that all subsequent discussions may refer to the intro, verse, bridge, chorus, break, or motto in the knowledge that the reader understands what part of a given song is up for discussion. Then, we enter the highly detailed world of pitch, the parameter that most sets music apart from all other arts. One chapter on the principles of melodic construction will be followed by four chapters on various topics dealing with harmony—chords and their connections—in every usage known in the repertoire. Chapter 12 isolates rhythm, and here we cover all matters of tempo, rhythm, and meter. In Chapter 13, the recording techniques of the 1950s and ‘60s are detailed, so that a listener can learn to become aware of all types of electronic effects brought to bear in a recording, many of them relating closely to the expressive purpose of the song at hand. In Chapter 14, aspects of lyric writing are covered to enable a listener to form his or her own interpretation of their poetic meanings on their own and as tied to the accompanying musical ideas through various critical stances. At the end of the process, a listener should be able to identify the sources of any and all sounds in a recording, understand the purely musical relationships through which they interact, and interpret the meanings suggested by lyrics and music together—not only for any record of the 1950s or ’60s but practically for any popular song of the past century or more. Those with stronger musical inclinations should find themselves able as never before to compose, arrange, and produce excellent recordings in most any style popular in this period. As Ringo once directed before a guitar break, “Rock on, anybody!”\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nT\n\nhis book was written with the support of a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Horace H. Rackham Faculty Fellowship Enhancement Award, which provided for a year of time released from teaching responsibilities. Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect those of the National Endowment of the Humanities. I am grateful to the brilliant musicians who graciously gave of their time and expertise in reading and commenting on early chapter drafts: Christopher Doll, Andy Flory, Dai Griffiths, Virgil Moorefield, William Moylan, Shaugn O’Donnell, George Shirley, Mark Spicer, Gordon Thompson, and an anonymous reader contacted by Oxford University Press all prevented some of my unhelpful errors from making it to the final pages. Music Editor Suzanne Ryan and Associate Editor Norm Hirschy have been generous with their support, brimming over with great ideas, and unusually helpful in realizing the potential of my own point of view and desires in ways I could not envision myself. From start to finish, it has been an absolute pleasure and a terrifically rewarding experience working with Suzanne and Norm.\n\nxii\n\nacknowledgments\n\nThe recording of the book’s accompanying audio examples required the coordination of many people and facilities at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance. Under the auspices and arrangements of Deans Christopher Kendall and Mary Simoni and with the cheerful support and assistance of audio resources coordinator Dave Greenspan, engineers Jason Corey and Kristin Fosdick, Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments Director Chris Dempsey, percussion facilitator Neeraj Mehta, piano technicians Robert Grijalva and Norman Vesprini, and staff and faculty members David Aderente, Lynne Aspnes, Fritz Kaenzig, Ken Kiesler, Marilyn Mason, Edward Parmentier, Stephen Rush, Ramon Satyendra, Michael Udow, and Brent Wagner, I was able to secure the world-class facilities of the Duderstadt Center Audio Studio, the use of many fine instruments, and the services of many Michigan student performers all of whom are credited in the online audio captions. Thanks also to Greg Laman for tutelage and trouble-shooting advice in Logic Pro and to Neile Rissmiller and Elizabeth Burr for desktop and wireless tech support. Recordings were made possible by grants from the School of Music, Theatre & Dance of the University of Michigan that were administered by Julie Smigielski, and from the Society for Music Theory. Scheduling was coordinated by Kimberley Osburn. I am fortunate beyond measure to have such wonderful, generous, and highly professional colleagues.\n\nNotes on the Web Site\n\nA\n\nfull appreciation of the contents of this text will depend upon a rich interaction with its companion Web site, found at http://www.oup.com/us/thefoundationsofrock. This site is replete with hundreds of audio examples and photographs created precisely to illustrate this book’s points as clearly as possible. When the aural examples are studied alongside the text, the reader’s experience will be more richly alive and comprehension will be fuller, allowing for an easy, active transfer from the knowledge gained here to the experience of real-world listening. In fact, the ready availability of the book’s Web site also means the ready availability of digital versions of all recordings cited in the text, nearly all of which are licensed at the major online repositories (iTunes, Amazon, Wal-Mart, etc.) and presented on YouTube. Each Web audio example has its own caption, adding cues to help the listener focus on the point at hand and crediting performers. Web photo captions also add information for further clarification. It is recommended that listeners use headphones. Even small earbuds will produce a far better\n\nxiv\n\nnotes on the web site response than do the tiny drivers in laptops, which often cannot convey any bass at all. Most desktop machines include built-in speakers of moderate quality, but the listener may experience severe distortion and clipping from these at louder volume levels. Standalone external monitors are better still as long as the listener can control a good stereo balance.\n\nContents\n\nChapter 1\n\nDrums, Other Percussion, and a Bit about Rhythm 3\n\nChapter 2\n\nGuitars, the Bass, and an Introduction to Harmony 29\n\nChapter 3\n\nKeyboards and a Summary of EarlyRock Instrumentation 65\n\nChapter 4\n\nSweetening with Band, Orchestral, and Other Instruments 93\n\nChapter 5 Vocal Color, Technique, and Arrangement 117\n\nxv i\n\ncontents Chapter 6\n\nForms: Phrases and Sections\n\n134\n\nChapter 7\n\nMelody: Materials and Patterns\n\nChapter 8\n\nChord Construction\n\nChapter 9\n\nDiatonic Harmonic Function\n\nChapter 10\n\nHarmony in Minor and Other Nonmajor Modes 237\n\nChapter 11\n\nChromatic Harmony\n\n157\n\n190 214\n\n269\n\nChapter 12 Musical Time: Rhythm, Meter, and Tempo 302 Chapter 13\n\nEngineering the Master\n\n333\n\nChapter 14\n\nCreating an Interpretation\n\n362\n\nAppendix: Lexicon of Chord Symbols 401 Further Print Resources in Pop-Rock Music of the 1950s–60s 407 Index of Topics 411\n\nThe Foundations of Rock\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER \n\nDrums, Other Percussion, and a Bit about Rhythm\n\nT\n\nrained musicians who are so inclined love to talk about melody, harmony, and intricate rhythmic and formal patterns. In some cases where I’ve discussed such matters with general audiences that are not so trained, I’m told that it’s the basic “sound,” more than these more advanced properties, that makes rock music meaningful to them. Their point is well taken. The sound of the sound, its color—the characteristics that enable us to tell one instrument from another or one singer from another or one guitar effect from another—are a very sensible place to begin to point the ear in order to focus on the aural experience. In our first five chapters, we’ll cover every single device used to produce the sounds that create the pop music of the 1950s and ’60s. First, in chapters 1 through 3, we’ll examine the instruments of the rock band from its foundation, drums and bass, through its different kinds of guitars and keyboards. This will be followed in chapter 4 by a look at how every single orchestral, wind-band, and other instrument originally created for preceding styles has been borrowed in our pop-rock repertoire. In chapter 5, we’ll consider the ins and outs of vocal sonorities. For each instrument and voice type, we’ll discuss pertinent concepts of tone production, the ways in which those sounds function on their own, and the 3\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n4\n\nways in which they combine with other sonic forces to create full textures. Along the way, we’ll introduce some important concepts of rhythm and pitch that will prepare us for later chapters on rhythm, melody, and harmony. Our survey begins with the keeping of the beat . . .\n\nDrums and drumming The most universal complaint of adults in the 1950s and ’60s: “rock ‘n’ roll is NOISE.” There were many reasons for this reaction: rock singers, when they belted out their songs, placed little or no value on any ideal beauty of tone that had been prized for many generations; featured instruments such as guitars and piano often had more of a rhythmic function than one of providing melodic lines that would complement the vocalist’s melody; the amplification of electrified instruments and the colorings provided—or subtracted—by the engineers who produced the recordings often seemed to remove subtleties of quiet nuance from the picture and to encourage a shrinking of the overall dynamic range. The recordings, now supplanting live performances as the main source of musical experience, were sometimes played via mistreated vinyl on poor equipment that added heavy distortion to the signal when cranked up to the desired volume. But probably the most important reason for the noise complaint was rock’s new emphasis on the drummer. In classical music, only the most massive orchestral music of the previous hundred years would require more than one percussionist, and solo, choral, and chamber music usually employed none at all. A single drummer in a swing band, even though heavily outnumbered and outsounded by melodious brass and saxes, did not have to play loudly to be the group’s timepiece. In a jazz trio, where one of three played a trap set, the drummer often used soft-sounding brushes so as to stay out of the pianist’s or wind player’s way. In rock, the drummer could play as loudly as possible, even when he was one of only four or five group members, even before amplifiers became much more powerful in the late ’60s. Drums are the main reason adults relegated rehearsing rock groups to the garage. The rock drummer maintains the pulse that holds the group together and connects directly with listeners’ physiology, driving them to dance, igniting the exuberance that would deafen the young to all requests to turn it down. The drummer is largely concerned with keeping the ensemble together (consider expert session players like Hal Blaine, as heard in records by Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Phil Spector, and the Beach Boys), keeping the energy level at a high roar (think Keith Moon of The Who), taking the group from one section of a song to another through connective and often propulsive fills (Ringo Starr of the Beatles), shaping the groove that controls the\n\ndrums, other percussion, and a bit about rhythm 5\n\nperformance’s flow (Benny Benjamin of Motown), and occasionally taking center stage with imaginative solos (Ginger Baker of Cream). Drummers have a wide range of techniques, styles, and degrees of control or wildness. We’ll examine a number of such characteristics by reviewing a few of a drummer’s roles, establishing a few basic concepts pertaining to rhythm, and looking at the drum kit itself. Exceedingly rare is the rock song with no drumming at all. Among them are Elvis’s first singles for Sun, including “That’s All Right,” “Milkcow Blues Boogie,” and “Baby Let’s Play House,” released in 1954–55 before anyone knew drums would be “required.” Similarly, only two songs among Bob Dylan’s first four LPs, “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” and “Corrina, Corrina,” include drums, but these were cut before anyone—the artist included—knew he was a rocker at heart. Like Dylan’s early work, Simon and Garfunkel’s “Sounds of Silence” was recorded without drums (and first released that way in 1964 with only two vocals and a lightly picked acoustic guitar), but producer Tom Wilson beefed it up without the duo’s knowledge with overdubbed electric guitar, electric bass, and drums for its hit-bound release as a 1966 single. These examples aside, only a few rare top-twenty songs like Chuck Berry’s “Havana Moon,” Frankie Laine’s “Love is a Golden Ring,” and Elvis Presley’s “Crying in the Chapel” omit drums entirely, and this is always done for a particular effect. Much more often, drums are omitted for just one section of a song as a foil, as in the intros to the Crests’ “Sixteen Candles” and Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams,” and the first verse of James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain,” allowing the delayed drum entry to provide renewed strength to succeeding passages. Some rock drumming is virtuosic. Some cases, such as that spotlightsamitiut011\n\n6\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Otherwise, rock’s most flamboyant drumming appears in brief bursts, as in the six-second solo in the Ventures’ “Perfida,” the several solos of Sandy Nelson’s “Let There Be Drums,” the celebrated patterns of the Surfaris’ “Wipe Out,” and the manifold sorts of fleeting drum breaks that lead from one section of a song to another in most of the repertoire. Drums are out front for a variety of reasons, sometimes arbitrary, and it’s certainly an unquestioned norm. With the Dave Clark Five, one gets the impression that the drums are mixed to the fore in tracks like “Glad All Over” because (1) not much else is going on and (2) the procedure features the group’s leader, a drummer who set up on stage in front of the guitars, as a marketing ploy. Only the first of these two reasons could explain the same characteristic in tracks such as Bob Seger’s “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man.” In Steam’s “Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye),” the solo drumming beginning at 1:44 seems the result of a post-production decision to mute everything else in the mix momentarily, and the drum solo (plus tambourine) in the Beatles’ “Birthday” seems like a stretch intended for band overdubs that never materialized. Clem Cattini goes wild on the skins in Donovan’s “Hurdy Gurdy Man” not because the song’s poetics demand it, but because he’s trying to keep up with hard-rocking bandmates John Paul Jones (bass) and Alan Parker (electric guitar). The dual drummers of the Grateful Dead sometimes blend together in an extended flurry; at other times they have separate agendas (they’re quite distinct in “New Potato Caboose,” Anthem of the Sun, CD remix, 5:53 to the end, with Mickey Hart on the left and Bill Kreutzman on the right). “Listen Here,” by Brian Auger and the Trinity, features four jazz drummers pursuing quite different simultaneous ideas. Much more interesting is the work of a single musician, working in counterpoint with his fellow instrumentalists, as with Ringo Starr’s playing in the Beatles’ “Rain” and “A Day in the Life,” Ginger Baker’s in Cream’s “Crossroads” and “Spoonful” (Wheels of Fire performances), or even Gene Chrisman’s understated snare in Merrilee Rush’s “Angel of the Morning.” The contrapuntal potential of the drummer was realized in a new way in the late ’60s by multiple miking of the set, allowing different parts of the kit to appear in different parts of the stereo image, as in Blood, Sweat and Tears’ “And When I Die.” Usually, the drums are a seat of power, and the unleashing of their fury can suggest life-changing ecstasy in Little Richard’s “Tutti–Frutti,” psychological volatility in the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s “Manic Depression” and Led Zeppelin’s “Dazed and Confused,” apocalyptic pronouncement in The Doors’ “The End,” antiauthoritarian bravado in The Who’s “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,” blistering anger in The Who’s “I Can See For Miles,” or\n\ndrums, other percussion, and a bit about rhythm 7 the threatening total loss of control in The Who’s “My Generation.” Yes, The Who’s Keith Moon was a wild man, and his eventual replacement, Kenney Jones, can be heard first establishing his own Moonish credentials in the Small Faces’ “Song of a Baker.” Rudiments, or the snare techniques practiced to perfection by military and orchestral drummers (and the basis of Dead drummer Mickey Hart’s mother’s award-winning skills), are generally of remote interest here. Occasionally a rock listener hears a flam, where a dynamically accented snare hit is immediately preceded by another for added emphasis, and you’ve got those short paradiddle drills after the refrain of Neil Sedaka’s “Calendar Girl,” the upbeats of the Everly Brothers’ “Cathy’s Clown,” and those funny little bits in Dylan’s “Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I’ll Go Mine),” but the roll is the only other rudimentary “trick” known to rock, and it isn’t very common. (Listen to Web audio examples 1.01 and 1.02.) The longest roll of this era may be that by Nick Mason in Pink Floyd’s “The Grand Vizier’s Garden Party” (directly after the opening flute duet); Ringo plays them only in “All You Need Is Love,” “Nowhere Man,” and “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,” and that’s pretty much it for drum rolls in British rock. Americans are much more prone to feature them, as in Perry Como’s “Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom),” James Darren’s “Goodbye Cruel World” and “Her Royal Majesty,” the Miracles’ “Tracks of My Tears,” Bobby Hebb’s “Sunny,” The Mamas and the Papas’ “Words of Love,” the Outsiders’ “Time Won’t Let Me,” the Mothers of Invention’s “Plastic People,” The Grateful Dead’s “Easy Wind,” Sly and the Family Stone’s “Stand!,” and The Association’s “Requiem for the Masses.” Seven of these eleven are played by session drummers rather than group members, who are less often trained. Despite the general disinterest in rudiments, two-stick snare marches make for the most common drum-based symbol in pop, bringing militaristic and patriotic themes into about three dozen hits of the era. Witness inspiring marches in Mitch Miller’s “March from the River Kwai,” Johnny Desmond’s “The Yellow Rose of Texas,” Johnny Horton’s “The Battle of New Orleans,” and Jimmy Dean’s “P. T. 109,” raw jingoism in Senator Dirksen’s “Gallant Men,” Ssgt Barry Sadler’s “The Ballad of the Green Berets,” and Victor Lundberg’s “An Open Letter to My Teenage Son,” cartoonish battle scenes in the Royal Guardsmen’s “Snoopy vs. the Red Baron” and The Fifth Estate’s “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead,” a simple army chant in Art Mooney’s “Honey-Babe,” a psychedelic bolero in the Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit,” pitchless poetry in Van Morrison’s “Madame George,” and dedication in an antiwar pair, the Butterfield Blues Band’s “Love March” and Original Caste’s “One Tin Soldier.”\n\n8\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\nRhythm: Beats, meter, and groove To get any deeper into drumming technique, we’ll have to cover a few technical points about how rhythm works. One can’t have rhythm without meter. Meter is the imaginary background grid of regularly recurring pulses against which performed rhythmic patterns are heard and interpreted. Meter provides a constant flow of inaudible beats, some of which Meter: a grid of regular, (or some parts of which) are manifested in the inaudible pulses actual rhythms of a song, and some of which pass silently by. In many songs, the drums simply beat Rhythm: the out the meter, marking every beat uniformly on articulation of time as the snare for a hard-driving effect; this is true in measured against the underlying meter the Rolling Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” Bob Dylan’s “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,” and many early Motown productions with Benny Benjamin on drums (the Four Tops’ “It’s the Same Old Song,” “Shake Me, Wake Me,” and “Bernadette,” and the Supremes’ “Nothing But Heartaches,” for example). (Listen to Web audio example 1.03.) Sometimes, only a portion of a song will be drummed this way; note the driving intro to the Box Tops’ “The Letter,” or the choruses of the Zombies’ “She’s Not There” and the Union Gap’s “Young Girl.” Meter, however, is more complex than is realized in these basic examples. In its full glory, it is organized into different levels by regular alternations of strong and weak beats, strong and weak parts of beats, and strong and weak parts of the parts. (It even has higher levels that recognize strong and weak groups of beats.) Rhythms, in contrast to meter, can provide any combination of strong and weak accents in either regular or irregular patterns. Rhythms often align with meter, or they can syncopate against it by emphasizing normally weak beats (or their parts), thus creating the great off-balance, propulsive tension typical of rock music. Drummers typically will set up regularly recurring rhythmic patterns that may or may not agree with the underlying meter, and then embellish the patterns with new levels of accents on ever smaller parts of beats, and then may change them completely. When a rhythmic pattern recurs throughout a song or a section of a song, it is referred to as the groove—especially when the bass, rhythm guitar, or keyboardist participate—and is often a defining characteristic of a song. Let’s demonstrate these ideas further and at the same time add a bit of detail to the basics, just enough to support our current investigation. (We’ll cover aspects of meter much more thoroughly later in our “Rhythm” chapter.) Meters will most often involve recurring groupings of either four beats or three, with the first beat of each group accented in relation to the others. So when one counts a recurring series of regularly spaced beats (“ONE— two—Three—four—ONE—two—Three—four—ONE—two . . .,”\n\ndrums, other percussion, and a bit about rhythm 9 with each upper-case word indicating a loud accent and each capitalized initial letter applied to a beat of lesser accent), meter is established. This example, “ONE—two—Three—four—ONE—two—Three—four . . .,” represents quadruple meter (four beats per bar), whereas “ONE—two— three—ONE—two—three—ONE—two—three . . .” is the basis of triple meter (three beats per bar). (Listen to Web audio examples 1.04 and 1.05.) Think of the first verse of the Turtles’ “Happy Together” (“imagine me and you, I do,” beginning at 0:08), where the drummer simply articulates every beat on the left channel; can you hear/feel that these beats are grouped into patterns of four beats each? ONE—two—Three—four—ONE—two—Three— four. . . . The drum rhythm perfectly matches the underlying meter. (Note that the pitch of the recurring vocal pattern, and each underlying chord, drops by step every two bars, or every eight beats. While drummers often set the meter, the chord changes and such vocal patterns as these typically reinforce it.) Other examples of quadruple meter include Elvis Presley’s “Hound Dog,” Bobby Darin’s “Mack the Knife,” the Beatles’ “Hey Jude,” and Marvin Gaye’s “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Despite the fact that these songs all move at different tempos (rates of speed), they all have four beats per bar. Triple meter occurs much less often than does quadruple, but it’s still very popular. The best-known triple-meter songs of our era include Kay Starr’s “Rock and Roll Waltz” and Patti Page’s “The Tennessee Waltz” (maybe an obvious pair), but they also include examples as different as Elvis Presley’s “Are You Lonesome To-night?,” Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe,” the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s “Manic Depression,” the Beatles’ “Dig a Pony,” and James Taylor’s “Sweet Baby James.” The drummer leads the rhythm section, which also includes the bass and other accompanimental instruments such as rhythm guitar and keyboards. The rhythm section sets the groove, the steady repetitive accompaniment against which the singer(s) and any soloists may have much more varied rhythms. The drummer pretty much controls the pocket, the repetitive pattern basic to the groove. (In its earliest usage, the word “pocket” referred to a flexible space in which the articulation of the backbeat could be delayed; more on this later.) The pocket’s pattern is based on how various beats are accented within the meter. Beats have different sorts of functions (and are therefore given different labels) depending on where they fall in the metric pattern: In quadruple meter, odd-numbered beats are strong and the alternating even-numbered beats are weak. In triple meter, the one strong beat, the first of every pattern, is followed by two weak beats. Beat “ONE” is always the downbeat, metrically the strongest beat of each bar, and all others are backbeats. The last beat of the bar, the weakest, is the upbeat. Count a few bars of quadruple meter (ONE—two—Three—four—ONE—two—Three— four . . . ) and try to feel a strong downbeat on every “ONE,” a less strong\n\n10\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n“Three,” and “four” feeling the weakest of all; this is a normal metric accent pattern. Backbeat drumming, in which beats two and four are accented much more strongly than the metrically strong beats, is a common form of syncopation—a word for a rhythm’s accent pattern working against the regular underlying strong-weak pattern of the natural metric accent. We can portray a backbeat rhythm against the quadruple meter by notating the beats articulated by the rhythm spelled out and the silent metric beats shown by parenthesized numerals: (1)—two—(3)—four—(1)—two—(3)—four. (Say the spelled-out numbers out loud, but feel and think the parenthesized numerals silently as thwarted metric accents, all numbers continuing at the same pace; you are now performing both a quadruple meter and a syncopated backbeat rhythm against it.) The drummer is accenting snare backbeats in Web audio example 1.04. To appreciate how common backbeat drumming is in rock music, consider that it is basic to examples as diverse as the Everly Brothers’ “When Will I Be Loved,” the Supremes’ “I Hear a Symphony,” Judy Collins’s “Both Sides Now,” the Mothers of Invention’s “Orange County Lumber Truck,” and everywhere else that beats two and four are played (particularly by the drummer) louder than the naturally accented beats one and three. The backbeat rhythm, depending on how it interacts with other instruments, can be energetic, as with the piston-powered “Maybelline,” or it can be determined and angry, as in Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young’s protest, “Ohio.” Parts of beats that fall between the timepoints marked by beat numbers are considered offbeats; these generally divide the beats in half (ONE—and—two—and—Three—and—four—and . . .) but are actually infinite in number due to the continual subdivision of metric layers. Beats are somewhat plastic as well; in backbeat drumming, the snare may be delayed slightly behind beats two and four. Note Charlie Watts’s playing deep in the pocket, holding back the Rolling Stones in “Honest I Do.” Rock historian and drummer Gordon Thompson likens this plastic quality of the beat to pitch intonation in a useful way—he finds that many drummers work to delay or “flat” the beat because most musicians tend to rush, “sharping” the beat. In the first verse of the Turtles’ “Happy Together,” referred to earlier, every beat is played on both the bass drum and snare; later, in the first refrain, the bass drum calls attention to itself and throws the listener off balance by the kicks heard slightly after the strong beats at 0:22 and 0:23; these forcefully counterbalance the swinging offbeats lazily placed just before the beats by the singer in the prior verse. (If you have access to this recording, or a particularly vivid musical memory, think: How are the beats ornamented in “imagine me and you . . .” or, in the second verse, “if I should call you\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 11\n\nPhoto 1.01. The Pearl Vision trap drum set as seen from the drummer’s throne. This is a fusion set, with toms scaled 2” smaller than those in the standard set. Measurements refer to the diameters of the drum shells; this dimension determines the drums’ fundamentals. (Photo: Annie Eastman)\n\nup . . .”?) One common way to embellish the backbeat is to also play the “and” of two, which appears exactly halfway between two and three: (1)—two—and—(3)—four. This was particularly a hallmark of hits appearing in the years from 1960 to 1962, and can be heard as basic to the groove in the Shirelles’ “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” and “Baby It’s You,” the MarKeys’ “Last Night,” the Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ Safari,” and the Contours’ “Do You Love Me,” all from that period. (Listen to Web audio example 1.06.) The drum set: bass drum, floor and rack tom-toms, snare, ride and crash cymbals, hi-hat. Following descriptions of the pieces, their typical usages are detailed.\n\nThe trap set Let’s be sure we understand the drummer’s equipment so that we’ll be able to see how different sounds are created and used for different rhythmic functions. The drum set, or traps, or the kit, consists of a number of drums and suspended cymbals arranged for the convenience of a single seated player. (See Web photos 1.01–1.06.) The larger the multilayered hardwood shell and corresponding drum skin (“head”), the deeper the sound, and so the large bass drum (the one facing the audience, its outer skin a handy location for the band’s logo), typically struck on strong beats, provides the group’s rhythmic foundation. Drum heads were regularly made from calfskin until\n\n12\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k the introduction of one- and two-ply Mylar, which could produce a sharper attack, circa 1958. The bass drum is also called the kick drum because it is struck by a beater hinged to a metal plate depressed by the right foot. One might notice that Dixieland bands once used a very large-diameter bass drum (though still smaller than the slow-responding orchestral bass drum of 32 to 36 inches), and that there is a good range of bass-drum sizes (16 to 26 inches) today; jazz drummers tend to continue to prefer more boom from the bass drum than do rock drummers. Rarely, a rock drummer of the ’60s will have two kick drums producing different tones (as with Ginger Baker’s pair) or allowing rapid serial two-foot attacks (Keith Moon’s); paired bass drums are much more common today, especially in hard rock, and many drummers have a modern doublepedal for a single drum. Other drums become higher in pitch and faster in the bark of the attack as the diameter grows smaller from perhaps eighteen to about nine inches, and consist of any number of tom-toms (the rack toms are mounted atop the bass drum, whereas the large floor tom-tom rests on its own legs) and the narrow 14”-across snare, which has a dozen or so loosely coiled metal wires stretched across its thin lower resonant head, adding a characteristic snap when the upper beater head is struck. (See Web photos 1.07 and 1.08.) All toms and snare are played by the sticks or, fairly commonly in the 1950s and ’60s, by wire brushes swept across the heads. Drummers often color the vibrations of their drums by covering them with towels, damping them with cigarette packs, or applying masking or duct tape to the heads, usually so as to subdue any unsatisfying ringing. (Listen to Web audio example 1.07.) Cymbals of a brass-tin alloy are suspended from their centers on stands that allow them to ring when struck until they fade away or are damped by hand. Different diameters, thicknesses, and other more subtle qualities determine the loudness and reverberation time of various cymbals, and so the rock drummer would typically have at least two for contrasting colors, and perhaps a good number more. Cymbals also produce different sounds depending upon where they are struck. When tapped near the center, on the bell, a purer brass sound with little ringing results, as heard in the intros to the Animals’ “We Gotta Get Out Of This Place” (from the third tap; the first two strike more closely to the edge) and Sam and Dave’s “Soul Man,” or in signaling the verse’s return in the Dead’s “Easy Wind” (3:33–3:50). When struck toward the rim, a richer, louder crash results; note every downbeat of the intro to Steppenwolf ’s “Born to Be Wild.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.08.) Struck forcefully at the rim, a cymbal can achieve great sustain; see Paul McCartney’s “Singalong Junk.” Typically, continuous ride patterns (often articulating both halves of every beat, as one—and—two—and— three—and . . .) are played through sections of a song on thicker, larger, cymbals, whereas occasional crashes and splashes from the rims of thinner, smaller\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 13 cymbals mark musical climaxes or formal turning points, perhaps once every eight or sixteen bars. (Listen to Web audio example 1.09.) Some drummers prefer cymbals pierced by loose rivets for a sizzling ring (see Blind Faith’s “Can’t Find My Way Home,” 0:58). Completing the basic kit is the hi-hat, which mounts two matched cymbals above and below each other on a stand and brings them together (not too unlike the clashing of two hand-held cymbals in a military band or orchestra) by a pedal controlled by the left foot. (Listen to Web audio example 1.10.) Typical footwork strikes the bass drum on strong beats and the hi-hat on weak beats. (Listen to Web audio example 1.11.) Occasionally, the hi-hat may emphasize a very weak metric position, as in Arthur Alexander’s “Anna,” where only the second half of Three is struck—musically defining the weakness of the stricken singer—but here the hi-hat is given a stick stroke, not pedaled. The hi-hat can be sticked when the pair is partially open or closed, or the pair may be struck when completely open and then pedaled closed. (Listen to Web audio example 1.12.) All these techniques yield characteristic effects. Just as cymbals can be pierced by rivets, they can also support a tambourinelike jangle-box; one is heard atop the hi-hat in the Grateful Dead’s “Casey Jones” (1:22–1:56). Some trap sets of the ’60s would also include cowbell and woodblock, perhaps a pair of bongos, and some players (notably the Grateful Dead’s Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzman) customized their live-performance percussion collections to orchestral proportions, often adding exotic\n\nPhoto 1.02. Mike Gabelman on his silver-sparkle Yamaha drum kit. (Photo: Annie Eastman)\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n14\n\nnon-Western instruments to their arsenals. In recordings, nearly all drumming would be enhanced by tambourines, maracas, and/or other percussion instruments, typically added in overdub sessions; these will be described below after we cover a bit more of the role of the kit, piece by piece. So the band’s foundation is typically laid by strong beats on bass drum and weak beats on hi-hat. This is often ornamented, as when the bass drum adds anticipatory kicks, in a ONE—(2)—and—Three—(4)—and—ONE— (2)—and—Three—(4)—and pattern, in conjunction with the weak-beat hi-hat (pedaled closed on two and four) (compare Web audio example 1.12), as in Roy Orbison’s “Blue Bayou,” Marvin Gaye’s “I Heard It Through the Grapevine,” and the chorus of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles’ “The Tears of a Clown.” In the Orbison recording, note how the bass guitar is locked to the bass drum’s rhythm, both setting the groove. A slightly more complex version of this pattern opens the Supremes’ “My World Is Empty Without You,” again with the bass guitar locked to the bass drum. Sometimes a pattern is created progressively. In Sandy Nelson’s “Teen Beat,” the bass drum opens with two toms; the snare enters after five seconds of this, and at 0:29 the ride cymbal arrives; it’s all traps until guitar and piano enter at 0:34. Sometimes the drummer will drop the bomb (a reference to an unprepared and isolated kick of the bass drum as in the Crew Cuts’ “Sh-Boom,” at 1:22) or give the bass drum its little solo; note Ringo’s unconventional bass-drum march in the Beatles’ “Yellow Submarine” (0:10–0:17). The bass drum is all alone in articulating every beat for three bars (1:21+) in Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass’s “A Taste of Honey,” until a sustained trombone alarm warns of the impending verse. This use of the bass drum is repeated in Tommy James and the Shondells’ “Hanky Panky” and Nancy Sinatra’s “Lightning’s Girl,” and done with offbeats marked as well (ONE—and—two—and— Three—and—four—and . . .) in Freddie Cannon’s “Way Down Yonder in New Orleans” and Neil Sedaka’s “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.” The bass drum affects a door slam in Betty Johnson’s “The Little Blue Man” and a door knock in the Stones’ “Tell Me (You’re Coming Back).” (Conversely, Ray Charles’s drummer “knocks” repeatedly on the snare in “Hallelujah! I Love Her So,” as does Eddie Floyd’s in “Knock on Wood.”) The snare is generally struck by the stick, but the use of brushes continues from earlier jazz practice. In fact, some jazz numbers continue to bring a brushed snare into the top twenty in the 1950s and ’60s: Crazy Otto’s “Glad Rag Doll” (a honky-tonk number), Eddie Heywood’s “Soft Summer Breeze” (piano trio), Nina Simone’s “I Loves You, Porgy” (vocal), Rosemary Clooney’s “Memories of You” (featuring Benny Goodman’s clarinet), and Kenny Ball’s “Midnight in Moscow” (a minor-mode Dixieland septet), to mention a few. Otherwise, brushes would be called for most often in soft ballads (Pat Boone’s “I’ll Be Home,” Ray Charles’s “Georgia On My Mind,” and James Taylor’s\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 15 “Sweet Baby James”). Phil Ochs uses the brushed snare along with a tack piano and whimsical cowbell to ironic effect in the upbeat narration of the broad-daylight killing of Kitty Genovese in “Outside of a Small Circle of Friends.” A more hackneyed result is heard in Teresa Brewer’s “A Sweet Old Fashioned Girl,” wherein the Jekyll-and-Hyde singer affects an old-fashioned innocence in major-mode sections with smooth strings and brushed snare, but becomes a “crazy rock ’n’ rollin’ little Goldilocks” in contrasting sections with loud sticked backbeat snare, gritty saxes, and brash trumpet stabs. Although the dance-band rimshot (one stick held against both the batter head and rim, the second stick striking the first sharply) is not part of the 1950s–’60s experience, the snare would frequently be tapped rhythmically on its rim; varied examples include Lonnie Donegan’s vaudeville revival, “Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight,” the Johnny Burnette Trio’s “Lonesome Tears In My Eyes,” Bob Dylan’s “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,” R. B. Greaves’s “Take a Letter Maria,” Nilsson’s “I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City,” and the second verse of “Try a Little Tenderness” as recorded by both Otis Redding and Three Dog Night. Buddy Holly’s drummer, Jerry Allison, added strong toms to “Words of Love,” “Not Fade Away,” and “Peggy Sue,” and that’s Allison on the large toms on the Everly Brothers’ “(’Til) I Kissed You.” His style of continuous tom battering was adopted in Tommy Roe’s “Sheila” (no surprise there, as Roe sought to fill Holly’s shoes in many ways), but also in Barrett Strong’s “Money (That’s What I Want).” The toms are often heard in cascades highlighting their different pitches (recall Web audio example 1.07), as in the break in the Outsiders’ “Time Won’t Let Me” (1:43–1:45), the bridge of the Everlys’ “When Will I Be Loved,” and the intro of the Buckinghams’ “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.” Sometimes one or two toms will carry a distinctive repeated tattoo rhythm, as in the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby” (one tom doing ONE—(2)—and—Three, answered by another tom and handclaps on four), the Four Seasons’ “Big Girls Don’t Cry” (one tom hitting (1)—and—a— two—and—(3)—and—a—four—and, with a second tom hitting on Three only), and the American Breed’s “Bend Me, Shape Me” (simply one tom’s ONE—and—a—two—and—a—Three—and—a—four—and—a). In that culturally insensitive age, toms were still Native American totems, as in the 1910 Fruitgum Co.’s “Indian Giver” and the Electric Indian’s “Keem-O-Sabe.” It happens rarely, but toms and snare may be combined in patterns, as in the opening of the Four Seasons’ “Walk Like a Man,” where the snare is struck four times in the first beat (ONE—ee—and—a), a tom four times in the second (two—ee—and—a), the snare four times again in the third (Three—ee—and—a), and then the bass drum marks the fourth (four!). Long rolls on the tom are rare but can be heard at the beginnings of the Marvelettes’ “When You’re Young and in Love” and Jimi Hendrix’s “May\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n16\n\nThis Be Love,” and in the majestic ending of the Moody Blues’ “Peak Hour.” In the Beach Boys’ “That’s Not Me,” drummer Hal Blaine breaks out of the groove at 0:17 with lots of confident tone-painting toms as Brian Wilson sings, “I could try to be big in the eyes of the world.” The ride cymbal (or the closed hi-hat) is typically used for a regular repeated pattern, as with the opening of Henry Mancini’s “Peter Gunn,” the Champs’ “Tequila,” and The Doors’ “The Crystal Ship.” Often, this is combined with a backbeat snare pattern, as in the Ventures’ “Walk—Don’t Run.” Sometimes, the ride cymbal provides a change of color for contrasting sections, as in the mood-shifting prechorus of the Zombies’ “She’s Not There” (at “but it’s too late to say you’re sorry . . .”) and the tension-ratcheting bridge of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit” (“when men on the chessboard . . .”). Regular ride patterns seem to be required in slow compound meters (where each beat is divided into three, not the usual two, equal offbeats), as in the Beach Boys’ “Surfer Girl” and Percy Sledge’s “When a Man Loves a Woman,” both of which also feature strong snare backbeats (the ride and snare combining for a “ONE—trip—let—two—trip—let—Three—trip—let—four—trip—let” groove). The ride cymbal illustrates a few suggestive effects, as with the bell portrayed in Trini Lopez’s “If I Had a Hammer,” the rainfall suggested in the opening half-minute of Jimi Hendrix’s “One Rainy Wish,” and a metaphorical accusatory finger wagging in the intro to Gladys Knight and the Pips’ “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Jazz drummer Michael Giles of King Crimson alternates between the bells of two ride cymbals (mixed at the extreme left and right of the stereo image) in “Moonchild.” Ride patterns may be played on a crash cymbal for a raucous tone, as heard in the Rebels’ “Wild Weekend”; the crash carries an unusual backbeat pattern in The Mamas and the Papas’ “Words of Love.” A great variety of color is sought with the crash cymbal, sometimes blending beautifully with other instruments. It is played with a soft yarn or felt mallet for great longsustaining pink-noise atmosphere in Spirit’s pre-Aquarius “Taurus,” and pairs of these mallets produce a wonderful soft and shimmering roll on the crash cymbal in the Four Seasons’ “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” (blending with the brass at 0:12+), the intro of the Lovin’ Spoonful’s “Rain on the Roof,” the ending of the Beatles’ “Penny Lane” (blending with the harmonium), The Who’s “Underture” (there shading the acoustic twelve-string guitar), Fleetwood Mac’s “Albatross” (inspiration for the Beatles’ “Sun King”), King Crimson’s “Epitaph” (merging with the Mellotron’s reverb), and the intro to Billy Preston’s “That’s the Way God Planned It” (for colorful interplay with the organ). (Listen to Web audio example 1.13.) Even without a roll, the sticked crash cymbal is often made to blend with other sounds: with the high partials of a muted guitar in the Beatles’ “Girl” (2:00+), and arising out of a shaken tambourine in The Who’s “Sparks” (2:13–2:22).\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 17 Effects of the crash cymbal alone are quite suggestive and are sometimes central to psychedelia; it can suggest a gong in Buddy Knox’s “Ling Ting Tong,” the surf in Jan and Dean’s “Honolulu Lulu” and “Sidewalk Surfin’ ” and in Cream’s “Tales of Brave Ulysses,” and bright sunshine in the Beatles’ “Good Day Sunshine.” Effects are a bit more metaphorical in the syncopated attention-demanding backbeat crashes in the Hollies’ “Stop Stop Stop” and in the clashing “fussing and fighting” cross-rhythms in the Beatles’ “We Can Work It Out.” But probably most often, the crash cymbal is used to mark off one section from another; note how it’s struck every two downbeats only in the bridge of Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs’ “Lil’ Red Riding Hood”—it’s just as important a tool of formal demarcation as Sam’s verse-punctuating wolf howl. As noted earlier, pedaled backbeats and sticked ride patterns are commonly played on the hi-hat. The relentless hi-hat backbeat gives the First Edition’s “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town” a constant, palpable tension that musically embodies the singer’s inner cursing of his impotence. Often, as in the Coasters’ “Three Cool Cats,” the hi-hat will mark every beat while the snare smacks the backbeat; this device can be ornamented, as in the intro to John Fred and His Playboy Band’s “Judy in Disguise (With Glasses),” where the bass drum adds a compelling kick on the “and” of beat one. See regular sticked hi-hat patterns in the Four Seasons’ “Walk Like a Man” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Down on the Corner,” and a syncopated one in Ringo’s mesmerizing hi-hat/toms intro to the Beatles’ “Come Together.” The last-named recording evokes a suspenseful quality strongly associated with the hi-hat, an association also invoked when it is struck when open and subsequently closed, as in Elmer Bernstein’s Theme from “The Man With the Golden Arm” or the oddly derivative “(Theme From) The Monkees.” The open-shut technique can also be ultrafunky, as when the backbeat drums in Wilson Pickett’s “Mustang Sally” are complemented by the offbeat strike on the open hi-hat just before it is closed on fourth beats. Many rhythmic hi-hat patterns are possible: listen to a variety of them in the intros to Donovan’s “Mellow Yellow” and the Beatles’ “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” the second verse of Tiny Tim’s “Tip-toe Thru’ the Tulips With Me,” Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young’s “Our House,” and the verse of Smith’s “Baby It’s You.” The hi-hat contributes great tension to the nervous preparation for the bridge in the Beatles’ “This Boy,” where Ringo taps the closed hi-hat at 0:58–1:02 but opens it strategically for a touch of ringing at 1:00, 1:01, and 1:02. Another imaginative transitional use comes from Dino Danelli in the Rascals’ “It’s Wonderful” (0:37), where the open-and-shut hi-hat seems to signal an abrupt end to the proceedings, granting the ensuing verse a fresh start. The Mothers of Invention focus on a complex rhythm in their satirical “America Drinks,” wherein the hi-hat is struck closed, struck open and then pedaled closed, at\n\n18\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\noblivious rhythmic odds with everything else in an intentionally piss-poor ensemble of vocal, bass, piano, flute, and cymbals. One final topic remains in our introduction to trap-set drumming—the transitional fill, which is a brief ornamented passage used to propel a song from one section into another. The transitional fill also helps mark placement during a recording session in which non-vocal backing tracks may be performed with limited variety, so that a drummer can lead bandmates into and out of sections without their having to rely on each individual’s counting of repeated bars. When the fill occurs in returning from a contrasting passage back to the main section (usually a verse), we’ll refer to it as a retransitional fill. Ringo Starr, especially in his early work with the Beatles, is the master of the form-defining fill. Listen to how, in “I Saw Her Standing There,” he sets up new material, as with the small flam at 0:19 that brings us to the refrain, a more substantial fill moving to the bridge at 0:43, and still wilder retransitions from bridges at 1:09–1:10 and 1:57–1:59. Similar techniques helped put the Beatles on the world map with “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” Ringo was not alone, of course; a dynamic full-bar snare fill leads from the bridge back to a verse at 1:24 in the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.” One widely practiced way to make a transition to verse or chorus sound distinctive was to divide each beat into three—not two—equal parts, so a drummer would work twelve accents (4 × 3) into the time of eight (4 × 2) in a suddenly dramatic bar of quadruple meter. Hear these triplets in Herman’s Hermits’ “Can’t You Hear My Heartbeat” (0:39–0:40), the Dave Clark Five’s “Catch Us If You Can,” Wilson Pickett’s “634–5789” (1:40–1:42), Donovan’s “Mellow Yellow” (0:40–0:44, filling two bars), and the Turtles’ “Happy Together” (0:38–0:39). (Listen to Web audio example 1.14.) An even more disruptive technique would involve simple but strong syncopation not heard elsewhere; this approach brings an exhilarating anarchy to Cream’s “SWLABR” (1:15–1:17) and Steppenwolf ’s “Born to Be Wild” (2:06). In the large scale, a long interior jam often calls for a wild drum climax to call the song’s structure back into being, thus the frenetic retransitional solo by Mitch Mitchell in Hendrix’s “Voodoo Chile.” It is the balance of regular and surprisingly irregular contributions that makes the good rock drummer much more than a timekeeper.\n\nSecondary percussion: Latin hand percussion and larger items Even with a strong drummer at the wheel, extra percussion is heard in all but the sparest rock music. Whether to strengthen the backbeat, double a ride pattern with a contrasting color, or provide an unusual accent, members of a\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 19 battery of more than fifty different available instruments make their appearances one place or another in these songs. Some instruments, like the vibraphone, are available in all studios and heard seemingly everywhere; others, like the vibraslap, seem to be a rare and passing fad. At times, as with the Mothers’ “Help, I’m a Rock” and “Lumpy Gravy” theme, a wide range of percussion played at once betrays modernist orchestral ambitions. Whether played by a free pair of hands during the basic recording or overdubbed later (usually while the vocal parts are taped), whether assigned to whomever happens to be free in the studio or requiring the booking of a mallet specialist from the local philharmonic orchestra, it’s always fun to try to guess which of the dozens of possible add-ons has been trotted out for a particular effect. With a bit of experience, one quickly learns the favorite percussion sounds of particular producers, the specialties of given studios, and the not-really-sointangible qualities that nail a particular style. In our opening chapters, we’ll divide the percussion instruments into two groups. We’ll cover the nonpitched instruments here, as a natural followup to our introduction to the drum kit. Other, pitched, percussion pieces (especially bells and xylophone-type mallet Nonpitched percussion: instruments) chiefly used for their melodic and handclaps . . . harmonic potential will be covered in Chapter 4, along with other orchestral sweeteners, the strings and winds. Frequently, percussion requires no instruments at all. Sometimes it takes no more than an ensemble of handclaps, as in the Marvelettes’ (1)—two— and—(3)—four introductory pattern in “Please Mr. Postman,” to get listeners dancing. Backbeat handclaps are extremely popular right from Wynonie Harris’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight” (1948) to the slightly varied patterns of the 1960s girl groups (though the Supremes often preferred to clap on all beats in their 1964 hits) and the let’s-all-join-in party atmosphere of the Tijuana Brass’s ritual-dance “Zorba the Greek,” Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels’ “Little Latin Lupe Lu,” the Plastic Ono Band’s “Give Peace a Chance,” and the funky shuffle of the Grateful Dead’s “New Speedway Boogie.” Even the Boston Pops Orchestra, in a failed attempt to find the beat in the intro to their cover of “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” resorted to group handclaps, probably earning its members double scale. Fin. . . Shaken items: gers and palms would tap elsewhere, too; perhaps maracas, cabasa, on laps in Buddy Holly’s “Everyday” and persleigh bells, haps on a box in Paul McCartney’s “The Lovely tambourine, castanets, Linda.” Little Willie John’s, and later Peggy Lee’s, slapstick, vibraslap, “Fever” may be the best-known vehicle for fingerwobbleboard . . . snaps, but it’s far from alone; the sound is heard in at least thirty hits of the period, helping suggest\n\n20\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\nsettings ranging from the sparse means of a carefree Roger Miller in “King of the Road” to the abundant riches of the princely Temptations in “My Girl.” Even foot taps (in Janis Joplin’s informal “Mercedez Benz” and Simon and Garfunkel’s elegantly scored “The Boxer,” 0:31+) and stomps (yes, the Four Seasons’ “Walk Like a Man”) have their place. Most nondrummed percussion heard in rock music is from shaken items. Maracas are pairs of shot-filled gourds with handles, once primarily shaken to provide a rumba beat in a Cuban or Puerto Rican band. (Listen to Web audio example 1.15 and see Web photo 1.09.) While they provide a Mariachi flavor in the many hits of the Tijuana Brass and a Brazilian touch to the Critters’ “Mr. Diengly Sad,” maracas are a staple in all 1960s styles, from Lawrence Welk’s “Calcutta” to Elvis Presley’s “(Marie’s the Name) His Latest Flame,” Bob Dylan’s “Obviously 5 Believers,” Ike and Tina Turner’s “River Deep, Mountain High” (2:18–2:46), the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” (2:14–2:56), The Who’s “Sparks” (softening the overall sound at 3:25+), and the intro of the Classic IV’s “Traces.” Interestingly, the maracas don’t seem to appear in top-twenty hits of the 1950s other than the Bell Notes’ “I’ve Had It” and, more influentially, Bo Diddley’s “Say Man” (both of 1959); note the classic Bo Diddley rhythm (ONE—(2)—and—Three—four—(1)—and—two—Three—(4) ) reappearing in the maracas, snare, and bass in Elvis Presley’s “His Latest Flame.” A very close relative of the maracas is the cabasa, a metal shaker around which are strung metal beads; this appears to be the instrument played in Walter Wanderley’s “Summer Samba (So Nice),” David Ruffin’s “My Whole World Ended,” and Chicago Transit Authority’s “I’m a Man.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.16 and see Web photo 1.10.) More jangly are a strap or stick of sleigh bells, which add a seasonal touch in Barry Gordon’s “Nuttin’ for Christmas,” the Beach Boys’ “Little Saint Nick,” and Booker T. and the M.G.s’ “Jingle Bells”; but that also add spice and color to many other Beach Boys tracks including “God Only Knows” (0:09+) and “Pet Sounds,” Marvin Gaye’s “Pretty Little Baby,” the Ronettes’ “Baby I Love You,” and the Beatles’ “Don’t Pass Me By.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.17 and see Web photo 1.11.) The tambourine is the most commonly heard piece of added percussion. It’s really versatile—its small drum head may be struck with the palm, tapped with the fingertips or rubbed with friction to produce a thumb roll, it may be struck on the rim or shaken so its jangles cut through any texture, and any of these techniques may be combined in a variety of rhythms for a busy undercurrent. The headless tambourine is shaken and hit against the fist or wrist. (Listen to Web audio examples 1.18 and 1.19, and see Web photos 1.12 and 1.13.) On occasion, the tambourine makes a lingering ethnic characterization, as in Donovan’s “The Enchanted Gypsy,” “You’ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two” (from Oliver! ), and perhaps also in “I Feel Pretty” (West Side Story). But more typically, it has no such programmatic quality. Because its sharp\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 21 attack and sudden decay can be powerful, it’s sometimes mixed much louder than normally featured forces, drowning out the piano in Barrett Strong’s “Money (That’s What I Want)” and threatening to cover even the voices in Sam and Dave’s “You Don’t Know Like I Know.” A glance at Figure 1.01 shows a sharp rise in the use of the tambourine in top-twenty songs beginning in 1964–65, peaking with its appearance in 41 of 198 hits of 1966. Interestingly, ten of the twelve tambourine-marked 1964 hits entered the Hot 100 in the June–December period. The Beatles’ “Love Me Do,” featuring Ringo on the instrument, was a number-one song in the United States that May; could the wide use of the tambourine in pop music of the late 1960s and beyond be one of the great hidden influences of the early Beatles? As for its use, the tambourine is simply struck on the backbeat in more cases, well over a hundred hits, than all other patterns, shaken or struck, combined. For typical backbeat examples, consider the Miracles’ “The Tracks of My Tears,” the Jefferson Airplane’s “Today,” or most work by the Wrecking Crew of Gold Star Studios for the 5th Dimension. For the heavily delayed backbeat, listen to the Rolling Stones’ most appropriately named “Time Is On My Side.” When struck on every beat, the tambourine can suggest compulsive behavior, as in Napoleon XIV’s “They’re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!” (note the support from bass drum, handclaps, and snare), the bridge of Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” or the chorus of the Grass Roots’ “Temptation Eyes.” When shaken, the tambourine has an ominous quality, suggestive of a rattlesnake’s suspenseful warning in Norman Whitfield’s productions of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” for both Gladys Knight and Marvin Gaye or of a simmering frustration in the Beatles’ “Day Tripper” and Glen Campbell’s “The Universal Soldier.” The shake can come to a snappy stop (the Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville”) or be combined with strikes of various rhythms (a backbeat in Bob Lind’s “Elusive Butterfly”) or with other percussion (backbeat snare and hi-hat in Jr. Walker and the All-Stars’ “What Does It Take”). Note how the tambourine is overlapped and answered by a cymbal tapped at the bell for a color transition in the Beatles’ “In My Life” (0:28–0:46). Frequently, the tambourine can enter late or stop or be played with a different pattern to demarcate a song’s sections; note the various such techniques in the retransition of Dobie Gray’s “The ‘In’ Crowd,” the accompaniment to Larry Knechtel’s tack piano solo in The Mamas and the Papas’ “Dedicated to the One I Love,” the coda of the Association’s “Windy,” the appearance of a second tambourine in the chorus of Diana Ross and the Supremes’ “Reflections” (the first one shaken and a second one struck), and the chorus/verse transition in the Union Gap’s “Lady Willpower.” In fact, the tambourine can so clearly mark section boundaries, its three-second-late entry (0:43) cries out for a retake in Lesley Gore’s “California Nights.”\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n22 25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 1950\n\n1955\n\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\nFigure 1.01. Annual percentage of Billboard’s weekly top-twenty songs with tambourine, 1955–69.\n\nAn instrument with a strong Spanish heritage is the castanets, once a pair of hollowed-out pieces of wood clicked in the hand but now usually mounted for easier play. (Listen to Web audio example 1.20 and see Web photo 1.14.) The Spanish theme runs through Major Lance’s “The Matador,” the Baja Marimba Band’s “Ghost Riders in the Sky” (which opens with a mandolin tremolo) and the Young Rascals’ “Sueño,” but the castanets were also taken over without any cultural context by the Diamonds (“Little Darlin’ ”), Phil Spector (the Crystals’ “Uptown” and “Then He Kissed Me,” Darlene Love’s “A Fine Fine Boy,” and the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby”), and the Beach Boys (“Dance, Dance, Dance,” 0:23–0:26). The variously sized slapstick, which brings together two hinged slats of wood for a loud slap, is heard in Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “Sixteen Tons” and the Beach Boys’ “That’s Not Me.” (Listen to Web audio examples 1.21 and 1.22, and see Web photos 1.15 and 1.16.) The vibraslap, which causes a wood resonator to rattle when a ball attached to it by a steel spring is slapped, is known to me only through three rock songs recorded in Los Angeles within a few months of each other: the Jefferson Airplane’s “Two Heads” (2:24–2:25), Spanky and Our Gang’s “Give a Damn” (0:50), and the Grateful Dead’s “Alligator” (CD remix, 3:21, 3:23, etc.). (Listen to Web audio example 1.23 and see Web photo 1.17.) Another vibrating piece of wood, a panel of masonite about two feet by three that is shaken rhythmically and called of all things the wobbleboard, is the Australian instrument sounding throughout Rolf Harris’s “Tie Me Kangaroo\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 23 Down, Sport,” but which can also be heard in a few British discs including the Yardbirds’ “Hot House of Omagarashid” and The Who’s “A Quick One While He’s Away” (in the cowboy boogie section, “We’ll Soon Be Home”). (Listen to Web audio example 1.24 and see . . . Drums: bongos, conga, Web photo 1.18.) tabla, timbales, orchestral A number of drums are played in addition bass drum, timpani . . . to those in the trap set. Three common types are played by the hands: the Latin bongos and conga, and the Indian tabla. Bongos, two small joined drums of different sizes, were popular in Americanizing the 1950s calypso style, as in Terry Gilkyson’s and the Hilltoppers’ recordings of “Marianne.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.25 and see Web photo 1.19.) In the 1960s, they were adopted by a number of Motown artists (appearing in Mary Wells’s “The One Who Really Loves You,” Marvin Gaye’s “Too Busy Thinking About My Baby,” Stevie Wonder’s “My Cherie Amour”—note the rapid bongo trill in 0:13–0:15, and the Temptations’ “Cloud Nine” among many others), were paired with a nylonstring guitar to add a Latin color to the Beatles’ “And I Love Her,” and added a wild touch to the Yardbirds’ “For Your Love.” The much larger and deeper Cuban conga would typically be slapped by both hands; this gives an airy, gentle quality to both Dionne Warwick’s “Message to Michael” and the Young Rascals’ “Groovin’,” brings to life the beating hearts of Tommy James and the Shondells’ “I Think We’re Alone Now,” and itself is paired with a nylon-string guitar in José Feliciano’s “Light My Fire.” (Listen to Web audio examples 1.26–1.28, and see Web photos 1.20 and 1.21.) The Indian tabla, also a small pair of drums, were not imported into rock music until the Beatles recorded “Love You To,” “Getting Better” and others, but were then quickly adopted by Donovan (in three Sunshine Superman songs that also feature sitar), the Rascals (in “Sattva” and “Stop and Think,” both making use of tamboura as well as sitar and tabla), the Moody Blues (“The Best Way to Travel”), the Association (accompanying the harpsichord-backed bridge in “Windy”), and Led Zeppelin (“Black Mountain Side”). (Listen to Web audio example 1.29, and see Web photo 1.22.) Sticked drums include the brass or steel single-headed timbales (heard panning left— right—left in the opening of Santana’s “Evil Ways”) and the orchestral bass drum (hit with a soft beater, as in Johnny Horton’s “Sink the Bismarck” and Bobby Vee’s “Run to Him,” the former dropping bombs in the intro and the latter ending with a bass drum trill). (Listen to Web audio examples 1.30 and 1.31, and see Web photos 1.23 and 1.24.) Much more rock music employs the timpani, tuned drums whose pitch can be adjusted by a pedal. Made of large copper bowls and also known as kettledrums, they are typically used in pairs or groups, each tuned to a different bass pitch and played with soft beaters. (Listen to Web audio example 1.32 and\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n24\n\nsee Web photos 1.25 and 1.26.) High drama, in Ben E. King’s “I (Who Have Nothing),” Little Anthony and the Imperials’ “Hurt So Bad,” and Tom Jones’s “Daughter of Darkness,” is signaled by the timpani’s dark sounds, which may be made even more ominous in an opening roll, as in the Crests’ “Gee (But I’d Give the World),” Connie Francis’s “Follow the Boys,” and Ronnie Dove’s “I’ll Make All Your Dreams Come True.” (A song also may end with a dramatic timpani roll, as happens in Peaches and Herb’s “Close Your Eyes.”) Timps double for drama and gunshots in Gene Pitney’s “(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance.” A more mysterious atmosphere is created by the free-form timpani rolls, cymbal crashes, and the gradual settling of backing vocalists of uncertain intonation into a recognizable minor key in the opening minute of People’s “I Love You.” An excellent demonstration of the timpani’s dynamic range is heard in Little Peggy March’s “I Wish I Were a Princess” (0:15–0:16). A favorite technique of Brian Wilson’s was to shroud only the timpani in reverb (compare the timps’ sound envelope to that of other instruments in the Beach Boys’ “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” “You Still Believe in Me,” and “Don’t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder).” (Lots of reverb had previously been applied to the timpani and other percussion that opens the Four Seasons’ “Ronnie.”) Owing to its definite pitch, the timpani will often double the bass line (see the Cheers’ “Black Denim Trousers” and the Piltdown Men’s “Brontosaurus Stomp”), or, rarely, take over that role on its own (as in the “looked good . . . looked fine” echoes in Manfred Mann’s “Do Wah Diddy Diddy”). Moreso than other drums, the timpani can have a huge change of pitch while sustaining a single note, when the pedal is depressed before damping a sounding tone; this produces a trombone-like rising or falling glissando effect, put to good use in Neil Sedaka’s “Stairway to Heaven,” Johnny Crawford’s “Cindy’s Birthday,” and Chuck Jackson’s “I Need You.” While other drums cannot produce such a large glissando, a similar effect is sometimes suggested by pressure from the hand . . . Struck items, louder tightening a drum head, and thus raising its pitch eﬀects, metal and wood after it is struck; this technique colors the Moody instruments. Blues’ “The Sun Set.” The hollow woodblock is struck by the stick, perhaps constantly as in Kathy Linden’s “Billy,” or in a ricky-tick vaudeville rhythm, as in The Mamas and the Papas’ “Words of Love,” or in supplying the backbeat, as in the intro and bridge of the Troggs’ “Love Is All Around.” (Listen to Web audio examples 1.33 and 1.34, and see Web photos 1.27 and 1.28.) The two tuned woodblocks simulating a clock in the Safaris’ “Image of a Girl” are actually part of a set of temple blocks (sometimes called Chinese blocks), usually sounding up to five different approximate pitches when struck by a hard rubber mallet. (Listen to Web audio example 1.35 and see Web photo 1.29.) Temple blocks produce a humorous horseclop effect in the Coasters’ “Along Came Jones,” and suggest a mule in Johnny Horton’s “North\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 25 to Alaska” and a camel in Ray Stevens’s “Ahab the Arab.” Their use to accompany a mention of coffee in Oliver’s “Sunday Mornin’ ” is a reference to a stylized percolator in an old Maxwell House ad, and they are used for their sound alone, without references to clocks, coffee or camels, in Bobby Vee’s “Come Back When You Grow Up” and the Beach Boys “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times.” The cowbell, naturally, opens Hugh Masekela’s bucolic “Grazing in the Grass,” but it seldom calls forth such an agrarian quality elsewhere, as when it adds accent to Perry Como’s “Papa Loves Mambo,” Marvin Gaye’s “Stubborn Kind of Fellow,” the Beatles’ “You Can’t Do That” and “Taxman,” the Chambers Brothers’ “Time Has Come Today” (note the heavy reverb on the cowbell), and the Stones’ “Honky Tonk Women.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.36 and see Web photo 1.30.) The anvil makes a number of appearances in rock music—often in work songs such as Sam Cooke’s “Chain Gang,” Jimmy Dean’s “Big Bad John,” and Lee Dorsey’s “Working in the Coal Mine,” in “work” songs such as the 5th Dimension’s “Workin’ On a Groovy Thing,” in a clever simulation of a railroad-crossing bell in the Cheers’ “Black Denim Trousers,” and as a psychopath’s weapon in the Beatles’ “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.37 and see Web photo 1.31.) Louder effects can be made by a wind machine (see Simon Dupree and the Big Sound’s “Kites”), gunshot (heard on second beats of the chorus of Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Boxer”), the lion’s roar (its player pulls a rope through a hole in a suspended metal tub, or pulls his or her hand along the length of a rope attached to the bottom head of a large drum; it appears in the center of the mix of the Mothers of Invention’s “The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet”), and the orchestral siren (opening the Overture to Fiorello! and Janis Ian’s “Younger Generation Blues”). (Listen to Web audio examples 1.38 and 1.39, and see Web photos 1.32 and 1.33.) A few metal percussion instruments remain to be covered. The longresonating Chinese gong or tam tam is the final sound heard on the Moody Blues’ LP, Days of Future Passed, is heard in a number of Dead tracks (it’s struck in “New Potato Caboose” and rolled in “What’s Become of the Baby”), Pink Floyd’s “Sysyphus,” and The Who’s “Underture” (9:58+) and “Overture” (9:58+) both. (Listen to Web audio example 1.40 and see Web photo 1.34.) It has a subtle touch at the end of Donovan’s “To Susan on the West Coast Waiting.” At the opposite extreme are finger cymbals (pairs of tiny cymbals struck together) and crotales (thick brass discs that provide a high definite pitch when struck). (Listen to Web audio examples 1.41 and 1.42, and see Web photos 1.35 and 1.36.) Finger cymbals suggest the Nile valley in Roy Orbison’s “Shahdaroba” and places beyond (?) in the Ran-Dells’ “The Martian Hop”; crotales are heard in the Beatles’ crossfade from “You Never Give Me Your Money” to “Sun King,” and in several pitches in the intro\n\n26\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k to Oliver’s “Good Morning Starshine.” The bell tree, which nestles between fourteen and twenty-six brass bells along a short rod, are scraped by a metal striker in the openings of Sammy Davis Jr.’s “The Shelter of Your Arms” and Petula Clark’s “Kiss Me Goodbye.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.43 and see Web photo 1.37.) The Beach Boys’ “The Warmth of the Sun” is given a shimmering glow by a bell tree at 0:42. Both finger cymbals and the bell tree sparkle brilliantly in Gary Lewis and the Playboys’ “This Diamond Ring” (the former on second beats and the latter on fourth beats, 0:02–0:07). A related but more fragile sound from wind chimes is heard in the opening of the chorus in Simon and Garfunkel’s “At the Zoo,” the Monkees’ “Words,” and in the Grateful Dead’s “That’s It for the Other One” (5:26–5:32 in the CD remix of Anthem of the Sun). (Listen to Web audio example 1.44 and see Web photo 1.38.) Wind chimes are usually numerous metal rods of different lengths suspended within a frame, stroked by a metal striker and damped by the bottom edge of the frame. The simple triangle has wide use, as heard on every other beat two of the instrumental break of the Righteous Brothers’ “(You’re My) Soul and Inspiration” (1:26–1:57), throughout Lesley Gore’s “It’s My Party,” and in a trill-like tremolo over violin harmonics and flute/alto flute duet in the opening of the 5th Dimension’s “Aquarius / Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures).” (Listen to Web audio example 1.45 and see Web photo 1.39.) The ratchety sound of the bicycle bell was first intended to evoke a childhood quality in the Beach Boys’ “You Still Believe In Me” (1:27–1:33), but Brian Wilson’s initial conception of the lyrics changed after the instrument was recorded with the rest of the band so it now offers a more ambiguous meaning. The bicycle bell\n\nPhoto 1.03. Recording the large guiro. Fish guiro and congas are seen to the right. At lower left, the percussionist’s silo holds a wide range of sticks and mallets. (Photo: Annie Eastman)\n\nd r u m s , o t h e r p e r c u s s i o n , a n d a b i t a b o u t r h y t h m 27 is also heard in a pre–“White” Album between-the-tracks passage of gibberish in the Rascals’ “Dave and Eddie.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.46 and see Web photo 1.40.) The bicycle horn, also part of “You Still Believe in Me” (2:16, 2:21), marks the Playmates’ “Beep Beep” and the Tijuana Brass’s “Tijuana Taxi” for rather obvious reasons. (Listen to Web audio example 1.47 and see Web photo 1.41.) Speaking of ratchets, a well-used orchestral instrument that sets a thin tongue of resonant wood vibrating loudly in rapid repetition at the turn of a crank is called just that, a ratchet; it is notable in several song openings: Dion and the Belmonts’ “Kissin’ Game” (along with the triangle), the Four Seasons’ “Ronnie” and the Ventures’ “Hawaii Five-O” (each with drums and timpani), and the Hollies’ “Carrie-Anne.” (Listen to Web audio examples 1.48 and 1.49, and see Web photos 1.42 and 1.43.) A small ratchet is paired with crotales in the Lemon Pipers’ “Green Tambourine,” which also pairs toms with the title instrument. The ratchet marks the second beats of Tommy James and the Shondells’ “Mirage” and “Crimson and Clover” both. Similar to the sound of the ratchet is that of the Latin guiro, originally a multiply notched hollow gourd against which a wooden stick is scraped but nowadays usually formed of plastic. The Cuban guiro is fairly large, whereas the Mexican version is smaller and often painted to resemble a fish. (Listen to Web audio examples 1.50 and 1.51, and see Web photos 1.44 and 1.45.) The guiro is yet another marker of second beats in Dusty Springfield’s “The Look of Love.” It plays a two-beat pattern that remains constant through the second verse of the Grateful Dead’s “Uncle John’s Band,” even when the meter changes from four beats per bar to three. The Drifters’ “Under the Boardwalk” opens with a syncopated pattern featuring the bass on ONE, the guiro on two, and the triangle on four. The guiro accents the Four Seasons’ “Candy Girl” but is heard throughout the Byrds’ “So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star.” A similarly ribbed instrument is the washboard scraped with thimbles or a metal beater, reserved for such jug-band numbers as Country Joe and the Fish’s “I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-to-Die Rag,” the Incredible String Band’s “Big Ted,” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Poorboy Shuffle.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.52 and see Web photo 1.46.) Three more instruments come in pairs. Sandpaper-covered sandblocks are brushed together in Tommy Dorsey’s “Tea for Two Cha-Cha,” Martin Denny’s “Quiet Village” (along with woodblock), Ben E. King’s “Stand By Me” (every second beat, along with triangle, in the opening), Simon and Garfunkel’s “At the Zoo” (fading in and out, 0:48–0:55), and The Doors’ “I Can’t See Your Face in My Mind” (entering with marimbas, 0:31–0:50). (Listen to Web audio example 1.53 and see Web photo 1.47.) Sandblocks come in different sizes, and the pairs of blocks are often covered with mismatched concentrations of grit for a richer texture. The claves are sticks made\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n28\n\nof hard wood (usually rosewood or teak) and clicked together, often in a syncopated Latin pattern, as in Elvis Presley’s “It’s Now or Never” and the Beatles’ “And I Love Her,” but sometimes in a straight backbeat, as in the Drifters’ “On Broadway.” (Listen to Web audio example 1.54 and see Web photo 1.48.) They and a ratchet are used throughout the Strawberry Alarm Clock’s “Barefoot in Baltimore.” Other sorts of rhythm sticks of various tone colors are heard in Annette’s “Tall Paul,” Benny Spellman’s “Fortune Teller” (along with maracas), and The Who’s “Magic Bus.” Bringing us full circle in our paragraphs on added percussion is Petula Clark’s “Round Every Corner,” in which two pairs of rhythm sticks simulate group fingersnaps. (Listen to Web audio example 1.55.) By becoming familiar with representative examples among those cited above, the reader should now be able to recognize all unpitched percussion instruments that appear in popular music of the 1950s and ‘60s. Even so, it still takes great care sometimes to pick out these sources when used in combination, and when they are used to help accent the simultaneous attacks of guitar chords and other forces. Rhythm instruments articulate the music’s foundation, providing the metric framework against which all pitched instruments and vocals find their place even as they create rhythmic matrices of their own. Put in a perhaps more mystical way, rhythm instruments bring the transcendental nature of harmony into our worldly awareness through music’s only dimension, that of time.\n\nCHAPTER \n\nGuitars, the Bass, and an Introduction to Harmony\n\nI\n\nt’s time to add pitch instruments, the carriers of melody and harmony, to the rhythmic foundation we’ve built in chapter 1. In chapter 2, we’ll concentrate on guitars of all types, their amplification, and the wide variety of guitar effects produced by electronic circuits and performance techniques. Although the guitar is no doubt the most familiar of all rock instruments, and the most played by amateur and pro alike, we’ll begin our investigation with the bass. As do the drums with rhythm, the bass defines a song’s underlying harmonic structure. So we’ll cover the basic aspects of harmony as we examine both the acoustic upright string bass and the electric bass guitar.\n\nThe bass If the bass drum is the foundation of the band’s rhythm, the string bass or bass guitar is the band’s pitch foundation. (See Web photos 2.01—2.03.) The pitch is so low that it is felt just as much as heard, and so the bass also plays a rhythmic function, often doubling or slightly ornamenting the bass drum’s 29\n\nt h e f o u n d at i o n s o f r o c k\n\n30\n\npattern. (The bass/bass-drum doubling in a regular pattern is so common, any deviation seems either bizarre, as in the odd third beats of the first verse of the Jeff Beck Group’s “Rock My Plimsoul,” where the two have competing patterns, or quite artistic, as when McCartney’s bass doubles Ringo’s entire kit in an amazingly irregular ten-second duet in the The bass instrument: the Beatles’ “Rain,” 2:24+.) Because of the nature string bass, the electric of acoustics, other pitch instruments—guitars, bass, the keyboard bass, upper keyboard parts, strings, and so on—can and the washtub bass. blend with the upper tones produced by the supportive bass. (This is true when the bass line is played by tuba or bassoon, as well as by a stringed instrument.) Some producers prefer to have the bass blend fully into the ensemble, whereas others will have it stand out from the rest of the mix. Occasionally, the bass will play a melodic or otherwise independent role, thereby demanding a louder voice. The string bass or its electrified counterpart might even have a solo—in an introduction (a string bass opening Roy Orbison’s “Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream),” the electric in Cliff Richard’s “Living Doll”), in a transitional bar or two (string bass at 2:27–2:34 in the Beach Boys’ “I Know There’s an Answer,” electric at 0:52–0:57 in the Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling”), in a verse (string bass in Roger Miller’s “King of the Road,” electric in J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers’ “Last Kiss”), or in an extended improvisation (as in Blind Faith’s “Do What You Like,” Blood, Sweat and Tears’ “Somethin’ Goin’ On,” and Led Zeppelin’s “Good Times Bad Times”). In Blue Cheer’s version of “Summertime Blues,” the bass plays the role of the boss’s authoritative voice that is given words in most all other performances of the song. We’ll first investigate the quality of the bass’s sound, and then describe its function. The stand-up string bass (also called the bass viol) has been for the most part replaced by the much smaller electric bass. The electric’s more focused tone is in most cases easier to record and to balance in live performances than that of the acoustic forebear, but the noisy-up-close string bass is often preferred for its richer sound at a normal listening distance. (Occasionally, as with some Beatles and Motown productions, the electric bass would be cabled directly to the soundboard, bypassing the colorations and distortions of amplifier and microphone, in an attempt to capture the string vibration at its most essential.) The electric bass’s ease of play for a beginner, in that all pitches are fixed by frets on most models and strings are much easier to depress than on the acoustic, combines with its convenient size and ease of sonic control to make it so popular. It should be mentioned that whereas the function of the bass is present in most recordings, this role is sometimes performed by a keyboard, rather than a stringed, instrument. Particularly when four-piece bands would feature a lead singer who did not play an instrument, a keyboardist would often provide the\n\ng u i ta r s , t h e b a s s , a n i n t r o d u c t i o n to h a r m o n y\n\n31\n\nbass line. Thus, Felix Cavaliere of the Young Rascals furnished the bass line on the pedalboard of his Hammond B-3, and when that could not produce the desired effect in the studio (the organ bass lacked the snappy attack of strings), guitarist Gene Cornish would overdub an electric bass part. Similarly, Ray Manzarek of The Doors would typically perch a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass atop his Vox Continental organ. On this, his left hand would supply a bass line on the two-and-a-half-octave Rhodes keyboard while his right hand would comp or play solo lines on the Vox. Led Zeppelin boasted John Paul Jones, a career studio keyboardist who was also competent on the electric bass guitar. In concert, when Jones played electronic keys, he still managed to cover the bass line with his left hand. Generally, only a few pioneering pop and rock recordings were made with an electric bass before 1959; Jackie Brenston’s very early “Rocket ‘88’ ” (1951) is followed by electric-bass hits by Johnny Cash, Little Richard, the Coasters, and Fats Domino. The acoustic and electric instruments, however, enjoyed roughly equal footing in the 1959–63 period. Since 1963, only a handful of holdouts have clung to the string bass in particular styles, and it has enjoyed a new life for occasional sonic effects: it appears in a buzzy imitation of a barber’s “trim” in a few seconds of the Beatles’ “Penny Lane” (2:04–2:09) and is played by an amateur Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones—the bow sounds rosinless—in “Ruby Tuesday.” It should be noted that two jug bands mentioned in chapter 1 for their use of the washboard, Country Joe and the Fish and Creedence Clearwater Revival, also use in these numbers the washtub bass. This is an overturned metal tub against the bottom of which the player stands a broomstick; a waxed string connecting a rim of the resonant tub with the top of the stick is adjusted for tautness—and thus for rising and descending pitch—by pulling and releasing the stick, and is plucked with the free hand. Folk styles often retained the acoustic bass—Bobbie Gentry’s “Ode to Billie Joe,” the Stone Poneys’ “Different Drum,” and Arlo Guthrie’s “Alice’s Rock & Roll Restaurant” feature the string bass in contrasting acoustic environments. But style does not firmly dictate which type of bass is used; the electric is used in some orchestral backings (Bert Kaempfert’s “Red Roses for a Blue Lady,” Paul Mauriat’s “Love Is Blue”), in eighteenth-century styled chamber arrangements (the Cyrkle’s “Please Don’t Ever Leave Me”), and in some styles suggestive of jazz (Friend and Lover’s “Reach Out of the Darkness” and Van Morrison’s “Moondance”).
