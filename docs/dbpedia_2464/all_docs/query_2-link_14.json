I again want to thank Leah Neuberger’s sister, Thelma “Tybie” Sommer, for agreeing after Leah’s death, that I might, in succeeding her as the Association’s Historian, have access to her conscientiously-kept records, letters, photos, newspaper clippings, magazines, and tournament programs from around the world. I want also to thank again Leah and Tybie’s late, longtime friend Bob Green for taking the considerable time and trouble to box up and send to me all this indispensable information.\n\n3\n\nChapter One 1984: USTTA State of Affairs. I began my last volume by saying that 1983 was “a time of upheaval in our Association unparalleled since the 1930’s.” Radical change was the order of the day, week, month, year. As a way of bringing new (and old) readers up to date on the specific disturbing incidents—the repercussions of which continue through 1984 as well—I’m going to start with pertinent excerpts from Bill Hodge’s long article “What Every USTTA Member Should Know” (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 2; 4). As an E.C. member at both public and private meetings, Bill was privy to, and has detailed for us, information that no one else has publicly put forward, or rebutted. This doesn’t mean that you have to take as gospel everything he subjectively says, but you have to believe that I think he wants to tell the truth, and that I think on the whole he’s done a good job of it. As I’ve done in past volumes, when I feel as Historian I’ve a point of view that I upfront want to interpolate into a context—Hodge’s or anyone else’s—I’ve no qualms about doing that; indeed, as the Controlling Intelligence behind these volumes, I feel it’s my job to do it. Here’s much of what Bill wrote to the USTTA members: B.K. Arunkumar Photo by “…I arrived at the Las Vegas Tropicana Hotel the evening of Dec. 11, 1983, and heard that Mal Anderson\n\nthe USTTA E.C. was having a meeting in President Sol Schiff’s room. I called Sol and he said the meeting was almost over and he would see me soon regarding my being named V.P. since I had gotten the most votes of the losing candidates for V.P. in last year’s election. I later found out that the topic of discussion had been Executive Director Bill Haid’s contract and job. Evidently Sol Schiff was unhappy with Haid’s performance the past three years, and they were now discussing whether to fire him, and who his replacement might be. It should be pointed out that Haid’s contract has NEVER been signed! He has a contract, but Sol never signed it—therefore Haid never had any protection, and could be let go at a moment’s notice. It was decided at this meeting that within two days Sol would tell Haid that the E.C. was dissatisfied with his performance, and was looking at Bob Tretheway, the National Coaching Chairman, as a possible replacement. It should be further pointed out that Haid was never officially notified during the next week [the Tropicana U.S. Bill Haid, Closed ran from Dec. 16-19] of the above actions. Finally, Monday USTTA Executive Director 4\n\nmorning, Dec. 20, 1983, Sol told Haid he must raise $30,000 by June 1, 1984 or he would have no 1984/1985 contract. Schiff stated the USTTA was approximately $30,000 in debt, so Haid must raise the money or be fired. That Monday morning, the Winter E.C. Meeting begins. Item 4 of the Agenda is Filling of Vacancies. Schiff names Jimmy McClure to replace Pat O’Neill who had resigned. This was voted on and approved, so McClure was a new V.P. (The U.S. Closed Program had already listed him as V.P.) Next Sol nominates me to replace Stan Robens who had resigned. The E.C. requested that I leave the room while they had a discussion. It turned out they were discussing their fear that I would only serve out Robens’s term to May 31, 1984 and then not run again. [This E.C. really, really wanted Bill on their Board and hoped in the coming Jimmy McClure election he’d be elected? Schiff in his Campaign Statement will say, “For Vice-President I would recommend either D.J. Lee or Bill Hodge, and then hope for the best”—not exactly a ringing endorsement.] I assured them that I intended on running, so I was voted in as a V.P. and I immediately went to work. [Hodge decides that in his presentation here it’s best to go back to the June, 1981 E.C. meeting and with pertinent comments on E.C. meetings thereafter work up to the Dec., 1983 meeting he attended.] June, 1981: …Disciplinary Report criticized by E.C. Schiff promised to seek more details, but according to the next Minutes he did not. [What was the nature of this Disciplinary Report? Why did the E.C. criticize it? As we’ve subsequently seen, Schiff and Disciplinary Reports may not be in sync. Note particularly the Schiff/Rufford Harrison vs. Scott Boggan/Tim Boggan firestorm (Vol. XII, 414-422]. ITTF passed a rule that ITTF Officers may not be in the Equipment Business. [That goes for USTTA officers too?] Since that time several E.C. members have been in the Equipment business. Most notable are D.J. Lee and Sol Schiff. Sol states that he has given up his business, yet he has been, and is currently, listed in SPIN in the Equipment section under “Mr. Table Tennis” with his address and phone number. TV: No report. No appointment. I would think that TV would be our best potential for making big money, and making the public aware of our sport…. Haid proposed that 8.8.16.12 be deleted. This read: ‘All contracts approved by the E.C. will be printed in the National Publication.’ Why delete it? [Because it’s not practical to use space in the magazine for contract after contract which reader after reader won’t read?]…This delete proposal was passed…. C.F. Liu proposed that all contracts be sent to the E.C. prior to signing. This was an approved Bylaw change and is now (Dec., 1983) supposed to be in effect, but is not being done, and Sol Schiff is controlling the contracts, and all of the E.C. members are not seeing them. In some cases, none of them are….Cases in point are Bill Haid’s contract, along with the Dorset Gant/Bill Addison Video East fiasco; the Perry County Cheese [Pizza] contract; the U.S. Open and Closed contracts with the Tropicana Hotel; Tom Wintrich’s SPIN contract; the Melia Travel contract; Sportcase Productions contract; USOC contract; Robbins’ Uniforms contract; Tamasu/ Henan Li Ai contract; and the Manufacturers contract are a few [sic: huh? 5\n\nthere are many more?]. Personally I would LOVE to see all of the above—but all I have seen is Haid’s unsigned one. Executive Director’s contract amended by 10% raise, plus insurance is paid for, and there’s a bonus. Dec., 1981: Lyle Thiem appointed Treasurer. Disciplinary Report. Schiff reported he had not sought details missing from Committee Report. [What’s the nature of this Report? Why is Schiff not following up? The devil’s in the details?]… Schiff reported that the Executive Director contract had been signed. [By who?] Executive Action: TV contract signed with Sportcast Productions by Schiff and Gus Kennedy after Harrison refused to sign. [Why didn’t Harrison want to sign?] Contract subsequently cancelled by Sportcast. [Why?] Thus no TV of 1981 U.S. Closed. Harrison questioned how allocation of Olympic funds had been decided. Schiff stated that since USTTA allocation increased after meeting at Baden-Baden, there wasn’t adequate time to submit the matter to the E.C. and he had it handled by a USTTA Delegate. [Who handled this “matter” and how?] Schiff noted that too much reliance is placed on USOTC funding. Schiff believes that Equipment Approval fees are inadequate ($20,000 a year)…. July, 1982: Auditor drew attention to balance of $1,900 compared with $41,700 in 1980…. The Executive Director’s contract was revised and accepted, and was to be put in final form by Bowie Martin and Haid. Dec., 1982: Schiff says long-time Disciplinary Chair Dr. Michael Scott is out and Wendell Dillon is in. [This abrupt change after many years is the result of a stand-off, not-gonnadiscipline-either-one decision Dr. Scott made when Rufford Harrison took Scott Boggan for embarrassingly poor judgment as a U.S. Team member to the Disciplinary Committee, and Tim Boggan, armed with 18 single-spaced pages of rebuttal and accusations, took Schiff-surrogate Harrison for ethical violations of his office to the Whadda you want from me? I made a balanced decision. Disciplinary Committee (Vol. XII, 414Photo by Steve Holland 422)….] Regarding a revision of the Executive Director’s contract: Martin signed and now Schiff has. [Whoa. Hodge said in the second paragraph of his opening above that as of mid-Dec., 1983 Schiff NEVER signed this Haid contract. Does he say here that Schiff merely has a copy of the contract— has [it?—the “it” left out]. Or does he say that Schiff too has said he’s signed the contract but really hasn’t?] …Robens, Haid, and Kennedy engage in fund-raising problems. Robens quits, then returns…. Disciplinary Committee matters involving Scott Boggan and also Martin Doss deferred. 6\n\nLarge file’s accumulated regarding Coaching Committee and Wang Fuzheng, the $15,000 Chinese Coach [who visited various USTTA clubs and with help (since he himself did not speak English) conducted coaching clinics] …. Schiff proposes Bylaw change to delete 8.7.5.1 which calls for Executive V.P. [Gus Kennedy was currently in office] to succeed to Presidency in case of vacancy. Instead, Schiff wants the E.C. by majority vote to appoint one of its members [Sol has someone Coach Wang Fuzheng: in mind?]. Defeated. Whadda you want from me? Photo by Mal Anderson Replace Carr as Nominating Chairman? Schiff USTTA Executive Vice deferred. President Gus Kennedy Regarding the June 1, 1982 Budget: USTTA lost $4,000. Income $151,000. Outgo $155,000. USTTA has $69,000 in Bank. For the 1982 U.S. Closed, Schiff approved Rey Domingo eligible to play, although Rey didn’t fulfill the Green Card requirements. Schiff stated it was an “Emergency Decision.” Now, after discussion, Schiff tells Andy Gad to call Domingo and tell him he can’t play in the tournament. This brought up B.K. Arunkumar’s eligibility, so he can’t play either, so Haid must call him. Haid returns and says Arunkumar stated that Schiff told him he could play. Sol denied this. Said he would take the recommendation of the committee—which said Arunkumar was ineligible. This brought up the eligibility of Mr. Kim’s Korean team from L.A. Sol told Haid to call Kim regarding his players’ eligibility. Mr. Kim tells Haid that Sol Schiff said his players could play. Schiff denies it. Mr. Kim is very, very upset with Schiff and the USTTA. [These denials remind me of how Mike Bush said he was told by Schiff that he and Scott Boggan would be able to play in the May, 1981 Swiss Open and when they got all the way there, the Swiss said they had no idea they were coming and, no, they weren’t welcome (Vol. XI, 13-14).] Pat O’Neill says E. C. members should appoint and fire the Committee Chairmen who report to them, instead of it all being done by Schiff. Bill Addison on TV coverage at the 1982 U.S. Closed: he’ll tape a show and ESPN will broadcast it in Feb., 1983. There’ll be six ad spots per 30 minutes of TV….The USTTA is to spend approximately $25,000 and get $30,000 in return. Instead, USTTA loses its money, then is sued by Addison for $9,000—of which $3,000 has been 7\n\npaid. [Triple T Enterprises, with whom the USTTA was doing business, consisted of independent contractor/ promoter Dorsett Gant and TV producer Bill Addison.]\n\nOlympic Sports Center\n\nBowie Martin is resigning. Stan Robens is resigning. And Dr. Liu may not run for re-election…. Schiff wants Danny Robbins to replace Larry Thoman as Coaching Chair, but Pat O’Neill says Robbins can’t do the job. Liu is down on Schiff— says Thoman has been mistreated. Olympic Headquarters [As we’ve seen (Vol. XII, 232-238), Larry himself is very unhappy with Haid who’d had him removed from his Coaching Chair (so that Bob USTTA Coaching Tretheway could come to Colorado Springs to replace him). Larry’s also so Chair Bob Tretheway distraught with Schiff over the lies Sol has publicly told about him that he’s quitting the Sport and won’t come back unless Schiff loses the upcoming Presidential election to Boggan.]… June, 1983: O’Neill [who was chairing a committee to re-organize the USTTA E.C.] had no proposals for restructuring since no E.C. member had replied to the questions in his Planning Guide. [He’ll be resigning.] Haid reports he had not circulated copies of his Contract to the E.C. since he had never received a signed copy [so I presume Schiff had NOT signed such a contract—though why not?]. Haid reported that he had changed officials at the National Sports Festival as follows: Communications—Tom Wintrich (instead of Boggan who’d not been officially informed of the change) and Dennis Masters (instead of Danny Robbins who’d not been officially informed of the change). [Boggan had come to this Summer E.C. meeting uninvited and very angry at the way he’d been fired without so much as a word or scrap of paper after 13 years of service as Editor of Topics –“Never in my life have I been treated so badly!” he said. “How you must hate Old USTTA Editor New USTTA Editor or fear me!” [XII, 208-225]. Tim was Tim Boggan Tom Wintrich so disgusted, so mad that he was to Photo by Mal Anderson 8\n\nstart his own tabloid, Timmy’s, in opposition to SPIN, the new name of the Tom Wintrich-edited USTTA newspaper. Then, when Schiff began lying in print that Boggan had fired himself because he’d gotten angry, he wrote a public rebuttal and resolved to try to wrest the Presidency, now so corrupt, away from Schiff.] Schiff [in a fait accompli] had authorized the move of Wintrich from Albuquerque to Colorado Springs at a cost of $1,400 out of the Headquarters account, and Schiff also approved payment of $1,000 per month to Wintrich. Tom stated he would spend about 60% of his time on SPIN and 40% on duties at Headquarters. Six months later, he would amend the figures to 90%/10%. Schiff’s Executive action regarding Wintrich had not been reported either to the Treasurer or to a number of other E.C. members. [At the June, 1983 E.C. meeting when Boggan, upset, first arrived, there was no dissent from the fait accompli Schiff, given the support and encouragement of Bill Haid and Pat O’Neill, had engineered. But the next day…] Results of Secret Ballot proposed by Mel Eisner was Wintrich 4 and Boggan 3. Boggan out, Wintrich in. …Kennedy instructed to inform old Coaching Chair Larry Thoman and new Coaching Chair Bob Tretheway of the change. [Kennedy’s letter went unforwarded to an old Thoman address and, though it was said Tretheway had informed Thoman, the delay in receiving official word that he’d been replaced further disturbed Larry.] Jack Carr offered to resign his pro-tem Nominating Chair as of Jan. 1, 1984. As a replacement for Carr, Schiff names Mal Anderson—[though even into the March, 1984 issue of SPIN, the USTTA Register continues to list Carr as the Nominating Chair]. It was agreed that Alice Green be excused from attendance at the Pan Am Camp because of a work commitment. This was the beginning of the USTTA’s problems with the USOC regarding RULES, GRIEVANCE, and SELECTION METHOD. It precipitated a Kasia Dawidowicz Gaca Grievance, and a Green threat of suit against the USTTA if she is removed from the U.S.Team. Dec., 1983: [This brings Hodge’s summary back to where he started—the Dec., 1983 E.C. Meeting in Las Vegas.]…I repeatedly asked Schiff what the Gaca Grievance was, and three times was put off. This item was deferred….[Schiff, in matters large and small, is repeatedly showing a pattern of evasion and inaction.] [Hodge later explains:] The Gaca complaint involves her right to compete on the 1983 U.S. Pan Am Team and an alleged denial by USTTA of her right to participate on that Team. There are two things that are readily apparent. 1. The USTTA had filed with the USOC a Team Selection method which was approved. It stated training sessions would be mandatory and all members were required to participate in Bill Hodge at work both camps. Two athletes, Alice Green and Sheila Photo by Mal Anderson O’Dougherty (who was named to the USOC Athlete Advisory Board by the EC), did not abide by the rules established for participation in the training camps. Alice Green was excused from one camp and Sheila missed parts of both camps. Kasia Gaca attended both camps as the #1 Alternate. In spite of the established rules, Alice and Sheila remain Pan Am members and Gaca has been denied the right to participate on the Team. 9\n\n2. When Mrs. Gaca attempted to file a grievance, it was determined that the USTTA has no rules or procedures available to an athlete to file a complaint. There also is no rule providing the prompt and equitable resolution of grievances by the Kasia Dawidowicz Gaca Photo by Neal Fox USTTA. Additionally, I have a question as to whether athletes are appropriately represented in all phases of USTTA activities as is required by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 and USOC Constitution and Bylaws. [Hodge will end this summary with USOC Executive Director F. Don Miller’s angry letters to Schiff who’d been ignoring his requests that an Internal Grievance Procedure be put into our Bylaws. Bill will soon elaborate on those Miller letters and Schiff’s reluctance to respond to them . At the moment he warns:] WE ARE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY OF LOSING USOC FUNDING, FACILITIES, AND NAME ASSOCIATION…. [Hodge continues with other items of interest at that Dec., 1983 Meeting:] The 1984 U.S. Open and U.S. Closed contracts (including proposed sites and dates) that were expected to be signed at this meeting by Schiff were not signed…. Haid reports that the USTTA has 6,291 members— including Universities, Businesses SPIN only, etc. There are 3, 944 paid members. The Budget for Headquarters is $68,000…. Pat O’Neill and USTTA Legal Advisor Rex Burlisson commented on Addison’s suit against the USTTA for $9,000— $3,000 of which had been paid. There would be no action against Addison, as it would be hard to collect since he was broke. [If we think we ought to get money from TV man Addison, why did we pay him $3,000, and do we intend to pay him $6,000 more?] Burlisson said [with regard to the TV debacle] we were not covered by insurance. He also said he would attempt to get our 32 Video tapes back from Gant, who is selling them on the open market. [Later, a Minutes entry says, “Settlement achieved with Dorsett Gant.” What specifically was that?]… …I was responsible for, and deserve credit for, getting the Dorsett Gant $48,900 into the Budget for the ATHLETES, and not for Photo by Mal Anderson HEADQUARTERS, or other USTTA expenses. [To do this Bill had somehow to have the Budget balanced:] …Everyone said it was absolutely impossible to balance the Budget. It was six months past due, and now the USOC money was mostly being used for USTTA items such as Headquarters, U.S. Open and Closed, National Publication, etc….I attempted to explain to the E.C. members how we could do it. They said it was impossible. I insisted it could be done, so they told me to leave the room, work on it by myself in silence and see what I could do. I went to Dick Evans’s room, worked on it for 90 minutes, and returned to the E.C. meeting with a balanced budget and now with the $48,900 all for the athletes….In the February, 1984 issue of SPIN, Rufford Harrison states, “We really do have a budget…and it was 10\n\nonly through the efforts of the newest member of the E.C. that we were able to balance it, six months into the fiscal year. It was Bill Hodge who did it. He deserves your vote in this election….” Regarding the new Tournament Operations Committee—who’ll be the Chair? Evans declined.…I repeatedly stated I wanted the Chair, but Schiff kept putting me off saying that Dan Simon and Dennis Masters were Co-Chairing the U.S. Closed and he was considering them for the Committee. [They would later be appointed.] Sol finally promised we would vote on the Chair Sunday night. After the tournament Sunday night I asked him about the vote, and he wouldn’t discuss it…. Regarding signature(s) on USTTA checks: I believe the Treasurer signs with one other person. Who?... A new Bylaw has to do with a Code of Conduct. I never saw a copy of it, or heard of a vote…. The USTTA will deduct 15% of money awards to Amateurs, but will give back 5-10% in travel allowance…. A contract was signed with Tamasu. He had a chance to equal any other show of interest and offered 20% more than he did last year. Wasn’t there a contract with Robbins regarding U.S. Team uniforms?... It was agreed, at a meeting in Sol’s room on Dec. 15, that Dick and Sue Butler’s Junior Development Group will be a Committee of USTTA, not a separate organization….During this meeting Schiff said publicly he had decided not to run for President…. Added to Minutes by Harrison—Length of term of office of EC members. When this was brought up, Schiff said, “I think we should run for 10 terms.” [Were he to win the upcoming election, and serve out another term, that would make him the USTTA President for 10 straight years.] Everyone laughed and he said, “I’m serious, go ahead and put it in the Minutes.” We then went on to other topics. ….The Most Important Topic of this Article follows: On Aug. 2, 1983, the Executive Director of the USOC, Col. F. Don Miller, wrote Sol Schiff a very important letter with a request that it be answered promptly, but no later than Sept. 1, 1983….Since this letter went unanswered, on Nov. 1, 1983 Col. Miller wrote Schiff another letter that said: ‘Dear Sol: I have noted with some concern that you have not responded to my 8/2/83letter in which I listed four areas of concern. Those are as follows: 1. The Application by USTTA of Pan Am or Olympic team selection procedures to the actual selection of the team members. 2. The right of fair notice and hearing procedures being provided an athlete by USTTA before ruling on the athlete’s eligibility to compete in Pan Am or Olympic competition. 3. The provisions of the USTTA Constitution for procedures for prompt and equitable resolution of grievances filed by an athlete. 4. The degree of athlete representation in the USTTA in accordance with the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, and US Olympic Comm. Constitution. I am gravely distressed that the USTTA has not responded to the inquiries which I have made. This is one of the most serious issues that the USOC may raise with one of its Members. Your lack of response with regard to my previous inquiry appears to show a disregard for the 11\n\nimportance of the issues raised. If I do not receive a prompt response to this letter and that of 8/2/ 83, I shall be forced to pursue other avenues with regard to these most important issues. With all best wishes, I remain, Sincerely, F. Don Miller’ On Nov. 4, 1983, Bill Haid sent to the USOTC an informal Grievance Procedure for inclusion into the USTTA Bylaws as requested by Col. Miller. On Nov. 27, 1983 [or Nov. 17, 1983?], Haid sent a letter to Schiff reminding him he had not responded to Col. Miller’s letters, and that Miller’s [last] letter is ‘probably more serious than you may realize. Failure to acknowledge Col. Miller’s request on time may be taken as an admission of the USTTA not wishing to comply with the rules. This could seriously jeopardize the license of the USTTA with the USOC. Also in jeopardy could be the $48,900 allocation of money. To be considered in replying to Col. Miller is the fact that we are making a concentrated effort to put the Grievance Bylaws into our Constitution, to have an athlete on our Board of Directors, and to clarify the Pan Am selection procedure.’ Jan.-Feb., 1984: after the Dec., 1983 Meeting, on Jan. 10, 1984, Haid sent a letter to the E.C. stating, ‘The extreme delay in answering Col. Miller’s request has put the USTTA into a perilous position.’ This letter went on to outline again what must be done, and also the consequences the USOC might put on our Sport. The importance of the four points Col. Miller raises is obvious. But more important is how Sol Schiff has ignored a man of Col. Miller’s importance. The USOC is VITAL—is CRITICAL to our Budget, our growth, and to our credibility. This situation must be dealt with before it is too late—or is it already too late? …Paul Therrio, who used to be the USTTA Treasurer and lived in Colorado Springs while he was the Olympic delegate, has confirmed with his friends in high places at the USOC that the USTTA is in deep trouble with the USOC. I’d also heard that Sol Schiff told Col. Miller off [in a mailed note? over the phone? not to Col. Miller himself, but to another person—Haid? in a harangue just to self?) after the Nov. 17, 1983 [or Nov. 27, 1983?] letter Bill had written. Schiff has been quoted as saying we don’t need Olympic money. In Jan., 1984, Schiff told Harrison to write to Col. Miller. In Feb., 1984, a letter was finally sent to Col. Miller with Schiff’s signature saying the USTTA would have a mail vote regarding the four important subjects in Col. Miller’s letter.” Here is Recording Secretary Rufford Harrison’s summary of the Dec., 1983 E.C. Minutes (SPIN, March, 1984, 11):\n\nFormer USTTA Olympic Delegate Paul Therrio\n\nAfter two recent resignations, the E.C. was brought back up to strength at this meeting. Jimmy McClure replaced Pat O’Neill and Bill Hodge replaced Stan Robens. A great deal of time was spent at this meeting on financial matters, notably the great expense associated with Headquarters operations, and the legal matters arising from the 1982 U.S. Closed 12\n\nChampionships. Headquarters operations were to be discussed further after the meeting proper, and therefore do not appear in detail in the Minutes. Legal matters were also to be pursued further, in the hope of recouping some of the funds already paid out on debts incurred by our television chairman. The budget was finally balanced, however. [Readers, continue learning things about your Association.] Several tournament matters were discussed, including a simplification of the playing permit procedure. Permits will now cost $5.00 each, an increase, but there is no limit to the number that may be purchased before a player must join the USTTA. This reduces the need for record keeping. It will be noted that juniors should never purchase a permit, since a junior membership without the national publication is only $3.00. In the absence of other suitable sites it was agreed to hold the 1984 U.S. Open and U.S. Closed at the Vegas Tropicana. [Don Gunn voices reservations about the Tropicana’s 50 tables that entries have played on and will play on again this year. He says: “Frankly, fellas, they need work. Somewhere during use, storage, or moving, many have lost their rubber feet, and some have surface gouges. With sufficient inducement, almost anyone could put all the feet on with some semblance of permanence, if replacements can be obtained by Tamasu. As for the gouges…?”] Hospitality for foreign teams cannot be provided, other than rooms for the Canadian and U.S. teams. The dates of the U.S. Open are in conflict with those of the table tennis competition of the Wheel Chair Olympics in Champaign, IL. Officials for the latter event might be more difficult to find than those for our Open. Anyone interested should contact Mike LoRusso. (See USTTA Register, page 3.) Cancellation of tournaments at the last minute have proved a great burden on the Tournament Committee and the Ratings Chairman. It was agreed to levy a moderate assessment for such occurrences. Another source of problems has been the continuing differences between the Canadian and U.S. rating systems, which has caused inequities in the classification of players in tournaments. The American and Canadian ratings chairmen will meet to resolve this problem. Disabled Committee Chair The possibilities of clinics for tournament officials at the Mike LoRusso U.S. Olympic Training Center was discussed and it was agreed to arrange at least one. It was also agreed to form within the USTTA a Players’ Committee similar to the USOC’s Athletes’ Advisory Committee. [I’ve no record of such a Players’ Committee ever having been formed.] Anyone who needs to see the complete Minutes may do so at their local affiliated club [on this or that wall, or in a control-desk drawer or wastebasket—locations vary, act quickly], or if a personal copy is desired, mail a stamped self-addressed envelope to Headquarters….” Actually, Rufford is saving some Minutes substance for his own rhetorical purposes—to support his candidacy for Recording Secretary in the upcoming election. His aim in his Campaign Statement (SPIN, Feb., 1984, 19) is to distance himself from the E.C. body, and champion himself as the “financial watchdog” of the Association: “Yes, I’m running for office again, but unfortunately not for the right reasons. I’d like to be able to say that I was so enraptured by this lively, innovative, forward-moving, well-managed 13\n\norganization that I wanted to be a continuing part of it. The problem is that we are not lively or innovative; we haven’t moved far forward since that last major step of getting into the USOC; and we are certainly not well-managed. [So who’s to blame for that? The President? You? Certain others? The buck stops where? Who’s held accountable?] It is on that last point that I feel most strongly. The E.C. is completely irresponsible fiscally. [And why’s that?] I want to stay on it to make sure that there is at least one voice interested in protecting the membership’s investment. [You mean in addition to Bill Hodge’s?] Let me illustrate: For the U.S. Closed in 1982 we worked with a TV promoter and struck a deal with quite low chances of success; it cost us money. [Who’s “we”? Who’s to blame for this poor judgment?] Until the 1983 summer meeting, all that the E.C. heard was vague, yet by that time we were already paying out more than a thousand dollars a month to settle the debts that our unethical promoter had incurred on our behalf. No one thought it important enough to tell the EC about this.[Who should have told the EC about this? Meanwhile, the President, the Treasurer, You, the other E.C. members were just blind to these accumulated debts, this monthly outlay?] We have recently negotiated a $9,000 settlement. Another example: With all respects to Tom Wintrich, who undoubtedly did not know the entire situation [Undoubtedly? WHAT did Tom, moving to Colorado Springs, not know?]. He was moved from Pittsburgh [Albuquerque?] to Colorado Springs and was paid $1,000 per month—for what? The EC couldn’t possibly know, since not even the Treasurer had been told. [Well, who the hell knew? Schiff? O’Neill? Haid? Who thought up this move? Who authorized this expenditure? Are you defending it? Are you attacking it? The buck of responsibility stops where?] We all—well, not quite all, since one of us had obviously consummated the deal [and who do you think that was?]—found out about it during the summer meeting, after Tom had been at Headquarters for a month. Then we conducted the entire summer meeting without the benefit of a budget. [Is line after line of this Campaign Statement a confession?] Can’t have a budget, says the Treasurer, if we don’t yet know how much each committee wants for the coming year. Yet we spent two days blithely passing legislation involving thousands of dollars, some of which we undoubtedly did not have. I submit that, if a committee chair does not submit his own proposed budget, we should either replace him or else tell him what he may spend. [Most people would say that, yes.] Some time after the meeting we did receive an approved budget, but it showed a deficit that, after two years in the red, is a luxury that we cannot afford. [Most people would say that, yes.] It would be helpful to compare that budget with the Treasurer’s report, but that was virtually impossible since the line items of each did not match. You should already know about that, of course, since both documents should have been printed in the national magazine. Alas, contrary to the Bylaws, they were not. [Alas, why in the world are you writing all this, Rufford? This admission of ineffectualness is calculated to get you ELECTED?] After all that, perhaps you will not be surprised to read that, until recently, the EC was not receiving succinct, periodic statements of our financial status, comparing it with the budget. I had to request this several times over a year and a half. [But nobody paid any USTTA attention to you. Why was that? Who should have replied to your Recording Secretary requests?] Raising money is difficult, but finding out about money is Rufford Harrison 14\n\nalmost impossible in this Association. [So what you need is: not Schiff but a new President? A new Treasurer? Need to replace E.C. members, including you?] We finally do have a budget, by the way, and it was only through the efforts of the newest member of the EC that we were able to balance it, six months into the fiscal year. It was Bill Hodge who did it. He deserves your vote in this election. I suppose I should talk, if briefly, about the office I’m running for, Secretary. Most of you can’t tell how I perform [well, you’ve certainly been doing your best to tell us], since you don’t see the Minutes I produce [we saw the ones above], or the agenda, or all the follow-up papers. Some of you do, and you know that the Minutes are complete and timely, and that the follow-up is prompt. [You mean from seeing those few paragraphs above about the Dec. meeting that appeared in the Mar. issue of SPIN?] It isn’t quite as easy as it used to be for EC members to default on promised action. But that isn’t why you should vote for me. You need someone on the E.C. who has realized how precarious our position is, and who will serve as a watchdog to ensure that we don’t approach any closer to bankruptcy. [Suddenly an epiphany, in the darkness an alert bark!] One final point: There are those who think that our state of near-anarchy is due to Sol Schiff. [Who could think that?] It isn’t. Sol is as concerned about these problems as I am. [You’re certainly political bedfellows—there’s no doubt about that.] If you are looking for perfection [no, just a caring competence], I suggest you try another sport. You won’t find perfection in any of us, and certainly not in Sol’s opponent. Unless you want your Association to be even less less-governed than it is now, I strongly urge you to vote for Sol Schiff. ” Jack Carr (Timmy’s, Jan., 1984, 14) says that, like Boggan and Thoman, he’s angry too, and wants you to vote for Tim Boggan in the upcoming election, not Sol Schiff. He writes: “Even though I resigned many months ago, until recently I was the Nominating Committee Chairman. [Resigned? If you functioned as the Nominating Chair, weren’t you the Chair?] I continued to serve until a relief [Mal Anderson] was finally found. Because of that [because Carr was himself on the Nominating Committee and didn’t resign soon enough] the E.C.— Jack Carr Sol Schiff and Rufford Harrison particularly—would not Photo by Mal Anderson accept the Nominating Committee’s proposal of me as Executive Vice-President.” [Jack says the lie that he as Nominating Chair had voted for himself influenced other E.C. members to vote against him.]… I can understand Sol Schiff and Rufford Harrison’s animosity and desire to strike back at me when the Nominating Committee did not approve either of them as candidates for the upcoming election….According to the E.C. it was alright for the previous Nominating Committee Chair Barry Margolius to serve on the E.C. during the time he was Nominating Committee Chair. Now all of a sudden the E.C. says I’m not qualified. [To have what appear to be rival committees decide, on the one hand, that Schiff and Harrison can’t run, and on the other, that Carr can’t, when all three have served the USTTA for decades, seems to me unjust. We’re not talking about voting for them, we’re talking about letting them run for office then objecting to or supporting them. Is the Nominating 15\n\nCommittee—are its members the same as last year’s: Dave Cox, Dick Feuerstein, Bill Haid, and Dr. Michael Scott?—too severely limited in its choices?]… I am informed that at the [Dec., 1983] E.C. meeting Sol Schiff was added as a candidate for President to run unopposed. Gus Kennedy was approved for Executive Vice-President to run unopposed, after I was refused Also, the E.C. replaced Bob Partridge with Rufford Harrison. [Of course, several others vying for office were accepted, so at voting time no one was running unopposed.]… In my Former Long Island TTA opinion and that of President Dave Cox some other recent E.C. members and committee chairmen, at this time Sol Schiff has outserved his usefulness. This is unfortunate when I recall the fine job Sol did during his first term in office. Four to six years ago Sol was an excellent President. He didn’t make ‘emergency decisions’ when there was no emergency, didn’t violate the Bylaws, and didn’t overrule E.C. decisions. At that time I would have supported him against almost anyone. Now I would support almost anyone against him. Sol used to be a team member instead of King Solomon. He was cooperative, helpful, sincere, honest, unselfish, cordial, considerate, dedicated, and self-sacrificing. A former E.C. Vice President wrote to me that we were extremely fortunate to have Sol Schiff as President. I agreed with him fully at the time, but regrettably we no longer feel that way. It’s too bad that Sol has changed, possibly caused by the pressure of the office; maybe the number of consecutive terms as President should be limited.” As we just read in a Carr paragraph above, the E.C. did not accept the Nominating Committee’s choice of Bob Partridge to run for Recording Secretary—replaced him with Rufford Harrison. I think this would have surprised Manny Moskowitz for one, since he had this to say about Bob in his Jan., 1984 Umpire’s Chair article (Timmy’s, 21): “Bob Partridge of Lafayette, CA is to be commended on his job as Chief Umpire at the U.S. Closed just concluded in Las Vegas. Bob capably assigned umpires for the six feature tables, which were 16\n\nU.S. Closed Chief Umpire Bob Partridge\n\nconstantly rotating matches in Men’s and Women’s Singles due to the round- robin format being used to determine qualifiers for U.S. Team representation in the year ahead. Many of the umpires were called upon frequently, and without their cooperation I am sure there would have been delays and problems. In addition, Bob managed to meet the demands for umpires when requested by other players on the remaining 42 tables….” Carl Danner, who himself is running for office in this spring’s E.C. election, writes the following Letter to the Editor (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 3): “One of my Campaign issues is Openness and Accountability in our USTTA government. In that vein, I would like a public explanation of how Bob Partridge was replaced by Rufford Harrison on the Recording Secretary ballot. Partridge is a talented worker and promoter who was one of three candidates nominated by the Nominating Committee. Harrison, the incumbent (and a current E.C. member) was substituted for Partridge by the E.C. during the Winter Meeting in Las Vegas. However, the Minutes of that Meeting (which are Harrison’s responsibility to compile) have yet to appear in SPIN. [They will appear (as we saw above) in very abbreviated form in the March issue.] Why was Partridge (in my view the best qualified of the three who were nominated) the one replaced? I would like to know who it was that exercised that judgement; it was poor.” Poor Rufford—can’t something positive come his way? Yes! Here’s SPIN’S “Harrison Dines at the White House” article (March, 1984, 11): “USTTA Secretary Rufford Harrison was invited to the White House for a state dinner honoring China’s Premier Zhao Ziyang. Harrison was extended the invitation as a result of his involvement in ‘Ping Pong Diplomacy’ nearly 13 years ago. Harrison, while attending the World Championships in Japan, was contacted by the Chinese officials and told that the U.S. Team was invited to mainland China for friendly competition. Harrison still maintains that “it was the most important event in my life” and sometimes finds it difficult to believe he was part of such a momentous event. Harrison’s wife Marty joined him for the dinner and amidst the hubbub of the elegant evening she managed to show President Reagan a photo of her horse.” Nancy Persaud also calls attention to Harrison’s invitation to the White House (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 3). First, she gives us a quote by Hugh Sidey from the Jan. 23, 1984 issue of Time Magazine, then a Letter to the Editor. Here’s Sidey: “A White House dinner is the American family assembled, from labor leaders to billionaires, actors, architects, academicians, and athletes. They gathered last Tuesday in honor of China’s Premier Zhao Ziyang, who governs more people than anyone in the world. There was a fellow named Harrison who led the U.S. Ping Pong Team to China back in 1971 [no, that was Graham Steenhoven—was he asked to attend?], and Connie Chung, the NBC anchor whose parents and four sisters were born in China and who bravely tried her Chinese on Zhao, who bravely professed understanding.” Now comes Persaud’s “Why Not Danny to the White House?” Letter: 17\n\n“I’ve just read the above account in a January issue of Time Magazine. Why wasn’t a PLAYER sent to the White House? If Rufford was invited, he could have sent someone a little more memorable instead. What a wonderful opportunity it would have been for Danny Seemiller to get something back for all he’s given. [But, Nancy, this was a state dinner for the Chinese Premier—surely Danny (worthy as he is to be honored) was not the appropriate choice for THIS occasion. Ping Pong Diplomacy is an important part of history in U.S.-China relations (still celebrated as I write in 2012), and after all it was Rufford who was first approached by the Chinese in 1971 Nagoya, Japan.] Danny has star quality and a physique that would stop a crowd. The reporter wouldn’t have said, ‘somebody named Seemiller’ if HE had gone! And T.T. might have gotten some great publicity. So Danny didn’t make the 1971 China trip. He could have gone to the White house representing T.T., or somebody who DID play and still plays (Olga [Soltesz], Judy [Bochenski]?) could have gone. One more missed opportunity for T.T. that wouldn’t have cost a thing. One more time when an official was highlighted when a player would have been better.”\n\nDanny Seemiller to the White House?\n\nPhoto by Dave Strang Well, for better or worse, here’s another time when an official is highlighted: Sol Schiff makes a Statement [though not his SPIN Election Campaign Statement] in Boggan’s own magazine (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 3):\n\n“I first want to thank Tim Boggan for his invitation to all E.C. candidates to write their campaign statements in his magazine. If I am invited to be a guest in someone’s home, I always treat my host with respect—I now feel I am a guest in his home (Boggan’s magazine) and as Tim Boggan is evidently now my host, I have no intention of stating anything that will be harmful or distasteful to him. My statements now will be clear, short, and to the point. I have had my personal character questioned and been called a liar by several people who are not now holding any office in the USTTA. The words we knew as kids (Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never harm me) is not quite true. A man’s name and honor is the most precious asset that a man can have. I was playing and winning table tennis tournaments before the existence of the USTTA and I became a member the year the USTTA was formed in 1933. Most of my life has been in our sport and I know that I have contributed to it as much as I received from it. For whatever my word means to you (it means a great deal to me), I have never lied or manipulated against my accusers and, most importantly, I have never knowingly lied to you, the membership of the USTTA. I have worked hard during the eight years of my Presidency and during those eight years we have accomplished more than in all the past years of the existence of the USTTA. We have had a few setbacks but setbacks occur in every successful sport and business. What we need most of all are capable people who are willing to devote time and effort to serve on the E.C. and USTTA committees. There are too many people who accept these positions and then either quit or else do not do anything after they are appointed. I know there are many capable, conscientious, and concerned individuals in our association that I hope will offer their services to the USTTA. I have one request to make of you, and that is to please cast your vote for Rufford Harrison 18\n\nfor Secretary of the USTTA. Harrison and Jimmy McClure are the two most capable men we have on the E.C. Harrison has always fulfilled every one of his assigned tasks and he is, by far, the most respected man we have on the international scene. Just last month, Rufford Harrison was invited and accepted an invitation offered by President Ronald Reagan to come to the White House for a reception that was given in honor for the Premier of the Peoples Republic of China. It is to your advantage and to the benefit of the USTTA to re-elect Rufford Harrison to office. I also want you to note that this article is being sent to Tim Boggan and I have no doubt that he will read this article and use its contents to help him in preparing his own statement. Please remember that he has the advantage of seeing my statement while I cannot see his own statement until after it is published. In conclusion, I would greatly appreciate a vote of confidence from you and I hope you will give me a great plurality over Tim Boggan. I am not nor do I want to be a dictator, but I need and want this large vote from you in order to impress the other elected people on the E.C. Do not vote to return to the years of 1972 to 1975 when Tim Boggan was President and then quit. As I stated previously, we have done a great deal the past eight years and I urge you to please let us continue even though we have a great deal farther to go. I look forward to the day when we can have a bright, intelligent, and energetic young man as USTTA President with an E.C. composed of capable and dedicated officials who will lead our sport to new and respected heights. Thank you, Sol Schiff” And here, while I allow the Election Campaign (and Schiff and Boggan’s Campaign Statements among others) to wait in abeyance before spinning all to its conclusion, is another Letter to the Editor— this a chapter-ending one from Matthew Zaputo of Las Vegas (SPIN, Mar. 5, 1984, 5): “…The candidates [for the upcoming election] should be commended on their eagerness to speak out and take their respective stands. However, I am disgruntled about the ongoing feud between Tim Boggan and the USTTA. [A better way of putting it might be: the serious disagreements between Boggan and not the organization he will serve for half a century or more but some of those people in it who’re currently exercising power.] The conflict is reaching the point of absurdity and I feel it is time someone spoke about it. Although I am not rated high (1149), nor have I been a member long (2 and ½ years), I feel my views are held by a large number of members. To begin, I would like to acknowledge the fact that, as he has made all too clear, Tim Boggan’s views have always been rather controversial. However, the constant criticizing and public display of disapproval of the USTTA and its agencies cannot be warranted, and are detrimental to both Boggan and the USTTA. But then the USTTA retaliates with some of the same tactics by repeatedly expressing its disapproval of many of Boggan’s actions and attitudes. If both parties would try to compromise and work together I feel a great deal could be accomplished, as both have a great deal to offer the Game which we, the membership, love. However, I grow tired of reading every month how one bitterly opposes the other. As a result, I hope the conflict is taken out of the two publications and into a mediator’s room so that the subscribers aren’t subjected to this asininity any longer.” [Mr. Zaputo, what you call “asininity” cannot be stopped short of the election by any mediator—and not perhaps even after the election.] 19\n\nChapter Two 1984: Jan. Tournaments.\n\nI continue with a change of pace—a review of first-of-the-year U.S. tournaments—but again with a beginning emphasis on what’s happened in the past. Cindy Miller (SPIN, Feb., 1984, 4), preparatory to the two Table Tennis World write-ups that follow, Mark Adelman Jack Howard gives us a short history of the Sacramento TTC. Cindy speaks of the $800 Columbus Day Open the Club ran in Oct., 1968— “one of the biggest prize money tournaments at the time that attracted Dal-Joon Lee, Jack Howard, Erwin Klein, Mark Adelman, Wayne Obertone, Dave Froelick [sic: for Froehlich], Glen [sic: for Glenn] Cowan, Del [sic: for Dell] Sweeris, Edmund Fong, Patty Martinez, and Angie Rosal. Jeff Mason, from the Sacramento Club, Jeff Mason was on his way to becoming a top player in the Photo by country at about this time. In 1969, Jeff won the A Don Gunn Singles [over Phil Woo] and Jr. Mixed Doubles [with Angie Rosal] at the U.S. Open and was also a finalist there in the U-17 Junior Boys [to Glenn Cowan]. During the next few years, however, Jeff began to change his focus from tournament play to coaching. He Tony Sutivej Photo by learned Mal Anderson coaching techniques from his own coaches, including Japan’s World Champion Ichiro Ogimura and Thai coach Thonchia “Tony” Sutivej. He first became a USTTA certified Regional Coach and is currently a USTTA National Coach. In Jan. of 1981, Jeff, his wife Mona Miller, and I opened Sacramento’s first permanent table tennis facility with nine tables. It was a struggle the first few months of operation to meet the $1,500 monthly rent plus the other bills. Jeff began teaching classes, clinics, and camps in addition to his 20\n\nprivate lessons. Leagues were also started which attracted a lot of new members. The STTC began hosting USTTA tournaments which drew additional players from throughout California. On June 9, 1982, with a loan from the bank, the STTC expanded. The adjacent part of the building was taken over and a connecting doorway was cut out of the intervening cement wall. The new section was even larger than the original 70 x 150 and the rent more than doubled. The old side became the practice area and the new section was used for tournament play, leagues, and classes. Since so many people told us that ‘Club’ sounded like we were closed to the public, the name changed to Table Tennis World of Sacramento.” Results of the 74-entry $600 Table Tennis World Winter Open, held in Sacramento Jan. 13-14: Under-2200: Mas Hashimoto ($100) over Erwin Hom, -17, 21, 6, 19.

At each tournament players accumulate Circuit Points as they progress in their play. The player with the highest number of Circuit Points from all three tournaments will be the Grand Prize winner receiving a minimum of $1,000. An additional amount of at least $2,000 will be divided up among the other top 15 players. More prize money will be given away if the Boy Scouts of America come through with their promise to sell 1,500 spectator tickets by the end of the three tournaments. This would boost the total prize money to $5,000. 21\n\nCircuit #1 began with all participants receiving a free Circuit T-shirt and a Program that included information on all the players. First-round play consisted of 16 Preliminary round-robin groups—with four to five players in each group. Only one player would come out of each group to advance to the second round. These 16 players would then be divided into four round-robin groups of four (#1, #2, #3, #4). The four winners from this second-round play would advance to form a final round robin, out of which would come the day’s highest Circuit #1 point winner. In the first round robin, there were two Zak Haleem upsets. Enrico Li, a strong looping and hitting Photo by penholder, blasted through Zak Haleem. Zak Mal Anderson was a top player in Egypt many years ago, and has only recently started playing again. ExAustrian player Toni Kiesenhofer was defeated by Joerg Fetzer, who’d moved to Sacramento from Switzerland. Fetzer’s strong placementblocks prevented Kiesenhofer from using his powerful loops, while Kiesenhofer’s out-ofposition returns were crushed by Fetzer forehands. Spectators really began arriving around noon. Many of them came to watch the highly publicized “Media Tournament” that was held concurrently with Circuit play from noon to 4:00 p.m. This scheduling was planned to bring in more spectators and expose them to top-level table tennis, and also to get media coverage for the Circuit. Many local TV celebrities, radio disc-jockeys, and newspaper reporters entered the “Media Tournament.” The Circuit was stopped for 15 minutes while 300 spectators watched a special doubles match. Circuit player Toni Kiesenhofer was teamed with Sacramento Union reporter Rob Gold. Their opponents were Circuit top-seed Khoa Nguyen and the Radio K108 Beaver (complete in beaver outfit). The players really hammed it up much to the delight of the spectators, with Toni and Rob defeating Khoa and the Beaver. After this, attention was shifted to the finishing preliminary Circuit “The Beaver” and Friend: matches. One such match was Sacramento K-108 DJs between James Therriault and Cindy Miller. As is often the case between these two, the match score came down to 1-1, with James chopping Cindy’s serves back, Cindy looping, and James lobbing in return. Cindy then would smash three or four times in a row against James’s sidespin lobs. This exciting exhibition-type match was finally won by James after many long rallies. The preliminary matches ended on schedule at 4:30, with the top 16 players ready to play in the second round. These players were divided into four round robins with four players in each 22\n\ngroup. There was only one upset: Duc Luu was defeated, 2-0, by an impressive player from Israel, Avishy Schmidt. In Group #1, Khoa Nguyen defeated David Chun, Enrico Li, and Carl Danner, the only player to take a game from Nguyen in the entire tournament. In Group #2, second-seed Dean Doyle blocked, placed, and smashed his way past Charles Childers, Azmy Ibrahim, and Joerg Fetzer all in straight games. In Group #3, there was a three-way tie between. Luu, Schmidt, and Therriault. Therriault defeated Mike Baltaxe, 22-20 in the 3rd with Mike smashing and James chopping and lobbing. Therriault also had an impressive win over Schmidt. In addition to upsetting Duc Luu, Schmidt, who advanced out of this group, also defeated Baltaxe, 2-0, whom he’d lost to just the day before in the Sacramento Winter Open. In Group #4, Erwin Hom played an incredible three-game match with Masaaki Tajima, both players trying to take the attack first. The most exciting match in this group, though, was between Hom and Masaru Hashimoto. Hashimoto looked like he would win with his calm, controlled style that allowed him to take the second game at 11. Hom came back in the third game, however, winning at 19. Hom also defeated Behzad Zandipour. In the final round robin group, Hom, playing extremely well, defeated Doyle in three games, 2-0, with the second game going to 26-24. Nguyen played a close, exciting game Khoa Nguyen wins with Schmidt. Avishy TT World’s Pro-Am Masaaki Tajima rolled Khoa’s serves Circuit #1 and initiated the Photo by attack, but it was Nguyen who won—and Robert Compton took first place in the tournament.” Sam Lima, longtime president of the Cupertino Club, writes: “I am retired now from my job with the San Jose Fire Dept. and am devoting my time to table tennis. I sold my five-table Center, sold the land so I could come out good for my Sam Lima retirement, but I’m continuing my table tennis by coaching and selling equipment. I’ve erected a building with one table, so, in addition to coaching there, I can rent it out. My phone’s listed, and I’m doing everything I can to pass on table tennis information and support the USTTA.” Here are the Minutes from the Southern California TTA Meeting held [at the Mar Vista Recreational Center at 3:00 p.m.?] Jan. 14, 1984 (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 23): “A Motion was passed authorizing Peter Antkowiak to draw up a seal for the SCTTA. The seal will be based on the USTTA logo with a bear and different colors. 23\n\nA Motion was passed to strongly suggest to all tournament sponsors to charge a $5.00 late fee, and not to accept late singles entries the day of the tournament. A motion was passed suspending the two-color racquet rule for Unrated Singles and all 1200 and Under events until June 1st, 1984. The players playing with one color must have the same type of rubber on both sides of the racquet. Ching Shyue Wu, after giving a Coaching Report, resigned as Coaching Chair because he is returning to Taiwan. Dr. Eugene Taw was elected to replace him, and Joe Yoon was accepted as Assistant Coaching Chair. A Motion was passed to send a letter of appreciation to Jim Williamson, Treasurer of the now disbanded California TTA, for holding $372.37 in funds and giving it to this organization—which now has $1,187.37 in its treasury. The Motion also included the purchase of a $25 plaque for Mr. Williamson in appreciation of his services. Jim West, who brought the check from Mr. Williamson, provided a copy of the Constitution and Bylaws of the old CTTA. A Motion was passed to allow a person (if he/she wishes) to keep 25% of all donations he/she brings to our non-profit SCTTA. The next meeting will be held on Mar. 17, 1984 at 3:00 p.m. at Rich Livingston’s home in Burbank.” Rich Livingston\n\nTom Wintrich [SPIN, Mar., 1984, 22) reports on the Rocky Mountain Closed, held Jan. 28th in Fort Collins, CO. For this one-day tournament, Director Paul Williams “wisely limited the tourney to just seven events.” This was a good idea because, “instead of the 40-50 players expected, 67 entrants showed, and, with but six tables to play on, the day was non-stop action until 11:00 p.m….With the diligent help of Debbie Dixon and Steve Walker, the tournament ran smoothly [despite being expanded to 10 events] and not late enough that the participants couldn’t enjoy a gathering at the local pizza parlor afterwards….The players thank Paul and crew for their well-run competition. And I personally thank him for the gracious hospitality he provided to Bob Tretheway, Mark Zochowski, and me. The outstanding player of the tournament was Dana Jeffries, who has shed 15 pounds and regained the use of his right arm following an injury. Jeffries reached the semi’s of the Open before losing to the eventual winner Bohdan Dawidowicz. Also, in the final of the Senior’s, by winning the first two games, Dana extended Bohdan into the fifth. It was quite a physical and mental struggle for Dana to hit so well against Dawidowicz’s excellent defense.” Results: Open Singles. Dawidowicz, 12, -16, 8, 20, over Howard Grossman who’d -19, 12, 15, 15 stopped Johan Englund in the other semi. Open Doubles: Bohdan/Kasia Dawidowicz over Wintrich/ Williams, 15, -19, 7.

SPIN (Apr., 1984, 19) reports that Stefan Florescu of the Rolling Romanians Sports Club “has done it again. Not only has the Lincoln Park quadriplegic been inducted into the National Wheelchair Sports Hall of Fame and named the winner of many national and international gold and silver medals for swimming, table tennis, and wheelchair track, but now he has added singing to his list of conquests. On Jan. 25th, 1984, in Milwaukee’s World Veterans Administration Medical Center, Florescu was proclaimed the winner of two gold medals in area competition of the 1984 National Music Festival for Veterans. Florescu, an outpatient at the Medical Center for spinal injuries, said tapes of all winning performers were sent to Chicago for regional judging, and based on the tapes national winners will be chosen. Stef Forescu 25\n\nThe Lincoln Park man took one medal in the folk music category and the other for original composition. Florescu said the first time he sang publicly was during a Boy Scout camp when he was 12 years old. ‘Stef,’ founder of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America (1961) and the Annual Michigan Wheelchair Games (1965), would like to organize a similar Michigan music festival for all Michigan handicappers. All interested amateur singers and instrumentalists with physical handicaps should write to Michigan PVA, 30406 Ford Rd., Garden City, MI 48135.” Canadian TTA Technical Director Adham Sharara [years later to be President of the ITTF] tells us (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 15) that the “Air Canada Sports Awards was made at the CJOH-TV (CTV) studios in Ottawa on Jan. 20th, 1984 and televised nationally on the 21st on CTV’s Wide World of Sports.” Among the three finalists for the “Executive of the Year” award was Marg Walden. In finishing runner-up to Geraldine York, President of the Canadian Blind Sports Federation, “Marg received a beautiful personalize plaque and two Air Canada passes to anywhere Air Canada travels.” Adham stresses that “to all of us, Marg and Table Tennis were the real winners. We received several minutes of National Table Tennis Marg Walden coverage (worth millions) and Marg was recognized as being an exceptional Photo by Mal Anderson volunteer working on behalf of her sport for forty-seven (47) years. And that is not all: due to Marg’s ‘win’ the CTTA will receive Air Canada passes for 1984. THANK YOU, MARG.”\n\nAnother CTTA official, current Program Co-ordinator, Michel Goyette, having a few weeks earlier conducted a Training Camp in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, now gives us the results of the Jan. 28-29 Montreal Open. “This was the first National Circuit Tournament of the New Year and once again Alain Bourbonnais, who has not lost a single tournament he’s entered (including the National Top 12 #1) since Sept., 1983, grabbed the title, defeating Errol Caetano (from down 2-0) in the final. The tournament was held at the Mirabel Indoor Tennis and Racquetball Club (getting that\n\nAlain Bourbonnais Photo by Brian Thususka\n\n26\n\nvenue’s a good habit) and the Quebec TTF provided all the participants with very good playing facilities and accommodations. Results: Open Singles: Final: Bourbonnais over Mitch Rothfleisch, 12, -11, 17, 16, then over Caetano, -18, -13, 7, 17, 13. Women’s Singles: Final: Mariann Domonkos over Gloria Hsu, 16, 16, -15, 23. Men’s Doubles: Bourbonnais/Rothfleisch over Yvan Dolan/Stephane Charbonneau. Women’s Doubles: Hsu/Thanh Mach over Julia Johnson/Becky McKnight. Mixed Doubles: Bao Nguyen/Domonkos over Rothfleisch/Johnson. Senior’s: Derek Wall over Paul Rozier. Perhaps, given the Racquet Club’s advantages over most sites, Coordinator Goyette didn’t think it proper Derek Wall to be critical of this tournament. But Canadian Coach Alain Thomas didn’t feel like holding back. He had this to say: “Since spectators didn’t rush to this tournament any more than they do in Toronto, it didn’t matter that there wasn’t enough seating for hopedfor attendance. However, it did matter that there was a three-hour initial delay in the tournament schedule (due to the double-booking of the facilities). Such a shortcoming will no doubt be resolved in the future, and Alain Thomas then, if we can count on a more efficient handling of the tournament itself by From OTTA Update, Feb-Mar, ‘84 Quebec officials, we will all be happy to return. Because there were long periods during which only a few of the 18 tables available were actually used for match play—I even saw a few minutes without a single match on—everything was delayed and the tournament ended at 1:30 a.m. (Errol Caetano, for example, played his first Open Singles match, scheduled for 12:30 p.m., at 9:00 p.m.) These delays affected our players’ performance and wallets (supplemental hotel and meal expenses), not to mention their frustration which somewhat dampened the pleasant atmosphere created by our welcoming friends.” Winners at the Jan. 14th Eastern Canada Open: Men’s: Steve Lyons over David Mahabir , 23, 21. Women’s: Julia Johnson over Daiva Koperski, 9, 21, after Daiva had downed Michelle Qurrey, 16, 24. Men’s Doubles: Lyons/Mitch Rothfleisch over Richard Chin/Fred Taylor.

Jr. Miss U-11: Thimian over Dina da Silva, 23-21 in the 3rd. 27\n\nRick Hardy, struggling at times to retain consciousness as Tournament Referee at the Jan. 21st Grand Opening Open of the Cleveland, Ohio Club, is, I think, alert enough here to cover that tournament for us (Timmy’s Feb.-Mar., 1984, 24): “Once upon a time, there was a new table tennis Club in Cleveland. And, like all table tennis clubs, they needed money. So they decided to have a tournament. Not a large one, you understand, just a normal 50-entry Ohio two-star. Well, they sent out their entry blanks and waited for the entries to come in the mail. And how they came! Until, on Friday night, they had 85 people to play on six tables in one day. But the gallant Tournament Director, Lori Berenson, carried on. Through the quagmire of matches they slogged, as the tournament fell several hours behind. At last Rick, his brain shot, retired to sit staring blankly into space (only to arise well after midnight to win the U-3400 Doubles). But Lori, with the indispensible help of visitors Rod Mount and Chris Wibbelman, continued on until finally the tournament finished. It ended at 4:45 a.m. Sunday with a prize-money split between Mount and Dave Alt in the B final. Alt had just beaten Doug Hardy 26-24 in the 3rd in a match that was incredibly well-played considering the hour. [It was a match listed in the Results as one of the semi’s in the A’s [sic]; the other showing Mount over Dave Cafone. Perhaps Rick (still a bit brain-dead?) had nodded off while sending Timmy’s these scores, for the Lori Berenson result of the A final reads: Bob Cordell over Jim Repasy, 6, 10, 11.] In between, Brian Masters easily took the Open Singles, beating runner-up Randy Seemiller, #3 finisher Simon Shtofmakher, and Bobby Powell, losing in all just one game to Shtofmakher. Randy beat Simon and Bobby both in four, after which Bobby defaulted to Simon. All players showed great patience and appreciated our efforts. Our next tournament is planned for TWO days.” Other results: Women’s: Lydia Balciunas over Ellen Gibson. U-3700 Doubles: Bob Allshouse/Robert Cloutier over D. Hardy/D. Berenson, deuce in the 3rd.

Jim Fulks\n\nI began this Chapter with talk of a change of pace, of an emphasis on what’s happened in the past. It seems appropriate then that I bring in (Timmy’s, June, 1984, 18) Steve Isaacson’s belated coverage of the St. Joe Valley Open, played in South Bend, IN, Jan., 1954: “The St. Joe Valley is actually the highlight of the winter season. Next to the National’s and the Intercities, this is the title that everyone wants. Conditions at the South Bend YMCA are perfect and John Varga (with the assistance of Joe Bernat) sees that every event is run on schedule…or else!! This year that task seemed monumental because there were actually nine events to run!! Someone here suggested that there should be more events…A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, E Novice Doubles Consolation, etc. Ridiculous!! Nine events are already too many!! Most of the players arrived Friday night and are staying at the luxurious Oliver Hotel. Others unable to afford $8.00 a night were able to get a room right here at the Y for $3.00. Joe Bernat This year’s Championship event was struck a disastrous blow by the untimely withdrawal of the snowbound St. Louis contingent, including Bill Price, George Hendry, Jim Tancill, Wally Gundlach, Don Lasater, and National Boy’s Champion Alphonse Holtman. Fortunately the draw was redone in time. Since highly-ranked Miles, Pagliaro, Somael, Schiff, Hazi, Hirschkowitz, and Gusikoff were guests of Joe Dimaggio and the World Champion New York Yankees for the weekend, most of the top seeds this year were Chicagoans. Men’s Singles—Quarter’s (top half): Top-seeded Bernie Bukiet, a recent immigrant from Germany, had no trouble with Chuck Burns, even though Burns came wrapped in enough bandages to supply the Detroit Lions for three seasons!! Bukiet, either not noticing or not caring, gave Chuck absolutely no sympathy, and not many points either!! Oh, well, Chuck…you’ll be in the Senior’s soon. 29\n\nTim Boggan, of the University of Dayton, a five-game upset winner over Ralph Bast in the Collegian eighth’s, ran out of gas against unseeded, unknown, Boggan unheralded, untalented Richard Puls, who earlier had destroyed 8th-seed Keith Porter. Puls, playing with some kind of New Paddle called ‘Sponge Rubber’ that apparently imparts strange, silent spins, left Porter destroying his entire arsenal of 35 paddles, and caused Boggan to vow that he would never shave again until Sponge is banned. Ha! Can you imagine collegian Boggan with a beard? The Dodgers will move out of Brooklyn first! Quarter’s (bottom half): No surprises here—former U.S. Champ Bill Holzrichter finished off chopper Marty Prager three straight. Both had reached the quarter’s with fourgame victories: Holzrichter over apoplectic V. Lee Webb, and Prager over USTTA President Jim Shrout. Local defensive ace Dave Krizman, seeded sixth, and U.S. #6 Allen Levy had a sensational quarter-final match. Levy won the first two easily, 21-14, 21-12, and apparently had the match well in hand. But each point got longer and longer with Krizman retrieving ball after ball seemingly from the second balcony! At one point, Umpire John Read actually called the score after what he thought was an ungettable putaway by Levy—only to see the ball returned from three tables over…a clear Krizman winner!!! Third game to Krizman, 22-20. Fourth to Krizman, 21-18. Fifth to Krizman, 215—and back to the Net and Paddle Club for an arm-weary Levy. Semi’s: Puls’s sponge was wiped clean by Bukiet’s unforgiving forehand. Said Bernie, ‘Sponge? Me no see Sponge. What it is anyway? Junk rubber?’\n\n30\n\nThe Holzrichter-Krizman encounter was a sensational example of the old and the new, and an almost exact copy of the Krizman-Levy quarter-final. Down 2-0, Krizman merely shifted into second gear and it was all over. Final score: -15, -14, 18, 19, 10. Final: Could Krizman chop down Bukiet? (Hmph…could Bergmann chop down Eric Boggan as yet not even a twinkle in Timmy’s eye? Nope!) Nobody can chop down Bukiet!! Nobody!! Final score: 21-10, 21-11, 21-12. I am going to predict here and now that Bernie Bukiet will win at least three U.S. Men’s Singles titles, and will be a figure to contend with on the table tennis scene for the next 30-40 years!! Women’s: In the Women’s final, Millie Shahian was an easy winner over second-seed Peggy Ichkoff. Peggy had survived a five-game struggle with five-time U.S. Champ Sally Green Prouty in the semi’s, while Millie had had little trouble with 12-year-old U.S. Junior Miss Champion Sharlene Krizman. Juniors: The Junior players were astonished to have two-time Olympic Decathlon Champion Bob Mathias present the awards. Peggy Ichkoff Sally Green Prouty Mathias, who captured his second Gold Medal last year in Helsinki, vowed that one day he would head the U.S. Olympic Movement and make Table Tennis an Olympic Sport!! Ridiculous, you say? No more than cowboys in the White House!! And what a Junior field! Topseeded Dave Krizman, the Men’s runner-up, couldn’t survive the semi’s, falling three straight to Chicago’s Steve Isaacson. (Listen, if I can make this stuff up, I can sure as hell be in there to win the damned tournament!) Cincinnati’s Harley Bradford topped U.S. Junior Champion Carl Dentice of Milwaukee in the other half. After his match with Harley, Dentice complained of chest pains. Dr. Bill Meszaros looked quite concerned—so I’ll keep you informed of developments. In the final, budding cartoonist Isaacson massacred Dave Krizman Steve Isaacson Photo by Igor Lissevy Bradford, 21-5, 21-6, 21-10. 31\n\nWell, gotta go now. President Eisenhower’s going to be on the tube—something about Vietnam, whatever that is. Then Rocky Marciano is defending his title against another stiff! See you next month!!” An unsigned article [Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 24) provides coverage for the 1983 [sic: for 1984] $1,000 Louisiana Open. It was sponsored by the Baton Rouge Club “over a severely cold weekend, Jan. 14-15, and drew over 70 players from six states.” In the Open Singles, the #1 and #2 finishers, Lehan [sic: for Lekan] Fenuyi and Perry Schwartzberg, “have become everyday practice partners since Perry moved back to Houston a few months ago. As a result, both have improved immensely and have climbed to the Top Ten in the U.S. A close and exciting match was expected, but it turned out to be a lop-sided one—Fenuyi won 3-0. For some reason Perry has not done well in Louisiana tournaments. It may be a jinx, or perhaps it’s the tables, as he has claimed every time he has come here. Or perhaps it could be that Lehan [Lekan] is playing better than Perry.” In “Help! Help! Help!” (SPIN, Jan., 1984, 18), Perry writes, “I’m looking for an old style Stiga Alser blade. This is the one that originally came with a picture of Alser on the handle. If the picture is long gone, you will know it is the old style because it will not have the circular insert in the handle.

Bard Brenner’s coverage of that Closed will follow in a moment—but, first, a few words about Ted. Here’s Randy Hess [SPIN, Feb., 1984, 13): “Ted Bourne fell and died of a stroke or rupture of a main artery, Jan. 14th while playing table tennis at the Florida State Closed. I knew Ted for over 20 years. During the early ‘60’s, we played every week together at the Spaceport Table Tennis Club in Cocoa, FL. Sometimes, several of us played till two or three in the morning concluding 12 Randy Hess hours of continuous play. …One of Ted’s favorite tricks while performing with his partner at half-time during the Harlem Globetrotter games was to keep four balls going at once. The entertainment business was what he enjoyed, and he helped Dick Miles to start appearing in shows. On one of his travels he played before the Shah and Queen of Iran. The Shah gave him a solid silver cigar box. A lot of Ted’s stories seemed unbelievable and I had my doubts until I saw his huge photo album which documented his stories. Lori, Ted’s wife, remembered that Ted often said that when his time came, he wanted to go while playing table tennis.” In an adjacent article in SPIN, 1938 USTTA President Stan Morest said that when he lived in Stuart, FL from 1975-1980 Ted coached him. He tells us one of the many stories he heard from Ted: “During World War II while in Baghdad, Ted heard, as he said, ‘the click of the little celluloid ball,’ as he passed the Red Cross Center. Going inside, Ted saw Polish soldiers playing table tennis. After he’d watched a while, a player approached and handed him a racket. An invitation to play followed. Ted easily beat the soldier. Then another player came up and said, ‘Me see you very fine Merican player. You play me too?’ Ted agreed. As he walked on to the court he noticed that the pool players stopped playing and others came over to watch. Ted surmised at that point there must be a reason for the interest. He played the first game defensively, losing 21-7. The second game he played offensively but also lost 21-7. 33\n\nAs he shook hands with his victorious opponent, he said, ‘I’m Ted Bourne from New York.’ The winner replied, “Me Melik Schieff.’ Ted told me he could have sunk through the floor as he instantly recalled that this Schieff was the only player Sol Schiff didn’t beat in the Swaythling Cup competition at the 1937 World Championships. Ted had just played the Polish Champion!” The following Profile of Bourne (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 25) was written by Daniel Ross for the Feb. 28, ’81 Vero Beach Press Journal that appeared in the Apr., 1982 issue of Table Tennis Topics: “Ted Bourne, 69, a long-time Vero Beach, Florida resident, who still speaks with an English accent though he came to the States when he was 12, has had vast experience in how table tennis can put smiles on people’s faces. From 1948 to 1958 Bourne, a bachelor until age 62, performed table tennis games and tricks during half-time shows of the Harlem Globetrotters. From November through April for 10 years, Bourne and his partner, Bob Anderson, performed in a different place every night. In his Vero Beach home Bourne explained a trick that mystified the Globetrotters’ fans. He would kneel with his back to the playing table and suspend the ball in mid-air by blowing on it. Then he would hit the ball with his paddle over his shoulder to his partner at the far end of the table. Bourne would then catch his partner’s return shot in his mouth. Again turning his back to the table, he would spit the ball against his stationary paddle hard enough to bounce back over his head to his partner. His partner’s return shot would then rocket into Bourne’s chest and, as if the wind were knocked from him, he would cough up two more Ping Pong balls. Laszlo Bellak demonstrates Nothing with less of a cavernous mouth than a blow technique Photo by Mal Anderson hippopotamus can hold three balls, so the crowd was baffled. After Bourne spat the ball against his paddle and it bounced to his partner, he would pull a ‘slight of mouth’ and gobble the two extra balls without the crowd’s ever seeing. Magic tricks. Bourne’s travels with Abe Saperstein’s Globetrotters validated the word ‘globetrotting.’ He played in Europe, Hawaii, Alaska, and Cuba among many other places. In 1952 he ‘flew all over Alaska in a DC 3’ with the Olympic great and former world’s fastest human, Jesse Owens, playing for Alaskan Indians who knew about table tennis though they had no cars. Also during 1952 in Cuba when Bourne’s regular partner was absent, the Globetrotters’ owner, Saperstein, produced a Cuban opponent and told Bourne, ‘If that guy beats you, you’re fired!’ The Cuban player, holding his racket like a pen, gave Bourne a memorable test of his competitive skills, but Bourne won. After the contest, Saperstein told him that his opponent was the Cuban National Champion. Eight years ago a man approached Bourne in Miami, Florida, and said, “You’re the man that beat me in Cuba.’ Small world. Sadly, Bourne’s long-time partner, Anderson, died on the last day of touring with the Globetrotters. 34\n\nBetween April and November of his table tennis days with the Globetrotters, Bourne followed in the footsteps of his father and earned his keep as a Professional Golf Association club pro. Today he still retains his PGA membership card which he earned at 18. Though he would have the right to be arrogant after beating the Cuban Champion, Bourne downplays his competitive abilities and stresses that he was always ‘considered a very good teacher.’ Dr. Stan Morest, one of the best Veteran players in the U.S., is a former Bourne pupil who can attest to his teaching ability. Bourne and his wife of eight years, Lurie, run the Physical and Cultural Arts Center in Pocahontas Park, downtown Vero Beach, every Wednesday night. While Bourne teaches table tennis, his wife handles registration and signs out games such as chess. Working at the Physical and Cultural Arts Center, along with picking up fallen oranges from his backyard trees, helps the 69-year-old Bourne keep active. ‘Soon as you slow down you’re ready for the library.’ Bourne will not be ready for the Library for a long time.” Now back to Brenner and the Florida Closed, played in Orlando, Jan. 14-15 (Timmy’s, Feb.-Mar., 1984, 25). Of course, before giving us the Results of the tournament, Bard must mention Bourne: “I was told that Ted Bourne of Vero Beach had suffered a heart attack while hitting a forehand and died. He’d succumbed despite the valiant efforts of Tournament Referee Toby Hart, who’d tried to revive him with CPR techniques.” Results: Championship Singles: Final: Ron Rigo successfully defended his State Championship—again, as last year, over Greg Gingold, 16, 9, 10, 19. Best early-round matches: “Jacksonville’s Dan Kutzer’s deuce in the 3rd, 4th, AND 5th comeback victory over Tournament Committee member Bill Godshalk; Rene Tywang’s exciting play in forcing Olga Soltesz into the 5th; Randy Hess’s shocking Florida Closed Runner-up Florida Closed Champ Ron Rigo five-game upset of Tampa Greg Gingold junior star Kit Jeerapaet; and Gingold’s five-game struggle with Cameron Phipps.” Women’s Championship: 1.

E’s: Joe Long over Sean Hanley, 17, -22, -14, 18, 20. Senior’s: Brenner over S. Rigo. Junior’s: Hanley over Long. Two weeks later, Bard reports on the Florida Winter Open, held Jan. 28-29 at Newgy’s, his home club in Miami. He begins with Newgy pro-manager Marty Prager “celebrating the new year by starting a new program—a college-credit course, held on Saturdays at Newgy’s for the Miami-Dade Community College System. In fact, one of the requirements of the course for two of Marty’s 1988 Olympic hopefuls was to enter this January tournament.” Whoops—surprise!—the club’s lights went out during Saturday’s matches. But for Sunday’s Championship play all was back to normal. Results: Championship Singles (“since Jerry Thrasher was a few hundred rating points above the other entrants, we deliberately skewed the draw so as not to ‘sacrifice’ anyone”): 1. Super-looper Thrasher, 3-0 (didn’t lose a game). 2. “Unorthodox, honeycombed-bat player Dickie Fleisher,” 2-1 (lost games, one at deuce, only to Thrasher). 3.-4.
