He will be dearly missed by his sailing companion and partner of 39 years, Pat; his devoted daughter and swimming and sailing buddy, Nancy Noel, and her husband, Anthony George Cardinal, of Fletcher. His idolizing grandsons, Brandon James and Mason Christopher, will miss their \"Dad Dad.\" his Lewis Carroll poems and magic tricks. Chris was born in New York City on Sept. 17, 1939, the son of Oscar Lorenz Nils Niilsson and Gertrude Lyons Nilsson. He is survived by his brother, Andrew Nilsson and sisterini-law, Barbara Presson-Nilsson, of Willimantic, Conn. Relatives in the area include cousins, Dr. Richard Lyons and his wife, Ginnie, of Williston, Bob and Bea Heisinger of Tobyhanna, Pa.; and many nieces and nephews. As a teen-ager in the 1950s in Granite, Md., Chris enjoyed rebuilding his 1937 Chevy and constructing a computer long before they were commonplace. In his 1958 Park School (Baltimore, Md.) yearbook, Chris was remembered by his friends for his car breakdowns and repairs and also for his ability to patiently explain \"how things worked.\" Under his class photo was written, \"A good man and just.\" During several summers in the 1950s, Chris was a camp counselor at Hawkeye Trail Camps on Silver Lake in the Adirondack Mountains. He often wondered how anyone could possibly drown, as he felt he could swim all day. He hiked Mount Joe, Mount Marcy and Whiteface. One of Chris' exciting experiences was surviving Hurricane Hazel while on an overnight hike. Chris attended Union College on a Lacrosse scholarship. He was the first recipient of a master's degree in computer science from the University of Vermont. Later, he worked on his Ph.D. at McGill University in Montreal. Throughout his life, Chris found dyslexia both a challenge and a gift. The challenge was in putting words on paper. Fortunately, his mother was acquainted with Margaret Rawson and the Orton Society. They recognized his needs and developed a strategy to showcase Chris' abilities. Dyslexia was a gift in that it provided Chris with unique abilities in solving mathematical and spatial problems. He was a gifted designer. In 1987, Chris was honored at a Gala in Boston given by the New England Branch of the Orton Dyslexia Society for being one of New England's successful dyslexics. He was presented this award by Raymond Flynn, Mayor of Boston, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy, who remarked to Chris that he wished he could have used dyslexia to explain his own scholastic record. Christopher worked at IBM in Essex Junction from 19651990, except for a three-year position at headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J. He was a systems analyst and loved everything about computers. He received a Division Award for a Tool UtilizationProgram and attended IBM's Systems Research Institute in New York City. Always mindful of his dyslexic academic struggles in school, Chris worked in IBM's Partners in Education program and went into area schools, including Mount Mansfield and Cabot, to tutor students in mathematics and computer science. In 1975, IBM selected Chris to serve as an adjunct professor of mathematics at Delaware State College. Chris served as a U.S. Coast Guard Corpsman Reservist. While living in Fletcher, he served as a justice of the peace, town treasurer for the Democratic Party, and Explorer Scout leader, and town agent for Franklin County Home Health. Chris began hiking the Green Mountains in 1965 after he moved to Vermont. To celebrate his 46th birthday, he took a month to hike the Long Trail from Massachusetts to Canada. As a lifelong camper, Chris' philosophy was to leave the world better than he found it and have fun along the way. In the last year of his life, Chris and his 5-year-old grandson, Brandon, started a Nilsson family tradition - a September hike on their \"special\" mountain. Chris took early retirement from IBM to return to the classroom. (He had taught fifth grade for two years at Glenmount School in Baltimore, Md., in the early 1960s). Back in the classroom, he taught computer science at Winooski High School and then physics and physical science at Enosburg High School. He was proud of his Enosburg physics students who won numerous honors at the University of Vermont Technology and Design competitions. In 1996, Chris was nominated to the \"Who's Who of America's Teachers.\" In 1998, with Y2K looming, Chris left teaching to have fun as a computer consultant. He traveled to California, Indiana, Boston, Buffalo, and back to Vermont. Pat joined him as often as possible. His love of solving problems helped take his mind off the horrific medical procedures that characterized his battle with melanoma. Another of Chris' endeavors, a web site for locating newpapers, N-Net.com, won an award for being one of the top 100 newspaper sites on the web. Chris embraced life wholeheartedly. Each day was an opportunity for him to explore, contemplate, and solve problems in a unique way. Curious about how things worked, from mechanical devices to the mysteries of the universe, he would quote Einstein or M.C. Escher as if they were personal friends. Chris was an avid crosscountry skier and served on the Bolton Valley Ski Patrol. A favorite outing was to ski from Underhill to Stowe, where he would meet Pat for lunch. The weekend following his death, his friend, Carvel Bevans, skied the trail as a memorial to Chris. As much as Chris loved skiing and hiking, his true passion was sailing Even his nursery school records stated that he often pretended to be in a boat surrounded by water. The most memorable family moments were aboard his sailboard, \"Breezy,\" in Maine. Grandson birthday parties on the sloop were the highlights of the summer. Always loving a challenge, Chris took his family through pea-soup fog in Maine, 25-foot swells at Martha's Vineyard, and hurricane-force winds on Long Island Sound with a look of joy on his face, a compass before him, and faith in his dead reckoning. The family expresses sincere gratitude to their many friends in the community and at BFA Fairfax, neighbors, doctors, and the tireless staff of the VNA for supporting a peaceful end to Christopher's life. A memorial service celebrating Chris' life will be held March 16 at 2 p.m. in the Mozart Room at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe. Donations in Chris' memory may be made to the Green Mountain Club, 4711 Waterbury-Stowe Road, Waterbury Center, Vt. 05677.\n\nCAROL ROSEMARY (COOLUM) FRANCIS\n\nJOHNSON - Carol Rosemary Francis, 51, passed away peacefully at home (March 2, 2002 ???) with her loving family by her side, after her long, courageous battle with breast cancer.

Huntley died peacefully Friday, Feb. 8, 2002, in Rutland Regional Medical Center after a long and courageous battle with lung disease. His loving family was at his bedside. Paul was born July 29, 1927, in Westford, the son of Herbert E. and Jennie Tatro Huntley. He grew up on a farm and graduated with honors from Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax in 1944. Paul began his lifetime of service to his country and the state of Vermont when at the early age of 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served in the Pacific Theater and was aboard the first mine sweeper that entered Tokyo Bay at the close of World War II. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy, with the rank of chief petty officer. He entered the Vermont State Police Training Academy in 1952 and after successful completion was promoted to trooper second class and assigned to the Derby (Vt.) Barracks. During his career with the Vermont State Police, he was assigned to several duty stations including Middlesex, Rutland, St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro, Vermont State Police Headquarters in Montpelier, and the Police Training Academy in Pittsford, where he instructed police public relations and drug identification.
