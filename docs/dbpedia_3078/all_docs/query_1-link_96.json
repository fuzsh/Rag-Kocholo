        "text": "Hot take: Historical dramas could be the answer to helping writers to be paid fairly. 💸 As the Writers Strike continues, Hollywood is scrambling for solutions to an age-old problem: creating successful films within a reasonable budget. Barbie and Oppenheimer recently debuted on the big screen as legitimate box office and critical successes. Where can big savings be made? Intellectual Property. • It’s estimated that Warner Bros. paid toymaker Mattel anywhere between $25-50 million for the branding rights to Barbie. • While Oppenheimer is adapted from American Prometheus, an award-winning biography on the theoretical physicist, the film gets most of its IP from history. • Why? Because history is an endless source of what can be considered ‘free IP’. Most people know something about JFK, and are intrigued by his story. There have been many successful retellings of the former president’s life over the years, but there’s certainly room for more different adaptations. There are people and periods as recognisable and loved as today’s biggest brands. Choosing these stories will free up much-needed funds to pay the very best writing talent fairly. Everybody wins. 👏 #documentary #television #entertainmentindustry #televisionproduction #filmindustry\n\nPress Release from PSI Publishing Inc. “What SuperPower Would You Choose: To Fly or to Be Invisible?” Imagine a world where SuperPowers are not just the stuff of comic books and movies but a reality. What if you could choose between the ability to fly or to become invisible? This is the thrilling premise of Roger E. Pedersen's captivating sci-fi dystopian book series, \"SuperPower: The Ability to Fly or to Become Invisible.\" Let's discover what makes Pedersen's work stand out in the crowded genre of sci-fi and dystopian fiction. Set in a post-pandemic world, the series starts with a prologue introducing Professor Steele. He is a wealthy philanthropist and a smart academic. Steele loves art and technology, so he teams up with FA-King, a top art expert, to plan a heist of valuable artworks. We also meet Paul Spence, a young banker falsely accused of stealing money. His life changes dramatically when he discovers he can become invisible by blinking three times quickly. This power helps him survive and seek revenge on those who wronged him. He uses his invisibility to pull off daring heists against the corrupt system. Pedersen's series explores the good and bad sides of having SuperPowers. The ability to fly or become invisible raises important ethical questions. For Paul, invisibility is both a blessing and a curse. It helps him in tough situations, but also brings moral challenges. His writing is well-researched and entertaining. He provides detailed descriptions of art and banking, making the story informative. The humor throughout the series makes the characters relatable and enjoyable. The series blends fact and fiction. It includes references to real-world questions, like a Forbes article asking, \"Which SuperPower Would You Choose: To Fly or To Be Invisible?\" This connection makes readers think about the deeper implications of these abilities. The prologue hints at a future where technology and human evolution mix in surprising ways. Professor Steele's \"Babble Tongue computer chip\" can translate languages in real-time, breaking communication barriers. This advanced technology contrasts with the timeless beauty of art, like da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Roger E. Pedersen's \"SuperPower: The Ability to Fly or to Become Invisible\" is a great read for sci-fi and dystopian fiction fans. ou can find the books in eBook, audiobook, and softcover formats on Amazon, Google Play, B&N, Kobo, Target, Walmart, and many local bookstores. Dive into the world of SuperPowers and decide whether you would choose the ability to fly or become invisible. ######################### StoryRocket.com is the world's best book-to-film site. To OPTION the second film The Next Generation: https://lnkd.in/er2A3iGj To OPTION the first book The Deal of the Art: https://lnkd.in/eSDHrqb6\n\nI'm a prolific reader and yes, that includes lots of business books - but I'm willing to bet that many here are also familiar with Carley Fortune's blockbuster fiction: “Every Summer After” and “Meet Me At The Lake”. I loved reading this piece from Toronto Life Magazine about the author's shift from journalism to fiction and her rise on bestseller lists. I'm a sucker for Canadian or Ontario settings and it’s always great to see Canadian talent recognized - but Carley's story is worthy of celebration for another reason: because it's honest about what it takes to get to this level of success. It may seem like a lucky career pivot - and there may be a touch of luck there too - but it takes more than that to produce consistent results. PASSION In this case, passion for love stories, for Canadian settings, for writing itself: “I’ve discovered that writing fiction is the thing I love doing more than anything else” PURPOSE Giving her readers an escape, just as she needed one when she was at a tough point in her life PRACTICE 15 yrs as a magazine editor, read more than 150 romance books before writing her own - ie. studied storytelling for almost two decades HARD WORK When she commits, she gives it her all: “I wake up with the sun and put on coffee, then sit down at the table by the window or work outside … until evening hits” PROCESS Solicits editing inputs right at ideation stage; has editor “poke a thousand holes” to get to a stronger outcome COMMITMENT Carley keeps going: third book publishing this month, a fourth one in the works, and a fifth one in ideation. This is the blueprint. No shortcuts. P.S. For fans: you can now pre-order the May release of “This Summer Will Be Different” https://lnkd.in/gVfYJkbA\n\nLast Thursday evening, in a filled performing arts auditorium, my client launched his 5th book. 🎉 🙌 At the podium, describing the writing process, he made a joke about his editor suggesting he cut an entire segment because it was “not relevant, detracted from the story, so out went 3 or 4,000 words…”⁣ ⁣ Everyone laughed at his obvious chagrin. He’d clearly loved that section. ⁣ ⁣ The editor he was talking about? ⁣ ⁣ Me. ⁣ ⁣ It wasn’t fun for me to tell him to nix that part either. I knew he’d worked hard on it, and it 𝘸𝘢𝘴 interesting. But it took readers’ attention away from his primary subject and, even more importantly, his main argument. So it had to go. ⁣ ⁣ Even with the extra space in a 300-word book (like my client’s) or a 3-hour epic movie, you have to keep your eye on the prize. ⁣ ⁣ Focus on the parts of the story that matter most for your goals and your audience. ⁣ ⁣ When it comes to your brand’s story, this means being selective about how you pull your message together. ⁣ ⁣ Not every celebratory moment or low point will be relevant to your audience, though they may personally be significant for you. Ask yourself - ⁣ ⁣ 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘳 𝘣𝘦 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨?⁣ ⁣ 𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘥𝘦𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥 𝘧𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵?⁣ ⁣ This is how you get strategic with your storytelling, and deliver a message that isn’t just emotional or interesting, but brings you closer to your goal. ⁣ ⁣ And your feelings about leaving out such a great part? ... They’re valid, but not driving your decisions.⁣ ⁣ Think big picture. Think about your audience’s journey. ⁣ ⁣ And remind yourself - with this thoughtful, deliberate approach, everyone gets where you’re taking them - without being derailed by diversions and still in a way that lets them enjoy the ride."
