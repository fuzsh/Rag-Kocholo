        "text": "Twickenham Film Studios, recently used for The Iron Lady and My Week with Marilyn, has gone into administration.\n\nThe renowned studio, which was due to celebrate its centenary next year, will be wound down between now and June.\n\nGerald Krasner, who is handling the administration, said the business had lost money over the past three years.\n\n\"I doubt it will be retained as a film studio,\" he said. Half of the 17 employees have already left.\n\nThe remainder are working their notice, Mr Krasner added.\n\n\"We are selling it on,\" he told the BBC News website. \"Everyone will then be paid in full.\"\n\nClassic movies shot at Twickenham, which opened in 1913, include include Sherlock Holmes film The Missing Rembrandt, made in the 1930s, and the Beatles films Help and A Hard Day's Night.\n\nRoman Polanski's Repulsion, Alfie starring Michael Caine and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning also made use of its facilities.\n\nMore recently War Horse and Horrid Henry: The Movie were made there, while director Phyllida Lloyd completed post-production on The Iron Lady at the historic studios."
