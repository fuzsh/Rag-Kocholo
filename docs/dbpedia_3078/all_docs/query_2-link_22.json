        "text": "Twickenham Film Studios, which have been used for films as diverse as Roman Polanski's Repulsion, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and current Oscars hopeful My Week with Marilyn, are to be closed just one year ahead of the facility's centennial anniversary.\n\nAdministrator Gerald Krasner said the business was losing money and would be wound down between now and June, with half of its 17 employees having already left. It was unlikely to be maintained as a film studio by new owners, he said. \"We are selling it on,\" Mr Krasner told the BBC News website. \"Everyone will then be paid in full.\"\n\nTwickenham opened in 1913 as St Margaret's Studios and was given its current moniker in 1929 by one of its most famous owners, British film magnate Julius Hagen. Built on the site of a former ice rink, it was the largest studio in the country during the era and is still considered one of the UK's pre-eminent film-making facilities alongside Pinewood and Shepperton studios.\n\nLast year Steven Spielberg's War Horse was partly shot on site, while Phyllida Lloyd's Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady made use of the post-production facilities. My Week with Marilyn borrowed the site's viewing theatre and wardrobe department for Simon Curtis' retelling of the short, fraught shoot for Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier's ill-fated 1957 film The Prince and the Showgirl.\n\nEarlier in its history, Twickenham was a home from home for the Beatles, who filmed Help and A Hard Day's Night there. Hagen began his tenure at the site by shooting \"quota quickies\", taking advantage of the legal requirement for US studios to make a number of films in Britain each year in return for permission to release their movies in UK cinemas. However, he later oversaw production of better known films such as 1935's Scrooge, starring Seymour Hicks as Charles Dickens' famous miser, and 1936 historical drama Spy of Napoleon.\n\nAfter the war, and Hagen's bankruptcy, the 1960s saw two classic Michael Caine films, Alfie and The Italian Job, filmed at Twickenham. Other movies which used the studio's facilities include 1981 John Landis comedy horror An American Werewolf in London, 1988 crime caper A Fish Called Wanda and Karel Reisz's 1960 blue collar Brit drama Saturday night and Sunday Morning, starring a young Albert Finney.\n\nTwickenham may have struggled to compete with other, larger UK film studios that have more modern facilities, such as Pinewood in Buckinghamshire or 3 Mills in the East End. Accounts for the year ending in March 2011 suggest the company made a loss of more than Â£400,000 over 12 months.\n\n\"I think it is a real shame that Twickenham's closing,\" key grip Rupert Lloyd Parry, who worked on both The Iron Lady and My Week with Marilyn, told the BBC. \"It's one of our older studios. It's nice when you work where you feel like there's a real sort of tradition of the British film industry. It's like working at Ealing, places like that.\n\n\"The film industry is buoyant at the moment, there is work coming in. There doesn't seem like there is any reason for it to shut.\"\n\nFilm and TV production at the studios is due to be wound down over the next few months ahead of a planned sale by June.\n\nFive films that Twickenham built\n\nA Hard Day's Night (1964)\n\nInterior scenes for the Beatles' first and best feature film were shot on stages one and three at Twickenham, and director Richard Lester retained an office on site until as recently as last year. The fab four returned a year later to shoot follow-up Help, and also used the studio's rehearsal rooms while preparing to record their 1969 album Let it Be.\n\nRepulsion (1965)\n\nRoman Polanski's murky psychological horror is set largely in south Kensington, the smart, well-heeled district contrasting powerfully with Catherine Deneuve's grim internal torment. Many scenes were shot on location, but the fluxing interior of Deneuve's apartment was shot at Twickenham's stage three, along with a number of other indoor scenes.\n\nAlfie (1966)\n\nMichael Caine famously broke the fourth wall convention to talk straight to camera in Lewis Gilbert's tale of a callous cockney womaniser in swinging 60s London. Twickenham studios, which were used for interior scenes, were conveniently close to York House and Gardens in York Street, Twickenham, which doubled for the sanatorium where Alfie recuperates and seduces a fellow patient's wife.\n\nMy Week with Marilyn (2011)\n\nThe Oscar-nominated period piece took advantage of Twickenham's old-fashioned interiors to conjure up images of life on a 1950s London film set, borrowing the studio's wardrobe department and one of its theatres. In real life, The Prince and the Showgirl, which united Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe in a famously uneasy collaboration, was shot at Pinewood studios.\n\nWar Horse (2011)\n\nSections filmed at Twickenham for the first world war tearjerker include an early scene in the kitchen of the Devon farmhouse which is home to Jeremy Irvine's Albert Narracott, and a later scene in a French windmill where colt Joey is being stabled."
