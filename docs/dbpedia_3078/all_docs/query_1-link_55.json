        "text": "Man in the Mirror (1936)\n\nA watchable film in which Edward Everett Horton makes one of his periodic professional visits to England to play both leading roles - Jeremy Dilke and his alter-ego (the man in the mirror). Alastair, as was the case at this stage of his film career, merely has a cameo role, as the Interpreter to the Bogus of Bokhara and spends most of his time talking a pidgeon-eastern gibberish in an attempt to con leading London businessmen out of their wealth. Much of the humor between Alastair's character and the Bogus would probably not be considered acceptable in today's politically correct culture but is mildly amusing all the same. Full synopsis\n\nInterpreter: He say \"Here's mud in your eye\". Dilke's Alter-ego: The East has moved much nearer the West since I studied Geography.\n\nInterpreter: His highness, he not recognise the English interpretation. In Bokhara it is only played on castanets after dinner when the wind is in the East.\n\nMaurice Elvey had been one of the major European film makers of the teens but the British industry was unable to supply him with projects of comparable ambition and he spent a lot of the thirties taking on vehicles for visiting US stars - here Edward Everett Horton.\n\nThe staging of this film is elaborate: the studio constructed tube train station; exclusive London West End hotel; and Chinese restaurant; etc. Elvey's handling is also accomplished. Watch the wide shot of the office where the two Hortons move round conducting a conversation with the correct eye lines and timing."
