        "text": "Film was a most important product in the lives of the people during the 1930s. This paper sets out to analyse the underlying economic arrangements of the film industries of the U.S. and Britain during the decade in producing and diffusing this commodity-type to the population at large. In doing this, the paper finds a highly competitive industry that was built around showing films that audiences wanted to see, irrespective of the extent of vertical integration. It also examines the nature of the inter-relationship between the two industries and finds an asymmetry between the popularity of British films in the American market and that of American films in the British market. Our explanation for this is that the efforts of British firms on the American market were not sufficiently sustained to make a significant impact on American audiences\n\nThis is a much expanded version of the paper I prepared for the 2009 SERCIA conference and eventually published among the collected papers in 2012. James Chapman kindly allowed me to publish a long version in the HJFR+TV in Dec, 2012. Would have liked to expand further but difficult to attract funding for the 30s!\n\nThe historiography of post-war British cinema has been dominated by the notion of the ‘Lost Continent’: a large body of work which was excluded by the realist critical establishment, in favour of ‘quality’ British films and, later, continental art cinema. ‘Return to the Lost Continent’ argues that the image of the critical establishment at the centre of this perspective is based on a flawed account of British film culture derived from a narrow range of evidence. Using newly accessible print sources, it aims to challenge the consensus view of British film culture before and after the Second World War, in particular by revealing the extent of the distribution of European films in and outside London, customarily and wrongly represented as an affair of the social elite."
