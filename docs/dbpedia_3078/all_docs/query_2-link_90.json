        "text": "THE LAMENTS\n\nBy George Hagen\n\n370 pages. Random House. $24.95.\n\nLament is the family name of the main characters in George Hagen's debut novel. But it doesn't entirely suit them; they aren't as sad as all that. The Laments are more like the Itinerants, the Misfits or the Eternal Outsiders. Mr. Hagen prefers to give them a name that is more mellifluous and dramatic than circumstances warrant.\n\nOver all, ''The Laments'' has a similar quality of exaggeration. As a light, charming first novel about a memorably eccentric family it has obvious appeal; this is an enjoyable, inviting book liable to attract attention. But it has less substance than its scope and format suggest. As the Laments roam all over the globe, experiencing their share of quirky epiphanies and freakish accidents, Mr. Hagen's nimble, semi-autobiographical story is marred only by the fact that its punch lines seems to be missing.\n\n''The Laments'' begins with a mixup that marks it as John Irving Lite, however oxymoronic that may be. The firstborn of Julia and Howard Lament is borrowed by another new mother. Soon afterward, she and the baby wind up in a deadly car wreck.\n\nAmends come to the Laments in the form of this other woman's orphaned, runty baby, described variously as ''the little urchin'' and ''the incubator waif.'' He will grow up to be the central character in a book that seems headed for a final plot twist linked to his curious origins. It's a twist that never really comes.\n\nThe Laments name the boy Will because he has unmistakable tenacity. He will need it, as the family (like the author's) is frequently uprooted and transported from one continent to another. The nominal reason for all these moves is Howard's job as an engineer: ''It's not like being a spy or an actor, but it can be just as exciting,'' he tells people at parties. But the real reason is an inbred restlessness that turns ''Laments travel'' into the family motto.\n\nIn the late 1950's they are in Rhodesia, where racism and imperialism -- two predominant motifs of the book -- first make themselves felt. So does the dreaminess that makes Howard want to irrigate the Sahara. Will grows into an inquisitive boy who sometimes wonders what he is doing in the midst of such a strange bunch. He does not know his true origins, and he has younger twin brothers, Marcus and Julius, who share their parents' wry outlook. When someone says she hopes not to drive the Laments crazy, Julius remarks, ''Too late for that.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
