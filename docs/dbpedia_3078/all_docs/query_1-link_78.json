They wanted to build a modern studio outside of the fog of London, but close enough for the ease of actors, supplies and distribution. They also wanted enough land to make a wide variety of films. They located this beautiful piece of land just outside of London at Elstree. Well..... they THOUGHT it was Elstree. The railway was the dividing line between Elstree and Borehamwood and the sign said Elstree Station. They happened to buy land on the Borehamwood side.\n\nHere's a map and breakdown of the studios and their histories:\n\n1\n\nNeptune\n\n2\n\nBritish National\n\n3\n\nImperial\n\n4\n\nWhitehall\n\n5\n\nAmalgamated\n\n6\n\nDanziger\n\n1.
