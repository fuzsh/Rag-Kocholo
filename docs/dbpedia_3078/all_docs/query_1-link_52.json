        "text": "The iconic Twickenham Film Studios, where hundreds of classic movies have been filmed, has entered administration, and is set to close by June this year when the last of its 17 employees will leave.\n\nThe administrator, Gerald Krasner of Begbies Traynor Group, says that the business has lost money for each of the last three years. Though the business is being wound down, there is every chance that the studios will continue to be used by the film industry and it is certainly up for sale.\n\nTwickenham was at the forefront of British filmmaking throughout the 20th century. Alfie, starring Michael Caine, was filmed there, as was Roman Polanski's Repulsion and it was used by the Beatles for A Hard Dayâ€™s Night and Help. Its success has continued into recent years, with the cinematic landmark being used for the production of The Iron Lady, Warhorse and My Week with Marilyn.\n\nSadly, the famous studio would have celebrated its centenary next year. It was originally set up as St Margaret's Studios by Dr Ralph Jupp in 1913. In 1929 the studios were taken over by the entrepreneurial film producer Julius Hagen (pictured) and renamed Twickenham Film Studios. By 1933 Hagen had transformed the business and was producing up to 20 films a year at the studios.\n\nIn 1935, a fire completely destroyed the old studios at the site. It was underinsured and the loss contributed to the collapse of the three businesses based there, Twickenham Studios, Twickenham Film Distributors and JH Productions, two years later.\n\nFollowing further bomb damage in World War II, and an ensuing quiet period, the studios enjoyed a renaissance, and many in the British film industry are now hoping that history again repeats itself.\n\nShare this article"
