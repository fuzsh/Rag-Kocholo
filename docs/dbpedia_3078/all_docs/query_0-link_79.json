        "text": "Note: If you would like to add your name to this letter, please submit your name via this form. The list of signatories will be updated every few hours.\n\nWe, a diverse community of composers, musicians, educators, leaders, and allies, call for action regarding the allegations of a decades-long abuse of women and power by composer Robert Beaser.\n\nWhile his conduct is being third-party investigated, we call for his immediate placement on administrative leave from the faculty of The Juilliard School. Though we recognize and appreciate the need for due process, the volume of allegations, testimony, and supporting evidence of Beaser’s misconduct are undeniably unsettling. Until the investigation is resolved, Beaser’s presence in the Juilliard composition department could jeopardize the emotional well-being of students and inhibit a safe and healthy learning environment.\n\nWhen allegations are extensive and documented, as they are in this case, allowing the alleged perpetrator to remain in a position of power and authority risks not only a daily affront to survivors of abuse, harassment, and discrimination; it is also a potential endorsement of immoral, unethical, and bigoted behavior.\n\nSigned,\n\nVivian Fung, composer; The Juilliard School BM ’96, MM ’97, DMA ’02, faculty ‘02-’10\n\nSarah Kirkland Snider, composer and Co-Artistic Director, New Amsterdam Records\n\nNokuthula Ngwenyama, composer; performer, composer-in-residence, Phoenix Chamber Music Society; president EDI Records and producer/director Peace Mama Productions\n\nJudd Greenstein, composer and Co-Artistic Director, New Amsterdam Records\n\nTina Tallon, composer; Assistant Professor of AI and the Arts in Composition, University of Florida; Director of Composition, Cortona Sessions for New Music; Radcliffe Fellow ’21; FAAR ‘22\n\nSteven Mackey, William S.
