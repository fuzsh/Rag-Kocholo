        "text": "“Scrooge” is a retelling of Charles Dickens’ classic tale, “A Christmas Carol.” The 1935 film has been restored in color. This classic story centers on the miserly Victorian man who turns his back on Christmas and those around him. On Christmas Eve, four spirits visit him: his now-deceased partner in business, and the spirits of the past, present and future. They come to show him the errors of his ways and change his miserly and selfish attitude.\n\n“Scrooge” is a delightful version of one of Dickens’ classics. We are proud to award it the Dove Family Approved Seal for all ages."
