Below are some examples of how it is used.\n\nJim: You shouldn't drive so fast, Jerry!\n\nJerry: Well, didn’t you just get a speeding ticket last week? People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones!\n\nMaggie: Matt's room is always a mess. He needs to clean more often!\n\nMom: You're room isn’t clean either, Maggie. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.\n\nBecause this proverb is so widely known, it is often shortened. Below is an example of this.\n\nKevin: I can't believe Aaron just quit another job. Isn’t that the fourth one this year?\n\nKim: And how many jobs have you had this year? People who live in glass houses…\n\nI hope this helps."
