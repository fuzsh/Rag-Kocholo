        "text": "What are the lyrics to anchors aweigh?\n\nFrom the U.S. Navy Website: Original Lyrics [Verse 1] Stand Navy down the field, sails set to the sky. We'll never change our course, so Army you steer shy-y-y-y. Roll up the score, Navy, Anchors Aweigh. Sail Navy down the field and sink the Army, sink the Army Grey. [Verse 2] Get underway, Navy, Decks cleared for the fray, We'll hoist true Navy Blue So Army down your Grey-y-y-y. Full speed ahead, Navy; Army heave to, Furl Black and Grey and Gold and hoist the Navy, hoist the Navy Blue [Verse 3] Blue of the Seven Seas; Gold of God's great sun Let these our colors be Till all of time be done-n-n-ne, By Severn shore we learn Navy's stern call: Faith, courage, service true With honor over, honor over all. Revised Lyrics by Revised Lyrics of 1997 by MCPON John Hagen, USN (Ret) It is Verse 2 that is most widely sung. [Verse 1] Stand Navy out to sea, Fight our battle cry; We'll never change our course, So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y. Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh. Sail on to victory And sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray! [Verse 2] Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh. Farewell to foreign shores, We sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay. Through our last night ashore, Drink to the foam, Until we meet once more. Here's wishing you a happy voyage home. [Verse 3] Blue of the mighty deep: Gold of God's great sun. Let these our colors be Till all of time be done, done, done, done. On seven seas we learn Navy's stern call: Faith, courage, service true, With honor, over honor, over all."
