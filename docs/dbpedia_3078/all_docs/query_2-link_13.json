        "text": "The Passing of Mr. Quinn is a 1928 British mystery film which was co-directed by Leslie S. Hiscott and Julius Hagen, starring Clifford Heatherley, Mary Brough and Ursula Jeans. The film was based on the short story The Coming of Mr Quin, part of the collection The Mysterious Mr. Quin, which was written by Agatha Christie. It was the first British film to be made of one of Christie's works. The short story was adapted by Hiscott, who would in 1931 direct Alibi, the first film to feature Christie's more well known Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The film was made at Twickenham Studios in London.\n\nThe plot deviates radically from Christie's short story (for example, whereas Christie's Mr Quin is a romantic fantasy figure who solves the mystery of Professor Appleby's suicide, Mr Quinn is here portrayed as Appleby's alcoholic murderer).\n\nThe screenplay was novelised by G Roy McRae for issue in 1929 (London Book Company).\n\nPartial cast[]\n\nStewart Rome as Dr. Alec Portal\n\nTrilby Clark as Mrs. Eleanor Appleby\n\nUrsula Jeans as Vera, the Maid\n\nClifford Heatherley as Prof. Appleby\n\nMary Brough as Cook\n\nVivian Baron as Derek Cappel\n\nKate Gurney as Landlady\n\nPlot[]\n\nProfessor Appleby has terrorised his wife, Eleanor, but when he is murdered, and her lover, Derek goes missing, Eleanor suspects the worst. A mysterious stranger, known as 'Mr Quinny' or 'Mr Quinn' appears, and begins to seduce Eleanor, but his alcoholism takes over and he dies. Before dying, he reveals that he was Derek all along, and offers the girl to a rival, who promises to make Eleanor a happy wife.\n\nNaming[]\n\nThe title of the film spells the name Q-u-i-n-n, and not Q-u-i-n as in Christie's short stories.\n\n[]"
