Every state has different rules, so check with your state or local election office for the specific procedures. Typically:\n\nYou would take the ballot you received in the mail to your designated polling place on Election Day.\n\nDepending on your state's rules, you might exchange your uncast absentee ballot for an in-person ballot, or complete your absentee ballot and hand it in, or cast a provisional ballot.\n\nKnow your options for returning your absentee or vote-by-mail ballot\n\nCheck with your state or local election office to learn about other ways to return your ballot besides postal mail. Some states have ballot drop boxes. Many let you return your ballot in person at your local election office or another location.\n\nWho can and cannot vote absentee\n\nMilitary members and families stationed outside their legal voting residence can vote absentee.\n\nU.S. citizens outside of the U.S. who used to live in the U.S. can vote absentee.\n\nU.S. citizens born outside the U.S. who have never resided in the U.S. may not be able to vote absentee. Check the rules of the state where the personâs parent or legal guardian last resided.\n\nRegister and request an absentee ballot in one step\n\nIf you are a military member or family member or a U.S. citizen outside of the U.S., you can register to vote and request an absentee ballot in one step.
