Sonny\n\nThe 2 reel extract T.9350 \"Across Europe\" is best edited back in, not (correctly) in the initial Paris Opera sequence, but during the finale to balance the music content in this Pathéscope cut-down.\n\nMinor story about a radio broadcast from a cruise ship provides vehicle for a number of musical & variety items:-\n\n\"The Band That Jack Built\" Jack Hylton & Orchestra\n\n\"Nothing On Earth\" June Clyde\n\n\"Sailing Along On A Carpet of Clouds\"\n\n\"Do The Run Around\" June Clyde\n\n\"Don't Ask (Any) Questions\" Brian Lawrence\n\n\"Moanin' Minnie\" Diana Ward\n\nNovelty number by Alex Templeton\n\n\"Why Did She Fall For the Leader of the Band\" Leslie Carew\n\n\"May All Your Troubles Be Little Ones\"\n\n\"She Shall Have Music\" Jack Hylton & Orchestra - vocal probably Pat O'Malley\n\nplus: The Leon Woizikowsky Ballet; The Dalmora Can-Can Dancers; Carmora - Spanish Dancing Beauty; The Two Mackays - Harlem's Hottest Hoofers, Freddie Schweitzer, Magda Neeld - Australia's Star of Song, and exotic dancer Mathea Merryfield\n\n(Many numbers are shortened in this 9.5mm Pathéscope release, and another number \"My First Thrill\" sung by Brian Lawrence to June Clyde on the deck of the ship and later reprised by Sonny Farrah is completely missing. However the Alex Templeton item is missing from version shown on TV, but exists on 9.5!)\n\nJack Hylton, born in Lancashire, 2nd July 1892, the son of a publican, fronted the premier European show band in the 1930's.
