        "text": "WASHINGTON — Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, accused as the mastermind of al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, agreed to plead guilty, the Defense Department said Wednesday.\n\nThe development points to a long-delayed resolution in an attack that killed thousands and altered the course of the U.S. and much of the Middle East.\n\nMohammed and two accomplices, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, are expected to enter the pleas at the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as soon as next week.\n\nDefense lawyers requested the men receive life sentences in exchange for the guilty pleas, according to letters from the federal government received by relatives of some of the nearly 3,000 people killed outright on the morning of Sept. 11.\n\nTerry Strada, the head of one group of families of the nearly 3,000 direct victims of the 9/11 attacks, invoked the dozens of relatives who died while awaiting justice for the killings when she heard news of the plea agreement.\n\n\"They were cowards when they planned the attack,\" she said of the defendants. \"And they're cowards today.\"\n\nPentagon officials declined to immediately release the full terms of the plea bargains.\n\nThe U.S. agreement with the men came more than 16 years after their prosecution began for al-Qaida's attack. It came more than 20 years after militants commandeered four commercial airliners to use as fuel-filled missiles, flying three of them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon.\n\nAl-Qaida hijackers headed the fourth plane to Washington, but crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit, and the plane crashed into a Pennsylvania field.\n\nThe attack triggered what President George W. Bush's administration called its war on terror, prompting the U.S. military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and years of U.S. operations against armed extremist groups elsewhere in the Middle East.\n\nThe attack and U.S. retaliation brought the overthrow of two governments outright, devastated communities and countries caught in the battle, and played a role in inspiring the 2011 Arab Spring popular uprisings against authoritarian Middle East governments.\n\nAt home, the attacks inspired a sharply more militaristic and nationalist turn to American society and culture.\n\nU.S. authorities point to Mohammed as the source of the idea to use planes as weapons. He allegedly received approval from al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. forces killed in 2011, to craft what became the 9/11 hijackings and killings.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAuthorities captured Mohammed in 2003. He was subjected to waterboarding 183 times while in CIA custody before being sent to Guantanamo, and targeted by other forms of torture and coercive questioning.\n\nThe use of torture has proven one of the most formidable obstacles in U.S. efforts to try the men in the military commission at Guantanamo, owing to the inadmissibility of evidence linked to abuse. Torture accounted for much of the delay of the proceedings, along with the courtroom's location a plane ride away from the U.S.\n\nDaphne Eviatar, a director at the Amnesty International USA rights group, said Wednesday she welcomed news of some accountability in the attacks.\n\nShe urged the Biden administration to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which holds people taken into custody in the so-called war on terror. Many since were cleared but are awaiting approval to leave for other countries.\n\nAdditionally, Eviatar said, \"the Biden administration must also take all necessary measures to ensure that a program of state-sanctioned enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment will never be perpetrated by the United States again.\"\n\nStrada, national chairperson of a group of families of victims called 9/11 Families United, had been at Manhattan federal court for a hearing on one of many civil lawsuits when she heard news of the plea agreement.\n\nStrada said many families have just wanted to see the men admit guilt.\n\n\"For me personally, I wanted to see a trial,\" she said. \"And they just took away the justice I was expecting, a trial and the punishment.\"\n\nMichael Burke, one of the family members receiving the government notice of the plea bargain, condemned the long wait for justice, and the outcome.\n\n\"It took months or a year at the Nuremberg trials,\" said Burke, whose brother New York City fire Capt. Billy Burke died in the collapse of the World Trade Center's North Tower. \"To me, it always been disgraceful that these guys, 23 years later, have not been convicted and punished for their attacks, or the crime. I never understood how it took so long.\"\n\nBurke's brother ordered his men out but remained on the 27th floor of the North Tower with two men who'd stayed behind: a quadriplegic who, because the elevators were out, was essentially stuck there in his wheelchair and that man's friend.\n\nAlso Wednesday, lawyers for Saudi Arabia argued that the country fought against terrorism and al-Qaida in the 1990s and should not be a defendant in lawsuits seeking over $100 billion for relatives of people killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nU..S. District Judge George B. Daniels listened to arguments about evidence in the 2-decade-old Manhattan case.\n\nLawyers for relatives of 9/11 victims say a group of extremist religious leaders in Saudi Arabia gained influence in the Saudi government and aided the 9/11 hijackers who flew the planes in the attack. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 attackers were Saudis."
