In 1952, it was purchased by Andrew Smith Harkness to become the home of Harkness Screens, the manufacturer of cinema screens until 2003. Aerofilms, Britainâ€™s leading supplier of aerial photography, also had an office there.\n\nf. The building was demolished in 2004 to make room for a housing project of 133 homes.\n\nLooking for more information on exactly where the poverty bounds were.\n\nNearby cities:"
