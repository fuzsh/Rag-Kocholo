        "text": "Directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Ivor Novello, this rom-com provided an early role for a slim, young Jack Hawkins (playing a cockney loudmouth).\n\nIt was also an early chance for a young Ida Lupino to play the blond teenage sister, and impress audiences a year before she left for Hollywood.\n\nThe screenplay was adapted by Novello from his own play, the stage production of which he had also appeared in.\n\nIt is a well-crafted comedy, full of astute observation and tells the story of an illegitimate son of a Russian woman, who is the result of an affair that she had with Czar Nicholas II (or at least that’s his story).\n\nPLOT\n\nA young shop girl, Gladys Wallis (Ursula Jeans), meets an impoverished Russian Prince, Felix Lenieff (Novello). He is lounging on a bench in Hampton Court maze. When she learns that he has no place to stay, she takes him to her family home to Fulham.\n\nAt first her middle-class family members do not believe he is a prince, but he claims to have a locket that the Russian Czar, Nicholas II, gave to his mother.\n\nGladys’s father (Eliot Makeham) works in the diamond trade and confirms the jewels are valuable diamonds, but Felix does not want to sell them for their own sake.\n\nNevertheless, he is eventually persuaded to do so by Mr. Wallis, who points out that would benefit the family.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nNovello’s (strangely Welsh inflected?) Russian accent is hilariously camp and some have said he plays the role like a 1930s Kenneth Williams.\n\nBut his character drives the plot and Novello shows a rare ability to maintain a playful, ironic stance throughout.\n\nThe fast-paced dialogue and frenetic plotting are imbued with casual, but knowing, wit that gives the piece a modern flavour. The fickle prince is an exotic stranger and a temporary guest, who invades this suburban home, heedless of the trail of disruption he causes.\n\nUrsula Jeans is perfect as the good daughter, Gladys, while Ida Lupino – in only her fifth film – is all but unrecognizable as the fresh-faced cockney sister.\n\nJack Hawkins meanwhile (shown here) is far from the plummy-voiced character for which he would later become famous. He plays Gladys’ cocky boyfriend, whose nose is put oout of joint by the prince.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nMaurice Elvey (1887 – 1967) was already one of the most prolific directors in British cinema. He had directed sometimes more than a dozen films a year during the silent cinema period and his life itself could have been made into a movie.\n\nBorn in Stockton-on-Tees (Co. Durham, England), he had no formal education and had run away from home working on the streets of London at the age of nine.\n\nAt this time, during his stint as a page boy at the Hyde Park Hotel, he met a wealthy American, who inspired him to pursue a career in the theatre. Having become a stagehand, he moved into acting by the age of 17 and travelled to New York where, while working as a stage producer, he saw his first film.\n\nThis made such an impression that on his return to England he was determined to produce and direct films. He made his first in 1913, going on to direct an array of popular shorts in various genres. This included biographies but, in 1918, The Life Story of David Lloyd George (originally titled The Man Who Saved the Empire), was suppresses for political reasons.\n\nEmployed by the Fox Film Corporation in 1924, Elvey had made 5 films for them in America before returning to Europe the following year. The silent period saw Elvey direct some 130 films in a career that would span 44 years, 300 feature films and innumerable shorts.\n\nAmongst his “firsts” as a director, Elvey had already made Gaumont’s first talking film (High Treason, 1929) and he would make the first British colour film, Sons of the Sea (1939). Carol Reed and David Lean began their careers working for Elvey, and he directed Gracie Fields in her first movie, Sally in Our Alley (1931).\n\nIVOR NOVELLO (1893 – 1951)\n\nA composer, a musician, a playwright, a screenwriter, a theatre actor and producer, and – as shown in this film – a gifted comedy actor, Novello was born David Ivor Davies in Cardiff.\n\nThe son of David, a rent collector for the council and Clara, a singing teacher, young Davids’ prodigious musical abilities were noticed early. He was educated privately in Cardiff then Gloucester, before winning a scholarship to the Magdalen College Choir School, Oxford, and had his first song published when he was only 15.\n\nAfter leaving school, he taught piano in Cardiff before moving to London aged 20 with his mother. They took a flat above the Strand, which became his London home for the rest of his life. It was here he adopted his mother’s middle name (Novello) as his professional name and the following year wrote “Keep the Home Fires Burning.” The song encapsulated the feelings of innumerable families torn apart by the war and earned him a fortune.\n\nHaving become an overnight celebrity at the age of 21, Novello was able to avoid enlistment until 23 (in June 1916), when he reported to a Royal Naval Air Service but, after twice crashing aeroplanes, it was arranged to have him moved to the Admiralty office in central London for the rest of the war.\n\nHe continued to write songs while in the RNAS and also took to writing scores for musicals, meeting the actor Bobbie Andrews (who was to become his life partner) and at this time too met Noel Coward, six years Novello’s junior and deeply envious of his effortless glamour. At the same time, Novello was making a career as an actor and was offered the romantic lead in The Call of Blood (1920).\n\nThe following year saw him in his first British film, Carnival, and his stage debut, before appearing in his first American film, D.W. Griffith’s The White Rose in 1923. There followed several film roles, including Hitchcock’s The Lodge (1927) and by the end of the decade Novello had been dubbed Britain’s most popular and “handsomest” screen actor.\n\nA successful Broadway production of his comic play, The Truth Game, quickly brought him to the attention of Hollywood and he accepted a contract to write for and appear in MGM films. But he found little to do in Hollywood beyond writing dialogue for Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and returned to London to star in the sound remake of The Lodger (1932).\n\nNovello had a fine, well-modulated speaking voice that transferred easily to talkies. He wrote and starred in Symphony in Two Flats (1930) and went on to remake The Phantom Fiend (1932) even while writing dialogue for Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), after which he decided to devote himself full time to music and theatre.\n\nIn his career, Novello would write over 250 songs, most of them uplifting, touchingly sentimental and war-inspired morale boosters.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nI Lived with You is a well-produced, directed and acted film, that benefits from a time of crisis in cinema. After the Depression, American studios had cut production and started outsourcing films to fill their cinemas with cheap so-called ‘quota quickies’.\n\nAt London Films, Alexander Korda had satisfied a consequent demand for big budget films with Henry VIII, starring Charles Laughton, Merle Oberon, Elsa Lanchester, Robert Donat.\n\nSeeing a gap in the market, Julius Hagen, a German émigré who ran his own studio at Twickenham, thought to copy Korda and abandoned ‘quota quickies’ to invest in high quality films like I Lived with You.\n\nThere were not many English films in 1933 made this well or quite so entertaining today.\n\nIn May 1996 the world premiere of Maurice Elvey’s long-lost The Life Story of David Lloyd George (1918) took place in Cardiff, more than 70 years later than scheduled. The circumstances of the suppression of this three-hour film have still not been fully explained.\n\nThe film was acclaimed by cinema historians as a milestone in film making, and it is believed that had it been released in 1918, as originally planned, it may well have changed the course of British cinema."
