Abstract

This chapter provides an overview of production practices in the British film industry over a fifty year period. It does this through an analysis of the role of the producer, dividing producers into three broad types: moguls (who owned a studio); A feature producers (involved in quality productions) and artisans (B feature producers who survived by volume production). Following a wide-ranging introduction that surveys the role of the producer and its importance, three case studies are provided to give detailed, in-depth analysis: Julius Hagen (artisan); Joseph Janni (A feature producer); and Nat Cohen (mogul), whose careers collectively span the entire period.
