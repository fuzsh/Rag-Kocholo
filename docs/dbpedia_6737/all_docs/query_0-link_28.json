Leaving their roots behind, turning their backs on centuries of Jewish history, the sabras were intended to become the antithesis of the Diaspora Jew. Whereas the latter was perceived by Zionist ideologues as weak and passive, the sabras were envisioned as farmers and warriors, masters of their own historical fate. Dahn Ben-Amotz—writer, journalist, actor, and radio personality—exhibited these traits perhaps more than any other member of his generation.\n\nBorn Mosse Tehilimzeigger, Ben-Amotz was sent to Palestine from Poland by his parents during his early teens. In Palestine he attended the Ben Shemen agricultural school, which was one of the grooming grounds for the emerging Israeli political and military elite. (His counselor was Shimon Peres.) Ben-Amotz soon realized that in order to blend into the new culture, he had to rid himself of any signs of the Diaspora. He changed his name, first to Moshe Shimony and later to Dahn Ben-Amotz, which he felt possessed the right sabra sound. He also reinvented his personal history, claiming to be an orphan with relatives in some of the older Zionist settlements. For years Ben-Amotz would claim that he was a true sabra.\n\nIn the 1940s during the fight for Israeli independence, Ben-Amotz served in an elite underground movement, but he spent the years of the War of Independence in Europe as an emissary of the young state. There he discovered another side of Europe—not the home of Diaspora Judaism that he was taught to despise but rather Europe as a cultural center. After the war he served a short stint as a Paris correspondent for Israeli papers, hoping to hone his writing skills in that intellectual hub. This was followed by an extended visit to the United States that included a stay in Hollywood, where he mingled with the likes of Marlon Brando and Shelly Winters, who were captivated by this \"noble savage\" from the romantic East. (He had a speaking part in A Streetcar Named Desire. )\n\nHis return to Israel in the 1950s signaled the beginning of Ben-Amotz's rise to prominence in the Israeli cultural arena. He was the driving force behind the creation of the radio show \"Three Men in a Boat,\" a weekly satirical review that became the country's most popular show, and he wrote regularly for Israeli newspapers. As a public personality Ben-Amotz epitomized the sabra ethos of strength and self-confidence. He was one of the leading voices of a new culture that created a vibrant, modern language that turned its back on tradition. This was most evident with the publication in 1972 of his dictionary of Hebrew slang, written with Netiva Ben Yehuda, that gave an official seal of approval to the legitimacy of the sabra way of life.\n\nBen-Amotz's literature, however, revealed another, more vulnerable, side of sabra culture. His short story \"Parents Meeting\" (1962), drawing on autobiographical motives, revealed the hardships of the new immigrants in an Israeli boarding school in the pre-state era. In the screenplay for the movie Siege (1968) in which he also acted, Ben-Amotz exposed the difficulties that a war widow faces in militaristic Israeli society. And in the novel Does Not Give a Damn (1973) he told of the travails of a soldier wounded in battle and his rehabilitation efforts.\n\nWhile for years Ben-Amotz concealed the truth about his past and presented himself as a native Israeli (in his later years he dressed in an Arab jalabia and lived in an old Arab house in Jaffa), in his novel To Remember, To Forget (1968) he revealed some autobiographical motifs to which he would admit only much later in life. The novel's protagonist, like Ben-Amotz himself, is a young man who lost his family in the Holocaust and attempted (by changing his name) to re-create himself as a true sabra. The novel was Ben-Amotz's major attempt to deal with the memory of the Holocaust and with the attitudes of Israeli society toward it. In the 1980s Ben-Amotz was diagnosed with cancer. When his disease became known to the public, he also brought to light the truth about his personal history. He made a much-publicized trip to Poland that included a tour of Auschwitz. He told friends that in the visitor's book in Auschwitz he signed under the name Mosse Tehilimzeigger. This was a symbolic gesture that exposed the dual nature of the sabra ethos—repressing the past but at the same time being constantly forced to remember it with all its horrors as an integral part of the collective Jewish experience.\n\n—Eran Kaplan"
