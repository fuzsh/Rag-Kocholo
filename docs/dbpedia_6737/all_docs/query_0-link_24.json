        "text": "When governments prove inept, the grass roots takes over. It happened to America in Vietnam. It is a democratic principle as basic as the vote itself.\n\nThere are growing signs the escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians will be broken by the grass roots. People are fed up.\n\nPolls show Israel has lost confidence in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, elected a year ago on a platform of peace and security. Israelis are worse off than they were a year ago, and they know it. Sharon takes as bad a beating in Israel’s press as does Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nFive days ago, Amnon Dankner, editor of the daily Maariv, described Sharon’s promises of peace and security as “lying on the side of the road we have traveled this year, rusting like junked cars.” How long, Dankner asked, “before the public rises up and the morale of the army reaches a dangerous low?”\n\nNot much longer.\n\nIt comes as no great surprise that Israel’s latest grass-roots peace movement comes from the military. Sharon received his first jolt last month when some 100 (now up to 250) reserve soldiers and officers signed a letter refusing to serve in the Palestinian territories.\n\nNow Sharon has a new challenge.\n\nThe Council for Peace and Security, a group of 1,000 top-level reserve generals and colonels, and Shin Bet and Mossad officials are mounting a public campaign for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from all of Gaza and most of the West Bank.\n\nUnder the plan, some 50 Jewish settlements would be dismantled, a Palestinian state immediately could be established, and peace talks on issues such as Jerusalem would begin with or without a cease-fire.\n\nCouncil president Danny Rothschild, a reserve major general, explained the organization’s thinking:\n\n“Four months ago it was clear to me that the (resistance) movement would grow if we continue calling up reserves to accompany settlers (in the occupied territories) to music lessons and to protect real estate that has nothing to do with ideology.”\n\nFrom a security perspective, said Rothschild, “it was clear that those two jeeps and a tank that accompany a settler who refuses to use a bypass road would do much more good if they were on the seam.”\n\nThe “seam” is the Green Line, Israel’s eastern border before the 1967 war. Under the council’s plan, some Jewish settlements would be preserved east of the Green Line.\n\nThe council is not led by Israel’s usual dove suspects in Peace Now and Meretz. It is made up of former fighters who understand when force works and when it does not. It has grown out of the reserve resistance movement.\n\nThere is an interesting political difference between Israeli and U.S. military officers. Israel’s officers are not all hawks. While polls show that three-fourths of U.S. military officers identify with the Republican Party, Israel’s Labor Party has produced the lion’s share of its top military men, including both Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, leaders of the land-for-peace movement in the 1990s.\n\nIsrael’s most outspoken enemies of land for peace come from the religious community, people raised under laws that exempt yeshiva (seminary) students from the military draft and years of reserve service. (Interestingly, that exemption is again before the Israeli Supreme Court, which could end it and change the political dynamic.)\n\nYigal Amir, the religious law student who murdered Rabin to stop peace negotiations in 1995, said he did it because religious law took precedence over secular law, and that Rabin had no right to give back Palestinian land that religious leaders wanted to keep.\n\nThe military rationale for the council’s plan is simple: It would enhance prospects for peace and security.\n\n“The negotiations for a permanent agreement must be based on Oslo (the decade-long peace negotiations),” says Rothschild. “But an army commander cannot be dogmatic. When conditions change on the ground, he must change his behavior. If Oslo is dead, it’s because we killed it, and now we’re shooting. Now there’s no choice but to do what’s best for us.”\n\nIf revisionist thinking is occurring among some Israelis, so is it among some Arabs. In its outlines, the council’s plan is similar to one raised last week by Prince Abdullah, the Saudi leader: Israel returns the occupied Arab lands in return for full recognition by Arab states.\n\nAbdullah’s plan of land for peace is not new. What is new is that it comes from Saudi Arabia, the keeper of Islam’s flame. It is a forthright offer from an influential, fundamentalist regime.\n\nThe problem in all this is Sharon. Like his religious supporters, Sharon does not believe in land for peace; he believes Israel is better off with the land and without the peace.\n\nThat is precisely the policy that has led to impasse and violence. The growing resistance inside the army may provide the only way out.\n\nThe resistance movement is hardly assured victory, for the religious right is pushing Sharon toward all-out war.\n\nThings hang precariously in the balance. The Bush administration, so ineffective in this struggle, should get involved while there is still time."
