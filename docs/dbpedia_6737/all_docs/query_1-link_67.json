        "text": "Natalie Portman, born as Neta-Lee Hershlag in 1981, is a highly acclaimed actress and filmmaker with dual Israeli and American citizenship. Her talent for acting was evident from an early age when she was discovered by an agent in a pizza parlor at the age of eleven. Despite her young age, Natalie's determination led to her film debut in Luc Besson's thriller Léon: The Professional. Since then, she has graced both the big screen and stage with performances that have received numerous accolades. Portman's acting career is marked by diverse roles across different genres. In 1999, she gained global recognition for her role as Queen Amidala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. She further showcased her versatility through films like V for Vendetta, where she famously shaved her head on camera for the role, and Black Swan which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress due to its intense portrayal of a ballet dancer's descent into madness. Outside of acting, Portman attended Harvard University where she studied psychology while still maintaining a successful career in Hollywood - proving herself not only talented but also intellectually formidable. Dedicated to various causes such as animal rights and environmental issues; Portman utilizes her platform effectively towards activism work too. As a filmmaker, she made her directorial debut with A Tale of Love and Darkness which premiered at Cannes Film Festival – showcasing another facet of this multitalented artist's capabilities.\n\nBar Refaeli, a name synonymous with beauty and grace, is an Israeli supermodel, actress, and entrepreneur. Born on June 4, 1985 in Hod HaSharon, Israel, she was destined for the spotlight from the start, as her parents owned a successful horse ranch and were involved in the fashion industry. Her mother, Tzipi Levine, was also a successful model in the 1970s. Refaeli's early exposure to this world fostered in her a passion for fashion and modeling, which led her to start her modeling career at just eight months old. Refaeli's career trajectory took a significant leap when she won the title of \"Model of the Year\" in an Israeli beauty contest in 2000. This achievement catapulted her into the international scene, leading her to work with some of the biggest names in the fashion industry such as Chanel, Escada, Ralph Lauren, and Victoria's Secret. In 2009, she reached a milestone in her career by becoming the first Israeli model to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine, solidifying her status as an international icon. Beyond her successful modeling career, Refaeli is also known for her entrepreneurial spirit and philanthropic efforts. She co-founded an e-commerce company, Under.me, and played an active role in its operations and promotion. Moreover, she has been involved in various philanthropic activities, using her public platform to raise awareness for important causes. She hosted a television special for the Peres Center for Peace, which promotes peace and innovation in the Middle East. Despite her glamorous lifestyle and successful career, Refaeli remains grounded, attributing her success to her Israeli upbringing and strong family values."
