Do you want to know what just happened in the news or ponder a sharp analysis by a top writer from Sof Hashavua such as Ben Caspit, Amnon Dankner, Ronen Shoval or Avi Benayahu? Are you interested in breaking business developments from Forbes Israel or the juiciest gossip from the legendary Liora? Maybe you’re in the mood to listen to an interesting radio talk show or watch a sensational goal from the English Premier League? Well now you can, after Eli Azur’s Jerusalem Post Group launched this week what promises to be Israel’s hottest news website: The Post, at thepost.co.il.The Post brings together material in Hebrew from, inter alia, The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem Post Lite, Israel Post, Sof Hashavua, Forbes Israel, Sport 1 and Sport 2 television, as well as Eco 99 and 103 FM radio. Doron Cohen, editor of The Post, said the site has something for everyone. “In addition to constantly covering the news and current events, we are offering added value of the highest quality in the form of Israel’s most important journalists,” said Cohen, who previously headed the NRG website. “This is an extraordinary initiative uniting under one roof: print, radio and television in a variety of fields that everyone will find interesting.” Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO of The Jerusalem Post Group, added: “Everyone and everything is there at the click of a mouse! Caspit, Dankner, Liora and dozens of our most popular writers. There has never been anything like it in Israel!” Steve Linde, editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post, said The Post represents Israel at its best. “The Jerusalem Post has developed an international reputation during the course of its rich 80- year history,” said Linde. “Our English website, JPost.com, attracts hundreds of thousands of local and international readers a day. The Post, in Hebrew, presents a potpourri of modern media, offering a glimpse into the future.”"
