        "text": "Mideast Crisis\n\nJERUSALEM (AP -- Pictures of a\n\nrefugee camp turned to mountainous rubble, weeping Palestinian women and shell-shocked\n\nchildren, a row of white-shrouded bodies. Israel says these scenes of misery\n\nand devastation present an unfair image of the battle of Jenin, and it is gearing\n\nup for a new battle for world opinion.\n\nIn eight days of ferocious house-to-house\n\nfighting, Israeli forces captured and leveled the center of the Jenin refugee\n\ncamp, home to some 13,000 Palestinians and a stronghold of militants. Scores\n\nof Palestinian gunmen had turned parts of the camp into a fortress, vowing to\n\nfight to the death.\n\nThe Palestinians accuse Israel of\n\na massacre, claiming hundreds of fighters and civilians were killed. Israel\n\nsaid fewer than 100 Palestinians died, mostly fighters, and that most civilians\n\nheeded Israeli warnings broadcast on loudspeakers and evacuated the area.\n\nSo far 43 bodies have been recovered\n\n-- including 11 young adult men, and six women, children or elderly men -- according\n\nto hospital authorities in Jenin. It is not known how many more bodies were\n\nunder the layers of concrete -- as digging began to step up after Israel's withdrawal\n\nfrom the camp Friday.\n\nBut Israel already is preparing\n\nto make its case. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to send\n\na fact-finding mission to Jenin to find out what happened. Israel backed the\n\ndecision, saying it had nothing to hide. There is a strong feeling among Israelis\n\nthat the intense focus on the issue and language used to describe the battle\n\nare -- whether intentionally or not -- perpetuating the myth of a massacre and\n\nserving anti-Israel propaganda.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive in\n\nthe West Bank on March 29, aiming to crush militants after a series of suicide\n\nbombings. Its forces moved into Jenin on April 3.\n\nPHOTO: RUBBLE: A Palestinian\n\nflag is draped Saturday over a destroyed area of the Jenin refugee camp. The\n\nU.N.

(AP\n\nphoto\n\n(End of published text\n\nand battled until Palestinian resistance\n\nin the camp largely collapsed eight days later.\n\nIsraelis have complained that the\n\nworld is ignoring what they consider Israel's restraint, compared to what the\n\nRussian army wrought in Chechnya, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the U.S.\n\ncampaign in Afghanistan. They claim they went to extraordinary lengths to avoid\n\ncivilian casualties, combing the area on foot in the riskiest style of urban\n\nwarfare.\n\n''We had no choice but to go after\n\nthe terrorists (who hid, armed and carrying explosives, amid a civilian population,''\n\nwrote Maariv editor Amnon Dankner in a front-page editorial. ''We did not erase\n\nthe camp with aerial bombardment but fought house-to-house, alley-to-alley...\n\nWe lost many soldiers because we were human and moral and tried to spare innocents.''\n\nThere was particular dismay with\n\nU.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen, who this week denounced the destruction wrought\n\nby Israel, saying it was unwarranted by any military objective and created a\n\nhuman catastrophe ''horrifying beyond belief.''\n\nHis remarks so outraged Israelis\n\nthat officials were considering cutting him off from access to the top political\n\nleadership, Israel Radio reported Saturday. Israelis complained that the U.N.\n\nenvoy was never so outspoken after a Palestinian suicide bombing.\n\n''It seems that at no time since\n\nthe establishment of the state has the gap between what Israelis think about\n\nthemselves and what the world says about them been so wide. And there is no\n\nplace in which that gap is more evident than in the Jenin refugee camp,'' wrote\n\ncommentator Nahum Barnea in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper.\n\n''I am not accusing anyone of massacres,''\n\nRoed-Larsen said Friday, a day after touring the camp. ''But what I saw yesterday\n\nwas truly appalling, the destruction was massive and the stench overwhelming.\n\n... We saw children looking for their parents. We saw fathers, brothers, sisters\n\ndigging in the rubble in order to find the corpses of their dear ones.''\n\nIsraeli Cabinet Minister Dan Meridor\n\nsaid Israel must prepare its case for the U.N. fact-finding team, making available\n\nthe officers and soldiers who fought in Jenin. ''We have nothing to hide, nothing\n\nto fear,'' he said Saturday.\n\n''We fought a tough battle,'' said\n\nMeridor. ''We lost 23 fighters. We can assume civilians were hurt, to our regret,\n\nbut it wasn't us who wanted to conduct the battle in this place.''\n\nMeridor said more than 20 of the\n\n50-odd suicide bombers who attacked civilians in Israel over the last year came\n\nfrom the Jenin area.\n\nRon Ben-Yishai, a veteran Israeli\n\nmilitary correspondent, said that by accusing Israel of a massacre the Palestinians\n\nwere playing a double game.\n\n''On one hand, they are saying 'we\n\nare martyrs, this is our Stalingrad. We fought to death, and this is evidence\n\nof Palestinian heroism.' On the other hand, they say this is a massacre,'' Ben-Yishai\n\nsaid in an interview.\n\n''Jenin was not a massacre. They\n\nchose to fight to the death, and they did. You can respect them,'' he said.\n\nYossi Sarid, a left-wing member\n\nof parliament, said he warned the government before the operation to expect\n\na high civilian toll. Israel Radio quoted Sarid as saying such a large armed\n\nforce operating in such a highly concentrated civilian location must figure\n\non causing heavy casualties.\n\nResidents have said that the worst\n\nof the Israeli onslaught came after 13 Israeli soldiers were killed on April\n\n9 in an elaborate ambush in a booby-trapped building -- the deadliest single\n\nincident in years for Israel's army.\n\nSoldiers say concealed booby traps\n\nwere everywhere -- on cars, refrigerators, doorways, next to sewers, even in\n\nwomen's purses. A massive D9 bulldozer cleared a path for armored personnel\n\ncarriers and tanks, and swept away bomb-laden buildings. The operation left\n\nan area the size of two football fields a flattened sea of debris.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Yoni Wolf, who\n\nfought throughout the battle, said the bulldozer was called in ''only after\n\nwe saw that a house was occupied by terrorists or was in the way to getting\n\nto an important position.''\n\nHe said ''at least twice a day,\n\nthere was ceasefire from our side, public announcements calling out to the terrorists\n\nto surrender. Many did. Even after we began, we would stop and see who was coming\n\nout. Only after that, the bulldozers would destroy the house.''\n\nSome Palestinians acknowledge they\n\nfled after hearing the warnings. Others who stayed and survived said they heard\n\nnothing, and accuse the Israelis of mindless and unnecessary destruction of\n\nproperty.\n\nMahmoud Fayed, 70, said that on\n\nthe third day of fighting he tried to stop the approaching bulldozer because\n\nhis wheelchair-bound son was trapped inside the house, and begged for a few\n\nminutes to bring him out. The driver ''stopped and listened to us, and then\n\ntold us to get out of the way,'' Fayed said Saturday, as he searched for his\n\nson's remains under the collapsed building.\n\nIsraelis also say that if the army\n\nhad committed atrocities on the scale the Palestinians claim, cries of protest\n\nwould have been clearly heard from the some soldiers who took part in the battle\n\n-- most of them reservists."
