        "text": "Lot 48\n\nDan Ben-Amotz\n\nOpening: $100\n\nSold for: $138\n\nIncluding buyer's premium\n\nBen-Amotz was a colorful, charismatic, fascinating and original person. Ben-Amotz was a brave and direct writer, sometimes harsh and expressed his thoughts and ideas even when they were very unusual. He intelligently shattered conventions and myths, freed the Hebrew language of its heavy formality and adopted street-language as a legitimate one. Ben-Amotz contributed to Israeli humor and was a political and social activist whose ideas were far from falling into conventional ideas. He supported marginal movements such as the Black Panthers. Ben-Amotz was also a collector of Israeli memorabilia and used to collect in streets and markets various objects during a period when no one attributed any value to them.\n\nWhen Dan Ben-Amotz was diagnosed with cancer and realized that his death was approaching, he organized a farewell party to all of his friends. All the who's who of the culture and entertainment circles attended the party, sang, held speeches and said good bye. This party, as many felt, was a farewell party not only for Dan Ben-Amotz but for a generation of creators, entertainers, writers and public figures and an important and fascinating chapter in the history of Israel coming to its end.\n\nIf details in the biography of Dan Ben-Amotz written by Amnon Dankner are accurate, then Dan Ben-Amotz had some violent, cruel and disgusting elements in his personality. But even if this is true, and in spite of the fact that during the years some of his ideas and writings lost their charm, Dan Ben-Amotz is still one of the most influential characters in the cultural and entertainment scenes in Israel.\n\n7 photos of the 1970s. Ben-Amotz with Shaike Ophir, barefoot in an exhibition, with Benny Amdursky, with Georges Mustaki. A photo from the film Matzor, etc."
