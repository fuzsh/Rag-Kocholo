        "text": "They lived well, the Israelis of the pre-Six Day War period.\n\nIsrael of 1965-7, after twenty years of phenomenal economic growth plus one year of recession, was a developed western economy, with a gross national product per capita of almost $8,500 (in today's U.S. Dollars), almost half of the American per capita GNP. This is an impressive achievement: the standard of living in Israel was then higher by far than that of most other countries, and higher than any measure of the standard of living of the nations of the Middle East and Eastern Europe - from where came millions of new immigrants to Israel in the 1950's and '60's.\n\nIn Tel Aviv was built the first skyscraper, the Shalom Tower; in Haifa there operated the first underground subway, the Carmelit. The tower and the subway signaled the first signs of future municipal transport development - above and below ground, like in the cities of America. In Jerusalem, the new Knesset [Israeli Parliament] building was inaugurated, in Eilat new hotels, in Ashdod new port docks. The national highway was completed, the pipe delivering clean water from the Kineret [Sea of Galilee] to the south - the second-largest national project after [the nuclear facility in] Dimona. Dimona of atomic power then was also Dimona of textile: before the Chinese took this over in the 1990's, Israel's governments declared the domestic textile and clothing industry as the engine of growth and source of employment for the masses in the 1960's.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the recession towards the end of 1965, all the Israelis worked: unemployment fell below 4% of the workforce. A rising insufficiency in working hands was felt, and the level of real wages rose without end.\n\nThe Israelis of 1967, writes Tom Segev in his book '1967', \"Saw themselves as part of the western world and so built expectations of for the outlook of their lives and of the nation... they felt secure, believed that their livelihood was becoming better and so too would be the future of their children. In the middle of the 1960's it indeed appeared that Israel was leaping forward from feat to feat, in almost every field in the real of everyday life: in every city of the country there were movements of development and growth spurring greater hope and pride.\"\n\nThe Contessa competed against models of Israeli-made cars: the inexpensive \"Susita\" [the name is a play on the word \"Sus\" for horse, or horse-power - probably borrowed from the French-Citroen \"Deux Chevaux\"], the white-collar/army-used \"Carmel\", and the sporty \"Sabra\" [the name means \"cactus flower\" and is Israeli slang for a native-born Israeli] which was the splendor of local motor-engine technology. The public loved these inexpensive plastic cars, but the economists claimed forcefully that the Israeli car industry possessed no competitive advantages, that there was no marketing future and that it existed solely from the government subsidies which flowed into the pockets of the industrialists and hurt the consumers. Two ministers of finance, Levi Eshkol at first and then Pinchas Sapir afterwards, agreed with them; the Israeli car industry expired in a matter of years thereafter.\n\nThe first experimental television broadcasts began in 1966, and gathered the nation into the worldwide tribal campfire. In 1967 live broadcasts of the army parades were also broadcast, during which the Chief of Staff, Yitzhak Rabin, recounted to the Prime Minister [Levi] Eshkol on the inflow of the Egyptian Army into Sinai [i.e. in contravention to the UN cease fire agreement]. Thereupon began the period of waiting prior to the Six Day War.\n\nThe Hebrew University in Jerusalem was rated as one of the best in the world, and her school of economics was ranked the best from among those outside the United States. In an international study of mathematics aptitude, the students of Israel took first place.\n\nAll around, Israel was regarded as an industrialized country, although in international classifications she always appeared as \"developing\". There were many benefits in this as far as eligibility for foreign aid, although its extent was actually marginal: most of the Dollars which flowed into Israel in the 1960's came not from American Jews nor from American governments but rather from the exporters - the farmers, the diamond industry workers, the tourists and the Dead Sea industries. Also the Holocaust survivors: hundreds of millions of Deutsche Marks in war reparations (to individuals) and restitutions (to the State) from West Germany financed the economy's core, the import of \"luxury\" consumer goods and the large public investments in infrastructure. Some of the money was wasted on showcase programs and white elephants. The economic press attacked and the government replied in defense in a humbled voice of weakness.\n\n[Looking a decade back, at the 1950's, Howard Sachar in his book \"A History of Israel\" (page 426) puts the issue of foreign currency sources in sharper light: during \"Israel's first decade, only one-twelfth of the nation's foreign currency expenditures were paid through 'earned' income. The rest derived from American, German and other overseas sources. During the 1950's, world Jewry covered 59 percent of the balance-of-payments deficit, the United States government 12 percent, and West Germany 29 percent. Quite literally these funds sustained Israel's economy, gave the nation breathing room in the unprecidented task of tripling, feeding, housing, and employing its population and defending its borders.\"]\n\n= = =\n\nThey lived well in a State in which it was good to live, good for the wealthy but also good, relatively, for the poor. Israel of the 1960's was very much a country of equality, \"among the most equalized in the world\", writes Prof. Penny Ginor in the book \"Social and Economic Parities in Israel\". According to one international comparison, back then we were in first place in the western world in terms of economic equality, according to a different comparison, in fourth place after Sweden, Japan and England. Today, as is known, Israel closes the list of equalized countries at the tail's end. We fell from the heights of equality to the bottom.\n\nOnly about 8% of the citizens of Israel lived in those years under the poverty line. The low incidence of poverty placed Israel in line with countries with low poverty, like Britain, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand as a member which didn't suffer - relatively - from the problem of relative poverty. The poor of Israel received a larger segment of the national product than the poor of other developing countries.\n\nAnd today? About a quarter of the Israelis lived last year under the poverty line. This is the highest rate of poverty in the West. No other modern country or society has an incidence of poverty which approaches Israel's record levels. Within less than four decades we jumped from nearly last place to first place in the index of poverty.\n\nThe power of the Histadrut, against a backdrop of a weak private sector, worried even labor ministers, and they began to curtail her strides. [Levi] Eshkol, [Pinchas] Sapir, and Rabinovich (Minister of Finance from 1974-76) didn't want Israel's economy to be forcibly turned into an entity controlled by the apparachniks of the Histadrut. They saw in this scenario a great danger to the Zionist enterprise and an abominable lack of efficiency.\n\nIn the land of Israel, like elsewhere in the world, it turned out that it was not possible to run socialist enterprises for a long term in an economic environment of competitiveness. It further turned out that union bureaucracy was not immune to management mistakes and personal corruption.\n\nSince then the workers' economy has vanished completely: its factories either dismantled, or went bankrupt, or were privatized; Tnuva is supposed to be sold this year to a private investment firm. The Histadrut (including cooperatives and Kibbutzim) now employs 1-2% of the Israeli workforce. The government's share of the production sector also shrank, from a quarter 40 years ago to tenth and less now.\n\n= = =\n\nThe intervention of a high rate of growth, together with low economic parities and an enormous and aggressive non-private sector, which characterized Israel at the outbreak of the Six Day War, earned worldwide amazement. Books were written about the economic miracle of the Jewish State, the diligence of her workers, the education of her children, the dedication of her leaders and the momentum of development in investment in the State.\n\nThe miracle was interrupted in 1966: the Israeli government decided in that year to spill cold water on the burning economy. Prime Minister Eshkol and the Minister of Finance, Sapir, feared \"arrogant consumption\" from a shortage of foreign currency, a deep government deficit, from inflation which reared its head, and from what was characterized as a \"decline in work ethic\". The initiated economic slowdown was immediately granted an original Hebrew name, \"mitun\" (recession). The recession indeed succeeded beyond the expected: 100,000 workers were laid-off from work within a year and a half, unemployment jumped from 3.5% to 11.5%, the economy stopped with the screeching of breaks and a sense of frustration and anger prevailed over the public.\n\nA girl of 13 from Beit She'an, who was asked on a radio broadcast summing up 1966 if she was hungry and answered \"yes\", shook up the country and nearly toppled the Eshkol government. The ethnic tension returned to the headlines. The media painted a gloomy human landscape, despondent people. Israel almost stood on the edge of closure; that the last one to leave should not forget to turn off the lights, went a macabre joke. The number of emigrants, estimated the newspapers, was greater than the number of immigrants, and that the country was being emptied out of its inhabitants.\n\nMost of these things simply weren't correct: the girl from Beit She'an wasn't suffering from hunger, the scale of emigration from Israel didn't expand, the public didn't lose its faith in the State - even though it expressed doubts about her leadership - and Zionism didn't reach its end. Israel on the eve of the Six Day War was a strong welfare state. But the recession achieved three significant results. One was economic: the balance of payments improved, inflation declined, and the government deficit narrowed to zero. A second result was political: since that recession, no government in Israel ever dared to openly declare its intention to increase unemployment. The third result was historical: the reports on the deep crisis in Israel, on the Israeli society being tempestuous and on the verge of disintegration, which lost its will to live, convinced the Arabs that Israel is not willing to go to war. The broadcasters of \"Kol Ha'Raam\" (\"The Voice of Thunder\" - Egypt's anti-Israeli Hebrew language program) from Cairo and the voice of Moscow Radio mostly ridiculed the \"army of the unemployed of Moshe Dayan\" [the Defense Minister]."
