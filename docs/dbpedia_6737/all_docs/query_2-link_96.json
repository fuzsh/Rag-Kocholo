Both European and Israeli journalists can find numerous reasons to be critical of the other. We asked whether this criticism is justified, and to what extent, with hindsight it might have been moderated. To avoid generalities, the debate focused on the coverage of recent events, mainly the war in Lebanon and the Israeli operations in the Gaza strip of the autumn of 2006. The final session dealt with another issue on which European and Israeli perceptions often differ, namely the migration to Europe of people from Islamic countries.\n\nThe Public conference, \"After Hall\" with David Witzthum, Israel Television as a Moderator with:\n\nMiguel Angel Bastenier, El Pais, Spain\n\nChristiane Schloetzer, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Germany\n\nJurek Kuczkiewicz, Le Soir, Belgium\n\nDavid Horvitz, Editor in Chief, Jerusalem Post\n\nDavid Landau, Editor, Haaretz\n\nShalom Keital, Channel 2 News\n\nMonday\n\n12 June 2006\n\nThe Malka Brender\n\nHall of Justice,\n\nTrubowicz Building,\n\nthe Buchmann\n\nFaculty of Law,\n\nTel Aviv University\n\nEntrance through\n\nRamniceanu\n\nGate (4)\n\nThe Institute\n\nfor Diplomacy\n\nand Regional Cooperation\n\nCommunication\n\nDiplomacy and the Media: who leads whom?\n\n9:00 - 9:30 Gathering and refreshments\n\n9:30 - 9:45 Welcoming and Opening Remark\n\nProf. Moshe Semyonov, Head, The Institute for Diplomacy and regional cooperation\n\nDr. Ron Pundak, Executive Director, The Peres Center for Peace\n\nProf. Raanan Rein, Vice-Rector, Tel Aviv University\n\n09:45  11:30\n\nThe Interaction between Diplomacy and the Media - Theoretical Aspects\n\nChair: Prof. Shimon Shamir, former Ambassador of Israel in Egypt and Jordan\n\nProf. Yoram Peri, Head of the Herzog Institute for Media, Politics and Society\n\nProf. Galia Golan, School of Government, Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya\n\nDr. Alon Liel, former Executive Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nMr. Reuven Merhav, former Executive Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\n11:30 - 12:30 Keynote Speaker\n\nTough Times: National Security and the American Media\n\nMs. Judith Miller, Journalist and Writer\n\n12:30  14:00: Lunch Break\n\n14:00  16:00\n\nIsrael and the Middle East - a Case Study\n\nChair: Prof. Zeev Segal, Department of Public Policy, Tel Aviv University\n\nProf. Gabriel Wiemann, Department of Communication, Haifa University\n\nMs. Ayala Hasson, Channel 1 News\n\nMr. Ehud Yaari, Channel 2 News\n\nMr. Eitan Haber, former Chief of Staff, Prime Minister's Office\n\nLive broadcast of the event\n\nMonday 12 June 2006\n\nWednesday-Thursday\n\n8  9 June 2005\n\nThe Malka Brender\n\nHall of Justice,\n\nTrubowicz Building,\n\nthe Buchmann\n\nFaculty of Law,\n\nTel Aviv University\n\nEntrance through\n\nRamniceanu\n\nGate (4)\n\nDepartment of\n\nCommunication\n\nThe S.
