        "text": "It is the Jewish new year. So first of all: Shana Tova to you ALL!\n\nThese days, Jews are invited to celebrate all new beginnings. It is also a time for reflection and of a retrospective regard upon the time that has elapsed.\n\nThis issue of Calcalis is dedicated for people in the middle of their life.\n\nG Magazine\n\nG magazine has embarked on the issue of the state of affairs in the Israeli day care scene. Since there is no supervision on these privately owned establishments: anything goes.\n\nAnother G magazine feature had dealt with the phenomenon of career women, who are struggling to negotiate their working hours, in order to maintain their jobs, with their role as mothers and housewives.\n\nThe new column written by Bibliky, is a refreshing source of inspiration for me. This week he wrote about the story behind the legendary record label Atlantic, and it’s legendary founders: Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun, who together brought mascots such as Ray Charles into our collective consciousness.\n\nLapid\n\nThis time, Lapid took the opportunity to recommend two books and a record for which he particularly liked:\n\nThe record by Yahli Sobol and Rea Mochiach:‘Eldorado’\n\nA book By Amnon Dankner: Uncle Eva’s nights and days\n\nYonatan Geffen’s: and Yotam Givol Cook book :’Personal chef’\n\nYet another Lapid\n\nTwo weeks ago, Yair celebrated, both his grandfather’s centenary and his son’s Bar Mitzva\n\nSilence\n\nWas the title of Lapid’s piece which evolved around a momentary wish to be found in the midst of the absolutely peaceful New-Zelandic paradise. A symptom which can serve a proof of sanity for any Israeli living in Israel on every given day.\n\nLogic tells us we’re Simpsons not Spocks\n\n“…Imagine – I realise this sounds like some bizarre joke – how Mr Spock, Odysseus and Homer Simpson would go about applying for membership of a gym. Spock would choose a suitable contract – a costly payment per visit, or an annual flat-fee for unlimited visits – after correctly forecasting his gym usage. Simpson, wrongly expecting that he would use the gym a lot, would sign up for the expensive annual membership. Odysseus might also choose the annual membership, but for a different reason: he would hope that the “all-the-iron-you-can-pump” contract might provoke him to exercise, despite the foreseeable temptation to stay in bed.”\n\nTim Harford, August 30 2008\n\nThis illustration accompanied Harford’s advice for a wood-be groom regarding his possible choice of a high-flying career woman for a wife\n\nHouses cost more in the summer. Here’s why\n\n“…If house prices systematically surge in summer and stagnate in winter – and they do, in Belgium, France, the US and especially the UK – then why do so many people buy in summer? Why don’t we make more of an effort to buy earlier, or to wait for a few months until the market cools again?”\n\nTim Harford, September 6 2008\n\nAnd this one accompanied Harford’s reply to a father who sought advice for his incentive scheme he devised for his 18 years old student sun.\n\nWhy it’s dangerous to be a witch in a recession\n\n“Why did people murder suspected witches in renaissance\n\nEurope? And why do they still do so today in sub-Saharan Africa? As\n\nsomeone whose main source of information about witch trials is Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I was fascinated to learn that witch-burning has its own grim economics.”\n\nTim Harford, September 13 2008\n\n“Dear Economist: Should I move from Florence to the UK just for a job?” Was the question Harford was asked to help finding an answer to this week. attached is my reply:"
