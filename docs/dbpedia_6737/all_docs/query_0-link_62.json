AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS A case study of a radical journalistic experiment Hagar Lahav and Zvi Reich This study analyzes a journalistic community’s interpretation of an experiment in which authors (primarily fiction writers) and poets replaced the reporters of a major Israeli newspaper and produced the news in two special issues. Using a mix of methodologies*content analysis, interviews with journalists and authors, a survey among journalists and analysis of readers’ responses*the study shows that the journalistic community reacted conservatively to this exceptional project and framed it as a ‘‘deviation’’ to be rejected as ‘‘not real journalism.’’ This may suggest that the journalistic communities’ reflexive protection of their familiar routines is so strong that it may endanger their ability to survive unfolding threats. KEYWORDS breaches of journalism; future of journalism; innovation in news; interpretive communities; Israel; newspapers Introduction On Wednesday, June 10, 2009, the Israeli elite daily newspaper Haaretz published a special issue called Haaretz of the Authors. The entire news section was written that day by authors and poets, who replaced the newspaper’s reporters in covering the news. The World Editors Forum website stated that ‘‘the journalism rule book was literally thrown out of the window’’ (Kishtwari, 2009). The Forward weekly noted: ‘‘This was a near complete replacement of the newspaper itself’’ (Estrin, 2009). The New Yorker called the project an ‘‘unexpected delight’’ (Kaiser, 2009). The Israeli media cheered, all the copies were sold out and Haaretz editors broke out the champagne. This exceptional event, that differs so radically from ordinary journalism, represents what Reese (1997) calls a ‘‘paradigmatic anomaly’’*a troubling situation that does not fit comfortably into journalistic routines, yet cannot be presented easily as something that falls outside of what is commonly called journalism. Anomalies present a unique opportunity for a cultural analysis of journalism, as they question the logic of journalism and its work routines through their violation (Zelizer, 2004, p. 175). They often evoke discussion within the professional interpretive community (Zelizer, 1993), that negotiates and articulates key professional questions, such as what is journalism, who is a journalist and what are the current and future states of journalism. Journalistic interpretative communities’ discussions of professional identity and its acceptable boundaries are becoming particularly relevant under the current transforma- tive condition of journalism and the experimental atmosphere it evokes (Ryfe, 2009). Literature about changes in journalism, however, tends to be characterized by technological bias (Boczkowski, 2004; Deuze, 2004, 2005; Domingo and Heinonen, 2008; Journalism Studies, 2011, iFirst Article, 118 ISSN 1461-670X print/1469-9699 online – 2011 Taylor Francis DOI: 10.1080/1461670X.2011.562659 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n3. Lowrey, 2006; Lowrey and Mackay, 2008; Singer, 2003, 2004) in which new technologies are used as the chief*if not the only*variable to explain changes and threats, thereby systematically overlooking professional, organizational and cultural issues that merit observation. The Haaretz project, published in two successive years (2009 and 2010), provided a rare opportunity for overcoming the tyranny of technocentrism. As the project is not directly connected to new technology, yet is obviously a non-traditional form of newsmaking and part of a broader trend, it enabled us to study changes in journalism while remaining free of technological bias. The project also provided an exceptional research opportunity for study of the interpretation of a journalistic novelty in the heart of the field rather than at its ‘‘alternative,’’ experimental edges. It is not often that a mainstream newspaper initiates such a radical deviation from ordinary newswork (Ryfe, 2009) or a journalistic community is goaded to conduct such a reflexive discussion about its routines and values (Zelizer, 1993, 2004), as journalists only rarely articulate their practices (Cook, 1998, p. 89; Schultz, 2007). We perceived the unique and dramatic nature of the Haaretz project as a semi- experimental situation (Berelson, 1949, p. 112) that demands very quick response in an attempt to capitalize on the fresh recall of the parties involved. In ‘‘firehouse research’’ style (Katz and Dayan, 2003, p. 122), data gathering began within 24 hours after the first publication. Under such circumstances, we did not have the time to formulate a theoretical approach before rushing to record empirical data. The theoretical frame presented here is thus a later insight. To record the parties’ interpretation of the project, various data-gathering methods were applied, including interviews with editors and authors, a survey of journalists and collecting comments about the project in the media and in readers’ responses. The data analysis reveals the conservative and narrowing interpretation that dominated discourse surrounding the project and charts the discursive tools that entrenched this conservatism. Theoretical Frame: The Changing Faces of Journalism Recent scholarly literature is dominated by a transformative spirit, epitomized in works such as The Changing Faces of Journalism (Zelizer, 2009) and in the series of conferences and special issues bearing the slogan ‘‘The Future of Journalism.’’ Papers and books typically open with the premise that journalism is changing (Domingo et al., 2008; Singer et al., forthcoming) and even undergoing ‘‘an epochal transformation’’ (Schudson, 2009, p. 369). There seems to be agreement that the journalistic model of ‘‘a trained professional delivering objectively validated content [or an opinion by an authoritative public voice] to a reader (or viewer, or listener)’’ (McNair, 2009, p. 347), that dominated elective democracies in the twentieth century, is breaking down. The discourse of change is typically characterized by a pessimistic attitude. The news industry’s future appears uncertain and its environment replete with pressures, under- scoring what Gans (2003, p. 40) called an atmosphere of ‘‘declinism’’ and threatening ‘‘the very survival of the best of the ‘mainstream media’’’ (Schudson 2009, p. 370). The changes, it is claimed, threaten journalists’ ability to maintain high professional standards (Deuze, 2008; Örnebring, 2009; Zelizer, 2009) and evoke trends such as marketing or entertainment 2 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n4. orientation (tabloidization), cynicism, professional biases and the like (Bennett, 2003; Cappella and Jamieson, 1997; McLachlan and Golding, 2000; McManus, 1994). The discourse of change in journalism is dominated by a technological view that attributes the transformation to changes in the technological environment, focusing on digital technology and the World Wide Web in particular. Two major arguments characterize this view: the first focuses on incorporation of new technologies in news organizations, emphasizing newsroom convergence and multimedia journalism. It points to the changes that the convergence process evokes in journalistic routines and rituals, organization’s division of labor, formats for presentation and storytelling techniques (Boczkowski, 2004; Deuze, 2004, 2005; Singer, 2004). The second argument considers the outcomes of the entrance of new players into the journalistic field. As more news is gathered and distributed today by amateurs armed with cellphone, cameras and Internet access, participatory journalism, citizen journalists, bloggers, ‘‘I-reporting’’ and so on blur the line between news producer and news audience (Domingo and Heinonen, 2008; Lowrey, 2006; Lowrey and Anderson, 2005; Lowrey and Mackay, 2008; Singer, 2003). Taking the two arguments together, it has been suggested that ‘‘the profession of journalism has been superseded by technology’’ (Nossek, 2009, p. 358). Technology blurs the boundaries of the profession (Lowrey, 2006), changes professional practices and values (Matheson, 2004), threatens journalists’ symbolic capital and hegemony as gatekeepers (Lowrey and Anderson, 2005), reduces journalists’ autonomy (Deuze, 2004) and undermines job security. This technocentrism, that looks for the transformational coin only under the technological lamppost, offers a one-dimensional and partial concept of changes in journalism and ignores complementary sources of the transformative inclination. From a sociological point of view, for example, one may point to the fragmentation of audiences due to globalization, migration and increasing cultural diversity (Deuze, 2005), as well as to the changing lifestyle of individuals (Preston, 2008) as change-motivating forces. Culturally speaking, the postmodern Zeitgeist, with its fascination over spectacles, celebrities and entertainment, as well as its preference for the ‘‘subjective’’ over the ‘‘objective,’’ has also contributed to the changing nature of the field (Bird, 2009; van Zoonen, 2005). Economic trends, such as the decreasing value of information in a world overwhelmed by multiplying knowledge and global corporation ownership, compel journalism to seek new business models (Picard, 2008). Technocentrism may also conflate the future of journalism with the future of a particular technological platform, primarily the press (McNair, 2009). Thus, the differences between the crisis in journalism and that of the printed press are becoming blurred. There is no doubt that newspapers are facing grave challenges as they face collapsing revenues, declining circulations and the emergence of free newspapers. Clearly, the traditional papers need to adopt survival strategies and to urgently and dramatically adapt both their contents and formats in response to such pressures (Franklin, 2008). The exact relations between the changes in journalism and the changes in newspapers, however, remain to be clarified. Technocentrism may also obscure the observation that technological capacity is not a sufficient condition for a transformation and that journalists’ attitude towards change is a crucial component in the transformative process. Several studies demonstrated that adoption of new work practices or innovative routines is far from automatic or easy (Filak, 2003; Hansen et al., 1998; Klinenberg, 2005, p. 53; Ryfe, 2006). Innovations and broken AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 3 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n5. routines, whether directly connected to new technologies or not, are negotiated by the professional interpretive community (Zelizer, 1993) to determine their meaning vis-à-vis professional identity and its boundaries. In this case as well, technocentrism may cause us to forget that the breaks in routine that challenge journalism’s boundaries are not always the outcome of technological developments. ‘‘Breaches of journalism’’ (Zelizer, 2004, p. 196) also include, for example, cases in which individual journalists (such as Jayson Blair and Janet Cooke) violate codes of appropriate professional behavior by fabricating stories, inventing quotations and so forth (Eason, 1986; Fakazis, 2006; Lasorsa and Dai, 2007; Reese, 1997). ‘‘Cases where news events and their coverage are different in shape or function’’ from everyday journalism (Zelizer, 2004, p. 197), such as coverage of non-scheduled major events (Bennett et al., 2007; Berkowitz, 1992; Zelizer and Allan, 2002) and media events (Dayan and Katz, 1992), may also constitute breaches of journalism. Furthermore, introduction of ‘‘alternative,’’ non- traditional genres may test journalism’s boundaries, as it creates ‘‘generic and discursive instability’’ (McNair, 2009, p. 347). In such cases, current studies tend to emphasize Citizen Journalism (Atton, 2002, 2003; Harcup, 2005; Reich, 2008), although long before it came about, in the 1950s and 1960s, New, Literary Journalism had destabilized journalism’s epistemology, methods and presentation style (Aucoin, 2001; Boynton, 2005; Harstock, 1999). Finally, news organizations’ solicitation of outsiders*often household names such as Kevin Spacey, Bono or Stephen Colbert, for example*to access the core of their activity as guest editors, also contributes to the professional identity challenges facing journalism. When professional interpretive communities negotiate the meaning of such cases, they place each of them along a definition axis, extending from unacceptable deviation from journalism that is to be rejected to acceptable digression from everyday routine. Such negotiation is crucial, as the boundaries surrounding journalism are relatively ‘‘unin- sulated’’ (Schudson, 1978) and their definition relies ‘‘on ill-defined procedures and techniques as the sort of mystical heart of the practice, a heart that, to keep beating, must remain protected’’ (Van Maanen and Barley, 1985, cited in Lowrey and Anderson, 2005). Interpretation as deviation protects the existing ‘‘boundaries of permissible journalism’’ (Eason, 1986, p. 430) by narrowing what is considered to be ‘‘journalism.’’ Perception as digression, on the other hand, expands journalism, allowing inclusion and integration of non-conventional cases into routine. This process becomes essential during periods of change. On the one hand, too much flexibility is dangerous when the struggle over symbolic power at journalism’s borders (Dooley, 1999) is intensifying and the ‘‘existing boundaries*between professional and amateur, between platforms, between sub-genres of journalism, between the journalisms of information and entertainment’’ are already dissipating and will continue to erode (McNair, 2009, p. 349). On the other hand, as the newspapers*and perhaps journalism itself*have to reinvent themselves, to ‘‘adapt or die’’ (Smolkin, 2006), flexibility in adopting new practices may be vital for their survival. Herein lies the dilemma: an interpretation that is too conservative means death, while one that is too liberal entails the risk of losing legitimacy. The case of Haaretz of the Authors gave us a unique opportunity to examine these issues further. As our study will show, the project’s initiators clearly ascribe it to the transformative spirit that characterizes both current journalism and current newspapers. The project, however, is not directly connected to any new technology and was produced and distributed in a ‘‘good old newspaper’’ (and its website) using ‘‘good old technology.’’ 4 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n6. Thus, the case study enables us to look at changes in journalism without falling prey to the snare of technocentrism. At the same time, Haaretz of the Authors challenged many of the profession’s boundaries*between professional and non-professional newspeople, be- tween genres and storytelling techniques, and between information and (highbrow) entertainment. Its innovative character evoked a wide and vivid discussion within the journalistic interpretive community, thereby enabling us to study that community’s perception of professional limits and its willingness (or unwillingness) to expand the boundaries of acceptable journalism in the face of present challenges. The Study The Haaretz Project Haaretz of the Authors is a special project, published in honor of Hebrew Book Week (an annual national event) in which authors replace the newspaper’s reporters in writing the news section. The project’s role model is the French daily Libération, that has published five such issues since 1997, but as Israeli exposure to French newspapers is very limited, when first published, on June 10, 2009, the Haaretz project was received as a complete innovation. It was then published again on June 2, 2010. The layout in the two issues was rather similar to the newspaper’s regular design and at first glance they looked like ordinary weekday editions. A closer look, however, revealed very different content. In 2009, for example, the stock market summary, by author Avri Herling, was: ‘‘Everything’s okay. Everything’s as usual. Yesterday trading en- ded . . . The economists went home . . . Dow Jones closed with 8,761 points . . . In the shop prices were raised again.’’ The weather report was a poem entitled ‘‘Summer Sonnet’’ (‘‘Summer is the least sharp pencil/in the seasons’ pencil case’’). News assignments included coverage of a White House press conference, interviews with political figures, spending a night at a drug rehabilitation center for young people, and a trip to Akaba, Jordan. The issues also included opinion and analysis pieces, written by such household names as Umberto Eco, Margaret Atwood, Amos Oz and Jonathan Safran Foer. Although some items preserved conventional journalism style more than others, all diverged from traditional news reporting and presented personal and intuitive voices. Haaretz, an elite Hebrew-language daily newspaper, is often described as ‘‘Israel’s version of The New York Times.’’ This private-owned broadsheet, with a weekday readership of some 75,000, has the fourth largest circulation among Israel’s dailies. Haaretz promotes traditional quality journalism and enjoys high prestige (Caspi and Limor, 1992). It has a long history of promoting literature (Neiger, 2000). The newspaper has been facing severe financial problems recently. Over the past two years, the newspaper underwent some radical personnel changes. All senior editors, including the editor- in-chief, were replaced and many journalists were laid off (Prisko, 2008). Methodology We perceived the time period immediately following the first publication of the project (2009) as a ‘‘shock period,’’ a time when a central component of journalistic routines suddenly changes dramatically (Berelson, 1949, p. 112). Shock periods are optimal AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 5 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n7. times for the study of media production because they offer a ‘‘quasi-experimental’’ environment to be studied and render participants more aware of their professional ideas. Research for this study, which sought to take advantage of the quasi-experimental situation, was arranged within a very short time (Reich, 2008). Data collection began 24 hours after publication and was completed within one month. To benefit from interpretations accumulated over time (Zelizer, 1993), we resumed data collection after the second publication (2010). In both cases, we applied a mix of the following data- gathering methods: 1. In-depth interviews with Haaretz editors in charge of the special issue. In 2009 we conducted face-to-face interviews with Haaretz editor-in-chief Dov Alfon, the project’s executive editor Shai Golden and the project’s two producers. In 2010, we interviewed the project’s executive editor and the producer. Our questions focused on interviewees’ insights regarding the project and their perceptions of the state of Haaretz and of print journalism. 2. Structured interviews with a sample of authors. An additional point of view was obtained in telephone interviews of about 30 minutes’ duration with 22 of the 33 authors who participated in the 2009 issue.1 For this study, we focused on interviews with 12 authors who had worked previously as professional journalists, as they may also be perceived as members of the journalistic interpretive community. 3. Online survey among Haaretz journalists. An anonymous electronic questionnaire, including both closed and open questions, was distributed among the Haaretz staff (comprising just under 300 people). Following 180 reminder telephone calls to increase the response rate, 63 journalists filled out the questionnaire*a response rate of more than 20 percent. 4. External references to the project in the media. To study the reaction of the professional interpretive community outside Haaretz, we collected comments published in other media outlets, in Israel and elsewhere. In 2009, we found 54 references: seven on Israeli radio and TV, 24 at Israeli online news sites and blogs, and 23 at foreign online sites. Items varied from short, factual previews to long and extensive discussions about the project and its significance. In 2010 we found only five brief, informative references. These quantitative findings will be addressed below. 5. Readers’ responses. We collected published letters to the editor, readers’ responses to the authors’ items and non-published letters and e-mails sent personally to the editor-in-chief and submitted to us on request. These readers’ responses proved to be very poor, however, consisting mostly of brief and banal reactions. 6. Semi-structured interview with the literary editor of Libération. To extend beyond the Israeli experience, we conducted a face-to-face interview with Claire Devarrieux, the literary editor of the French daily Libération, who served as the editor-in-chief for four special authors’ issues. Taken together, this mix of methods supplied us with extensive project interpreta- tion data, presenting perspectives from different positions within the interpretive community (journalists, audience and journalism critics). Interpreting the Haaretz Project The interpretive community discussed the project and its significance avidly on publication of the first issue (2009) but nearly ignored the second one (2010). Analysis of 6 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n8. 2009 reactions reveals several discursive tools used to frame the project. All material and quotes presented in the analysis are from 2009 unless stated otherwise. ‘‘That’s Great, but . . .’’ When first published, an overwhelming majority of readers, journalism critics and Haaretz journalists described the project in superlatives such as ‘‘refreshing,’’ ‘‘creative,’’ ‘‘exciting,’’ ‘‘brilliant,’’ ‘‘surprising,’’ ‘‘moving,’’ and even ‘‘genius.’’ Although some respondents offered criticism of particular items or author performance, the community appeared almost united in its highly positive response to the project. The special issue was found ‘‘more interesting’’ than a regular issue by 86 percent of Haaretz journalists who responded to the survey (N63); 73 percent graded the project ‘‘excellent’’ or ‘‘very good.’’ ‘‘I kept the issue as a souvenir,’’ wrote one, while another added, ‘‘it’s the first time that I read the entire newspaper.’’ Editors in charge of the special issue described euphoric feelings and a celebration in the newsroom. One spoke enthusiastically about ‘‘a once in a lifetime experience.’’ Another wrote in his weekly column, ‘‘I was part of something big’’ (Golden, 2009). Authors expressed their wish to be invited again. There were no negative readers’ responses. Some respondents also addressed the commercial aspect, calling the project a brilliant public relations move. Only one of the 31 references published in Israeli media expressed an entirely negative evaluation of the project. The blogger wrote: ‘‘What were they thinking? . . . Was there no one to explain that such promotion is infantile? Can anyone estimate the damage to the newspaper’s credibility?’’ (Gotlib, 2009). Negative or ambivalent reactions towards the project were also found in the survey in statements such as ‘‘news by authors is mortification of the newspaper’’ and ‘‘the project is a disgrace; it manifests lack of respect for the journalistic profession.’’ Beneath the surface of positive or negative evaluations, the questions at the heart of the discourse were: What, if any, should the journalistic field learn from the project? Does it bear a message concerning journalism*and if so, what is this message? Positive answers to these questions*i.e. claims that the project is meaningful to journalism*were found mostly within Haaretz. They appeared in interviews with editors and in 65 percent of questionnaire responses. The project was perceived as an experiment in journalism by 47 percent of survey participants.2 One project editor said: ‘‘The basic question that journalism faces today is whether it can reinvent itself, not only through its language but through its producers . . . The project is an experiment in which we replaced our main production factor.’’ Those who considered the project an experiment in journalism were divided in their attitude regarding its significance into positiveneutral and pessimisticnegative attitudes. Representing the positiveneutral attitude, a reporter described the project as an ‘‘exercise in philosophy of journalism: Who is a journalist when any user comment writer is a reporter? . . . What is the role of a daily newspaper that recycles chronicled information? And very good news at the practical level: It is possible to produce good newspapers in Israel.’’ Claiming that the project should be a practical lesson in good journalism, one editor wrote: ‘‘I hope that reporters did some soul searching while reading: ‘How do I write? Was I original? As a reader, would I like to read my own reports?’ If such soul searching was accomplished, [the project] is worthwhile.’’ AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 7 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n9. Negative attitudes, in turn, framed the experiment as dangerous. One reporter wrote that the project bears a ‘‘problematic message . . . as if the ‘ordinary’ newspaper were not really justified.’’ An editor wrote: ‘‘This is an insult to journalists: ‘You are not needed, you can be easily replaced, we wish you were more talented.’ There is something very dangerous in its message.’’ Considering this danger, it is not surprising that there was yet another frame that rejected the project as a source of journalistic knowledge all together. One reporter stated bluntly: ‘‘What can we learn from it about journalism? Nothing! There is no connection between this one-time gala issue and journalism.’’ What is surprising is the overwhelming dominance of this frame, mostly outside Haaretz but also in about 30 percent of responses, even among the project’s leading editors. Even the editor-in-chief was quick when interviewed to point out the literary lessons of the project but said that he still has to think about the journalistic lesson. ‘‘This is Not Real Journalism’’ The professional community almost unanimously rejected the idea that the project is an experiment that bears a lesson for journalists and/or newspapers. The main discursive mechanism that served to frame the project as ‘‘something brilliant that has (almost) nothing to teach us about journalism’’ was its definition as ‘‘not journalism.’’ Even the project’s initiators appear to have adopted this interpretation. One leading editor said: ‘‘It was not a journalistic work. It looks like it, because of the power of a ninety-year-old format . . . Anything can pretend to be news, if the editor is talented.’’ The idea of ‘‘camouflage’’ and ‘‘pretending’’ was also expressed by the notion of role games. Journalism critic and former Haaretz editor-in-chief Hanoch Marmari (2009) wrote: Role-changing games are as old as school days, when the student council takes over the teacher’s place for one day . . . [The project’s] swap emphasizes the large general similarity and the narrow*but unbridgeable*difference between these two types of keyboard crafts persons. A correlated perspective was offered by an editor involved in the project, who emphasized that the authors were ‘‘playing at being journalists,’’ ‘‘masquerading as journalists,’’ and ‘‘playing the journalistic game.’’ This same point, from the opposite direction, was also emphasized by Libération’s literary editor, who said that the authors ‘‘are not playing at journalism; they are authors.’’ The notions of ‘‘playing’’ and ‘‘games’’ have a deep cultural connection with the violation of ‘‘real life,’’ ‘‘work’’ and ‘‘routine.’’ Play is characterized by its restriction to place and time defined by their deviation from everyday life (Huizinga, 2003 [1949]). It is also deeply associated with ‘‘pretending’’ and ‘‘illusion’’ (as opposed to ‘‘reality’’). Introduction of these notions into the discourse framed the project as not being part of ‘‘real journalism in real life’’ because journalism, we are told, is not a game. A journalist is not expected to act ‘‘as if’’ s/he is a journalist, but to be a journalist. Indeed, ‘‘pretending’’ appears to contradict the traditional understanding of journalism as a true account of true reality and is consequently framed as ‘‘deviation from journalism,’’ as shown in ‘‘journalistic scandals’’ such as the Jayson Blair and Janet Cooke cases (Eason, 1986; Fakazis, 2006; Zelizer, 2004). The notion of play is also associated with ‘‘fun’’ (versus ‘‘seriousness’’). In the discourse, ‘‘real journalism’’ was understood to be ‘‘serious.’’ However, in contrast to the conventional lamentations over the dominance of ‘‘fun’’ and entertainment in today’s 8 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n10. tabloidization process (Patterson, 2000; van Zoonen, 2005; Zelizer, 2009), one blogger wrote that the project demonstrates that ‘‘not everything is as serious as the newspapers want us to think and as we would like to think. It is OK to have fun’’ (Prisko, 2009). Related to the notion of play are holidays and celebrations that are also characterized by their restriction to a certain place and time outside everyday routine (Turner, 1977). As the special issues mark a ‘‘holiday’’ (the opening of Book Week), the project was widely described as a celebration. These notions routinely materialize in journalistic work through special holiday editions and supplements and may also be connected to media events (Dayan and Katz, 1992). Although they manifest a digression from everyday routine which is deeply routinized in journalism, in the present context they led mostly to the conclusion that the project was not journalism and thus bore no new lessons about journalism. ‘‘Real Journalism is . . .’’ Three characteristics of the project served to justify its definition as ‘‘not real journalism’’: its one-time publication, the identity of its writers and its content. In discussing these characteristics, the interpretive community mostly adopted a very narrow professional understanding, in which ‘‘journalism’’ is reduced to uniform, constant production of ‘‘news,’’ and ‘‘journalist’’ is a synonym for reporter (while editors and writers who are not reporters are ignored). 1. ‘‘The mother of all routines.’’ Many respondents emphasized the project’s one-time nature. Using the project’s exceptionality as justification for a conclusion that it was not journalism, a former Haaretz editor-in-chief wrote online (Marmari, 2009): The issue points to everything that is not routinely done. [But] journalism is the mother of all routines. Having hired dozens of journalists, I learned not to be entranced by a singular brilliant creation . . . Any kid can write great reportage, but a journalist has to write thousands of words and still remain fresh. We will meet tomorrow . . . at the battered, barren and bitter routine of everyday life. Routine and its violation in the project were also emphasized by the project’s editors. One said: ‘‘Journalists here tend to stick to routine. [. . .Every time I suggest a change, I am told:] ‘It is not fitting for Haaretz, not fit to print, not fitting for Israel.’ Everyone is comfortable with doing nothing new.’’ In the second year of publication (2010), that terminated the project’s status as a one-time event and routinized it, the interpretive community hardly reacted at all. When asked about responses to the second issue, one project editor said: Last year, . . . senior reporters approached me, concerned . . . This year, it was smoothly accepted into the family. It is surprising how fast the project became an acceptable tradition, nothing to fuss about, . . . a day off . . . The readers like it too, as long as it remains in its imaginary bubble, exceptional, rare. But if we render it every day, they will send letters saying: ‘‘this joke must be halted.’’ Although an interpretation of silence is speculative by nature, it appears that in 2010, the community, both within and outside Haaretz, acknowledged routinization of the project silently. What was a challenging ‘‘experiment’’ in 2009 became a ‘‘special issue’’*a much less challenging category of digression from routine newswork. By becoming AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 9 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n11. routinized, the project no longer threatened understanding of journalism as ‘‘the mother of all routines.’’ Thus, the change in reaction does not reflect a change in perception of journalism, but rather in perception of the relations between (conservatively defined) journalism and the project. This correlates with the estimate offered in 2010 by one project editor, who claimed the project had no impact on the newspaper’s everyday work. 2. ‘‘A profession.’’ The second argument that served to distance the project from ‘‘real journalism’’ was the well-known claim that journalism is a distinct profession, which should be practiced by trained professionals (Lemann, 2006). Speaking on a television show, Amnon Dankner, former editor-in-chief of another Israeli daily and presently an author, called the project ‘‘proof that journalists have to deal with journalism and authors with stories’’ (Bergman and Lipkin-Shahak, 2009). One reporter wrote in the survey: ‘‘Just as shoemakers cannot write a newspaper, neither can authors. They are not familiar with its working methods.’’ The relevant literature mentions many professional qualities that journalists (or, to be precise, reporters) possess (or should possess) (Reich, 2009). Of these, the discourse focuses on three characteristics: a critical approach, writing skills and curiosity and inspiration. Critical approach. Journalists’ criticality is addressed in the literature as both a professional virtue and a journalistic bias (Galtung and Ruge, 1981; Schudson, 2003). At least four authors testified that they refused to write critically. Dankner said that ‘‘as a journalist I have to be judgmental. As an author, I don’t judge my characters. I love them all’’ (Bergman and Lipkin-Shahak, 2009) The issue was also examined on a radio program by two prominent journalists, Razi Barkai and Motti Kirschenbaum (Barkai, 2009), who discussed the leading story of the special issue*an interview with Defense Minister Ehud Barak conducted by author Etgar Keret. The item was entitled ‘‘Barak: This Government Will Surprise People Yet.’’ Its lead was: ‘‘What is nice about community centers is that they all look the same. The same ugly potted plants in the lobby, the same colorful tiles in the men’s bathrooms . . . The same is true of speeches by Israeli politicians . . . a little peace, an open hand extended to our neighbors, an existential threat or two.’’ Probably unaware of their conservatism, Barkai and Kirschenbaum reduced ‘‘critical approach’’ to ‘‘direct attack’’ and ‘‘journalistic work’’ to ‘‘produce a headline’’: Kirschenbaum: I love Keret’s literature, but he is no journalist. There is something a little amateurish, naı̈ve, about his interviewing Barak. We would not have given Barak the oxygen Keret gave him. [. . .] Barkai: And still, he produced a headline*that this government will surprise us yet.Kirschenbaum: That’s a limited headline. You know very well how many times we heard that someone will surprise us yet, but in the end there’s no surprise. Writing skills. Obviously, the issue of writing stood at the heart of the discourse. The interpretive community appears to agree that there are fundamental differences between literary and journalistic writing and that literary writing is somehow better than journalistic writing. Not surprisingly, the authors in particular tend to uphold this notion. Possible problematic characteristics of literary journalism, such as data-gathering methods and 10 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n12. epistemology (Aucoin, 2001), were not mentioned, probably because the authors, as attested to in their interviews, made a special effort to be very precise in their reports. At the same time, the interpretive community apparently agrees that ‘‘good writing’’ can and should appear in journalism. The questions were: What is its importance in journalistic professionalism? (Örnebring, 2009). Is ‘‘good writing’’ necessary for professional journalism or is it just a welcome addition? Answers to these questions varied significantly, ranging from minimization of writing (‘‘after all, writing is just a very small element of the job’’; Kishtwari, 2009) to ruling that ‘‘despite differences between journalists and authors, at the end of the day those who deal with writing have to know how to write’’ (Glico, 2009). Perhaps revealing his fears, a reporter told one project editor that ‘‘the project proved that to be a journalist, good writing is not enough.’’ The project’s editors, on the other hand, considered good writing to be a key reason for their initiative. ‘‘Ultimately, good writing is the most desired and the rarest boon today, compensating for many journalistic misdemeanors,’’ one editor said. He added: ‘‘Journal- ism has to go back to its traditional basis of storytelling . . . A professional journalist today is a technician who knows how to write texts that fit conventional packaging, to work with templates.’’ Inspiration and curiosity. The same editor linked storytelling skills and inspiration: Inspiration and esprit are almost considered dirty words in journalism, but these are our only advantages over other media . . . Many reporters have tradition, but not inspir- ation . . . Their routine makes them dull. In retrospect, the project was our attempt to remain ourselves what we really want to do*[produce] a newspaper with inspiration. Other editors addressed an alleged lack of curiosity among professional journalists, claiming that ‘‘the reporter is always closed in by the who-what-where . . . Authors are always curious. And this is what journalism needs*to go back to journalists’ natural curiosity.’’ Not surprisingly, the emphasis on inspiration and curiosity, which are hardly mentioned in the professional ideology of journalism (Darnton, 1975, p. 192), appeared most prominently among Haaretz editors. Relying on these characteristics and the quality of writing, they offered a critical evaluation of journalists’ work routines on the practical and conceptual levels. This critique served the editors to justify the project but was rejected by the majority of the interpretive community, that primarily framed reporters’ professionalism in positive or neutral terms. 3. ‘‘The production of news.’’ A third argument distancing the project from ‘‘real journalism’’ was a dismissive claim that journalism’s main product is news coverage. Accordingly, journalists were perceived solely as reporters and journalistic work was reduced to news gathering. The proponents of this view overlooked the problem, however, taking it for granted that, in the words of one Haaretz reporter: ‘‘The role of a newspaper is to provide the news of the day.’’ Addressing the same point from an opposite perspective, one project editor also acknowledged the project’s divergence from traditional newswork but rejected the idea of news presentation as the newspaper’s raison d’être. ‘‘I don’t think people expect newspapers to provide them with news anymore,’’ he said. He explained that instead of news, the project offers readers ‘‘something much more important*well-written stories AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 11 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n13. about current realities.’’ Even if the exact difference between these two notions remains somewhat ambiguous, the concept of journalism is broadened here, as ‘‘stories about current realities’’ legitimate non-traditional presentation. As stated, however, this perspective was rejected or ignored by most of the interpretive community. Reflecting on Print Journalism Past and Future The interpretive community appeared thrilled with the exciting publication of Haaretz of the Authors, yet promptly rejected it as a deviation from journalism. It may be argued that conservative interpretations are typical of institutionalized professional communities. Such interpretations make very little sense, however, in situations in which the medium (and perhaps also the profession) faces an existential danger. A radical and expanding interpretation would appear to be a better tactic in such cases, as it bears the option of renewal and adaptation. An interpretive community that faces harsh challenges and still prefers to close itself off to new ideas appears to be suicidal, reminiscent of the whales that swim onto the beach and die. Considering the case of Haaretz, the only quality daily newspaper in Israel, this suicidal reaction was deeply connected to the community’s dialectic perception of print journalism’s past and future. On the one hand, the project was framed as innovative, ‘‘a first gesture in the history of Israeli journalism’’ (Gadot, 2009), but on the other, it was considered*most prominently in readers’ letters*as a return to ‘‘old-time journalism’’ with ‘‘the flavor of the past.’’ The dialectic between past and future was largely framed pessimistically and passively, whereas nostalgic longing for an (imagined) past was emphasized over imaginative hope for the future. A former Haaretz editor-in-chief wrote: This is an issue of longing, a gesture to what journalism might have been and could have been had it prospered . . . We must remember: Were [the authors] Haaretz employees, some would have been summoned by the management for a businesslike chat: ‘‘It looks like we have to say goodbye, or at least cut your salary in half.’’ (Marmari, 2009) This tension*between past and future, conservatism and progress, the chains of tradition and the horizon of future survival*was addressed pessimistically by one of the editors: Haaretz is torn between its heritage and financial realities . . . If Haaretz does not change, it will close in three years. Our choice is between living ugly and dying beautifully, while holding to tradition. Our readers want us to die beautifully. A few days after the [first] publication, I was depressed by their enthusiasm . . . I realized we could not free ourselves of Haaretz’s DNA, within the readers and within ourselves. Ironically, we tried to do something new, but ended up producing the epitome of the ‘old Haaretz spirit.’ Preposterously, it was the most anticipated surprising move Haaretz could make.3 A year later, after publication of the second issue, we asked this editor if his position had changed. He said that he is even more pessimistic, mostly blaming the (imagined) audience for preventing changes, claiming that readers ‘‘don’t want their cheese to be moved’’ and lamenting that ‘‘our readers strangle us. They force us to commit suicide, but if we cut ourselves off from them, we will die as well. The question is do you prefer to die by your lover’s hand or your own.’’ Our analysis reveals that it was a projection: It was not 12 HAGAR LAHAV AND ZVI REICH Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n14. the (imagined) readers but the journalists’ community that strangled the project with their conservatism. Conclusions This study focuses on the interpretation of an experimental novelty by a journalistic professional community. It perceives the experience as part of a broader trend of changes in journalism that blurs the boundaries of the profession. The Haaretz case study, however, provides an example of journalistic innovation that is only indirectly connected with technological change. It brought to light circumstances in which professional boundaries are blurred and journalists’ symbolic capital is threatened*not by application of new technologies but by the introduction of experimental or unorthodox organizational and professional measures. Consequently, the study warns of technocentrism, that puts all the explanatory eggs in the perforated technological basket. Focusing instead on the rule of journalists’, readers’ and commentators’ attitudes within the adaptation process, the study suggests that when addressing cases that somehow challenge the stability of professional boundaries, the interpretive community can accept a given case as a rather legitimate digression from everyday journalism or reject it as deviation there from. The latter interpretation narrows the boundaries of journalism, while the former expands them. As newspapers now (and to a certain degree, maybe journalism itself) have to reinvent themselves or die, interpretation of such cases is crucial for their survival. Interpretation may be the bottleneck in newspapers’ ability to become flexible, refreshed and adaptive. In the case of Haaretz of the Authors*which was deemed more interesting than regular issues by a majority of the interpretive community*the professional community could have adopted this routine-breaking measure to draw conclusions about such issues as: the importance of quality writing; the limitations of technical, formulaic writing; the potential of breaking routine to produce an interesting newspaper; the added value of genuine curiosity; or the broadening potential of perceiving journalism as production of ‘‘well written stories about present reality’’ and not only as news reports. Such conclusions would have strengthened Kitch’s (2009, p. 341) suggestion that the ‘‘afterlife of print’’ is to be considered as ‘‘a keepsake, . . . a material culture rather than an information-delivery vehicle . . ., a memory object containing shared identity, a collective expression of ‘How We Lived.’’’ However, an overwhelming majority of the interpretive community rejected these optional conclusions. Based on a mix of data collection methods*interviews with editors and authors, a survey of journalists and collecting comments in the media and in readers’ responses*we were able to map the discursive means that served to entrench conservatism. According to the data, in 2009, the project was rejected by framing it as ‘‘not real journalism.’’ Journalists used three main discursive means to establish and justify this frame: they perceived ‘‘real journalism’’ as ongoing steady production; as the outcome of conventional news-gathering routines (while minimizing the importance of quality writing and inspiration); and as news provision. Although the professional community acknowledges the troubling fact that it has no future without change, it rejected change nonetheless. While this rejection may be understood, considering the present undermining of journalists’ symbolic power, the AUTHORS AND POETS WRITE THE NEWS 13 Downloaded By: [Lahav, Hagar] At: 19:49 18 March 2011\n\n15. community’s adoption of a highly conservative and narrow perception of journalism demonstrates a lack of flexibility and poor adaptation skills. Analysis of the community’s discourse is raising serious concerns about the ability of the Israeli press to reinvent itself. The community’s obstinacy in its interpretation of change indicates that this school of whales is headed for the beach. Even if we assume that this case study reflects trends within other Western press realms, the process of interpretation is always particular and contingent, as it is accomplished within a particular culture. Thus, the study indicates the need for more evidence from other cultures. Research on journalistic experiences is becoming highly relevant as news organizations tend to become more experimental in problematic times (Ryfe, 2009). Analyzing such cases and their interpretation may assist in assessment of the likelihood of change and in revealing the tension between tradition and renewal in current journalism. The coming years will probably give rise to more research opportunities of the type addressed in this study. Scholars seeking to avail themselves of these opportunities should remain alert and prepare themselves methodologically to handle case studies demanding research response at short notice. Furthermore, they need to gain a temporal perspective, as our findings demonstrate that interpretations of innovations tend to change over time.

Four authors who carried out news assignments refused to be interviewed or did not reply to our repeated e-mails. 2. When asked to define the project, 47 percent called it ‘‘an experiment in journalism,’’ 26 percent ‘‘a journalistic accomplishment,’’ 18 percent ‘‘a gimmick or a marketing move,’’ 1.7 percent ‘‘a mistake’’ and 5 percent ‘‘other.’’ 3. The idea that the project was not subversive enough was also suggested by one journalist in the survey and in Editors Weblog: ‘‘One day, we may even see a newspaper hand over the reins to a selection of readers rather than a group of intellectuals . . . That would take courage’’ (Kishtwari, 2009). REFERENCES ATTON, CHRIS (2002) Alternative Media, London: Sage. ATTON, CHRIS (2003) ‘‘What Is ‘Alternative’ Journalism’’, Journalism 4(3), pp. 26772.
