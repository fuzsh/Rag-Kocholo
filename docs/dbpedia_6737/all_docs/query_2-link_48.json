Grunis, President M. Naor, Deputy President. E. Rubinstein, Justice S. Joubran, Justice H. Melcer, Justice Y. Danziger, Justice N. Hendel, Justice U. Vogelman, Justice I. Amit\n\nResponses to an Order Nisi\n\nFacts: The petitions sought to void the Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by means of Boycott Law, 5711-2011 (hereinafter: the Boycott Law or the Law). The Law attributes tortious liability and establishes various administrative restrictions against anyone who knowingly publishes a public call to impose a boycott on the State of Israel, as defined by the Law. The Petitioners argued that the Law was unconstitutional for infringing various constitutional rights (inter alia, freedom of expression, the right to equality, freedom of occupation), without meeting the conditions of the “Limitation Clauses” of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation.\n\nThe High Court of Justice, in an expanded bench of nine justices, held:\n\nThe Court unanimously decided to void sec. 2(c) of the Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by means of Boycott Law, 5711-2011, and to deny the petitions in regard to secs. 3 and 4 of the Law. Additionally, the majority (per Melcer J., Grunis P., Naor P., Rubinstein D.P., and Amit J. concurring) denied the petitions in regard to secs. 2(a) and 2(b) of the Law, against the dissenting opinion of Danziger J., Joubran J. concurring, and the separate dissents of Hendel J. and Vogelman J.\n\nJustice Melcer: From the language of the Law, we learn that anyone who knowingly publishes a call for the imposition of a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, may be deemed to have committed a tort. Moreover, the participation of such a person, or one who has committed to participate in such a boycott, may be restricted, and it is possible that such a person may be prevented from receiving various financial benefits (governmental grants, tax exemptions, state guarantees, etc.). Thus, most of the sanctions imposed by the Law already apply at the speech stage. Therefore, the Boycott Law indeed infringes freedom of expression and is repugnant to the constitutional right to human dignity. However, in the opinion of Justice Melcer, we are not concerned here with an infringement of the core of freedom of expression, even where political speech is concerned, inasmuch as the infringement is relatively limited, and applies only to a call for a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, or anyone who commits to participate in such a boycott, which is a legal act that exceeds speech.\n\nHowever, that constitutional right, like all other constitutional rights in Israel, is not absolute, but rather relative, and may be restricted if the infringement meets the requirements of the “Limitation Clause” in sec. 8 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. As is well known, the Limitation Clause comprises four cumulative tests: the infringement of the constitutional right must be made by a law or by virtue of a law; it must befit the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state; it must serve a proper purpose; and it may only infringe the right to an extent no greater than is required. The last condition comprises three subtests, which are: the rational connection test, the least harmful means test, and the proportionality “stricto sensu” test. For the purpose of this examination, Justice Melcer also made recourse to comparative law.\n\nThere is no dispute that the first condition is met. As for the remaining conditions, Justice Melcer was of the opinion that the provisions of the Law that are intended to prevent harm to the State of Israel by means of an economic, cultural, or academic boycott of a person or any other entity, merely due to its connection to the State of Israel, one of its institutions, or an area under its control, fall under the doctrine of “defensive democracy”, and promote protection of the state and its institutions, as well as equality and personal liberty, and the Law, therefore, is intended for a proper purpose that befits the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Justice Melcer was also of the opinion that “calls for a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, do not serve the classical purpose of freedom of expression”. This view is based upon Justice Melcer’s distinction between speech intended to “persuade” and speech employed as a “means of coercion”. In his opinion, a call for a boycott is a form of coercive expression, and therefore, it is entitled to less protection that that afforded to other types of political speech.\n\nHowever, in the context of examining the fourth condition – proportionality – and in accordance with a narrow interpretive approach, Justice Melcer concluded that whereas secs. 2(a), 2(b), 3 and 4 of the Law meet the conditions of the proportionality test, sec. 2(c) of the Law does not meet the demands of the least harmful means test.\n\nIn this context, Justice Melcer referred to the chilling-effect doctrine, which addresses a deterrent effect that extends beyond the scope of expression intended by the legislature, and proposed limiting this chilling effect by means of narrow construction that would somewhat restrict the bounds of the tort under sec. 2(a) of the Law. Justice Melcer therefore recommended that the realization of the “boycott tort” be contingent upon the existence of damage, and a causal connection between the tortious conduct and the damage. However, a potential causal connection would not suffice. Rather, there must be awareness of the reasonable possibility that the call and the circumstances of its publication would lead to the imposition of a boycott, and the right to bring suit must be reserved only to the direct victim of the tort.\n\nBy accepting this interpretive approach, sec. 2(b) of the Law would also be constitutional. Pursuant to that, it was further held, inter alia, that a person seeking damages under sec. 2(b) of the Law would have to prove not only the element of a call for a boycott, but also the following elements: causation as defined in sec. 62(a) of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance, breach, a causal connection between the boycott and the breach, a mental element of awareness, and monetary loss.\n\nOn the other hand, as far as sec. 2(c), concerning damages not contingent upon damage (that might be categorized as “punitive damages”) and which are not capped by any ceiling in this regard, Justice Melcer was of the opinion that this section did not meet the second test of the least harmful means test, and must be voided.\n\nThus, in accordance with this approach, even if a person calling for a boycott be found liable in tort, the damages that would be imposed upon him would not exceed the harm that he actually caused.\n\nIn regard to secs. 3 and 4 of the Law, Justice Melcer was of the opinion that the administrative sanctions – preventing participation in tenders and restricting the possibility of obtaining public benefits – constitute merely “second order” infringements of freedom of expression. Accordingly, these are proportionate sanctions in view of the procedures required for the approval of the restrictions, and in view of the state’s right to withhold benefits from anyone who employs them against the state. He does not distinguish, in this regard, between a boycott against the state and a boycott against the Area. According to his approach, the constitutionality of secs. 3 and 4 of the Law should not be addressed until specific petitions are filed in the matter of an actual decision by the Treasury, on the basis of a concrete factual foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, Justice Melcer drew additional support for the proposed approach, inter alia: a construction of a law that places it within constitutional boundaries is preferable to striking it down; respect for the legislature by virtue of deference; the margin-of-appreciation theory; the ripeness doctrine as applied to the matter before the Court requires that, other than the striking down of sec. 2(c) of the Law , the claims of potential claimants or potential defendants in regard to the Law be examined in the course of applied review.\n\nPresident (Emeritus) A. Grunis, President M. Naor, Deputy President E. Rubinstein, and Justice I. Amit concurred in the opinion of Justice Melcer in separate opinions.\n\nJustice Y. Danziger: The Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by means of Boycott Law substantially violates freedom of expression. We are concerned with an infringement of the freedom of political expression, which is at the “core” of the constitutional right to freedom of expression, and which forms part of the constitutional right to human dignity. Under his approach, that infringement does not meet the requirements of the Limitation Clause under sec. 8 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty because the Law does not pass the third subtest of proportionality – proportionality “stricto sensu” – particularly in regard to a call for a boycott of the Area, inasmuch as calling for a boycott of the Area is a subject that is clearly within the bounds of legitimate democratic discourse. In his view, the narrow interpretive approach proposed by Justice Melcer is insufficient.\n\nDespite that conclusion, Justice Danziger was of the opinion that it would be possible to avoid the extreme result of voiding the Law for unconstitutionality through an interpretation that would significantly reduce the Law’s infringement and permit the Law to pass the constitutionality tests. This could be accomplished by establishing that sec. 1 of the Law, which is the Law’s “entry way”, be construed as such that only a boycott of an “institution” or “area” that is a boycott of the State of Israel and derives from the institution or area belonging to the state would fall within the scope of the Law’s definition, whereas a boycott of an “institution” or “area” that is not part of a boycott of the State of Israel in its entirety would not fall within the Law’s definition. In other words, the Law should be interpreted as applying only to calls for a boycott of the State of Israel in its entirety, but not to calls to boycott the Area alone.\n\nJustice N. Hendel accepted the solution proposed by Justice Melcer as a legitimate interpretation of the Law. However, in his view, section 2 in its entirety – sec. 2(a) establishing boycott as a tort, sec. 2(b) establishing that a person calling for a boycott, as defined by the Law, acts without sufficient justification in regard to the tortious inducement of breach of contract, and sec. 2(c) in regard to damages without proof of damage – does not meet the third constitutional test of proportionality – proportionality stricto sensu. Therefore, Justice Hendel was of the opinion that sec. 2 of the Law should be struck down in its entirety for lack of proportionality, but concurred in the approval of secs. 3 and 4 for the time being.\n\nJustice U. Vogelman concurred with the general approach of Justice Danziger, but was of the opinion that the “blue pencil” rule should be adopted in this regard. Accordingly, the words “an area under its control” should be stricken from sec. 1 of the Law. In his view, sec. 2(c), as well, should be struck down, while retaining secs. 3 and 4. Additionally, in his view, the validity of the Law requires that it be interpreted in such a manner that it would apply only to those cases in which the sole reason for the call for “refraining from economic, cultural or academic ties with another person” is the connection to the State of Israel or one of its institutions.\n\nJustice S. Joubran was of the opinion that sec. 2(c) of the Law should be struck down, and that sec. 1 should be interpreted as proposed by Justice Y. Danziger in regard to areas under the control of the state. In addition, like Justices Y. Danziger and I. Amit, he was of the opinion that a distinction should be drawn between calling for a boycott against a person due to his connection to the State of Israel or one of its institutions, and a call for a boycott against a person due to his connection to an area under the control of the state.\n\nJudgment\n\nJustice H. Melcer\n\n1. The Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by means of Boycott Law, 5711-2011 (hereinafter: the Boycott Law or the Law) [https://www.nevo.co.il/law/78646], imposes tortious liability and establishes various administrative restrictions upon anyone who knowingly publishes a public call to impose a boycott on the State of Israel, as defined by the Law. Does the Law infringe the right to freedom of expression and other constitutional rights? Does that infringement, to the extent that it may exist, meet the tests of the “Limitation Clauses” of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation? These are the questions upon which the petitions before us focus.\n\nI will begin by presenting the relevant, basic information.\n\n2. On July 11, 2011, the Knesset enacted the Boycott Law. Inasmuch as the Law is concise, I will first present its full text:\n\nDefinition:\n\nIn this law, \"a boycott against the State of Israel\" means – deliberately refraining from economic, cultural or academic ties with another person or body solely because of its connection with the State of Israel, one of its institutions or an area under its control, such that it may cause economic, cultural or academic harm.\n\nBoycott – Civil Wrong:\n\n2. (a) Anyone who knowingly publishes a public call for a boycott against the State of Israel, where according to the content and circumstances of the publication there is a reasonable possibility that the call will lead to a boycott, and the publisher was aware of that possibility, commits a civil wrong and the provisions of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance [New Version] will apply to him.\n\n(b) In regards to section 62(A) of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance [New Version], anyone who causes a binding legal agreement to be breached by calling for a boycott against the State of Israel will not be deemed as having acted with sufficient justification.\n\n(c) If the court find that a civil wrong, as defined by this law, was committed with malice, it may require the tortfeasor to pay damages that are independent of the actual damage caused (in this section – exemplary damages); in calculating the sum of exemplary damages, the court will consider, inter alia, the circumstances under which the wrong was carried out, its severity and its extent.\n\nDirectives restricting participation in tenders:\n\n3. The Minister of Finance is authorized, with the consent of the Minister of Justice and the approval of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, to issue directives in regard to restricting the participation in a tender of anyone who knowingly published a public call for a boycott against the State of Israel, or who committed to participate in such a boycott, including a commitment not to purchase goods or services produced or supplied in Israel, by one of its institutions, or in an area under its control; in this section, a “tender” is defined as any tender that must be administered in accordance with the Mandatory Tenders Law, 5752-1992.\n\nRegulations preventing benefits:\n\n4. (a) The Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Minister of Justice, may decide that someone who knowingly published a public call for a boycott against the State of Israel or committed to participate in a boycott:\n\n(1) Will not be deemed a public institution under clause 46 of the Income Tax Ordinance;\n\n(2) Will not be eligible to receive monies from the Sports Betting Council under section 9 of the Regulation of Sports Betting Law, 5727-1967; exercise of the authority under this section requires the consent of the Minister of Culture and Sports;\n\n(3) Will not be deemed a public institution under section 3A of the Foundations of the Budget Law. 5745-1985, regarding the receipt of support under any budget line item; exercise of the authority under this section requires the consent of the Minister appointed by the Government as responsible for said budgetary line, as stated in section 2 of the definition of “person responsible for a budget line item”;\n\n(4) Will not be eligible for guarantees under the State Guarantees Law, 5718-1958;\n\n(5) Will not be eligible for benefits under the Encouragement of Capital Investment Law, 5719-1959, or under to the Encouragement of Research and Development in Industry Law, 5744-1984; exercise of the authority under this section requires the consent of the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Employment.\n\n(b) In exercising the authority according to subsection (a), the Minister of Finance will act in accordance with regulations that he will promulgate in this regard, with the consent of the Minister of Justice, and with the approval of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee; however, if no such regulations have been promulgated, it will not detract from the authority under subsection (a).\n\nImplementation:\n\n5. The Minister of Justice is appointed to implement this law.\n\nEffective Date:\n\n6. Section 4 shall come into force ninety days from the publication of this law.\n\n(For convenience, the tortious liability imposed under section 2 of the Law shall be referred to hereinafter as “the boycott tort”, and the provisions established under sections 3 and 4 will be referred to hereinafter as “the administrative restrictions”. The three aforesaid sections shall together be referred to hereinafter as “the Law’s sanctions”).\n\n3. The legislative process of the Law was complex, and I will, therefore, briefly present its steps and what accompanied them, immediately below:\n\nA. On July 5, 2010, the Prevention of Harm to the State of Israel by means of Boycott Bill, 5770-2010, was tabled before the eighteenth Knesset (the text of the Bill was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/1). The Bill was initiated by twenty-five members of Knesset from various parties, both of the coalition and opposition. The Bill was approved in a preliminary reading on July 14, 2010, and was transferred to the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee (hereinafter: the Committee, or the Constitution Committee) for preparation for a first reading.\n\nB. The Committee conducted its first discussion of the Bill on Feb. 15, 2011 (the protocol of the meeting was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/2). The Bill was presented at the outset of the meeting by one of its initiators, MK Zev Elkin, who explained that the original draft of the Bill was broader, but pursuant to the decision of the Ministerial Committee for Legislation in this regard, the scope of the Bill was limited by the removal of sections of the Bill concerning calls for boycott by a party who is not a citizen or resident of Israel, a boycott imposed by an organ of a foreign state, and retroactive force of the legislation. MK Elkin explained that the Law was intended to provide a response to an absurd situation that had arose, in which, as he explained, states friendly to Israel prohibit the imposition of a boycott upon the state, and impose sanctions upon bodies that seek to join a boycott of Israel, while there is no parallel sanction in Israeli law. Accordingly, in his words: “This law is intended to protect the State of Israel, at least minimally. An Israeli citizen who acts against it must know that he will bear the consequences” [ibid., p. 3 of the protocol of the meeting].\n\nIn the course of that meeting, several members of the Committee expressed their opposition to the Bill. Among other things, they argued that it was an anti-democratic bill that restricted freedom of expression, that boycotting was a legitimate civil means for expressing dissent, and that the Law would ultimately harm the State of Israel. The legal advisor of the Foreign Ministry, Advocate Ehud Keinan, noted that, in his opinion, the Law would not be helpful in the fight against boycotting Israel, and might even harm that effort (ibid., pp. 21-22 of the above protocol). The representative of the Manufacturers Association, Mr. Netanel Heiman, expressed reservations about the Bill, and argued that it should conform to the existing American law on the subject (ibid., pp. 22-23 of the above protocol). Similarly, Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer, who appeared before the committee, noted that “if this bill were constructed along the lines of existing models in the world, I would not have a word to say on the constitutional level” (ibid., p. 28 of the above protocol). Prof. Kremnitzer, however, added that the Bill – in the form presented – infringes fundamental rights, among them the right to freedom of expression (ibid., pp. 29-30 of the above protocol).\n\nThe representatives of the Ministry of Justice explained at the meeting that even after the removal of certain sections of the Bill, as aforementioned, the prohibitions established under the Bill remain too broad and should be limited (ibid., pp. 17-19 of the above protocol). In response, the legal advisor of the Committee, Advocate Sigal Kogut, explained that changes would be made in the wording of the Bill in order to more precisely define the term “boycott” in the Law, as well as the conduct element it comprises (ibid., p. 32 of the above protocol). At the end of the meeting, the Committee approved the Bill for a first reading by a majority vote.\n\nC. On Feb. 28, 2011, even before the Bill was tabled before the Knesset for a first reading, the Committee approved a request for a revision of the Bill. Pursuant to that, the Committee was presented a revised draft of the Bill that was the result of discussions between MK Elkin and the Legal Advisors of the Committee and the Knesset (the meeting protocol was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/3). In accordance with the comments of the Knesset Legal Advisor, the definition of the term “a boycott against the State of Israel\" in the amended Bill (sec. 1 of the original Bill) was narrowed, and the criminal prohibition of a call for a boycott against the State of Israel was removed (sec. 2 of the original Bill). However, it was agreed that the latter would be reconsidered in the framework of preparing the Bill for a second and third reading (see: the Explanatory Notes to the Bill that were published by the initiating members of Knesset and the Constitution Committee in 5771 H.H. 373, p. 112 of March 2, 2011). Ultimately, at the request of the Committee chair, MK David Rotem, a section was added to the Bill stating that the Minister of Finance, with the consent of the Constitution Committee, may establish provisions restricting the participation of participants in the boycott against the State of Israel in public tenders (ibid., pp. 3-4 of the above protocol).\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the amended Bill was approved for a first reading by a majority vote with eight supporting and four opposing, and it was also approved by the Knesset plenum in a first reading on March 7, 2011 by a majority of 32 in favor and 12 opposed, with no abstentions. The Bill was then returned to the Constitution Committee for preparation for a second and third reading.\n\nD. On June 27, 2011, the Constitution Committee discussed the Bill in the framework of its preparation for second and third readings (the protocol of the meeting was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/5). Prior to the said meeting, the members of Knesset were presented with an amended version of the Bill, which was prepared in cooperation with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, following the Bill’s approval in the first reading. This draft included a list of additional provisions regarding the denial of financial benefits from the state to anyone calling for a boycott against the State of Israel (as defined in the Bill), or anyone undertaking to participate in such a boycott (the text of the amended Bill was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/6).\n\nIn the course of the meeting, the Deputy Attorney General (Criminal Affairs), Advocate Raz Nizri, explained that the Bill, as presented to the Committee, accords with the course that “the Attorney General agreed to follow” (protocol of the meeting of June 27, 2011, p. 15). However, Advocate Nizri stressed that the Attorney General’s position is that the legal course presented “is very, very marginal” and that it “raises not insignificant problems”, and therefore, in his opinion, any further change in the wording of the Bill “endangers this already unstable structure” (loc. cit.). In this regard, Advocate Nizri noted the importance of retaining the requirement of a mental element of “malice” as a condition for imposing exemplary damages (sec. 2(c) of the Bill), and for retaining the various conditions established in the Bill in regard to denying benefits provided by the state (ibid., pp. 21-26 of the above meeting protocol). The representative of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate Roni Neubauer, also underlined that in light of the exceptionality of “punitive damages” in the civil law, they should be conditioned upon an element of “malice” on the part of the tortfeasor, and should be limited to situations in which the court wishes to express real abhorrence at the tortfeasor’s conduct (ibid., pp. 70-71 of the above meeting protocol).\n\nThe representative of the legal department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Advocate Karin Dosoretz, stressed that the Foreign Ministry shared the desire to fight the boycott phenomenon, but the Ministry was of the opinion that the Bill might lead to the opposite result (ibid., p. 58 of the above meeting protocol). The Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Finance, Advocate Joel Baris, emphasized that “the Government decided to support the Bill,” and therefore he was speaking “within that framework”, however, in continuing, he took the view that sec. 3 of the Bill was problematic in that it sought to introduce political values into the procedure. He added that that could carry a hidden price that could not be estimated in terms of its budgetary effect. He also expressed his fear of transferring decisions on matters tangential to the political sphere to civil servants (ibid., p. 72-73 of the above meeting protocol). It should be noted that, as will be explained below, this comment by Advocate Baris found expression in the final version of the Law, which established that the exercise of the authority by the Minister of Finance under sec. 4 of the Law would be by in accordance with regulations that would require the approval of the Constitution Committee (however, such regulations have not yet been promulgated).\n\nThe representative of the legal department of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Employment, Advocate Deborah Milstein, explained that the restrictions that the Law established in regard to participating in public tenders do not infringe Israel’s international obligations, inasmuch as under the Mandatory Tenders Law, 5752-1992 (hereinafter: the Mandatory Tenders Law), the directives that will be issued under the Law will be subject to the international treaties to which Israel is a party (ibid., p. 72 of the above meeting protocol).\n\nIn the course of the said meeting, many Knesset members expressed their opposition to the Bill, and some of them argued that even the amended version of the Bill was too broad, infringed freedom of expression, and might accelerate the process of Israel’s delegitimization.\n\nAs opposed to this, Prof. Gershon (Gerald) Steinberg of Bar Ilan University, who researches the anti-Israel boycott phenomenon, argued before the Committee that “anyone who thinks that the boycott, BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) process, is something narrow, something marginal, something that does not harm the continued existence of the State of Israel, does not understand the phenomenon”. He added that, in his opinion, anyone who opposes the Bill should suggest an alternative solution for the fight against the boycotts initiated against Israel (ibid., p. 63 of the above meeting protocol).\n\nThe Legal Advisor of the Committee, Advocate Sigal Kogut, explained that, in her opinion, there is a distinction between imposing restrictions on someone who calls for a boycott of the State of Israel, which can be justified, and the restrictions imposed upon someone who calls for the boycotting of a person due to his connection “to an area under its control”, which are problematic, in her view, and constitute “the primary constitutional problem in this tort” (ibid., p. 61 of the above meeting protocol).\n\nAt the request of MK Plesner, who was of the opinion that the section regarding the denial of benefits granted by the state to anyone who calls for a boycott constitutes “a deviation from the subject”, under sec. 120(a) of the Knesset Rules of Procedure (now sec. 85 of the Rules), the meeting of the Committee was adjourned, and the matter was referred to the House Committee for its decision. After the House Committee ruled that the matter did not constitute a “new subject”, the Constitution Committee’s meeting was resumed, and in the end, all the reservations in regard to the Bill were removed, and the Bill was approved for second and third readings by a majority vote of eight in favor and five opposed (the protocol of the resumed meeting of the Committee was appended to the Knesset’s response as R/7).\n\nE. On July 10, 2011, before the Bill was debated in the Knesset plenum, MK Plesner requested that the Legal Advisor of the Knesset state his opinion as to the constitutionality of the Bill. In his response to MK Plesner that same day, the Legal Advisor of the Knesset, Advocate Eyal Yinon, explained the problem that he found in imposing tortious liability upon someone who calls for boycotting a person due to his connection to “an area under the control” of the State of Israel, and wrote, inter alia, as follows:\n\n3. This tort [in the Law], together with the broad definition of the term “boycott against the State of Israel” […] creates a cause of action in tort for the payment of damages for calls for a boycott that are intended to influence the political dispute in regard to the future of Judea and Samaria, a dispute at the heart of the political discourse in the State of Israel for over forty years.\n\n4. Moreover, leaving the section as is in this wording will lead to a situation in which a call for a boycott in regard to one issue, and to one political position, will constitute a tort and grounds for other administrative sanctions, while a call for a boycott for other ideological, social or religious reasons will continue to be legitimate in the framework of public discourse. Thus, for example, a call for a boycott directed at artists who did not serve in the IDF, against universities that do not play the anthem at commencement exercises, against bodies that do not keep kosher, and of late, consumer boycotts against manufacturers and supermarket chains that sell products at prices that are viewed as too high, will not constitute grounds for any sanctions whatsoever, while calls for a boycott in regard to the dispute over the future of the areas of Judea and Samaria will be deemed a wrongful act that justifies the payment of damages.\n\n[…]\n\n5. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the definition of “boycott against the State of Israel” in this broad wording, together with the tort, should be seen as an infringement that goes to the heart of freedom of political expression in the State of Israel that brings these elements of the Bill to the brink of unconstitutionality, and perhaps even over it.\n\n(Emphasis original – H.M.; The letter of Knesset’s Legal Advisor was appended to the response of the Knesset as R/8).\n\nF. On the following day, July 11, 2011, the Bill was brought before the Knesset plenum for second and third readings. In the course of the plenum debate, MK Elkin clarified the reasoning grounding the extending of the Law to calls for boycotts related to Judea and Samaria (hereinafter: the Area), explaining as follows:\n\nAnyone who examines the legislation on the subject of boycotts and the subject of discrimination in the various countries will discover a very simple thing – that even in France, and even in Germany, and even in other countries, there are types of discrimination and types of boycotts that are forbidden and that are permitted. In general, there is a basic list of characteristics of a person that the law forbids to serve as grounds for discrimination and boycott: religion, race, nationality, sex. […] In my view, a person’s citizenship and place of residence are among the most basic characteristics. One can conduct a political struggle, but boycotting a person merely because he is a citizen of the State of Israel, particularly where this causes him injury, is prohibited. And if not prohibited, then at least a person who does so must be ready to bear the cost of the injury. […] There is no difference between a resident of Ariel and a resident of Tel Aviv. You want to use boycott as a means for a political struggle? Boycott. Boycott me, boycott Likud voters, whatever you like. But to boycott a person because of where he lives? […] The dispute over the borders of the state must be carried out here, and not at the expense of companies, and not at the expense of people who live there at the behest of the State of Israel. Some like it, some do not like it, but [this is] the place for deciding the dispute – not by boycotts [ibid., at pp. 168-169 of the protocol of the plenum debate; emphasis added – H.M.].\n\nMinister of Finance, MK Yuval Steinitz, also explained that he supported the Bill due to his principled objection to boycotts of distinct groups, in view of the belligerent character of this method, stating as follows:\n\nBoycott of one or another particular community is, in principle, not a proper expression of freedom of expression, freedom of debate, and freedom of speech, because a boycott is belligerent. It is an attempt to use force to harm and defeat a community that thinks differently, and therefore it makes sense for the state to protect itself and its ideological or ethnic communities from such types of boycotts. [Boycott] is a deplorable, belligerent phenomenon that is […] inconsistent with the democratic idea that we debate and decide in accordance with the majority opinion and not in accordance with the power of a group that thinks differently. Not by force, not by boycott, and not by ostracism [ibid., at p. 99 of the protocol of the plenum debate].\n\nMany members of Knesset expressed their opposition to the Bill, to a great extent for the same reasons expressed earlier in the meetings of the Constitution Committee referenced above.\n\nG. At the conclusion of the debate, the Bill was approved in a second and third reading by a majority of 47 in favor, 38 opposed, and no abstentions. In the course of the debate, a reservation submitted by the Ministry of Finance was adopted, according to which the exercise of the Minister of Finance’s authority under sec. 4 of the Law would be in accordance with regulations that would require the approval of the Constitution Committee, although it was also decided that if such regulations were not established, it would not detract from the authority granted under the section to the Minister of Finance.\n\n4. Following the enactment of the Law, the four petitions before us were filed. Three of the petitions ask for the voiding of the entire Law, while one (HCJ 5392/11) argues only for the voiding of section 2-3 of the Law.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 2012, a hearing on the petitions was held before a panel of three justices. Following the hearing, on Dec. 9, 2012, an order nisi was granted, ordering the Respondents to show cause why the Law, or at least sections 2-3 of the Law, should not be voided. In the said decision, it was further decided that the hearing on the responses to the order nisi would be conducted before an expanded panel, which convened on Feb. 16, 2014.\n\n5. Below, I will present the various parties to the petitions, and following that, I will present the responses of the Respondents. I will already state that, for the sake of clarity, and inasmuch as most of the arguments of the Petitioners and of the Respondents are repeated in the four petitions, with various differences in wording and structure, I will make a unified presentation of the gist of the arguments of the Petitioners and of the Respondents.\n\nThe Parties to the Petitions\n\n6. Petitioner 1 in HCJ 5239/11 (hereinafter: the Avneri Petition) is one of the founders of Petitioner 2 in this petition, which is an association that, inter alia, acts to advance a peaceful solution between the State of Israel and the Palestinians. The Petitioners in HCJ 5392?11 (hereinafter: the Barkai Petition) are citizens and residents of the state who see themselves as potential defendants under sec. 2 of the Law, and ask that they be permitted to call for a boycott of the settlements and products produced there (but not against the State of Israel as such). Petitioner 2 in HCJ 5549/11, MK Dr. Ahmed Tibi, is a member of Knesset on behalf of Petitioner 1 of this petition, which is a political party that was elected to the 19th Knesset (hereinafter: the Ta’al Petition). The Petitioners in HCJ 2072/12 (hereinafter: the Women’s Coalition Petition) are various associations that work, inter alia, for the realization of human rights and for equality among the citizens of the State of Israel.\n\nPrior to filing the petitions, Petitioner 2 in the Avneri Petition and Petitioner 1 in the Women’s Coalition Petition published lists of products originating in Jewish communities in the Area, in various ways, and called for boycotting them. However, pursuant to the passage of the Law, they ceased to do so, in fear that the Law’s sanctions would be enforced against them.\n\n7. The Respondents in the above Petitions are: the Knesset and the Speaker of the Knesset (above and hereinafter: the Knesset), the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice, and the Attorney General (hereinafter collectively: the Government), and the Legal Forum for Israel (hereinafter: the Legal Forum), which was heard in the proceedings at its request.\n\n8. The Respondents’ claim, upon which the petitions are grounded, is that the Boycott Law is inconsistent with the constitutional standards and values established in Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. However, before addressing the arguments of the parties in regard to the constitutional tests in detail, I will present two preliminary questions raised by the Respondents, and the Petitioners’ response to them.\n\nA. The focus of the Petition: According to the Respondents, the Petitioners’ arguments in the various petitions focus upon the claim that the Law restricts freedom of political expression in all that concerns the policy of the State of Israel in regard to the Area, and that the Law precludes calling for imposing a boycott due to the connection of a person or party to the Area. That being the case, the Respondents argue that the petitions are not directed at the constitutionality of the Law in its entirety, but are directed solely at the term “an area under its control” in the definition of “boycott against the State of Israel” in sec. 1 of the Law, and can, therefore, only lead to the deletion of those words.\n\nAs opposed to this, in the course of the hearing, the Respondents were asked if, indeed their petitions focused only upon the term “an area under its control” in sec. 1 of the Law, and some of them responded that their petitions were directed at the Law in its entirety.\n\nB. Ripeness: The Respondents are of the opinion that the petitions should be denied for lack of ripeness, lack of concreteness, and for generality. According to the Respondents, the Boycott Law has not yet been applied by the courts, and therefore, there is no need to decide the question of its constitutionality at this time. In regard to the tortious liability imposed by the Law, the trial court is granted broad discretion as to the construction of the elements of the tort, as well as in regard to the conditions for awarding damages. That being the case, the need for constitutional review of the Law – before the trial courts have addressed it in a concrete case – has not yet ripened. This is also the case in regard to the administrative restrictions imposed by the Law, regarding which the Minister of Finance is granted broad discretion in drafting the provisions that would lead to the imposition of the said sanctions. Moreover, at the time of the hearing (and to the best of my knowledge, to this day) the parameters for the Minister’s exercise of the said authority have not been established, and none of the Petitioners laid a clear foundation attesting to its having suffered injury as a result of the administrative restrictions. In light of the above, and despite the “chilling effect” that the Law may cause, the Respondents are of the opinion that the petitions are not yet ripe, and that should suffice for their denial in limine.\n\nAs opposed to this, the Petitioners argue that the question of overturning the Boycott Law is appropriate for consideration. According to the Petitioners in the Avneri Petition, since 1995 they have published lists of products produced in the Area and called for their boycott. Pursuant to the enactment of the Law, they have been forced to desist from that activity. Therefore, the Law has a “chilling effect” upon them, and therefore, as stated, the Petition to void the Law is ripe for decision. The Petitioners in the Women’s Coalition Petition joined that argument. In addition, all of the Petitioners argue that the scope of the Boycott Law is sufficiently clear, and there is no reason, in principle, to defer its review until after it is actually implmented.\n\nArguments in regard to the Constitutional Tests\n\n9. As noted, the Petitioners argue on the merits that the Boycott Law is unconstitutional. In their view, the Law infringes various constitutional rights (among them: freedom of expression, equality, and freedom of occupation), without meeting the criteria established in that regard in the “Limitations Clauses” of the aforementioned value-based Basic Laws. The Petitioners further note that this argument is also raised in the position expressed by the Legal Advisor of the Knesset (in his letter of July 10, 2011, referenced in para 3(E) above). As opposed to this, the Respondents are of the opinion that the Law meets the constitutional criteria.\n\nTherefore, I will now present the arguments of the parties in accordance with the various stages of the model for constitutional review.\n\nA. Infringement of a Constitutional Right\n\n10. First, the Petitioners argue that the Boycott Law infringes the right to freedom of expression. Infringing freedom of expression, including freedom of political expression, has been recognized in the case law as an infringement of human dignity. According to the Petitioners, boycotting is a legitimate democratic device, like a demonstration or a protest march, which allows citizens to express their opposition to the policy of a private or public body. Thus, for example, various communities impose a variety of boycotts for such reasons as consumer and religious considerations, and reasons of conscience. Therefore, infringing the possibility of calling for a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, by means of imposing sanctions upon anyone who does so, infringes freedom of expression.\n\nAccording to the Petitioners, the Law also infringes the right to freedom of occupation. Sections 3 and 4 of the Law make it possible to exclude a person who calls for a boycott, or commits to participate in a boycott against the State of Israel, from participating in (public) tenders, as defined in the Mandatory Tenders Law, and also permit denying him various economic benefits. In so doing, the Petitioners argue, the Law infringes freedom of occupation.\n\nMoreover, according to the Petitioners, over the last few years there have been states and companies that have objected to the Government’s policy in the Area, and that refuse to do business with companies that operate there. As a result, companies that are interested in breaking into foreign markets, or to continue their overseas activities, may be required to declare that they do not manufacture or purchase goods from the Area, and that they do not operate there, and they should be permitted to make such declarations, as otherwise, their business and freedom of occupation will be harmed.\n\nThe Petitioners further argue that the Law also infringes the right to equality. The right to equality has also been recognized by the case law as deriving from the right to human dignity. The Petitioners argue that the Boycott Law does not oppose boycotts as such, but rather focuses only on those that call for a boycott of the State of Israel, its institutions, or activities conducted in “an area under its control”. According to the Petitioners, distinguishing between one boycott and another is unacceptable, and just as boycotts motivated by consumer or religious concerns, matters of conscience, and so forth are tolerated, the Law should similarly view those who call for boycotting the State of Israel, as defined by the Law. They argue that the provisions of the Law also potentially harm only certain sectors of society, due to their political beliefs. They further note in this regard that the fact that the European Union imposes economic sanctions upon activity in the Area, while Israel nevertheless continues its commercial, cultural and academic relations with EU members, constitutes a form of unequal treatment by the State in regard to citizens and residents of Israel who independently wish to call for a boycott of goods produced in the Area, as opposed to those who are required to do so by foreign governmental agencies, and whose acquiescence, with certain reservations, is not prohibited.\n\n11. As opposed to the Petitioners, the Respondents are divided in regard to the question of whether the law infringes the right to freedom of expression. The Attorneys for the Knesset expressed the opinion that while the Law indeed infringes the freedom of expression, that infringement is, in their opinion, proportionate (as will be explained below). As opposed to this, the representatives of the State Attorney’s Office are of the opinion, expressed before us by their attorney, that although the tortious liability that may be imposed by the Law indeed constitutes a certain degree of infringement of freedom of expression, the administrative restrictions to not pose such an infringement. The reason for this is related to the fact that, according to the Government’s approach, neither a citizen nor any other body has a vested right to enjoy various benefits that the state grants, and clearly, the Government has the right not to transfer funding that may be exploited for activities opposing its policy, or for harming third parties merely due to their connection to the state, one of its institutions, or an area under its control. In regard to the authority to restrict participation in tenders, the Government is of the opinion that although the principle of equality in the participation in tenders must be upheld, that principle is premised upon the obligation to ensure equal, fair distribution of the budgetary “pie”. Therefore, these restrictions should be examined in the same manner as the restriction of benefits under sec. 4 of the Law. The Government adds that the state’s choice not to grant funding to a particular body does not necessarily lead to an infringement of its freedom of expression or freedom of occupation, as its freedom to act in the manner it chose is not impaired (but only its possibility of obtaining public funding intended for given purposes that a governmental agncy wishes to promote).\n\nIn this context of the infringement of freedom of expression, the Respondents add that, actually, calling for and employing boycotts limit freedom of expression in light of their rationales. One of the purposes of the right to freedom of expression is the promotion of a “free marketplace of ideas”. In the opinion of the Respondents, calling for and participating in a boycott introduce economic considerations and constraints into that “marketplace of ideas”, and prevent it from functioning as a “free marketplace of ideas”.\n\nInsofar as the Petitioners’ claims in regard to the right to equality, the Respondents are of the opinion that the fact that the legislature saw fit to regulate a certain issue in legislation, believing that the matter required an appropriate legislative response (while leaving other issues without parallel regulation) does not give rise to a constitutional cause for annulling the Law by reason of an infringement of equality. They argue that the foundation of the right to equality, as recognized in the case law, is an infringement of “the autonomy of the individual will, freedom of choice, physical and intellectual integrity of the human being and the entirety of a person’s humanity”. In their opinion, the fact that there is no legislation that addresses matters that are similar or close to the boycotts that are precluded by the Law does not constitute such an infringement.\n\nB. Is the Law befitting the Values of the State of Israel and intended for a Proper Purpose?\n\n12. According to the Petitioners, the primary purpose of the Law is to prevent a boycott of the Area, to silence the expression of opposition to the Government’s policy, and thereby to intimidate only a particular side of the political map. The Petitioners further argued that the Law advances a punitive purpose that seeks to impose sanctions upon political speech on the basis of its content. In the opinion of the Petitioners, that purpose of the Law is improper in that it limits the democratic tools that a minority possesses for expressing its legitimate opposition to the settlements and the Government’s policy.\n\nAs opposed to this, the Respondents are of the opinion that the purpose of the Law is to protect the state (or Israeli institutions and entities) against the imposition of a boycott that might harm them merely because of their connection to the state, one of its institutions, or an area under its control. This is a proper purpose, in their view, in that it is an expression of the state’s obligation to protect the individuals and institutions connected to it, and to prevent discrimination against Israeli citizens on an illegitimate basis (such as their place of residence). Moreover, an additional purpose of the Law is to prevent harm to the international standing of Israel, or harm to its relations with other states and its foreign relations, which is also, in the Respondents’ view, a proper purpose.\n\nThe Legal Forum asked to add in this regard that the scope of the boycott phenomenon and calls for boycotts of Israel and its conduct, and the negative potential that inheres therein, is very significant, and for that reason, the enactment of the Law was necessary in order to prevent significant harm to the state and its citizens. In this regard, the Legal Forum pointed to many extreme publications by the BDS movement throughout the world that call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel, and for the rejection of the existence of the state. In the meantime, prior to the writing of this judgment, many books and articles have been published that treat of this phenomenon in various sectors that it affects, and its dangers for the State of Israel and its institutions. See: Cary Nelson & Gabriel Noah Brahm, eds., The Case against Academic Boycotts of Israel (2015) (hereinafter: The Case against Academic Boycotts); Ben-Dror Yemini, The Industry of Lies, especially pp. 271-290 (2014) (Hebrew); Amnon Rubinstein & Isaac Pasha, Sdakim Ba’academia (Academic Flaws: Freedom and Responsibility in Israeli Higher Education), especially pp. 117-132 (2014) (Hebrew) (hereinafter: Rubinstein & Pasha, Academic Flaws); Marc A. Greendorfer, The BDS Movement: That Which We Call a Foreign Boycott, By Any Other Name, Is Still Illegal (January 2015) (unpublished manuscript) (hereinafter: Greendorfer).\n\nC. The Proportionality Requirement\n\n13. The Petitioners are of the opinion that the Law does not meet the requirement of proportionality and its three subtests, as shall be detailed below.\n\n(1) The Rational Connection Test\n\n14. The Petitioners are of the opinion that the Law does not serve or further its declared purpose. According to them, the Boycott Law is entirely ineffective in the fight against the international boycott that motivates the Law’s initiators, and in practice, it may actually amplify the phenomenon of boycotts against Israel, as it will harm Israel’s image as a democratic state. The Petitioners add that they are of the opinion that the Law will also not lessen the number of people calling for a boycott of Israel, inasmuch as their motivations are ideological, and it is, therefore, unreasonable to imagine that the existence of the Law will cause them to refrain from calling for a boycott.\n\nAs opposed to this, the Respondents are of the opinion that there is a rational connection between the Law’s sanctions and the purpose that the Law seeks to serve. They argue that, on the one hand, the boycott tort and the administrative restrictions may remedy the economic harm, to the extent that it derives from a call to boycott, while on the other hand, they present those who call for boycott with a logical choice between that conduct and the full realization of their freedom of speech (knowing that it may cause harm to third parties), and their desire to enjoy various governmental benefits.\n\n(2) The Least Harmful Means Test\n\n15. The Petitioners are of the opinion that there are tools that could ensure the purpose of the Law even without exercising the means set out in the Law, for example, by means of establishing a system for compensating those who are harmed by the boycott from the public purse. The Petitioners further argue that already existing laws can be utilized to achieve the purposes that the Law’s initiators sought to promote. For example, in their opinion, a person harmed by the boycott can already directly sue someone who harms their business on the basis of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance [New Version] (hereinafter: the Civil Wrongs Ordinance). In their opinion, in regard to tenders, as well, specific conditions can be established in individual tenders that would prohibit the participation in boycotts against Israel, and therefore there is no need to employ primary legislation for this purpose.\n\nAs opposed to this, the Respondents argue that the Law meets the Least Harmful Means Test. According to them, the boycott tort does not normally enable a person to recover more than the actual damage caused to him by the person calling for a boycott (except in regard to damages under sec. 2(c) of the Law, which is limited by the requirement of “malice”, as will be explained below). In regard to the administrative restrictions, as well, the sanctions concern only the depriving of benefits (which do not constitute vested rights) from a person who calls for a boycott of the State of Israel, and therefore this would appear to be a reasonable infringement, under the circumstances, in regard to those who choose to act that manner.\n\n(3) The Proportionality Test “Stricto Sensu”\n\n16. In the opinion of the Petitioners, the interest that Israeli citizens and residents not call for boycotting the State of Israel and the boycotting of produce of the Area is not proportionate to the infringement of the fundamental rights of those who believe that the settlement enterprise in the Area is an impediment to peace and to the future of the State of Israel. The Petitioners further specifically emphasize, in regard to sec. 2(c) of the Law, that under the said section it is possible to impose punitive damages upon a person calling for a boycott even without proof of damage, contrary to the accepted principles grounding tort law.\n\nAs opposed to this, the Respondents argue that the Law meets the Proportionality Test stricto sensu, in view of “narrowing aspects” in the Law that limit the harm that it might cause to constitutional rights. In this regard, the Respondents refer to the following aspects:\n\na) The Law does not directly prevent political expression in regard to disputed political issues, but rather it concerns only a call for instituting a (economic, cultural, or academic) boycott against the State of Israel, as the term is defined by the Law, which alone is prohibited.\n\nb) The call for a boycott to which the Law applies must be public and done knowingly in order that liability for it be imposed in principle.\n\nc) The criminal sanction incorporated into the Law in its original version was deleted.\n\nd) The general principles of tort law apply, in principle, to an action under the boycott tort, including the “de minimus” proviso, the requirement of proof of damage, and a causal connection between the tort and the damage, as a precondition to obtaining a remedy.\n\ne) In regard to the boycott tort, imposing of damages without proof of damage is conditional upon a mental element of “malice”. Therefore, according to the Respondents, this section will only rarely be employed. According to the Respondents, the trial courts asked to award damages under this section will address the Law’s malice requirement.\n\nf) In regard to the administrative restrictions, the Law establishes a complex administrative process that involves several relevant actors who can oversee the manner of the exercise of discretion, and all of them are subject to the principles of administrative law.\n\nAdditional Arguments that were raised in general\n\n17. The Petitioners also argue that the Law is logically flawed. The reason for this is that, in practice, the Law establishes that a call for a boycott is, in their view, more serious than the boycott itself, inasmuch as while the Law imposes various sanctions upon a person who calls for a boycott, a person’s actual choice to institute a boycott (e.g., in regard to products produced in the Area) is not, in their opinion, deemed a tort in the eyes of the Law, and does not, in their view, lead to punitive or administrative sanctions.\n\nThe Respondents denied the logical flaw, but added that even if the Petitioners were correct, that would not give rise to a constitutional claim that would lead to the invalidity of the Law. The Government further argued before us that, at times, the call for a boycott may indeed be more serious than the boycott itself, due to the possible influence of the call for a boycott, which can exceed a particular person’s individual decision.\n\n18. The Legal Forum addressed the distinction that arose in some of the arguments of some of the Petitioners (to which the Government and the Knesset related, as well), by which – as an alternative to striking down the Law in its entirety – consideration should be given only to the erasure of the term “an area under its control” in sec. 1 of the Law. According to the Legal Forum, even if the term “an area under its control” in sec. 1 of the Law – defining a “boycott against the State of Israel” – were to be erased, that rejection might lead to boycotts against an entire community, and that would suffice to damage the purpose of the Law. Moreover, even if that term were erased, it would still be possible to justify any boycott against the State of Israel, or a community in Israel (such as the residents of the settlements, because they have a connection with the State of Israel).\n\n19. Additional arguments raised by the parties will be addressed in the course of the next chapter, as necessary. However, before proceeding, we should note that in the course of the proceedings, there was a request for an interim order (in the Ta’al Petition), which was denied on July 27, 2011 (in regard to the considerations for granting an interim order against a law in cases of constitutional review, see HCJ 1715/97 Israel Investment Managers Association v. Minister of Finance, IsrSC 51 (4) 367, 380-382 (1997) (hereinafter: the Investment Managers Association case).\n\nI shall now examine the case on the merits.\n\nDiscussion and Decision\n\n20. I will begin with a necessary observation. The examination that follows will not consider the wisdom of the Law (which was even questioned by some of the Government’s representatives, as noted in para. 3, above), but only its constitutionality. In this regard, we are guided by the words of President A. Barak in the Investment Managers Association case (ibid., p. 386), as follows:\n\nThe Court does not come to replace the legislature’s considerations with its own. The Court does not put itself in the shoes of the legislature. It does not ask itself what means it would have chosen if it had been a member of the legislative body. The Court performs judicial review. It examines the constitutionality of the law, not its wisdom. The question is not whether the law is good, effective or just. The question is whether it is constitutional [...] Establishing policy is the role of the legislature, and its realization is the role of the government, which are granted a margin of constitutional appreciation [emphasis added – H.M.].\n\nIn view of the above criteria, and having reviewed the copious material submitted to us, and heard the arguments of the attorneys of the parties, I have concluded that the Law can, for the most part, overcome the requirements of the “Limitation Clause” – although not easily – with the exception of sec. 2(c), which must be struck down, and so I shall recommend to my colleagues.\n\nMy reasons for the said conclusions will be set out in detail below. The discussion will proceed as follows: I shall first examine whether or not there is an infringement of a constitutional right, and show that the Law does, indeed, infringe the right to freedom of expression, as well as other constitutional rights. Following that, I will examine whether or not the various provisions of the Law meet the tests established by the “Limitation Clause”, while, inter alia, drawing upon comparative law. Finally, I will provide further support for my conclusion by reference to additional theories that have been developed in the field of constitutional law in regard to the invalidation of laws.\n\nI will now set out my examination from first to last.\n\nInfringement of a Constitutional Right\n\n21. From the language of the Law, presented above in para. 2, we learn that anyone who knowingly publishes a call for the imposition of a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, may be deemed to have committed a tort. Moreover, the participation of such a person, or one who has committed to participate in such a boycott in public tenders, may be restricted, and it is possible that such a person may be prevented from receiving various financial benefits (governmental grants, tax exemptions, state guarantees, etc.).\n\nThus we find that most of the sanctions imposed by the Law already apply at the speech stage.\n\nIt is, therefore, hard to deny that the Boycott Law indeed infringes freedom of expression (as argued by the Petitioners, and as Respondent admit, in part), which is “closely and materially bound to human dignity” (as stated by my colleague (then) Justice M. Naor in HCJ 10203/03 Hamifkad Haleumi Ltd. v. Attorney General, IsrSC 62 (4) 715, 763 (2008) [English: http://versa.cardozo.yu.edu/opinions/hamifkad-haleumi-v-attorney-general, at para. 26]; and see: Aharon Barak, Human Dignity: The Constitutional Value and its Daughter Rights, vol. 2, pp 708-712 (2014) (Hebrew), [published in English as Human Dignity: The Constitutional Value and the Constitutional Right (2015)] (hereinafter: Barak, Human Dignity), and the case-law cited there). However, we are not concerned here with an infringement of the core of freedom of expression, even where political speech is concerned, inasmuch as the infringement is relatively limited, and applies only to a call for a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, or anyone who commits to participate in such a boycott, which is a legal act that exceeds speech.\n\nHere we must pause for a moment to explain that the laws concerning calls for (and participation in) a boycott have undergone various incarnations in legal and political history. In the ancient world – both in Jewish law and in Greece – there was an institution of ostracism under which people who acted contrary to societal rules, or who were feared might undermine the social order, were ostracized (or, at times, exiled) (see Ha’encyclopedia Ha’ivrit, vol. 18, pp. 51-59, s.v. “Herem (nidui, schemata) bayahadut” (Hebrew); ibid., vol. 2, pp. 29-30, s.v. “Ostracism”; The Case Against Academic Boycotts, pp. 4-5). However, even early in those days, many began to sense that the institution of ostracism was problematic and harmful to democracy, and in this regard, the renowned Greek philosopher Plutarch (ca. 45-120 CE), in his monumental work Parallel Lives, tells the story of Aristides (a renowned Greek statesman at the beginning of the 5th cent. BCE, of whom Plato declared that “of all the great renowned men in the city of Athens, he was the only one worthy of consideration”). Aristides was called “the Just” in appreciation of his virtues, but Athenian society nevertheless voted to ostracize and exile him. When a common citizen in the crowd was asked why this was done, he replied that he was “tired of hearing him everywhere called the just”. (At the end of the story, Athenian society realizes its error and returns Aristides to the community and his status, see: Ha’encyclopedia Ha’ivrit, vol. 5, pp. 871-872, s.v. “Aristides” (Hebrew); The Case Against Academic Boycotts, pp. 4-5).\n\nSince then, and for centuries, religious and political thinking have expressed doubts in regard to ostracism (see, for example, in our sources: Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Mo’ed Katan 17a). Nonetheless, modern history has seen boycotts employed from time to time, as for example, in the American Revolution, when (on Dec. 16, 1773) the Boston Tea Party saw a cargo of imported tea thrown into the sea, followed by a boycott of various British goods by Americans who sought freedom and emancipation from England. However, the institution was only “officially” revived and given its “modern” name in the 19th century, following a strike of tenant farmers against Captain Charles Boycott in 1873. After his retirement from the army, Captain Boycott began a campaign to evict Irish tenant farmers from their farms due to their refusal to agree to a raise in rent. The response of the farmers and their supporters was expressed in a successful call to cut off all ties to Boycott, the other landowners, and their produce. The institution has since been called “boycott” in English. In time, criticism and doubts arose in regard to the institution of boycotts, and the 20th century saw the draawing of various distinctions between “permissible boycotts” (such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and Gandhi’s boycott of British goods), and “impermissible boycotts” that are prohibited by law. And see: Gary Minda, Boycott in America: How Imagination and Ideology shape the Legal Mind (1999), where the author notes (at p. 197):\n\n“Group boycotts may appear to some as acts of political terrorism.”\n\nThat statement is made even though, in the United States, boycotts against expressions of racism, or in the framework of labor disputes, are deemed permissible. See: NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers, 377 U.S. 288 (1964); and see: NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982) (hereinafter: the Claiborne case); also see: Yaniv Meno, “Consumer Boycotts, the Ethical Weapon of the Consumers,” 15 Hamishpat 729 (2010) (Hebrew); Nili Cohen, “Law, Play, Game - The ‘Merchant of Venice’ and the ‘Breakdown’,” 51 Hapraklit 407, 433-434 (2012) (Hebrew) http://www.hapraklit.co.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Nili_Cohen_Article.pdf).\n\n22. In light of the finding that we are faced with an infringement of freedom of expression, which is a “daughter right” of human dignity (to adopt the term coined by Prof. Barak in his book Human Dignity, ibid.), the sanctions in the Boycott Law constitute an infringement of a protected constitutional right. However, that constitutional right, like all other constitutional rights in Israel, is not absolute, but rather relative, and may be restricted if the infringement meets the requirements of the “Limitation Clause” in sec. 8 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (see: Aharon Barak, Proportionality in Law, 53 (2010) (Hebrew) (hereinafter: Barak, Proportionality in Law) [published in English as: Aharon Barak, Proportionality – Constitutional Rights and their Limitations, (Doron Kalir, trans.)]; HCJ 2194/06 Shinui- The Center Party v. the Chairman of the Central Elections Committee (2006) (published in Nevo) (hereinafter: the Shinui case); HCJ 236/13 Otzma Leyisrael v. Chairman of the Central Elections Committee for the 19th Knesset (2013) (published in Nevo)).\n\nI will, therefore, examine below whether the Boycott Law meets the requirements of the “Limitation Clause”. But before doing so, I would note that we are aware of many instances of legislative prohibitions that were recognized as valid, even though they infringed freedom of expression per se. I would note a few examples: the prohibition of defamation (under the Prohibition of Defamation Law, 5725-1965 [19 L.S.I. 254] , which establishes both a criminal offense and a civil tort); racial incitement (see: sec. 144B of the Penal Law, 5737-1977 (hereinafter: the Penal Law); incitement to terrorism (see: the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance, 5708-1948, and see: Dafna Barak-Erez & Dudi Zechariah, “Incitement to Terrorism and the Limits of Freedom of Expression: Between Direct and Indirect Limits,” 35 Iyunei Mishpat (2012) (Hebrew) (hereinafter: Barak-Erez & Zechariah); sedition (see; sec. 134 of the Penal Law. And see: Mordechai Kremnitzer and Liat Levanon-Morag, “Restricting the Freedom of Expression Due to Fear of Violence – On the Protected Value and Probability Tests in Crimes of Incitement to Sedition and Incitement to Violence in the Wake of the Kahane Case,” 7 Mishpat U’Mimshal 305 (2004) (Hebrew). A. Dorfman, “Freedom of Speech and the Economic Theory of Uncertainty”, 8 Mishpat U’Mimshal 313 (2005) (Hebrew). Barak, Human Dignity, pp. 737-738); procurement of prostitution (see: secs. 205B and 205C of the Penal Law); publications infringing a person’s privacy (see: sec. 2(11) of the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, and recently: CA 8854/11 Anonymous v. Anonymous (April 24, 2014) (published in Nevo); restrictions upon political campaign advertising (see: Elections (Means of Propaganda) Law, 5719-1959, and recently, HCJ 979/15 Yisrael Beiteinu Party v. Chairman of the Central Elections Committee for the 20th Knesset (Feb. 25, 2015) (published in Nevo), and note that this judgment is currently pending in a Further Hearing); offences concerning public services that explicitly include a threat or intimidation by ostracism (see sec. 161 of the Penal Law; as well as contempt of court (see: sec. 255 of the Penal Law), and insulting a civil servant (see: sec. 288 of the Penal Law. And see: Re’em Segev (under the supervision of Prof. Mordecai Kremnitzer), Freedom of Expression against Governmental Authorities, pp. 31-35 (2001) (Hebrew)).\n\nIt should be noted that some of the above provisions fall within the scope of the Validity of Laws provision under sec. 10 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. On the interpretation of that section, see: Aharon Barak, “Validity of Laws,” (to be published in the Beinisch Volume); FH 5698/11 State of Israel v. Mustafa Dirani (January 15, 2015) (published in Nevo) (hereinafter: the Dirani case). Moreover, the case law of this Court has approved restrictions imposed pursuant to expressions (that would be deemed to be within the scope of freedom of expression in the United States) that smacked of racism, even though the restriction had no express statutory support. See: HCJ 4646/08 Lavi v. Prime Minister (Oct. 12, 2008) (published in Nevo).\n\nThus we see that abstract “freedom of expression” is not the be-all and end-all. Against this background, this Court’s case law has, indeed, quoted with approval the words of United States Supreme Court Justice Brennan that “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open” (see: CA 723/74 Ha'aretz Daily Newspaper Ltd. v. Israel Electric Corporation, IsrSC 31 (2) 281, 296 (1997) per Shamgar J.) [English: http://versa.cardozo.yu.edu/opinions/haaretz-daily-newspaper-ltd-v-israel-electric-corporation]; and see: HCJ 399/85 Kahane v. Broadcasting Authority, IsrSC 41 (3) 255, 280 (1987) (hereinafter: the Kahane case). However, when it found that the infringement of the said freedom met all of the conditions of the “Limitation Clause” (including the requirement of proportionality) in circumstances in which permitting the expression “could undermine axiomatic foundations in a manner that might threaten the social and national fabric” (HCJ Bakri v. Israel Film Council, IsrSC 58 (1) 278, 249 (2003)), the Court held that the restriction would be approved (and compare: para. 9 of the opinion of Barak P. in the Shinui case).\n\n23. At this point we should note that even the case law of the Supreme Court of the United States – where the First Amendment to the Constitution grants particularly broad protection of freedom of expression – has created exceptions:\n\nFirst, everyone agrees that protection does not extend to a person falsely shouting “fire” in a packed theater, thus causing unnecessary panic, as Holmes J. stated in Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919):\n\nThe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.\n\nThese words have frequently been quoted in the past and were most recently referred to by my colleague Justice N. Hendel in LCrimA 2533/10 State of Israel v. Michael Ben Horin (Dec. 26, 2011) (published in Nevo). I would stress that this exception is somewhat artificial in that there is general consensus that falsely shouting fire in a theater may cause harm (and is therefore not protected), whereas the justification for calling for a boycott against the state is the subject of political debate. Nonetheless, along with this agreed exception, the United States – which is the most liberal in this field – has developed additional exceptions and new approaches, insofar as this has become necessary by changing times and needs. I will address these in para. 24A below, and further on.\n\n24. The constitutional examination that will be presented in my opinion will, as noted, focus on the legal aspects of the relevant provisions of the Law, and will also be aided by comparative law. However, several additional, basic premises underlying the examinations must be laid out:\n\n(a). It would seem that when expression does not solely concern an attempt to persuade the public in regard to facts, beliefs and worldviews, but also calls for action, we enter an area that goes beyond mere freedom of expression, and the matter also concerns, inter alia, the legality or morality of the referenced act (the boycott), its general context, and other considerations that balance the various interests concerned. Thus, a call to participate in a criminal act, or in a restrictive trade practice, or to breach a contract is generally prohibited (subject to exceptions). Therefore, we do not find a general law treating of boycott, or as Stevens J. stated in the United States Supreme Court decision in the Claiborne case, boycott is a concept that has a “chameleon-like” character that presents “elements of criminality and elements of majesty” (ibid., at p. 888). Thus, even in the United States, where freedom of expression enjoys primacy relative to other fundamental rights, sometimes a call for a boycott is permissible and deemed to fall within the scope of “freedom of speech” (see: the Claiborne case), and sometimes it is limited or prohibited, despite “freedom of speech” (and see: International Longshoremen's Association, AFL-CIO, v. Allied International, Inc., 456 U.S. 212 (1982); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010) (hereinafter: the Holder case); the latter two cases are closer to the material of the case at bar).\n\nThus, while almost every expression of opinion is permissible in a democratic state, and the same is true, in principle, in regard to demonstrations (subject to certain restrictions of public safety), a call for a boycott is context-contingent, and involves, inter alia, the “legality” of the said boycott. Thus, for example, a consumer boycott that serves consumer objectives is generally possible (but an “advertising boycott” that harms the freedom of the press is generally deemed to be prohibited, in addition to the antitrust aspects that may be involved), while a boycott for a political end is generally forbidden. (See: Gordon M. Orloff, “The Political Boycott: An Unprivileged Form of Expression,” 1983 Duke L. J. 1076 (1983) (hereinafter: Orloff, “The Political Boycott”); and see: CA 115/75 Israeli Association of Travel and Tourism Agents v. Kopel Tours Ltd., IsrSC 29 (2) 799 (1975).\n\nBecause the determination in regard to a boycott in the United States depends upon its type and circumstances, judicial review in this area is conducted from “the bottom up”, and is carried out as applied review rather than as facial review. On these distinctions and their consequences, see Ronen Polliack, “Relative Ripeness: As-Applied or Abstract Constitutional Judicial Review,” 37 (1) Iyunei Mishpat 45 (Feb., 2014), written following HCJ 3429/11 Alumni Association of the Arab Orthodox School in Haifa v. Minister of Finance, (Jan. 5, 2012) (published in Nevo) [English: http://versa.cardozo.yu.edu/opinions/alumni-association-arab-orthodox-school-haifa-v-minister-finance] (hereinafter: the Alumni Association case); and Elena Chachko, “On Ripeness and Constitutionality: HCJ 3429/11 Alumni Association of the Arab Orthodox School in Haifa v. Minister of Finance and HCJ 3803/11 Israeli Capital Markets Trustees Association v. State of Israel,” 43 Mishpatim 419 (2013) (hereinafter: Chachko, “On Ripeness and Constitutionality”) (for a detailed discussion of the ripeness doctrine in the context of our discussion, see para. 60, below).\n\n(b). In regard to the issues that are the subject of the petitions at bar, the Law defines itself – even by its name – as intended to prevent harm to the State of Israel by means of a boycott. We thus find that we must assume as a basic fact that the Knesset chose to enact legislation to aid in the state’s battle against those who seek to ostracize it and its residents.\n\n(c). It would appear that both the legislature and the Petitioners (with the exception of the Petitioners in the Barkai Petition), as well as the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement, which acts against Israel, make no distinction between the State of Israel and its institutions, and areas under the control of the state. In calling for such a boycott, those addressed are asked to refrain from any economic, cultural, or academic connection with a person or other body solely due to their connection to the State of Israel or its institutions, or to areas under its control, and not due to their conduct.\n\nAs noted, we addressed questions in this regard to the parties in the course of the hearing. Some of the attorneys for the Petitioners replied that even if the settlements (which are currently the focus of the calls for boycott) did not exist, it would still be permissible, in their opinion, to call for a boycott of the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, as long as Israel continues to conduct itself in a manner that they view as discriminating against the Arab minority, or does not change its character (as a Jewish state). True to this approach, some of the attorneys of the Petitioners informed us that they believe that it would have been permissible (even prior to the peace accords with Egypt and Jordan, and the “Paris Protocol” with the Palestinian representatives) to call for participation in the Arab League’s economic boycott against Israel – a boycott that, at the time, inflicted significant economic harm to the State of Israel and its residents when many international companies refused to trade with Israel, or conduct business in Israel. According to this view, the same legal approach should apply both to the current situation, in which, in the opinion of the Petitioners, it is permissible to encourage participation in boycotts against Israel, even in the future, and even if an arrangement for coexistence is achieved between Israel and its neighbors, as long as all the other “claims” that they see as justifying the call for a boycott continue to exist.\n\nAt this juncture, we should recall that the State of Israel was rescued from the said “Arab Boycott”, inter alia, thanks to specific American and European legislation that prohibited participation in the boycott, or submission to it – legislation that remains in effect in those countries (for the details of that legislation, see the surveys prepared by the Knesset Research and Information Center that were presented to the Constitution Committee http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02861.pdf (Hebrew); and see: Greendorfer in regard to the current situation in the United States. The U.S. legislation that prohibited cooperation with the Arab Boycott was not found to be repugnant to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, see: Briggs & Stratton Corporation v. Baldridge, 782 F.2d 915 (7th Cir. 1984); The Trane Company v. Baldridge, 552 F. Supp. 1378 (W. Dist. Wisc. 1983). On the situation in Europe, see below, para. 49ff.).\n\n25. As we see from the above, a call for participation in the boycott against the State of Israel, as defined in the Law, organized by various actors in the United States, Europe, or Israel constitutes encouragement to participate in an unlawful act, or conduct that comprises prohibited elements of discrimination, impermissible intervention in contractual relations, or even restrictive trade practices (all in accordance with the relevant law), regarding which, in principle, liability can already be imposed under the existing law. Nevertheless, the Knesset was of the opinion that it would be appropriate to provide a more tightly defined normative framework for the said wrongful conduct, and therefore three principles were established under sec. 2 of the Law:\n\n(a) Publishing a call for imposing a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, and subject to the conditions set out in sec. 2(a) of the Law, constitutes a tort (sec. 2(a) of the Law).\n\n(b) In regard to sec. 62(a) of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance, a person who causes a breach of a legally binding contract by calling for a boycott against the State of Israel will not be deemed to have acted with sufficient justification (sec. 2(b) of the Law).\n\n(c) Under sec. 2(c) of the Law, the court may impose damages that are not contingent upon proof of damage (hereinafter: exemplary damages) upon anyone who commits a tort, as defined by the Law.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Law establishes that, in the context of secs. 3-4, the Minister of Finance is granted the authority – subject to the conditions stated therein – to restrict the participation in a tender (in accordance with the Mandatory Tenders Law), or to withhold economic benefits as defined in sec. 4 of the Law, in regard to anyone who publishes a call for the imposition of a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, or who commits to participate in such a boycott.\n\nI must now examine whether or not the said provisions meet the conditions of the “Limitation Clause”. I will put the cart before the horse and state that, in my opinion, secs. 2(a), 2(b), 3 and 4 of the Law can successfully overcome the constitutional “Limitation Clause”, whereas sec. 2(c) of the Law fails the required tests.\n\nI will now explain this in orderly detail, but before embarking, I would note that having expressed the view that there is an infringement of freedom of expression, there is no need for a separate examination of the Petitioners’ claims in regard to infringement of freedom of occupation and other constitutional rights, inasmuch as all of those infringements in this case derive from the infringement of freedom of expression, and if that infringement meets the criteria of the “Limitation Clause”, then the same holds for the other infringements. See: HCJ 6427/02 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. The Knesset, IsrSC 61 (1) 619, 674-675 (2006) per Barak P., pursuant to HCJ 4676/94 Meatrael Ltd. v. Knesset, IsrSC 50 (5) 206 (1998).\n\nExamining the Provisions of the Law under the “Limitation Clause”\n\n26. Section 8 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty provides as follows, in what is commonly referred to as the “Limitation Clause”:\n\nViolation of Rights\n\nThere shall be no violation of rights under this Basic Law except by a law befitting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required.\n\nI will, therefore, examine the provisions of the Law in terms of the conditions of the Limitation Clause.\n\n27. The first condition established by the Limitation Clause requires that the violation of a constitutional right “under this Basic Law” be implemented by a law (or by virtue of express authorization in such a law). This condition is met in the case before us, as the sanctions established under secs. 2-4 of the Boycott Law are established in a statute enacted by the Knesset.\n\n28. The second condition established by the Limitation Clause requires that the law befit the values of the State of Israel. This clause has been interpreted as pointing, first and foremost, to the values of the State of Israel as a “Jewish and democratic state”, which must be upheld in the spirit of the principles set forth in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, as stated in sec. 1 and 1A of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. Other fundamental values of the State of Israel may also be considered within this framework.\n\nThere is tension between the positions of the Petitioners and the Respondents in regard to whether this condition is met. The Petitioners are of the opinion that the Law infringes freedom of expression and detracts from the democratic character of the state. The Respondents, who justify the Law, argue that the Law falls within the scope of the state’s need to defend itself against those who would seek to destroy it, or those who seek to change its character, and it is thus an implement that a “defensive democracy” must have in its “tool box”. Moreover, the Law is intended to prevent discrimination against the citizens of the State of Israel, whether due to their national identity or due to their residence in areas under the control of the state. This disagreement will be examined below, and I shall try to provide answers to the said question in that framework.\n\n29. The “defensive democracy” doctrine was recognized – in a majority opinion – in EA 1/65 Yeredor v. Chairman of the Central Elections Committee for the Sixth Knesset, IsrSC 19 (3) 365, although at the time, that approach did not have any express statutory underpinning (and see: Amnon Rubinstein & Barak Medina, The Constitutional Law of the State of Israel, vol. 2, (6th ed., 2005) pp. 588-591, 604-618). That doctrine must be effected in accordance with the conditions of each state and its residents (see: Jan-Werner Muller, “A ‘Practical Dilemma Which Philosophy Alone Cannot Resolve’? Rethinking Militant Democracy: An Introduction,” 19 Int’l J Crit.Dem.Theory (2012) (hereinafter: Muller, “Militant Democracy”); and see: Svetlana Tyulkina, Militant Democracy (2015)). Accordingly, this approach was adopted through the recognition of Israel as a “Jewish and democratic state”, and this basic constitutional element was recognized and given expression in the Basic Laws enacted since 1992, as well as in the sub-constitutional normative area (for a list of all the relevant legal provisions, see: Hanan Melcer, “The IDF as the Army of a Jewish and Democratic State,” in Rubinstein Volume (2014) pp. 347, 349-351). In this regard, we must take note that in the Boycott Law the legislature expressed its intent that the Law’s provisions were meant to prevent harm to the state of Israel by means of boycott, and thus, on its face, and on the basis of the presumption of constitutionality of the Law, it would appear that the Law falls within the scope of the “defensive democracy” doctrine (and moreover, some of the Petitioners declared, as noted, that in their opinion it is indeed legitimate to call for a boycott as long as the character of the state remains unchanged). On the consequences of the “defensive democracy” doctrine, see my opinion in the Dirani case, and see: G.H. Fox & G. Nolte, “Intolerant Democracies,” 36 Harv. Int. L. J. (1995); Barak Medina, “Forty Years to the Yeredor Decision: The Right to Political Participation,” 22 Mehkerey Mishpat (Bar-Ilan University Law Review) 327-383 (2006) [Hebrew] (hereinafter: Medina, “Forty Years to the Yeredor Decision”) which mentions the decision (although the author criticizes it), stating:\n\nOn the basis of the principle regarding “defensive democracy”, it is possible to justify governmental restrictions upon elements that seek to harm important interests recognized as fundamental rights [of third parties – H.C.], even if those elements are committed to non-violent methods in this regard. [But it is questionable whether this comprises calls for boycott, as I shall explain below – H.M].\n\n30. Moreover, it would appear that a call for a boycott deviates from pure freedom of expression. Thus, for example, as Justice A. Barak wrote in regard to the purposes of freedom of expression in the Kahane case:\n\nThe justification for freedom of expression is complex and intertwined. It is the individual’s right to realize himself, to form a worldview and an opinion by giving flight to his spirit, creative and receptive. It is the freedom of the individual and the community to illuminate the truth through a free and unending struggle between truth and falsity. It is the freedom of society’s members to exchange opinions and views in a spirit of tolerance, without fear, with respect for the autonomy of every individual, and to persuade one another in order to strengthen, secure and develop the democratic regime [ibid., p. 272 – emphasis added – H.M.].\n\nFreedom of expression is thus intended, inter alia, to enhance public discourse and to present even unaccepted views, so that society’s political decisions will be made freely and intelligently, through persuasion, with tolerance, and with respect for the autonomy of the other.\n\nThus, calls for a boycott against the State of Israel, as defined by the Law, do not serve the classical purpose of freedom of expression. As opposed to the view of the Petitioners, according to which calls for boycott advance “open and enhanced political discourse”, such calls are not actually interested in political decisions on the basis of free will, but seek to impose views by means of economic and other means (in the field of contracts, as well, influence by means of economic coercion has been recognized in the law and the case law as contrary to free will, and thus gives rise to a cause for rescission of the contract (see: sec. 17 of the Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733-1973; CA 8/88 Shaul Rahamin Ltd., v. Expomedia Ltd., IsrSC 43 (4) 95, 100-101 (1989); CA 1569/93 Maya v. Panford (Israel) Ltd., IsrSC 48 (5) 705, 706 (1994); and cf. Daniel Friedman & Nili Cohen, Contracts, vol. 2, 965 (1992), who include in the scope of coercion: “also threats of ‘boycott’ or ‘blacklisting’, whose significance is that suppliers will refrain from transacting with a person, or that customers will refrain from transacting with him, or that other employers will refuse to employ him”, and conclude: “In this area , as well, it is conceivable that the threat, if not made in order to protect a justified interest, may constitute coercion”).\n\nThis approach of calling for economic, academic and cultural boycott does not, therefore, serve democracy, but rather harms it, as I shall explain:\n\n(A) The Petitioners argue that the Boycott Law violates their freedom to conduct political discourse, but in this regard it would be proper to delineate the distinction between freedom of expression as a means of persuasion, which is a cornerstone of a democratic state, and freedom of expression as a means of coercion, which undermines the values of a democratic state. Whereas in order to advance freedom of thought and opinion, a democratic state will seek to encourage a free marketplace of ideas through freedom of expression, when that freedom is employed (by way of calling for boycotts) as a means for violating the right of the individual to choose on the basis of his opinions and beliefs, the protection granted to freedom of expression can be somewhat restricted. See: Orloff, “The Political Boycott” (ibid., pp. 1076-1077):\n\nA political boycott is a coercive mode of expression that, regardless of its goals, deprives its victims of their freedom to speak and to associate as they please… A political boycott uses economic coercion to force its victims to speak or act politically in a way that furthers the goals, not necessarily of the speaker, but of the boycotter.\n\nThus, a call for boycott falls within the category referred to in constitutional literature as “the democratic paradox”, in which it is permissible to limit the rights of those who seek to benefit from democracy in order to harm it (see: EDA 11280/02 Central Elections Committee for the Sixteenth Knesset v. Tibi, IsrSC 57 (4) 1, 14-18 (2003), per Barak P.). Calling for or participating in a boycott may thus, at times, smack of “political terrorism”.\n\nThis view can be compared to the provisions of sec. 122 of the Knesset Elections [Consolidated Version] Law, 5729-1969:\n\n122. The following shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of five years or to a fine of IL 20,000:\n\n(1) a person who gives or offers a bribe for the purpose of inducing a voter to vote or to refrain from voting, whether generally or for a particular candidates’ list;\n\n…\n\n(3) a person who threatens a voter with inflicting harm on him or any other person if such voter votes or refrains from voting, whether generally or for a particular candidates’ list;\n\n…\n\n(6) a person who procures a person to vote or refrain from voting, whether generally or for a particular candidates’ list, by means of an oath, a curse, shunning, ostracism [Hebrew: “ḥerem”],[1] a vow, releasing from a vow, a promise to bestow a blessing, or giving an amulet; for the purpose of this section, “amulet” includes any object that some members of the public believe can cause benefit or harm to a person [emphasis added – H.M.].\n\nIn explaining the purpose of this law, Justice M. Cheshin wrote as follows:\n\nThe purpose of the law is that voters decide for themselves for whom to vote and for whom not to vote, after free and informed consideration of whom they believe worthy of their vote…the purpose of the law is to prevent the improper phenomenon of people voting or refraining from voting for a party or candidate for prime minister while under the influence of extraneous or other improper considerations [EA 11/01 Pines-Paz v. Shas, IsrSC 55 (3) 168 (2001); emphasis added – H.M.].\n\n(B) The above is of special concern in regard to the boycotting of Israeli academia. Such a call for the boycotting of the Israeli academic community, or of Israeli lecturers, undermines academic freedom itself and prevents research and instruction whose purpose, inter alia, is the search for truth. It is, in effect, a boycott of intellectualism itself, as boycott silences the discourse. Therefore, the Law that prohibits such activity is appropriate to the values of the State of Israel that, inter alia, ensure full academic freedom and advance research and excellence, which underlie Israel’s qualitative advantages. See: Rubinstein & Pasha, Academic Flaws, pp. 117-119.\n\n31. All of the above arguments can suffice to show that the Law meets the second condition of the Limitation Clause, and also shed light upon the third condition, which I shall now address.\n\n32. The third condition established by the Limitation Clause requires that the law under which a protected right is infringed serve a proper purpose. It would appear that the Law before us also meets this condition, which in our context also somewhat overlaps the second condition (and therefore, to the extent that the matters are shared, I will not repeat them).\n\nAs explained in paras. 28-30 above, the Law (without addressing the issue of the wisdom of its enactment) serves purposes that can be explained on the basis of the values of the state, and it is even intended to serve a number of specific purposes that can be viewed as legitimate:\n\nIt is intended to prevent harm by means of boycott to the State of Israel, as these terms are defined by the Law.\n\nIt delineates what is permitted and forbidden within the framework of freedom of expression, viz: it is permissible to express any political opinion and to attempt to persuade; it is permissib"
