        "text": "Raymond Danker\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Raymond DANKER & I would like get more info on my surname.\n\nI live in Malaysia & have docs of my family up to 4 generation over\n\nhere. There are many Danker in Malaysia especially in the Portuguese\n\nSettlement. According to your website there are many Danker surname\n\nfound especially in eastern Europe.\n\nI would really like to know if Danker are of Jewish decedents.\n\nI look forward to receiving some good news soon.\n\nRaymond Danker\n\nMelaka\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe DANKERs in Ireland are Jewish with ancestors >from Dvinsk (aka\n\nDaugapils and Dunaberg in Latvia. Zavel Danker moved to take a\n\nposition as Postmaster of Dankere (also called Gostini and Glazmanka)\n\n, hence the surname in this instance. Conditions in Dankere were\n\ndifficult for Jews in the 1880s and the family emigrated to England\n\nand later some of them came to Ireland. Information >from Annette\n\nDanker Steiner who did much research on her family background.\n\nI have also come across a Danker family in the US who arent Jewish and\n\nare not aware of any Jewish ancestry, only German ancestry. The\n\nsurname can have various origins. (It sounds Dutch to me)\n\nPhilippa Robinson"
