        "text": "Despite the suicide attacks on trendy hangouts like Cafe Moment, Cafe Rimon and Cafit, Israeli intellectuals still frequent Jerusalem's cafes. Conversations still linger late into the night over espresso, served Italian-style with a small glass of soda. But the atmosphere has changed. Now many of these late-night heart-to-hearts are between lifelong members of Peace Now, the vanguard of the Israeli peace movement, and veteran supporters of the West Bank settlement movement -- people who were, until recently, bitterly divided strangers.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, we have known an Israel whose political, cultural and social life was dominated by the eternal struggle between these two powerful ideological extremes: one that wanted to cover the West Bank with Jewish settlements, and one that urged recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a Palestinian state.\n\nBut the 1993 Oslo agreement had an effect no one intended: It destroyed that Israel forever. By withdrawing Israeli authority from the Arab population centers of the West Bank, Oslo made the ideology of the old Israeli right irrelevant; in bringing the carnage of Lebanon to the pedestrian malls of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, it demolished the ideology of the old Israeli left, which held that giving the P.L.O. authority over the West Bank would bring Israel peace and security. Now, for the first time in a genera tion, most Israelis are at neither pole. Instead, they find themselves uniting with former adversaries in the center of the old political spectrum.\n\nAmong those who represent this new center is Amnon Dankner, editor of Ma'ariv and for decades an icon of the Israeli peace movement. The Oslo process showed ''blindness, self-deception, arrogance and a denial of reality,'' he now says. ''All the brilliant minds of Oslo have not succeeded in squeezing the water of genuine acceptance of Israel out of the Palestinian stone.''\n\nAnother writer of the new center is Ari Shavit, a Ha'aretz journalist and one of the founders of Peace Now. After the acceleration of Palestinian terror operations in September 2000, Mr. Shavit wrote sharply against ''the conception that held that flooding the country with 50,000 Palestinian Kalashnikovs would bring peace to the Middle East,'' which he said ''has brought Israel to the edge of the abyss.''\n\nNo one doubts the reason for this reassessment. Israeli casualties at the hands of Palestinian terrorists since the Oslo agreement amount to 774 dead and 10 times as many wounded -- numbers that dwarf anything Israel has ever known. At the height of Yasir Arafat's terror-state in Lebanon from 1970 to 1982 (the years of the Munich and Ma'alot massacres and the Entebbe raid), Palestinian terrorists claimed only 162 Israeli lives. In the last 18 months alone, terrorists have taken 469 Israeli lives. Virtually everyone in Israel knows someone killed or maimed in the attacks. In my case it was my next-door neighbor in Jerusalem, a young businessman named Gadi Rejwan, slain by a Tanzim gunman.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
