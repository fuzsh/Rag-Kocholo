        "text": "After 35 years of preoccupation with the external threat from Arab armies, Israel is now awakening to new dangers from within: the perils of poverty, discrimination and ethnic tension among Jews themselves.\n\nThe country's 3.5 million Jews are becoming deeply divided along the lines of ethnic background, income, education and cultural heritage. The situation has led to a social gap, as Israelis have come to call it, which cuts severely into the cohesiveness with which the country once faced a common enemy outside.\n\nThe ethnic conflict is mixed intricately into poverty and politics. Sephardim and Ashkenazim\n\nThe Jews of Asian and North African origins, known as Sephardim or Orientals, now constitute a majority of Israel's population, and they dominate both the lower socio-economic levels of the society and the electoral constituency of Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\nThe upper ranks of education and income are occupied mostly by Ashkenazim, Jews of European and American lineage.\n\nBetween them lies a gulf of mutual misunderstanding, and often bigotry.\n\nThe tensions, smoldering for many years, have flared recently, with searing, racist statements heard from both sides. But although virulent hatred is expressed by only a few in each camp, some Israelis have begun to speak worriedly of the specter of civil war. It is an exaggeration, but one that underscores the intensity of the emotions.\n\n''I'm concerned,'' President Yitzhak Navon said recently, ''because the dangers we are facing inside are more serious than the external threat. We're now at a crossroads. Either the situation will escalate and we will go down into an abyss, or we will stop.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
