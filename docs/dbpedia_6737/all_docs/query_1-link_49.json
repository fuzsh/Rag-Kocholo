His attention to detail and expert advice has enabled me to sell my apartment after countless attempts through other brokers and agencies, with Oren it was swift and without any difficulties. His understanding of the marketplace is excellent and his ability to find the right buyer is his expertise. I would certainly tell my friends/family members to seek out Oren Cohen if they are either looking to buy or sell a property in Jerusalem.”\n\n“I have known and worked closely with Oren Cohen for close to 20 years. I highly recommend him, not only as a professional realtor, but also as a close and reliable friend who assisted me, my family, and my close friends throughout the years, in numerous transactions, with integrity and grace. It is truly an honor and privilege to have collaborated with Oren and hope to continue to do so for many years to come.”\n\n“I have had the privilege to work with Oren Cohen, a reliable, experienced, and trustworthy realtor, who has accompanied me, as well as my family members and colleagues, throughout the years, in a wide range of investments and sales. Oren is a loyal and professional individual, who displays a sense of security and stability to all those surrounding him and I look forward to a continued collaboration with Oren in the future.”\n\nDear Oren,\n\nI don’t have enough words to thank you for the success in selling my house in the German colony in Jerusalem. I asked you to try to sell the apartment over a year ago, during a difficult time of the corona pandemic and feeling insecure about the future.\n\nDespite the difficulties, you managed to bring the sale to a very successful conclusion and at an exceptional price. The entire sales process was carried out with exceptional professionalism, in a good atmosphere of sharing and with great patience. And indeed, you succeeded.\n\nAgain, many thanks and good luck in the future,\n\n“Dear Oren, on behalf of my wife and I , we would like to take this opportunity to tell you what a pleasant experience it dealing with you. You found the perfect home for us. Over the years we have been blessed with purchasing many properties. As I’m sure you know it’s not always clear sailing . Dealing with you has been so simple , honest, stress free as you handled every aspect of our purchase . We cannot express in words the thanks that we have to you. May you be blessed with good health and continued success in all your endeavors.”\n\n“It is my pleasure to recommend Oren as a real estate agent for any client searching for the ideal pied-a-terre or home in Jerusalem. Not only is he a master at negotiating contracts (nothing escapes his attention), I can attest to his extremely honest and professional service. As an interior designer working in Jerusalem who is involved with clients at the outset,I have personally witnessed how Oren continues to accompany and help clients way after contracts have been signed. He is highly personable, attentive and if you are looking for a smooth stress-free home-buying experience then do not hesitate to contact Oren.”\n\n“If there was ever a real estate agent that puts the client before his commission, it is Oren Cohen. Oren is well known and highly respected for his in-depth knowledge of the Jerusalem and surrounding real estate market. If there is a property that is available before it is on the market, Oren knows it first. What truly sets him apart in his industry is his superlative customer service and client focused approach. Oren’s goal has always been to foster and create relationships with his clients that don’t end with the purchase or sale of a property. He gives service with a heart and most of his clients become close life-long friends.\n\nOren’s patience and positive attitude are invaluable. He never pushes but lets the buyer steer the ship and make the final decision. He is available at all hours of the day and night, making sure his client’s needs are met in every aspect of Israeli life. If he can’t do something, he knows someone who can. Oren has built a tremendous network of professionals that was forged through hard work and earned trust. His team is able to provide support, feedback, insight, resources and information that make the process of buying a property in Israel less daunting and help fulfill a life-long dream.”\n\nDear Oren,\n\nI don’t have enough words to thank you for the success in selling my house in the German colony in Jerusalem.
