        "text": "I have been reporting on Israel since before its Declaration of Independence in 1948. This is a nation that purportedly entitles everyone within its borders to freedom of the press; the Palestinian Authority certainly exercises that freedom.\n\nAnd as a longtime supporter of the need for a Jewish state, I continually find that my most reliable source of news from Israel is The New York Times’ Ethan Bronner — especially now, as the very existence of Israel is increasingly threatened by Iran, Hamas and other sworn enemies.\n\nA model of analytical investigative journalism, Bronner is without bias, for or against Israel. In a recent report (‘Israel TV Station’s Troubles Reflect a Larger Political Battleground,’ Dec. 26), he tells how Channel 10 — a television station regarded by many in Israel as playing a ‘vital role in public debate’ because of its investigative independence — ‘infuriated’ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife over ‘reports of lavish travel.’\n\nAccording to Bronner, Channel 10 reported that Netanyahu and his wife ‘flew first class and stayed in baronial hotel suites’ before he became prime minister in 2009, ‘when he was a member of Parliament and as finance minister.’ Furthermore, Bronner writes, the travel was ‘paid for by wealthy friends.’\n\nNetanyahu has not been Channel 10’s only target. As Bronner notes, ‘the channel also angered previous leaders, playing a key role in exposing the way the 2006 Lebanon war was conducted and publicizing suspicions of corrupt land deals in the family of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.’\n\nAs I write this, Bronner reports that ‘Channel 10 is … fighting for its life.’ Not because Netanyahu ‘filed a million-dollar libel suit against the station’ for the channel’s disclosure of his travels, but as a result of his government’s refusal to ‘postpone the station’s debt,’ even though that had been allowed before. This ‘could force it to close.’ Was that Netanyahu’s revenge?\n\nIsrael’s president, Shimon Peres, a member of the opposition liberal-centrist Kadima party, calls the station’s possible closure ‘a struggle for Israel’s democratic character.’\n\nMoreover, to provide a sense of further divisions in Israel on freedom of expression, Bronner writes that President Peres ‘also declared himself ‘ashamed’ of several bills being considered in Parliament that he believes chip away at democracy in Israel: an anti-defamation law, one that silences loudspeakers issuing the Muslim call to prayer and another that prevents foreign governments from financing left-wing Israeli groups.’\n\nOnly ‘left-wing’ groups? That sounds like Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis account of the extent to which some members of the press are less free in Israel gets more complex as Bronner, who digs deeper into each extended story he covers, adds: ‘In previous years … Netanyahu actually intervened to save Channel 10 twice because, he said, he favors increasing broadcast outlets to expand the marketplace of ideas and debate.’\n\nBut now, ‘the Israeli news media, (Netanyahu) and his aides complain, lean to the left and what the country needs is an Israeli version of Fox News.’ If this were indeed what they wished for, would the Netanyahu coalition then give Kadima and other liberal critics equal time to be ‘fair and balanced’?\n\nFurthermore, would it be the particular administration in power that would ultimately define what is ‘fair and balanced’? In view of the current government onslaught of Cannel 10, I doubt that there’d be a significant expansion of ‘the marketplace of ideas and debate’ in a Fox News-like climate.\n\nNor am I optimistic that a government led by Kadima and other passionate critics of Netanyahu would necessarily countenance the press freedom that Israel allowed when I was reporting from there in the 1980s. In addition to interviewing a political range of Israelis, including journalists, I spent time with decidedly outspoken Palestinian nationalists in Ramallah and East Jerusalem.\n\nIn Ramallah, a couple of the Palestinian activists wanted to know a lot about me before they began a real conversation. I guess I passed muster because they bristled while detailing their versions of rank injustices under ‘occupation.’ And Israelis of all alliances spoke freely.\n\nCurrently however, veteran Israeli journalist Amnon Dankner, former editor of the newspaper Maariv, tells Bronner: ‘For the first time, I feel the end of critical and investigative news as we have known it in Israel. If Channel 10 closes, Channel 2 (also an independent channel) will grow tamer. Since childhood I have felt that freedom of the press was marching forward here. Now I feel it is retreating.’\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has a different take. The day after the Bronner story, the Times’ Isabel Kershner reported this declaration by the prime minister: ‘Israel is a democratic, Western, liberal state … the public sphere in Israel will be open and safe for all’ (‘Israeli Girl, 8, at Center of Tension Over Religious Extremism,’ Dec. 27).\n\nSo, will Channel 10 stay on the air? And what about those other decidedly restrictive laws being considered in Parliament? Which Netanyahu are we to believe?\n\nI write this column as a non-religious Jew deeply concerned that Israel continue and sustain its identity rooted in the freedom to openly dispute whatever government is in power.\n\nThe Zionist Organization of America may or may not disagree with much of what I have written here, but I do agree with ZOA that ‘the danger to Israel (from its enemies) is greater now than it has ever been.’\n\nThe freer that nation is, the stronger it will be against those who would destroy it.\n\nThis is also true of my country. More Americans are insisting on countering the anti-freedom Patriot Act and the preventive detention measures that the Bush-Cheney and Obama administrations have imposed on our nation’s identity.\n\nHow will we allow our identity to be defined by our next president and Congress?\n\nNat Hentoff is a nationally renowned authority on the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights. He is a member of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Cato Institute, where he is a senior fellow."
