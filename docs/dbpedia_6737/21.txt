Renowned writer Amnon Dankner passed away Friday at the age of 67.

Dankner was born in Jerusalem in 1946 and though his parents were secular, he attended a religious school.

As an undergraduate student of Law, he served as the spokesman of the Education Ministry and later as the spokesman of the Jewish Agency.

In 1976, he started his journalism career as a reporter for Haaretz, and later wrote for Davar and Hadashot. In 1997 he started working for Maariv and was appointed editor in chief in 2001.

Dankner wrote many books and appeared as a commentator in political television shows.

As a close friend of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who last year was exonerated of the majority of the corruption charges brought against, Dankner fiercely criticized the state prosecutor: "After this ruling, the state prosecutor should do more than just consider resigning – he should consider suicide."

Elaborating on the startling statement, Dankner said that, "What Lador did – he effectively overthrew the government. He caused a prime minister to resign, he changed the lived of millions of Israelis – for the worst, in my opinion – and he did it in a shameful way."
