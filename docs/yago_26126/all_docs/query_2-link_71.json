Attempts at reconciliation by the families were unsuccessful and their marriage was dissolved by the Bavarian Supreme Court on 17 January 1913.\n\nPerhaps snubbing of Isabelle by the Bavarian Royal family also had a bearing on the quick dissolvement of their marriage.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Pope also issued a decree to dissolve the marriage.\n\nIn 1919 Georg resigned his military career and began studying theology and was ordained a Catholic priest on 19 March 1921.\n\nPrince George possibly saved the life of Consignor Smit, Titular Archbishop of Paralus who had been accosted by a woman with a revolver. 18.1524 Prince Konrad of Bavaria 1883 1969 Princess Bona Margherita of Savoy (Italy) 1896 1971 See 8.223 18.15241 Princess Amalie Isabella of Bavaria 1921 1985 Umberto Poletti 1921 1995 18.15242 Prince Eugen Leopold of Bavaria 1925 1997 Countess Helene von Khevenhüller-Metsch 1921 2017 See 32.84134 - Helene was firstly married to Prince Konstantin of Bavaria 18.153 Princess Theresa of Bavaria 1850 1925 18.154 Prince Franz Joseph \"Arnulf\"of Bavaria 1852 1907 Princess Therese of Liechtenstein 1850 1938 Therese was a sister of Prince Alfred Aloys of Liechtenstein 18.1541 Prince Heinrich Luitpold of Bavaria 1884 1916 Heinrich was killed in action in Monte Sule, Transylvania\n\nWas he the intended husband for Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde of Luxembourg? 18.16 Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria 1823 1914 Archduke Francis of Austria-Este (Duke Francis V of Modena) 1819 1875 See 47.52 - In 1859 the people of Modena voted for union with Savoy and in the following year Francis was deposed. This line died out with the death of Archduke Francis. Francis succeeded his mother Princess Maria Beatrice of Sardinia (wife of Duke Francis IV of Modena) as Heir-Gen of Charles I, King of England (i.e. heir to the Jacobite claim to the throne of Great Britain). Francis was succeeded by his niece Archduchess Marie Theresa of Austria-Este (Modena Line) as Jacobite claimant.

He renounced his rights to the Bavarian throne on 29 June 1914 although he was granted permission on 3 August 1914 to continue ad persona the right, title and rank of Prince of Bavaria. His children were born Prince/Princess of Bavaria but were raised to Infante/Infanta of Spain when they were born. Maria Theresa died from an embolism (formation of a blood clot) just one week after the birth of her daughter Maria del Pilar 18.1911 Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria 1884 1958 Maria Luisa de Silva y Fernández de Henestrosa 1870 1955 Maria Luisa was created Infanta of Spain in 1927 18.19111 Prince Louis Alfonno of Bavaria (Infant of Spain) 1906 1983 18.19112 Prince Jose Eugenio of Bavaria (Infant of Spain) 1909 1966 Maria de la Asunción \"Marisol\" Solange de Mesia y Lesseps 1911 2005 Maria via her father was a great niece of Empress Eugenie of the French (1826-1920).\n\nMaria's great grandmother Maria Francesca de Sales Palafox de Guzmán Portocarrero y Kirkpatrick de Closeburn (1825-1860) was an elder sister of Maria Eugenia Ignacia Agustina de Palafox y Kirkpatrick (better known as Empress Eugénie of the French).\n\nBirth Registration of Maria de la Asunción Solange de Mesia y Lesseps 18.19113 Princess Maria de las Mercedes of Bavaria (Infanta of Spain) 1911 1953 Prince Irakly of Bagration-Mukhransky 1909 1977 Prince Irakly Bagration-Moukhransky is from one of the lines of the Bagration family who were former rulers of the Royal House of Georgia.\n\nThe situation regarding the Royal House of Georgia is somewhat complex and I profess not to understand it in any sort of detail. The Bagration family were Kings of Georgia from 1008 to 1466 which was then split into the three Kingdoms of Kartli, Imereti and Kakheti all under different offshoots of the Bagration family.\n\nThe first Duke of Mukhrani (i.e. Bagration of Mukhrani also known as Bagration-Moukhransky) was Bagrat (c1487  c1540) son of Konstantine II (c1447 1505) last King of united Georgia (1478-90) and first King of Kartli (1490-1505). It is from Bagrat that Prince Irakly is descended. The Kings of Kartli came from the Bagration of Mukhrani family line.\n\nThe Dukes of Mukhrani appear to me to have been transferred haphazardly between the different branches of Mukhrani descendants. On some occasions the Dukes of Mukhrani were also the Kings of Kartli.\n\nThe Kings of Kakheti came from another Branch of the Bagration family.\n\nWhen Jesse the last King of Kartli died in 1727 the two Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti were merged recreating the Kingdom of Georgia, the Kingdom of Imereti remained independent. The last King of Georgia (Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti) was George XII (1746-1800) whose male line descendant is Prince Nugzar Bagration-Gruzinsky of Georgia (born 25 August 1950) who claims the head of the Royal Family of Georgia.\n\nThe last Duke of Mukhrani was Konstantine IV who died in 1842 and Prince Irakly is his 2 x great grandson. In 1942 Prince Irakli who was of the genealogically senior branch of the Bagration dynasty, proclaimed himself Head of the Royal House of Georgia.\n\nPrince Irakly's grandson (i.e. from his second marriage to Maria Antonietta Pasquini dei Conti di Costafiorita) is Prince David of Bagration-Moukhransky (born 1976) who married Princess Anna Bagration-Gruzinsky (born 1976) in 2009. Princess Anna is the daughter of Prince Nugzar Bagration-Gruzinsky (above), thus the marriage united the Gruzinsky (Kakheti) and Moukhransky (Mukhraneli) branches of the Georgian royal family.\n\nPrince Irakly was a brother to Princess Leonida Bagration-Moukhransky 18.19114 Princess Maria del Pilar of Bavaria (Infanta of Spain) 1912 1918 18.1912 Prince Adalbert of Bavaria 1886 1970 Countess Auguste von Seefried auf Buttenheim 1899 1978 See 18.15213 18.19121 Prince Konstantin of Bavaria 1920 1969 Princess Marie Adelgunde of Hohenzollern 1921 2006 See 6.1122 - Konstantin died in an aeroplane accident at Hechingen. 18.19121 Prince Konstantin of Bavaria 1920 1969 Countess Helene Von Khevenhuller-Metsch 1921 2017 See 32.84134 - Konstantin died in an aeroplane accident at Hechingen.

In 1907 she decided to join the Benedictine nuns at Northwood, Isle of Wight. The Mother Superior of Northwood was Princess Adelheid zu Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg widow of King Miguel of Portugal. It should be noted that Northwood was the location of a country house which served as the temporary home for the nuns between 1901 and 1907 until they purchased Appley House near Ryde on which they built a church which became St Cecilia's Abbey. 18.2 Princess Augusta of Bavaria 1788 1851 Eugene de Beaharnais (1st Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1781 1824 Eugene was the adopted stepson of Emperor Napoleon I (through his first wife Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie, later Empress Josephine and Viscount Alexandre de Beaharnais. Alexandre, a French general was guillotined in 1794 during the French Revolution). Eugene was created Duke of Leuchtenberg with the title Prince(ss) of Leuchtenberg for his children on 14 November 1817 by his father-in-law King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria 18.21 Princess Josephine of Leuchtenberg 1807 1876 King Oscar I of Sweden (& Norway) 1799 1859 See 3.1 18.22 Princess Hortense of Leuchtenberg 1808 1847 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen 1801 1869 Friedrich Wilhelm ceded his sovereign rights to the King of Prussia in 7 December 1849 and his death brought an end to the Hechingen line of Hohenzollern 18.23 Duke August of Leuchtenberg (2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1810 1835 Queen Maria II of Portugal 1819 1853 See 12.41 - Maria became Queen of Portugal in 1826. A Coup d'etat by her uncle Miguel in 1828 resulted in him being proclaimed King of Portugal 1828 to 1834. Miguel was ousted in 1834, permanently leaving the Country thereby enabling restoration of Maria as Queen. Maria died giving birth to her stillborn daughter, Infanta Eugenio.\n\nAugust and Maria were married by absence on 1 Dec 1834 and in person at Lisbon 26 Jan 1835 and an interesting article relating to their marriage contract.\n\nIn February 1831 Duke August was one of three candidates considered as the new King of the Belgians. However none of these candidates succeeded since the throne went to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nA report on the death of August. 18.24 Princess Amelie of Leuchtenberg 1812 1873 King Pedro IV de Alcántara of Portugal (Emperor of Brazil) 1798 1834 See 12.4 - Brazil was demanding independence from Portugal and Pedro was proclaimed Emperor of Brazil (as Pedro I) on 12 October 1822. He also succeeded to the throne of Portugal on the death of his father and as he didn't want to leave Brazil he abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria on 29 April 1826. Pedro also abdicated the Brazilian Throne on 7 April 1831 in favour of his son Pedro II in order to return to Portugal to fight for the restoration of his daughter Maria to the throne of Portugal. 18.25 Princess Theodelinde of Leuchtenberg 1814 1857 Duke Wilhelm von Urach 1810 1869 See 22.53 - Wilhelm was previously Count Wilhelm of Württemberg and was created Duke von Urach on 28 May 1867, his issue bore the title Prince(ss) von Urach 18.26 Princess Carolina of Leuchtenberg 1816 1816 18.27 Duke Maximilian of Leuchtenberg (3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1817 1852 Grand Duchess Maria of Russia 1819 1876 See 4.92 - Maximilian's children were accorded the title Prince(ss) Romanovsky by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia on 14 July 1839.\n\nA tale about the romance of Grand Duchess Maria and Duke Maxinilian.\n\nReport on the marriage of Maximilian and Maria.\n\nA short report on the death of Maximilian 18.271 Princess Alexandra of Romanovsky 1840 1843 18.272 Princess Maria Romanovsky 1841 1914 Prince Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden 1829 1897 See 32.55 - A report on the death Princess Maria 18.273 Duke Nicholas of Leuchtenberg (4th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1843 1891 Nadezhda Annenkova 1840 1891 Nicholas's sons on 23 November 1890 were granted the title Duke von Leuchtenberg with the style of \"His Highness\" by an Imperial decree signed by Emperor Alexander III. The sons could not inherit the Imperial ducal title of Leuchtenberg as this could only be via legitimate heirs in the male line (parents of equal marriage), hence after Nicholas's death the Imperial ducal title passed to his brother Eugen. 18.2731 Duke Nicholas von Leuchtenberg 1868 1928 Countess Maria Grabbe 1869 1948 Nicholas on 23 November 1890 was granted the title Duke von Leuchtenberg with the style of \"His Highness\" by an Imperial decree signed by Emperor Alexander III. He could not inherit the Imperial ducal title of Leuchtenberg as this could only be via legitimate heirs in the male line (parents of equal marriage), hence after Nicholas's father's death the Imperial ducal title passed to his uncle Eugen. 18.2732 Duke George von Leuchtenberg 1872 1929 Princess Olga Repnin-Volkonskaya 1872 1953 George on 23 November 1890 was granted the title Duke von Leuchtenberg with the style of \"His Highness\" by an Imperial decree signed by Emperor Alexander III. He could not inherit the Imperial ducal title of Leuchtenberg as this could only be via legitimate heirs in the male line (parents of equal marriage), hence after George's father's death the Imperial ducal title passed to his uncle Eugen.\n\nIt was reported in a 1982 newspaper article that George got so excited about the affair surrounding the imposter Anna Anderson (1896-1984) that he invited \"Anna\" to stay in his Bavarian castle \"Schloss Seeon\" while her claim was checked. Although Anna Anderson travelled around various countries when she died in 1984 she was cremated the same day, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at \"Schloss Seeon\" on 18 June 1984. 18.274 Princess Eugenia Romanovsky 1845 1925 Duke Alexander of Oldenburg 1844 1932 See 31.224 18.2751 Countess Daria de Beauharnais 1870 1937 Prince Leon Kotchoubey 1862 1927 18.2751 Countess Daria de Beauharnais 1870 1937 Baron Waldemar von Gravenitz 1872 1916 18.275 Duke Eugen of Leuchtenberg (5th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1847 1901 Zinaida Skobeleva 1856 1899 A report on the strange assassination of Zinaida's mother.\n\nZinaida's brother was a renown Russian General and on his wedding day did an usual thing. His new wife had flouted him before their marriage and if to get back at her on leaving the church he made a low bow and left her never to speak to her again.\n\nWhen Zinaida died she left her jewellery to Count Belewskoi who it was reported was the son of Grand Duke Alexis. Grand Duke Alexis had an open affair with Zinaida apparently with the knowledge of her husband Duke Eugen 18.276 Prince Sergei Romanovsky 1849 1877 Prince Sergei was killed in action in Rustchuk during the Russian-Turkish War. He was killed in a most unfortunate circumstance, he was on his horse watching the movements of the Turkish enemy in what should have been a safe distance from possible danger. However this was not to be so and he was shot in the head and died immediately. 18.277 Duke George of Leuchtenberg (6th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1852 1912 Duchess Therese Friederike of Oldenburg 1852 1883 See 31.228 18.277 Duke George of Leuchtenberg (6th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1852 1912 Princess Stana \"Anastasia\" of Montenegro 1868 1935 See 40.3 18.2771 Duke Alexander of Leuchtenberg (7th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1881 1942 Nadeshda Caralli 1883 1964 An interesting account in 1909 of the reported intended marriage of Alexander to a Miss Marjorie Gould daughter of a wealthy financier and railroad executive. The intended marriage was denied at the time and obviously did not come to fruition.\n\nA further newspaper report in 1912 said that Emperor Nicholas II had given his consent to the marriage of Alexander to Maria Anna von Friedlander-fuld a wealthy heiress. 18.2772 Duke Sergei of Leuchtenberg (8th Duke of Leuchtenberg) 1890 1974 The death of Sergei brought an end to the Imperial line of the House of Leuchtenberg. No remaining heirs of full dynastic status remained; Sergei's parents' marriage (i.e. Duke George of Leuchtenberg , 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg and Princess Stana \"Anastasia\" of Montenegro) was the last equal marriage entered into by a male dynast of the House of Beauharnais. 18.2773 Princess Elena Romanowsky 1892 1971 Count Stefan Tyszkiewicz 1896 1976 Death Registration of Stefan Tyszkiewicz 18.3 Princess Amalie of Bavaria 1790 1794 18.4 Princess Charlotte \"Karoline\" Auguste of Bavaria 1792 1873 King Wilhelm I of Württemberg 1781 1864 See 22.11 18.4 Princess Charlotte \"Karoline\" Auguste of Bavaria 1792 1873 Emperor Franz I of Austria 1768 1835 See 19 - Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria on 11 August 1804 and on 6 August 1806 became the last Holy Roman Emperor on its dissolution.\n\nEmperor Franz was married four times:\n\nFirst - Duchess Elizabeth of Württemberg\n\nSecond - Princess Maria of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nThird - Archduchess Maria Ludowika of Austia-Este (Modena)\n\nFourth - Princess Charlotte \"Karoline\" Auguste of Bavaria 18.5 Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria 1795 1875 Sophie Petin 1796 1838 Sophie was created Baroness von Bayrstorff in 1823 18.5 Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria 1795 1875 Henriette Schoelter 1816 1866 Henriette was created Baroness von Frankenberg in 1859.\n\nIt was reported that Karl Theodor died after a fall from his horse 18.6 Prince Maximilian of Bavaria 1800 1803 18.7 Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 1801 1873 King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia 1795 1861 See 11.1 - Princess Elizabeth and Princess Amalie were twins 18.8 Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria 1801 1877 King Johann of Saxony 1801 1873 See 26.66 - Princess Elizabeth and Princess Amalie were twins. 18.9 Princess Sophie of Bavaria 1805 1872 Archduke Franz Karl of Austria 1802 1878 See 19.J 18.J Princess Marie Anne of Bavaria 1805 1877 King Friedrich August II of Saxony 1797 1854 See 26.63 18.K Princess Ludivika of Bavaria 1808 1892 Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria 1808 1888 Maximilian's grandfather Duke Wilhelm von Birkenfeld-Gelnhausen (1752 - 1837) married Countess Marie Anne of Birkenfeld-Zweibruken (1753 - 1824) who was a sister of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (born Count of Birkenfeld-Zweibruken).
