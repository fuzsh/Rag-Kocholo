However, these three nephews divided the land with him. Albert II retained Saxe-Wittenberg, and became the head of the Elder Saxon Line; Albert III, Eric I and John II ruled together in Saxe-Lauenburg, becoming the founders of the Younger Saxon Line. 1296–1298 Saxe-Wittenberg John I 1249 1260–1282 30 July 1285 Saxony Ingeborg Birgersdotter of Sweden\n\n1270\n\neight children In 1296 Albert II and his nephews Albert III, Eric I, and John II ended their joint rule and divided Saxony into the Lauenburg line, where Albert III, Eric I, and John II continued to rule jointly until 1303, and the Wittenberg line, where Albert II continued as sole ruler until 1298. Since the Duke of Saxony was considered one of the prince-electors electing a new Holy Roman Emperor, conflict arose between the lines of Lauenburg and Wittenberg over the issue of who should cast Saxony's vote. In 1314 both lines found themselves on different sides in a double election. Eventually, the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg succeeded in 1356 after the promulgation of the Golden Bull. To distinguish him from other rulers bearing the title Duke of Saxony, he was commonly called Elector of Saxony.

Albert passed the land to his widow, and after her death, in 1315, the territory was realigned: Eric divided Bergdorf with his surviving brother and held all of his brother Albert's inheritance. However, he ended up abdicating to his son, and survived for most of his reign. 1303–1322 Saxe-Mölln Eric I 1280 1296–1303 1360 Saxe-Lauenburg Elisabeth of Pomerania\n\n1316 or 1318\n\nfour children 1303–1338 Saxe-Bergedorf\n\n(1303-15)\n\nSaxe-Ratzeburg\n\n(1315-38) Albert III 1281 1296-1303 1308 Saxe-Lauenburg Margaret of Brandenburg-Salzwedel\n\n1302\n\ntwo children 1303–1308 Saxe-Ratzeburg Margaret of Brandenburg-Salzwedel 1270 1308–1315 1 May 1315 Saxe-Ratzeburg Przemysł II, King of Poland\n\n1302\n\ntwo children\n\nAlbert III\n\n1302\n\ntwo children In 1315, after the death of Margaret of Brandenburg, the remaining brothers Eric and John redesigned the political division in Saxe-Lauenburg; Eric retained all of Margaret's part, but had to give part of his original domains to his brother.

The Ascanian Dynasty continued in Saxe-Lauenburg until 1689, but after the Lauenburgish line had finally lost the Saxon Electorate to the Wittenberg line in 1356 and failed to obtain the succession in the Electorate after 1422, recognition of the Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg as Dukes of Saxony waned.
