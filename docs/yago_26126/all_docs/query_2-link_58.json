        "text": "Agreed, there was no way for Bavaria to stay neutral, and I think both Max Joseph and Montgelas were very aware of this. Bavaria was placed between two millstones, and their only chance to survive was to hide behind one of them. It was only a question of which to pick. And in this case, an alliance with France seemed much more lucrative, and Napoleon had promised both Tyrole and independence from Vienna by upgrading the country to a kingdom.\n\nAs to the marriage however, they really tried to get around it, literally to the very last minute. And if Napoleon had not stayed in person until the wedding and had seen the whole thing through, they would have found a way to get out of it somehow. Max was very good at not committing himself üòÅ.\n\nHere's what happened at the outbreak of the war:\n\nOn September 6, 1805, the family of Bavarian elector Max Joseph was still staying at their summer residence, Nymphenburg Castle. On that very day, Austrian prince Karl Philipp zu Schwarzenberg, escorted by 100 dragoons, reached Munich and demanded an audience. (Yes, that's the same Schwarzenberg commanding at Leipzig 1813 and Paris 1814). Depending on who you ask, the tone of the ensuing interview and the purpose of this visit vary: According to Austrian sources, Schwarzenberg merely wanted to ensure that Bavarian troops would fight alongside the Austrians in the upcoming war against France. According to Bavarian sources, Schwarzenbergs dragoons surrounded the castle, and Schwarzenberg set an ultimatum: Either Bavaria's army would fight under Austrian command, or Austria would consider Bavaria an enemy.\n\nBoth versions actually are not mutually exclusive. They could just be two very different perceptions of the same request.\n\nMax Joseph reacted the same way he always did: he got sick. During the interview with Schwarzenberg he looked so miserable the Austrian prince was really sympathetic and also wrote to Vienna about it. Max Joseph declared himself too ill to do anything and sent Schwarzenberg to Montgelas (who was actually ill). As soon as Schwarzenberg had left Nymphenburg, Max Joseph wrote a long letter to Montgelas that started with \"The bomb has gone off!\", then detailed Bavaria's situation within European foreign policies under all aspects and then some, and ended with announcing Schwarzenberg's visit to Montgelas the following morning, stating \"See what can be answered to him. I'm beside myself, in a horrible situation!\" Adding a jolly \"Good Night!\"\n\nTo summarize: \"Dear Montgelas, the Austrians are here! Please do something, while I'm going to bed.\"\n\nMontgelas in all likelyhood did not have a good night. As a matter of fact, Bavarian diplomats and military went into a flurry of activities from that moment on.\n\nThe other day, prince Schwarzenberg met with Montgelas. Montgelas immediately told him that a decision about war and peace could only be made by the elector himself. Over the course of the next two days, poor Schwarzenberg wandered from Max Joseph to Montgelas and back, received lots of very polite statements and assurances, to the point when he and Austrian ambassador Buol were convinced Bavaria was on Austria's side. Max Joseph also sent a letter to emperor Franz in Vienna, asking for Bavaria's neutrality (which he already knew he'd never get).\n\nAnd then, during the night of September 8/9, the court left town. Completely. When Buol and Schwarzenberg showed up on the 9th, they were handed a letter from Max Joseph, stating that as his health required an immediate change of air, he had left for W√ºrzburg. And so had pretty much everybody else, including Montgelas. At the same time, Bavarian diplomat Gravenreuth and some others were informing and gathering the Bavarian troops and also sent them north, where they would later team up with Bernadotte's corps coming from Hanover. (A certain colonel Beaumont, travelling along the borders of Bavaria at the same time, a dashing cavalryman with long dark curls, who in Paris would have been immediately recognized as Prince Joachim Murat, was already very well informed about the elector's whereabouts and must have been in contact with Bavaria's court as well.)\n\nOnly when the Austrians crossed the inn onto Bavarian territory and met the first Bavarian parliamentary they were told that Bavaria would not comply with Austria's demands and would consider the Austrian forces enemies. Oops. (Allegedly, this news didn't quite spread, and Austrians politely let the Bavarians empty their depots and even gave them carriages and horses to do so.)\n\nIn the meantime, Max Joseph and Co. were waiting in W√ºrzburg. It's quite unclear to me if Karoline and Auguste were even aware that Austria was the enemy this time, at the very least there were still debates about which side to choose, even after Austrian forces had occupied Munich. Karoline of course was pro-Austrian, and Max apparently just smiled nervously and kept mum. The letters French ambassador Otto sent to Parus during this time are very funny. \"My greatest enemies here are the tears of the electress.\" At some point, even Austrian ambassador Buol showed up and was happily welcomed by Max Joseph, as if nothing had happened. That was the moment an exasperated Montgelas was ready to retire from office.\n\nBut then, in the last days of September, came Bernadotte, and all was well. Except for Max Joseph, of cours. The poor guy now had to confess his sin (the alliance with France) to his electress. And to his son, who was still travelling and had already asked if he should go to the Austrian headquarters at Ulm. He was sent to Strasbourg to see empress Josephine instead, and decidely better off there.\n\nAfter Ulm, Napoleon came to Munich and probably expected to meet Max Joseph in his capital. However, Max Joseph, after all these political and domestic worries, had taken to his bed again. And just to be on the safe side, he stayed there until Napoleon had left. In the meantime, Ludwig also had reached Munich, and in November father and son set out for Linz, where they were very well received by Napoleon. We have some remarks by Ludwig himself of this meeting (as much as he hated Napoleon, he was also fascinated enough to scribble down plenty of notes on him).\n\nAccording to Napolen, during this meeting in Linz he and Max Joseph agreed that Auguste would marry Eug√®ne. According to Max, he had promised no such thing. At least that's what he told Auguste and Karoline. As late as mid-December, while Gravenreuth in Sch√∂nbrunn was negotiating with Napoleon and Talleyrand about Bavaria's future borders, Max Joseph in Munich still talked about Auguste being engaged to Carl von Baden. This led to a rather unpleasant encounter between Napoleon and Gravenreuth in Sch√∂nbrunn, because Otto of course informed Napoleon of this. Montgelas still tried to make everyone happy, suggesting that Auguste, as she declared to be so very much in love with Carl, should marry the guy, and the younger princess Charlotte should be given to the viceroy. Gravenreuth sent a sarcastic reply (\"How many centuries removed from the one we currently live in are you?\"), arguing that the time for negotiations had long passed and that Napoleon since the victory of Austerlitz was in an all powerful position that would make any refusal dangerous. Max Joseph, however, still would not budge, until Duroc showed up with the official marriage offer on christmas day, making it also clear that the French had read Max Joseph's letters to the Baden court and knew precisely how the Wittelsbach family truly felt about this Beauharnais person.\n\nThat was when Max Joseph just had no way to get out of this quagmire anymore. But instead of going to his daughter in person and talking to her, he wrote her a letter, basically telling this 17-year-old girl that the French emperor was dead set on the marriage to this awful Beauharnais person (who might not be so bad after all, maybe?) and that Bavaria's future and the future of the whole family depended on it and that so he begged her to agree. But no pressure, child. By the way, please spare my poor nerves the agitation of a direct confrontation and send me your answer in writing, okay? Love, Dad. - To which Auguste then dutifully replied that she would gladly sacrifice herself for father and fatherland, asking for Max Joseph's blessing which would help her to bear her dark fate in resignation.\n\nAs I said, much of this could be part of a comedy, the punchline being that the bridegroom really turned out to be about the nicest guy who could be found in Napoleon's extended family, friendly, amiable, charming, very eager to make himself loved ... According to one of Josephine's ladies-in-waiting, bride and bridegroom at their first meeting had a private conversation of about ten minutes, from which they returned beaming, holding hands and very ready to sacrifice themselves for their respective fatherlands or any other reason. Auguste's diary suggests that it did indeed take a bit longer for her to fall in love, and Eug√®ne probably would have preferred to remain single. But they really ended up being very happy with each other (despite Eug√®ne, like pretty much every husband of the era, having multiple affairs), and all the negative things that would happen to them only brought them together more closely.\n\nThe one who fell in love with Eug√®ne the hardest, however, was probably Max Joseph üòã. First of all, he was relieved and grateful that Eug√®ne made Auguste truly happy, when Max had broken his promise that his daughter would marry her cousin Carl von Baden. But Eug√®ne also was similar in character to Max himself in many aspects. Actually, that was the son Max had always wanted, brave soldier, optimistic, humble, sociable, good-natured, friendly, French! ... (and what had he gotten instead? Ludwig.). As family was an important matter to Max Joseph, the personal friendship to his son-in-law turned into yet another thing linking Bavaria to Napoleon's empire. And this friendship survived plenty of obstacles, including them being technically at war since autumn 1813."
