        "text": "Today is the 210th birth anniversary of Duchess Ludovika in Bavaria (born as Princess Maria Ludovika Wilhelmine of Bavaria), the day of her birth is 30.08.1808, and the place is Schloss Nymphenburg. She was the daughter of the first Bavarian king, Maximilian I Joseph, a member of the House of Wittelsbach and her second wife, Karoline (Caroline) of Baden, who was the first Queen consort of Bavaria.\n\nLudovika was the 12th child of 13, and 7th from the second marriage of her father. One of her siblings was still-born and four of them died in childhood. The others become king, queens and empress. Amalie Auguste and Maria Anna became Queen consort of Saxony, Carolina Augusta was Empress of Austria, the wife of Emperor Francis I of Austria, and of course her older brother, Ludwig was the second Bavarian king.\n\nLudovika didn’t get a monarch as husband. She had a relationship with Miguel I of Portugal, but later she had to marry her cousin’s son, Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria. The wedding was on 9.9.1828.\n\nTheir marriage wasn’t happy, but they had 10 children:\n\nLudwig Wilhelm (nickname Louis, 1831-1920): had a morganatical marriage with actress Henriette Mendel. Their daughter was Marie (Wallersee-)Larisch, who helped Crown Prince Rudolf and her girlfriend, Baroness Mary Vetsera in their relationship. They had an other son who died in childhood. After the death of Henriette he had an other marriage with Barbara Antonie Barth.\n\nWilhelm Karl: lived 2 months (1832-1833).\n\nHelene Caroline Therese (nickname Néné, 1834-1890): she could have become Empress of Austria, but the Emperor chose her sister, Elisabeth. Later she married Maximilian Anton Lamoral, Hereditary Prince of Thurn und Taxis. They had a short, but happy marriage with four children.\n\nElisabeth Amalie Eugenie (nickname Sisi, 1837-1898): the wife of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia and a cousin of her husband. The beginning of their marriage was happy, but later departed from each other. They had four children, too. Sisi was Ludovika’s most famous daughter.\n\nKarl Theodor (nickname Gackl, 1839-1909): he had six children from his two marriages. Later he became an optician. With her second wife, Infanta Maria Josepha of Portugal they had an eye-clinic named Augenklinik Herzog Carl Theodor. He was a forefather of the Belgian king, Philippe.\n\nMaria Sophie (1841-1925): her husband was the King of the Two Sicilies. Their marrige wasn’t happy, they had just one daughter, who died in childhood. She had twins from another man. The children didn’t know about their real mother. In 1860-61 during the Siege of Gaeta she became a hero and she got the name “warrior queen”. Maria and her husband was deprived of the throne in 1861. She was the last Queen consort of the Two Sicilies.\n\nMathilde Ludovika (1843-1925): she was the wife of her sister, Maria’s husband’s halfbrother, Prince Louis, Count of Trani, so Mathilde was a Princess of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and Countess of Trani. She had two daughters: one of them from her husband and one of them from a Spanish duke. Her second daughter never knew about her mother.\n\nMaximilian (8.12.1845): stillborn.\n\nSophie Charlotte Augustine (1847-1897): she was the last daughter of her parents. First Sophie was a fiancée of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, but their engagement was broken by the duchess’ parents. In 1868 she married Prince Ferdinand of OrléansDuke of Alençon. Their wedding mostly was happy. They had a daughter and a son. Hear death was really sad: she died in a fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris on 4.5.1897.\n\nMaximilian Emanuel (nickname Mapperl, 1849-1893): he was the last children of Max and Ludovika. Maximilian loved the military, he was a part of it since the age of sixteen. His wife was Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, their marriage was happy. The couple had three sons.\n\nLudovika loved her children and heeded for their education. Because her husband travelled a lot, she managed their property. She did a good job. Her relationship with Max wasn’t cool, e.g: Maximilian had two natural daughters. He brought his natural children to his palace, to his family. But Ludovika couldn’t do anything. This was the reason why she paid more attention to her daughters and sons.\n\nThe Duke and the Duchess were married for sixty years. They celebrated their diamond wedding in 1888 and Max died in the next Autumn.\n\nLudovika survived her husband four years and died on 25 or 26 January 1892.\n\nI guess Ludovika was a kind, strong, nice, amazing and wonderful woman. Respect for her!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
