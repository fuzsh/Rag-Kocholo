        "text": "I picked this card up on Saturday 19 - 02 - 2011\n\nwhile at a Collector's Fair\n\nin the central Romanian city of Brasov, I hope its of interest\n\nto some of our members,\n\nIt shows Auguste Maria Louise von Bayern.\n\nQuote\n\n(Auguste Maria Louise Prinzessin von Bayern was born on 28 April 1875.\n\nShe was the daughter of Leopold Maximilian Joseph Maria Arnulf Prinz von Bayern\n\nand Gisela Louise Marie Erzherzogin von Österreich.\n\nShe married Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria Erzherzog von Österreich,\n\nson of Joseph Karl Ludwig Erzherzog von Österreich\n\nand Marie Adelheid Amalie Clothilde Prinzessin von Sachsen-Coburg-Saalfeld,\n\non 15 November 1893.\n\nShe died on 25 June 1964 at age 89 at Regensburg, Germany.\n\nAuguste Maria Louise Prinzessin von Bayern was a member of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nShe gained the title of Prinzessin von Bayern.)\n\n:-\n\nShoulder Insignia.\n\nRed Cross Belt.\n\nCaption in German / Austrian.\n\nPhotographer.\n\nRear of the card.\n\nConnaught Stranger.\n\nA nice acquisition, CS. There were a fair few Wittelsbach princesses, and none of them appear to have been great beauties, but most do seem to have been women of very considerable character and practicality. Augusta certainly looks as if she would have brooked no nonsense while she stabbed a syringe into someone's buttock. Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians was another Wittelsbach princess who did not shrink from rolling up her sleeves.\n\nFound this photo of a formidable looking lady in a nursing uniform of some form\n\nbut all I can find out about her is as follows\n\n\"Princess Auguste of Bavaria (German: Auguste Maria Luise Prinzessin von Bayern) ( 28 April 1875 – 25 June 1964) was a member of the Bavarian Royal House of Wittelsbach and the spouse of Archduke Joseph August of Austria.\n\nAuguste was born in Munich, Bavaria, the second child of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and his wife Archduchess Gisela of Austria. She had one older sister, Princess Elisabeth Marie of Bavaria and two younger brothers, Prince Georg of Bavaria and Prince Konrad of Bavaria.\"\n\nAnyone got anything to add?"
