        "text": "This might seem a smidge on the side of random, but apparently it actually happened. When Napoléon was negotiating for the marriage of his stepson, Eugène de Beauharnais to the Bavarian princess, Auguste Amalie, it was suggested to him (by some of his ministers, as well as some at the court in Münich), that he should put aside Josèphine and marry Auguste instead. His response was righteous indignation that anyone dare suggest such an idea (I’m not sure if this is where his (apocryphal?) comment comes from about “deserting a good woman” and that if Italy/Egypt had been a disaster, Josèphine would’ve stuck by him and all that, originated). So, while no one was certain that Josèphine was the reason he had no children (he had said of his ‘Clioupatre’, Pauline Foures ‘the little fool doesn’t know how to have one [a child]’), and Josèphine pointed to Eugène and Hortense as proof that she wasn’t the problem, Napoléon was charmed by the portrait of Auguste on a cup presented to him, and sent it on to Eugène. So, what if he takes the decision to put Josèphine aside (besides all his family having a month long party), and marry Auguste instead? I can’t think – given his personality, and affection for Josèphine, Eugène and Hortense – that he would throw them to the wolves. Hortense is after all married to his brother, Eugène is a competent and loyal soldier, and Napoléon’s busy negotiating a marriage for their cousin, Stéphanie to the heir to Baden (despite Jérôme Bonaparte preferring Stéphanie’s company to his wife’s OTL). Josèphine is the only outlier here. AFAIK, she and Auguste got along well OTL, but here, Auguste’s coming to Paris to poach her husband, so maybe not such an amicable relationship?\n\nNapoleon’s otl son was half German as well.\n\nHalf-Austrian. This one is half-German. It's probably more a modern thing. But also Marie Louise's parents were born (and raised) in Italy, before coming to rule in Germany. The Wittelsbachs of Auguste's branch have never really ruled anywhere else (at least not in the last century).\n\nI think this specifically refers to a second son. I certainly don’t consider that very exciting, but I don’t really consider dynastic politics as a whole very exciting.\n\nWhat would be interesting is the political ideology and the political role such a child would play.\n\nWell, in general the line of Wittelsbachs that ruled Bavaria up until 1777 had a love-hate relationship with the Habsburgs - they married into the imperial family several times, tried for the imperial crown once or twice (got it once, couldn't keep it though). And then comes Karl Theodor who's willing to trade Bavaria to the Habsburgs for the Austrian Netherlands, and later Maximilian I who seems to be pretty chummy with Austria in the 19th century against Prussia (where someone like Maximilian II Emanuel might've played Austria and Prussia off against each other). So, perhaps this kid would cement the Wittelsbachs into an anti-Austrian policy?\n\nAs to the political ideaology/political role - I guess it would depend. If we see an analogue of OTL events, Napoléon overreaching himself (not sure how likely that would be with a POD in 1806) and falling around the mid-1810s, Junior's gonna be a kid of at most, eight years old (in 1815). That's a little older than the king of Rome was OTL, but his mother's father is also a lot less powerful than Rome's maternal grandfather. What happens to the kid? Are Britain and her allies willing to see the kid become the new ruler of France (thanks to his grandfather's secondary power status?) or do they still pull for a Restoration of sorts? I do feel that if they punish Napoléon they'll be a lot more severe on Maximilian here (most likely he doesn't defect at the end like OTL), choosing between siding against your traditional enemy (Austria/Prussia/Britain) or your traditional ally, who also happens to be your son-in-law/grandson (France) seems like a bit of no-brainer to me. Although, admittedly, the Zweibrucken branch of Wittelsbachs seem to have been more opportunists than anything else. And the ideology or political role would depend on whether the boy is - as previously mentioned - left esconced as emperor of the French or deposed as prince of Eichstatt? If the former, he's likely to develop on very different lines to the latter.\n\nHalf-Habsburg - which prior to Napoléon and after him - ruled a good portion of Italy. Seeing little Charles (figure Nappy would name his second son after his dad) become king of Italy when he has less dynastic links to the country (I know, Napoléon didn't have links to anywhere when he became emperor, but the Italians might prefer a half-Habsburg Bonaparte king to a half-Wittelsbach king) seems a push. Hence why I suggested as a sort of German viceroy for his brother, the French emperor.\n\nNapoléon had broken the Habsburg yoke on Italy, and while I don't see throwing Eugène under a bus, I don't see Nap giving him what is nominated as a secundogeniture for the French emperor (for all intents and purposes). So the only way Eugène would keep Italy is if his one-time-stepdad doesn't have a second son. Maybe @Yanez de Gomera or someone else can help out here and say if Eugène might be considered as a replacement for Naples (if Joseph still gets sent to Spain) instead of Murat, while Prince Charles Bonaparte gets the Iron Crown of Lombard?\n\nIf Auguste marry Napoleon Eugene will likely marry another German princess and at least stay as Viceroy of Italy. I think who a divorce of Napoleon and Josephine at this time will very likely include in the settlement a royal or semi royal bride and his own Kingdom or Dukedom for Eugene\n\nSuggestions? Stéphanie's doing Baden, Jérôme is securing Württemberg. Maybe Princess Auguste of Saxony? I seem to think there was talk of her perhaps marrying a Bonaparte(-relative), but a match with Prince Joszef Poniatowski was viewed as a better option. Unfortunately it never came off. Eugène wedding Auguste and fathering the future dukes of Warsaw/kings of Poland by her could be fun. Otherwise, I wonder if Napoléon wouldn't be less interested in Eugène and thus perhaps M. de Beauharnais ends up as king of Sweden instead of Bernadotte (the original proposal, which was scuttled because someone (can't remember who) insisted that Eugène remain a Catholic rather than convert to the Church of Sweden).\n\nI agree with you that Nappy the Second was ambitious - he wanted to be something more than a footnote in history, but could not be let to do so. However, I will say that Napoleon the Third was over-ambitious - his reach far exceeded his grasp within the domains of Mexico, Italy, and starting a war with Prussia. But now, let us get back to the problem at hand - a Bavarian princess for Napoleon would give him some help with holding some of the Germanic states but not all - there would be an undercurrent that he was an usurper, tyrant, and the Germanic princes would look for any chink in the armor to exploit and send Napoleon the First into exile. It was the same problem he had with an Austrian princess as I outline before - it would be a matter of time before his in-laws stabbed him in the back and try to return back to the days before the French Revolution. If one wants to truly secure a position of Napoleon in France, one must do away with all the Bourbons - all of them, every brother or cousin that could in theory take the throne - this would rob the Congress of Vienna's attempt at putting things back before the French Revolution, they would be saddled with a sad choice - let France become a republic (unthinkable and impossible), recognize that Napoleon was the only ruler France could have, or set up a regency where Napoleon II would rule sending his father into exile."
