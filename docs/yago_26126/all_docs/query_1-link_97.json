        "text": "Marriage and issue\n\nSophie married Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria, fifth child and third-eldest son of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, on 11 February 1865 in Dresden. Sophie and Karl-Theodor had one child:\n\nDuchess Amalie in Bavaria (24 December 1865 – 26 May 1912)\n\nIllness and death\n\nChildbirth caused severe respiratory problems for Sophie, which progressively weakened her, although she managed to recover. However, a year later she contracted a severe case of influenza that she could not overcome. Sophie died shortly before her 22nd birthday on 9 March 1867 and was interred at Tegernsee Abbey.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n15 March 1845 – 11 February 1865: Her Royal Highness Princess Sophie of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony"
