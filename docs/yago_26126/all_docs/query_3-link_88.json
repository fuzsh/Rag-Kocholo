From early medieval times, the term \"Saxony\" was applied exclusively to the land in north-west Germany which is now known as \"Niedersachsen\" (Lower Saxony). From the 15th century onwards, it came to describe the part of central Germany which lay east of Thuringia, the area which later evolved into the kingdom of Saxony. This unusual change in geographical emphasis can be traced to the appointment in 1423 of the head of the Wettin family as elector of Saxony, the Wettin family's territorial strongholds lying far from the traditional Saxon heartland. The southern part of the original Saxony was Westphalia, although the duchy of Westphalia existed only briefly as a political entity in 1180 before the title was transferred to the archbishop of Köln . The northern part of Saxony developed into Hannover, which was later incorporated into the territories of the dukes of Brunswick.\n\nThe Saxons probably originated in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, migrating southwards from the 3rd century onwards. Their expansion included the invasion and colonisation of England. Their homeland in northern Germany was conquered neither by the Romans nor the barbarians who migrated into western Europe during the 4th and 5th centuries, presumably because its barrenness presented few attractions to potential invaders. This insulation from outside influences may partly explain the decentralised way in which Saxony developed, in contrast to the more centralised administration which evolved in the other German provinces, particularly Bavaria. By the early 8th century, Saxon territory extended from the northern coast around Kiel to the southern edge of the north German plain, and was bounded by the river Elbe to the east and the land of the Frisians to the west. The Saxons paid tribute to the Merovingian Frankish kings at the rate of 400 cows a year until 631 . The Franks protected their northern borders with raids on Saxony recorded in 718, 738, 748 and 758, after the last of which a tribute of 300 horses was imposed . Frankish campaigns against Saxony intensified in 772, followed by a mass execution of Saxons at Verden in 782 and the surrender of the Saxon leader Widukind in 785 . The Annalista Saxo records that Charles I King of the Franks (later Emperor Charlemagne) established the bishoprics of Bremen, Halberstadt, Hildesheim, Verden, Paderborn, Minden, Münster and Osnabrück in Saxony in 781 . Saxon resistance persisted but peace was established in 803, involving full integration of the territory into the Frankish empire . After the partition of the Carolingian territories under the 843 Treaty of Verdun, Saxony formed part of the kingdom of the East Franks, which evolved into the kingdom of Germany. Although significant central cohesion was achieved in Germany by the Ottonian emperors in the 10th century, Saxony maintained a considerable amount of autonomy.\n\nEarly Saxon leadership probably constituted no more than a loose confederation of village chiefs, the extent of their cohesion at any one time depending on the level of threat from outside forces. No precise information has been found on pre-Frankish conquest Saxon government. Widukind, named both in Frankish sources and later German chronicles as Saxon leader in the later decades of the 8th century, may owe his reputed leadership position more to his subsequent almost legendary status rather than contemporary reality. It is probable that he was the most powerful of the local chieftains but that he was \"first among equals\" rather than acknowledged ruler. It is clear that Saxony had no long tradition of central leadership in contrast, for example, to the kingdom of Bavaria, although the descendants of Widukind appear to have been the first Saxon noble family to acquired semi-leadership status (see Chapter 1). The situation did not change after the integration of Saxony into the Carolingian Frankish empire. Imperial diplomas and other contemporary sources name numerous counts in Saxony during the first 150 years of Frankish rule, but none is acknowledged as leader prior to the Annales Alamannicorum which name \"Ludolfus dux Saxoniæ avus Heinrici\" among those who swore allegiance in 864 . This collegiate form of government in Saxony appears to be corroborated by the list recorded in Einhard's Annals of the Frankish signatories of the 811 peace with the Danes , in which at least five of the eleven names are recognisably Saxon but none is stated to be Saxon leader .\n\nThe Frankish local territorial administration unit, the pagus, was presumably introduced into Saxony only after a certain degree of internal stability was achieved after the 803 peace. The \"-gau\" suffix, applied to the names of local administrative units, appears in imperial diplomas from the mid-9th century. It is unlikely that this was a purely Saxon term as it is used in relation to pagi located in all the original German provinces. The Carolingian Frankish kings also added levels of ecclesiastical administration. Emperor Louis \"the Pious\" created the new bishoprics of Hildesheim and Halberstadt, whose territories were divided between the archiepiscopal provinces of Köln and Mainz, and founded the Saxon-based monastic communities at Essen, Herford and Corvey.\n\nDuring the mid-9th century, the Liudolfinger family replaced the Widukind family as the most powerful Saxon noble family (see Chapter 2), although the extent of their leadership status and their exact legal relationship with the German king are unclear. Several early sources refer to Liudolf as dux, but there is no record of his formal appointment as Saxon leader. Nevertheless, Ludolf's son Otto \"der Erlauchte\" was powerful enough to be a credible candidate for the royal succession after the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty in 911, and his own son Heinrich was elected king of Germany in 919. His descendants are known to history as the \"Saxon dynasty\" of German king/emperors, in reference to their origin but not to the family's previous status as acknowledged dukes of Saxony.\n\nThe third power force to emerge chronologically in Saxony was the family of Hermann Billung (see Chapter 3), who was appointed military chief in Saxony by Emperor Otto I and referred to as dux from 965. The ducal title attributed to the Billung dukes was at first not linked specifically with the territory of Saxony in contemporary documentation, maybe because of the largely military authority of the title-holder and the focus of his efforts on protecting the eastern frontier against the Slavs. From the late 10th century onwards, contemporary sources name a single \"dux\" in Saxony at any one time. Nevertheless, it is more appropriate to refer to Duke Hermann and his immediate successors as dukes \"in Saxony\" rather than \"of Saxony\". The title \"Duke of Saxony\" or \"Duke of the Saxons\" is first noted in documentation from the early 11th century.\n\nThe choice of Lothar von Süpplingenburg to succeed as duke of Saxony after the extinction of the Billung family in the male line in 1106 marked a turning point in Saxon history (see Chapter 4). Although his appointment was designed to limit the growing influence of the two more obvious candidates, Heinrich \"der Schwarze\" of the Welf dynasty and Otto Graf von Ballenstedt of the Askanian dynasty, both sons-in-law of the last Billung Duke Magnus, Lothar created a powerful new force in Saxon politics. He was fortunate in expanding his own territorial holdings through inheritance. He also extended ducal authority into the northern frontier area of Nordalbingia and brought under his control the western part of the duchy. He created many new countships, directly responsible to him. Within a few years, Duke Lothar had effectively transformed himself into the head of a Saxon nation, breaking imperial power in Saxony with his defeat of the imperial army at Welfesholz near Mansfeld in 1115. He further demonstrated his autonomy from imperial control in 1123 when he conferred the Markgrafschaft of Lausitz on Albrecht \"der Bär\" Graf von Ballenstedt and the Markgrafschaft of Meissen on Konrad von Wettin. By 1125, Duke Lothar had risen to such prominence that he was elected king of Germany after the death of Emperor Heinrich V.\n\nAfter his accession to the German throne, Lothar retained the duchy of Saxony in his own hands. He pursued the policy of creating new countships, including Wöltingerode, Wernigerode, Scharzfels, Ilfeld-Honstein, and perhaps Rothenburg. This further complicated the political scene in Saxony as these new creations were by definition imperial not ducal fiefs. The result was that later dukes were never the sole imperial fiefholders in the province, although the personal territorial holding in Saxony of each successive duke was significant. The rivalry between the duke and the other Saxon nobility intensified after the installation of the Welf Heinrich \"der Löwe\" as duke in 1139 (see Chapter 5), aggravated by his acquisition of numerous additional territories by inheritance or aggression. The power struggle culminated in the 1166/1170 rebellion of princes who considered their positions threatened by Duke Heinrich's expansionism.\n\nThe Ballenstedt family finally succeeded as dukes of Saxony in 1180, after Duke Heinrich \"der Löwe\" was deposed (see Chapter 7). The Saxon ruler's role as one of the seven electors of the Empire was irrevocably confirmed in 1356 by the Golden Bull of Emperor Karl IV, which also decreed that the Duke of Saxony should be imperial administrator of the territory subject to Saxon law in the absence of the Emperor . After the death in 1422 of Elector Albrecht IV, last descendant in the male line of the Ballenstedt dynasty, Emperor Sigmund appointed Friedrich IV \"der Streitbare\" Markgraf von Meissen and Landgraf of Thuringia as duke of Saxony (see Chapter 8). His descendants continued to rule Saxony until after the First World War.\n\nThe dukes of Saxony and their ancestors are set out in this document. A collection of early Saxon counts is shown in GERMANY, EARLY NOBILITY. For the families of later counts and other lesser nobility in Saxony, see SAXONY NOBILITY. In addition, the families of the counts and princes of ANHALT, dukes of BRUNSWICK, counts of HOLSTEIN and counts of OLDENBURG, all nobility whose territories developed within the original Saxon heartland, are set out in their respective documents.\n\nChapter 1. EARLY SAXON LEADERS, family of WIDUKIND\n\nThe relationship between the following individual Saxon chiefs and small family groups cannot be established. However, the repeated use of names, in particular Theoderich and Widukind, over the course of two centuries suggests a close family connection, although this may have been through either the male or female line. As noted in the Introduction to the present document, the family of Widukind constituted one of the three main power sources in Saxony until well into the 11th century.\n\n1. HADUGATO (-after [531]). Adam of Bremen names \"Hadugato\" as the duke of the Saxons to whom \"Theodericus rex Francorum\" sent legates , undated but recorded immediately after the Thuringian invasion of Theoderic I King of the Franks which is dated to 531.\n\n1. THEODERIC (-after 743). Einhard records that \"Karlomannus\" was in Saxony at \"castrum Hohseoburg\" and there accepted the surrender of \"Theodericum Saxonem illius loci primarium\" in 743 . Theoderic was captured again in 744 when Carloman invaded Saxony with his brother Pepin . Pepin King of the Franks invaded Saxony once more in 758, captured Sythen and required an annual tribute of 300 horses from the Saxons .\n\n2. WIDUKIND (-7 Jan 810) . The Royal Frankish Annals record that Widukind rebelled against the authority of Charles I King of the Franks, who had invaded and subdued Saxony, and fled to Denmark [\"Nordmannia\"] in 777 . The Annales Laurissenses state that \"Widochindis rebellis\" was the only Saxon who did not submit to the Franks in 777 . Widukind incited another revolt in 778 while King Charles was campaigning in Spain, but was defeated near Leisa on the river Eder . The Annales Laurissenses record that Charles I King of the Franks sent his missus \"Amelwinum\" to besiege \"Widochindum et Abbionem\" in 785, that they surrendered and were baptised at \"Attiniacum villa\" . Adam of Bremen records that \"Widichind\" surrendered and accepted baptism in 785 . m ([775]) GEVA, sister of SIGURD first \"King of Haithabu\", daughter of --- ([755]-). This marriage is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln in the outline genealogy of a family referred to as \"Kings of Haithabu\", doubts about which are discussed in chapter 1 of the document DENMARK KINGS. The primary source on which it is based has not been identified. Widukind & his wife had one child:\n\na) WICHBERT (-after 25 Dec 834). \"Wibreht\" is named as son of Widukind in the Translatio Sancti Alexandri . The Historia Angariensis records that Wigbertus filius Witikindi built ecclesiam apud Waltingohusen, with the support of coniuge Godrada, dated 823 . Wibrathti...ac filius eius Waldbertus donated property to Utrecht St Marten by charter dated 25 Dec 834 . m ODRAD [Godrada], daughter of ---. She is named with her husband in the charter dated 17 Oct 872 under which [her son] Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad . The Historia Angariensis records that Wigbertus filius Witikindi built ecclesiam apud Waltingohusen, with the support of coniuge Godrada, dated 823 . Wigbert & his wife had one child:\n\ni) WALTBERT (-876, bur Wildeshausen). Wibrathti...ac filius eius Waldbertus donated property to Utrecht St Marten by charter dated 25 Dec 834 . Ekkehard names \"Waltbertum\" as the son of \"Wigbertus\" . He is presumably the same Waltbert whose county is referred to in the charter dated 25 Apr 859 under which Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks donated property \"quas Folcheri fidelis noster actemus in beneficium tenuit in ducatu Uuestfalorum, coniacentes in pagis Grainga et Threcuuiti nec non in comitatibus Burchardi, Uualtberti, et Albrici atque Letti\" to Kloster Herford . He and his wife founded Kloster Wildeshausen. \"Ludowicus rex\" granted protection and privileges to Kloster Wildeshausen founded by \"Waldbrecht comes suique filii Wicberti\" by charter dated 20 Oct [871] . Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad, and donated property for the benefit of filius meus primogenitus Wibertus...clericatus officio and filius fratris sui...sororis, by charter dated 17 Oct 872 . The Historia Angariensis records that Walbertus filius Wigberti et Godrade, cum conthorali Altburge confirmed ecclesiam...apud Waltingohusen, with the support of coniuge Godrada, dated 872 . The Historia Angariensis records that Walbertus died in 876 and was buried in eclesia Waltingohusen . m ALDBURG, daughter of --- (-880). Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad, and donated property for the benefit of filius meus primogenitus Wibertus...clericatus officio, by charter dated 17 Oct 872 . The Historia Angariensis records that Walbertus filius Wigberti et Godrade, cum conthorali Altburge confirmed ecclesiam...apud Waltingohusen, with the support of coniuge Godrada, dated 872 . The Historia Angariensis records that Altburgis died in 880 . Waltbert & his wife had four children:\n\n(a) WICHBERT (-[908]). \"Ludowicus rex\" granted protection and privileges to Kloster Wildeshausen founded by \"Waldbrecht comes suique filii Wicberti\" by charter dated 20 Oct [871] . Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad, and donated property for the benefit of filius meus primogenitus Wibertus...clericatus officio and filius fratris sui...sororis, by charter dated 17 Oct 872 . Bishop of Verden 874-[908].\n\n(b) son . m ---. One child:\n\n(1) son . Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad, and donated property for the benefit of filius meus primogenitus Wibertus...clericatus officio and filius fratris sui...sororis, by charter dated 17 Oct 872 .\n\n(c) ELIMAR (-after 882). The Historia Angariensis records that Elimarus Waltberti filius built castrum quod posteri vocant antiquum dated 882 .\n\n(d) daughter . Waltbertus comes...et coniux mea Altburg built Wildeshausen church, for the souls of genitoris genitricisque mee...Wiberti et Odrad, and donated property for the benefit of filius meus primogenitus Wibertus...clericatus officio and filius fratris sui...sororis, by charter dated 17 Oct 872 .\n\n1. ABO [Abbi] (-after 811). The Annales Laurissenses record that Charles I King of the Franks sent his missus \"Amelwinum\" to besiege \"Widochindum et Abbionem\" in 785, that they surrendered and were baptised at \"Attiniacum villa\" . It is not known if Abo was related to Widukind but it is assumed that both had similar leadership status in Saxony. Einhard's Annales record \"Abo comes\" as one of the signatories of peace with the Vikings in 811 .\n\n1. --- (-before 908). The name of the husband of Mathilde is not known but, if the chronicler Widukind is to be believed, he was a descendant of Duke Widukind . This appears corroborated by the transmission of the name Widukind to his grandson. If this is correct, from a chronological point of view it is likely that he was the great-grandson of Widukind. m MATHILDE, daughter of --- (-911 or after). The mother of \"Thietrici comitis\" is named \"abbatissa Mahthild\" in the Vita Mathildis Reginæ, which specifies that she was abbess at Herford . According to Grote , she was recorded as abbess in 908 and 911 but the primary sources on which this is based have not so far been identified. Mathilde & her husband had one child:\n\na) THEODERIC (-8 Nov 917 ) . Widukind names \"Thiadrici\" as father of Queen Mathilde, specifying that the family was \"stirpis magni ducis Widukindi\" . The father of Queen Mathilde is named \"Thietricus\" in the Vita Mathildis Reginæ . m REGINLIND [Reinhild], daughter of --- (-11 May ----). The wife of Theoderich is named \"Reinhildam, Danorum Fresonumque germine procreatam\" in the Vita Mathildis Reginæ . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was Reinhild, daughter of Gotfrid the Dane & his wife Gisela [Carolingian], which is presumably a guess based on this description in the Vita Mathildis. However, the chronology is not ideal. Regino records the marriage in 882 of \"Gisla filia Hlotharii\" and \"rex Godofridus Nordmannorum\" . If this couple's daughter was the mother of Queen Mathilde, the latter's estimated birth date (see below) would need to be pushed forward by several years, which makes the chronology for her known descendants tight. A better fit may be Reginlind, [sister of Bovo Bishop of Chalons, daughter of ---]. The known sister of Bishop Bovo was Frederuna, wife of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the Franks. The hypothesis that there was another sister married to Theoderic would explain (1) the name Frederuna being transmitted to Regenhild's daughter, and (2) Berenger Bishop of Cambrai, recorded elsewhere as nepos of Queen Frederuna, being described as \" Ottonis imperatoris proxime consanguineus\" in the Gesta Episcoporum Cameracensium . If this is correct, the reference to Reginlind being \"Danorum Fresonumque germine procreatam\" has not been explained. A list of names in the Libri Confraternitatum Sancti Galli sets out (in order) \"Thieterich, Reginhilt, *, Oto, Amalrat, Perectheid, Friderun, Pia\", immediately after a list of family members of Heinrich I King of Germany and his wife, which no doubt refers to the latter's parents and sisters, \"Oto\" being the only person not so far identified . The list is undated but was presumably written during the period [929/36] as King Heinrich's son-in-law Duke Giselbert is included (married in [928/29]) but not his son-in-law Hugues Duc des Francs (married in 937). The necrology of Merseburg records the death \"11 May\" of \"Reinhild mater regine Mahtildis\" . Theoderic & his wife had seven children:\n\ni) WIDUKIND . Widukind names (in order) \"Widukind, Immed et Reginbern\" as brothers of Queen Mathilde .\n\nii) IMMED [I] . Widukind names (in order) \"Widukind, Immed et Reginbern\" as brothers of Queen Mathilde .\n\niii) REGINBERN . Widukind names (in order) \"Widukind, Immed et Reginbern\" as brothers of Queen Mathilde, specifying that Reginbern fought against the Danes .\n\niv) MATHILDE ([896]-Quedlinburg 14 Mar 968, bur Quedlinburg Stiftskirche) . Widukind names \"Mahthilda\" as wife of King Heinrich, also naming her father and three brothers . Thietmar names Mathilde as daughter of \"Dietrich and Reinhild\" when recording her marriage to Heinrich, and specifies that she was \"a descendant of the lineage of King Widukind\" . Her alleged descent from Widukind is also referred to in the Vita Mahthildis . Thietmar records that Quedlinburg was bestowed on Mathilde as part of her dower 16 Sep 929 , and that she established the convent there thirty days after the death of her husband . Lay Abbess of Nivelles. The necrology of Fulda records the death \"968 II Id Mar\" of \"Mahthild regina\" . m (Wallhausen 909) as his second wife, HEINRICH Graf, son of OTTO \"der Erlauchte\" Graf im Südthüringau & his wife Hedwig [Babenberg] ([876]-Memleben 2 Jul 936, bur Quedlinburg Stiftskirche). He was elected as HEINRICH I \"der Vogelsteller/the Fowler\" King of Germany at Fritzlar 6 May 919.\n\nv) AMALRADA ([7 Sep] ----) . A list of names in the Libri Confraternitatum Sancti Galli sets out (in order) \"Thieterich, Reginhilt, *, Oto, Amalrat, Perectheid, Friderun, Pia\", immediately after a list of family members of Heinrich I King of Germany and his wife, which no doubt refers to the latter's parents and sisters . The Vita Domni Deoderici Episcopi Maioris names \"Amelrada\" as wife of \"comite Everardo\", sister of \"Mathildis reginæ filiæ Thiadrici ducis\", and she and her husband as parents of \"Deodericum ex pago Saxoniæ Hamalant\" . The necrology of Gorze records the death \"VII Id Sep\" of \"Amarrada comitissa\" . m EBERHARD, son of [EBERHARD Graf im Keldachgau und im Bonngau [Ezzonen] & his wife ---] (-[3 Sep] before 964). Graaf van Drenthe en Salland.\n\nvi) FREDERUNA (-18 Jan 971) . Thietmar refers to \"Counts Wichmann and Ekbert brothers\" as sons of Emperor Otto I's maternal aunt , but does not name their mother. A list of names in the Libri Confraternitatum Sancti Galli sets out (in order) \"Thieterich, Reginhilt, *, Oto, Amalrat, Perectheid, Friderun, Pia\", immediately after a list of family members of Heinrich I King of Germany and his wife, which no doubt refers to the latter's parents and sisters . It is also possible that the wife of Wichmann [II] was the sister Bia, unless she can be identified as the mother of Friedrich (see below). The necrology of Fulda records the death \"970 Id Jan\" of \"Fridarun comitissa [anc Christi]\" , presumably showing that she became a nun before she died. m WICHMANN [II], son of BILLUNG & his wife --- (-23 Apr 944).\n\nvii) BIA [Pia] (-25 May ----) A list of names in the Libri Confraternitatum Sancti Galli sets out (in order) \"Thieterich, Reginhilt, *, Oto, Amalrat, Perectheid, Friderun, Pia\", immediately after a list of family members of Heinrich I King of Germany and his wife, which no doubt refers to the latter's parents and sisters . \"Otto rex\" granted property \"in Gereslevo in pago Svevia in comitatu Crhistiani\" on the request of \"Friderici fidelis nostri\" to \"nobili matronæ Biæ ipsius matri\" by charter dated 21 Oct 937, in consultation with \"Burchardi, Ebarhardi, Chuonradi, Heinrici atque Utonis comitum\" , although it is not known whether this was the same Bia. The necrology of Merseburg records the death \"25 May\" of \"Bia soror regine Mahtildis\" . same person as ? BIA (-after 21 Oct 937). \"Otto rex\" granted property \"in Gereslevo in pago Svevia in comitatu Crhistani\" to \"nobili matronæ Bia ipsius matri\" at the request of \"Friderici fidelis nostri\" by charter dated 21 Oct 937 . It is not certain that this refers to the same person as Bia, daughter of Theoderic, but this is likely to be the case. No other noble lady of this name has been identified around the date of this charter, and \"matrona\" is the term usually applied to members of the high nobility. The wording of the charter suggests that Bia's husband had died before the date of the grant. m --- (-before 21 Oct 937). The name of Bia's husband is not known. Bia & her husband had one child:\n\n(a) FRIEDRICH (-after 21 Oct 937). \"Otto rex\" granted property \"in Gereslevo in pago Svevia in comitatu Crhistani\" to \"nobili matronæ Bia ipsius matri\" at the request of \"Friderici fidelis nostri\" by charter dated 21 Oct 937 .\n\n1. IMMED [II] (-killed in battle 954). Immed [II] is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the possible father of Waldered and Immed [III] . His date of death (the source for which has not been identified) is consistent with his having been the same person as Immed, son of Theoderic and Reginlind (see above). Widukind records that Meinwerk Bishop of Paderborn (the supposed grandson of Immed [III], see below) was \"paterno genere a Thiedrico Mathilde reginæ fratre\" . It is possible that \"Thiedrico\" in this source is an error for \"Immed\", as this is the only reference to Queen Mathilde having a brother named Theoderich. As will be seen below, it has not been possible to corroborate many of the dates relating to his supposed descendants, as shown in the same table in Europäische Stammtafeln, against primary sources. Ymmadus comes donated property in Lithingi, in pago --- to Corvey monastery, witnessed by Thuring comes, Amalung comes  . m ---. The name of Immed's wife is not known. Immed [II] & his wife had [two possible children]:\n\na) [WALDERED . [984]. m BERTHA, sister of BURKHARD Graf im Liesgau, daughter of ---. [984]. The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified. Waldered & his wife had three children:\n\ni) DIETRICH [Theoderich] (-[6 Mar] 995) . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not so far been identified.

The Vita Meinwerci names \"uxorem de terra Saxoniæ, Athelam nomine\" as wife of Immed . Widukind records that Meinwerk Bishop of Paderborn was \"materno a Wichmanno, Herimanni ducis nepote, propinquo Ottonis I\" . Alpertus names \"Adela sorori domnæ Liutgardæ\", commenting that Adela was \"clamosa in voce, lasciva in verbis, veste composite, animo dissoluta\", the subsequent paragraph recording that, after her sister died, Adela took all her property which she had intended for the church before \"vidua lasciva\" married Baldric as her second husband . She married secondly (before 996) Baldric Count in Drenthe. \"Otto Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed the rights and privileges of Kloster Elten naming \"filiam Lutgardam abbatissam [et] filia Adela [et] Baldericus maritus Adele\" by charter dated 18 Dec 996 . The wife of \"Baldericus\" was the daughter of \"Wicmanni, cuius maiores magnam partem Germaniæ et maxime circa littoral oceani imperia tenebant\" . Thietmar records that the wife of Baldric encouraged her husband to arrange for the murder of \"Count Wichmann\" in 1016 . She is named \"Adelæ uxoris Baldrici\" in a later (undated) passage recording her death . The work of Thiodericus names \"Ida comitissa eius [=Baldricus] coniunx\" (\"Ida\" presumably being an error for \"Adela\") and records her death \"11 Kal Apr\" without specifying the year . Immed [III] & his wife had five children:\n\ni) THEODERICH (-killed Upladen 7 Apr 1014). The Vita Meinwerci names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela, specifying that Theoderich succeeded his father, a later passage adding that he was killed \"VII Id Apr Uplage urbe\" on the orders of his mother .\n\nii) MEINWERK (-5/6 Jun 1036). The Vita Meinwerci names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela, specifying that Meinwerk was \"in ecclesia beati Stephani protomartiris in civitate Halverstadensi ad clericatus est oblatus\" . Canon at Halberstadt. Chaplain at the royal court and canon at St Maria, Aachen 1001/09. Bishop of Paderborn 1009.\n\niii) GLISMOD (-5 Feb before 1041) . The Vita Meinwerci names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela, specifying that Glismod married \"nobilis principis in Baioaria\" . m ---. The identity of the husband of Glismod is not known. He has been associated with Adalbert \"der Siegreiche\" Markgraf der Ostmark, son of Liutpold I Markgraf der bayerischen Ostmark, Graf im Traungau, Sundergau und Donaugau & his wife Richwara im Sualafeldgau (-26 May 1055, bur Stift Melk). The Annales Stadenses name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" . It is unlikely that this refers to Liutpold, son of Markgraf Adalbert, who was installed as Markgraf der Ungarischen Mark in Dec 1043 and died soon afterwards, presumably childless as his younger brother succeeded their father in the Markgrafschaft. [One possible child]:\n\n(a) [LIUTPOLD (-[before 1055]) . The Annales Stadenses name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" . Graf von Stade. It seems unlikely that Liutpold's mother was the same Glismod who was the daughter of Immed. As the Immed died in 983, as it is likely that his daughter's children would have been born [1000/15]. If Liutpold was one of these children, he would have been considerably older than his wife. m as her first husband, IDA von Elstorf, daughter of [LIUDOLF Markgraf in Friesland [Braunschweig] & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim] (-before 4 May 1082). The Annales Stadenses name \"Ida nobilis femina de Suevia nata, in villa Elsthorpe\" as daughter of \"fratris imp. Heinrici III, filia sororis Leonis papa qui et Bruno\" . It is probable that Ida was the daughter of Liudolf, who is the only known [half-]brother of Emperor Heinrich III whose wife is not otherwise recorded in other primary sources. Elstorf is located west of Hamburg near Buxtehude, south-east of Stade. No other reference has been found in primary sources to Elstorf being linked to any medieval noble family. The significance of von Elstorf in this extract from the Annales Stadenses has not been ascertained. In particular it is not known whether it represents property held by Ida from her paternal or maternal family or through one of her husbands. The Annales Stadenses name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\", specifying that they were parents of \"Odam sanctimonialem de Rinthelen\" .] Liutpold & his wife had two children:\n\n(1) ODA (-after 1052) . The Annales Stadenses name \"Odam sanctimonialem de Rinthelen\" as daughter of \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" and \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\", specifying that she married \"regi Ruzie\" by whom she had a son \"Warteslaw\", returned to Saxony with her son after her husband died, and there became the mother of \"filiam Aliarinam, matrem comitis Burchardi de Lucken\" who later killed \"lantgravius Hermannus de Wincenburg\", although a later passage specifies that Ida was mother of \"Akarinam matrem Burchardi de Lucken\" . It has not been possible to verify all this information. Baumgarten identifies her first husband as Vladimir Iaroslavich . The chronology of Oda, daughter of Ida von Elstorf, bearing a son by a husband who died in 1052 is difficult to sustain. It is suggested that Odas supposed first marriage should be viewed with considerable scepticism. [m firstly [VLADIMIR Iaroslavich, son of IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev & his [second] wife Ingigerd Olafsdottir of Sweden (1020-Novgorod 1052, bur Novgorod Church of St Sophia).] m [secondly] ---.\n\n(2) EKBERT (-murdered Wickstadt, near Elstorf [before 1082]). The Annales Stadenses records that Ida [von Elstorf] had \"filium Ecbertum comitem\" who was killed by \"primus Udo marchio...cognatus suus\" at Wistede prope Elstorpe, adding that Ida found herself without heirs (orbata heredibus), visited avunculum suum papam Leonem (therefore before Apr 1054), and following his recommendation adopted ipsum Udonem as her son and appointed him as her heir (listing properties which she granted him during her lifetime), a later passage clarifying that predictum Udonem marchionem primum was Idas successor after she died (Ida ergo mortua...) . This text presents chronological difficulties. A literal interpretation of primus Udo marchio would indicate Lothar Udo [II] Graf von Stade (see the document SAXONY NOBILITY), who succeeded as Markgraf der Nordmark in 1056 and died the following year so could not have been appointed by Ida as her heir. Presumably therefore his son Lothar Udo [III], who succeeded his father as Lothar Udo II Markgraf der Nordmark and died in 1082, was intended. However, that interpretation is inconsistent with Ida von Elstorf taking advice from her uncle Pope Leo IX (who died in Apr 1054). That part of the report must be factually incorrect, the only safe conclusion being that Ekbert predeceased his mother some time before 1082. The appointment by Ekberts mother of his killer as her heir suggests that the killing was accidental.\n\niv) ADELA (-after 1027). The Vita Meinwerci names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed and Athela, specifying that Azela became a nun at \"ecclesia martiris Viti Eltene\" . Canoness at Elten.\n\nv) EMMA (-3 Dec 1038, bur Bremen Cathedral) . The Vita Meinwerci names \"Emma\" wife of \"comes Liutderus\", but does not give her origin . Her parentage is confirmed by Adam of Bremen who names \"Emma\" as wife of \"Liudgerus frater [Benno dux Saxonum]\" when recording her husband's death in 1011, calling her \"Emma soror Meginwerki episcopi Padarburnensis\" when recording her death and her burial in Bremen Cathedral . m LIUTGER, son of HERMANN Billung Duke in Saxony & his [first/second] wife [Oda ---/Hildesuit ---] (-1011).\n\n1.

The commentary in the printed text interprets this as \"granddaughter of Heinrich I King of Germany\", but this is chronologically impossible assuming that the approximate death date of Wundelgart's husband is correct. If there is any truth in the text, it is more likely that Wundelgart was the niece of King Heinrich by his sister, although this is far from certain considering the broad range of interpretation possible for the word \"neptis\". However, the chronology is tight even for this interpretation, as shown by the estimated birth date range of this daughter, which must mean that she was one of her parents' older children. Another possibility is that she was illegitimate. The same source in a later passage names \"Ekkehardo diacono et Purchardo puero post abate consobrinis suis\" . As Wundelgart was the mother of abbot Burkhard, this gives the essential clue about the name of this daughter's husband, who in the same source is named as the father of the sisters who were mothers of the younger Ekkehard and abbot Burkhard. m as his first wife, EKKEHARD [I], son of ---.]\n\n2.

ORIGINS\n\nThe ancestral home of the Billung family was around Lüneburg. Otto I King of Germany appointed Hermann Billung as Markgraf in the northern part of the new \"east March\" which was created to protect northern Germany from Slav attacks from the east. Less aggressive than Gero, his counterpart in the southern part of the March (see the document MEISSEN), Hermann directed his attacks mainly against the Vagrians and Obotrites . The family's power increased as a result of Hermann's appointment to represent the king in Saxony on many occasions . Hermann's descendants accumulated extensive territories in north-eastern Saxony on the middle Weser and acquired numerous church advocacies. The residence of the Billung dukes remained at Lüneburg . They had less influence in western Saxony, and even after bearing the title \"dux\" it is hardly appropriate to describe the title-holders as dukes \"of Saxony\", the title being more a reflection of the personal power of the title-holder than of his territorial possessions. The Billung dukes had no right to summon vassals to appear at court or on the battlefield, in contrast to the power exercised for example by the dukes of Bavaria. Neither do they appear to have exercised any special ducal rights of jurisdiction over the more powerful local counts, for example the counts of Stade who created extensive domains for themselves between the lower Elbe and the Weser . The three eastern border provinces of Nordmark, Lausitz and Meissen, which came into existence towards the end of the 12th century, were imperial fiefs with no vassal status towards the Billung dukes . On the extinction of the male line of the Billung family in 1106, the ducal title was awarded to Lothar von Süpplingenburg, although the Billung family territories were inherited by the sons-in-law of the last duke, the Welf Duke Heinrich \"der Schwarze\" and Otto von Ballenstedt.\n\nOnomastics suggest a family connection between the family of the founders of Brunswick and the Billung family, as well as with the family of Otto I King of Germany, but any such relationship cannot be proved. As will be seen below, there is considerable uncertainty about the early generations of this family, in particular the supposed descendants of Count Wichmann [II]. However, the suggested relationships set out here appear to be reasonably robust.\n\n1. AMELUNG (-before 1 Dec 811). m ---. The name of Amelung's wife is not known.

It is not known which family Hermann belonged to. However, the other deaths recorded in the same source are of the first counts of Brunswick, who are probably descended from the Billung family as shown below.

He was given military command in Saxony (\"princeps militiæ\") by Otto I King of Germany in 936, which triggered the revolt of his brother Wichmann . Graf in Wetigau 940.

The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names \"Mathildis, filiam principis Herimanni\" as wife of \"Balduinum [filius comitis Arnulfi]\", specifying that it was hoped that the couple would have many children . This suggests that their marriage date may have been some years earlier than 961 considering that the Genealogia was supposedly compiled in [951/59], probably during the earlier part of this date range considering which children of Louis IV King of the West Franks are named in the document . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Mathildis comitissa Saxonie\" as wife of \"Godefridi Ardennensis\" . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed the rights and property of Kloster Mouzon donated by (among others) \"dux Fredericus pro anima Ottonis [et] Godefridus comes et coniux sua Mathildis pro anima sui fratris Adalberonis archiepiscopi\" by charter dated 1023 .

Her birth date range is estimated on the basis of her sister being born in [942] and Schwanehilde herself giving birth to seven children by her second husband.

The primary source which confirms her parentage has not so far been identified. Nun at Herford. 995.\n\n4. [BRUNO ([905/15]-after 16 Nov 958, maybe after 30 Dec 979). There is no proof that Bruno was the brother of Hermann Billung but this looks probable. It is assumed that Bruno's sons were adolescent or young adults when mentioned with their father in the two sources referred to below. This would place Bruno's birth in the range [905/15], which is too early for him to have been the son of Wichmann [II]. The reference to \"pago Derlingum\" in the [951/57] charter is a clear indication of a family connection as this territory appears several times in documents in which the supposed descendants of Wichmann [II] are named (see below). \"Otto rex\" granted property \"Hebesheim in pago Derlingum in comitatu Brunonis\" to Moritzkirche, Magdeburg by undated charter, but dated to [951/57] as it names \"coniugis nostræ Aelheidis filii nostri Liudolfi\", in the presence of \"eiusdem Brunonis comitis filiique Liudolfi, Geronis marchionis, Cristiani comitis nec non Liutharii et Friderici comitum\" . \"Otto rex\" gave property \"in pago Hessi in comitatu comitis qui dicitur Bern in loco Uuestnetri\" which \"ibidem Bruninc comes filiusque eius Amalunc in beneficium habere visi sunt\" to \"fideli nostro Retolt\" by charter dated 16 Nov 958 . \"Otto imperator augustus\" gave judgment in a dispute between Werner Abbot of Fulda and Gozbert Abbot of Hersfeld, concerning ship travel along the Hörsel, by charter dated 30 Dec 979, which names \"comites nostros Sigebertum, Sigefridum et Brunonem\" , although if this refers to the same Count Bruno he would have been very old at the time. m ---. The name of Bruno's wife is not known.] Bruno & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) LIUDOLF (-after [951/57]). \"Otto rex\" granted property \"Hebesheim in pago Derlingum in comitatu Brunonis\" to Moritzkirche, Magdeburg by undated charter, but dated to [951/57] as it names \"coniugis nostræ Aelheidis filii nostri Liudolfi\", in the presence of \"eiusdem Brunonis comitis filiique Liudolfi, Geronis marchionis, Cristiani comitis nec non Liutharii et Friderici comitum\" .\n\nb) AMELUNG (-after 958). \"Otto rex\" gave property \"in pago Hessi in comitatu comitis qui dicitur Bern in loco Uuestnetri\" which \"ibidem Bruninc comes filiusque eius Amalunc in beneficium habere visi sunt\" to \"fideli nostro Retolt\" by charter dated 16 Nov 958 . Ymmadus comes donated property in Lithingi, in pago --- to Corvey monastery, witnessed by Thuring comes, Amalung comes  .\n\n5. [son . The identity of the husband of Gerberga is unknown. The name of his son, Wichmann, suggests a close family relationship with the Billung family of dukes of Saxony. The connection appears confirmed by Widukind who records that Meinwerk Bishop of Paderborn was \"materno a Wichmanno, Herimanni ducis nepote, propinquo Ottonis I\" , the bishop's mother being corroborated in other sources as Adela, daughter of Wichmann [V]. There are so many uncertainties regarding the genealogy of the Billung family that detailed speculation on any precise relationship does not seem worthwhile. Gerberga's husband is shown as a possible son of Billung only for the purposes of making the hyperlink connection. m GERBERGA, daughter of MEGINHARD Graf van Hamaland & his wife ---. Her parentage is confirmed by the Necrologium of Elten which records the death of \"Meginhard, pater Gerberch, cuius filius Wichmannus comes fundator ecclesia\" . One child:\n\na) WICHMANN [V] ([930]-after 27 Sep 979) . His parentage is confirmed by the Necrologium of Elten which records the death of \"Meginhard, pater Gerberch, cuius filius Wichmannus comes fundator ecclesia\" . Graaf van Hamaland.\n\n- GRAVEN van HAMALAND.\n\n6. [---. m ---.]\n\na) [daughter . Alpertus names \"Godizo, Richizonis filius\" as \"consanguineus\" of the sisters Liutgard and Adela . This would be explained if, as shown here, their father Wichmann [V] was the son of an otherwise unknown brother of Duke Hermann Billung (see above) and Richizo's wife was also related to the duke's family although the precise nature of this relationship is speculation. m RICHIZO, son of ---.]\n\nWICHMANN [II], son of BILLUNG & his wife --- (-23 Apr 944) . Widukind names \"Wichmanni fratris sui [=Herimannum]\", when recording his rebellion against King Otto . \"Otto rex\" granted property \"in pago Vnimoti in comitatu Wigmanni dua loca Vrlaha et Ottingha\" for the foundation of Magdeburg by charter dated 11 Oct 937 . He rebelled against Otto I King of Germany in 938, dissatisfied that the king had given military command in Saxony to his brother Hermann, but made peace with the king later the same year . The Annales Magdeburgenses record the reconciliation of \"Wigmannus frater Hermanni Saxonis ducis\" and the king in 941 . The necrology of Fulda records the death in 944 of \"Wigman com\" . The necrology of Lüneburg records the death \"23 Apr\" of \"Wigmam com\" .\n\nm FREDERUNA, daughter of Graf THEODERICH [Immedinger] & his wife Reginlind --- (-18 Jan 971). Her origin is deduced from Thietmar referring to \"Counts Wichmann and Ekbert brothers\" as sons of Emperor Otto I's maternal aunt , although he does not name their mother. A list of names in the Libri Confraternitatum Sancti Galli sets out (in order) \"Thieterich, Reginhilt, *, Oto, Amalrat, Perectheid, Friderun, Pia\", immediately after a list of family members of Heinrich I King of Germany and his wife, which no doubt refers to the latter's parents and sisters . It is also possible that the wife of Wichmann [I] was the sister Bia, unless she can be identified as the mother of Friedrich (see above). The necrology of Fulda records the death \"970 Id Jan\" of \"Fridarun comitissa [anc Christi]\" , presumably showing that she became a nun before she died.\n\nWichmann [II] & his wife had [four possible children]:\n\n1. [WICHMANN [III] (-killed in battle 22 Sep 967). Thietmar records that \"Count Wichmann\" took part in the siege of Mainz during the rebellion of Liudolf, son of Emperor Otto I, in 953 . No direct proof has been found that Wichmann [III] was the son of Wichmann [II]. However, it is clear that Wichmann [III] was the brother of Ekbert \"der Einäugige\", as in a later passage Thietmar refers to \"Counts Wichmann and Ekbert brothers\" instigating the Slavs to war . Wichmann revived his supposed father's feud with his uncle Hermann Billung, was captured in [953] and not included in the general settlement of 954 . He was \"the outlaw Count Wichman\", under whose leadership \"the Slavs\" (probably the Pomeranians) defeated Mieszko I Prince of Poland twice in 963 . Widukind records that \"Misacam\" and his Bohemian allies defeated the western Pomeranians in 967 and killed their leader Wichman . Emperor Otto inherited Wichmann's land, presumably by confiscation, and divided the inheritance into two parts, one of which he granted to the monastery constructed at Lüneburg by Hermann Billung, the other to the abbey \"que dicitur Keminada iuxta Wisarum fluvium\" . The necrology of Lüneburg records the death \"22 Sep\" of \"Wichmannus comes et multi aliis occisi\" .] same person as ? WICHMANN . The Notice concerning the foundation of Corvey lists \"Wicmannus comes Dungon, Hatuwih comitissa Beverunge, Heremannus Mylenhusen\" among the donors to the monastery (undated) . Reading this together with the entry for Graf Amelung and his mother Hathwig, it appears probable that the latter was the wife of Wichmann, that both were parents of Amelung, and that Wichmann was the same person as Wichmann [III], but none of this is certain. m HATHWIG, daughter of ---. The Notice concerning the foundation of Corvey lists \"Amulung comes Bikethop, Hathuwig mater eius Amulungessen\" among the donors to the monastery (undated) . Wichmann & his wife had one child:\n\na) AMELUNG . The Notice concerning the foundation of Corvey lists \"Amulung comes Bikethop, Hathuwig mater eius Amulungessen\" among the donors to the monastery (undated) .\n\n2. [BRUNO ([920/25]-[26 Jan] 976). Monk at Corvey before 942. \"Bruno Corbeiensis monachus\", \"cognatus\" of Hermann Billung Duke in Saxony, was appointed to succeed Amelung (brother of Hermann Billung) as Bishop of Verden in 962 . No direct indication has been found that Bruno was the son of Wichmann [II]. However, the chronology is favorable. Thietmar records the death of Duke Hermann, father of Bernhard, at Quedlinburg on 1 Apr, the transportation of his body to Lüneburg, and the refusal by Bruno Bishop of Verden (maybe his nephew) to allow his burial in church because of his prior excommunication .]\n\n3. [EKBERT [I] \"der Einäugige\" ([930/35]-4 Apr 994). No direct proof has been found that Ekbert [I] was the son of Wichmann [II] but the chronology is favorable. However, it is clear that he was the brother of Wichmann [III], as Thietmar refers to \"Counts Wichmann and Ekbert brothers\" instigating the Slavs to war . His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that he was of a similar age to Liudolf, son of Emperor Otto I, when he joined Liudolf's rebellion. Ekbert lost an eye in a battle for which he blamed Emperor Otto I . \"Otto rex\" confirmed the immunities of Kloster Essen including over land \"excepta in loco Ruoldinghus quam Eggihart et eius coniunx Rikilt\" possessed by hereditary right and in land \"in comitatu Ecberti et Cobbonis\" by charter dated 15 Jan 947 , although Ekbert [I] would have been rather young at that date for this to be the same person. Thietmar records that \"Count Ekbert\" joined the rebellion of Liudolf, son of Emperor Otto I , dated from other sources to [953/54]. \"Otto imperator augustus\" made a donation to St Pantaleon at Köln of property \"insule medietatem in Almere que Urch vocatur quod Gardolfus iam quondam comes tenuisse in comitatu Ekberti comitis\" by an undated charter, dated to 966 . Thietmar records that \"Count Ekbert\" was tried for complicity in the rebellion of Heinrich Duke of Bavaria and sent into exile , dated to 978.

He is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the brother of Wichmann [IV] Graf im Duffelgau and Ekbert Graf im Derlingau, while another table shows Wichmann [IV] as son of Ekbert \"der Einäugige\" . His birth date range is estimated from his estimated marriage date. Bruno founded Braunschweig.

Alpertus records that, in the conflict between \"Wicmannus et Baldericus\", Baldric received the support of \"Coloniensis sacerdotis itemque Gerhardi Mosellensis, potentis viri\" while Wichmann was supported by the king . Thietmar records that \"Count Wichmann\" intervened to prevent Duke Bernhard being granted the island called Parey after the murder in Nov 1014 of Werner von Walbeck ex-Markgraf der Nordmark .

Wichmann's wife is named \"Remmod\" in Europäische Stammtafeln but the basis for this is not known.] Wichmann [IV] & his wife had one son:\n\ni) son (-after Oct 1016).

Thietmar names \"Hathui niece of Queen Mathilde\", records her marriage to \"Siegfried son of Markgraf Gero\" when aged 13, and that she became a nun after her husband's death . There is no proof that she was the daughter of Wichmann [II] but the latter's wife is the most likely of the sisters of Queen Mathilde who could have been Hedwig's mother. It should also be noted that Thietmar records the death of \"my cousin Mathilde\" on 28 Apr 1014, noting that \"she had long resided at Gernrode with Abbess Hathui to whom she was related by blood\" . If Hathui was the daughter of Wichmann [II], she would have been the first cousin of Mathilde's supposed father Duke Bernhard.

It is not certain to whom \"Angelberti marchionis\" refers, but it is possible that it is Engelbert [I] Graf von Sponheim whose father was Markgraf. Wegener points out that a Saxon origin for Engelbert is consistent with the introduction of the names Bernhard and Heinrich into the family of the Grafen von Sponheim . However, if she was the daughter of Duke Bernhard, she must have been born in the range [1020/40]. This seems early in light of the known career dates of Engelbert [I]'s children.
