by QUEEN AMALIE OF SAXONY

QUEEN AMALIE AUGUSTE (1801-1877). Amalie was a Princess of Bavaria, the daughter of King Maximilian I, and Queen of Saxony. Amalie married King John of Saxony in 1822, and they had nine children, including the future King Albert of Saxony.ALS. 1pg. N.d. [circa 1853-1854]. N.p. [likely Dresden]. An autograph letter signed A by Queen Amalie of Saxony. Responding to a prior correspondence, Amalie discusses her recent poor health and a visit from her oldest son Albert and his wife Karola. The letter is written on both sides of an envelope and is accompanied by an English translation on a separate sheet: Dear Therese, Pardon me that I have no yet answered your first letter & that I only today reply to the last. I was very miserable & have trouble to recover my strength. I think you heartily for your sympathies in our joy to have Albert with us again. It will unfortunately not last long, as he leaves already Thursday & takes Karola with him which will be for me a great sacrifice. I hope you are well again! It is to be hoped I shall soon be able to see you. Entirely yours A. The translation is accompanied by a brief gloss: Translation of Queens letter. Albert is her son & Karola is his wife. Amlie gave me this literal translation. The recipient of the letter was likely Amalies sister-in-law Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1792-1854), who became Queen of Bavaria through her marriage to Amalies oldest brother Ludwig I. It is unclear who wrote the translation and gloss. The letter is in fine condition. (Inventory #: 3445)
