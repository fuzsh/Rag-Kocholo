        "text": "Coverage\n\nPress release on PR NewsWire.\n\nInside Higher Ed - \"Although there are numerous remaining proprietary players, including eCollege, as well as an emerging cadre of open source platforms for course management, such as Moodle and Sakai, the combined Blackboard/WebCT entity is likely to control as much as two-thirds of the e-learning market, says Burdt of Eduventures.\"\n\nScott Leslie - has a comprehensive report that is spot-on. \"It's not totally our fault - yes, the specs were a moving target for a long time. Yes, compliance testing likely means a load of liability insurance that no one can afford. Yes, there are good reasons to accept that the specs need to be able to be extended to accommodate things they couldn't do in their original incarnations. But we've accepted all of these excuses and what do we have? Instead of content interoperability and portability between systems, we basically have vendor lock in, the very thing the freaking specs were supposed to help avoid! And that just got a world worse too with this consolidation.\"\n\nMotley Fool (will annoy you with a login redirect - hit the back button, then the forward button to read). \"The merger, in my book, rates no more than a B-minus. The combined companies' 3,700 clients will be one clear benefit -- the merged company's base of annual software licensing fees will far surpass that of competitor eCollege.com.\"\n\nChronicle of Higher Education - \"They really are two powerhouses,\" said Catherine F. Burdt, lead analyst for postsecondary solutions for Eduventures Inc., a market-research company based in Boston. \"This company will come together to create a big powerhouse.\" But that doesn't necessarily mean Blackboard will squash all its competition, she said. Another software company, eCollege, is still a big player in course management, and there are several smaller competitors, including Angel, Desire2Learn, and Intralearn, she said. \"They'll now only have to keep their eye on one big competitor,\" she said.\n\nXplanaZine weighs in with an article and podcast. \"If ever there was a marriage made in history, this has got to be it.\"\n\nNew! Inside Higher Ed - Blackboard vs....? - \"many are skeptical of Blackboard's pledges to continue to offer and support WebCT products. That's not because they necessarily distrust Blackboard, but because of a pattern in which such promises are frequently made by technology companies, post-merger, and abandoned a few months later.\"\n\nNew! Information Today - \"The acquisition will create the largest e-learning company in the field with more than 3,700 customers, including colleges and universities and corporate and government clients. The merged company will be headquartered in Washington, D.C. The combined company would have approximately 800 employees in seven offices in the U.S., Canada, and abroad.\"\n\nNew! Desire2Learn responds to the merger - You Can Decide TODAY What Your CMS/VLE of Tomorrow Will Be. - \"Desire2Learn wishes to seek the advice and opinions of our clients and potential clients that have comments, questions, and/or concerns about this recent event and the increased growth opportunity for Desire2Learn.\"\n\nEdubloggers React\n\nBrian Lamb - There's only a Technorati breeze blowing right now, but I suspect it will be a gale soon enough -- Blackboard has acquired WebCT (they call it a merger, you decide). I can't say I have much to add to the general chorus of disbelief and confusion... although there is a certain inescapable logic to the process, it seems to have taken everyone by surprise.\n\nIt will be interesting to observe how the open source community responds to the new reality. And will a Microsoft of the LMS provoke a broader backlash on campuses? I suspect there will be a lot of overtime being put in by the marketing types.\n\nAs it happens, I will be in Orlando during the press conference they have scheduled for October 18th, though I won't be blogging it live (oh darn). I'm going to be co-delivering a preconference seminar on portfolios and social software. So I will even miss the \"mergercast\" (doesn't that term inspire confidence?)...\n\nD'Arcy Norman - Larry Johnson just sent an email to the NMC list with news that Blackboard and WebCT are merging. Holy. Crap. I mean - there goes any sense of competition in the LMS game. WhatÃ¯Â¿Â½s left to compete? Moodle? Sakai? Something else? I really hope there is more than one Big Player left in the LMS world...\n\nHereÃ¯Â¿Â½s hoping the new LMS behemoth doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t go all Microsoft on our asses, and is able to do something innovative with their new collective girth.\n\nLooks like Bb and WebCT brands will continue for some time, with the best of both being amalgamated into a new Bb version. BbCT?\n\nI, for one, welcome our new LMS overlords...\n\nNancy White - Oh, dear gods and goddesses of learning, please tell me that this does not mean more gets locked behind large and (at least in the past) inflexible systems that lack the graceful bend of a willow in the wind???\n\nScott Leslie - Well, there goes any claim to being an insider! Just found out about this a few minutes ago and had no idea it was in the works. I believe this is true as I am sitting on the analysts conference call right now. You kind of knew something like this had to happen, but still it's profoundly shocking now that it has, especially as WebCT is just pushing WebCT Campus Edition 6 out the door in the last few months, which meant it was no longer supporting 2 code bases. Somewhat unsurprisingly, it was referred to as an 'acquisition' a number of times, which seems really like what it is.\n\nOn the analysts call the first piece of work that was identified to bring the two products closer together was unifying an API for the Blackboard and WebCT.\n\nSo, what does that mean for things like the IMS Tools Interoperability Profile? Well, seems to me like the new unified API becomes a de facto 'standard' that will be even harder to displace for any of the more open approaches to integrating 3rd party tools into CMS.\n\nStuart Yeates - Blackboard and WebCT are to merge. From an econimic point of view, this makes little sense unless they no longer see each other as key rivals. Do they now both see Moodle as their key rival? Or Bodington?\n\nMichelle Chua - So the Pepsi and Coke of the edtech universe are merging.\n\nI know the WebCT name survived one acquisition, but I don't think it will survive this time. \"The company will remain under the Blackboard brand.\" It's not \"taking on\" the Blackboard brand. It remains, it always was the Blackboard brand. And all the announcements are on the Blackboard website.\n\nNot that I'm trying to rub salt into the acquisition wound, but come on now -- let's call a spade a spade.\n\n(And Sakai, Moodle - remember when Wordpress made lots of noise when Movable Type moved to the turn-a-profit model? Something smells like opportunity.)\n\nJay Cross doesn't comment directly but passes on some comments \"from pals\" - Could it be that the motivation for LMS consolidation is more a belief that $1 + $1 > $2 , instead of anything directly relating to product attributes, customer opinions, complimentary products/markets or competitive forces (open source, etc)?\n\nSeems really odd Jay. The places I go and the people I meet definitely prefer WebCT to Blackboard. Most believe that Blackboard's technology is inferior. And after getting to know the WebCT management people a little bit during the past year after giving talks at their conferences and having them write a chapter in my book and having met some of the Blackboard people (who have a habit of saying no to any good idea or to say \"why don't you put that in our building blocks\" even if it hits them smack in the head), I can attest that WebCT people are a much more fun and better managed group of people. And WebCT has become profitable during past couple of years. So this seems odd. Why is Blackboard in charge? The industry is in real trouble now.\n\nCould opensource tools like Sakai and Moodle be forcing such a decision?\n\nBen Watson - Wow, consolidation is running rampart in the eLearning space as everyone continues to merge or acquire. Look to your left and look to your right; easily one of those will not be around in six months. Today BlackBoard announced plans to merge with WebCT; the two leading providers in the higher education eLearning space (BlackBoard alone forecasts US$150M+ for their fiscal year).\n\nNow having gone through a \"merger\" myself (SkillSoft and SmartForce) it sounds like BlackBoard is really acquiring WebCT and it doesn't bode well for WebCT given that there is a tremendous amount of product overlap between the two companies (a similar comparision would be if SkillSoft and NETg, the leading providers in the corporate education space, merged). It also doesn't bode well for WebCT's willingness to play with open source (sorry Harold!) If you are a WebCT employee you may want to dust off your resume with comments like this: The combined company expects to realize significant efficiencies by leveraging shared development infrastructure, and mitigating duplicative marketing initiatives and administrative expenditures.\n\nThis announcement comes on the heels of Saba acquiring Centra. Now this deal makes more sense as Saba continues evolve beyond its Learning Management Software (LMS) roots (Saba recently bought THINQ) by rounding out its services offering. Personally I like its focus on 'on-demand learning' and its Services Oriented Architecture as I think generic content is a tough business to be in. Plus Saba + Centra creates a US$100M revenue company which is not too shabby!\n\nAnd of course back in August we had WebEx buying Intranets.com and SumTotal (created out of Docent + Click2Learn) buying PathLore as I discussed in this post.\n\nClark - you need to update your Chart of Consolidations!\n\nThe Resulting Big Five: (forecasted annual revenue)\n\nSkillSoft $200M+\n\nNETg $150M-200M?\n\nBlackBoard $150M+\n\nSaba $100M+\n\nSumTotal $100M\n\n* strangely none of the investors like any of these deals as the stocks of the related companies have all dropped when they have announced their news.\n\nRick Schwier - A letter from Carol Vallone made what was a welcome and, for me anyway, surprising announcement. WebCT and Blackboard have signed a formal agreement to merge the two companies. I must admit, my first thought was whether this was a response to competition with each other, or to competition from the open source community. At any rate, those of us in universities that use either system and eschew open source products, may benefit in the long run from the improved designs promised here. At least we can hope. If not, I know where to find Moodle. Something tells me that Alec Couros and Rob Wall may have something to say about this.\n\nRob Wall - If there was ever a reason for institutions of learning, especially publicly funded ones, to run screaming at full speed away from corporate, proprietary learning content management systems and start to seriously embrace open source solutions, this is it: Press Release: BlackBoard and WebCT announce agreement to merge\n\n\"The combined CompaniesÃ¯Â¿Â½ 3,700 academic clients will create an unparalleled Community of Practice enabling collaboration and innovation around the world\"\n\nI believe the term they are looking for is not unparalleled Community of Practice, but captive market whose data is locked into our proprietary formats! See the Slashdot discussion of the BB-WebCT union for further incisive commentary.\n\nMatt Barton - Hmm. I can't say I'm really surprised, although I'm still working out how I feel about this merger. Here at St Cloud, we're using an LMS called \"Desire2Learn,\" though it's chocked full of bugs (it was designed for small Canadian schools and just doesn't seem to be handling the entire Minnesota system), so there's talk at the top of switching to something less irksome (my guess would be Blackboard).\n\nI can't help but make the analogy to Microsoft. Perhaps once Blackboard gets a good enough grip on the ed market, maybe Microsoft will step in with a me-too plus (maybe some variation of its Sharepoint Team Services).\n\nGeorge Siemens - Big news in the elearning space: WebCT and Blackboard merge I've put together a pocast of my views: My Take: WebCT and Blackboard. Slashdot dissects the merger as well.\n\nRochelle A. Mazar - In other news, Blackboard is buying WebCT. I know the whole academic blogosphere is abuzz with this news, and my jaw dropped as much as the next personÃ¯Â¿Â½s. And yes, this is going to have a huge impact on those of us involved with such systems, whether or not we are current subscribers. Is this going to provide us all with a better option when it comes to course management systems? Is it a response to some of the very cool things going on with Moodle? How will a goliath system effect the development of other open source CMS products (like Sakai)? While I will be directly effected by this move, I have no direct opinion about it, really. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not a burning fan of any current CMS, so merges and changes just make me raise my eyebrows and nod dutifully. Will it make things better? Who knows. As long as the APIs are still around, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m happy enough.\n\nChristopher D. Sessums - Could this signal the beginning of the end for corporate, one-sized-fits-all learning management systems?\n\nHas open-sourced solutions broken the giants' backs?\n\nPerhaps. Although these two mega-players control a majority of the market share, neither have been completely successful in convincing colleges and universities that their solution is the best one.\n\nCan't wait to see how this plays out.\n\nI wonder when Yahoo and Google plan to get into the VLE market?\n\nSherri Vokey - Whaaaaaaa? Blackboard and WebCT have announced plans to merge. In the short term, it looks like both services will operate as-is with a longer term plan to incorporate the features of both under the 'Blackboard' brand.\n\nI used to work with WebCT in my previous position and have to admit that I've never been a fan, either as a user or an adminstrator, though I never did get a chance to see what new features became available in the Vista release (and I hear there were some exciting improvements). In any case, we're heading down the Sakai path here at FIS/UofT.\n\nLee Kraus - Yesterday, Blackboard and WebCT announced that they have agreed to merge. What this merger will mean to higher education should be interesting. I remember reading a blog not too long asking if Blackboard and WebCT would exist in five years? Well the answer is no, at least not in their current form.\n\nDavid Davies - Blackboard and WebCT have announced agreement to merge with BlackBoard remaining as the brand name. In reality however, WebCT, both the company and the platform, will be stripped and incorporated into Bb. So, is this a good thing or a bad thing? Well for starters itÃ¯Â¿Â½ll make the WebCT or Bb decision that bit easier! But pity the smaller VLE/LMS vendors whoÃ¯Â¿Â½ll now have a monster to battle. More importantly I think this merger will probably be a threat to interoperability standards.\n\nA couple of years ago I was at the IMS Alt-i-lab meeting in San Francisco and heard two very interesting and honest presentations from the CTOs of both WebCT and BlackBoard. Effectively they were saying that BigCo vendors were cautious about embracing interoperability too vigourously because their companies have a commercial imperative to maintain their distinctiveness in the market place. Imagine if you could use WebCT one week, effortlessly switch to BlackBoard the next and so on, Ã¯Â¿Â½what would be the reason for remaining loyal to any one system?Ã¯Â¿Â½, or so they argued.\n\nWhile the big two vendors remained separate there was always a customer demand for the ability to at least in principle switch content from one system to the other as universities for instance feared content lock-in. With the announcement of this merger a major reason for content interoperability has probably just disappeared. Sure there remain a number of very good but much smaller systems as alternatives to the Bb/WebCT behemoth but if you were BlackBoard would you work hard to make sure your content or services were interoperable with those? Well letÃ¯Â¿Â½s hope so, but I think this news is going to present some real challenges to the interoperability folks. There are alternatives, choose open source for example, but if you were a university where would you put your money?\n\nHarold Jarche - Via Stephen is the news that the two biggest course management systems for the academic market are going to merge into a single corporate entity, though the Blackboard company name will dominate. Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n* My first question remains, \"Does it do anything for the learner?\" A: I don't think so.\n\n* Elliott will say he saw it coming all along ;-)\n\n* This makes the comparison with open source learning systems a lot easier, because there will be fewer proprietary systems to compare with :-)\n\n* The WebCT brand will quickly fade away (don't want to confuse the client) * License fees will increase for this \"new & improved\" product.\n\n* Those really interested in facilitating learning, like George, will continue to do their own thing and still not be engaged in a discussion by Blackboard.\n\nMichael Feldstein - Now is exactly the wrong time to be locking in, because weÃ¯Â¿Â½re just now starting to figure out what these durned things should really look like. And what they should look like is not like either Blackboard or WebCT. Let me emphasize that I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have anything against either of these two companies or the people who work at them. While I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t particularly like either product, I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re evil, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not ideologically opposed to large companies, and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not ideologically opposed to proprietary software, either. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want Blackboard to die; I just want them to evolve. But this move at this time in this space is potentially very bad for innovation in product category that really isnÃ¯Â¿Â½t mature yet.\n\nI stand by my earlier claim that monolithic LMSÃ¯Â¿Â½s are doomed in the long run. The componentized, standards-compliant approach just makes too much sense on too many levels. But Blackboard may have made a move to substantially retard this process of natural selection. The big dinosaur can survive for quite a while by eating all the little ones. That makes it unsafe for mammals for the foreseeable future.\n\nNow is the time. It will take Blackboard some time to digest WebCT. The FOSS communities need to get their acts together on standards and pick up the pace of innovation. If we donÃ¯Â¿Â½t learn to start hunting in packs really well really soon, we may be living in fear of B-Rex for some time to come.\n\nPegj - Inner Psyche - There was never any doubt about it, the consolidation of the e-learning industry was always going to happen. The big question was going to be if the current industry participants would be the drivers, or if some external forces would come to play and move things forward.\n\nTo date we have seen a steady release of news about who was getting together with who, but the tipping point at last seems to have arrived with news in recent weeks including SumTotal and Pathlore getting together and SABA and Centra agreeing that heir future lies in a deal with one another.\n\nAnd to prove that there is now no going back, and that a radically different e-learning landscape will exist next year, we today have Blackboard agreeing to buy WebCT in a deal worth in the region of $154m.\n\nThe challenge for this new enterprise will be if they can move out of their educational stronghold and into a corporate market, before the open-source versions (Moodle, Drupal, ATutor, etc.) of their products overtake them.\n\nI believe that these past few weeks have been a major milestone in the development of the e-learning industry, and in the next few months we will now start to see companies currently outside of the industry running their sliderules over revenue, growth and profit expectations.\n\nNew! Bryan Alexander - One business now has the lion's share of the CMS market. BB is the new Microsoft for this field.\n\nBB's Incentive to innovate just dropped still further.\n\nThe conflict between proprietary and open source CMSes just deepened. I expect a BB FUD campaign or two. Watch for them to paint Sakai as, oh, elitist and overambitious. And Moodle et al, perhaps too amateurish, or beneath competition.\n\nWhat will happen to WebCT courses archived, being run now, planned for spring '06? Will they persist as WebCT safe havens within the BBverse, or get morphed into the new order?\n\nBest Comments From SlashDot"
