For LMS buyers.\n\nTop 3 Things We Learned at Cornerstone Connect Live Los Angeles 2023\n\nBluewater Learning\n\nThe overarching message was unambiguous: Cornerstone has set the stage for a transformative journey across their product suite, including Cornerstone, SumTotal, and Saba. Let's delve into the most salient points of discussion.\n\nJoin 84,000+\n\nInsiders\n\nSign Up for our Newsletter\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nWebinars\n\nMastering Remote Onboarding: Proven Strategies for Seamless New Hire Integration\n\nMORE WEBINARS\n\nTop 5 Things We Learned at Cornerstone Convergence 2022\n\nBluewater Learning\n\nOur team met with Cornerstone, Saba, EdCast, and SumTotal customers. I also know that it is just what the industry needed. We are designed to be with people, to engage and learn from each other. That is just what we did. We learned, together. What did we learn?\n\nWebinars\n\nMastering Remote Onboarding: Proven Strategies for Seamless New Hire Integration\n\nMORE WEBINARS\n\nAcquistions – Someone had an idea\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nThe initial person who thought buying SumTotal was a great idea (initially it was) and then dumped it for a fortune to Skillsoft (another great idea), which in turn was someone at Skillsoft thinking this was a great idea, which turned out to be false and was a factor in Skillsoft going into bankruptcy due to the albatross known as SumTotal.\n\nDocebo: The hottest learning tech company in years\n\nDocebo\n\nVendors like Saba (the pioneer), Plateau (fast follower), SumTotal (conglomerate), and hundreds of others have been acquired. Vendors like Degreed, BetterUp, EdCast, and LinkedIn command billion-dollar valuations driven by this growth. In some ways, this market is quite mature.\n\nThe Cornerstone Acquisition\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nI bring this up, because after it was announced that Cornerstone will be acquiring SumTotal, the pundits went out and espoused some very interesting ideas. I never put innovation and SumTotal in the same sentence. SumTotal was never innovative. They were not the first ones with a mobile app. Bottom Line.\n\nVegas and The Learning Conference Scene\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nFor SumTotal clients and/or those considering SumTotal, rest assured that Cornerstone will continue to invest in the system, including learning. And if you are someone who still wants Saba, it is available – you just can’t find or see it on their web site – so you have to ask for it.\n\nUpdate on Saba: Turnaround In The Making?\n\nJosh Bersin on Enterprise Learning\n\nLast month Saba, a pioneer in the market for enterprise learning and talent management systems , held its annual customer conference (more than 700 learning and HR professionals attended). I had a chance to meet with the management team, talk with many customers and employees, and talk with Saba’s new owners (Vector Capital).\n\nUpdate on Saba: Turnaround In The Making?\n\nJosh Bersin on Enterprise Learning\n\nLast month Saba, a pioneer in the market for enterprise learning and talent management systems , held its annual customer conference (more than 700 learning and HR professionals attended).

This week Vista Equity Partners upped its bid to $4.75 a share (up from $3.80\n\nGeoLearning Acquired by SumTotal: The mLearning Impact?\n\nmLearning Trends\n\nThe enterprise learning market witnessed another big consolidation event today as SumTotal Systems announced it acquired GeoLearning thus further positioning SumTotal as the largest platform provider for LMS and talent management solutions in the industry.

I have some real concerns on what is taking place with Saba today. Cornerstone On Demand Saba SuccessFactors SumTotal'\n\nLatest Takeaways from Craig Weiss\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nIt has been a wild week from the acquisition of Saba by Cornerstone to the ability to compare systems in detail on FindAnLMS, to the Coronavirus and the usage of Microsoft Teams as part of the L&D experience. Cornerstone Acquires Saba. I viewed the buy as more of what it told me about Saba, rather than Cornerstone.\n\nWant to be successful at e-Learning? Don’t make the mistakes experts make!\n\nChallenge to Learn\n\nYou can buy a big system that does all (like Blackboard, Sumtotal, Saba, Cornerstone on demand, et cetera) or you can go for a bunch of specialized tools that will beat that big solution on every specialty. But for most (if not all) of these fields we have a specialist in the company that is better than I am.\n\nWant to be successful at e-Learning?

I don’t predict the end of big systems like Saba, SumTotal, SAP or any other LMS vendor overnight. I think it’s clear that the function provided by the LMS no longer belongs in an entirely separate system.\n\nSaba Acquires Centra\n\nJosh Bersin on Enterprise Learning\n\nIn the last 12 months we have seen many mergers in the learning market take place: Oracle’s acquisition of Peoplesoft, SumTotal’s acquisition of Pathlore, Saba’s acquisition of Thinq, and KnowledgePlanet’s acquisition of KnowledgeImpact. Why these Mergers are Occurring. The LMS market has grown big enough.\n\nSaba Acquires Centra\n\nJosh Bersin on Enterprise Learning\n\nIn the last 12 months we have seen many mergers in the learning market take place: Oracle’s acquisition of Peoplesoft, SumTotal’s acquisition of Pathlore, Saba’s acquisition of Thinq, and KnowledgePlanet’s acquisition of KnowledgeImpact. Why these Mergers are Occurring. The LMS market has grown big enough.\n\nCan you recommend an LMS?\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nI know SumTotal Learning Management gets tagged regularly when it comes to support. And I know folks who leave them are usually unhappy for various reasons, but I can tell you that I have had two in-depth meetings with SumTotal including one with the VP of Customer Service/Support and have seen the metrics. Saba the same thing.\n\nNexGen Learning System Grid 2018-19\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nCornerstone Learning Suite, Fuse, Litmos by SAP, eLogic Learning, SumTotal Learning Management, Growth Engineering. SumTotal Learning Management (Formally known as SumTotal Learn) jumps over from Steady to Leader in just one year. Unicorn LMS, Workday Learning, Degreed, Saba, Torch LMS, Learn Amp. What’s that?”\n\nFive classifications of Learning Management Systems (LMS)\n\nConnect Thinking\n\nSumTotal , Saba , Cornerstone ). In my experience they are characterised by complex, clunky functionality for both administrators and end users. The purchase decision is often made by the people in charge of the ERP system itself.

Owned by SumTotal – who ruined it, because by then it was GeoLearning Maestro (not that great). Owned by SumTotal – who ruined it, because by then it was GeoLearning Maestro (not that great). SumTotal called it SumTotal Maestro.\n\nLearning Solutions Series: Top 10 Learning Management Systems\n\nInsiderHub\n\nHere are the top 10 LMS brands owned: Blackboard Internal/Developed In-House SAP/SuccessFactors/Plateau SumTotal Cornerstone OnDemand Oracle Skillsoft/Skillport Saba HealthStream Moodle Others Learning management systems are used in both corporate as well as academic settings.\n\nTop 20 Enterprise Learning Systems 2022\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nI wouldn’t touch the Saba solution, which has another alphabetical salad of letters, because CBX is significantly better. SumTotal (Learning Management) – $$$ to $$$$. SumTotal seems to have the same issue as Cornerstone, when it comes to metrics/analytics – a lot there, bad UI/UX. Mobile is good.\n\nNaming Names – LMS Mini Reviews\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nSaba Cloud (Legacy is finished – at least in my opinion – and the cloud is the way to go, but is it for Saba customers?). The whole “non-traditional” push or more importantly, when a vendor says “traditional” implies that their system is not like Cornerstone, SumTotal, and alike. Saba Cloud.\n\nThe Augmented LMS: New Life for Talent Management Learning?\n\nTalented Learning\n\nOld-school LMS companies (like SumTotal , Plateau , Learn.com , GeoLearning and Certpoint ) were acquired by much larger talent and HR-suite providers like SAP/SuccessFactors , Infor , Oracle and IBM. Other well-known independent players like Cornerstone , Saba and Workday opted to compete by building their own talent suites.\n\nMeridian Expands Leadership Team with Learning Industry Experts\n\nMeridian\n\nPrior to Blackboard, Ken held public sector sales roles at Saba and SumTotal Systems. Ken joins Meridian from Blackboard where he served as a key member of their Professional Education (ProEd) Federal Government solutions team.\n\nQ&A from Blog Readers on E-Learning\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nQ : I am curious on why Cornerstone On Demand, Saba and SumTotal do not appear in your top twenty lists even though they appear on other sites as the best products in the market. Saba - A solid system, but IMO (in my opinion) better suited for talent/performance management. So, back for another installment.\n\nRecommended Learning Systems\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nSumTotal Learning Management – They have come a long way. I readily admit for the longest time I was not a fan of SumTotal, but that was then, this is now. Saba Cloud – Saba is such a wild card here. They are on F indAnLMS.com. And they need to offer more flexibility when it comes to certificate management.\n\n2015 Talented Learning LMS Vendor Award Recipients\n\nTalented Learning\n\nSaba Software. The world’s best talent LMS solution are: Saba. SumTotal. . Joe Majors , Saba Software. . Sean McCarthy , SumTotal. eLogic Learning. Cornerstone. . Honorable Mentions. Blackboard. SwissTeach. WBT Systems. . BEST CHANNEL & PARTNER LMS. YM Learning. LogicBay. . Honorable Mentions.\n\nSCORM Test\n\nTony Karrer\n\nDocent, SumTotal, Saba, Learn.com, etc.). Have you ever tried contacting SumTotal about what options they have available for third-party courseware testing? There have been lots of good comments and discussion on the post Test SCORM Courses with an LMS : eLearning Technology. Well worth looking at some of them.\n\nProduct Vendor Blogs - Where are They?\n\nTony Karrer\n\nWhere's a blog from Saba, SumTotal? One thing that just dawned on me is how few product vendor blogs there are in eLearning. If you look on my link roll, there's one from Articulate, elgg, ummm. I'm already running out. Do they not have anything interesting to say about where things are going? How about Lectora?\n\nThe LMS Market: Hotter than Ever\n\nJosh Bersin on Enterprise Learning\n\nIn the last 60 days I’ve had the opportunity to attend five major industry events which cover corporate learning: user group meetings at Plateau, Saba, SumTotal and Taleo and the HR Technology Conference.

Read more» The post The LMS Market: Hotter than Ever appeared first on JOSH BERSIN.\n\nKevin Oakes on the Rise and Fall of the LMS\n\nTony Karrer\n\nAnd when you go look at the LMS providers, they don't call themselves an LMS anymore: â€¢ SumTotal is a global provider of talent and learning management solutions. â€¢ Saba is the premier global provider of strategic human capital management (HCM) software and services. So, how can you get big? You go broader.\n\nInnovators' Dilemma in Learning/eLearning\n\nTony Karrer\n\nDoes anyone from Saba, SumTotal, Adobe/Macromedia/eHelp, Lectora, etc. The fact that the discussion around Product Vendor Blogs and Innovation came back that it may be there but is hidden suggests that they aren't going to be the source. What will be the source?\n\n3rd Trend – Performance\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nSome offer it as a module – staying with the way of the legacy systems, such as Saba, SumTotal who offered PM or TM as a module. In this modern performance aspect, the vendor is screaming from the rooftops – we are employee-focused. We are all about employees.\n\nThe Cornerstone Effect\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nSimilar thoughts are often associated with SumTotal (although they have vastly improved their UI, but they do see themselves at least from my take, and even through a Google search as a HCM, especially after the acquisition by Skillsoft), SuccessFactors, Oracle Learn, Saba, Kenexa and a few others. The biggest name of who offers it?\n\n2017 Talented Learning LMS Awards: Best of the Best\n\nTalented Learning\n\nSumTotal Systems. Travis Hudelson – Saba. Typical use cases include global employee learning management from hire to fire through shared data and workflows that drive relevant content recommendations, skills and competencies development, succession planning and performance reviews. Honorable Mentions. SAP – SuccessFactors.\n\nB2B Top Five LMSs\n\neLearning 24-7\n\n5 – SumTotal Learn. But if you can and you want to decide between CoD, SF, Saba or SumTotal. Go SumTotal. They do not have a “preferred number” However, they required a few more items to be “customized” to slide into the top five rankings. That said, I do like the very hip modern UI.\n\nTop 50 LMS Report for 2016 – What you need to know (criteria, approach, and yeah some vendors)\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nI identify the Big Dogs as SumTotal by Skillsoft (yes, that is the actual name), Cornerstone OnDemand, Saba, SucessFactors and Oracle Taleo (although, I ask myself who is using this and if you still are why?). However, I will say this: I like what Saba is doing. SumTotal by Skillsoft – the 2016 re-haul is a huge plus."
