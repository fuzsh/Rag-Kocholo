INTRODUCTION This Unit gives an introduction to e-learning. E-learning is a new teaching methodology that utilizes IT and Web technology for design, development and delivery of learning content. This method of training is gaining ground in the industry where employees are required to update their knowledge and skills through training, but at the same time these employees cannot spare the time to undertake this training through traditional methods of training. Most of the employees of enterprises of today have fundamental knowledge and are familiar with IT technology. It is in this context, that e-learning has gained popularity and acceptance both among employees and employers. In fact employers are actively utilizing e-learning to remove performance gaps in the skills and training of its employees. In addition, e-learning is gaining ground as a viable alternative to traditional distance education, because e-learning allows more effective utilization of scarce experts and helps to take quality education to remote corners of the world. 1.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVES •\n\nTo understand the context of e-learning and explain the concept\n\n•\n\nTo define e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo describe the various elements of e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo outline the various benefits of e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo understand the various issues of e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo discuss the different aspects of the e-learning industry\n\n•\n\nTo list the models of e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo explain the Return of Investments (ROI) with respect to e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo discuss the various types of e-learning cycles\n\n•\n\nTo outline the drivers of e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo explain the details of e-learning strategy\n\n1\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.3 WHAT IS E-LEARNING? As you know today’s world is dominated by various types of electronic media and learning needs to keep in tune and exploit this wide spectrum of media facilities. Growing expectations, changing learning patterns, globalization and personalization have changed the face of education. Moreover the necessity to keep abreast of fast changing developments in almost every field means that it is imperative to continue learning from many sources, levels and at any place, anytime, outside the spectrum of formal education. Thus was introduced the concept of “e-learning”. If the full potential of media based learning is exploited it is possible to supplement and enhance the teaching learning process of conventional education. E-learning can support the continuing education process for meeting the needs of employers and workplace learners. E-learning is an effective methodology to cope with increasing student strength and limited teaching and infrastructure resources. There are really no models of e-learning per se – only e-enhancements of models of learning. •\n\nEssentially we use technology to achieve better learning outcomes, or a more effective assessment of these outcomes, or a more cost-efficient way of bringing the learning environment to the learners.\n\n•\n\nIt is all the more important, when implementing e-learning methodologies, to be clear about the underlying assumptions. A model of e-learning would need to demonstrate on what pedagogic principles the added value of the ‘e’ is operating.\n\n•\n\nFor example, the ‘e’ allow remote learners to interact with each other and with the representations of the subject matter in a form that could simply not be achieved for those learners without the technology that we have is a genuine example of added value. However, the role of the technology here is primarily to get remote learners into a position to learn as favorably as though they were campus-based, rather than offering a new teaching method. In such a case the enhancement should be seen as pragmatic rather than pedagogic, achieving cost effective access to learning, rather than a new way to achieve deep understanding of a concept.\n\n•\n\nEven something that looks like a new paradigm for achieving learning outcomes, a peer-to-peer learner-matching tool, for example, may represent only an incremental advance in pedagogic terms, though its educational value may be enormous if it could be exploited through an educational infrastructure which integrated its use with quality assurance methods. It is important, therefore, not to take too narrow a view of what constitutes e-learning, or of where its main value might lie.\n\nNow let us look at some of the contexts in which e-learning is utilized. •\n\nE-learning is widely used today by many organizations to help their employees to keep abreast of latest trends.\n\n2\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n•\n\nIn addition, e-learning is used by many institutes and universities for supplementing the teaching process and to enable students the flexibility of time, place and to a certain extent pace of learning.\n\n•\n\nMoreover, e-learning provides wider opportunities for learning by giving access to wider range and type of learning material that would support different styles of learning.\n\n•\n\nE-learning allows more flexible course management and moreover provides an almost one-to-one communication between the teacher and the learner.\n\n•\n\nIn addition e-learning can make available teachers from different parts of the globe to share their expertise with the learners.\n\nNOTES\n\nMany aspects of the teaching learning process can benefit from the integration of educational technologies adopted by e-learning. These include: •\n\nEasy availability of a wide variety of online resources to encourage discussion and collective deliberations, critical analysis and effective learning\n\n•\n\nPresentation of realistic case studies to aid application oriented learning\n\n•\n\nOnline discussion boards in a secure environment to support collaborative learning and facilitate the participation of external experts\n\n•\n\nSimulations and animations to explain complex processes\n\n•\n\nReal-time communication tools such as chat, shared whiteboards and videoconferencing to promote collaboration and debate\n\n•\n\nComputer-aided assessments to enable effective feedback to learners\n\nLet us first understand what is meant by e-learning. E-learning can be described as a methodology of education that incorporates Information and Internet technologies. However online learning, virtual learning, distributed learning, network and webbased learning are also sometimes used to describe this mode of education. Although essentially all the terms refer to the educational process that utilizes information and communications technology to mediate asynchronous as well as synchronous learning and teaching activities. 1.3.1. What Makes E-learning Unique? Three instructional methods potentially valuable to e-learning are: •\n\nPractice with automated tailored feedback – What is special about the computer’s role in learning is that the learner’s actions taken in the simulation are evaluated by a program that responds with hints or feedback supporting immediate corrections of errors\n\n•\n\nIntegration of collaboration with self-study – Learners can communicate by computer in real time through chats or at different times by e-mail and discussion boards. There are studies which indicate the benefits of learning together versus learning solo. 3\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n•\n\nUse of Simulation to accelerate expertise – here realistic job problems are compressed into a short timeframe to make the learner understand the real problem.\n\nHave You Understood? 1. Why was the concept of e-learning introduced? 2. What is the role of technology in e-learning? 3. What are the other terms used to describe this method of education? 4. What makes e-learning unique? 1.4 DEFINITION OF E-LEARNING E-learning can take many forms. In its simplest form, elements of e-learning such as using presentation software and web uploading of data can be introduced into traditional teaching. Blended programs also exist which use elements of e-learning blended with traditional techniques. Finally there are e-learning programs which are offered completely online. E-learning can be defined in many ways from different perspectives. E-learning can be defined as the “The delivery of a learning, training or education program by electronic means. E-learning involves the use of a computer or electronic device (e.g. a mobile phone) in some way to provide training, educational or learning material.” (Derek Stockley 2003). This definition only stresses the use of an electronic device to facilitate the teaching learning process. Som Naidu on the other hand defines elearning as “E-learning is commonly referred to the intentional use of networked information and communications technology in teaching and learning.” (Som Naidu 2006). He refers to the use of both network and communication technologies as facilitators of e-learning. Wikipedia defines e-Learning is a general term used to refer to computerenhanced learning. It is used interchangeably in so many contexts that it is critical to be clear what one means when one speaks of ‘eLearning’. “In many respects, it is commonly associated with the field of advanced learning technology (ALT), which deals with both the technologies and associated methodologies in learning using networked and/or multimedia technologies”. Other definitions given for e-learning include “E-learning is the use of Internet and digital technologies to create experiences that educate our fellow human beings” (Horton, 2001) and the one given by CISCO as “E-learning combines communication, education, information, and training and is a core element of a successful ebusiness strategy.” A more comprehensive definition has been given by Don Morrison . He defines e-Learning as “ E-learning is the continuous assimilation of knowledge and skills by adults stimulated by synchronous and asynchronous learning events – and sometimes Knowledge Management outputs – which are authored, delivered, engaged with, supported and administrated using Internet technologies.” (Don Morrison 2003). 4\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nThese aspects are shown in Figure 1.1. In order to get a complete picture of what is meant by e-learning, let us discuss in detail the definition given by Morrison. According to him elearning is only suitable for adults who have already finished formal education. E-learning implicitly requires the learner to be self motivated and share the responsibility in the teaching learning process.\n\nNOTES\n\nAn important component Morrison has included in the definition is the inclusion of synchronous and asynchronous learning events. Let us examine this aspect in detail. Synchronous learning takes place in real time with both the learners and the teacher being present at the same time although remotely. In other words, spontaneous interaction takes place with no time delay. The learning happens at fixed time i.e. virtual classrooms are scheduled. Learners can interrupt and ask for clarifications.\n\nFig.1.1 Definition of E-learning There are various mechanisms by which this type of remote interaction can take place. These include the following: •\n\nTelephone\n\n•\n\nVideo conference\n\n•\n\nVirtual classroom\n\n•\n\nPeer-to-peer communication based on Instant Messaging Technologies\n\n5\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n•\n\n• •\n\nAsynchronous learning on the other hand takes place according to the learner’s convenience and at learner’s pace. Asynchronous learning takes place anywhere and at any time it is needed. E-learning in one sense is a different way of knowledge management. Knowledge Management generally delivers processed knowledge. On the other hand, e-learning delivers knowledge processed to cater to the teaching learning process. E-learning Takes subject content expertise Orients the content according to an instructional design process\n\n•\n\nPresents the content in a suitable framework\n\nInternet Technologies and protocols are the essence of an effective e-learning scenario and are actually the enablers of e-learning. Internet technologies support e-learning across the following spectrum of activities: • Self paced e-learning courses are usually hosted on a web server and delivered through a standardized web browser or an e-learning customized web browser. • Peer to peer collaboration through Instant messaging for synchronous learning • Browser based e-learning and administration support •\n\nVoice over IP techniques for telephone support could be browser based Table 1.1 The ‘e’ in e-learning\n\nExploration\n\ne-learners use the Web as an exploratory tool to access as a huge variety and amount of information and resources Experience Web offers e-learners a total learning experience, from synchronous learning to threaded discussions to self-paced learning Engagement Web captivates learners by enabling creative approaches to learning that foster collaboration and a sense of community Ease of use Web is easy to use for learners who are already familiar with the navigation capabilities of the medium as well as for content providers as they can easily make content immediately available to learners across all technical platforms Empowerment Web puts learners in the driver’s seat with a set of tools that enables personalization of content and allows learners to choose the way in which they learn\n\nViewing from another perspective we can explain e-learning by understanding the ‘e’ of e-learning as given in Table 1.1. Thus the different definitions of e-learning give us a broad idea of the lower end and the higher end of the e-learning spectrum. Have You Understood? 1. Give three definitions of e-learning. 2. What are synchronous and asynchronous learning events? 3. How does Internet technologies support e-learning? 6\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n1.5 ELEMENTS OF E-LEARNING\n\nNOTES\n\nThe elements of e-learning cover the complete process of imparting education including learner registration process, content creation, facilities for collaborative learning, and administration processes. 1.5.1 Learner registration process: This process includes providing online facilities for registration by the learner. The various components include: •\n\nInformation Brochure – providing access to information regarding various programmes on offer\n\n•\n\nLogon – provide the learner with unique ID and take care of security. Provision may be made to change security policies from time to time. In addition there may be provision for visitors, registered learners and registered teachers with different levels of security.\n\n•\n\nRegistration – allow registration of each student for a programme after checking necessary constraints.\n\n•\n\nPersonal Profile – collect the necessary personal details\n\n•\n\nCompetency Assessments – allow for conduct of Online tests for checking competency with provision to incorporate various admission policies\n\n1.5.2 Learner Personalization Process This process includes provisions necessary to track and personalize the learning process to suit the needs of individual user. The various components include: •\n\nCourse enrolment Process - provision for individual learner to enroll for a course subject to constraints\n\n•\n\nPre-defined learning paths – providing suggested organized pre-defined path of learning for each course. There may be different pre-defined paths to suit different levels of learners.\n\n•\n\nPersonal Learning path – providing individual learning path personalized to suit each learner.\n\n•\n\nCustomizable Home Page – providing options to learners to customize home pages.\n\n1.5.3 Teaching Learning Process This process includes provisions for course delivery, deciding the elements of course material and source of course material and the methods of interaction between the different participants of the e-learning process.\n\n7\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n• Course material – the material can be outsourced or can be created in-house. Provision needs to be made to incorporate some of these elements into the Content delivered. o Text o Graphics, images, photographs o Steaming Animations, audio, video o Simulations o Interactive Exercises o Online and downloadable tools o Quizzes o Bookmarks o Online notepads o Feedback forms • Course material delivery and interaction: - the mode of delivery of the course material can vary. In addition, the method of interaction between the group of learners, individual learner, and the teacher can be performed in many ways. Some of the methods are given below: o Courses or course elements can be downloaded o Electronic Performance support system o Formal and informal peer-to-peer communication using Message Boards o Informal peer-to-peer communication through Instant Messaging o Live and archived virtual classrooms, Web casts o Links to public or subscription web sites o Online help files/desks o Telephone help desks Most of the instructional strategies or course delivery strategies which have been effectively used in traditional classroom can also used in e-learning as given in Figure 1.2\n\nFig. 1.2 Instructional Strategies\n\n8\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nEach of the dimensions can be further extended in detail as given in Figure 1.3.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.5.4 Administrative processes In order to effectively conduct e-learning programmes some modules needs to be available. These include: •\n\nTracking Mechanisms - this process is to enable the tracking of all activities of the education process including tracking the complete stay of a student in the programme, admission process, a particular group progress, a particular subject progress, a particular teacher’s activity etc.\n\nFig. 1.3 Details of Instructional Strategies •\n\nReporting Tools – the tools will enable creating reports of all information including current number of students on rolls for each programme, assessment details of students, etc.\n\n•\n\nCertification Process – this process will enable certification after checking for all constraints.\n\n•\n\nMaintenance of skills database - a database containing all details regarding teachers, their areas of expertise etc needs to be maintained.\n\n9\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nFig. 1.4 Steps in E-learning development\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n10\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIntegration with other administration software – Links with other administrative processes including human resources, salaries, fees collection etc. needs to be established. Tools Maintenance – tools such as course management tools, learning management tools, localization tools and content authoring tools needs to be procured and maintained.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe elements of e-learning detailed above are all required components of a complete system. Only a small subset of the components is present in most systems. In order to be really effective the incorporation of e-learning elements into the teaching learning process and the personalization process are essential. 1.5.5 Complete E-learning Development Process E-learning can be oriented towards improving organizational performance of an enterprise. The steps in the e-learning development viewed from this perspective are shown in Figure 1.4. Have You Understood? 1. What are the components of the Learner Registration Process? 2. What are the methods of Course material delivery and interaction? 3. What are the elements that can constitute content material? 4. What are the important components of the administration process of e-learning? 1.6 BENEFITS OF E-LEARNING Undoubtedly E-learning is here to stay. E-learning is beneficial in many ways. Let us explore some of the benefits of e-learning. 1.6.1 Learner-Centric One of the important benefits of e-learning is that e-learning is controlled by the learner. It is the learners who decide how, what and when they want to access information. The whole concept of e-learning is designed around the learner. The learner can make available content on demand and control their interaction. In other words, learning is self paced allowing the learner to vary the pace of learning to suit his need, is self-directed allowing learners to decide the level and methodology of content delivery. Students can adapt well to e-learning because it accommodates different types of learning styles. Students can learn through a variety of activities that apply to many different learning styles learners have. Learners can fit e-learning into their busy schedule. If they hold a job, they can still be working while accommodating e-learning. If the learner needs to do the learning at night, then this option is available. In conclusion, e-learning provides a learner centered environment which can be tailored to meet the learning needs of individual learners.\n\n11\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.6.2 Portability and Flexibility One of the major benefits of e-learning is the flexibility of learning from any place at any time. Education is available when and where it is needed. E-learning can be done at the office, at home, on the road, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. International and remote locations can access information outside regular timings and have access to expertise available at remote locations. 1.6.3 Situated learning The technology used in e-learning allows access from home and work and the learner can easily integrate the ideas being discussed on the course with the working environment, or access resources on the Internet as required on the job. 1.6.4 Dynamic configuration The content delivery can be dynamically configured to suit environment and learner needs. In other words the content can be transformed and presented in a personalized and customized manner. The e-learning process can be configured to suit learner preferences where the content presentation can be changed, pace of learning can be varied and the elements of the content material can be modified. 1.6.5 Collaborative interactive learning Allows collaborative, interactive learning L2L, (Learner to Learner), E2L (Expert to Learner), L2E (Learner to Expert), E2E (Expert to Expert) , L2C (Learner to Content), C2L (Content to Learner). E-Learning supports increased communications between teachers and learners, and amongst students, providing frequent and timely individual feedback, for example through computer assisted assessment, and positive reinforcement. E-learning strives to motivate learners through appropriate use of interactive courseware. The concept implicitly and explicitly supports active learning, encourages learners to take responsibility of learning and orients learners towards collaborative learning. Learners are able to meet in a virtual space with other members and practitioner experts to discuss issues, answer questions and even participate in simulations and management games without having to leave their office or home. Collaborative learning in addition provides motivation where synchronous systems focus the energy of the group, thus learners have an added motivation to keep up with their peers and continue with their studies. Learners develop group cohesion and the sense of being part of a learning community through real time interaction that conveys tone and nuance. The good feedback mechanism allows learners to receive quick feedback on ideas as well as consensus and decision making in group activities, thus enlivening e-learning from a distance.\n\n12\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n1.6.6 Reusability Content of any media can be granularized and made as an independent module to enable assembly and dynamic presentation of learning material in an effective and meaningful manner. E-learning allows ease of updation and alignment to ever shortening product cycles. Flexible and reusable objects mean that editing, updates and changes can happen without reissuing materials, which saves time and money. E-learning thus supports economic reuse of high quality, expensive resources.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.6.7 Availability of expertise and resources This increases availability and productivity of subject experts. Instead of answering a question over and over to different people, expert information is captured and available when needed. In addition, e-learning provides access to a range of resources and materials which may not otherwise be available or accessible, for example graphics, sound, animation, multimedia. 1.6.8 Infrastructure saving E-learning eliminates static overhead of expensive classroom space, managing books and binders, computers, projectors, food and repeated need for subject experts. 1.6.9 Measurable Assessments E-learning also has measurable assessments which can be created so that both the instructors and students will know what the students have learned, when they’ve completed courses, and how they have performed. ROI (Return of Investment) is easier to determine by using “hit” reports from web areas, access reports by module and other tools to determine spread and impact of modules. We can get objective usage reports about the effectiveness of the e-learning programme. 1.6.10 Incentives to Industry Personnel •\n\nThis encourages industry to provide e-learning opportunities to their employees either to update their skills or to improve their educational qualifications. Providing these opportunities could help the industry to retain their employees and provide a better working environment.\n\n1.6.11 Informality in learning Learning does not always take place in a formal setting. More exchange and assimilation of information takes place in informal settings such as chat rooms, and one to one interactions and discussions. E-learning complements traditional e-learning where learning can take place at the learner’s own pace. Moreover learning in a more familiar, non-threatening environment can extend the learning experience. E-learning has encouraged more people to take up learning. In other words e-learning helps to develop positive attitudes to learning, builds confidence and encourages people to return to learning\n\n13\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.6.12 Minimal incremental delivery cost Very small incremental cost is needed to support 10 or 10,000 learners. 1.6.13 Development of ICT skills Learners improve ICT skills through e-learning. In addition due to collaborative techniques required for e-learning the learners acquire skills to present their work. In spite of some of the obvious benefits of e-learning, there are some challenges and issues that need to be addressed before e-learning can take off. 1.6.14 Pitfalls of E-learning Despite impressive capabilities of e-learning, there are three main barriers to the realization of e learning which has been summarized in Table 1.2. Table 1.2 Pitfalls of E-learning\n\nPitfall\n\nResult\n\nFailure to define job knowledge and skills\n\nLessons do not build knowledge and skills that transfer to the job\n\nFailure to accommodate learning processes\n\nLessons overload cognitive processes and learning is disrupted\n\nAttrition\n\nLearners do not complete their instruction\n\nHave You Understood? 1. What are the learner centric benefits of e-learning? 2. What do you mean by collaborative interactive learning? 3. Why is e-learning also considered as an informal process? 1.7 CHALLENGES AND ISSUES E-learning does not entail mere transfer of information. In this context, it is important for you to note that the mere availability of technologies and communication facilities is not by itself sufficient for e-learning. 1.7.1 Use of new technologies for teaching A very important component of this e-learning scenario is the innovative teaching ability of the teacher to utilize these technologies and facilities for effective teaching. As new technologies appear that can potentially transform education, we must not be driven\n\n14\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nby the functionality these technologies offer but must concentrate on the potential use of these technologies to enhance the teaching-learning process. Many aspects of the teaching learning process can be enhanced by some of the following facilities: •\n\nAvailability of a rich variety of online resources that can enhance the level of teaching and learning\n\n•\n\nProblem based learning using multimedia case studies\n\n•\n\nThe use of real-time communication tools such as online discussion boards, chat rooms, and video conferencing for collaborative learning\n\n•\n\nAvailability of technologies for simulations and animations to support experiments, practical exercises and teach complex phenomena\n\n•\n\nThe use of online testing and assignments to improve speed and quality of feedback.\n\nNOTES\n\nAnother issue in providing effective e-learning is that teachers have their own preferred methods of teaching which suit their style and discipline. For many of the teachers the carefully thought out integration of e-learning tools can enhance teaching approaches and enable enhanced interaction with students at all levels, both on and off classrooms. An integration of all aspects of teaching would enhance the learning experience offered to learners. In conclusion, you can understand that innovative teaching methods need to be explored in order to expose the full potential of e-learning. The core skills of a good e-learning instructor includes: •\n\ngood communication skills\n\n•\n\ngood planning skills\n\n•\n\ngood technical skills\n\n•\n\ngood organization\n\n•\n\nfamiliarity with the structure of the course\n\n•\n\nsubject expertise\n\n•\n\nenthusiasm\n\n•\n\nability to deploy resources effectively\n\n•\n\ngood relationships with learners\n\n•\n\na flexible approach.\n\n1.7.2 Shared Responsibilities of learner E-learning involves much more than the simple transfer of information. Moreover elearning is an effective understanding of shared responsibility between the teacher and learner. In addition, we must realize that it is important for the learner to set aside his conventional outlook to the learning process and adapt and utilize all facilities at his disposal 15\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nin an effective manner. Thus you must now realize, for e-learning to really succeed there has to be a synergy between technology, the teacher and the learner. In essence learners need to be encouraged to take some responsibility for their own learning. The learners themselves have an important role to play to facilitate effective learning, they need to be: o Self motivated o Posses good written and oral communication skills o Able to take responsibility for the learning o Willing to participate and take an active role in their learning process o Committed & disciplined o Acquainted with minimum technology skills o Posses good time management skills o Believers of e-learning 1.7.3 Cost Factor While we have explained that e-learning provides good return of investment it must be stressed that initial costs are high and the cost of developing course content is significant especially if we want good quality content from the e-learning perspective. The expert creating the material not only needs to be a subject expert but also be well versed in utilizing and optimizing the use of technology in effectively capturing the learners’ attention and focus. 1.7.4 Integration Another important challenge facing e-learning is the need to integrate all tools involved including the authoring tools, the learning management systems and other HR applications. There is no ready end-to-end solution that manages all aspects of e-learning. Therefore integration using modules from different vendors is an important aspect of e-learning. Have You Understood? 1. Why is sharing responsibilities with learner considered as an important challenge associated with e-learning? 2. How does use of technologies in e-learning pose a challenge?\n\n16\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n1.8 E-LEARNING INDUSTRY\n\nNOTES\n\nAs you would have understood by now, e-learning is an important aspect of the IT industry and is an important player in the education scenario. We can identify three main segments namely content, technology and services in the e-learning industry. 1.8.1 Content As far as content segment is considered there are Generic Course Providers, Content Developers, Simulation Developers, Test/Assessment Services, Content Aggregators and finally Subject Matter Experts. As you can see the creation of content is an important activity and is supported by many subsidiary services in addition to core subject matter experts. 1.8.2 Technology The systems needed to provide basic administrative as well as infrastructure support are grouped under this segment. These include Learning Management Systems, Content Management Systems, Collaboration Applications, Virtual Classroom Applications, authoring tools and knowledge management systems. 1.8.3 Services Additional services that can be provided include System integrators, content Hosting, Learner Support and mentoring, streaming media authors, learning needs assessors, consultants and knowledge/data providers. Have You Understood? 1. What are the business opportunities of e-learning? 1.9 MODELS OF E-LEARNING One model of teaching and learning online consists of five levels of competence for interactive computer assisted learning. The five levels are: •\n\nLevel 1: Gaining access - Is able to log on and motivated to continue. Posts first ‘joining’ message when instructed.\n\n•\n\nLevel 2: Becoming familiar with the on-line environment -Possesses basic technical skills and is confident in sending and receiving messages to and from tutor and other students.\n\n•\n\nLevel 3: Seeking and giving information - Is confident in using all features of the software. Freely offers, receives and processes information from others on line.\n\n•\n\nLevel 4: Knowledge construction -Demonstrates actions on-line that are likely to lead to ‘knowledge construction’, including 17\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\no Creative and active thinking (asking challenging questions, reflecting, suggesting ideas);\n\nNOTES\n\no Interactive thinking (critiquing, negotiating interpretations, summarizing, proposing actions based on ideas) • Level 5: Autonomy and development - Takes responsibility for own continuing development in on-line learning and is able to set up and support own virtual group. Basically there are two models of imparting knowledge. They are the push model of teaching and the pull model of learning. The push model of teaching is the conventional method of education which is essentially teacher centric. In this model the teacher decides on what and how to impart knowledge and the teaching is pushed to the learners at a centralized location. On the other hand the pull model of learning is learner centric where customized and personalized learning is the norm. E-learning provides exactly this model of imparting knowledge. Viewed from another perspective, the models can be based on the types of e-learning goals. Lessons in e-learning initiatives on one hand, can be aimed at building awareness or providing information, and on the other hand, can be aimed at building specific skills. These goals can be summarized as given in Table 1.3 Table 1.3 Inform and Perform e-learning Goals\n\nGoal\n\nDefinition\n\nExample • •\n\nCompany History New Product Features\n\nPerform - Lessons that build procedural Procedure skills (also called near transfer)\n\n• •\n\nHow to log on How to complete on expense report\n\nPerform Principle\n\n• •\n\nHow to close a sale How to design a Web page\n\nInform\n\nLessons that communicate information\n\nLessons that build principlebased skills (also called as far transfer)\n\nAlthough all e-learning is delivered on a computer, different courses reflect different assumptions of learning. From another perspective, three views about the education process have evolved during the last hundred years of education – information acquisition, learning as response strengthening, and learning as knowledge acquisition (Table 1.4).\n\n18\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nTable 1.4 Three Types of e-learning\n\nType\n\nBuilds Lessons that\n\nReceptive: Information Acquisition Directive: Response Strengthening\n\nInclude lots of information with limited practice opportunities\n\nGuided Discovery: Knowledge Construction\n\nProvide job-realistic problems and supporting resources\n\nNOTES Used for Inform Goals\n\nRequire frequent responses from Performlearners with immediate feedback Procedure Goals PerformPrinciple Goals\n\nHave You Understood? 1. What are the push and pull perspectives of education? 2. What are the three types of e-learning? 1.10 ROI (RETURN ON INVESTMENTS) According to Edward Trolley ROI is perceived customer value over investment. ROI can be defined as the benefit an organization receives for its investment of financial, physical, and human resources. ROI is calculated as ROI = Benefit received - Resources invested Edward Trolley gives another very interesting explanation stating that if you are clear what is that you want to measure; you can go out and measure it. Deciding on what to measure in an education scenario depends on the model of imparting knowledge. Essentially e-learning is a pull model of learning and we need to define parameters we want for this model. Another aspect is that while some argue that Return On Investments (ROI) and monetary terms are important, others argue that e-learning ROI is not about monetary value but is about value of knowledge. ROI can be predictive or historical. For predictive ROI to really work you have to depend on historical data. However in some cases historical data is not available. In such cases we cannot predict a specific ROI. However we can consider experience of other business in similar situations, consider the opinion of e-learning consultants, take factors affecting ROI in traditional learning scenario and make a conservative estimate of the ROI. After a year of operation the predictive ROI can be verified with historical data. Full learning evaluation is really practical. In most cases learning departments have equated ROI with showing that the delivery of e-learning is cheaper per learner than the delivery of instructor led classroom learning. The savings in travel expenses, accommodation and infrastructure costs are easy to demonstrate. 19\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.10.1 Tracking Learner Inputs One perspective of measuring ROI is tracking learner inputs. Some of the aspects that are tracked include: •\n\nNumber of e-learning offerings each learner utilized\n\n•\n\nTotal offerings utilized\n\n•\n\nNumber of programmes /courses registered, completed, passed\n\n•\n\nNumber of logins per course per learner\n\n•\n\nLength of attendance per session\n\n•\n\nTotal hours logged per month for individual learner\n\n•\n\nPercentage of learner’s curriculum completed\n\n•\n\nType of delivery utilized\n\nA large amount of information can be gathered from learner’s inputs and demographics. However if in an industry you are proposing to introduce e-learning as a mechanism to enhance the capabilities of your employees, then just tracking learners inputs is not sufficient. In such cases you need to factor into ROI the impact of e-learning, such as increase in size and frequency of orders, reduction in wastage, increased repeat business, lower inventory levels etc.. In other words, e-learning has to improve the organization’s performance and e-learning then is about outcomes not inputs. From the viewpoint of e-learning forming a part of a regular university’s offerings, what are to be measured is the efficiency and the profit in such offerings. However if elearning is part of the learning department of an enterprise then effectiveness is the most important criteria, that is the business performance enhancement as a result of e-learning. 1.10.2 Kirkpatrick Model for Evaluation of Learning Donald Kirkpatrick designed a model for the evaluation of learning which was adopted in 1997 by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD). The levels of the model have been considered as taxonomy of learning evaluation. The following (Table 1.5) are the levels of the model and the series of questions associated with each level.\n\n20\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nTable 1.5 Kirkpatrick’s Levels of Evaluation\n\nLevel Name Number Level 1 Reaction : a measure of learner satisfaction Level 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLearning : a measure of learning\n\nNOTES\n\nQuestions • • • •\n\n• Behavior: a • measure of • behavior change Results: a measure • of results •\n\nDid the learners like it? What do you plan to do with what they have planned? (for organizations) Did the earners get it? Have their skills, knowledge or attitudes changed as a result? How much have they changed? Can the learners go out and do it? Has the behavior changed as a result of learning? Do the learners use what they have learned? Does the change in their behavior have a positive and measurable impact on the business?\n\nAs you can see the model is about evaluating learning from the perspective of an organization and the effectiveness of the learning process to improve the performance of the organization. Now the question is whether the model described by Kirkpatrick is applicable to e-learning. Kirkpatrick views the web as another learning channel and declares that his model of evaluation fits e-learning as well. Kirkpatrick’s model is characterized by four levels of evaluation and views the learning process as a holistic coherent process. Therefore the model is sometimes viewed as a framework or taxonomy rather than a model. Most courses are evaluated at level one and almost none at level four because of the complexity of evaluation as you move up the levels. 1.10.2.1 Collecting Data In one sense in the model cumulative data from each level is carried forward to the next level. As we move up the level, collecting fresh data becomes more time-consuming and expensive. Data for level 1 is the most easiest to collect. Most learning programmes have a simple questionnaire that the learner completes. This questionnaire is also called as smile sheet. The purpose of the smile sheet is to determine whether the learners enjoyed the learning experience and whether it was relevant to them. However smile sheets elicit subjective data and may reflect personal opinions unconnected to the performance related course objectives. The problem is that most learners answer questions with answers such as the course met their expectations. However to understand this, we need to know what the expectations are. 21\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nData for level 2 evaluations are usually collected by analyzing pre and post course assignments. Data collection for level 3 is more time consuming and include interviews with learners, the learners’ managers etc. Level 4 evaluates the impact of the learning programmes on performance for example, reduce in wastage, increased orders, etc. Level 4 evaluates the positive and measurable impact of the changed learner behavior on the business goals. In other words level 4 actually measures Return on Expectation or ROE. Level 4 data is actually available and recorded by other normal business processes. Effective collection of such data before and after the learning process and comparison of such data sets is the job of the level 4 evaluator. 1.10.2.2 Adding a New Level In 1996 Jack Phillips updated Kirkpatrick’s model by adding a fifth level of Evaluation – return on investment. The new level poses the question: “Did the monetary value of the results exceed the cost of the training?” Positive results at levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 is irrelevant if it fails at level 5 that is at the ROI level. In other words the organization will not be willing to invest in a positive impact on business if the cost of that impact exceeds the benefits. Moving a learning department from efficiency mode to effectiveness mode with a measurable ROI is essential for the success of the learning process. 1.10.2.3 Implementation Guidelines We need to use the four levels of Kirkpatrick’ model along with Philip’s Fifth level of ROI in order to evaluate e-learning. Kirkpatrick himself has outlined some implementation guidelines level by level as given in Table 1.6. 1.10.3 Defining Costs In order to answer the question whether the monetary value of the results exceeds the cost of training, we need to consider three issues: •\n\nCost of developing and delivering e-learning. Laurie Bassi analyses learning development and delivery costs and breaks them into direct costs, indirect costs and opportunity.\n\n•\n\nReturn of benefits\n\n•\n\nPeriod for which the benefits are calculated\n\n1.10.3.1 Direct Costs According to Bassi, the direct costs of learning can be divided into two components as classroom costs and e-learning costs. Classroom costs include wages and salaries of trainers, payments to outside vendors, facilities expenses, cost of development, production and distribution of materials, travel expenses and administrative and support costs. Elearning costs include development costs, purchase and licensing of software and hardware\n\n22\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nfor delivery. Infrastructure costs do not form part of costs as a network capable of delivering e-learning is assumed to be in place.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe fixed cost of e-learning includes content development which includes intellectual property development and licenses, instructional design, studio costs and programming costs. The content may be developed for tens or thousands of users, however the initial development cost remains the same. Sometimes the development costs can include extending or upgrading the network. These costs must be spread over all the courses offered since all the courses benefit from the improved infrastructure. Fixed costs of e-learning are much higher compared to that of classroom learning. This higher cost is due to the more sophisticated resources and technology required to develop e-learning content. The variable or marginal costs of classroom learning are directly proportional to the number of learners. On the other hand, the variable costs of e-learning are negligible. Normally stepped costs are not associated with e-learning. However a large increase in the number of learners can result in increase in distribution and server up-gradation costs. The size of the virtual classroom can also result in stepped costs. The usual norm is to have one instructor for every 20 learners to ensure effective interaction. When the size of the virtual classroom increases, it is advisable to have one assistant instructor for every additional 20 learners. The assistant instructors can prioritize questions and leave the instructor free to effectively teach the content. The cost of the additional assistant instructors is more than compensated by the savings in travel and opportunity costs of the learners.

Normally opportunity costs are equal to or greater than indirect costs. Opportunity costs can be very high if the learner works in sales and marketing. In the case of e-learning because it is time-effective and avoids learning related travel, opportunity costs are much lower than classroom learning. It is often claimed that the indirect costs of e-learning is three to five times lower than that of classroom learning. E-learning reduces costs in general but especially reduces indirect and opportunity costs. 1.10.3.4 Costs: Classroom Learning versus E-learning In order to compare the costs of classroom learning and e-learning we need to find out about the value of each hour of learning in both cases. It is claimed that one hour of self-paced e-learning is about 25% to 60% more time effective than one hour of instructor led classroom learning. Laurie Bassi has developed a worksheet for comparing the costs of traditional learning and e-learning. E-learning is more cost effective than traditional learning. For e-learning costs of trainer’s compensation, material development, production and distribution, travel expenses, learner’s compensation and opportunity cost. are considered 24\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\ninsignificant by Bassi. Bassi has considered material development costs as marginal since development costs do not increase as the number of learners increase. Sometimes more investment is made in course content development where the learner base is large. For traditional learning the hardware and software costs are considered insignificant.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.10.4 ROI Calculation In order to calculate ROI, we need to first determine the total cost an e-learning process. The total cost is calculated as follows: Total Cost = all fixed costs + ( number of learners x variable cost) ROI is calculated as ROI = Customer defined value / Total cost This definition of ROI, stresses the fact that ROI is defined by the customer’s business requirements. ROI can also be expressed as a percentage, Net Monetary benefits /costs x 100 = ROI (%) (Monetary benefits – Total cost of learning)/Total cost of learning x 100 = ROI(%) In addition to the definition with cost-benefit ratio, time can also be considered as a parameter Cost/Benefit x period = Time to break even Example An organization launches a new product that is very different from anything currently available. However, the launch fails. It was then found out that the sales team found it difficult to explain clearly the benefits of the new product to the customers. In this scenario, the learning department is required to develop a learning program comprising 1 hour virtual class and 3 hour self paced e-learning program to educate the sales personnel about the new features of the product. The product being new, it has to be developed from scratch. We also assume the infrastructure is already in place and so there is no additional cost. We also assume that the learning process takes place during early morning hours so that it does not in most cases effect client servicing. In this way the opportunity costs were reduced. Information Given: Cost of developing material for Virtual Classroom\n\n= Rs. 5,00,000\n\nCost of developing self paced Programme (for 3 Hours)\n\n= Rs.45,00,000\n\nAfter six months half yearly profit target was found to be\n\n= Rs. 75,00,00,000\n\nand the contribution due to the learning initiative was judged as 5%. 25\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nHave You Understood? 1.

What are differences between direct, indirect and opportunity costs? 1.11 E-LEARNING CYCLE 1.11.1 Closed-loop Structure: One important point to note is that e-learning is a continuous process. In e-learning we implement once but actually deliver multiple times, in other words there is continuous delivery of e-learning. This continuous process has been depicted by a closed-loop structure by Jay W.Forrester as given in Figure 1.5.\n\nFig. 1.5 Closed-Loop Structure 1.11.2 Learnativity Spiral Forrester has described e-learning as a continuous reaction to one’s own actions and to the actions of others. Wayne Hodgins has described this aspect using a spiral which he called as learnativity spiral (Figure 1.6). This spiral is closely related to the closed-loop structure. Hodgins describes learnativity as the continuous conversion of tacit knowledge (such as know how and experience) into explicit knowledge that can be captured, shared and diffused and continuously create new actionable knowledge. Learnativity actually defines a spiraling effect where there is conversion and interaction between the tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge as we move from one level to the next in the spiral. The various stages in a level are capture, manage, learn and perform. Capture essentially entails 26\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\nunderstanding the tacit knowledge from different available sources. The manage stage attempts to convert explicit knowledge into various forms that can be conveniently shared. In the e-learning scenario this involves deciding curricula, learning paths, and all other activities involved in facilitating the learning process. Learn stage is the actually learning process utilizing all resources and facilities available at one’s disposal. Finally in the perform stage, what has been learned is applied to solve problems at all levels – individual, team and enterprise.\n\nNOTES\n\nFig. 1.6 Learnativity Spiral 1.11.3 Double Loop Learning Closed single loop structure does not attain the ultimate goal of learning which is to transform the way the enterprise operates. The closed loop although self-correcting and self-improving, is also self-limiting. In other words the closed loop learning cycle and the mandate or governing programme do not interact and are independent structures. •\n\nTherefore the double loop learning was defined by Christopher Argyris, Professor of Education at Harvard University. The main characteristic of double loop learning is essentially a feedback to the governing programme which allows for evolution. Double loop learning evaluates the learning process and provides effective feedback in accordance with the overall objectives resulting in a new framework for learning. In addition, for e-learning to be effective it must be possible to revisit and revise the original drivers based on the implementation of the learning process.\n\n27\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.11.4 Domains of learning •\n\nBusiness Domain – where Capture and Manage stages of learnativity takes place. This domain provides context, the e-learning content and the delivery channels.\n\n•\n\nLearner Domain – where Learn and Perform stages of learnativity takes place. The learner provides another type of content in the form of knowledge experience questions and real time learning. This domain is responsible for feedback and evaluation. Facilitating e-learning is one aspect but finally the learner is responsible for the learning process.\n\nThe two domains discussed have different but related cycles. Business Domain Cycles: Business Domain Cycles provides context, infrastructure and content •\n\nResponsibility – business & learning department\n\n•\n\nLearner involved only in evaluation\n\nComponents of Business Domain Learning Cycle: 1\n\nAlign with business strategy and objectives: •\n\nObjective – to ensure that all members of the enterprise are enabled to work to their best potential through the e-learning process.\n\n•\n\nChanging Requirements – e-learning should be able to modify its objectives to suit the changing agenda & requirements of the enterprise.\n\n2 Establish competencies and Performance targets • 3\n\nSupport for Business Objectives – components and levels of performance as required for each role in the enterprise\n\nMeasure performance gaps •\n\nDetermine Performance gaps – quantify what exists and measure performance gaps.\n\n•\n\nMeasurements - on predictive basis – by making employees perform Competency and activity assessments.\n\n•\n\nSome Learning Management Systems – competency models have competency modules – allow assessments Online – gather data and analyze automatically.\n\n•\n\nCan also be observed operationally by managers\n\n4. Set Learning Objectives – learning objectives for learning paths and individual courses to close the performance gaps 5. Capture Tacit knowledge – work with internal or external subject experts to capture tacit knowledge.\n\n28\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n6. Design/Develop or buy learning content - start designing and develop learning Content – if possible save time and money by buying off-the-shelf content. Content development is itself a recursive process involving preliminary designing, detailed designing, developing content, reviewing quality, conducting technical tests, performing user acceptance tests, modifying design. 7. Deliver Learning – is an important activity and you need to leverage the whole learning value chain using both off line processes and managed processes – delivering self paced courses, simulations, archived web casts and peer-to-peer platforms through off line mode and virtual classes, mentoring, live web casts and classroom-based learning through appropriate learning management systems. 8. Evaluate Learning – the e-learning needs to be properly evaluated especially in terms of how it affects the next stage in the Business Domain cycle. 9. Reflect and make adjustments – this is a critical stage – and involves in examining the various parameters at each stage and making adjustments as and when necessary.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.11.5 Learner Domain Cycles • Learner Domain Cycles is where the learning happens – in a classroom, an aircraft, learner’s office, factory floor, client site or in a hotel room. • Learning often happens after the learning event – where learner assimilates content by applying in a work context. • If learning is instructor led – some control by the business domain is possible. •\n\nMost e-learning systems – this is not possible\n\nLearning Cycles: Kolb and Fry: suggested a four stage learning cycle for experimental learning. The learning cycle can begin at any of the four stages. The four stages are: •\n\nExperience – immersing yourself in the learning\n\n•\n\nReflection – the aspects that you notice\n\n•\n\nConceptualization – the meaning of what you see\n\n•\n\nPlanning – what will happen next and what are the activities that will follow\n\nHoney and Mumford: suggested a learning cycle that accounts for the different preferences of learners for different stages in the learning cycle suggested by Kolb. These preferences are called learning styles. At different points in time in spite of individual preferences, in order to complete learning, the learner has to adopt every role in the learning cycle – •\n\nStage 1- Activist – Having an experience\n\n•\n\nStage 2 – Reflector – Reviewing the experience\n\n•\n\nStage 3 – Theorist – concluding from the experience\n\n•\n\nStage 4 – Pragmatist – Planning the next steps 29\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nDouble-loop Cycle: Both the Kolb and Fry cycle and Honey and Mumford cycle are single loop processes. However, if there is a failure in the learning process, or in other words, the employee’s performance does not improve there is no method to help in diagnosing the failure. The cycles assume that the learner is motivated and the content is fit for the purpose it is intended. If these assumptions prove to be wrong there must be a method to influence the Business Domain to correct these assumptions. The new learning cycle for the Learner Domain needs to be aware of the context of the Business Domain and support double-loop learning ( Figure 1.7). Four new stages and roles support doubleloop learning.\n\nFig. 1.7 Learner domain E-learning cycle Have You Understood? 1. Why is e-learning considered as a spiral? 2.

An important feature is that drivers change as corporate strategy changes. When first building a case for e-learning you need to stress that these are the initial drivers pertinent to that period and caters to priority business requirements for which e-learning can deliver a solution. Since e-learning is designed to tackle issues that pertain to specific and changing business requirements, there is no methodology that fits all scenarios. From one perspective, a general view on the drivers for e-learning is as given in Table The drivers in the implementation of e-learning can be looked at from the viewpoints of the different stakeholders:\n\n32\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n•\n\nSenior Executives\n\n•\n\nMiddle Level Executives\n\n•\n\nLearners and HR personnel\n\nNOTES\n\n1.12.1 Drivers for Senior Executives The drivers for senior executives are summarized in Table 1.8 1.12.2 Drivers for Middle level Executives The drivers for middle management are summarized in Table 1.9 Table 1.9 Drivers for middle level executives S.No\n\nDriver\n\nDescription\n\n1.\n\nMeeting Targets\n\nThe competency and performance management systems of e-learning help to recruit new talent and identify the best qualified staff Continuous customized learning can ensure peak performance of each staff member\n\n2.\n\nCustomer Proactive behavior - anticipating issues and Satisfaction delivering solutions can improve customer satisfaction.

What are the main drivers of e-learning? 2. Who are considered the major stakeholders in the implementation of e-learning? 3. What are the drivers for Learning and HR departments? 1.13 E-LEARNING STRATEGY An enterprise e-learning provides an objective vision and framework for the implementation process. The framework is an analysis which provides some guiding principles for the dimensions of e-learning: • Business needs – this is the driver of change • Technology – this is the enabler of change • Content – this is the agent of change •\n\nCorporate culture – this is the arena of change 33\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nTable 1.10 Drivers for Learning and HR departments\n\nNOTES\n\nAn e-learning strategy operates at both micro and macro levels. Some of the important questions to be considered include: •\n\nWhat are the business reasons?\n\n•\n\nWhat is the right way to operate?\n\n•\n\nWhat are the financial implications?\n\nThe e-learning implementation must have all stakeholders sharing the same objective and vision so that a coherent strategy evolves which is most likely to obtain funding.\n\n34\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n1.13.1 Iterative process – the strategy\n\nNOTES\n\nE-learning strategy is not a static process and can fail the first time. The main reasons for this are: •\n\nFailure to manage Technology - keep abreast developments in e-learning products, services and technology\n\n•\n\nFailure to respond to changing business needs – respond quickly to changes in business requirements\n\nTo cope up with these changes there is a need to have an iterative process in place that constantly reexamines every aspect of the strategy whenever internal or external changes take place. In certain circumstances where a crisis in the enterprise calls for e-learning as a potential solution, then we know exactly what is required and the well defined problem dictates a rapid e-learning implementation. 1.13.2 Alignment The e-learning strategy enables the enterprise to achieve its objectives within the environment in which it operates. The e-learning strategy needs to be in tune with all other strategies operating in the enterprise to achieve the same objectives. The other strategies most likely to be operating include: •\n\nBusiness strategy: caters to the goals of the enterprise – decides how to compete in the market and plans to increase profit. This strategy drives all other strategies.\n\n•\n\nE-Business Strategy: This strategy decides on the infrastructure, processes and priorities for connecting every entity to every other entity – e-learning & e-business strategies should be aligned.\n\n•\n\nHuman Resources Strategy: The Human resource strategies determines how the enterprise should invest in human capital so as to achieve the business objective and how best to leverage this capital in order to execute the business strategy. There is a natural alignment between this strategy and learning.\n\n•\n\nKnowledge Management: Viewed from an abstract perspective, both Knowledge Management and e-learning is about capturing tacit expert knowledge and transforming into an explicit form so that it can be effectively disseminated. Again natural alignment between this and e-learning.\n\n•\n\nIT Strategy: The technology used for e-learning should be in tune with technology used for other business processes – approved technology vendors and infrastructure evolution.\n\nFinally learning and e-learning are methods of delivery of knowledge and hence the two must be in perfect alignment and must have the same general aim of improving the performance of the enterprise by improving the performance of the individual.\n\n35\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\n1.13.3 Barriers •\n\nThe e-learning industry: The availability of large Learning Management System by a reputed vendor may seem to be the perfect solution to meet your e-learning needs. However it is best to have a clear idea of your requirements before looking at readymade solutions. In order to have a clear picture of the kind of elearning system you need the following questions need to be answered: o What is the direction your business is going to take? o What is the geographic spread? o Are staffing requirements likely to rise significantly? o Is staff attrition high? o Are product cycles getting shorter? o Is competition becoming an issue? o Is there increasing emphasis on outsourcing? o Is there increasing emphasis on cost reduction?\n\n•\n\nTime: A perfect excuse to avoid developing a coherent e-learning strategy is lack of time. However this is not true since issues not addressed at the strategy development time gets deferred not solved. Often a good strategy will bring a focus into your thinking process which will help in all later stages of the e-learning implementation. As an example, a request for information (RFI) and a request for purchase (RFP) are required when interacting with vendors, a better RFI and RFP can be obtained if the strategy is in place.\n\n1.13.4 The process of deciding a strategy Steps: 1. Formation of e-learning group: Choose from members •\n\nInterested or have experience in e-learning\n\n•\n\nAre Representatives of the enterprise\n\n•\n\nNot all from learning department ( will narrow the scope)\n\n2. Use formal or informal surveys to gather information about adoption of e-learning. Recruit people with positive experience in e-learning as champions of elearning. Find out any local e-learning experiences. 3. Involve Stakeholders in harnessing support for the e-learning initiative and develop coherent strategy through a process of discussion, discovery and dialogue. The stakeholders include senior management, e-learning steering group, IT department, Knowledge management department, e-learning team, internal clients, internal and external certification and compliance regulators, subject matter experts, tutors, managers, learners, partners, sales channels, suppliers, customers etc.\n\n36\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n4.

It distinguishes the role of the inst instructor in e-learning in comparison to the role of the instructor in traditional learning methodology. Then it explains the different learning theories and discusses how these learning theories form the basis of instructional design. It then goes on to explain Learning Object and its role in instructional design in the context of elearning. Finally the Unit discusses some issues of e-learning. 2.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVES •\n\nTo discuss aspects in the design of e-learning content\n\n•\n\nTo understand the changing role of the instructor in e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo explain some typical learning theories\n\n•\n\nTo learn about instructional design\n\n•\n\nTo define learning objects\n\n•\n\nTo outline the instructional design principles for e-learning\n\n•\n\nTo discuss issues associated with e-learning\n\n2.3 DESIGN OF E-LEARNING CONTENT An important component of any e-learning initiative is the design and implementation of the learning content. From the viewpoint of e-learning, learning design incorporates two aspects – the what - that is the actual content to be delivered and how – that is the sequence of learning activities. Another aspect to be considered is the reusability of the learning content and sequences. In other words when designing material for e-learning, the following aspects are involved: •\n\nCreate content-based, self-paced learning objects\n\n•\n\nCreate sequences of learning activities which involve groups of learners interacting within a structured set of collaborative environments\n\n•\n\nCreate Learning objects and sequences that are reusable 41\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nImportant aspects of creation of such learning content, and structuring of the learning activities is the achievement of the final objectives of enabling learners to construct their own knowledge and understanding. 2.4 ROLE OF THE TUTOR The role of the tutor in e-learning is vastly different from the role of the tutor in traditional learning. The activities of the tutor in the e-learning scenario include the following: •\n\nPlanning phase\n\n•\n\nContinuous Monitoring of the learning activity\n\n•\n\nPost-delivery review and quality check\n\n•\n\nOrganizational responsibilities as e-tutor include o Content facilitator o Resource provider o Overall e-learning activity manager and administrator\n\nThe Tutor must also ensure that the complete learning activity caters to all different types and levels of learners that they are likely to encounter. The planning phase is an important activity of the tutor and the key issues to be considered include: •\n\nAudience\n\n•\n\nResource Needs\n\n•\n\nProposed learning outcomes\n\n•\n\nAssessments needs and methods\n\n2.4.1 Audience •\n\nPrior learning related to current learning\n\n•\n\nDevelopment Special competencies if required\n\n•\n\nKeep tracking on the dynamic needs and characteristics of the learners so that it is always matching the learners requirement\n\n2.4.2 Resource needs The tutor must be aware of what resources are available and how the students can access them. Access privileges for easily available online resources needs to be acquired. As far as possible it is better to avoid conventional type of resources such as text books, videos, etc. since these resources cannot be accessed easily by the e-learners since they cannot be readily dispatched on request.\n\n42\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n2.4.3 Proposed Learning Needs\n\nNOTES\n\nA learning scenario whether traditional or Online must necessarily have a learning outcome. Learning outcomes can be of various types such as: • Outcomes which are specific in nature for example where students are required to master a particular mathematical concept • Outcomes can be general in nature such as acquiring high level skills such as understanding a play • Outcomes can be expressive requiring learners to acquire creative skills such as singing or painting The tutor must clearly specify the outcomes of the learning process whatever may be nature of the learning outcomes. 2.4.4 Assessments needs and methods An important component of learning is the evaluation or assessment process. Normal procedures of assessment in an e-learning scenario include tests, creating portfolio or submitting assignments. However almost all subjectively assessed work such as essays, assignments, project reports etc. must necessarily again be finally evaluated by the human evaluator. E-learning can help in the interaction between learner and tutor more or less acting as a messenger for submitting assignments, reporting results and collecting feedback. For objective type of evaluation such as multiple choice and structured questions there exist automatic modes of evaluation. There are also evaluations which need to physically access the objects such as paintings, or performance such as dancing, traditional methods of submission are required. Therefore the tutor needs to plan in advance the type of evaluation and the methodology of interaction. Have you understood? 1. What are the organizational responsibilities of the tutor? 2. List the issues key issues in planning of an e-learning course by the tutor or instructor 3. What are the various types of learning outcomes? 4. What are the typical assessment strategies used in e-learning? 2.5 INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN 2.5.1 Introduction Instruction design is concerned with research and theory about learning and teaching strategies and the methodologies used in developing and implementing these strategies specifically in the context of e-learning.\n\n43\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\nBiggs (1999) describes the task of good pedagogical design as one of ensuring that there are absolutely no inconsistencies between the curriculum we teach, the teaching methods we use, the learning environment we choose, and the assessment procedures we adopt. •\n\nTo achieve complete consistency, we need to examine very carefully what assumptions we are making at each stage. We also need to align these assumptions.\n\n•\n\nWe need to start with carefully defined intended learning outcomes, we then need to choose learning and teaching activities that stand a good chance of allowing the students to achieve these learning outcomes.\n\n•\n\nWe then need to design assessment tasks which will genuinely test whether the outcomes have been reached. This process is easy to state, but very hard to achieve in an informed way.\n\nInstructional design helps the teaching and learning process so that education experiences are optimized for particular learning goals. Each and every teacher is in essence involved with instructional design since they plan their education interventions. All activities in the teaching learning process such as giving lecture to conducting an assignment is an intervention benefit from instructional design. The traditional role of instructional design is ‘to bridge the distance between the student, the instructor, and the learning organization’ Shearer (2003). There are two types of distances - physical or transactional. •\n\nPhysical distance – specifies the actual extent of physical vicinity between the teacher and the learner\n\n•\n\nTransactional distance is the ‘communications distance’between the teaching faculty or ‘the degree to which a distance student perceives the availability of and connectedness with the teacher, other learners and the institution’ in their course (Shin 2002).\n\n•\n\nReducing the transactional distance between the teacher and the learner improves student achievement\n\n•\n\nJust physical proximity does not ensure less transactional distance. Even if a course is delivered on-campus and in person by the teacher, the transactional distance between the teacher and the learner may encourage real communications and cognitive engagement beyond the structured lecture.\n\n•\n\nLarge class numbers and highly structured learning environments increase transactional distance.\n\nOne of the major goals of instructional design is to minimize the transactional distance between student and the teacher and the other parties involved in the teaching learning process. In the case of e-learning, the goal of instructional design is to minimize the transactional distance in spite of the physical distance making use of the different mix of media available. 44\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n2.5.2 The Psychological Theory Underpinning Educational Design •\n\nThere are distinct traditions in educational theory that are derived from different perspectives about the nature of learning itself.\n\n•\n\nThree clusters or broad perspectives, which make fundamentally different assumptions about what is crucial for understanding learning, have been identified. These are:\n\nNOTES\n\no The associationist/empiricist perspective (learning as activity) o The cognitive perspective (learning as achieving understanding) o The situative perspective (learning as social practice) •\n\nWe consider how each of these perspectives have contributed differently to the design cycle of specifying learning outcomes, designing learning environments and teaching methods, and deriving appropriate assessment.\n\n2.5.2.1 The Associationist/Empiricist Perspective • In this approach, knowledge is an organized accumulation of associations and skill components. • Learning is the process of connecting the elementary mental or behavioral units, through sequences of activity. • This view encompasses the research traditions of associationism, behaviorism and connectionism (neural networks). • Associationist theory requires subject matter to be analysed as specific associations, expressed as behavioral objectives. • This kind of analysis was developed by Gagn (1985) into an elaborate system of instructional task analysis of discriminations, classifications and response sequences. • Learning tasks are arranged in sequences based on their relative complexity according to a task analysis, with simpler components as pre-requisites for more complex tasks. • The neural network approach views knowledge states as represented by patterns of activation in a network of elementary units. This approach has not yet been applied widely to educational issues, but is potentially significant. It suggests an analysis of knowledge in terms of attunement to regularities in the patterns of activities, rather than in terms of components, as traditional task analysis requires. • Viewed from this perspective, learning is the formation, strengthening and adjustment of associations, particularly through the reinforcement of particular connections through feedback. • One implication is the individualizing of instruction, where each student responds actively to questions or problems and receives immediate feedback on their response. This has underpinned the development of programmed instruction and computer programmes that teach routine skills. The shaping of responses through selective reinforcement relates to instruction-by-approximation (in classroom contexts skilled teachers provide encouragement as students achieve better approximation to the required patterns of performance). Analysis of complex tasks 45\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nDMC 1645\n\nNOTES\n\ninto learning hierarchies – the decomposition hypothesis – involves the assumption that smaller units need to be mastered as a prerequisite for more complex units. Thus sequences of instruction are designed for students to be able to succeed by learning in small and logically-ordered steps. 2.5.2.2 The Cognitive Perspective • As part of a general shift in theoretical positioning in psychology starting in the 1960s, learning, as well as perception, thinking, language and reasoning became seen as the output of an individual’s attention, memory and concept formation processes. • This approach provided a basis for analyzing concepts and procedures of subject matter curricula in terms of information structures, and gave rise to new approaches to pedagogy. • Within this broad perspective, particular sub-areas of cognitive research can be highlighted as particularly influential, e.g.: schema theory, information processing theories of problem solving and reasoning, levels of processing in memory, general competencies for thinking, mental models, and meta-cognitive processes. • The underlying theme for learning is to model the processes of interpreting and constructing meaning, and a particular emphasis was placed on the instantiation of models of knowledge acquisition in the form of computer programmes (e.g.: Newell, 1990).\n\nFig. 2.1 Cognitive Approach to Learning 46\n\nANNA UNIVERSITY CHENNAI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO E-LEARNING\n\n•\n\nKnowledge acquisition was viewed as the outcome of an interaction between new experiences and the structures for understanding that have already been created.\n\n•\n\nSo building a framework for understanding becomes the learner’s key cognitive challenge.\n\n•\n\nThis kind of thinking stood in sharp contrast to the model of learning as the strengthening of associations.\n\n•\n\nThe cognitive account saw knowledge acquisition as proceeding from a declarative form to a procedural, compiled form.\n\n•\n\nA view of cognitive approach is given in Figure 2.1\n\n•\n\nAs performance becomes more expert-like and fluent, the component skills become automated. Thus, conscious attention is no longer required "
