The parties agree as follows:\n\n1 ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TERMS\n\nAccounting terms not defined in this Agreement shall be construed following GAAP. Calculations and determinations must be made following GAAP. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13. All other terms contained in this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, shall have the meaning provided by the Code to the extent such terms are defined therein.\n\n2 LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT\n\n2.1 Promise to Pay. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay Bank the outstanding principal amount of all Credit Extensions and accrued and unpaid interest thereon as and when due in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n2.1.1 Revolving Advances.\n\n(a) Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to deduction of reserves (including but not limited to the Letter of Credit Reserve and the FX Reserve), Bank will make Advances to Borrower up to an amount (\"Net Borrowing Availability\") not to exceed the lesser of (a) the Revolving Line; or (b) amounts available under the Borrowing Base. Amounts borrowed under this Section may be repaid and reborrowed during the term of this Agreement.\n\n(b) Termination; Repayment. The Revolving Line terminates on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, when the principal amount of all Advances, the unpaid interest thereon, and all other Obligations relating to the Revolving Line shall be immediately due and payable.\n\n2.1.2 Letters of Credit Sublimit.\n\n(a) As part of the Revolving Line, Bank shall issue or have issued Letters of Credit for Borrower's account. The face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve) may not exceed: (a) the Net Borrowing Availability minus the sum of (i) all amounts for services utilized under the Cash Management Services Sublimit, (ii) the FX Reserve, and (iii) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the Advances; and (b) $5,000,000 minus the sum of (i) all amounts for services utilized under the Cash Management Services Sublimit and (ii) the FX Reserve. Such aggregate amounts utilized hereunder shall at all times reduce the amount otherwise available for Advances under the Revolving Line. If, on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, there are any outstanding Letters of Credit, then on such date Borrower shall provide to Bank cash collateral in an amount equal to 105% of the face amount of all such Letters of Credit plus all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as estimated by Bank in its good faith business judgment), to secure all of the Obligations relating to said Letters of Credit. All Letters of Credit shall be in form and substance acceptable to Bank in its sole discretion and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Bank's standard Application and Letter of Credit Agreement (the \"Letter of Credit Application\"). Borrower agrees to execute any further documentation in connection with the Letters of Credit as Bank may reasonably request. If there is any conflict between the terms of the Loan Documents and terms of the Letter of Credit Application and such other documentation, the terms of the Loan Documentation shall control. Borrower further agrees to be bound by the regulations and interpretations of the issuer of any Letters of Credit guarantied by Bank and opened for Borrower's account or by Bank's interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Bank for Borrower's account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Bank shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrower's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto.\n\n(b) The obligation of Borrower to immediately reimburse Bank for drawings made under Letters of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letters of Credit, and the Letter of Credit Application.\n\n(c) Borrower may request that Bank issue a Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign Currency. If a demand for payment is made under any such Letter of Credit, Bank shall treat such demand as an Advance to Borrower of the equivalent of the amount thereof (plus fees and charges in connection therewith such as wire, cable, SWIFT or similar charges) in Dollars at the then-prevailing rate of exchange in San Francisco, California, for sales of the Foreign Currency for transfer to the country issuing such Foreign Currency.\n\n(d) To guard against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign Currency, Bank shall create a reserve (the \"Letter of Credit Reserve\") under the Revolving Line in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit. The amount of the Letter of Credit Reserve may be adjusted by Bank from time to time to account for fluctuations in the exchange rate. The availability of funds under the Revolving Line shall be reduced by the amount of such Letter of Credit Reserve for as long as such Letter of Credit remains outstanding.\n\n2.1.3 Foreign Exchange Sublimit. As part of the Revolving Line, Borrower may enter into foreign exchange contracts with Bank under which Borrower commits to purchase from or sell to Bank a specific amount of Foreign Currency (each, a \"FX Forward Contract\") on a specified date (the \"Settlement Date\"). FX Forward Contracts shall have a Settlement Date of at least one (1) FX Business Day after the contract date and shall be subject to a reserve of ten percent (10%) of each outstanding FX Forward Contract, the maximum aggregate amount of which reserve may not exceed $5,000,000 minus the sum of (a) all amounts for services utilized under the Cash Management Services Sublimit, and (b) the amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit) (the \"FX Reserve\"). The aggregate amount of FX Forward Contracts at any one time may not exceed ten (10) times the amount of the FX Reserve. The FX Reserve may not exceed the Availability Amount (but without including the FX Reserve in the calculation thereof).\n\n2.1.4 Cash Management Services Sublimit. Borrower may use up to $5,000,000 minus the sum of (a) the amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit), and (b) the FX Reserve (the \"Cash Management Services Sublimit\") of the Revolving Line for Bank's cash management services which may include merchant services, direct deposit of payroll, business credit card, automated clearing house transactions, controlled disbursement accounts, and check cashing services identified in Bank's various cash management services agreements (collectively, the \"Cash Management Services\"); provided that in no event shall the Cash Management Services Sublimit exceed the Availability Amount (but without including amounts for services utilized under the Cash Management Services Sublimit in the calculation thereof). Any amounts Bank pays on behalf of Borrower or any amounts that are not paid by Borrower for any Cash Management Services will be treated as Advances under the Revolving Line and will accrue interest at the interest rate applicable to Advances.\n\n2.1.5 Term Loan.\n\n(a) Availability. Bank shall make one (1) term loan available to Borrower in an amount up to the Term Loan Amount on the Effective Date subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n(b) Application of Term Loan. The Term Loan shall be used to repay in full the Prior Loans. For administrative convenience, Bank may credit the Prior Loans against the amount of the Term Loan to be made available by Bank hereunder. Any excess of the Term Loan after repayment of the Prior Loans shall be disbursed to Borrower, which Borrower shall use in accordance with Section 5.10 hereof.\n\n(c) Repayment. Borrower shall repay the Term Loan in thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments of principal, plus interest (the \"Term Loan Payment\"). Beginning the month following the month in which the Funding Date of the Term Loan occurs (or in the case where such Funding Date occurs on the last day of the month, beginning the second month thereafter) each Term Loan Payment shall be payable on the first day of each month; Borrower's final Term Loan Payment, due on the Term Loan Maturity Date, shall include all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Term Loan. Borrower may not re-borrow any amount of the Term Loan that is repaid hereunder. Borrower may prepay amounts due and owing under the Term Loan at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty except as set forth in Section 4.1 hereof.\n\n2.2 Overadvances. If at any time or for any reason the total of all outstanding Advances and all other monetary Obligations under Section 2.1.2, 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 exceeds Net Borrowing Availability (an \"Overadvance\"), Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of the excess to Bank, without notice or demand. Without limiting Borrower's obligation to repay to Bank the amount of any Overadvance, Borrower agrees to pay Bank interest on the outstanding amount of any Overadvance, on demand, at the Default Rate.\n\n-2-\n\n2.3 Payment of Interest on the Credit Extensions.\n\n(a) Interest Rate; Advances. Subject to Section 2.3(b), the amounts outstanding under the (i) Revolving Line shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to one quarter of one percentage point (0.25) above the Prime Rate, and (ii) Term Loan shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to one half of one percentage point (0.50) above the Prime Rate, which interest in each case shall be payable monthly.\n\n(b) Default Rate. Immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligations shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is five percentage points above the rate effective immediately before the Event of Default (the \"Default Rate\"). Payment or acceptance of the increased interest rate provided in this Section 2.3(b) is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Bank.\n\n(c) Adjustment to Interest Rate. Changes to the interest rate of any Credit Extension based on changes to the Prime Rate shall be effective on the effective date of any change to the Prime Rate and to the extent of any such change.\n\n(d) 360-Day Year. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.\n\n(e) Debit of Accounts. In accordance with Section 9.4, Bank may debit any of Borrower's deposit accounts, including the Designated Deposit Account, for principal and interest payments or any other amounts Borrower owes Bank when due. These debits shall not constitute a set-off.\n\n(f) Payment; Interest Computation; Float Charge. Interest is payable monthly on the first calendar day of each month. In computing interest on the Obligations, all payments received after 12:00 p.m. Pacific time on any day shall be deemed received on the next Business Day. In addition, so long as any principal or interest with respect to any Advances remains outstanding, Bank shall be entitled to charge Borrower a \"float\" charge in an amount equal to three (3) Business Days interest, at the interest rate applicable to the Advances, on all payments received by Bank with respect to the Advances (except for payments made directly by Borrower to Bank from Borrower's unrestricted cash on deposit in any deposit account or securities account of Borrower with Bank). The float charge for each month shall be payable on the first day of the month. Bank shall not, however, be required to credit Borrower's account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Bank in its good faith business judgment, and Bank may charge Borrower's Designated Deposit Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to Bank unpaid.\n\n2.4 Fees. Borrower shall pay to Bank:\n\n(a) Termination Fee. Subject to the terms of Section 4.1, a termination fee;\n\n(b) Letter of Credit Fee. Bank's customary fees and expenses for the issuance or renewal of Letters of Credit, upon the issuance or renewal of such Letter of Credit by Bank;\n\n(c) Collateral Monitoring Fee. A monthly collateral monitoring fee of $1,500.00, payable in arrears on the first day of each month (prorated for any partial month) and upon termination of this Agreement; and\n\n(d) Bank Expenses. All Bank Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable expenses, plus expenses, for documentation and negotiation of this Agreement) incurred through and after the Effective Date, when due.\n\n3 CONDITIONS OF LOANS\n\n3.1 Conditions Precedent to Initial Credit Extension. Bank's obligation to make the initial Credit Extension is subject to the condition precedent that Bank shall have received, in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, such documents, and completion of such other matters, as Bank may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation:\n\n(a) Borrower shall have delivered duly executed original signatures to the Loan Documents to which it is a party;\n\n-3-\n\n(b) Borrower shall have delivered duly executed original signatures to the Control Agreements;\n\n(c) Borrower shall have delivered (i) Operating Documents of Borrower and any Guarantor, and (ii) good standing certificates for Borrower and any Guarantor, certified by the Secretary of State of the state of organization for such entity (and from any other jurisdictions as Bank may reasonably request), in each instance as of a date no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date;\n\n(d) Borrower shall have delivered duly executed original signatures to the completed Borrowing Resolutions for Borrower;\n\n(e) Bank shall have received certified copies, dated as of a recent date, of financing statement searches, as Bank shall request, accompanied by written evidence (including any UCC termination statements) that the Liens indicated in any such financing statements either constitute Permitted Liens or have been or, in connection with the initial Credit Extension, will be terminated or released;\n\n(f) Borrower shall have delivered an executed Perfection Certificate for each of Borrower, any Guarantor, and Centra;\n\n(g) Borrower shall have delivered the duly executed original signatures to the Guaranties required by Bank, together with the completed Borrowing Resolutions for each Guarantor;\n\n(h) Borrower shall have delivered evidence satisfactory to Bank that the insurance policies required by both Section 6.7 hereof and the Guaranties are in full force and effect, together with appropriate evidence showing loss payable and/or additional insured clauses or endorsements in favor of Bank;\n\n(i) Borrower shall have paid the fees and Bank Expenses then due as specified in Section 2.4 hereof;\n\n(j) Bank shall have received a field exam report of the Collateral, which includes an audit of the proposed Centra Acquisition;\n\n(k) the Wells Fargo Lockbox Agreement;\n\n(l) certificates representing the shares of capital stock or membership interests (as applicable) of each of Storm Holding Corporation, and Spruce, together with stock powers executed in blank;\n\n(m) copies of executed merger agreements relating to the Centra Acquisition; and\n\n(n) completion of the Centra Acquisition.\n\n3.2 Conditions Precedent to all Credit Extensions. Bank's obligations to make each Credit Extension, including the initial Credit Extension, is subject to the following:\n\n(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4(a), timely receipt of an executed Payment/Advance Form;\n\n(b) the representations and warranties in Section 5 shall be true in all material respects on the date of the Payment/Advance Form and on the Funding Date of each Credit Extension; provided, however, that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof; and provided, further that those representations and warranties expressly referring to a specific date shall be true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of such date, and no\n\n-4-\n\nDefault or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or result from the Credit Extension. Each Credit Extension is Borrower's representation and warranty on that date that the representations and warranties in Section 5 remain true in all material respects; provided, however, that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof; and provided, further that those representations and warranties expressly referring to a specific date shall be true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of such date; and\n\n(c) in Bank's sole discretion, there has not been a Material Adverse Change.\n\n3.3 Covenant to Deliver.\n\nBorrower agrees to deliver to Bank each item required to be delivered to Bank under this Agreement as a condition to any Credit Extension. Borrower expressly agrees that the extension of a Credit Extension prior to the receipt by Bank of any such item shall not constitute a waiver by Bank of Borrower's obligation to deliver such item, and any such extension in the absence of a required item shall be in Bank's sole discretion.\n\n3.4 Procedures for Borrowing. Subject to the prior satisfaction of all other applicable conditions to the making of an Advance set forth in this Agreement, to obtain an Advance (other than Advances under Sections 2.1.2 or 2.1.4), Borrower shall notify Bank (which notice shall be irrevocable) by electronic mail, facsimile, or telephone by 12:00 p.m. Pacific time on the Funding Date of the Advance. Together with such notification, Borrower must promptly deliver to Bank by electronic mail or facsimile a Transaction Report. Bank shall credit Advances to the Designated Deposit Account. Bank may make Advances under this Agreement based on instructions from a Responsible Officer or his or her designee or without instructions if the Advances are necessary to meet Obligations which have become due. Bank may rely on any telephone notice given by a person whom Bank believes is a Responsible Officer or designee.\n\n4 CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST\n\n4.1 Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby grants Bank, to secure the payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, a continuing security interest in, and pledges to Bank, the Collateral, wherever located, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or arising, and all proceeds and products thereof. Borrower represents, warrants, and covenants that the security interest granted herein is and shall at all times continue to be a first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral (subject only to Permitted Liens that may have superior priority to Bank's Lien under this Agreement). If Borrower shall acquire a commercial tort claim, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank in a writing signed by Borrower of the general details thereof and grant to Bank in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank.\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date by Borrower, effective three (3) Business Days after written notice of termination is given to Bank or if Bank's obligation to fund Credit Extensions terminates pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1.1(b). Notwithstanding any such termination, Bank's lien and security interest in the Collateral shall continue until Borrower fully satisfies its Obligations (other than inchoate Obligations). If such termination is at Borrower's election or at Bank's election due to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall pay to Bank, in addition to the payment of any other expenses or fees then-owing, a termination fee in an amount equal to (i) one percent (1%) of the sum of the Revolving Line and the Term Loan if such termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date; or (ii) one half of one percent (0.50%) of the sum of the Revolving Line and the Term Loan if such termination occurs between the first and second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no termination fee shall be charged unless the credit facility hereunder is refinanced, replaced or repaid in full with funds from a bank or other financial institution other than another division of Silicon Valley Bank. Upon payment in full of the Obligations and at such time as Bank's obligation to make Credit Extensions has terminated, Bank shall release its liens and security interests in the Collateral and all rights therein shall revert to Borrower.\n\n4.2 Authorization to File Financing Statements. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to file financing statements, without notice to Borrower, with all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect or protect Bank's interest or rights hereunder, including a notice that any disposition of the Collateral, by either Borrower or any other Person, shall be deemed to violate the rights of Bank under the Code.\n\n-5-\n\n5 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\nBorrower represents and warrants as follows:\n\n5.1 Due Organization and Authorization. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are duly existing and in good standing in their respective jurisdictions of formation, and are qualified and licensed to do business and are in good standing in any jurisdiction in which the conduct of their business or their ownership of property requires that they be qualified except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower's business. In connection with this Agreement, Borrower has delivered to Bank completed certificates substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F signed by Borrower, Centra, Spruce and each Guarantor (other than Thinq which is covered by the Borrower's Perfection Certificate), respectively, entitled \"Perfection Certificate\". Borrower represents and warrants to Bank that (a) Borrower's exact legal name is that indicated on its Perfection Certificate and on the signature page hereof; (b) Borrower is an organization of the type and is organized in the jurisdiction set forth in its Perfection Certificate; (c) the Borrower's Perfection Certificate accurately sets forth Borrower's organizational identification number or accurately states that Borrower has none; (d) the Borrower's Perfection Certificate accurately sets forth Borrower's place of business, or, if more than one, its chief executive office as well as Borrower's mailing address (if different than its chief executive office); (e) Borrower (and each of its predecessors) has not, in the past five (5) years, changed its state of formation, organizational structure or type, or any organizational number assigned by its jurisdiction; and (f) all other information set forth on the Borrower's Perfection Certificate pertaining to Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is accurate and complete. If Borrower is not now a Registered Organization but later becomes one, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of such occurrence and provide Bank with Borrower's organizational identification number.\n\nThe execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized, and do not conflict with Borrower's organizational documents, nor constitute an event of default under any material agreement by which Borrower is bound. Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound in which the default could have a material adverse effect on Borrower's business.\n\n5.2 Collateral. Borrower has good title to the Collateral, free of Liens except Permitted Liens. Borrower has no deposit accounts other than the deposit accounts with Bank and deposit accounts described in the Perfection Certificate delivered to Bank in connection herewith.\n\nThe Collateral is not in the possession of any third party bailee (such as a warehouse). Except as hereafter disclosed to Bank in writing by Borrower, none of the components of the Collateral shall be maintained at locations other than (a) as provided in the Perfection Certificate, or (b) such locations where not more than $25,000 of Collateral (at any one location) is kept. In the event that Borrower, after the date hereof, intends to store or otherwise deliver any portion of the Collateral to a bailee, then Borrower will first receive the written consent of Bank and such bailee must acknowledge in writing that the bailee is holding such Collateral for the benefit of Bank.\n\nAll Inventory is in all material respects of good and marketable quality, free from material defects.\n\n5.3 Accounts Receivable.\n\n(a) For each Account with respect to which Advances are requested, on the date each Advance is requested and made, such Account shall be an Eligible Account as set forth in Section 13 below.\n\n(b) All statements made and all unpaid balances appearing in all invoices, instruments and other documents evidencing the Accounts are and shall be true and correct in all material respects and all such invoices, instruments and other documents, and all of Borrower's Books are genuine and in all respects what they purport to be. All sales and other transactions underlying or giving rise to each Account shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations. Borrower has no knowledge of any actual or imminent Insolvency Proceeding of any Account Debtor whose accounts are Eligible Accounts in any Transaction Report. To the best of Borrower's knowledge, all signatures and endorsements on all documents, instruments, and agreements relating to all Accounts are genuine, and all such documents, instruments and agreements are legally enforceable in accordance with their terms.\n\n5.4 Litigation. There are no actions or proceedings pending against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries involving more than $500,000, and there are no actions or proceedings, to the knowledge of any of the Borrower's Responsible Officers or its general counsel, threatened in writing by or against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which a likely adverse decision could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.\n\n-6-\n\n5.5 No Material Deviation in Financial Statements. All consolidated financial statements for Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries delivered to Bank fairly present in all material respects Borrower's consolidated financial condition and Borrower's consolidated results of operations. There has not been any material deterioration in Borrower's consolidated financial condition since the date of the most recent financial statements submitted to Bank.\n\n5.6 Solvency. The fair salable value of Borrower's assets (including goodwill minus disposition costs) exceeds the fair value of its liabilities; Borrower is not left with unreasonably small capital after the transactions in this Agreement; and Borrower is able to pay its debts (including trade debts) as they mature.\n\n5.7 Regulatory Compliance. Borrower is not an \"investment company\" or a company \"controlled\" by an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act. Borrower is not engaged as one of its important activities in extending credit for margin stock (under Regulations T and U of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors). Borrower has complied in all material respects with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Borrower has not violated any laws, ordinances or rules, the violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business. None of Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' properties or assets has been used by Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, by previous Persons, in disposing, producing, storing, treating, or transporting any hazardous substance other than legally. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained all consents, approvals and authorizations of, made all declarations or filings with, and given all notices to, all government authorities that are necessary to continue its business as currently conducted, except where failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change.\n\n5.8 Subsidiaries; Investments. Borrower does not own any stock, partnership interest or other equity securities except for Permitted Investments.\n\n5.9 Tax Returns and Payments; Pension Contributions. Borrower has timely filed all required tax returns and reports, and Borrower has timely paid all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower. Borrower may defer payment of any contested taxes, provided that Borrower (a) in good faith contests its obligation to pay the taxes by appropriate proceedings promptly and diligently instituted and conducted, (b) notifies Bank in writing of the commencement of, and any material development in, the proceedings, (c) posts bonds or takes any other steps required to prevent the governmental authority levying such contested taxes from obtaining a Lien upon any of the Collateral that is other than a \"Permitted Lien\". Borrower is unaware of any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower's prior tax years which could result in additional taxes becoming due and payable by Borrower, other than taxes that may become payable in an amount not exceeding $350,000 as a result of a current tax audit in France for which adequate reserves have been established. Borrower has paid all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not withdrawn from participation in (other than with respect to Centra in connection with the Centra Acquisition), and has not permitted partial or complete termination of, or permitted the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any other governmental agency, other than liability of Borrower in an amount not to exceed $350,000 in connection with the Centra Acquisition, for which adequate reserves have been established if so required by GAAP.\n\n5.10 Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Advances solely as (i) working capital, and (ii) to fund its general business requirements, including the Centra Acquisition. The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used to repay in full the Prior Loans (without penalty or premium on such Prior Loans), and any excess of the Term Loan disbursed to Borrower shall be used solely for those purposes set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence. Upon repayment in full of the Prior Loans, the Prior Loan Agreements (other than any UCC financing statements, Control Agreements, or any pledged securities) shall terminate.\n\n5.11 Full Disclosure. No written representation, warranty or other statement of Borrower in any certificate or written statement given to Bank, as of the date such representations, warranties, or other statements were made, taken together with all such written certificates and written statements given to Bank, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained in the certificates or statements not misleading (it being recognized by Bank that the projections and forecasts provided by Borrower in good faith and based upon reasonable assumptions are not viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections and forecasts may differ from the projected or forecasted results).\n\n-7-\n\n6 AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS\n\nBorrower shall do all of the following:\n\n6.1 Government Compliance.\n\n(a) Subject to Section 7.3, maintain its and all its Subsidiaries' legal existence and good standing in their respective jurisdictions of formation and maintain qualification in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower's business or operations. Borrower shall comply, and have each Subsidiary comply, with all laws, ordinances and regulations to which it is subject, noncompliance with which could have a material adverse effect on Borrower's business.\n\n(b) Borrower shall cause within thirty (30) days from the Effective Date its Subsidiaries Thinq and TrainingServer, Inc. to (i) resolve their respective tax liabilities in the State of Maryland (which liabilities shall not exceed $84,000 in the aggregate and for which adequate reserves have been established), and (ii) deliver to Bank good standing certificates for each such entity from the State of Maryland.\n\n(c) Borrower shall deliver to Bank within three (3) days of the Effective Date, a filed-stamped copy of \"Certificate of Merger\" relating to Spruce, filed with and certified by the Delaware Secretary of State, which shall be in substantially the same form as the copy provided to Bank prior to filing, and shall be dated and file-stamped on the Effective Date.\n\n6.2 Financial Statements, Reports, Certificates.\n\n(a) Borrower shall provide Bank with the following:\n\n(i) within twenty (20) days after the end of each month, (A) monthly accounts receivable agings, aged by invoice date, (B) monthly accounts payable agings, aged by invoice date, and outstanding or held check registers, if any, and (C) a Deferred Revenue report;\n\n(ii) as soon as available, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the end of each month, company-prepared, monthly unaudited financial statements;\n\n(iii) within forty-five (45) days after the end of each month a monthly Compliance Certificate signed by a Responsible Officer, certifying that as of the end of such month, Borrower was in full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and setting forth calculations showing compliance with the financial covenants set forth in this Agreement and such other information as Bank shall reasonably request, including, without limitation, a statement that at the end of such month there were no held checks;\n\n(iv) as soon as available s, but no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal year of Borrower, (A) a one (1) year (prepared on a quarterly basis) financial projections of Borrower on a consolidated basis, including a balance sheet and statements of income and cash flows and showing projected operating revenues, expenses and debt service of Borrower on a consolidated basis prepared under GAAP; and (B) budgets, sales projections, operating plans or other financial information used in the preparation of such financial projections reasonably requested by Bank.\n\n(v) as soon as available, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of Borrower's fiscal year, annual financial statements certified by, and with an unqualified opinion of, independent certified public accountants acceptable to Bank; and\n\n(vi) within five (5) days after filing, all reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (other than those reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K (relating to certification) that are otherwise publicly available through the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR system).\n\n(b) Within 5 Business Days after the end of each week, Borrower shall provide Bank with a Transaction Report, unless Borrower has exercised a Monthly Reporting Option (as defined below).\n\n(c) A \"Monthly Reporting Option\" is the option of Borrower to provide Bank with a Transaction Report on a monthly basis, within 20 days after the end of each month, instead of on a weekly basis under Section 6.2(b), which option shall be available automatically to Borrower without notice to Bank if Borrower\n\n-8-\n\n(a) maintains the Minimum Liquidity Amount, and (b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that (i) if the Monthly Reporting Option is in effect and (A) the Minimum Liquidity Amount ceases to exist at any time for a period of five (5) consecutive days or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then such Monthly Reporting Option shall immediately terminate and the reporting requirement for a Transaction Report shall immediately revert back to the previous reporting arrangement under this Agreement without any notice from Bank to Borrower (the \"Reporting Option Termination\"); and (ii) if a Reporting Option Termination arises solely because Borrower failed to maintain the Minimum Liquidity Amount for a period of five (5) consecutive days, then Borrower shall be eligible for another Monthly Reporting Option (as described herein) at such time that Borrower has provided Bank (to Bank's satisfaction) Transaction Reports showing eight (8) consecutive weeks of Borrower maintaining the Minimum Liquidity Amount. Regardless of whether a Monthly Reporting Option is in effect, Borrower shall continue to provide Bank with Transaction Reports in accordance with Section 3.4 hereof.\n\n(d) As soon as practicable, and in no event later than 60 days after the Effective Date, Borrower shall deliver a report showing all purchase accounting Deferred Revenue adjustments made by Borrower in connection with the Centra Acquisition.\n\n6.3 Accounts Receivable.\n\n(a) Schedules and Documents Relating to Accounts. Borrower shall deliver to Bank transaction reports and schedules of collections, as provided in Section 6.2, on Bank's standard forms; provided, however, that Borrower's failure to execute and deliver the same shall not affect or limit Bank's Lien and other rights in all of the Accounts, nor shall Bank's failure to advance or lend against a specific Account affect or limit Bank's Lien and other rights therein. If requested by Bank, Borrower shall furnish Bank with copies (or, at Bank's request, originals) of all contracts, orders, invoices, and other similar documents, and all shipping instructions, delivery receipts, bills of lading, and other evidence of delivery, for any goods the sale or disposition of which gave rise to such Accounts. In addition, Borrower shall deliver to Bank, on its request, the originals of all instruments, chattel paper, security agreements, guarantees and other documents and property evidencing or securing any Accounts, in the same form as received, with all necessary indorsements, and copies of all credit memos.\n\n(b) Disputes. Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of all disputes or claims relating to Accounts that involve more than $150,000. Borrower may forgive (completely or partially), compromise, or settle any Account for less than payment in full, or agree to do any of the foregoing so long as (i) Borrower does so in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner, in the ordinary course of business, in arms-length transactions, and reports the same to Bank in the regular reports provided to Bank; (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (iii) after taking into account all such discounts, settlements and forgiveness, the total outstanding Advances will not exceed the Net Borrowing Availability.\n\n(c) Collection of Accounts. Borrower shall have the right (on its own behalf and on behalf of Spruce, Thinq and any other Affiliate of Borrower as Bank may designate from time to time) to collect all Accounts, unless and until a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall hold all payments on, and proceeds of, Accounts in trust for Bank. Such payments and proceeds shall be applied to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof. Until such further time as Bank directs pursuant to the last sentence hereof, all proceeds of Accounts shall be deposited into the Restricted Revenue Account(s) with Wells Fargo and shall be subject to the Wells Fargo Lockbox Agreement, except that, in the case of Accounts of Spruce, the proceeds of such Accounts are not required to be deposited into the Restricted Revenue Account(s) with Wells Fargo until the six (6) month anniversary of the Effective Date. Subject to the exception in the preceding sentence, Borrower shall (and shall cause Spruce, Thinq and such other Affiliate as Bank may designate from time to time to) direct all customers and Account Debtors of Borrower, Spruce, Thinq and/or any other Affiliate of Borrower as Bank may designate to remit all payments owing to such entities to the Restricted Revenue Account(s) with Wells Fargo and/or such other Restricted Revenue Account(s) as Bank may specify from time to time pursuant to the last sentence hereof. Borrower shall use its best efforts to ensure that all collections of Accounts are paid and delivered into the Restricted Revenue Account(s) with Wells Fargo and/or such other Restricted Revenue Account(s) as Bank may specify from time to time pursuant to the last sentence hereof. If an Event of Default has occurred, Bank may require that all proceeds of Accounts be deposited into a Restricted Revenue Account other than, or in addition to, the Restricted Revenue Account(s) with Wells Fargo pursuant to a Lockbox Agreement in form and substance acceptable to Bank.\n\n(d) Returns. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, if any Account Debtor returns any Inventory to Borrower, Spruce, Thinq, or such other Affiliate of Borrower as Bank may designate from time to time, Borrower shall follow Borrower's customary practices as they exist at the execution of\n\n-9-\n\nthis Agreement. Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of all returns and recoveries that involve more than $500,000. In the event any attempted return occurs after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower shall hold the returned Inventory in trust for Bank, and immediately notify Bank of the return of the Inventory.\n\n(e) Verification. Bank may, from time to time, verify directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other matters relating to the Accounts, either in the name of Borrower, Spruce, Thinq, any other Affiliate of Borrower as Bank may designate from time to time or Bank or such other name as Bank may choose.\n\n(f) No Liability. Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage or discrepancy in, damage to, or loss or destruction of, any goods, the sale or other disposition of which gives rise to an Account, or for any error, act, omission, or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, failure to settle, collection or failure to collect any Account, or for settling any Account in good faith for less than the full amount thereof, nor shall Bank be deemed to be responsible for any of Borrower's obligations under any contract or agreement giving rise to an Account. Nothing herein shall, however, relieve Bank from liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n6.4 Remittance of Proceeds. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.3(c), 6.7 and 9.4, deliver, in kind, all proceeds arising from the disposition of any Collateral to Bank in the original form in which received by Borrower not later than the following Business Day after receipt by Borrower, to be applied to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof; provided that, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be obligated to remit to Bank the proceeds of the sale of Equipment disposed of by Borrower in good faith in an arm's length transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000 or less (for all such transactions in any fiscal year). Borrower agrees that it will not commingle proceeds of Collateral with any of Borrower's other funds or property, but will hold such proceeds separate and apart from such other funds and property and in an express trust for Bank. Nothing in this Section limits the restrictions on disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\n6.5 Taxes; Pensions. Timely file all required tax returns and reports and timely pay all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower except for deferred payment of any taxes contested pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9 hereof, and pay all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, except as permitted by Section 5.9 with respect to Borrower's liability in an amount not to exceed $350,000 in connection with the Centra Acquisition, for which adequate reserves have been established if so required by GAAP.\n\n6.6 Access to Collateral; Books and Records.\n\n(a) At reasonable times, on one (1) Business Day's notice (provided no notice is required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), Bank, or its agents, shall have the right to inspect the Collateral and the right to audit and copy Borrower's Books, subject to Bank's confidentiality obligations in Section 12.9. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Borrower's expense, and the charge therefor shall be $750 per person per day (or such higher amount as shall represent Bank's then-current standard charge for the same), plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (collectively, the \"Borrower Audit Fees\"). Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then (i) such audits and inspections by Bank shall be performed only on a semi-annual basis, and (ii) the Borrower Audit Fees, together with any and all Guarantor Audit Fees, shall be limited in the aggregate amount of no more than $15,000 per annum.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Borrower and Bank schedule an audit more than five (5) days in advance, and Borrower cancels or seeks to reschedules the audit with less than five (5) days written notice to Bank, then (without limiting any of Bank's rights or remedies), Borrower shall pay Bank a fee of $1,000 plus any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Bank to compensate Bank for the anticipated costs and expenses of the cancellation or rescheduling.\n\n6.7 Insurance. Keep its business and the Collateral insured for risks and in amounts standard for companies in Borrower's industry and location and as Bank may reasonably request. Insurance policies shall be with financially sound and reputable insurance companies. All property policies shall have a lender's loss payable endorsement showing Bank as an additional loss payee and waive subrogation against Bank, and all liability policies shall show, or have endorsements showing, Bank as an additional insured. All policies (or the loss payable and\n\n-10-\n\nadditional insured endorsements) shall provide that the insurer must give Bank at least thirty (30) days notice (or ten (10) days notice in the case of cancellation for non-payment of premium) before canceling, materially amending, or declining to renew its policy. At Bank's request, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of policies and evidence of all premium payments. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall have the option of applying the proceeds of any casualty policy to the replacement or repair of destroyed or damaged property; provided, that, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, proceeds payable under any policy shall, at Bank's option, be payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. If Borrower fails to obtain insurance as required under this Section 6.7 or to pay any amount or furnish any required proof of payment to third persons and Bank, Bank may make all or part of such payment or obtain such insurance policies required in this Section 6.7, and take any action under the policies Bank deems prudent.\n\n6.8 Operating Accounts.\n\n(a) Until the Revolving Line Maturity Date, Borrower will maintain an amount of not less than $6,000,000 of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents in a deposit account and/or money market account with Bank or a Bank Affiliate. If Borrower fails to comply with the terms of this Section 6.8(a) at any time, Borrower shall pay to Bank within three (3) days after the initial date such non-compliance occurs, a one-time, non-refundable fee equal to the amount set forth below for the period such non-compliance occurs (the \"Deposit Fee\"); provided, however, once Borrower pays the Deposit Fee, Bank shall not require Borrower to pay another such Deposit Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, so long as Borrower pays the Deposit Fee as and when due, Borrower's failure to maintain an amount of not less than $6,000,000 of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents in a deposit account and/or money market account with Bank or a Bank Affiliate shall not be deemed an Event of Default hereunder or a breach of this Section 6.8(a).\n\n(b) Maintain its and its Subsidiaries' depository, operating and securities accounts with Bank and Bank's Affiliates, which exist with Bank and Bank's Affiliates on the Effective Date.\n\n(c) Provide Bank five (5) days prior written notice before Borrower, Spruce, Thinq or such other Affiliate of Borrower as Bank may designate from time to time establishes any Collateral Account at or with any bank or financial institution other than Bank or its Affiliates. In addition, for each Collateral Account that Borrower, or such other Person mentioned in the preceding sentence, at any time maintains, Borrower shall cause the applicable bank or financial institution (other than Bank) at or with which any such Collateral Account is maintained to execute and deliver a Control Agreement or other appropriate instrument with respect to such Collateral Account to perfect Bank's Lien in such Collateral Account in accordance with the terms hereunder. The provisions of this Section 6.8(c) shall not apply to deposit accounts exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes and other employee wage and benefit payments to or for the benefit of Borrower's employees and identified to Bank by Borrower as such.\n\n6.9 Financial Covenants.\n\nBorrower shall maintain, to be tested as of the last day of each month, unless otherwise noted, on a consolidated basis with respect to Borrower and its Subsidiaries:\n\n(a) Liquidity.

Borrower shall promptly advise Bank in writing of material infringements of its or any of its Subsidiary's intellectual property known by its Responsible Officers or its general counsel;\n\n6.11 Litigation Cooperation. From the date hereof and continuing through the termination of this Agreement, make available to Bank, without expense to Bank, Borrower and its officers, employees and agents and Borrower's books and records, to the extent that Bank may deem them reasonably necessary to prosecute or defend any third-party suit or proceeding instituted by or against Bank with respect to any Collateral or relating to Borrower.\n\n6.12 Further Assurances. Borrower shall execute any further instruments and take further action as Bank reasonably requests to perfect or continue Bank's Lien in the Collateral or to effect the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n7 NEGATIVE COVENANTS\n\nBorrower shall not do any of the following without Bank's prior written consent:\n\n7.1 Dispositions.

Borrower grants Bank a license to enter and occupy any of its premises, without charge, to exercise any of Bank's rights or remedies;\n\n(g) apply to the Obligations any (i) balances and deposits of Borrower it holds, or (ii) any amount held by Bank owing to or for the credit or the account of Borrower;\n\n(h) ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell the Collateral. Bank is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower's labels, patents, copyrights, mask works, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter, or any similar property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Bank's exercise of its rights under this Section, Borrower's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements inure to Bank's benefit;\n\n(i) place a \"hold\" on any account maintained with Bank and/or deliver a notice of exclusive control, any entitlement order, or other directions or instructions pursuant to any Control Agreement or similar agreements providing control of any Collateral;\n\n(j) demand and receive possession of Borrower's Books; and\n\n-15-\n\n(k) exercise all rights and remedies available to Bank under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code (including disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof).\n\n9.2 Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact, exercisable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to: (a) endorse Borrower's name on any checks or other forms of payment or security; (b) sign Borrower's name on any invoice or bill of lading for any Account or drafts against Account Debtors; (c) settle and adjust disputes and claims about the Accounts directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and on terms Bank determines reasonable; (d) make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrower's insurance policies; (e) pay, contest or settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance, security interest, and adverse claim in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; and (f) transfer the Collateral into the name of Bank or a third party as the Code permits. Borrower hereby appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact to sign Borrower's name on any documents necessary to perfect or continue the perfection of any security interest regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred until all Obligations have been satisfied in full and Bank is under no further obligation to make Credit Extensions hereunder. Bank's foregoing appointment as Borrower's attorney in fact, and all of Bank's rights and powers, coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations have been fully repaid and performed and Bank's obligation to provide Credit Extensions terminates.\n\n9.3 Protective Payments. If Borrower fails to obtain the insurance called for by Section 6.7 or fails to pay any premium thereon or fails to pay any other amount which Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Bank may obtain such insurance or make such payment, and all amounts so paid by Bank are Bank Expenses and immediately due and payable, bearing interest at the then highest applicable rate, and secured by the Collateral. Bank will make reasonable efforts to provide Borrower with notice of Bank obtaining such insurance at the time it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter. No payments by Bank are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in the future or Bank's waiver of any Event of Default.\n\n9.4 Application of Payments and Proceeds.\n\n(a) Bank shall collect all funds held in the Restricted Revenue Account(s) on a daily basis in accordance with the Wells Fargo Lockbox Agreement and/or such other Lockbox Agreements then in effect (the \"Lockbox Sweep\"), and shall apply such funds in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 9.4 and Section 2.3, unless a Static Balance Option (as defined below) is in effect.\n\n(b) A \"Static Balance Option\" is the option of Borrower to have Bank suspend the Lockbox Sweep, which option shall be available only when the Monthly Reporting Option is available and in effect. If a Static Balance Option is in effect, then Bank shall suspend the Lockbox Sweep in accordance with the terms of the Lockbox Agreements, and Borrower shall have access to such Restricted Revenue Accounts.\n\n(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (a) above, Bank shall apply any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, or proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Accounts or other disposition of the Collateral, first, to the principal of the Term Loan then due and the Advances; second, to Bank Expenses, including without limitation, the reasonable costs, expenses, liabilities, obligations and attorneys' fees incurred by Bank in the exercise of its rights under this Agreement; third, to the interest due upon any of the Obligations; and finally, to any applicable fees and other charges then due, in such order as Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency.\n\n(d) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Bank may apply any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Accounts or other disposition of the Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations in such order as Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or to other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency. If Bank, in its good faith business judgment, directly or indirectly enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Bank shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Bank of cash therefor\n\n-16-\n\n9.5 Bank's Liability for Collateral. So long as Bank complies with reasonable banking practices regarding the safekeeping of the Collateral in the possession or under the control of Bank, Bank shall not be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c) any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person. Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral.\n\n9.6 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. Bank's failure, at any time or times, to require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Bank thereafter to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by Bank and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is given. Bank's rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Bank has all rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. Bank's exercise of one right or remedy is not an election, and Bank's waiver of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Bank's delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence.\n\n9.7 Demand Waiver. Except for sections in this Agreement that expressly provide for notice to Borrower, Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees held by Bank on which Borrower is liable.\n\n10 NOTICES\n\nAll notices, consents, requests, approvals, demands, or other communication (collectively, \"Communication\"), other than Advance requests made pursuant to Section 3.4, by any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document must be in writing and be delivered or sent by facsimile at the addresses or facsimile numbers listed below.

Bank has the right, without the consent of Borrower, to sell, transfer, negotiate, or grant participation in all or any part of, or any interest in, Bank's obligations, rights, and benefits under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that Bank shall notify Borrower promptly after any such sale, transfer or grant of participations.\n\n12.2 Indemnification.

All covenants, representations and warranties made in this Agreement continue in full force until this Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms and all Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations and any other obligations which, by their terms, are to survive the termination of this Agreement) have been satisfied. The obligation of Borrower in Section 12.2 to indemnify Bank shall survive until the statute of limitations with respect to such claim or cause of action shall have run.\n\n12.9 Confidentiality. In handling any confidential information, Bank shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises for its own proprietary information, but disclosure of information may be made: (a) to Bank's Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (b) to prospective transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Credit Extensions (provided, however, Bank shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such prospective transferee's or purchaser's agreement to the terms of this provision); (c) as required by law, regulation, subpoena, or other order; (d) to Bank's regulators or as otherwise required in connection with Bank's examination or audit; and (e) as Bank considers appropriate in exercising remedies under this Agreement.
