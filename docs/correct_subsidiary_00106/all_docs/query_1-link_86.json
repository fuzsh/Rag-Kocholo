        "text": "Methodological approaches and efforts towards attainment of excellence in higher education, as the most powerful instrument for social and economic advancement, are undergoing major changes technologically and otherwise. For the university to play a leading role in the ever-changing world of globalization, internationalization, and digitalization; the university curriculum must necessarily be adapted to suit the Revolutionary Information Age that we live in. Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are used all over Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Oceania, and most countries in Africa for the purpose. The need to acquire, know, understand, and actually use LMS in the Third World countries as in the Developed World has arisen and is rapidly increasing aggressively in today's ever-changing globalized digital knowledge economy. Unfortunately however, LMS is not yet in use in any of the universities in Nigeria as a function of lack of information about how LMSs are being used, where and how to acquire LMSs, and which LMSs are the most adopted elsewhere in the world. This research aimed at, and provided the requisite information for universities to easily acquire, develop and use LMSs for effective delivery of higher education to meet the internationalization and globalization needs of the Revolutionary Information Age.\n\nMany Universities recognize the necessity of using Learning Management Systems (LMSs) to increase learners' motivation, encourage interaction, provide feedback and provide support during the learning process. There are many proprietary and open source LMSs that can be found as alternative products. With the ever-growing number of LMSs, the task of developing and evaluating LMS becomes even more important. This paper discusses the factors that affect the use of LMS, the developing issues that have an impact on LMS and the evaluation processes that should be taken to select the suitable LMS. Also, it presents challenges that face LMS success, efficiency, assessment, evaluation, selection and usability. Last it shows the current trends to answer a question of how the LMS of the future will look like.\n\nABSTRACT The main objective of this study was to identify strategies of enabling learners in developing countries to fully exploit the potential of learning management systems (LMSs). The study set out to: (i) identify the services of learning management systems that are most needed and desired by university learners in developing countries, and (ii) to identify appropriate access strategies that would guide design decisions on how to effectively and satisfactorily deliver such services to the university students in developing countries."
