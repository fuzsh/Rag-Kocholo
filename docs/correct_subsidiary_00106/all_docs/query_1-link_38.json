Computer Vision Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Computer Voice Computer voice is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for synthesis and recognition of human voice, including to create virtual assistants (software agents that can perform tasks or services for an individual) like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, and others. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.
