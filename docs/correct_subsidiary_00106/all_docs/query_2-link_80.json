LCMS –Content creation, storage and organisation Collaboration Tools –Contact between learners and tutors Development/Authoring Tools –Specialised tools for producing e-learning content\n\n9 www.feenix.co.uk Content Providers Off the shelf\n\n10 www.feenix.co.uk Courseware 2 Bespoke –External –1 hour of content could cost £20k depending on the interactivity and richness of the media Video Audio Games\n\n11 www.feenix.co.uk Courseware 3 Creating bespoke content internally –Content creation team: SME (subject matter expert) Instructional Designer Graphics designer Programmer –Authoring Tools Macromedia: Flash, Authorware, Coursebuilder (dreamweaver); Toolbook II Lectora publisher, Trainer soft MM Breeze, Robopresenter, Impatica\n\n12 www.feenix.co.uk Highly generalised LMS\n\n13 www.feenix.co.uk LMS’s LMS focused HR Focused\n\n14 www.feenix.co.uk Conceptual E-learning Components The Learning Object (LO) –Smallest chunk of content to stand alone as a meaningful unit –Size is determined by the authors E.g. differences between Netg and Knowledgepool –In standards terms –smallest trackable unit E.g. one ‘assessment’ per LO –Re-useable is key smaller and focused 20 minute maximum\n\n15 www.feenix.co.uk Demo of LMS plus content Students and Local administrators WBT Manager Database WBT Manager Web Module Database Server Web Server ODBC Training ManagerHTTP\n\n16 www.feenix.co.uk General Demo Log-on Home page Launch a lesson Complete some learning View the reports\n\n17 http://www.feenix.co.uk E-Learning Standards History Why the standards are necessary\n\n18 www.feenix.co.uk Where when and who? Early 1980’s Aviation industry was the first to adopt CBT on a large scale –Sophisticated aircraft –Keeping personnel up-to-date –Safety –Records Why CBT? –Media –rich, interactive v printed manual –Additional assessment and data tracking –24/7 availability –Just in time access to most up to date info Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell-Douglas …. –Proprietary hardware and software –High cost, records on multiple computers\n\n19 www.feenix.co.uk History continued 1988 Aviation Industry CBT Committee (AICC) was formed –International group – manufacturers, trainers (military, commercial and civilian) government and regulatory, e-learning vendors and courseware developers –Hardware was ‘sorted’ first –1993 – guideline for computer managed instruction interoperability –1998 – web-based version 1991 – Gulf War –After war – US congress studies concluded that reserve forces needed improved access to education and training –Funds went to National Guard for prototype e-learning classrooms and networks 1997 – Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative (ADL) –US Department of Defence Expanded this work and founded ADL –Publishing first specification of SCORM in 1999 Other standards bodies were IMS and IEEE\n\n20 www.feenix.co.uk Why Do We Need Standards? “..must be a common way –to start content, –for content to communicate with an LMS and –predefined data elements that are exchanged between an LMS and content during its execution.” SCORM overview So that: –Mix and match content from multiple sources in-house off-the-shelf –Re-use content –Avoid proprietary systems –Future-proof e-learning investment\n\n21 http://www.feenix.co.uk Definitions Which Standards Who is certified/compliant\n\n22 www.feenix.co.uk Which Standards? AICC CMI Specification (AGR 010) –www.aicc.orgwww.aicc.org –The Aviation Industry CBT Committee (AICC) has developed a specification that allows courseware from multiple vendors to communicate with a single LMS. The AICC specification has been widely adopted outside the airline industry. ADL SCORM –www.adlnet.org –More recently the Advanced Distributed Learning initiative (ADL) has developed the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification to open e-learning standards to a wider audience. Much of SCORM is based on AICC but some components have been implemented differently.\n\n23 www.feenix.co.uk E-Learning Standards Evolution\n\n24 www.feenix.co.uk Standards Certification AICC CMI Specification –Certification –self-test –Designed to the guidelines ADL SCORM –certification –self-test\n\n25 www.feenix.co.uk Products that can be AICC-Certified LMS LMS - Application Service Provider (ASP) Assignable Unit (Lesson/LO) WBT Courses - Collection of Learning Objects within an AICC/LMS course structure Courseware generation and assessment tools Authoring Systems/Tools\n\n26 www.feenix.co.uk Who is AICC Certified?(14) WBT Manager* TopClass Docent Saba3 Pathlore LMS THINQ ConXerto Achieve (Hk) DIDA GROUP S.p.A (Italian) Getronics S.p.A.

Media – video, graphics sound AICC – Course – Instructional Block – Assignable Unit (AU) - Lesson AICC’s LO Set of named hierarchical learning levels\n\n35 www.feenix.co.uk AICC/SCORM in Short What’s the difference? AICC – CMI Specification Two communication methods HACP ( HTTP-based AICC CMI Protocol) JavaScript API (application programming interface) Has had certification testing for LMS/content/tools since 1999 Doesn’t specify meta-data to describe LOs or course structures SCORM 1.2 JavaScript API only Certification has only been available since 2003 Meta-data specification for LOs (optional) Meta-data specification for content packaging\n\n36 www.feenix.co.uk SCORM\n\n37 www.feenix.co.uk Descriptive Wrapper\n\n38 www.feenix.co.uk API & HACP\n\n39 www.feenix.co.uk Pros Cons & Gotchas CharacteristicsAPIHACP Standards compliance AICC, SCORM AICC Certification available Yes, only just Yes Track RecordShorterLonger RobustnessGoodBetter Potential for growthMoreLess Likelihood of significant changes to spec.MoreLess Implementation base (LMS and courseware)NarrowerBroader Easy to use for courseware developmentYesNo Potential problems with firewalls and browsersYesNo Works with content on any serverNOYes Fully compatible with HTML and JavaScript lessonYesNo\n\n40 www.feenix.co.uk Firewall and security problems A significant number of LMS vendors implement the API as a Java applet that runs on the student browser. Java applets tend to be seen as a security risk and many firewalls block them entirely, some IT departments configure the browsers to disable support for Java. HACP does not have this problem.\n\n41 www.feenix.co.uk Works with any content server? The “gotcha” for the API is the result of a built in security feature with Internet Explorer (IE). If: – your learning content is not in the same domain as your LMS some content providers suggest that the content stay on their own severs and your organisation’s LMS is just pointed to it –the content uses API –the student is using an IE browser then no communication will take place. Options: –use HACP instead of API –Use Netscape –SCORM development committees have published a document detailing some technical ‘work-arounds’ in Oct 2003\n\n42 www.feenix.co.uk Fully compatible with HTML plus JavaScript content? The HACP “gotcha” is that two way communication is not possible with content created with HTML plus JavaScript because although JavaScript (the programming language built into most Web Browsers) can readily send data to the LMS in the required HACP format, it cannot receive the HACP messages that the LMS returns, so for example ‘booking marking’ it not possible.\n\n43 http://www.feenix.co.uk Standards Data Model Core Optional\n\n44 www.feenix.co.uk Core Data Model Student ID Student name Lesson location Credit Lesson Mode Lesson status Path Score Time The following data is sent to a lesson when it is launched. Similar data is returned to the LMS when the lesson completes. Note: SCORM has a slightly reduced data model overall\n\n45 www.feenix.co.uk Example 1: Student ID Definition: An identifier for the student that is unique within the LMS system. Direction of travel: LMS to lesson only –AICC HACP name: Student_ID –AICC API name: cmi.core.student_id –SCORM API name: cmi.core.student_id\n\n46 www.feenix.co.uk Example 2: Lesson Location Definition: A mechanism for lessons to report the point at which the student exited, primarily to serve as a bookmark. Direction of travel: Lesson to LMS; LMS to lesson –AICC HACP name: Lesson_Location –AICC API name: cmi.core.lesson_location –SCORM API name: cmi.core.lesson_location\n\n47 www.feenix.co.uk Optional Data Model Elements - Grouped Core –Mandatory plus lesson mode (browsing.reviewing) Comments –Brief free-form test comments: LMS can send comments from admin + LO can send comments from the learner Evaluation –Used for evaluation the effectiveness of the LO –not included in the SCORM data set Objectives –Records scores and status info for identified learning objectives Student data –E.g. mastery score, time limit, action if time limit exceeded. –AICC also tracks info about multiple attempts Student demographics –Background info about the learner –Not included in the SCORM data set Student preferences –For presentation of LO, appearance, sound, language etc.\n\n48 www.feenix.co.uk Example 1: Attempt Number Definition: This AICC-only element indicates the number of times a student has previously entered the lesson. The LMS initializes this value to \"0\" the first time the student enters the lesson and increments it on each subsequent entry. The lesson determines how, if at all, this value is used. Direction of travel: Lesson to LMS; LMS to lesson –AICC HACP name: Attempt_Number –AICC API name: cmi.student_data.attempt_number –SCORM API name: not supported\n\n49 www.feenix.co.uk Example 2: Objective Status Definition: The student's current status in the objective. Objectives Status may be set to one of six defined values: Not Attempted, Browsed, Incomplete, Completed, Passed, or Failed. Direction of travel: LMS to lesson; lesson to LMS –AICC HACP name: Objectives_Status.n –AICC API name: cmi.objectives.n.status –SCORM API name: cmi.objectives.n.status\n\n50 www.feenix.co.uk Demo of optional elements Tracking and Reports –Objectives –Interactive –Prerequisites –Completion requirements\n\n51 www.feenix.co.uk Future - SCORM 1.3 The introduction of simple sequencing. –LMSs will sequence learning activities at the time of delivery, based upon learner’s results progress to date behaviours specified externally to the learning content. –Different sequencing behaviour can be applied to the same piece of content when it is used in different contexts. first step to truly individualized and adaptive learning delivery, gives Instructional Designers the same level of sequencing control that was typical in CBT (Computer Based Training). All data elements will be mandatory for implementation by LMSs. –This will simplify the selection of LMSs for purchasers and the development of content that is intended to run in a variety of LMSs.\n\n52 http://www.feenix.co.uk Things you need to know…. LMS Content\n\n53 www.feenix.co.uk LMS To what version is the LMS certified? –N.B certification only available to SCORM 1.2 –Legacy support for SCORM 1.1? What data elements will be tracked by the LMS? –AICC Core Optional –Scorm Core Optional What is the cost of customisation of front end and reporting\n\n54 www.feenix.co.uk Content Vendors What version of SCORM is the content compliant with? What data elements are being tracked currently When is the data being sent? –Exit –What if? Network connection is lost, computer crash, learner forgets to exit and a time-out occurs. –How critical is the data e.g. score sent immediately, time not so critical –Bookmarking? –How many database hits can you afford? – Server capacity\n\n55 www.feenix.co.uk Up to Date Information AICC CMI Subcommittee (Hyde, J., chair) CMI Guidelines for Interoperability –Available at http://www.aicc.orghttp://www.aicc.org Dodds,P., Ed., Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM): The SCORM Run-Time Environment, version 1.2 –Available at http://www.adlnet.orghttp://www.adlnet.org Website to the book –http://www.elearning-standards.com\n\n56 www.feenix.co.uk E-Learning Standards Book E-Learning Standards A Guide to Purchasing, Developing and Deploying E-Learning Standards By Carol Fallon and Sharon Brown St. Lucie Press Published November 15 th 2002"
