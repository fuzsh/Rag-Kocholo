Potgieter brings diverse technology and management experience to OSC, part of Breckenridge Insurance Group, where he will oversee implementation and launch of the next-generation IrisX (Informed Risk eXchange) suite of tracking and compliance solutions for financial services clients nationwide.\n\n“With experience in all aspects of the industry — from technical expertise to project management and leadership — Nico truly understands the complex and evolving regulatory environment in which our clients operate, particularly those operating in the lender-placed insurance sector,” said John Dangoia, executive vice president and chief operating officer of OSC. “Under Nico’s leadership, OSC will continue to deliver the cutting-edge technology resources that have made us a trusted partner of our clients for decades.”\n\nAs senior director of implementation at OSC, Potgieter will oversee the client rollout of the next-generation, cloud-based IrisX software suite, a key piece of the company’s strategic focus on — and increased investment in — its benchmark compliance and multi-collateral tracking products. Potgieter will collaborate with OSC’s industry partners and clients through all stages of the transition to ensure full and seamless integration.\n\nBefore joining OSC, Potgieter, a certified Project Management Professional, was manager of professional services at insurance software provider Vertafore and senior project manager at ImageRight, an insurance content management system.
