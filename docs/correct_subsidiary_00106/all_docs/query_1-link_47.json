        "text": "Trends to Watch\n\nBlended Learning:\n\nWhile instructor-led classroom training is the dominant form of training, blended learning—combining in-classroom training and e-learning reinforcement—is becoming more popular.\n\nCustomers Pick and Choose:\n\nMirus, the investment banking firm, notes in its study that content providers \"are facing uncertain times as buyers move away from the content library model, deciding instead to cherry-pick content from a variety of vendors.\"\n\nPrice Pressure:\n\nYahoo offers a directory of free classes, as well as tools for creating and hosting your own courses. In April, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced its free OpenCourseWare Web resource will host the materials for more than 2,000 classes taught at MIT within 10 years.\n\nExpertise:\n\nDigitalThink's Monica Noordam notes, \"Companies are looking for vendors with expertise in their own industry. Being an e-learning expert isn't enough anymore. You need to be an expert in e-learning and in retail or financial services, as examples.\" Furthermore, classroom content doesn't always translate well to e-learning technologies."
