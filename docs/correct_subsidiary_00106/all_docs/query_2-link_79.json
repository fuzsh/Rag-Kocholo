And it has in an impressive, staggering way during the last five years. Not only has the number of computers and CALL applications increased in academic institutions, but also the computer as a technology has attracted the attention and, relevantly, the money, of individual consumers worldwide, all of them potential learners of foreign languages. Using Cameron’s words (1999b: 1) CALL has turned into ‘‘youthful confidence”. If a technology grows mature when it is visible, now the risk is that computer-related communication and technology may blind the CALL arena so that eventually it becomes mere soil for fruitless innovation, a place for the latest fad in language teaching. However, research and academic attention to CALL has initiated a seamlessly effort to invest the discipline with practices which are commonplace in other areas of Foreign Language Teaching (FLT). Recent scholarly monographs have laid stress on different aspects of CALL. Debski and Levy (eds.) (1999) have advocated a holistic, macro view approach whereas Cameron (ed.) (1999a) has compiled contributions which reflect a concern for learning and integration into mainstream educational institutions. Egbert and Hanson-Smith (ed.) (1999) have attempted to develop a theoretical basis for CALL where the role of the learning environment becomes paramount and Cameron (1999b) have underpinned the need for sound design principles. ^ The vision of CALL advocated in this monograph is, continuing with the analogy above, mature in different ways. Underlying the discussions herein, pedagogy drives technology, rather than the opposite. This definitely places the ball again in the pitch of mainstream FLT. This monograph of IJES starts with a lucid introduction of CALL by Prof Riischoff The papers are divided into four main sections. In the first. State of the Art, Prof Davies and Prof Bangs, discuss central issues which are paramount in CALL by presenting a comprehensive overview of problems such as teacher training and authoring with a focus on the role of teachers in dealing with CALL applications. A second part of the monograph, The Internet and Language Laboratories, offers an account of existing technologies. Dr. Roman, Prof Ruiperez and Dr. Perez-Paredes shows an interest in the role of technology in FLT. A third part of this volume, 9 P.F. Perez-Paredea & P. Cantos-Gomez viii Software, is concerned with different software applications, mainly from a general, overview perspective ranging from programming standards, Dr, Gimeno and Prof. Suss and Dr. Oberhofer, to Natural Language Application Tools, Dr. Cantos, and closing with the latest e- mobile phone standards applicable to CALL by Jose Carlos Cabrero. The last section, Language Learning Applications, is devoted to different CALL experiences, Jesus Soria, Dr. Alcaraz and Dr. Fernandez. All in all, the contributions herein present a comprehensive survey of current trends in Technology-Enhanced Language Learning. We would like to thank the contributors, the readers and very specially Prof Riischoff for the high academic standard of their research and work. REFERENCES Cameron, K. (Ed.). (1999a).

New Technologies and Language Learning Seen in Perspective New technologies have become the predominant influence on the way we live and work at the beginning of the new millennium. Some view the changes effected by global networks and information technologies with some apprehension. Others consider the innovative potential of world wide co-operation via e-mail and internet as well as unprohibited access to information and digital resources by means of telecommunications and other forms of electronic publication to be of benefit for both the professional and the educational world. Our society, which has now become what is best described by the term knowledge society, is undergoing tremendous changes. Such changes are linked with challenges which need to be met not just by business and industry but even more so by educational institutions at all levels. As new technologies are nowadays used as tools in almost all trades, they also need to be exploited as learning tools in order to initiate changes in the way we teach and learn. A principled approach is needed in order to translate the potential of new technologies into new methodological approaches and changing organisational frameworks for the learning and acquisition of any subject. This is true even more for the learning of foreign languages, as language competencies and intercultural skills will more than ever be part of the key qualifications needed to live and work in the knowledge society. The monograph issue of the IJES on New Trends in CALL is an important contribution to the necessary process of reflecting on past expectations, considering more recent developments, and of evaluating the real potential for innovation through new technologies in language learning, and of defining future courses of aetion. As far as language learning methodology in general is concerned, the debate somewhat kicked off by the advent of new technologies has led to the assumption that the traditional skills of information gathering and © Servicio de Piiblicaciones. Universidad dc Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2 ( 1 ), 2002, pp. ix-xv X Bernd Riischoff Storing as well as the mere learning of facts will no longer be sufficient in order to live, work, and learn in the coming centuries. Consequently, the ultimate aim of teaching and learning is now seen as that of assisting learners in their need to develop strategies of knowledge processing. Therefore, quite a number of colleagues in the field accept the need to replace the traditional transmission model of learning with models which emphasise information processing and knowledge construction as acts of learning most suited for the acquisition of the kind of skills needed for the knowledge society. Education and teaching in the knowledge society can no longer be reduced to '\"'‘the act, process, or art of imparting knowledge andskiir as Roget’s Thesaurus proposes, but learning must be recognised as an act in which a learner plays the role of an active constructor of knowledge. Criteria based on such principles need to be considered when evaluating the effectiveness and value of technology enhanced materials for language learning. However, as some of the papers in the current monograph issue indicate, very often new technologies have not been able to live up to this kind of expectation, as many of the innovative and flexible learning opportunities offered by ICT have not yet been fully exploited. This is not only due to the fact that a large number of the software produced for CALL is still predominantly of the more traditional learnware type rather than the learning tool kind needed for real change. As Graham Davies points out, this is also due to a lack of teacher training. However, the example presented in his paper, i.e. the 1CT4LT website consisting of technology related training materials for language teachers very much reflects one of the more recent effects of new technologies. This trend concerns more flexible and action research based approaches to teacher training. Very much stimulated by the fact that new technologies have led to a demand for more and better ways of teacher training, current principles of teacher training place an emphasis on a process-oriented approach where teachers are encouraged to continuously reflect and improve on their teaching practices. Such an on-going process may involve taking part in in-service training courses, carrying out action research in classrooms or engaging in collaborative discussions and projects with other teachers in both virtual and face-to-face environments. These activities reflect an altitude that on-going teacher development is a vital part of a good professional’s life and that such development clearly marks the difference between teachers “...with twenty years’ experience and those with one year’s experience repeated twenty times (Ur, 1996:3 17)”. With regard to this, distance courses and training opportunities, such as those offered by Johnson et. al. (2001) as well as the ICT4LT website, offer virtual components which allow teachers to benefit from the tutoring and interaction of an in-service course without it being necessary to travel long distances. Apart from in-service training, teachers have been encouraged to adopt more reflective and critical approaches to their work by the introduction of action research procedures. In action research teachers reflect on a certain aspect of their teaching by collecting data from their classroom — either by keeping a journal, recording classes, distributing questionnaires or interviewing students — and then, based on the results of this research, make decisions about how their future teaching practices should be adapted (Van Lier, 1996; Wallace, 1998), This is © Servicio dc Publicadones. Uiiivcrsidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. ix-xv Inlrucluciiun XI where some of the more recent European projects — apart from the ICT4LT project one should perhaps mention the GEH-MIT project as well as the TALLENT initiative — fit in perfectly with current lines of though in teacher training, as such project plans to structure its curricula as to develop the teachers’ abilities to use computers in everyday teaching, and to design and evaluate didactic plans that make use of the computer as a tool in actual classroom environments”. The planned integration of an action research oriented approach also becomes evident from the fact that “teachers will be asked to introduce a selected sample to their classrooms according to specific lesson plans and evaluate them. Furthermore teachers will be asked to prepare their lesson plans in different cases”. This tendency for teachers to be more reflective about their approach to teaching has increased the need for greater collaboration and interaction between teachers about their profession and their own personal experiences, and this is certainly one of the trends which will greatly benefit from the possibilities offered by new technologies. Another aspect is, of course, the creation of more flexible learning environments which require equally flexible and well-designed teehiiology enhanced materials for language learning. This is an issue addressed by Paul Bangs, Esperanza Roman, German Ruiperez and Pascual Perez-Paredes in their papers. While Perez-Paredes considers the lessons to be learnt from that technology enhanced learning environment of the very first generation, i.e. the language laboratory. Bangs , Roman and Ruiperez discuss web-based learning opportunities and the kind of authoring tools which allow individual teachers as well as institutions to create sound learning materials. It is, however, extremely important to exploit such tools in a way which results in more than mere remedial exercises dealing with grammar or vocabulary. After all, research into the processes of language learning and acquisition suggests that mere training in structural (grammatical) and vocabulary knowledge will not result in real linguistic competence and language proficiency. However, apart from basic communicative competences as well as linguistic competences and skills in the traditional sense often favoured in the communicative classroom of the 80s, strategies of language processing and learning competence as well as language awareness are regarded as an essential part of the overall aims of any language curriculum. This is why both pedagogical principles and instructional or, as I would prefer to label it, exploratory designs need to be considered very carefully. Such principles of software design and software implementation are being discussed in greater detail in Ana Gimeno Sanz’s contribution to the present monograph issue. How do CALL software and other technology enhanced learning tools then fit into the more recent ideas put forward with regard to the basic principles of a (possibly technology enhanced) learning environment? As far as the integration into the actual (real) classroom rather that the virtual learning environment is concerned, Jesus Soria proposes an article which “attempts to define the intimate relationship that is intended between classroom-based and laboratory-based activities, between private study and language class, between individual and collective effort, and between computer-centred and teacher-led learning”. As one of the briefs © Scrvicio de Publicacioncs. Universidad dc Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. ix-xv DerncJ Riischoff xii when asked to contribute an introductory text to this issue was to comment on new trends in the field, this seems to be the appropriate part of the text to put forward a few ideas as to how (at least in metaphorical terms) the flexible and rich learning environment need for such an approach should be designed. As far as a rich learning environment is concerned, Legutke put forward six metaphors Ibr how a language classroom could best be defined exploited in a more fruitful way. Basically, his metaphors — project room, workshop, training centre, observatory, communication centre, and teaching centre — call for more flexibility both in the arrangement of learning scenarios and in the way teachers organise their classroom, and they also provide points of reference as to where and how technology enhanced tools could be of real benefit for language learning. In short, they could be described as follows: • both project room and workshop represent the concept that process-based and product- oriented activities are an integral part of language learning. This means that task-based projects with a clear focus on knowledge construction and a presentable outcome (product) need to become part of language classroom activities more than in the past; • learning, practice, and revision based on innovative materials and interactive tutorials are very important to successful learning processes. This is the basic background of the training centre metaphor. Consequently, classroom management and lesson planning need to consider successful ways of providing learners with meaningful tasks; • the observatory metaphors addresses the need for more authenticity both in task and content in language learning. Learners need to be given the opportunity to get more exposure to real-life language use, and tasks need to be defined which enable learner to interact with authentic language and reflect on authentic contexts of the use of the target language in ways meaningful and supportive to heir learning; • communication and activities stimulating communicative activities in the language classroom are of vital importance. This fact is acknowledged by the communication centre metaphor. As far as new technologies are concerned, telecommunications now offer an opportunity to place learners in a position where they can communicate and exchange views with partners beyond the walls of their classroom; • the teaching centre metaphor emphasises the fact that an integration of tlie different types of activities hinted at in this brief definition of a modern language classroom requires a well-defined and well-designed curriculum. This also suggests that the role of both teachers and learners need to be reconsidered. The best way to describe this — apart from citing the usual labels such as the teacher as a moderator & facilitator — might be to stress the need for a kind of learning partnership between teacher and learner based on clearly defined rules and learning scenarios. © Servicio dc Publicacioncs. Universidad dc Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2 ( 1 ), 2002, pp, ix-xv Imrotluviion xni [t is obviously beyond the scope of this introductory text to provide ICT-based examples for all of the above metaphors, but let me briefly relate the remaining papers of the present monograph to them. It is evident that the internet as well as virtual learning environments in general are of extreme importance in this context. This aspect, particularly the design of distributed learning environments, is discussed in more technical terms in Kurt Siiss and Thomas Oberdorfer’s paper. When considering the observatory metaphor as well as the project room and workshop idea presented above, natural language processing tools and data-driven learning play an important role. This aspect is discussed in Pascal Cantos-Gomez paper. Project-based and observation- oriented learning scenarios are very much part of data-driven learning, where learners are, for example, encouraged to research “a word by the company it keeps” (Firth, 1 957). When it comes to finding innovative examples of the use of new technologies in language learning, any tool that allows for the creation of discovery-based and exploratory, observation-oriented learning materials must rank very highly within a typology of TELL software. One such tool is concordancing software, originally developed as a device to assist research in corpus linguistics. Concordances used to compile context lists and to offer additional insight into the meaning of words, to experience the company words keep, and to gain full insight into difficult structures are one way of opening an observatory. Grammatical rules can be acquired in such a discovery- based or exploratory mode, e.g. on the basis of lists with concordances of adverbs, offering learners the opportunity to discover rather than to be taught a rule concerning adverbs and word order in English sentences. Tim Johns provides a complete website with samples and links on data-driven learning. In addition, Chris Tribble (1997) has published an interesting manual on Using Concordances in ihe Classroom. Similarly, the exploitation of printed and electronic documents and other authentic materials in language learning fits into the observatory and project-room/workshop metaphors referred to above, but is of equal value to most of the other aspects of a technology-enriched learning environment. This aspect is addressed in Piedad Fernandez Toledo’s paper. The creative implementation of a teaching and training centre is exemplified by Alejandro Alcaraz Sintas’s paper on Computer Assisted Instruction of Old English. Finally, Jose Carlos Cabrero points at the ultimate (e-)mobile phone technology within the present foreign language teaching paradigm, presenting an actual application of the latest standards in the field. To finish these introductory remarks, let us return to the tremendous changes initiated by the new technologies which most certainly necessitate a re-thinking of the way we teach and learn languages. The needs of effective language learning cannot be met by courses and software which mainly follow a traditional, behaviourist and instructional methodology. Therefore, it was argued that a constructivist paradigm for learning, focussing on learning in terms of knowledge construction rather than knowledge transmission is better suited for a kind of language learning that leads to the development not only of communicative and structural skills but which also © Servicio de Piiblicacioncs. Uiiiversidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. /7£5, vol. 2 (1), 2002, pp. Ix-xv XIV BernJ Riischoff integrates language awareness and learning competence as equally important aims into its curriculum. In summary, it must be stated that over the past decade, language learning theory has seen a shift from a highly guided to a more open learning environment, with constructivism as a new and very much learner-centred paradigm for learning. Learning is seen as a self-structured and self-motivated process of knowledge construction and the learner is regarded as a self-governed creator of knowledge. In addition to the undeniable need to achieve instructional goals, the development of cognitive and strategic abilities suitable for the knowledge society is defined as one of the principle aims of a learning process based on knowledge construction and discovery learning. As far as new technologies and their use in language learning are concerned, the present monograph issue shows quite impressively that technology enhanced materials do have a lot of potential to assist the process of innovation which is needed in this field. It also shows that a lot of work still lies ahead as far as the successful integration of computer and internet into language learning is concerned. However, in order to ensure the success of future rich efforts, CALL or technology enhanced materials and learning opportunities need to be made use of or designed less in a role as instructional systems and exploited more in a role as tools for teaching and learning, thus giving more credibility to the claim that computers, particularly when used in a role of learning tools, will facilitate the implementation of a methodology for language learning that focuses more than in the past on authenticity in contents, context, and task with the aim of providing language learning opportunities more in tune with the acquisition of competences needed in real-life communication.

UES, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. ix-xv ICT and Modern Foreign Languages: Learning Opportunities and Training Needs Graham Davies* Visiting Professor of CALL, Thames Valley University, London ABSTRACT This article is divided into two main sections. The first section considers why technology has not lived up to its expectations in bringing about improvements in language learning. Many learning opportunities are offered by new technologies but they are not fully exploited, mainly owing to the lack of relevant training offered to teachers. In addition, with the advent of the Web, there is a disturbing trend towards removing the teacher from the learning process — which is simply not acceptable. The second section of the article looks at a website.that offers a considerable volume of ICT training materials for language teachers, namely the ICT4LT website: http://www.ict41t.org. The author examines the aims behind the site as a whole and the pattern of site visits, discussing the key issues and drawing conclusions based on an analysis of the pattern of visits to different modules of the site. Some important lessons have been learned regarding the type of training that teachers appear to need, for example: the continued interest in multimedia and the high demand for introductory courses. It is also evident that Web traffic is predominantly one-way and confined to certain sectors of the world, indicating that much more has to be done in order to stimulate discussion and to make the Web accessible to underserved regions of the world.

THE COMPUTER: PANACEA OR DELUSION? Language teachers have been using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the modern languages classroom for over 20 years. The boom period began in the early 1980s with the advent of the microcomputer, which opened up an exciting new range of learning opportunities for students of languages. The computer was hailed by enthusiasts as the panacea, but after the initial period of euphoria many teachers became disappointed with what the computer appeared to offer. This is a fairly typical sequence of events whenever a new technology becomes available to teachers. Oppenheimer ( 1 997) writes: In 1922 Thomas Edison predicted that ‘the motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks.’ Twenty-three years later, in 1945, William Levenson, the director of the Cleveland public schools’ radio station, claimed that ‘the time may come when a portable radio receiver will be as common in the classroom as is the blackboard.’ Forty years after that the noted psychologist B.F. Skinner, referring to the first days of his ‘teaching machines,* in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote, ‘I was soon saying that, with the help of teaching machines and programmed instruction, students could learn twice as much in the same time and with the same eftbrt as in a standard classroom.’ (Oppenheimer 1997:45) But the situation at the chalkface is another matter: The cycle began with big promises backed by the technology developers’ research. In the classroom, however, teachers never really embraced the new tools, and no significant academic improvement occurred. (Oppenheimer 1997:45) The remainder of Oppenheimer’s article, which is significaintly entitled “The Computer Delusion*’, points out that few lessons have been learned from past mistakes — a view that I have expressed myself in an article entitled “Lessons from the past, lessons for the future” (Davies 1 997). The key question that needs to be asked is: Why do new technologies fail to live up to their expectations? There are a number of factors that Oppenheimer mentions in his article, but one of the main reasons is the failure to allocate a substantial budget for teacher training after the initial purchases of computer hardware and software have been made. This is rather like buying a car without setting aside a budget for driving lessons. It is not the hardware that is at fault, nor the software that runs on it; it is the failure to train teachers to make the best use of the hardware and software. Training, unfortunately, is one of the budget areas that administrators perceive as non- essential, and it is therefore often the subject of financial cuts in times of economic restraint. Continuing the analogy of the driving test, some administrators perceive ICT training as a one-off event: once you have learned to “drive” a computer you don’t need any further training. But computer technology changes so rapidly that constant and regular training is essential — and this is a major cost implication that is all too frequently overlooked. As for the budget, the crucial question is not the size of the budget but how it is divided up. My personal recommendation — © Servicio de Publicadones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.

Above all, training for language teachers has to address their specific needs. A little and often is recommended. II. THE DREAM — OR NIGHTMARE? ICT offers a wealth of learning opportunities for students of languages, and the discrete use of computers in the classroom can undoubtedly enhance a language teacher’s performance, but educational administrators and business training managers often have a blinkered view of computer technology, perceiving it as a way of automating the learning process and saving money on staffing. I wrote the following description of an imaginary scenario as an illustration of how business training managers perceived computer assisted language learning (CALL) in the early 1990s. To some people this is a dream; to others it is a nightmare: A business trainee is sitting at a computer followinga language course. Step-by-step, the computer presents tlie essential vocabulary and structures. These are accompanied, where appropriate, by still and animated graphic images, photographs and video recordings. As new words and phrases are introduced, authentic male and female voices pronounce them and the learner repeats them. The learner’s voice is recorded by the computer and played back. Any errors in pronunciation are indicated graphically on screen. Offending syllables are highlighted and additional practice is offered on sounds which the learner finds difficult. At the end of each presentation sequence, the computer tests the learner’s grasp of the new vocabulary and structures, marking and recording those words and phrases which have been imperfectly recalled and offering feedback on points of grammar that the learner appears to have misunderstood. The learner has access at all times to an online dictionary, a reference grammar and verb conjugation tables. At the end of the work session the learner’s progress is recorded by the computer, which enables the thread to be picked up at the next session. In addition, the learner’s progress records — along with those of all the othertrainees following the same course — can be accessed at any time by the training manager. (Davies 1992: 1 13) Tills fully-automated, programmed-leaming approach was in vogue for a number of years. It derived to a large extent from the dreaded three-phase language lab drills: 1. Stimulus 2. Response 3. Feedback O Servicio de Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. A/£S, vol.2(l), 2002, pp. 1-18 4 Graham Davies The main difference between early computer programs and language lab drills was that response analysis and branching were introduced into the above sequence, thus making it possible for interaction to take place between the learner and machine without the intervention of the teacher. The novelty value of the interaction soon wore off, however, and software designers began to look around for more interesting ways of using the computer. The considerable learning opportunities that computers offer were not fully exploited in the early days. It was therefore easy to dismiss computers as “drill-and-kill” machines. But new ideas were forthcoming. Seminal works by Davies & Higgins (1982, 1985), Higgins & Johns (1 986), Jones & Fortescue (1987), Hardisty & Windeatt (1989) listed a growing variety of CALL programs. Computers could do more than offer automated gap-filling and multiple-choices exercises. The following list is by no means exhaustive: 1 . Reordering exercises — e.g. line and paragraph reordering 2. Text manipulation — including the innovative total deletion exercise 3. Word games 4. Action mazes 5. Simulations 6. Adventures 7. Discovery and exploratory programs 8. Guided writing programs 9. Reading comprehension exercises — including timed reading 10. Listening exercises 1 1 . Building a personal database, e.g. vocabulary, grammar 12. Email activities In addition, there was a move away from the behaviouristic, teacher-independent learning scenario that 1 describe above. As long ago as 1986, Chris Jones wrote an article with a title that says it all: “It’s not so much the program: more what you do with it: the importance of methodology in CALL” (Jones 1 986), Computer programs, he pointed out, have to be integrated into the classroom in just the same way as other materials. His message is clear: Don’t try to remove the teacher from the language learning process. Jones’s advice is just as valid today as it was in the mid-1980s: 1 . Try it and see what happens. Don’t pre-judge. 2. Don’t expect the program to do all the work. 3. If things don’t work out, don’t automatically blame the program. The problem may lie elsewhere. 4. Above all, use your imagination.

THE DREAM REVISITED Warschauer (1996) distinguishes three main phases of CALL: • Behaviouristic • Communicative • Integrative: ■ Multimedia - Internet At the time of writing this article, we are well into phase three. We have progressed beyond the behaviouristic phase, which began with the first CALL programs in the 1960s and extended into the early 1980s. Since the late 1970s we have dabbled in various ways with the communicative approach — and will probably continue to do so for some time. IILl. Multimedia Multimedia CALL, which became widely available towards the end of the 1980s, was a breakthrough insofar as it offered high-quality sound and video that could be integrated with the well-established combinations of text and graphics. Initially, multimedia was only made possible via interactive videodiscs, which required expensive and cumbersome equipment. Some interesting interactive videodisc products emerged: Montevidisco (Schneider & Bennion 1984), Expodisc (Davies 1991), A la rencontre de Philippe (Fuerstenberg 1993). All of these fall into the category of simidations. Interactive videodiscs were supplanted by CD-ROMs, which ran on much less expensive and more compact equipment, but the video quality they offered was pitiful compared to that offered by the earlier 1 2-inch videodiscs. This forced CALL software developers to take a major leap backwards. Pedagogy was sacrificed at the expense of technology, and few imaginative, language-oriented simulations were produced for many years — LPI’s Oscar Lake series being a notable exception: http://www.languagepub.com. It is only recently, with the advent of DVDs, that video quality has caught up with that offered by older technology. More recently, we have seen programs incorporating speech technology — formerly the preserve of institutions with huge R&D budgets — and it is now possible to interact with a computer using one’s voice as well as the keyboard and mouse. Popular programs such as Syracuse’s Triple Play Plvs (now known as Smart Start) and Auralog’s Tell Me More Pro have brought speech technology to the masses. My latest mobile phone incorporates speech technology, so that now when 1 am away from home I don’t have to dial the number but simply press a button and say “phone home” clearly — and it works! © Servicio de Publicaciones.

The Internet There is no doubt that the Internet — especially the World Wide Web, which is a subset of the Internet — has made an enormous impact on many people’s lives. The Web dates back to 1 989, when Tim Berners-Lee’s brilliant flash of insight spawned HTML (Berners-Lee 1998). Berners- Lee came up with the idea of the Web as a solution to the problem of information continually getting lost while he was working at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva. As a newcomer to CERN, he found it difficult to find out what was going on, and the Web — initially confined to CERN — was born. When the first Web browser was released in 1993 it became possible for the layperson to access information that previously only computer scientists had been able to retrieve using more complex tools. It did not take long for teachers to realise what a valuable source of information they now had at their fingertips — information that they could download and exploit in the classroom. Later on, the Web began was used to store and present interactive exercises. But then pedagogy took another leap backwards, as most of the earlier Web-based exercises were just sets of multiple- choice or gap-filling drills of the “point-and-click-let’s-move-on-quick” variety. Web-based interactive materials have undoubtedly improved but they have a long way to go before they catch up with the pedagogy and functionality offered by CALL programs delivered on CD-ROM or DVD. Only the delivery medium has improved, as Web-based activities can be accessed anytime and anywhere — at least in theory. The Web has initiated a veritable revolution in education, especially in the areas in distance learning and New Learning Environments (NLE). NLE has become closely associated with the Web. 1 say “associated with” because NLE is a difficult term to define precisely. Originally, NLE was associated with a wide range of technologies and their applications to learning. It embraces a vision of learning that encourages learner independence (learner autonomy), and offers opportunities for distance learning and life-long learning, with the teacher becoming more of a facilitator than instructor. In recent years, however, the focus in NLE appears to be on the Web as the main delivery medium. My personal view is that this focus is far too narrow, as it overlooks the benefits of other tried and tested technologies. But educational institutions are rushing headlong into putting all their learning materials on the Web, in spite of the fact that there are many aspects of CALL that cannot (yet) be executed properly on the Web. CD-ROMs and DVDs — and even the interactive videodiscs of the 1 980s — are far superior at handling sound and video, for example, which is why a hybrid approach is necessary. Furthermore, the role of the teacher in the language learning process is crucial to success. The Web is undoubtedly a remarkable invention. My home telephone bill bears testimony to the many hours that 1 spend “surfing the Web” and managing three different websites. Thanks to the Web 1 am now able to carry out research that would not have been possible in pre-Web times. But there is, as Claire Bradin puts it, a “Dark Side of the Web” (Bradin 1 997). In spite of © Servicio cic Publicaclones. Universidad de Murcia. AH rights reserved. UES, vol.2(I), 2002, pp. 1-18 JCT and Modern Foreign Lan^uaf^es: Learning Opporiunities and Trainirtf^ Needs 1 this negative sounding title, Bradin presents a realistic and balanced view of the pros and cons of the Web in language learning and teaching. Felix (2001) presents a comprehensive survey: a wealth of information on websites that learners and teachers of languages may find useful, as well as a number of detailed case studies and reports on research into students’ and teachers’ attitudes to learning languages via the Web. At the beginning of her work Felix makes the following statement — which should be heeded by all Web enthusiasts: “... it takes a very special person to learn and, especially, speak a language without face-to-face communication” (Felix 2001 :8). In her survey of available Web materials, it becomes clear (thankfully) that relatively few websites attempt to take the teacher out of the language learning process: ...what is freely accessible on the Web is often only part of a larger package that also invariably includes face-to-face teaching. It is likely that the most exciting learning takes place off-line in the creative processes negotiated between teachers and learners, sometimes across continents, in which the Web features as a tool rather than instructor. (Felix 2001: 190-191) The book concludes on a note which is both positive and realistic: Finally, however highly one rates the potential of the Web, it is difficult to imagine that any of this will ever replace best practice tace-to-face teaching. What is becoming more and more obvious with emerging research, is that the new technologies offer excellent potential for adding value to classroom teaching in a large variety of ways. (Felix 200 1 :358). The potential is there, the learning opportunities are there, but are the “customers” there? It was interesting to read the report in The Times (29 November 2000, p. 9) headed “King leaves Internet readers in suspense”. Stephen King has decided not to complete his Web novel The Plant because — according to King — “it failed to grab the attention of readers on the Web”. King found that a surprisingly high proportion of the readers accessing his site (75%-80%) made the “honesty payment” for being allowed to download chapters. “But”, he said, “there are a lot fewer of them coming. Online people have the attention span of a grasshopper.” Critics of the Web lament the disappearance of traditional educational environments, citing the dubious ethics of those who wish to turn our universities into “Digital Diploma Mills” — the title of a five-part series of articles by David Noble (Noble 1997-2001 ): In his classic 1959 study of diploma mills for the American Council on Education, Robert Reid described the typical diploma mill as having the following characteristics: “no classrooms,” “faculties are often untrained or nonexistent,” and “the officers are unethical self-seekers whose qualifications are no better than their offerings.” It is an apt description of the, digital diploma mills now in the making. Quality higher education will not disappear entirely, but it will soon become the exclusive preserve of the privileged, available only to children of the rich and the powerful. For the rest of us a dismal new era of higher education has dawned. In ten years, wc will look upon the wired remains of our once great democratic higher education system and wonder how we let it happen. That is, unless we decide now not to let it happen. (Noble: op. cit. Part I) Other critics include Press & Washburn. The preamble to their article entitled “Digital Diplomas” says it all: © Servieio cie Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. A/£5, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. 1-18 24 8 Graham Davies Welcome to the brave new world of higher education, where professors are “content experts,” classes are “courseware,” and students are customers. But just what is a dot-com degree worth?” (Press & Washburn 2001) Harsh words, but the above authors make some very important points that should not be overlooked in these times of technohype. The Web certainly has its “Dark Side”, and evidence is already emerging from North America that online learning may go the same way as some of the early Web businesses that have crashed so spectacularly. Evidence coming out of North America suggests that e-learning courses do not recruit well: In 1 997, facing a projected 50 percent increase in the state’s student population over the next decade, Utah governor Mike Leavitt announced the formation of Western Governors University, a cyber-college backed by governors from 1 9 states that now offers online courses from 40 schools. “We are turning around the old notion that to be educated one had to go somewhere,” Leavitt declared in a speech before the U.S. Senate’s Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. “We are going to bring the knowledge and information to the learner,” providing students with a high-quality education “while holding costs in check.” By January 2000, Western Governors University had enrolled a mere 200 degree-seeking students. (Press & Washburn 2001 ) There is no question that the Web is impressive as a collection of reference materials and as a delivery medium. It’s a huge library that is accessible from your home, and it contains an increasing wealth of resources for language teachers. But do we really want to deliver whole courses via the Web? Do we really want to deprive young people of the valuable experience of leaving home, studying and socialising with their peers, joining societies, going to clubs and parties, travelling, and falling in love? Do we really want to breed a generation of screen-gazing zombies? I fear that as e-learning expands we are losing sight of the essential difference between educations the growth of the self for one’s own lifelong purposes, and training, the shaping of an individual for others’ short-term purposes. E-learning is more suited to training rather than education. And who is going to employ someone who has obtained an e-languages degree? Most employers expect a languages graduate to have had many hours of face-to-face contact with native speakers and, preferably, to have spent a substantial period of residence abroad. Assessment is another issue; I would expect a languages graduate to have passed written and oral examinations that had taken place in a properly controlled environment. Learning languages via the Web is a controversial matter, but there is no question that the Web does offer considerable opportunities for the delivery of training materials. In the following sections I focus on the ICT4LT website as an example of a collection of ICT training materials for language teachers. 1 examine the aims behind the site as a whole and the pattern of visits to the site, discussing the key issues and drawing conclusions based on an analysis of the pattern of visits. © Servicio de Publicaciones.

Background The ICT4LT website is the outcome of a project funded under the Socrates Programme of the European Commission and is located at http://www.ict41t.org. It is the result of over two years’ intensive work by an international team of experts during the period September 1998 to Deeember 2000. The website offers 15 training modules in ICT for language teachers at three different levels in English, Italian, Swedish and Finnish, and it is continually updated. The original aim of the 1CT4LT project was to design a syllabus and to deliver a Web- based training course in ICT for teachers of modern foreign languages (MFL), but as the project progressed it became obvious that turning tlie materials into a full-blown course and getting the course accredited was much more difficult than anticipated. There were enormous administrative hurdles to overcome, and it was quickly realised that a considerable amount of online tutoring would be necessary — and costly. So at present the ICT4LT materials are mainly used as an online reference library. ICT4LT does, however, form the basis of ICT awareness and training courses delivered in the traditional way in many educational institutions, and also in connection with regular in-service training courses for teachers. The ICT4LT materials consist of 1 5 modules at three different levels: • Basic Level Module 1.1: Introduction to new technologies Module 1 .2: Introduction to computer hardware and software Module 1.3: Using text tools in the MFL classroom Module 1.4: Introduction to CALL Module 1.5: Introduction to the Internet • Intermediate Level Module 2.1: CALL methodology: integrating CALL into study programs Module 2.2: Introduetion to multimedia CALL Module 2.3: Exploiting WWW resources on-line and off-line Module 2.4: Using concordance programs in the MFL classroom Module 2.5: Introduetion to CALL authoring programs • Advanced Level Module 3.1: Managing a multimedia language centre Module 3.2: CALL software design and implementation Module 3.3: Creating a WWW site Module 3.4: Corpus linguistics Module 3.5: Human Language Technologies C> Servicio de Piibiicaciones.

A key question that has arisen as a result of piloting 1CT4LT is: To what extent do people perceive the Web as an interaetive learning environment? The evidence from the ICT4LT statistics is revealing. The ICT4LT website received around 40 000 “hits” in the three-month period September to November 2001 . This is an impressive indication that the site is regarded as a valuable bank of materials. In the same three months, feedback from visitors to the ICT4LT discussion list was zero. No one, apart from myself and one other member of the ICT4LT management team, contributed a single email to the discussion list, and I received no more than six personal emails from visitors to the site, all of which requested rather than offered information. This is in spite of the fact that the ICT4LT site contains numerous discussion topics to which site visitors are invited to contribute. This trend appears to be typical of the Web as a whole, i.e.: • Web people are habitual “lurkers”. • Web traffic is predominantly one-way, i.e. from the Web to the user. Some means must therefore be found to stimulate feedback and debate among Web users. It is likely that this will require more intensive online tutoring. IV.2. 2. Where do visitors to ICT4LT come from? A high proportion of visitors are based in educational institutions. Exact figures are difficult to come by, as often the visitor only leaves a numerical trace. The geographical pattern of visits to the ICT4LT site as a whole in the six-month period June-November 2001 is, however, revealing: • Nearly 82% of 1CT4LT site visits originated in Western Europe. This was to be expected, as the site is the outcome of a project initiated in the European Union. • Visits from the three geographical areas of (i) North America, (ii) Central/Eastern Europe and (iii) “wired-up” Asia (Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand) were in roughly equal numbers, with around 4% each of the total. • The next two main areas represented were (a) Australia/New Zealand and (b) Central/South America, with around 2.5% each. Significantly, Brazil led the field in Central/South America, with around 40% of the total number of visits from that area. • A mere 1 % of the total number of visits to the ICT4LT site originated in the rest of the world — which includes Africa, China, the Indian Subcontinent and the Middle East. 98% of the Servicio dc Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. /y£:S,vol.2(l), 2002, pp. 1-18 ICT and Modern Forci^i^n Lanfiua^es: Learning. OpporUmUies and Training Needs 11 visitors from Africa came from the Republic of South Africa and Namibia (a total of 119), while only 13 came from other African countries. Only 27 visits originated in the whole of the Indian Subcontinent, and only 4 in the most populous country in the world, namely China. These figures come as no surprise. They reflect what is already known about the Web in general: • The Web is not World Wide. • Access to the Web is restricted to the richer, liberal countries of the world, i.e. (i) those that can afford connectivity, and (ii) those that allow people free access to information. We have a long way to go before the dream of access to information anytime and anywhere on the Web is realised. IV.2,3, So What Do ICT4LT Visitors Want? Basically, they want information. An overwhelming number of visitors enter the ICT4LT site via the Index page and the language-specific Homepage. They start with an overview of what the site is all about. They then progress to the Contents page, which contains a list of the 15 ICT4LT modules. At this point the pattern of visits becomes interesting. The information that follows refers only to the English language section of the site. The Glossary ofTcrminolog}> and the Resource Centre are visited more than any of the ICT4LT modules, except Module 2.2 {Introduction to multimedia CALL), which is marginally ahead of the Glossary in terms of numbers of visits. This seems to indicate that a high proportion of visitors are just looking up information. In addition, people regularly navigate from links in the main modules to the Glossary and the Resource Centre. At the time of writing (December 2001), the order of popularity of the 15 modules is as follows. In the sections that follow I shall highlight the changes that have taken place in recent months and attempt to explain the pattern of visits. 1. Module 2.2: Introduction to multimedia CALL 2. Module 1.4: Introduction to CALL 3. Module 3.1: Managing a multimedia language centre 4. Module 1.1 : Introduction to new technologies 5. Module 2.4: Using concordance programs in the MFL classroom 6. Module 1.5: Introduction to the Internet 7. Module 1.3: Using text tools in the MFL classroom 8. Module 3.3: Creating a WWW site 9.

Basic Level Modules A high proportion of visitors to the ICT4LT site appear to be novices. The two modules that offer a general introduction to new technologies and language learning and teaching have remained for a long time near the top of the list of the most visited modules, and they are also the most popular Basic Level modules: namely Module LI and Module 1.4. Does this indicate that there are still a lot of newcomers to CALL out there? The answer is probably “Yes, there will always be beginners'’. Evidence suggests that these two modules are used by a number of universities and teacher training colleges as the basis of introductory courses in ICT and language learning and teaching. Module 1 .5, Iniroduction io the Internet, maintains a high position, but it has fallen from a higher slot. Does this indicate that teachers are becoming more knowledgeable about the Internet, or is there now a more realistic appreciation of what the Internet can offer in comparison, for example, with multimedia, which is dealt with in Module 2.2 {Introduction to multimedia CALL) and has shot to the top of the list of all 15 modules? Module 1 .3, which focuses on the use of generic text tools in the languages classroom, declined sharply in popularity a few months ago, but it is now creeping up the list again, possibly as a result of the new information we have provided on PowerPoint and how to incorporate sound and pictures into word-processed documents and PowerPoint presentations. Language teachers in the UK are strongly encouraged to make use of generic software tools, including word- processors, database software, desk-top publishing packages, and even spreadsheets. This makes sense, as the tools are available in most educational institutions, so additional software purchases are not necessary. On the other hand, the preparation time that is required to make good use of such tools is often discounted. Furthermore, some educational administrators simply wish to avoid setting aside a reasonable budget for the purchase of dedicated CALL materials, so there may be an ulterior motive in encouraging the use of generic packages: i.e. save money on software and make the teachers work harder. The introductory module on hardware and software. Module 1 .2, has fallen from a higher position and now occupies the lowest slot out of all the Basic Level modules. It is the only “technical” module at the 1CT4LT site — although it attempts to explain computer hardware and software in terms that the language teacher can understand.

Intermediate Level Modules Module 2,2, Introduction to multimedia CALL, has remained consistently the most popular module for many months. The module begins by defining multimedia and looking back at earlier developments in interactive video. Technical aspects are briefly covered, and a representative selection of CD-ROMs/DVD-ROMs is described, giving the reader an overview of the wide range of learning opportunities the medium offers. The renewed interest in multimedia is curious, because multimedia CALL is not a new phenomenon, having made its first appearance in the 1980s. But as soon as educational institutions began to buy multimedia CD-ROMs in reasonable quantities in around 1993-94, the Web made its public appearance, apparently offering learning materials free of charge. This appealed to budget managers who were put off by the high prices of the early CD-ROMs. CD- ROM prices then began to fall rapidly from figures such as 500 euros to more realistic figures of 60-70 euros. It was not easy to network the early CD-ROMs — and it can still be problematic — and language centre managers were not happy with the idea of buying lots of single-user copies and issuing them on demand to students. Finally, computer magazines started to give away CD- ROMs free, and the large computer stores began to offer “budget” CD-ROMs containing poor- quality materials. The overall result was that multimedia got a bad name. It is only now that CD- ROMs are beginning to make a comeback, and at last we have the high-quality video we require on DVD. This may explain the high level of interest in Module 2.2. In addition, ICT coordinators in educational institutions are becoming more aware of the variety of multimedia hardware and software that language teachers need. In the past it was not at all unusual for school network managers to have a very poor appreciation of the learning opportunities offered by multimedia to language students. 1 have been invited on several occasions to run workshops for language teachers on school computer networks that lacked one or all or the following: soundcards, headphones and microphones! The situation is changing, but perhaps not rapidly enough. Module 2.4, which deals with the use of concordance programs in the languages classroom, has climbed steadily from a very low position and has maintained its present position at No. 5 for several months. This seems to indicate a shift in methodology. Concordancers are useful in the following ways: • The teacher can use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar, typical collocations, etc. • The teacher can generate exercises based on examples drawn from a variety of corpora. © Servicio de Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. JJES, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. 1-18 30 14 Graham Davies • Students can work out rules of grammar and usage for themselves by searching for key words in context. « Students are encouraged to be sceptical about explicit rules by drawing on the data provided by authentic texts. Concordancers are not new, of course. The concept goes back hundreds of years, but it is only since the advent of the computer age that concordancer became commonplace tools for linguistic and literary researchers. Since the 1980s, concordancers have been available to the language teacher for classroom use — thanks to the pioneering work carried out by Tim Johns: http://web.bham.ac.ukyjohnstf Johns wrote one of the first commercially available classroom concordancers: MicroConcord. Using a concordancer, teachers can quickly produce handouts and exercises based on authentic materials but, more importantly, a concordancer turns the student into a researcher who can establish rules of grammar and usage for him/herself. In other words, concordancers have a key role to play in autonomous learning — or in Data-Driven Learning as Johns describes it. It is in the EFL world that concordancers have made their biggest impact, but it is clear from visits to the 1CT4LT site that MFL teachers are also beginning to see their value. Module 2.3, Exploiting WWW resources offline^ has fallen from a high position to No. 1 2 on the list. 1 find this difficult to explain, as it would seem logical to progress from an introduction to the Internet (Module 1 .5), which is still quite high in the list, to this module. One would therefore expect a higher proportion of visitors, but there is a fall-off of nearly 50%. Have the visitors had negative experiences with the Web and do not wish to find out more, or does the introductoiy module tell them all they need to know? Or, having looked at the other modules, do they find other things that are more interesting? Felix (2001) is enthusiastic about the usefulness of the Web in language learning and teaching, but she is also realistic and does not hesitate to mention its shortcomings compared to other delivery media, e.g. the problems associated with bandwidth and plug-ins, and the lack of universal standards for accessing the Web. CD-ROMs are still more reliable in delivering graphics, sound and video: While improvements have not been uniform, they have been achieved largely by way of better technologies tliat have led, among other things, to better presentation. This is notable in the case of graphics and sound, even if the Web still cannot malch the reliable quality offered by CD-ROM. [...] Technological advance, however, is not always an unmixed blessing; while we are still waiting for the long promised broadband services to become widely available, sites using the latest developments in graphics can take a wearying time to download over a 56K modem. There are other problems online, too — some plug-ins do not work in every context, and some sites are available only to Internet Explorer or Netscape, while others cater for Windows but not Macintosh. The Web’s ideal of universal standards is not always achieved.” (Felix 2001:189) This is why the designer of online language learning materials is advised to adopt © Servicio dc Publicaciones.

Module 2.5, which deals with authoring programs, has slipped down the list to position No. 13. This is the lowest position of the three modules that provide information for teachers interested in authoring their own materials. The other two modules in this category — 3.3 {Creating a WWW site) and 3.2 {CALL software design and implementation) — have dropped respectively to positions No. 8 and No. 9. Why has the do-it-yourself approach to CALL declined in popularity? Perhaps I was right when I made the following statement in an article written five years ago: The do-it-yourself approach to CALL software creation has rarely worked. Only those with hours of dcdicaiion at their disposal have made a success of it. The past is littered with dead authoring packages. (Davies 1997:41) It’s a question of time — which most language teachers do not have. Teachers are mainly interested in buying off-the-shelf materials or a simple authoring tool, e.g. Camsoft’s Fun with Texts or Wida Software’s Storyboard^ which generate a lot of work for the student with the minimum effort on the part of the teacher. Both of these packages continue to be bestsellers. It is significant that Module 3.3, Creating a WWW site, occupies the highest position of the do-it- yourself modules. This may be due to the availability of easy-to-use HTML authoring tools such as Front Page and Dreamweaver, and exercise generators such as Hot Potatoes. Or perhaps it has more to do with the Web as a convenient delivery medium — or an Intranet, which is becoming more common in educational institutions. Module 2.1 of ICT4LT is concerned with CALL methodology and ways of integrating CALL into study programmes. Bearing in mind the article by Jones cited earlier on in this article (Jones 1986), one would have expected this module to be a popular choice. Curiously, however, it has remained consistently the second least popular module for a period of many months. The module challenges views expressed by sceptics such as Oppenheimer (1997), to whom 1 refer at the beginning of this article. The author of Module 2.1 encourages the teacher to consider how students react to a piece of software and suggests a range classroom activities that the teacher might introduce in order to enhance the impact of ICT. Module 2.1, in other words, addresses both learner’s and teacher’s needs, but for some reason or other this does not have much appeal. Could it be that teachers are not interested in integration and that they would rather let the computer do all the work? © Servicio de Fublicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2 (1 ), 2002, pp. 1-18 32 16 Graham Davies IV.2.3.C. Advanced Lexel Modules One would expect advanced level modules in any set of learning/training materials to be lower in popularity than the earlier modules. There is a natural fall-off as leamers/trainees progress — which is well known to publishers of language learning materials: eourses for beginners bring in the money. It is no surprise therefore that the more academic modules, especially 3.4 {Corpus linguis(ics) and 3.5 {Human Language Technologies), are low down the list, respectively position No. 15 (bottom of the list) and position No. 9. Corpus linguistics is mainly of interest to university researchers, and Human Language Technologies appeal mainly to people who bridge the disciplines of human languages and computer science. Nevertheless, one cannot say that the number of visits to the pages of these two modules is insignificant. The most popular module. Introduction to multimedia CALL, receives three times as many visits as the least popular module, so the gap is not that wide. As indicated above, the do-it-yourself approach to CALL, which is covered in Module 3 .2, appears to be waning in popularity, apart from writing materials for the Web, which is covered in Module 3.3. Module 3.1, Managing a multimedia language centre, was conceived as a module for the advanced trainee. Its popularity at position No. 3 seems to indicate that everyone wants to manage a multimedia centre rather than teach! The module contains a number of case studies, which probably accounts for its appeal, and there is a strong emphasis on management of the learning environment, especially ways of encouraging learner autonomy. 1V.3. ICT4LT: The Future At present access to the 1CT4LT website is free of charge. For the time being the site will consist of a bank of materials that can be accessed and downloaded. There will be no online tuition, but visitors may continue to address questions to the management team and to members of the discussion list. Ways of integrating the materials into a Web-based learning environment such as Blackboard — with online tuition — are being considered. This is likely to be a lengthy process, however, and it is unlikely that the 1CT4LT bank of materials in its present form will disappear. 1 shall continue to update the site on a regular basis. One new modu\\e, Assessment and testing, is planned, and new case studies will be added to Module 3.1, Managing a multimedia language centre. Suggestions for further additions are welcomed. © Servicio de Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.

From a position in which technology enhanced language learning was at the forefront of pedagogic development, we now see a situation in which good design — both pedagogic and instructional — is all too often sacrificed for the sake of technological convenience. Some of the techniques which were possible using multimedia on a CD-ROM platform have all but disappeared as end users expect to find good learning experiences from the Web. One major reason why good design principles are often ignored in web-based learning design is the lack of sufficient, easy-to-use authoring tools, leading to an over-reliance on simple hypertext routines (though even with these there is no excuse for the woeful neglect of feedback techniques so often encountered), or the need to rely on technically trained personnel with an insufficient understanding of clear instructional design principles. Help is beginning to arrive with some good authoring systems, and this work looks at Hot Potatoes and MALTED, whilst at the same time postulating that a clear approach to pedagogic issues and, above all, instructional design work, can still create sound learning programs with even simple hypertext tools. The work concludes with a practical check-list of advice for the would-be author of language learning programs.

INTRODUCTION The massive growth in the provision of web pages, together with the vast increase of user access to them, has, of course, caused a revolution in the use of information, with personal, social and even political consequences never dreamt of when the Internet and the World Wide Web first began. As the Internet has developed, it has become more sophisticated, and new possibilities abound. The terms Internet and WWW are not synonymous — the Internet offers us more than the Web — including email and file transfers via FTP. The arrival of so-called “e-commerce” has been marked by a few notable events. These include the failure of many companies to return a profit, but alongside this the enormous “hype” which has led to over-high expectations. And this is where language learning comes in. Alongside the over-hyped arrival of e- commerce, we have seen the term “e-learning” being increasingly used. There has never been a completely satisfactory definition of that term. All that can be said is that it is infinitely preferable to “webucation”! There is another term, which is “web-based learning”, which is equally suspect, since it often means internet-hdiStd learning, involving (as it often does) e-mails and file transfers. This may seem like an exercise in hair-splitting, but in fact it has important consequences. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the enormous expectations of what should be delivered over the Internet in terms of language learning does not begin to be matched by the reality of what actually can be delivered. It will explore the reasons for this, which are complex, and which cover pedagogic and technical issues, and offer suggestions for a different approach which will both exploit the enormous potential which the Internet can offer, both now and in the foreseeable future, whilst being realistic about its limitations. Not least, it will mention the thorny subject of whether all this is value for money! II. THE SCOPE The Internet, as we have stated, can be used for many purposes. A work such as this cannot hope to cover all aspects. Therefore we will concentrate on the issue of second language acquisition (rather than cross-cultural training, etc.) and on the mechanisms for computer mediated learning for language skills. Furthermore, we will not attempt to address the use of email, chat-rooms, student management systems, video-conferencing, and the like. No inference should be made that any or all of these do not have value. But it is the pedagogic aspects that we will be exploring in terms of the synchronous learning environment that has been developed over the years. © Scrvicio dc Piiblicacioncs. Universidad dc Murcia.

THE BACKGROUND Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) covers a variety of areas, and the term '‘technology enhanced language learning” (or TELL) might be a better title. The reason for this is that many, rightly or wrongly, still associate CALL with text-based drills and exercises. But CALL (we shall continue to use the term) has progressed beyond measure over the years. The problem is that it is still largely viewed as experimental, or innovative, even though there has been enormous acceptance of its value and effectiveness. It is hard to see exactly why this should be so. Quite possibly it is that the language learning community was at the vanguard of computer mediated instruction for many years and in many ways — one only has to think of the way in which multimedia, and above all its sound facilities, has been embraced as being of very special benefit for our needs, rather than a useful extra aspect, as in many other learning disciplines. But now, and rather suddenly, the agenda has changed. The explosion in Internet use, and along with it the establishment and growth of “e-learning” sites, has kindled an expectation and a demand which is hard to satisfy. In spite of some embryonic disillusionment’, training over the Internet is a fact and looks like being here to stay. So why is language learning not out there with the best of them — showing the same levels of maturity and market penetration as other disciplines — notably those in management and business learning? Our contention is that there is one prime reason for this — the special nature of language learning itself — and that there are two obstacles to overcoming the problem, the first of which is technical, the second a design issue. IV. CHOPIN DIDN’T USE THE WEB When making comparisons with other disciplines, one has first to realise the contrast between skills-based and knowledge-based learning. Would you really expect to learn to play the piano from an Internet course? A search\" of the web revealed that such a web site does indeed exists but cannot get much further than displaying pages from a tutorial, seeming to forget the lesson most of us learnt long ago — that if it can be done better another way, then don’t do it! But in spite of this, it seems that the expectations (and not always from non-linguists, it has to be said) are high that the impossible can be achieved. Our “piano” is, of course, communication, and above all oral communication, and this means that we are in skills-based territory. It will take just a cursory glance at a few learning programmes on the Internet in disciplines other than language learning to show that the majority of them are knowledge-based, and require much simpler techniques — techniques in which the use of multimedia is incidental to the learning process and a part of the instructional design solution, whereas for language learning we have a different imperative — the need to have access to the sound of the language © Servicio dc Piiblicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. UES^ vol. 2 (1), 2002, pp. 19-30 38 22 Paul Bangs and, ideally, realia in terms of graphics and/or videos in order to put the language skills into context. For us, multimedia is the end as well as the means. After all, since we do this in the classroom as a matter of course, why should it be that different on the Internet? Ask yourself this question of many offerings on the Web — how much more does it offer us than a book? Because many web sites offer little more than a book enhanced by hyperlinks, accompanied by (often) poorly designed tests. V. WHAT WE KNOW WE CAN DO Technology frightens us by its ever-accelerating rate of change. This has enormous implications for pedagogy in general, and for language learning in particular. The introduction of sound and superior graphics opened up a world of advantage for us, and enabled the design of computer- aided routines that arguably put language learning in the forefront of the computer-aided learning field. But technological advance is not always the best thing — those who have been around CALL for a long time will recall that in the late 1980s we had access to full-screen, full-motion video through the use of the analogue interactive video system'*. The quality of this system is only just beginning to be matched by digital systems such as DVDRom, and the Web is a long way from achieving such quality at the current transmission rates. But the real problem has always been that of design and program creation. Good (and we emphasise the word) pedagogic design and sophisticated multimedia creation are both difficult and time-consuming. A major program or course could easily take two years to develop, by which time the technical platform may well have changed. In spite of all the experiments, evaluations and information exchange in this field (and CALL is one of the most openly collaborative disciplines there is^), we only just begin to scratch the surface of what is possible before new techniques and new skills are required. Nevertheless, CALL has achieved a considerable respect as a discipline in its own right, and as a result of this, there is much consensus as to good practice and design of materials with respect to the computer itself — leaving aside the Internet for the moment. Such consensus is not restrictive, and different pedagogic approaches can be catered for — including many degrees of constructivism. Above all, one could cite the question of feedback as being the most important factor of all, and one to which we shall return later. It is notour intention to try to describe in any detail here the various components that go to make up good pedagogic and instructional design for language learning, and there are other places where one can receive support^. The point is that we have just reached what could be described as a ‘‘plateau” where we might in theory draw breath and take stock — create a wider range of sound programs and routines, develop good authoring techniques and platforms, work out global parameters for instructional design and so on. The plateau has occurred because of a momentary (and relative) stabilisation of our platform © Scrvicio de Publicaciones. Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2 (1), 2002, pp. 19-30 39 Aiuhoring, Pech^o^> and tha Wvb: Expectations Versus Reality 23 — ubiquitous CD-ROM and multimedia hardware, cheap memory, speech recognition potential not yet fulfilled, etc. — but we have been unable to take advantage of the situation and perfect our techniques. Why? Because everyone wants the Web! Before we move on to discuss the Web itself, it would be apposite just to refer to a few of the techniques we can accept as “standard”. These techniques refer to the level of interactivity that we can use to support language learning. We are now very used to text-entry routines, although these are becoming rarer and tend to be used at the lower levels. Drag and drop, click to match, clicking on options, all spring to mind. In fact there are relatively few things a computer can do in terms of computer interactivity — it is the way in which these routines are incorporated into instructional designs that distinguishes different usage. To give an example, one of the things that a computer does best is to branch — in other words to do something different according to differing user input. The classic way in which this is used is for multiple choice routines. But branching can be used in a variety of ways — multiple choice questions (MCQs) can be of the “classic” style, but there is no reason why the same computer interactivity cannot be used for a variety of different instructional design set-ups. MCQs could have more than one, or every answer, right, or all wrong, and could offer feedback to assist the progress of the learner. Instead of the more conventional choice-making routines, learners could make choices that lead to a further “branch” to enable them to view the consequences of their choices — a different form of intrinsic feedback known as “conditional branching”. All these stem from the same basic computer function. But in addition, the advent of multimedia has given us a new dimension in terms of interactivity. Not only can we listen to sound (which of course was always possible with a tape recorder), but we can ally sounds to other routines (such as multiple selection) and get feedback from discriminatory choices involving sound, something which is only possible with a computer (or with that other computer, the human being!). We can interact with video clips in the same way. We can also input the human voice with sound capture techniques, role-play and get the user to perfect his/her utterances, and so on. All these are now aceepted as standard techniques and there are many authoring systems, of various levels of quality and necessitating various levels of technical knowledge, to enable us to create courseware that is technically and pedagogically sound. VI. WHAT WE (ALMOST) CAN’T DO AND WHY WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO IT But the well-known principle we should apply to computer-based materials: if it’s better done on paper, then do it on paper; or if it’s better done in the classroom then do it there seems to get thrown out of the window when it comes to using the Web. © Servicio dc Publicaciones. Univcrsidad de Murcia. All rights reserved. UES, vol. 2(1), 2002, pp. 19-30 24 Paul Bangs Most of US have learnt over the years that it should be the pedagogy whieh drives materials ereation, not the technology — even though there are those who do not seem to have learnt this message yet! The starting point should never be the technology, whether we are talking about platform or software, but the learning design principles. So if this were to be applied to the Web, we would have to conclude that many things cannot be done via the Internet or would be better done through another medium. This next part of the work will examine this problem. The problem which has arisen now is that the Internet, and in particular its component element, the Web, offers us a different and highly restricted range of technical opportunities for delivering language learning. HTML is de facto the default system for all Web browsers and that leaves us with a major problem — and one that is far more serious for us in the language learning community than it might be for other learning disciplines. HTML, unless enhanced (more later on this), employs the basic “click and go” function which is similar to the computer interaction described in the last section. When a “hyperlink” is clicked, the “page” is replaced by something else — although there are some relatively easy ways to enhance this, such as using “frames”, which offer a limited though valuable extra dimension. Other forms of interactivity are not generally possible (other than a limited use of sound playback) without “enhancing” HTML routines. So the obvious inference is that we should use these enhancements. If only life were that simple.... Whereas there is a whole raft of authoring systems for non-web based computer interactions which ensure that we do not have to be C++ or Visual Basic programmers, (some of them specific to language learning), very few such authoring programs exist for us to exploit the use of the Web. In fact, it is relatively easy to create simple routines using HTML programs which are often not recognised as authoring systems — such as Microsoft Front Page® — but when one progresses to the creation of higher levels of interactivity, the additional routines that have to be used “on top of’ HTML, such as Java, JavaScript, Flash, Shock Wave and so on, demand a learning curve which is relatively high and will not appeal to any but the most die-hard enthusiast programmer/linguist. Thus having to have recourse to programmers for these techniques ensures that there is a h"
