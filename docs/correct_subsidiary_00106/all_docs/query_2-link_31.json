        "text": "E-Learning Fundamentals Prepared for January 2004\n\nPurpose of Meeting • Provide a basic understanding of • e-learning, • its principles and • possible approaches www.feenix.co.uk\n\nIntroduction FeeNix e-Learning background ‘Qualified’ to talk about e-learning and standards E-Learning background and definitions What is e-learning? Definition Physical and conceptual components Demo of a LMS and some content Quality Considerations Maximising Impact and uptake Typical Implementations Case studies lessons learned Standards AICC and SCORM History Why the standards are necessary Certification and compliance Who is Definitions and differences Pros,Cons and Gotchas Mandatory and Optional data elements Things you need to know… LMS supplier Content Supplier References Agenda www.feenix.co.uk\n\nWhat is E-Learning Physical and conceptual components Demo of a LMS and some content\n\nA definition of e-learning • “Any learning, training or education that is facilitated by the use of well-know and proven computer technologies, specifically networks based on Internet technology.” • the learning content is stored on a web server • accessed via a browser and the TCP-IP network protocol www.feenix.co.uk\n\nTypes of e-Learning • ‘Blended’ learning is a combination of: • Face to Face - Classroom or sales calls • Materials - Books / videos / CDs / brochures • E-learning – On-line via Internet or Intranet • Synchronous (Using collaboration tools) • Interactive on-line chat • Electronic whiteboards • Presentation delivery • Virtual Symposiums • Asynchronous (Web-based version of CBT (CD-ROM) • E-learning, e-detailing • Most of the work done on e-learning standards is concerned with asynchronous e-learning www.feenix.co.uk\n\nThe Sector Split • Corporate market • LMS – Learning Management Systems • Just in time learning • Academic market • VLE – Virtual Learning Environment • Tutor contact time is important – collaboration tools • Qualifications are important • Links to funding councils • LSC – Learning and Skills council www.feenix.co.uk\n\nPhysical E-Learning Components • Courseware / Content • Sequential Lessons • Assessments (pre, post, embedded) • LMS / ‘wrapper’ • a suite of functionalities designed to deliver, track, report on and manage learning content, student progress and student interactions. • LCMS • Content creation, storage and organisation • Collaboration Tools • Contact between learners and tutors • Development/Authoring Tools • Specialised tools for producing e-learning content www.feenix.co.uk\n\nContent ProvidersOff the shelf www.feenix.co.uk\n\nCourseware 2 • Bespoke • External • 1 hour of content could cost £20k depending on the interactivity and richness of the media • Video • Audio • Games www.feenix.co.uk\n\nCourseware 3 • Creating bespoke content internally • Content creation team: • SME (subject matter expert) • Instructional Designer • Graphics designer • Programmer • Authoring Tools • Macromedia: Flash, Authorware, Coursebuilder (dreamweaver); Toolbook II • Lectora publisher, Trainer soft • MM Breeze, Robopresenter, Impatica www.feenix.co.uk\n\nHighly generalised LMS www.feenix.co.uk\n\nLMS’s • LMS focused • HR Focused www.feenix.co.uk\n\nConceptual E-learning Components • The Learning Object (LO) • Smallest chunk of content to stand alone as a meaningful unit • Size is determined by the authors • E.g. differences between Netg and Knowledgepool • In standards terms –smallest trackable unit • E.g. one ‘assessment’ per LO • Re-useable is key • smaller and focused • 20 minute maximum www.feenix.co.uk\n\nTraining Manager Database Server ODBC WBT Manager Database ODBC HTTP WBT Manager Web Module Web Server Demo of LMS plus content Students and Local administrators www.feenix.co.uk\n\nGeneral Demo • Log-on • Home page • Launch a lesson • Complete some learning • View the reports www.feenix.co.uk\n\nE-Learning Standards History Why the standards are necessary\n\nWhere when and who? • Early 1980’s Aviation industry was the first to adopt CBT on a large scale • Sophisticated aircraft • Keeping personnel up-to-date • Safety • Records • Why CBT? • Media –rich, interactive v printed manual • Additional assessment and data tracking • 24/7 availability • Just in time access to most up to date info • Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell-Douglas …. • Proprietary hardware and software • High cost, records on multiple computers www.feenix.co.uk\n\nHistory continued • 1988 Aviation Industry CBT Committee (AICC) was formed • International group – manufacturers, trainers (military, commercial and civilian) government and regulatory, e-learning vendors and courseware developers • Hardware was ‘sorted’ first • 1993 – guideline for computer managed instruction interoperability • 1998 – web-based version • 1991 – Gulf War • After war – US congress studies concluded that reserve forces needed improved access to education and training • Funds went to National Guard for prototype e-learning classrooms and networks • 1997 – Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative (ADL) • US Department of Defence Expanded this work and founded ADL • Publishing first specification of SCORM in 1999 • Other standards bodies were IMS and IEEE www.feenix.co.uk\n\nWhy Do We Need Standards? • “..must be a common way • to start content, • for content to communicate with an LMS and • predefined data elements that are exchanged between an LMS and content during its execution.” SCORM overview • So that: • Mix and match content from multiple sources • in-house • off-the-shelf • Re-use content • Avoid proprietary systems • Future-proof e-learning investment www.feenix.co.uk\n\nDefinitions Which Standards Who is certified/compliant\n\nWhich Standards? • AICC CMI Specification (AGR 010) • www.aicc.org • The Aviation Industry CBT Committee (AICC) has developed a specification that allows courseware from multiple vendors to communicate with a single LMS. The AICC specification has been widely adopted outside the airline industry. • ADL SCORM • www.adlnet.org • More recently the Advanced Distributed Learning initiative (ADL) has developed the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) specification to open e-learning standards to a wider audience. Much of SCORM is based on AICC but some components have been implemented differently. www.feenix.co.uk\n\nE-Learning Standards Evolution www.feenix.co.uk\n\nStandards Certification • AICC CMI Specification • Certification • self-test • Designed to the guidelines • ADL SCORM • certification • self-test www.feenix.co.uk\n\nProducts that can be AICC-Certified • LMS • LMS - Application Service Provider (ASP) • Assignable Unit (Lesson/LO) • WBT Courses - Collection of Learning Objects within an AICC/LMS course structure • Courseware generation and assessment tools • Authoring Systems/Tools www.feenix.co.uk\n\nWho is AICC Certified?(14) • WBT Manager* • TopClass • Docent • Saba3 • Pathlore LMS • THINQ • ConXerto Achieve (Hk) • DIDA GROUP S.p.A (Italian) • Getronics S.p.A. • Miraenet Co., Ltd. (Korean) • Samsung SDS • Mediopia • Plateau 4 LMS (US) • Maritz Learning (US) www.feenix.co.uk\n\nNon-LMS AICC products • Courseware • Skillsoft Corporation /Smartforce • SmartForce • Coastal Training Technology Corporation • ElementK • CoursewareGeneration/Assessment Systems • Question Mark - Perception • CentraOne • Authoring Tools • None www.feenix.co.uk\n\nWho is SCORM Certified • WebMentor Avilar Technologies, Inc. • Knowledge Centre Meridian Knowledge Solutions, Inc. • Semvra ACORDE Media, S.A. • Kontext Advanced Learning Lab, Ltd. • NetCampus21 Alex IT • Desire2Learn SCORM Component Desire2Learn Inc. • WebAula Corporate Zargon Computacao Ltda. aka Zargon & Poliedro e-Le • NEP (Next Education Platform) K1system co.

Media – video, graphics sound AICC Course Instructional Block Assignable Unit (AU) - Lesson AICC’s LO Curricular Taxonomies • Set of named hierarchical learning levels www.feenix.co.uk\n\nAICC/SCORM in ShortWhat’s the difference? • AICC – CMI Specification • Two communication methods • HACP (HTTP-based AICC CMI Protocol) • JavaScript API(application programming interface) • Has had certification testing for LMS/content/tools since 1999 • Doesn’t specify meta-data to describe LOs or course structures • SCORM 1.2 • JavaScript API only • Certification has only been available since 2003 • Meta-data specification for LOs (optional) • Meta-data specification for content packaging www.feenix.co.uk\n\nSCORM www.feenix.co.uk\n\nDescriptive Wrapper www.feenix.co.uk\n\nAPI & HACP www.feenix.co.uk\n\nPros Cons & Gotchas www.feenix.co.uk\n\nFirewall and security problems • A significant number of LMS vendors implement the API as a Java applet that runs on the student browser. Java applets tend to be seen as a security risk and many firewalls block them entirely, some IT departments configure the browsers to disable support for Java. • HACP does not have this problem. www.feenix.co.uk\n\nWorks with any content server? • The “gotcha” for the API is the result of a built in security feature with Internet Explorer (IE). If: • your learning content is not in the same domain as your LMS • some content providers suggest that the content stay on their own severs and your organisation’s LMS is just pointed to it • the content uses API • the student is using an IE browser • then no communication will take place. • Options: • use HACP instead of API • Use Netscape • SCORM development committees have published a document detailing some technical ‘work-arounds’ in Oct 2003 www.feenix.co.uk\n\nFully compatible with HTML plus JavaScript content? • The HACP “gotcha” is that two way communication is not possible with content created with HTML plus JavaScript because although JavaScript (the programming language built into most Web Browsers) can readily send data to the LMS in the required HACP format, it cannot receive the HACP messages that the LMS returns, so for example ‘booking marking’ it not possible. www.feenix.co.uk\n\nStandards Data Model Core Optional\n\nStudent ID Student name Lesson location Credit Lesson Mode Lesson status Path Score Time Core Data Model The following data is sent to a lesson when it is launched. Similar data is returned to the LMS when the lesson completes. Note: SCORM has a slightly reduced data model overall www.feenix.co.uk\n\nOptional Data Model Elements - Grouped • Core • Mandatory plus lesson mode (browsing .reviewing) • Comments • Brief free-form test comments: LMS can send comments from admin + LO can send comments from the learner • Evaluation • Used for evaluation the effectiveness of the LO • not included in the SCORM data set • Objectives • Records scores and status info for identified learning objectives • Student data • E.g. mastery score, time limit, action if time limit exceeded. • AICC also tracks info about multiple attempts • Student demographics • Background info about the learner • Not included in the SCORM data set • Student preferences • For presentation of LO, appearance, sound, language etc. www.feenix.co.uk\n\nExample 1: Attempt Number • Definition: This AICC-only element indicates the number of times a student has previously entered the lesson. The LMS initializes this value to \"0\" the first time the student enters the lesson and increments it on each subsequent entry. The lesson determines how, if at all, this value is used. • Direction of travel: Lesson to LMS; LMS to lesson • AICC HACP name: Attempt_Number • AICC API name: cmi.student_data.attempt_number • SCORM API name: not supported www.feenix.co.uk\n\nExample 2: Objective Status • Definition: The student's current status in the objective. Objectives Status may be set to one of six defined values: Not Attempted, Browsed, Incomplete, Completed, Passed, or Failed. • Direction of travel: LMS to lesson; lesson to LMS • AICC HACP name: Objectives_Status.n • AICC API name: cmi.objectives.n.status • SCORM API name: cmi.objectives.n.status www.feenix.co.uk\n\nDemo of optional elements • Tracking and Reports • Objectives • Interactive • Prerequisites • Completion requirements www.feenix.co.uk"
