Basis of Presentation\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Saba Software, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Saba or the Company). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2011, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010 are unaudited. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of the Companys financial position as of August 31, 2011, and the Companys results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2011 is derived from the May 31, 2011 audited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Sabas audited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Sabas Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on August 5, 2011. The results of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2011, are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 or for any future period.\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company generates revenues from the sale of subscription services, professional services and software licenses and recognizes revenues when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\npersuasive evidence of an agreement exists;\n\n\n\ndelivery has occurred;\n\n\n\ncollection is probable.\n\nSubscription Services Arrangements\n\nSubscription services arrangements generally include a combination of our products delivered via an internet-based cloud architecture, product updates and support related to licenses and professional services. Subscription revenue includes revenue from cloud-based offerings and product updates and support related to licenses.\n\nRevenue from cloud-based offerings that are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access the Companys software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of the Companys software are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered or on an as-used basis if defined in the contract.\n\nSaba does not grant its resellers the right of return and does not recognize revenue from resellers until an end-user has been identified and the other conditions of software revenue recognition guidance are satisfied. Revenue from product updates, support and hosting services related to licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered or on an as-used basis if defined in the contract.\n\nWhen subscription services arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available; (ii) third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best estimate of selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\n\nThe Company determines VSOE based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, the Company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately.\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nWhen VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, the Company applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, the Companys go-to-market strategy differs from that of its peers and its offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, the Company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the Company has not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\n\nWhen it is unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company determines BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices it charges for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices.\n\nThe Company has not historically priced its cloud-based offerings within a narrow range and limited historical renewal rate information is available based on the life cycle of these offerings. As a result, the Company uses BESP in order to allocate the selling price to cloud-based deliverables. In general, the Company uses VSOE in order to allocate the selling price to professional service deliverables.\n\nCertain cloud-based offerings include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of the Companys software. When these offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance.\n\nProfessional Services\n\nProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. Although the Company generally provides professional services on a time-and-materials basis, certain services agreements are provided on a fixed-fee basis. For services performed on a fixed-fee basis, revenues are generally recognized using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on hours of work performed. For contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software, the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method or, if Saba is unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services, Saba uses the completed-contract method of accounting in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance and relevant guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-35 Construction-Type and Certain ProductionType . A contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer.\n\nIf the requirements of software revenue recognition are not met when the Company bills a customer or a customer pays the Company, the billed or paid amount is recorded as deferred revenue, which is a liability account. As the revenue recognition criteria of software revenue recognition are satisfied, the requisite amounts are recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company classifies deferred revenue and deferred costs on its consolidated balance sheet as current if the Company expects to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months. When the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription for transactions entered into prior to adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (ASU 2009-13), the Company allocates the revenue to professional services revenue and to subscription revenue based on the VSOE of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement. The Companys judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of the Companys revenue recognition and results of operations.\n\nSoftware License Arrangements\n\nSoftware license arrangements generally include a combination of the Companys software, license updates and product support and/or professional services. A significant amount of the Companys software license arrangements are for perpetual licenses.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue earned on perpetual software license arrangements in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance. When software arrangements involve multiple elements, the Company recognizes license revenue, using the residual method. Under the residual method revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amount of the arrangement is allocated to delivered elements. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method. The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nLicense revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of ASC 985-605 are satisfied. License revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. In arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, The Company allocates the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the VSOE of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual licenses of similar products. The Company does not grant its resellers the right of return and does not recognize revenue from resellers until an end-user has been identified and the other conditions of software revenue recognition are satisfied.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company performs fair value measurements in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.\n\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An assets or liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\nThe following table presents the liabilities carried at fair value as of August 31, 2011:\n\nFair Value Measurements Using\n\nDescription\n\nAs of\n\nAugust 31,\n\n2011 Quoted Prices in\n\nActive Market for\n\nIdentical Assets\n\n(Level 1) Significant Other\n\nObservable\n\nInputs\n\n(Level 2) Significant Other\n\nUnobservable\n\nInputs\n\n(Level 3) (in thousands)\n\nLiabilities:\n\nAcquisition contingent consideration\n\n$ 2,715 $  $  $ 2,715\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n$ 2,715 $  $  $ 2,715\n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related liability-classified contingent consideration using the probability weighted expected pay-out model. The key assumptions in applying the approach is the probability of certain customer renewal weight targets and revenue booking targets. The contingent consideration liabilities are classified as Level 3 liabilities, because the Company uses unobservable inputs to value them, reflecting the Companys assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities.\n\nThe following table presents the Companys liabilities that were measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three month period ended August 31, 2011. These consisted of the Companys contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions:\n\n(in thousands) Contingent\n\nConsideration\n\nBalance at May 31, 2011\n\n$ 2,574\n\nAccretion and foreign exchange loss\n\n141\n\nPayments\n\n\n\nBalance at August 31, 2011\n\n$ 2,715\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets, to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, therefore, actual results may differ from estimates. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe fair value of asset acquired and liabilities assumed are estimated using various valuation approaches, which include unobservable inputs that reflect the Companys assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value such assets and liabilities. Significant inputs to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, discount rates, probability of future cash pay-outs related to contingent consideration, and future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, acquired developed technologies and patents and brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the Companys product portfolio. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any changes to such fair value recorded to the Companys condensed consolidated statement of operations. Each reporting period the accretion of interest on contingent consideration is also calculated and recorded as interest expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.\n\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company reevaluates these items quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period and the Company continues to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or the Companys final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect the Companys provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.\n\n3. Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of its share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards in accordance with ASC 718-10 Compensation  Stock Compensation.\n\nThe Company currently uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the awards, the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends. The Company estimates the expected term of the share-based awards using its historical option activities, including option exercises, restricted stock units and holding patterns. The Company estimates the volatility using its historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the options. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate that it uses in the option valuation model on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining maturities similar to the expected term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. The expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe following assumptions have been used to value the options and awards granted during the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, under the Companys stock incentive plans and stock purchased under the Companys employee stock purchase plan:\n\nThree months ended\n\nAugust 31, 2011 2010\n\nStock Options:\n\nExpected volatility\n\n56 % 57 %\n\nRisk-free interest rates\n\n1.34 % 2.08 %\n\nExpected term (years)\n\n4.8 5.7\n\nExpected dividend yield\n\n0 % 0 %\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan:\n\nExpected volatility\n\n38 % 51 %\n\nRisk-free interest rates\n\n0.29 % 0.40 %\n\nExpected term (years)\n\n0.5  2.0 0.5  2.0\n\nExpected dividend yield\n\n0 % 0 %\n\nThe following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock units and the Companys employee stock purchase plan shares that was recorded in the Companys condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively:\n\nThree months ended\n\nAugust 31, 2011 2010 (in thousands)\n\nCost of revenues:\n\nSubscription\n\n$ 36 $ 49\n\nProfessional services\n\n61 58\n\nResearch and development\n\n127 123\n\nSales and marketing\n\n263 279\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n547 305\n\nShare-based compensation expense included in net loss\n\n$ 1,034 $ 814\n\nThe share-based compensation expense categorized by various equity components is summarized in the table below:\n\nThree months ended\n\nAugust 31, 2011 2010 (in thousands)\n\nStock options\n\n$ 565 $ 658\n\nRestricted stock units\n\n413 147\n\nEmployee stock purchase plan\n\n56 9\n\nTotal share-based compensation\n\n$ 1,034 $ 814\n\nRSUs granted by the Board of Directors have been awarded under the Companys 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Stock Plan) and the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2009 Stock Plan). The RSUs generally vest in four annual installments commencing on the one year anniversary of the date of the award. During the quarter ended August 31, 2011, 116,250 shares of the RSUs vested. In order to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations that arose on the vesting of restricted stock units, 41,852 shares of common stock pursuant to our restricted stock units were repurchased for an aggregate price of approximately $372,000.\n\nThe weighted average estimated fair value of options granted was $4.44 and $2.60 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of RSUs granted was $9.31 and $4.90 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\n4. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share information for all periods is presented under the requirements of ASC 260-10 Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Basic loss per share excludes the dilutive effects of options. Dilutive potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock unit awards under the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive issuances have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, which consist of common stock options, restricted stock unit awards and common stock subject to repurchase. The calculations of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:\n\nThree months ended August 31, 2011 2010 (in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNet loss\n\n$ (5,796 ) $ (1,695 )\n\nWeighted-average shares of common stock used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share\n\n28,387 28,151\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per share\n\n$ (0.20 ) $ (0.06 )\n\nIf the Company had generated net income for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, 2.8 million and 1.2 million common equivalent shares, respectively, would have been added to the basic weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the period.\n\nShares used in diluted net income per common share calculations exclude anti-dilutive common equivalent shares, consisting of all stock options and restricted stock units, if they have exercise prices that are higher than the average market price of the Companys common stock during the respective periods, under the treasury method. These anti-dilutive common equivalent shares totaled 1.3 million and 3.7 million shares for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. While these common equivalent shares are currently anti-dilutive, they could be dilutive in the future.\n\n5. Comprehensive Loss\n\nThe Company reports comprehensive loss in accordance with ASC 220-10 Comprehensive Income. The following table sets forth the calculation of comprehensive loss for all the periods presented:\n\nThree months ended August 31, 2011 2010 (in thousands)\n\nNet loss\n\n$ (5,796 ) $ (1,695 )\n\nForeign currency translation gain (loss)\n\n(58 ) 74\n\nComprehensive loss\n\n$ (5,854 ) $ (1,621 )\n\n6. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\n\nThe primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of Comartis Group Ltd. (Comartis) and Pedagogue Solutions (Pedagogue) that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value measurements of uncertain tax positions. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist it in determining the fair values of the uncertain tax positions at the acquisition dates during the measurement period.

All intangible assets as of August 31, 2011 are expected to be fully amortized by May 31, 2021.\n\n7. Debt and Other Obligations\n\nCredit Facility\n\nOn June 27, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo (the Amended Agreement), which supersedes the Companys prior line of credit, increases the available revolving credit limit to $40 million and extends the term of the line of credit to June 27, 2016.\n\nBorrowings under the Amended Agreement bear interest based on the higher of the following calculated rates: (i) a fluctuating rate per annum of the applicable margin plus the base rate in effect (as defined in the Amended Agreement) or (ii) a fixed rate per annum determined by Wells Fargo to be the applicable margin plus the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) in effect at the date of borrowing.\n\nThe line of credit is secured by all of the Companys personal property other than its intellectual property. The line of credit also is guaranteed by, and secured by the assets of, the Companys material domestic subsidiaries. The Amended Agreement includes certain covenants with which the Company must comply during the term of the Amended Agreement, including a minimum EBITDA covenant that applies only if liquidity (defined as cash plus available unused borrowings under the credit line) drops below $15 million. The Amended Agreement also includes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants.\n\nThe Amended Agreement contains usual and customary events of default (subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company may be required to repay the obligations under the line of credit prior to the stated maturity date, the Companys ability to borrow under the Amended Agreement may terminate, and the Bank may be able to foreclose on any or all collateral provided by the Company or the Companys subsidiaries.\n\nNo amounts have been borrowed under the Amended Agreement as of August 31, 2011; however, the Company was in compliance with the Amended Agreements covenants and could have borrowed against the Amended Agreement as of August 31, 2011.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nDuring the quarter ended August 31, 2010, the Company entered into a non-cancelable three year contract for software services of which $1.2 million remained as of August 31, 2011.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Companys future minimum lease payments and contract obligations as of August 31, 2011.\n\nPayments due by fiscal year Total FY 2012 FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Thereafter (in thousands)\n\nContractual obligations:\n\nLong-term contract commitment\n\n$ 1,185 $ 462 $ 667 $ 56 $  $  $ \n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n14,782 2,899 3,583 2,096 1,199 1,196 3,809\n\nTotal\n\n$ 15,967 $ 3,361 $ 4,250 $ 2,152 $ 1,199 $ 1,196 $ 3,809\n\n8. Guarantees\n\nThe Company enters into license agreements that generally provide indemnification for its customers against intellectual property claims. To date, the Company has not incurred any costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Companys license agreements also generally include a warranty that its software products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of generally 90 days after delivery. To date, the Company has not incurred or accrued any material costs associated with these warranties.\n\nOther guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Companys executive officers, non-employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses, damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative, legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on behalf of the Company. Historically, minimal costs have been incurred relating to such indemnifications and, as such, no accruals for these guarantees have been made.\n\n9. Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax provision for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Income tax provision for both of the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted primarily of state taxes as well as foreign tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits.\n\nAs of August 31, 2011 and May 31, 2011, the Company had a valuation allowance against the full amount of any U.S. net deferred tax assets. The Company currently provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized.\n\n10. Litigation\n\nLitigation Relating to Initial Public Offering of Saba\n\nIn November 2001, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court) against the Company, certain of its officers and directors, and certain underwriters of the Companys initial public offering. The complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of a class of certain persons who purchased the Companys common stock between April 6, 2000 and December 6, 2000. The complaint alleges violations by the Company and its officers and directors of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and other related provisions in connection with certain alleged compensation arrangements entered into by the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering. An amended complaint was filed in April 2002. Similar complaints have been filed against hundreds of other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998. The complaints allege that the prospectus and the registration statement for the initial public offering failed to disclose that the underwriters allegedly solicited and received excessive commissions from investors and that some investors in the initial public offering agreed with the underwriters to buy additional shares in the aftermarket in order to inflate the price of the Companys stock. The complaints were later consolidated into a single action. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, attorney and expert fees, and other unspecified litigation costs.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nOn July 1, 2002, the underwriter defendants in the consolidated actions moved to dismiss all of the actions, including the action involving the Company. On July 15, 2002, the Company, along with other non-underwriter defendants in the coordinated cases, moved to dismiss the litigation. On February 19, 2003, the District Court ruled on the motions. The District Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss the claims against the Company under Rule 10b-5, due to the insufficiency of the allegations against the Company. The District Court also granted the motion of the individual defendants, Bobby Yazdani and Terry Carlitz, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and former Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Companys Board of Directors, to dismiss the claims against them under Rule 10b-5 and Section 20 of the Exchange Act. The motions to dismiss the claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act were denied as to virtually all of the defendants in the consolidated cases, including the Company.\n\nIn June 2003, a proposed collective partial settlement of this litigation was structured between the plaintiffs, the issuer defendants in the consolidated actions, the issuer officers and directors named as defendants, and the issuers insurance companies. In June 2004, an agreement of partial settlement was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval. The District Court granted the preliminary approval motion on February 15, 2005, subject to certain modifications. On August 31, 2005, the District Court issued a preliminary order further approving the modifications to the settlement and certifying the settlement classes. The District Court also appointed the notice administrator for the settlement and ordered that notice of the settlement be distributed to all settlement class members by January 15, 2006. The settlement fairness hearing occurred on April 24, 2006, and the court reserved decision at that time.\n\nWhile the partial settlement was pending approval, the plaintiffs continued to litigate against the underwriter defendants. The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of focus cases rather than in all of the 310 cases that have been consolidated. The Companys case is not one of these focus cases. On October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions. The underwriter defendants appealed that ruling, and on December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Courts class certification decision. On April 6, 2007, the Second Circuit denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing. In light of the Second Circuit opinion, counsel for the issuer defendants informed the District Court that this settlement could not be approved because the defined settlement class, like the litigation class, could not be certified. On June 25, 2007, the District Court entered an order terminating the settlement agreement. On August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed their second consolidated amended class action complaints against the focus cases and on September 27, 2007, again moved for class certification. On November 12, 2007, certain of the defendants in the focus cases moved to dismiss the second consolidated amended class action complaints. On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period. Briefing on the class certification motion was completed in May 2008. That motion was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement among the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The Court granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009. The settlement fairness hearing was held on September 10, 2009. On October 5, 2009, the Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the Court close these actions. Appeals of the opinion granting final approval were filed, all of which were disposed of except the appeals filed by one objector were remanded to the district court to determine standing to appeal. On August 25, 2011, the district court issued an order holding that the final objector had no standing to appeal. The objector has appealed that decision.\n\nThe Company intends to dispute these claims and defend the lawsuit vigorously. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the district courts August 25, 2011 order remains subject to appeal, the ultimate outcome of the litigation is uncertain. An unfavorable outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLitigation Relating to Centras Initial Public Offering\n\nCentra, certain of its former officers and directors and the managing underwriters of Centras initial public offering were named as defendants in an action filed in the District Court. The plaintiffs filed an initial complaint on December 6, 2001 and purported to serve the Centra defendants on or about March 18, 2002. The original complaint has been superseded by an amended complaint filed in April 2002. The action, captioned in re Centra Software, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 01 CV 10988, is purportedly brought on behalf of the class of persons who purchased Centras common stock between February 3, 2000 and December 6, 2000. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that, in connection with Centras initial public offering in February 2000, the underwriters received undisclosed commissions from certain\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\ninvestors in exchange for allocating shares to them and also agreed to allocate shares to certain customers in exchange for the agreement of those customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The complaint asserts that Centras registration statement and prospectus for the offering were materially false and misleading due to their failure to disclose these alleged arrangements. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount against Centra and the named individuals. Similar complaints have been filed against hundreds of other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998; the complaints have been consolidated into an action captioned in re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No. 21 MC 92.\n\nOn July 1, 2002, the underwriter defendants in the consolidated actions moved to dismiss all the actions, including the action involving Centra. On July 15, 2002, Centra, along with other non-underwriter defendants in the coordinated cases, moved to dismiss the litigation. On October 9, 2002, pursuant to agreements tolling the statute of limitations for claims related to the litigation, the plaintiffs dismissed, without prejudice, the claims against the named Centra officers and directors in the above-referenced action. Subsequent addenda to the agreements extended the tolling period through August 27, 2010. On February 19, 2003, the District Court issued an order denying the motion to dismiss the claims against Centra under Rule 10b-5. The motions to dismiss the claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act were denied as to virtually all of the defendants in the consolidated cases, including Centra.\n\nIn June 2003, a proposed collective partial settlement of this litigation was structured between the plaintiffs, the issuer defendants in the consolidated actions, the issuer officers and directors named as defendants, and the issuers insurance companies. In June 2004, an agreement of settlement was submitted to the District Court for preliminary approval. The District Court granted the preliminary approval motion on February 15, 2005, subject to certain modifications. On August 31, 2005 the District Court issued a preliminary order further approving the modifications to the settlement and certifying the settlement classes. The District Court also appointed the notice administrator for the settlement and ordered that notice of the settlement be distributed to all settlement class members by January 15, 2006. The settlement fairness hearing occurred on April 24, 2006, and the court reserved decision at that time.\n\nWhile the partial settlement was pending approval, the plaintiffs continued to litigate against the underwriter defendants. The District Court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of focus cases rather than in all of the 310 cases that have been consolidated. The Companys case is not one of these focus cases. On October 13, 2004, the District Court certified the focus cases as class actions.

On March 26, 2008, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss except as to Section 11 claims raised by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period. Briefing on the class certification motion was completed in May 2008. That motion was withdrawn without prejudice on October 10, 2008.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, a stipulation and agreement of settlement among the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and underwriter defendants was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The Court granted the plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval and preliminarily certified the settlement classes on June 10, 2009. The settlement fairness hearing was held on September 10, 2009. On October 5, 2009, the Court entered an opinion granting final approval to the settlement and directing that the Clerk of the Court close these actions. On August 26, 2010, based on the expiration of the tolling period stated in the agreements between the plaintiffs and the named Centra officers and directors, the plaintiffs filed a notice to terminate the tolling agreement and recommence litigation against the named Centra officers and directors. The plaintiffs stated to the Court that they do not intend to take any further action against the named Centra officers and directors at this time. Appeals of the opinion granting final approval were filed, all of which were disposed of except the appeals filed by one objector were remanded to the district court to determine standing to appeal. On August 25, 2011, the district court issued an order holding that the final objector had no standing to appeal. The objector has appealed that decision.\n\nThe Company, on behalf of Centra, intends to dispute these claims and defend the lawsuit vigorously. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the district courts August 25, 2011 order remains subject to appeal, the ultimate outcome of the litigation is uncertain. An unfavorable outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLitigation Relating to Claim of Patent Infringement by Centra\n\nOn August 19, 2003, a complaint was filed against Centra and two other defendants by EdiSync Systems, LLC, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (No. 03-D-1587 (OES)) (the Colorado District Court). The complaint alleges infringement of two patents for a remote multiple user editing system and method and seeks permanent injunctive relief against continuing infringement,\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\ncompensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and interest, costs and expenses associated with the litigation. Centra filed an answer to the complaint denying all of the allegations. No amount has been accrued related to this matter and legal costs incurred in the defense of the matter are being expensed as incurred. Centra filed a request for reexamination of the patents at issue with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the Patent Office). The Companys patent counsel is of the opinion that claims of the patents involved in the suit are invalid. The re-examination request was accepted by the Patent Office and the Colorado District Court approved the parties motion to stay the court proceedings during the re-examination proceedings. A reexamination certificate has been issued for one of the patents that canceled all of the patents claims, thereby rendering that patent of no further force or effect. The Patent Office issued a reexamination certificate for the other patent canceling all of the patents original claims and allowing certain newly-added claims.\n\nCentra subsequently filed a second reexamination request asking the Patent Office to reconsider the patentability of the newly-added claims in view of newly-discovered prior art and the Patent Office has granted that request. The Colorado District Court again stayed the litigation pending the outcome of the second reexamination proceeding. On August 9, 2011, the Patent Office issued a Notice of Intent to Issue a Reexamination Certificate, indicating that a second reexamination certificate would issue in view of certain claim amendments and arguments EdiSync made to the Patent Office. On August 19, 2011, the Colorado District Court lifted the second stay. The second reexamination certificate issued on October 4, 2011. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to any future claims and intends to vigorously defend this action. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation. An unfavorable outcome of the litigation could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n11. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts (Topic 350)IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASU 2010-28). ASU 2010-28 amends the criteria for performing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing Step 2 if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The Company will adopt ASU 2010-28 in fiscal 2013 and any impairment to be recorded upon adoption will be recognized as an adjustment to the Companys beginning retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-28 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS (ASU 2011-04), which provides guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The new standard does not extend the use of fair value but rather, provides guidance about how fair value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under U.S. GAAP. A public entity is required to apply the ASU prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05), to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income (loss) in financial statements. Under this ASU, an entity will have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements. The ASU eliminates the option in U.S. GAAP to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity. An entity should apply the ASU retrospectively. For a public entity, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of ASU 2011-05 beginning with its quarterly filing for the three months ending August 31, 2012. The adoption of this accounting update will have no impact on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350)Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011-08), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. ASU 2011-08 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2013 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011-08 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSABA SOFTWARE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Unaudited)\n\n12.

We enable organizations to build a transformative workplace where they can leverage their people networks to become more competitive through innovation, speed, agility, and trust.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Saba People Cloud consists of a full suite of integrated People Cloud Applications, an open, flexible, service-oriented architecture, a world-class multi-tenant people cloud infrastructure, and a vast people cloud community of human capital experts, partners, practitioners and thought leaders. The Saba People Cloud enables organizations to transform the way they develop, engage and inspire their people network of employees, partners and customers, to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and high impact performance. The Saba People Cloud does this by specifically providing solutions that help clients to:\n\nMOBILIZE THEIR PEOPLE NETWORK to seize new opportunities through complete talent visibility, mobility and connection. The Saba People Cloud provides organizations with visibility into all of the skills, experience, competencies and connections of the people in their people network, the ability to quickly align them to new business initiatives and inspire them to greatness.\n\nCULTIVATE A DEVELOPMENT CULTURE inside and outside their organization to arm their people network with the knowledge they need, when they need it to excel at their jobs, advance in their careers and drive higher performance.\n\nACCELERATE INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY by tapping into social and mobile capabilities to find and connect people and ideas throughout people networks to drive new ideas and faster time to market.\n\nLEVERAGE A UNIFIED, FLEXIBLE, MULTI-TENANT CLOUD architecture and infrastructure that reduces costs, shortens time to benefit and provides the flexibility to scale globally and adapt locally to fit any organizations unique operational and financial needs.\n\nEvolution of Our Market\n\nMost of todays human capital management systems were built to support historic learning and talent management processes and strategies, top down management, and a culture focused on operational efficiency and automation rather than the collaboration, innovation and creativity of the networked economy. Sequential steps that were consistent and repeatable, such as formal training and rigid performance reviews were the keys to successful execution. Many systems were built to support these processes on highly rigid, linear, transactional frameworks, making them poorly suited for dynamic people-focused strategies and a networked work style. Even newer software as a service (SaaS) based talent management systems are typically assembled through multiple acquisitions to support individual processes such as recruiting, performance management or learning, and because they are not organically built and unified they cannot provide the type of complete talent visibility and process unification required of todays human capital management systems.\n\nWhile business fundamentals have not changed, the environment in which organizations operate has changed dramatically and will continue to change at an accelerating pace. Business success now depends less on talented and knowledgeable individuals than on the power of the collective intelligence and influence of their personal and professional people networks. Much of this change is driven by technology such as the internet, mobile computing and the emergence of social networking technologies for business and commercial use. This continuous and dynamic change will continue to be highly disruptive to organizations that have not built a transformative workplace that is much more networked and agile. Organizations that have built this type of transformative workplace will be able to compete more effectively in the new networked economy, characterized by:\n\nWhile these trends are changing organizations from the outside, the workforce is simultaneously evolving to change organizations from the inside. Organizations are adopting a modern and networked way of working, where the norms are transparency, concurrent projects with real-time updates, and continuously connected people, including customers, contractors and partners, who can operate successfully in a fluid and fast changing environment.\n\nBackground\n\nWe commenced operations in April 1997 and, through March 1998, focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities, developing our products and building our business infrastructure. We shipped our first Saba Enterprise Learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees, implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in April 1998.\n\nIn fiscal 2011, we experienced an accelerated shift toward increased customer adoption of SaaS transactions from perpetual licenses. In recognition of this trend., we announced a strategy in July 2011 to offer new customers primarily cloud-based subscriptions to our\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nproducts, which we expect will further increase the shift in customer adoption of SaaS over perpetual licenses. Assuming this strategy is successful, we expect that the increased adoption of SaaS by our customers will lead to greater predictability in our quarterly revenue and our results of operations. However, the shift from software licenses has had an impact on our total revenue and results of operations during the last few quarters in part because we recognize revenues from SaaS over the term of the subscription agreement whereas revenue from a software license sale is generally recognized in the period in which the software arrangement is completed and the software is delivered to the customer.\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Redwood Shores, California. We have an international presence in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Morocco, Switzerland and the United Kingdom through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business. In each of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries, other than India, we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities. In the case of our India subsidiary, our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities.\n\nSources of Revenue\n\nWe generate revenues from the sale of subscription services, professional services and software licenses.\n\nSubscription Services\n\nSubscription revenue includes revenue from delivery of our products in the cloud and revenue from license updates and product support. Customers that desire to access our products in the cloud generally sign subscription agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years. License updates and product support include the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support. We typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license. After the initial period, license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer. Our subscription revenue depends upon both our sales of additional subscription services and renewals of existing agreements.\n\nWe believe that subscription revenue will grow steadily for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that the majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and we will continue to add new subscription customers.\n\nProfessional Services\n\nOur professional services business consists of consulting and education services. Consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that have purchased our products directly from us. These consulting and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after the product purchase. Accordingly, our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of new product bookings generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period. In addition, our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our license and SaaS customers may engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update. We provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and on a fixed fee basis. Generally, consulting services related to software implementation are not considered essential to the functionality of the software.\n\nSoftware Licenses\n\nAlthough we expect that our new customers will primarily purchase our products in the cloud on a software as a service basis, we will continue to license our products on a limited basis primarily to existing customers. When we license our software, it is included in multiple-element arrangement that includes a combination of our software, license updates and product support and/or professional services. A significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses. Our license revenue is affected by, among other things, the strength of general economic and business conditions, as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products. In addition, the sales cycle for our products is typically six to 12 months. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue.\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation, employee benefits and out-of-pocket travel-related expenses for our employees, and the fees of third-party subcontractors, who provide professional services. Cost of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges related to the infrastructure required to deliver our products in the cloud, third-party license royalty costs, overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses. The amortization of acquired developed technology, which is comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in acquisitions, is also included in the cost of revenue. Many factors affect our cost of revenue, including changes in the mix of products and services, pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses. Because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses, an increase in services, including subscription services, as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nFor contracts that were entered into prior to adoption of ASU 2009-13 and 2009-14, we classify deferred professional services revenue and the related deferred costs, when such services were related to subscription offerings, on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncurrent if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months. As of August 31, 2011, the deferred professional services and deferred costs balances were $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Deferred revenue and deferred costs related to contracts that were entered into prior to adoption of ASU 2009-13 and 2009-14 continue to be recognized and amortized ratably over the subscription period, provided that such contracts were not subsequently materially modified.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nWe classify all operating expenses, except amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring, to the research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses. Each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries (including stock-based compensation), employee benefits, travel and entertainment costs, and allocated communication, rent and depreciation costs. We allocate communication, rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts. The sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising, trade shows and marketing collateral materials. The general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts, and administrative and professional services fees.\n\nWe capitalize sales commissions related to non-cancellable annual or multi-year SaaS contracts and amortize the sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized over the non-cancellable term of the contract. All other sales commissions are generally expensed as they are earned per the terms of the sales compensations plans.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standard Codification (the Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. While a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affect our financial statements, areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, share-based payments, income taxes and business combinations. We have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nThe Company generates revenues from the sale of subscription services, professional services and software licenses and recognizes revenues when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\npersuasive evidence of an agreement exists;\n\n\n\ndelivery has occurred;\n\n\n\ncollection is probable.\n\nSubscription Services Arrangements\n\nSubscription services arrangements generally include a combination of our products delivered via an internet-based cloud architecture, product updates and support related to licenses and professional services. Subscription revenue includes revenue from cloud-based offerings and product updates and support related to licenses.\n\nRevenue from cloud-based offerings that are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access the Companys software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of the Companys software are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered or on an as-used basis if defined in the contract. Saba does not grant its resellers the right of return and does not recognize revenue from resellers until an end-user has been identified and the other conditions of software revenue recognition guidance are satisfied. Revenue from product updates, support and hosting services related to licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered or on an as-used basis if defined in the contract.\n\nWhen subscription services arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthe relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available; (ii) third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best estimate of selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\n\nThe Company determines VSOE based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, the Company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately.\n\nWhen VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, the Company applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, the Companys go-to-market strategy differs from that of its peers and its offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, the Company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the Company has not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\n\nWhen it is unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company determines BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices it charges for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices.\n\nThe Company has not historically priced its cloud-based offerings within a narrow range and limited historical renewal rate information is available based on the life cycle of these offerings. As a result, the Company uses BESP in order to allocate the selling price to cloud-based deliverables. In general, the Company uses VSOE in order to allocate the selling price to professional service deliverables.\n\nCertain cloud-based offerings include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of the Companys software. When these offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance.\n\nProfessional Services\n\nProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. Although the Company generally provides professional services on a time-and-materials basis, certain services agreements are provided on a fixed-fee basis. For services performed on a fixed-fee basis, revenues are generally recognized using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on hours of work performed. For contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software, the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method or, if Saba is unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services, Saba uses the completed-contract method of accounting in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance and relevant guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-35 Construction-Type and Certain ProductionType . A contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer.\n\nIf the requirements of software revenue recognition are not met when the Company bills a customer or a customer pays the Company, the billed or paid amount is recorded as deferred revenue, which is a liability account. As the revenue recognition criteria of software revenue recognition are satisfied, the requisite amounts are recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company classifies deferred revenue and deferred costs on its consolidated balance sheet as current if the Company expects to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months. When the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription for transactions entered into prior to adoption of Accounting Standards Updated 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) (ASU 2009-13), the Company allocates the revenue to professional services revenue and to subscription revenue based on the VSOE of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement. The Companys judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of the Companys revenue recognition and results of operations.\n\nSoftware License Arrangements\n\nSoftware license arrangements generally include a combination of the Companys software, license updates and product support and/or professional services. A significant amount of the Companys software license arrangements are for perpetual licenses.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue earned on perpetual software license arrangements in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance. When software arrangements involve multiple elements, the Company recognizes license revenue, using the residual method. Under the residual method revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amount of the arrangement is allocated to delivered elements. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nare met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method. The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately.\n\nLicense revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of ASC 985-605 are satisfied. License revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. In arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, The Company allocates the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the VSOE of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual licenses of similar products. The Company does not grant its resellers the right of return and does not recognize revenue from resellers until an end-user has been identified and the other conditions of software revenue recognition are satisfied.\n\nRecoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets\n\nWe account for goodwill under ASC 350-20 Goodwill. Our goodwill balance at August 31, 2011 was $41.4 million. We account for purchased intangible assets under ASC 350-30 General Intangibles Other than Goodwill. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, including acquired developed technology, was $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of August 31, 2011, our purchased intangible assets balance was $7.9 million, net of accumulated amortization. The total expected future amortization related to acquired intangible assets will be approximately $2.7 million for the year ended May 31, 2012 and $0.9 million for each of the years ended May 31, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\nASC 350-20 prescribes a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase requires us to test for impairment, while the second phase, if necessary, requires us to measure and allocate for the impairment. We consider Saba to be a single reporting unit. Accordingly, all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company. We perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment arise or circumstances otherwise dictate. A significant and extended reduction in our enterprise fair value to below the recorded amount of our stockholders equity could indicate a change in our business climate and under ASC 350-20, we could be required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and record an expense for an impairment loss.\n\nShare-based compensation\n\nUnder ASC 718-10 CompensationStock Compensation , we are required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and reduce share-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, forfeitures in the future may differ. The forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates. We recognize awards granted under the straight-line amortization method. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the stock option. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\n\nRSUs granted by the Board of Directors have been awarded under the Companys 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Stock Plan) and the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2009 Stock Plan). The RSUs generally vest in four annual installments commencing on the one year anniversary of the date of the award.\n\nASC 718-10 requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock-based award activity under ASC 718-10 to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities, rather than as a cash flow from operating activities.\n\nTo the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the three months ended August 31, 2011.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, segregating foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation, and determining required intercompany revenue sharing, cost reimbursement and other transfer pricing arrangements among related entities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and tax credit carryforwards. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. A portion of the valuation allowance pertains to deferred tax assets established in connection with prior acquisitions. The reversal of the valuation allowance pertaining to deferred tax assets established in connection with such prior acquisitions, would be credited to earnings. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. In the event that we were to determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be credited to earnings in the period in which we made such determination. If we later determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charges to earnings at such time.\n\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.\n\nUnder ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on a two-step approach. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on tax audit assuming that all issues are audited and resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes are considered. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of such matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, expiration of statutes of limitation on potential assessments or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets, to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable by us, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, therefore, actual results may differ from estimates. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe fair value of asset acquired and liabilities assumed are estimated using various valuation approaches, which include unobservable inputs that reflect our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value such assets and liabilities. Significant inputs to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, discount rates, probability of future cash pay-outs related to contingent consideration, and future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, acquired developed technologies and patents and brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio.\n\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2011 AND 2010\n\nRevenues\n\nThree months ended August 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenues 2010 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues:\n\nSubscription\n\n$ 18,547 61 % $ 14,895 55 %\n\nProfessional services\n\n9,329 30 % 7,849 29 %\n\nLicense\n\n2,765 9 % 4,450 16 %\n\nTotal revenues\n\n$ 30,641 100 % $ 27,194 100 %\n\nTotal Revenues.

Subscription revenue increased by $3.7 million (including $0.9 million for testing and assessment offerings as a result of our May 2011 acquisition of Comartis Group Ltd. (Comartis) and Pedagogue Solutions (Pedagogue)), or 25%, for the three months ended August 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase reflects an increase of subscription revenue from new customers, primarily related to our cloud offerings, as well as an increase in subscription revenue associated with subscription renewals.\n\nProfessional Services Revenue. Professional services revenue increased by $1.5 million (including $0.5 million for testing and assessment offerings), or 19%, for the three months ended August 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increased demand for our professional services from our expanded customer base.\n\nLicense Revenue. License revenue decreased by $1.7 million (including $0.2 million for testing and assessment offerings), or 38%, for the three months ended August 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The decrease in license revenue reflects the implementation of our strategy to primarily offer new cloud-based subscriptions to our products.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThree months ended August 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenues 2010 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenues\n\nCost of revenues\n\nSubscription\n\n$ 4,339 14 % $ 3,920 14 %\n\nProfessional services\n\n6,664 22 % 5,721 21 %\n\nLicense\n\n178 1 % 247 1 %\n\nAmortization of acquired developed technology\n\n75 0 % 295 1 %\n\nTotal cost of revenues\n\n$ 11,256 37 % $ 10,183 37 %\n\nThe following table is a summary of gross margin:\n\nThree months ended\n\nAugust 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010\n\nGross margin:\n\nSubscription\n\n$ 14,208 $ 10,975\n\nPercentage of subscription revenue\n\n77 % 74 %\n\nProfessional services\n\n2,665 2,128\n\nPercentage of professional services revenue\n\n29 % 27 %\n\nLicense (including amortization of acquired developed technology)\n\n2,512 3,908\n\nPercentage of license revenue\n\n91 % 88 %\n\nTotal\n\n$ 19,385 $ 17,011\n\nPercentage of total revenues\n\n63 % 63 %\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue increased by $0.4 million, or 11%, for the three months ended August 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase in cost of subscription revenue was primarily due to compensation costs of $0.2 million and external hosting costs of $0.2 million. Subscription gross margin increased to 77% for the three months ended August 31, 2011 from 74% for the three months ended August 31, 2010.\n\nCost of Professional Services Revenue. For the three months ended August 31, 2011, cost of professional services revenue increased by $0.9 million, or 17%, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010. The increase in cost of professional services revenue was primarily the result of an increase in compensation costs. The professional services gross margin increased slightly to 29% for the three months ended August 31, 2011, from 27% for the three months ended August 31, 2010.\n\nCost of License Revenue. Cost of license revenue decreased by $69,000, or 28%, for the three months ended August 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2010, due to an decrease in royalty expense. Gross margin on license revenue increased to 91% for the three months ended August 31, 2011 from 88% for the three months ended August 31, 2010.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nThree months ended August 31, 2011 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenue 2010 Percent\n\nof Total\n\nRevenue (dollars in thousands)\n\nOperating expenses:\n\nResearch and development\n\n$ 6,052 20 % $ 4,423 16 %\n\nSales and marketing\n\n13,096 43 % 9,846 36 %\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n4,938 16 % 3,412 13 %\n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n\n743 2 % 634 2 %\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$ 24,829 81 % $ 18,315 67 %\n\nResearch and development.
