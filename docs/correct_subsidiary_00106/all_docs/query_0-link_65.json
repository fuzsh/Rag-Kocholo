        "text": "CommOn (competency management through ontologies) is a framework which aims at developing operational knowledge-based systems dedicated to the management of competencies. Such a competency-based system can be used for different purposes such as staff development and deployment, job analysis or economic evaluation. CommOn is based on two models (implemented with specific tools) which guide (i) the building of competency reference systems related to particular domains such as healthcare or information and telecommunication, (ii) the identification and the formal representation of competency profiles and (iii) the matching of competency profiles. Developed in the context of semantic Web technology, the CommOn framework allows one to build shareable ontologies and knowledge bases represented with semantic Web languages and to develop competency-based Web services dedicated to human resource management. The use of CommOn is illustrated in the context of a project (related to e-recruitment) which aims at developing the first Macedonian Web-based platform dedicated to the definition of an efficient networking of employment and training operators\n\nPurpose–The purpose of this paper is to present a prototype ontology-based application that has been developed for competency management and learning paths. Design/methodology/approach–The paper provides an overview of competency management and related work in this area, a description of the competency ontology, and a functional and architectural analysis.\n\nIn the era of digital technology, it is easy to find information in order to develop ASN self-competence. Classical training and learning have begun to shift towards digital forms to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, digital learning will make government agencies compete to create their own systems but may cause inefficiencies. The integration of a learning management system is important to implement. In 2021, LAN developed a learning management system that can facilitate and integrate existing systems. This system is an innovative new LAN method to develop ASN competence in a digital learning platform called Multitenance ASN Unggul. This research aimed to examine how to realize and manage this Multi-tenance ASN Unggul platform, and the progress of its system development. Qualitative methods were used. It was found that this platform can facilitate ASN learning through micro-learning; it allows training institutions to create and integrate learning management syste...\n\nThe expansion of computer networks has at the same time given impetus to the distance learning environments. E-learning systems are also advanced and more efficient. However, these platforms offer such complex teaching functionalities that designers find themselves poorly equipped to succeed in their engineering processes. This article presents a tool that makes it easier for designers to produce educational content according to the Competency-Based Approach (CBA). We propose an implementation of the CBA after its modeling via ontology. Our module can be grafted to any author system oriented pedagogy based skills. We have advocated for Service for Oriented Architecture as a software solution to model our business process that consists of a set of interconnected services that are modeled and implemented. The proposed system is the result of a coordina-tion of, services, incorporating the order of competences explained by a distance education, which integrates and interacts according ..."
