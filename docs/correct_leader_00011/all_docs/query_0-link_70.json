        "text": "Following the previous (1995) general elections, a five-party \"rainbow\" coalition led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) had come to power, with 145 of the 200 parliamentary seats. In ideological terms, this alliance ranged from ex-communist and ecological parties to conservatives.\n\nIn the four intervening years, the Government headed by Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen (SDP) had succeeded in improving the country's economy through, inter alia, tough reforms to pave the way for Finland's entry into the European economic and monetary union. This performance resulted in the economy becoming a virtual non-topic during the somewhat moribund campaign, although there were differences on tax and labor market policies. Debate was similarly lacking in foreign affairs issues such as NATO membership and relations with the Russian Federation, as the leaders of the three major parties - Prime Minister Lipponen, Mr. Esko Aho of the main opposition Center Party (KESK) and Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto of the conservative National Coalition Party (KOK) adhered to an unwritten non-aggression pact. Nearly 2000 candidates were in contention.\n\nOn polling day, the SDP clung to its leading parliamentary position although losing 12 seats, which analysts attributed primarily to a cronyism scandal in the party and public resentment of its radical economic reforms. On the other hand, both KESK and KOK recorded impressive gains to stay at the heels of the Social Democrats. The Conservatives - whose platform advocated cutting taxes, trimming government spending and boosting flexibility in the labour market, and who projected a pro-European, modern image - picked up the most additional seats (7). Altogether 10 of the 13 parties in the running gained representation.\n\nAfter the elections, Mr. Lipponen was the first to try to form a new government. After hearing the political plans of the various parties, he announced that he would try to form a government with the same partners as the previous one (SDP, KOK, the Left-Wing Alliance (VL), the Greens and the Swedish People's Party (SFP). This was done on 13 April."
