        "text": "His comments were a rebuff to an idea put forward earlier by the Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb, who had suggested extra power be granted to eurozone nations with the highest credit ratings.\n\nPaavo Lipponen said two years ago the presidency did not interest him. However changes in the world, especially the economic crisis and tougher attitudes on the home front had changed his mind. The former SDP Chairman added he could not stand idly by while democracy was ridiculed and while minorities were attacked.\n\nDefending democracy essential\n\n“It was essential to show that the majority of Finns did not accept extreme views. Defending parliamentary democracy is a linchpin of my candidacy,” Lipponen stated.\n\nIf elected to the presidency, Lipponen said he would support both parliament and the government. Although the president had power to influence, the correct formula had to be found.\n\n“The President has no need to emphasize the position of the office. Directing foreign policy requires so much effort that there was no need to be on a collision course with the government or parliament,” Lipponen stressed.\n\nA more united EU\n\nAlthough many had cooled towards the eurozone and greater co-operation within the EU, Lipponen said he took a different direction: the union should be strengthened. But he told the Ykkösaamu programme that this meant greater discipline and common action. Only this would prevent member states from falling into greater debt.\n\nHe trusted the European Central Bank as a final guarantor but in the end each indebted member state must take responsibility for its own actions.\n\n”Europe is at the crossroads. The actions of Germany are of particular significance. The country guards its euros carefully, yet it is not afraid to take responsibility. Now was not the time to show some member states the door,” Lipponen noted.\n\nTurning to possible Finnish membership of NATO, Lipponen said he concurred with the government’s line on the issue. He emphasized he had never proposed Finnish membership of the military alliance. “Neutrality is a precious thing,” he observed."
