        "text": "Tallinn, Stenbock House 27 January 2004 Today in Helsinki, Prime Minister Juhan Parts met with Finnish President Tarja Halonen and Speaker of the Finnish Parliament Paavo Lipponen. As the meetings mainly focused on EU issues because of Estonia´s forthcoming accession, the Finnish president introduced Finland´s experience as an EU Member State immediately after accession. The prime minister stressed that an exchange of information and experience on various levels between Estonia and Finland is very important in the EU context. Among other things, the Finnish president praised Estonia´s good reputation and starting position in the EU. The meetings with the president and the speaker of parliament both discussed the relations between the EU and Russia. All of the parties confirmed having similar positions on these issues. Parts stressed the special importance of the EU speaking as a single voice and acting as a single force in its Russian policy. Developments within the EU and the potential formation of an EU core were discussed with the Finnish Parliament speaker. According to the prime minister, Europe´s strength lies in the unity of its differences. \"Twenty-five states have worked in the name of enlargement for ten years. Now this common victory should be transformed into the growing welfare of all the citizens,\" the Estonian prime minister stated. \"Ideas about a core Europe and a two-speed Europe are working against a strong Europe,\" he added. Lipponen gave an overview of Finland´s security policy debate in the Finnish Parliament. The Parliament will discuss the defence and security policy report this autumn. Lipponen and Parts also spoke about Georgia, and stated that the EU should regard Georgia as a European state and extend all-round assistance to the country. Parts introduced the Estonian Government´s initiative to develop Georgia. At the end of the visit, the prime minister visited the Finnish National Technology Agency Tekes and the Innopol high-tech centre. Government Press Office Phone 693 5706, 693 5792"
