It was a majority government, and one of the longest-running governments in Finnish history. Lipponen's first government ran for a whole term of a Finnish cabinet, or 1 464 days in total. The cabinet was composed of a coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party, the National Coalition Party, the Swedish People's Party, the Left Alliance, and the Green League. Due to the cabinet containing five separate parties from all over Finland's political spectrum, both of Lipponen's cabinets were considered rainbow coalitions (Finnish: sateenkaarihallitukset).\n\nMinisters[edit]\n\nPortfolio Minister Took office Left office Party Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Social Democratic Party Deputy Prime Minister Sauli Niinistö April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister for Foreign Affairs Tarja Halonen April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Social Democratic Party Minister of Justice Sauli Niinistö April 13, 1995 February 2, 1996 National Coalition Party Kari Häkämies February 2, 1996 March 13, 1998 National Coalition Party Jussi Järventaus March 13, 1998 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister of the Interior Jan-Erik Enestam April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Swedish People's Party Minister of Defence Anneli Taina April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister of Finance Iiro Viinanen April 13, 1995 February 2, 1996 National Coalition Party Sauli Niinistö February 2, 1996 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister of Education Olli-Pekka Heinonen April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kalevi Hemilä April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Independent Minister of Transport Tuula Linnainmaa April 13, 1995 April 1, 1997 National Coalition Party Matti Aura April 2, 1997 January 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Kimmo Sasi January 15, 1999 April 15, 1999 National Coalition Party Minister of Trade and Industry Antti Kalliomäki April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Social Democratic Party Minister of Social Affairs and Health Sinikka Mönkäre April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Social Democratic Party Minister of Labour Liisa Jaakonsaari April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Social Democratic Party Minister of the Environment Pekka Haavisto April 13, 1995 April 15, 1999 Green League\n\nPreceded by Cabinet of Finland\n\nApril 13, 1995 - April 15, 1999 Succeeded by\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nPaavo Lipponen's second Cabinet"
