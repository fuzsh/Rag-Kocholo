        "text": "One Finnish newspaper even suggested last week that, in the next cabinet list, there would be “little demand for persons who are ignorant of EU affairs or unable to communicate in any language save their own”.\n\nIn contrast to Germany’s stewardship of the Union, which culminated in last week’s departure of Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine less than two weeks before a summit to agree the EU’s new 2000-06 spending plans, the Finns want to be seen as competent business managers.\n\nThe usually protracted talks between the parties to put together a coalition will almost certainly be curtailed so that the new government is ready to take on the presidency on 1 July.\n\nThe latest polls suggest Social Democrat Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen should hang on to office. A survey published last week showed his party nosing ahead on 23%, with the Centre Party of former Premier Eko Aho just behind on 22% and the Conservatives, led by Finance Minister Sauli Niinistö, on 21%. However, a poll by Finnish Gallup revealed 31% of voters would opt for Niinistö as premier and only 21% for Lipponen.\n\nThere are few key policy differences between the two, and the Conservatives and the Social Democrats have already agreed their general approach to the EU presidency. They have even laid contingency plans in case the Agenda 2000 budgetary talks fail at next week’s Berlin summit. “If we inherit Agenda 2000, it will go to the Tampere summit,” said a senior Finnish official, referring to the meeting planned for mid-October to discuss justice and home affairs issues.\n\nMinisters also agreed to lay the groundwork for the next treaty reform conference which could get under way under the Portuguese presidency next year.\n\nIn the eye of the financial storm\n\nTim Jones recalls the launch of European Voice and how it was received in Brussels.\n\nPhil Hogan – farm fixer\n\nProfile of the European commissioner for agriculture and rural development\n\nJonathan Hill – charming consensus-builder\n\nProfile of the European commissioner for financial stability, financial services and capital-markets union.\n\nDanièle Nouy – Ideal candidate\n\nProfile of the chair of the supervisory board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism"
