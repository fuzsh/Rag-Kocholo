        "text": "Arctic Biodiversity Congress 2018, plenary speakers\n\nSeveral speakers will address the Arctic Biodiversity Congress plenary. Plenary sessions will be live-streamed from the Tievo plenary hall to neighbouring Kero and Valtuustostali in City Hall.\n\nLivđe in the landscape\n\nAnna Morottaja, performing artist\n\nAnna Morottaja is an Inari Sámi musician, from Northern Finland where she lives in her childhood home near lake Muddusjärvi in which she fishes all year round. Traditional Inari Sámi music, livđe, is close to her heart and Anna is also a master of the northern Sámi joik. Livđe and joik are integral parts of her everyday life. Anna is known for the broad range of her voice and has taught livđe at kindergartens and schools.\n\nIn her performance Anna evokes the world through Inari Sámi livđe and illustrates it using the photography of Rauno Koivunen. The themes of livđe are connected to birds which provide their own tone to the seasons while the photos of Rauno describe the changing seasons in the North.\n\nRauno Koivunen has photographed nature in Lappi for several years especially lake Muddusjärvi during the changing seasons. Rauno comes from Ähtäri, Mid-Finland and became interested in nature when he moved to Inari in 2011. He is especially interested in capturing the tones of different seasons and in close-up photos of flora and fauna.\n\nInari Sámi is one of nine Sami languages and is spoken only in the Inari region, in northern Finland. Inari Sámi is spoken by 400 people and due to a successful revitalization work amongst kindergarten children and adults, is flourishing today. People are the main theme of livđe but birds, fish and other animals are also reflected. Livđe was almost lost to history due to the pressures of the modern world but was thankfully rescued through the work of artists such as Anna is becoming a part of everyday life in the Inari Sámi region.\n\nOpening words\n\nSauli Niinistö, President of the Republic of Finland\n\nRead the opening remarks of the President of the Republic of Finland Sauli Niinistö during the opening of the Arctic BIodiversity Congress, 2018ö during the opening of the Arctic BIodiversity Congress, 2018\n\nPresident of the Republic of Finland Sauli Väinämö Niinistö, the 12th President of the Republic of Finland, was inaugurated on 1 March 2012 and re-elected in January 2018.

Zimov, director of the Northeast Science Station in Cherskii in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), received his academic training in geophysics at the Far East State University in Vladivostok, Russia. He subsequently did fieldwork in northern Siberia for the Pacific Institute for Geography, part of the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1980, he organized the science station that he now directs.\n\nResearch at the center includes studies of global carbon and methane budgets and animal extinctions that occurred in Siberia when the Pleistocene epoch gave way to the ongoing Holocene about 10,000 years ago.\n\nIn 1989, Zimov initiated a long-term project known as “Pleistocene Park,” which he now is pursuing with a number of partners. The goal of the project is to reconstitute the long-gone ecosystem of the Pleistocene epoch that supported vast populations of large animals including mammoths, horses, reindeer, bison, wolves, and other large predators. If the effort succeeds in the park, Zimov and his co-workers would like to see the ecosystem restored over much larger areas in an effort to stave off what otherwise could be a massive release of carbon that now is sequestered in the permafrost but that could be released into the atmosphere as global temperatures rise. His hunting of mammoth remains in the tundra and his bold vision of controlling and restoring ecosystems have earned him coverage in books, documentaries, and other media.\n\nLearn more about Sergei's work at Pleistocene Park.\n\nIndigenous peoples, biodiversity, and their interrelated nature\n\nDalee Sambo Dorough, Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council\n\nRead the full text of Dalee Sambo Dorough's keynote speech to the Arctic Biodiversity Congress.\n\nDr. Dalee Sambo Dorough was elected as Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council in June 2018.\n\nFounded in 1977 by the late Eben Hopson of Barrow, Alaska, the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) has flourished and grown into a major international non-government organization representing approximately 160,000 Inuit of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka (Russia). The organization holds Consultative Status II at the United Nations.\n\nTo thrive in their circumpolar homeland, Inuit had the vision to realize they must speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way of life. The principal goals of ICC are, therefore, to strengthen unity among Inuit of the circumpolar region; promote Inuit rights and interests on an international level; develop and encourage long-term policies that safeguard the Arctic environment; and seek full and active partnership in the political, economic, and social development of circumpolar regions.\n\nDr. Sambo Dorough is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at University of Alaska Anchorage; Alaska Member of the Inuit Circumpolar Council Advisory Committee on UN Issues; Member of the Board of Trustees of UN Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations; and Member of the International Law Association Committee on Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nDr. Dorough has a long history of direct involvement in the discussion, debate, and negotiation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). She was an active participant in this work from 1985 up to adoption of the UNDRIP by the UN General Assembly on September 13, 2007.\n\nShe specializes in public international law, international human rights law, international relations, and Alaska Native self-determination. In addition, she has experience in the administration, management and coordination of statewide, national and international organizations as well as estimating and oversight of federal, state and private construction contracts.\n\nFor more information please visit Inuit Circumpolar Council Alaska, Canada, Greenland.\n\nParameters for responsible investments in the Arctic\n\nTero Kiviniemi, Chair of the Arctic Economic Council Investments and Infrastructure Working Group\n\nThe Arctic Economic Council (AEC) aims to facilitate business activities and responsible resource development throughout the circumpolar Arctic. The AEC will do this through the sharing of best practices, technological solutions, standards, and other information. The AEC’s Working Groups reflect the AEC selected business areas. Currently, the AEC has five Working Groups: Maritime Transportation, Responsible Resource Development, Connectivity, Investments & Infrastructure, and Energy.\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Arctic Global Agenda Council published an Arctic Investment Protocol (AIP) with an intention to start a discussion and build a coalition around responsible investment in the Arctic. While the World Economic Forum’s Arctic Global Agenda Council ceased to exist in 2016, the Forum wanted to see the work on the AIP taken forward. The AEC decided to endorse the intent of the AIP at its Annual Meeting in 2017, and the AIP was transferred to the AEC later the same year. The role of the AEC includes continuing to build a coalition of support around the principles laid out in the AIP.\n\nThe AEC Working Group on Investments & Infrastructure (IIWG) will focus its work on the principles related to responsible investments in the Arctic. This work will build upon the foundation of the AIP.\n\nKiviniemi is President and CEO of Destia Group Plc and chair and member of its management team.
