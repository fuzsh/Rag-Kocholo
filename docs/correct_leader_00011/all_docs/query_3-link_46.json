        "text": "Paavo Lipponen is a man for our times. So says Cherie Booth, applauding the prime minister of Finland for handing the top job over to his finance minister and taking a week off last month after the birth of his second daughter.\n\nLipponen took parental leave for both births, Booth pointed out. \"I, for one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example,\" she said. \"It is time that men started to challenge the assumptions in the workplace that the nurturing of children has nothing to do with them. Our children need their male role models as well as their female ones.\"\n\nAll eyes are now on Tony Blair. Will he let Gordon Brown take over while he immerses himself in the family after the birth of his fourth child in May?\n\n\"What Tony Blair does when this baby is born will be a very powerful signal to other men about what real men do,\" said Mary Newburn of the National Childbirth Trust. \"If he is not seen to take time off that will be quite damaging because it is difficult for men to prioritise their families and it is crucial that they should be able to be involved in sharing responsibility and caring for their children.\"\n\nWhile signals and role models are all-important to cultural change, they do little to help the cash-strapped average working father because the parental leave provisions that the UK has finally brought in, now that we are signed up to the social chapter of the EU, give men the right to time off but only without pay. The new provisions apply equally to men and women, who can add the unpaid leave to maternity leave (18 weeks of which is paid). There are no retrospective rights. Parents - including adoptive parents - are entitled to take a total of 13 weeks off unpaid during the first five years of life of any baby born or adopted after 15 December last year.\n\nThis brings us into line with the rest of the continent, but many European countries have already gone further and introduced an element of pay. In Italy, a mother or father gets 30% of earnings for up to six months leave. German men can have up to three years off at 600DM (£190)a month on a mean-tested basis. Belgium subsidises career breaks at £250 a month for up to five years.\n\nThe Nordic countries are already so far ahead that Britain is unlikely ever to catch up. Swedish parents each have a right to a year's paid leave and 78% of men take it. Norwegians get full wages for 42 weeks which can be shared, although fathers have a ring-fenced four weeks to themselves. Finland and Denmark also have generous arrangements, although Lipponen's gesture was partly intended to boost the male take-up, which is only about 2%.\n\nIn the UK, there is a further, crucial, hitch. Only men and women who have been employed for a year can take parental leave; workers on contract have no such entitlement. In fact, unless the prime minister's contract says so, he probably isn't entitled to leave either.\n\nThere has already been a shift in male perceptions of their roles in childcare to judge by attendance levels in the delivery room. According to the Maternity Alliance, more than 90% share the experience of childbirth, and employers rarely object now. However, men take the time from holiday entitlement, usually spending a few days at home afterwards. The government does not expect more than 2% of men to take up paternity leave - but 35% of women will. The change in the law is not a great advance.\n\nTo make a real difference, Cherie Booth should lean on her husband to take a week off every year until their child is five. But Tony Blair is not the unconventional Paavo Lipponen: the 58-year-old Finnish PM courted disapproval in his own country by living with his 32-year-old partner - both were divorced and had children already - and marrying only when a baby was on the way. She is Paivi Hertzberg, a history teacher.\n\nBy taking paternity leave, Lipponen sent an important message to his fellow countryment: no one, not even a prime minister, is indispensable at work. That may not be a position Tony Blair will want to endorse.\n\nBonding with baby: Do men need or want time off?\n\nJohn Humphrys, broadcaster and expectant father\n\n\"I'm not having any. I can't see the point. I'm not the one having the baby. If I were, then I'd want maternity leave, but I'm not. I'm freelance anyway, but even if I were able to take it I doubt that I would.\"\n\nJohn Brown, John Brown Publishing\n\n\"We give parental leave to everybody, but in my experience - personal and as an employer - a lot of people want an excuse to come back to work quickly. I think it's right to take a few days, but, especially with the first child, you come back to the office for some peace and quiet. Of course, men should have some time off.\"\n\nAllon Reich, head of film, Miramax Films UK. Two children, aged two and four\n\n\"I took roughly two weeks when my children were born and there was no sense of it being frowned upon, in fact the Weinstein brothers [his employers] sent me a hamper from Harrods when my latest was born. I had a paternity leave clause written into my contract at Miramax.\"\n\nJohn Griffiths, managing director of the billion-dollar Intershop. Three children aged ten, eight, five\n\n\"I didn't take paternity leave. I couldn't afford to. We were all on crazy working hours then and taking more than your standard two weeks a year would have been frowned upon. If I had a fourth child, I would take leave. It is more socially acceptable now. Besides, it is my company and I can do what I like.\"\n\nRowley Leigh, chef at Kensington Place, London. Two children, aged fourteen, eleven and two\n\n\"Most men do try to take a week off but it's always at the wrong time: the baby's always early or late. Most men take it as holiday; we don't give leave and I don't think it should be statutory. I took a week for my youngest, but I had a lot of staff to cover for me. In this job, it's not easy.\"\n\nAndrew Robertson, chief executive, Abbot Mead Vickers advertising agency. Three children, aged eleven, eight, seven\n\n\"I took paternity leave each time - not longer than a week, but more than a few days. We encourage it for women and men and it is certainly not to be frowned upon. We generally find men will not take their full entitlement, but most will take some sort of leave.\""
