        "text": "Page 151 →Six Loyal to Whom? Finland’s Decision to Join the Eurozone\n\nIn the previous two chapters, I demonstrated how minority and minimum-winning coalitions could make foreign policy commitments even though the odds were seemingly stacked against them. In Denmark, the two minority coalitions were structurally vulnerable in the parliament, yet they were able to commit their country to the military operations in Iraq both in 1990 and then in 2003. How? Because they were able to either ideologically divide the parliamentary opposition, or, when such fragmentation was not possible, they were able to logroll with it. In the Netherlands, as the decision to join the 2003 Iraq war spilled over across multiple coalitional arrangements, the ideological distance and policy difference between the parties posed an obstacle. Yet the Dutch ultimately committed to the war effort as the reluctant coalition partners ended up lending their support to it in exchange for office seats.\n\nAs I theorized in chapter 2 and quantitatively demonstrated in chapter 3, not all coalitions face these kinds of impediments. Surplus majority (oversized) coalitions, in particular, do not suffer from the structural constraints that minority coalitions do in the parliament since they enjoy a substantial and comfortable majority of seats. Similarly, oversized coalitions are not as hard-pressed by the “junior partner” veto as are minimum-winning coalitions precisely because they include more parties than they need to maintain their parliamentary majority. In effect, veto power is distributed unevenly in oversized coalitions, where “surplus” junior parties Page 152 →lack the “blackmail potential”459 that all junior parties otherwise have in minimum-winning contexts. If these surplus parties disagree with the government’s policy, there is not much that they can do to change its course.\n\nIn the absence of such structural constraints, the foreign policy pursuits of oversized coalitions are influenced by another mechanism instead, namely, responsibility diffusion. These governments can better circumvent electoral accountability due to their size and can impede the voters’ ability to identify whom to blame for unpopular foreign policy behavior when it is time for re-election. If diffusion works, these parties should barely lose voter support in subsequent elections. Anticipating that they will retain votes regardless of these unpopular policies, parties in oversized coalitions might therefore choose to remain loyal to the other governing parties instead of to their constituents. This way, parties maintain their role as credible coalition partners and maximize their chances of joining possible future governments. To demonstrate how these dynamics take place, I turn to Finland’s decision to adopt the European Union’s common currency by joining the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).\n\nSome readers might question my case selection in this chapter, asking if I am comparing apples to oranges: why do I shift the policy domain from security (chapters 4 and 5) to political economy, and what value does this shift add to my theoretical argument? This is a fair question that deserves a discussion.\n\nFirst, the EMU decision constitutes yet another “hard test” of my theory, demonstrating its robustness. In chapters 4 and 5, I argued that the dynamics of coalition politics shaped foreign policy making and the strength of the Danish and Dutch commitments abroad even when the issues at hand (security, international threats, and alliance relationships, particularly with the United States) were the types of issues where we often expect domestic political factors to take a back seat. Importantly, the role of public opinion remained muted both in the Danish and Dutch decisions to join the 2003 Iraq war as well as in the Danish decision to contribute to the 1990 Iraq war, either because public opinion was fluctuating (e.g., Denmark in 1990), divided (e.g., Denmark in 2003), or because it was used strategically by politicians to justify their actions (e.g., Netherlands in 2003). The absence of public pressure during these episodes would remind some readers of the notion that security and defense issues are of “second-order” and less worthy of the public’s scrutiny, therefore less consequential Page 153 →for policy as well as for the electoral prospects of incumbents. Politicians perhaps do “waltz before a blind audience” when it comes to these issues.460\n\nIf this is a plausible explanation for the muted effect of public opinion on security and defense, then a robust test of the responsibility diffusion hypothesis requires an issue area where public opinion is far more salient and powerful. After all, the ability of surplus majority coalitions to evade negative public opinion is precisely the mechanism that undergirds the diffusion thesis to explain their international commitments. Therefore, explaining the commitment behavior of surplus coalitions on a foreign economic issue such as the EMU should be a much harder test of the diffusion hypothesis. If I can demonstrate that the EMU decision moved forward because of the nature of surplus coalition dynamics in Finland even though it was a highly salient issue of foreign economic policy that received major public backlash, this should provide stronger support for my argument. If the surplus majority coalition in Finland was able to diffuse responsibility and circumvent electoral backlash for a key commitment such as joining the EMU, then these types of coalitions should have a much easier time diffusing responsibility and engaging in international commitments concerning second-order issues of security and defense.\n\nSecond, the events dataset that I utilized in chapter 3 already includes events pertaining to the economic relationships between states themselves as well as between states and international organizations. The target sectors of nearly 15 percent of the foreign events in my dataset are recorded as businesses, markets, monetary units, and the like, indicating that economic issues were among the tally of international interactions, as they should be. Therefore, it is befitting to demonstrate qualitatively that coalition governance similarly shapes the foreign policy of economic relationships, not just security and defense. In other words, I am not shifting the domain per se, but rather holding a bigger flashlight toward foreign policy to reveal its breadth and diversity beyond security and defense.\n\nThe EMU decision was a major international commitment for Finland for two reasons. First, joining the EMU would mean replacing the Finnish markka with the common European currency—the euro—as well as integrating Finland’s monetary policy to the European Union’s. Second, the EMU decision quickly became a sign of the country’s commitment to the EU itself. Finland’s then prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, transformed the EMU decision into a broader debate concerning Finland’s membership in the EU. He swiftly raised the stakes by arguing that if Finland stayed Page 154 →out of the EMU, it might consider leaving the EU altogether “even if this meant decoupling Finland’s fate from that of its closest partner within the EU, Sweden.”461 In a subsequent interview, Lipponen stated that this was “a foreign policy issue,” which “in many respects . . . link economic and political issues in a totally new way.”462 As a result, the EMU decision was framed and understood as a major foreign policy commitment for this country.\n\nFinland also provides an excellent setting to study the foreign policy behavior of oversized coalitions. Since the country’s independence in 1917, no single party has been able to assume a parliamentary majority.463 Instead, Finland has been governed by majority coalition governments since the 1970s464 and by surplus majority coalitions since 1987,465 suggesting that this coalition type is not at all an exception in Finnish politics.466 Furthermore, the 1990s mark a period of visible transformation of the political system in Finland from semipresidentialism to parliamentarism. As I explain below, the supremacy of the president in foreign policy had not only weakened substantially throughout the 1990s but was replaced entirely with the parliamentary government, especially in EU matters. This institutional transformation was finally codified into the country’s new constitution in 2000. It is against this backdrop that the EMU decision took place. In 1998, despite the strong and consistent public opposition among the Finns against joining the European Union’s common currency zone, the five-party oversized coalition led by Paavo Lipponen not only went ahead with the proposal and secured parliamentary approval but also got re-elected a year later to serve for another full term, until 2003. How was that possible?\n\nIn answering this question, this chapter diverges from the previous two chapters in a number of ways, but at the same time it complements and strengthens the book’s coalition politics framework to explain foreign policy commitments. First, as I have discussed earlier, Finland’s EMU membership decision does not belong to the conventional security and defense policy domain, but in illustrating how coalition politics influence foreign economic policy, the case expands the applicability of the theoreticalPage 155 → framework to other, more diverse areas of foreign affairs. For this reason, security-related and geopolitical considerations do not receive as much emphasis in this chapter as they did in the previous two chapters.\n\nSecond and relatedly, I pay far more attention to the role of public opinion and electoral behavior in foreign policy commitments in this chapter than I did in chapters 4 and 5. The diffusion explanation for oversized coalitions rests fundamentally on the government’s ability to pursue unpopular policies and still get re-elected; therefore, I must highlight specifically the relationship between the governing parties and voters in Finland in the context of the EMU decision not as an alternative explanation, but as a key observable that helps demonstrate my main explanation. Still, in addition to focusing more carefully on the role of public opinion, I continue to investigate the effects of other alternative explanations including political leadership, logrolling, and the EU’s legal framework in the run-up to the EMU decision.\n\nTo do so, I utilize the Economist Intelligence Unit’s monthly country reports to track the domestic political debates surrounding the EMU decision as well as the changes in public opinion. I also rely on the Archive and Chronology of Finnish Foreign Policy (EILEN) of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs to capture what took place in Finnish domestic and foreign policy at the time. Funded by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among others, EILEN includes archival material on Finnish foreign policy as well as the detailed chronologies of foreign policy developments since 1973. I complement these sources with the academic literature on Finnish domestic and foreign policy, as well as analyses of the country’s relations with the EU and EMU. In the remainder of the chapter, I provide an overview of Finland’s domestic political system and foreign policy. Next, I present the political debate around the EMU as I analyze the government’s decision to join the eurozone in the face of public opposition.\n\nParliamentarizing the System: Domestic Politics in Finland\n\n471 Indeed, this echoes the “fragmented opposition” hypothesis introduced in chapter 2.472\n\nIn addition to these three parties, the left-wing Left Alliance (VAS), the center-left Green League Party (VIHR), and the right-wing Swedish People’s Party (RKP) often gain seats in the Finnish parliament, the Eduskunta. The VAS had been particularly successful in the period that I focus on, as it gained a seat in the government for the first time in 1995 and remained there for two full consecutive terms until 2003. The RKP, representing Finland’s Swedish-speaking population, has been a governing party since 1979.473 Along with the Christian League, these four minor parties often gain between 4 to 11 percent of the total national vote and have consistently participated in the parliament since the 1980s.474\n\nBroad coalitions are considered the name of the game in this country given its fragmented political system.475 Although parliamentary seats are allocated to parties based on their vote shares, the Finnish electoral system is candidate-centered, in that the voters can vote for individual candidates on party lists.476 That being said, Finnish parties enjoy high levels of cohesion among their cabinet and parliamentary groups, which “effectively prevent any disagreements” inside them.477 Observed in the run-up to the Page 157 →EMU decision as well as elsewhere, the party leadership sets the tone for the party and “can wield considerable influence among the rank and file, persuading them to follow the elite opinion.”478 Intraparty factionalism is thus curtailed through discipline across the ranks, as I show later on, which allows me to focus on the behavior of the parties as unitary actors instead of the specific factions inside them. In addition to the presence of broad surplus coalitions, the candidate-centeredness of the electoral process further dilutes voter accountability at the party level.479\n\nWhat role does the parliamentary government play in Finnish politics? Finland’s political system had been dominated by the president and was considered semipresidential up until the 1990s. By the early 1990s, the balance of power began to change in favor of the government and accelerated especially with the country’s membership in the European Union. Prior to the 1990s, the president could appoint the formateur and had substantial influence over this actor’s cabinet picks. At times, the president could even override the decisions of the formateur regarding coalition partners. For instance, in 1987, “President Mauno overruled a coalition between the Centre Party and the National Coalition, indicating that a coalition between the National Coalition and the Social Democrats was preferable.”480 Other strong leaders such as the former president Urho Kekkonen, who had dominated the Finnish political scene for nearly three decades from 1956 to 1982,481 enjoyed these prerogatives to the fullest. He had “selected prime ministers, pushed parties into coalitions, forced governments to resign, appointed non-partisan presidential cabinets and dissolved parliaments.”482 The first constitutional amendment in 1991, introducing the parliamentary vote of investiture, was enacted as a reaction to “the excesses of the Kekkonen era”483 and marked the beginning of what would become a profound transformation in Finnish politics toward parliamentarization. Arter confirms that the president used to be a “veto Page 158 →player” in government formation prior to 2000, and a governing party would strictly follow the president’s policy preferences, thus making it “the president’s party.”484 Today, experts argue that Finland is effectively a parliamentary system, where the government is situated at the center of the executive branch.485\n\nThe uneven distribution of power between the government and the president in favor of the latter prior to 1991 had been observed vividly in the foreign policy domain. The 1919 constitution stated that “the relations of Finland with foreign powers shall be determined by the President.”486 Whereas the president had full authority to conduct Finland’s relations prior to 1990, “foreign policy issues entered internal party debates” soon after, signaling greater partisan interest in this area.487 Berglund explains that the “individual candidates” running for office “focused on foreign policy to a hitherto unparalleled extent” in the run-up to the 1991 general elections, signaling this change in interest among those eyeing the parliamentary seat.488 A second constitutional amendment in 1993 further weakened the powers of the president in foreign affairs. It stipulated explicitly that the parliament would “take part in the national preparation of matters to be decided in international bodies.”489\n\nThe European integration process has also altered “the situation to the advantage of the government and the Eduskunta,” effectively parliamentarizing the country’s EU policy and removing the president’s veto power in this domain.490 In a subsequent amendment, EU affairs were separated “from the President’s mandate and stipulated that the Government is responsible for Finland’s EU policy (including foreign and security policy).”491 In matters pertaining to the EU, the government was thus given primary authority to lead Finland’s policies. Up until 2000, non-EU foreign policy issues were governed by the president. The new constitution that went into effect in 2000 has also revised this division of duties, where the president would conduct foreign policy in consultation with the government. Except for certain foreign policy engagements (such as official state visits), the governmentPage 159 → would now assume visible competency in foreign policy decision making in addition to having primary authority over EU matters.492 As I will demonstrate, the parliament and the government were responsible for Finland’s decision to join the eurozone; the Finnish president was hardly an influential actor in the process.\n\nFor simplicity’s sake, the EMU decision is generally referred to as “joining the EMU” or “joining the eurozone” in the literature; in fact, the 1998 decision captures the “third” and final stage of the broader process that integrated the first set of EU member states to the European Economic and Monetary Union. The first stage, which took place between 1990 and 1993, included policy harmonization toward the free movement of capital in the EU. Policy harmonization continued during the second stage (1994–1998) with the objective to ensure economic convergence among the member states. The third and final stage would introduce the euro as the EU’s common currency, fixed exchange rates, and the single monetary policy along with the Stability and Growth Pact. The first two stages were preparatory policy stages, whereas the third stage called for the implementation of these policies, including an “irrevocable” shift in the monetary policies of the member states.493 The third stage also involved the prospective EMU members’ national ratification. In Finland, the parliament was responsible for ratification.494 It is therefore meaningful and necessary to focus on the governing parties—which enjoyed a comfortable majority in the parliament—as the key actors behind the EMU decision.\n\n“Moving Home”: Finland’s Post–Cold War Foreign Policy and Relations with the EU\n\nFinland’s Cold War foreign policy was complicated. Having fought against the Soviet Union more than once during the Second World War and sharing a lengthy border with it, the country had a complex relationship with Page 160 →its eastern neighbor and occupied a difficult position in Europe throughout the Cold War.495 During this period, the country’s foreign policy “resembled a balancing act between maintaining close—but not too close!—relations with the Soviet Union.”496 Although Finland considered itself a neutral country, it had still signed a Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Treaty in 1948 with the Soviet Union.497 “Finlandization” became a term meaning “subservience to the Soviet Union and a tendency to anticipate and comply with Soviet wishes even before they are formulated.”498 For instance, the Finnish president, who had actively shaped coalition formation up until 1987, would not allow the Conservatives (later known as the National Coalition Party or KOK) to join the government for “general reasons,” which was “a code for unacceptable in high places,” implying none other than the Kremlin.499\n\nThe final years of the Soviet Union had witnessed a disintegration of these practices. The tacit Soviet embargo on Finnish coalitions ended by 1987, when the Conservatives won the elections that year and were allowed to assume office thanks to Kekkonen’s departure from the Finnish presidency and Mikhail Gorbachev’s lukewarm reception of the party’s victory.500 With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, Finland had “abandoned neutrocentrism”501 and dissolved the Friendship Treaty.\n\nLike every other small state on the European continent, Finland too began its pursuit of a new foreign and security policy as soon as the Cold War ended.502 Observing how Sweden—its neighbor to the west—pivoted toward the EU and applied for full membership in 1991, Finland quickly followed suit.503 The political elites in Finland were by and large united on the country’s membership. Except for the Left Alliance and the Greens, which remained indecisive, and the Christian League, which was against membership, the other political parties supported joining the EU.504 Finland became a member of the European Union on January 1, 1995.505 ForsbergPage 161 → and Vaahtoranta argue that a key reason for Finland’s decision to join the EU was security; specifically, to distance itself from Russian influence once and for all in the aftermath of the Cold War.506 Some have explained in dramatic terms that Finland was “moving home” to the West, expressing that “the historical parenthesis of the Cold War” was closed with its entry into the EU.507 The country was particularly enthusiastic about the European Union upon becoming a full member precisely because it did not want to be known as the “belated European.”508\n\nThe end of the Cold War therefore removed two key constraints on Finland’s domestic politics and foreign policy. First, the Soviet Union’s influence over Finland’s international relations had disappeared, allowing the country to act without systemic constraints and to recalibrate its foreign policy objectives in the direction of the European Union. Second and relatedly, the Soviet influence over Finland’s domestic politics had also disappeared and the country’s sovereignty was no longer hostage to great power politics. Alongside the constitutional changes discussed above, one can conclude that Finland’s decision to join the European Monetary Union was determined primarily by the country’s own domestic political dynamics without any substantial interference from the international system.509 Further, the parliamentarization of Finnish domestic politics and especially its foreign policy with respect to the EU gave much greater agency to the parliament and the surplus coalition government that came to power in 1995.\n\nThat said, Finland’s foreign policy decisions were not entirely immune to regional considerations in the post–Cold War period. There was a lot of debate during the mid-1990s on whether Finland should join the EMU, especially when two of its closest trading partners at the time, Sweden and the UK, were not interested in the common currency zone. Indeed, between 1995 and 1998, Sweden and the UK were among Finland’s top three largest trading partners alongside Germany, where their combined trade share was consistently twice that of Germany.510 An Economist Intelligence Unit report from 1996—nearly three years prior to Finland’s membership in the EMU—had speculated whether the country would want to be a eurozone member when “its second largest trade partner, Sweden” Page 162 →was “less likely to fulfill the criteria” to join the currency union.511 Although the former governor of the Bank of Finland, Sirkka Hamalainen, emphasized by the mid-1990s that nonparticipation was not an option and that Finnish exporters could compete in the eurozone “irrespective of whether the UK and Sweden participated or not,”512 her successor commented in an address a decade later that the hesitancy of these two countries was in fact a real concern for Finnish policymakers at the time.513 The opposition Center Party was keen on this condition in particular; it had asserted that the party would be opposed to membership unless Sweden and Britain joined the currency union.514\n\nThese considerations did not have a lasting impact on Finland’s foreign policy, however. If the Finnish government had not wanted to join the EMU, some of this reluctance may have been due to similar reticence on behalf of its Swedish and British counterparts. That the Finnish government was ultimately strongly in favor of EMU membership despite the lack of interest from Sweden and the UK suggests that concerns over regional trade were less central to the governing parties’ decision-making calculus.\n\nThe ‘Rainbow Coalition’ Brings Finland into the Eurozone: What Explains?\n\nThe Finns went to the polls in March 1995 to elect their new parliament. The Social Democratic Party declared victory, receiving 28 percent of the national vote but falling short of a legislative majority.515 The SDP’s leader (and later prime minister), Paavo Lipponen, thus brought together four other political parties to form the next government. These included the conservative National Coalition Party (KOK), the right-wing Swedish People’s Party (RKP), the Green League (VIHR), and the Left Alliance (VAS). Table 6.1 below summarizes the parties’ share of seats in the two-hundred-seat parliament as well as their locations on the left-right political spectrum based on the Chapel Hill Expert Survey data.516\n\nLooking at table 6.1, it is clear that the Lipponen government was a Page 163 →large surplus majority coalition. The Social Democrats joined forces with the National Coalition Party (one of the Big Three) and cleared the majority threshold with a total of 102 seats. In addition to enjoying majority control, the SDP-KOK axis in government also fragmented the parliamentary opposition. The three minor parties—VAS, RKP, and VIHR—were thus not vital for the coalition’s survival and were considered surplus parties. This diverse coalition, which included those from the right as well as the left of the political spectrum, was dubbed the “rainbow coalition.”\n\nTable 6.1. Lipponen’s ‘Rainbow Coalition’ (1995)\n\nNo. of Seats (%)\n\nL-R Ideological Placement (L: 0—R: 10)\n\nSocial Democratic Party (SDP)\n\n63 (31.5)\n\n3.4\n\nNational Coalition Party (KOK)\n\n39 (19.5)\n\n7.6\n\nLeft Alliance (VAS)\n\n22 (11)\n\n2.4\n\nSwedish People’s Party (RKP)\n\n12 (6)\n\n6.6\n\nGreen Party (VIHR)\n\n9 (4)\n\n3.8\n\nTotal (200)\n\n145 (72.5)\n\nArchival records from EILEN suggest that in December 1997 the Lipponen government proposed a parliamentary vote to be held in 1998 to decide Finland’s participation in the EMU.517 The parliament began debating the government’s EMU proposal by February 1998 and voted in April 1998 to dissolve the Finnish markka and be among the first group of countries to join the eurozone by January 1999. In the next national elections held in March 1999, the SDP would manage to maintain its leading position and form the new government with the same four coalition partners, again under Paavo Lipponen’s leadership.\n\nIdeological Composition: Let us go back to the mid-1990s and look more closely at Lipponen’s first “rainbow coalition.” Where did the coalition parties stand on the EMU proposal? Were they all supportive of abandoning their national currency and adopting the euro? Experts argue that Finnish political parties are hardly Euroskeptic and generally supportive of European integration.518 The empirical evidence consistently suggests, however, that initially the coalition parties were far from unanimously supportive of entering the eurozone. Rather, they began to moderate their positions in favor of membership as the parliamentary vote approached. Whereas the major coalition partners were mostly for joining the EMU, Page 164 →the minor partners, specifically the Green League and the Left Alliance, rejected the proposal for quite some time before they ultimately reversed their positions and converged with the rest of the coalition.\n\nThe senior coalition partner and the party of the prime minister, the SDP, had been an avid supporter of the EU project since Finland’s application for full membership in 1991.519 Analysts at the Economist observe that the Social Democrats are “deeply pro-European.”520 With regards to the EMU, however, SDP was not exactly in unison at first. In October 1996, the leader of the SDP’s parliamentary group stated that the “EMU was premature for the EU as a whole and that it should be postponed for at least ten years.”521 Despite these credible specks of opposition inside the party, the SDP party congress held in September 1997 achieved “near unanimous” agreement in support for joining the EMU by the beginning of 1999.522 This was an important affirmation of the influence the party leadership and Prime Minister Lipponen played, since it was reported only a few months prior to the congress that there were “a significant number” of SDP members “who [were] undecided” alongside “a small number who [were] firmly opposed” to the EMU.523\n\nLike SDP, its junior coalition partner KOK also supported Finland’s membership in the EMU, even though it was opposed to the prospect of a supranational, federal Europe.524 KOK’s party congress in June 1997 concluded that “in order to secure [Finland’s] international position, it is in Finland’s national interest to participate in the EU’s inner core established as a result of the EMU.”525 The right-wing Swedish People’s Party, one of the surplus parties in the government with twelve parliamentary seats, also declared support for the EMU during its party congress in June 1997.526 The constitutional committee of the Finnish parliament concluded later that year that the government would need only a simple majority of votes to approve the EMU proposal in the parliament, as the Economist reported.527 The support of these three coalition parties—SDP, KOK, and RKP—was therefore sufficient to fold Finland into the EMU.\n\nPage 165 →Coming to terms with the EMU proposal was a lot more complicated for the two remaining (and left-wing) parties in the Lipponen coalition. Indeed, the Left Alliance (VAS) and the Green League (VIHR) had struggled to take a definitive position on Finland’s EMU membership for quite some time.528 For both parties, their presence in the Lipponen government was critical. It was the Greens’ first executive experience following the party’s establishment in 1987. Similarly, it was the Left Alliance’s first government role since the party had revamped itself in 1991.529 Although the party considered its senior partner, the National Coalition (KOK), “the most bourgeois or conservative of the large parties,” VAS still decided to join the government upon SDP’s invitation despite the risk of losing votes later.530\n\nInitially, the Left Alliance was strongly opposed to the EMU proposal. “A majority of VAS members had historically been opposed to EU membership and the issue [the EMU] had the potential to split the party, paralyse [sic] it politically and possibly even lead to its removal from the government.”531 Several reports from the Economist Intelligence Unit had predicted throughout 1996 and 1997 that the party would leave the coalition government given its disagreement with the senior coalition partners.532 Indeed, analysts observed that VAS still did not have a definitive stance on the EMU membership as late as December 1997. The chair of VAS, Claes Andersson, was supportive, while Esko Seppänen, a high-profile member of the European Parliament from VAS, was not.533 The two men were pulling the party in opposite directions.\n\nThe Greens were similarly in disarray. The Economist expected in early 1996 that the party would leave the government because of its opposition to EMU, among other policy issues.534 Although VIHR did not leave the government, it did diverge from the SDP and the KOK and declare in the summer of 1997 that it was against Finland’s EMU membership. The party Page 166 →added, however, that this was not its final decision and that it would not have one until the end of 1997.535\n\nBy the early 1998, the Greens and the Left Alliance had neither torpedoed the parliamentary vote on the EMU nor leave the coalition in protest. Both parties held their party congresses in December 1997 and January 1998,536 respectively, after the constitutional committee decided that a “simple majority” in the parliament would be enough to ratify Finland’s membership in the EMU. In other words, the support of these two surplus parties was not necessary to secure the parliamentary vote. Still, both parties ultimately decided to support Finland’s entry into the EMU during the parliamentary vote. The vote took place in April 1998, “with 135 MPs in favour, 61 against, one abstaining, and two absent.”537 This was a puzzling outcome given the extent of the public opposition in Finland against joining the EMU at the time.\n\nPublic Opinion: What impact did public opinion have on the EMU decision? As I show below, it seems it had no effect at all. But perhaps this was because the EMU was a complex policy issue on which opinion was just difficult for voters to formulate. Or perhaps it was not salient for the Finns at all because it was too technical. The evidence suggests otherwise. The EMU was by no means a peripheral policy debate for the country. It was extremely salient at both elite and mass levels. International observers comfortably claimed in 1996 that the issue would not only be the “focus of foreign policy”538 and “dominate policy over the next two years” but that the Lipponen coalition would also “need to lobby hard to persuade a skeptical public of the benefits of a single currency.”539 And they were right. One year later, the EMU was still considered “the thorniest issue” for the government.540\n\nThe poll numbers explain it all. During the summer of 1996, 60 percent of Finns were opposed to joining the EMU.541 President Martti Ahtisaari boldly commented at the time that “the negative attitude of citizens toward the EMU would have time to change before the elections.”542 More than a year later, the European Commission’s November 1997 Eurobarometer Page 167 →survey reported Finland as the country second most opposed to the EMU after Britain: 62 percent of the Finnish respondents did not support adopting the euro.543 The leader of the opposition Center Party (KESK), Esko Aho, commented on the day of the parliamentary vote that “there was a lack of public support for EMU.”544 Indeed, only 40 percent of the Finns supported the EMU by April 1998.545\n\nTable 6.2 presents how the government and opposition parties voted in the parliament in April 1998 and where their voters stood regarding the EMU. Clearly the governing parties were far away from their voters. Even KOK, the most pro-EMU party among them, barely reflected the preferences of its voters. The parliamentary group voted unanimously for the EMU even though only about half of their supporters were in favor of the currency union, as table 6.2 shows. The KOK leader and the coalition’s finance minister, Sauli Niinistö, said afterwards that “none of the EMU decisions” was driven by the “information from opinion polls.”546 Similarly, Prime Minister Lipponen “insisted that it was more important to lead the discussion [on EMU] than to focus on public opinion.”547 Remarkably, 80 percent of the respondents believed as early as October 1997 that the government would join the currency union anyway, according to a poll conducted by the Center for Finnish Business and Policy Studies.548 It seems the voters were right to anticipate this result given the statements of their decision makers. But how could these parties act so out of step with their voters and still commit to this foreign policy decision? Were they not concerned about its potential electoral consequences?\n\nResponsibility Diffuses, Parties Prefer to Remain Loyal to Each Other: The Finns went to the polls again in March 1999 to elect their next parliament. Table 6.3 provides their vote shares in the March 1995 and March 1999 elections, as well as their electoral support by April 1998 when the parliamentary vote took place. Even though SDP lost a dozen seats in 1999, the party still received the most votes and formed the next government with the same four parties that made up the 1995 coalition and had voted in favor of the EMU one year prior. Despite the divergence of preferences between the coalition parties and their voters, the parties, especially Page 168 →the VAS and VIHR—both of which had reversed their EMU positions in the run-up to the April vote—were not significantly punished in the 1999 national elections.\n\nTable 6.2. April 1998 Parliamentary Vote and Public Support for the EMU\n\nTotal seats\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAbstain\n\n% Support for EMU among voters (Feb–Mar 1997)\n\nTogether, tables 6.2 and 6.3 present some interesting figures. Although support for the EMU was nearly uniformly low across all partisans, it did not have a uniform effect on vote choice in the 1999 national elections. The Greens, after reversing their EMU position regardless of the low support among their supporters, ended up gaining seats in 1999. Equally remarkable is that SDP and the main opposition party, KESK, received almost identical vote shares. Observers at the Economist claimed at the time that this was a result of policy convergence among the SDP, KOK, and KESK,549 which further made it difficult for voters to identify the differences between them. Indeed, even though KESK was visibly against the EMU in the run-up to the April 1998 vote, they declared during the general election season that they would not overturn the parliament’s EMU decision should they form the next government.550\n\nDescribing the Finnish political landscape, Raunio explains that “partisan cooperation in multi-party governments . . . makes it harder for the voters to assess the performance of their representatives, particularly considering the lack of transparency which is characteristic of coalition government decision making.”551 As I explained in chapter 2, the diffusion of Page 169 →responsibility among coalition parties impedes the voters’ ability to punish them for unpopular policies. This is most pronounced in oversized coalitions, where the coalition is larger than necessary and not every coalition party enjoys a credible veto power it could use should the party disagree with government policy. In the absence of that veto threat, these parties choose to go along with the rest of the government because they can afford to do so: their voters will not be able to punish them anyway, and, true to their office-seeking instincts, they would rather stay inside the government than outside it.\n\nTable 6.3.

Neither the SDP’s nor KOK’s leadership considered the low public support for EMU a problem, as their statements illustrated, and they maintained their electoral ground. Voters not only failed to punish their incumbent parties and replace them with those in the opposition, but even some of those governing parties making “ideological U-turns”552 ended up getting rewarded with more seats. Isaksson explains that “if a supplementary party acts too independently, it may be omitted from the next governing coalition.”553 If parties anticipate that they will get re-elected in the next elections despite having signed off on policies that contradict their platforms and ignore their partisans’ policy preferences, then they might Page 170 →choose to remain loyal to their coalition partners in the hopes that they will get invited again to govern in the future.\n\nThis is what took place in Finland with regards to the EMU debate, and it resulted in the same five parties forming Lipponen’s second “rainbow coalition.” The governing parties prioritized peer credibility over voter responsiveness because the structure of their coalition allowed them to do so.554 As a result, they were able to make foreign policy commitments despite the public’s preferences. The nature of the surplus majority coalition (and, naturally, the weakness of the parliamentary opposition due to its being both structurally and situationally, as well as institutionally,555 vulnerable) explains why coalition parties—especially the surplus partners—prefer to remain loyal to their government instead of to their constituents. Knowing that their departure would not upset the government’s majority status in the parliament, these parties preferred remaining inside than out.\n\nThis explains why VAS and VIHR changed their initial positions. Soon after the Left Alliance and the Greens decided to support the EMU, analysts concluded that the parties had reversed their decisions in order to remain in the government.556 Interestingly, the Left Alliance leadership combined their internal EMU vote with the question of whether to remain in the government or not precisely in order to force the party members to compromise on the former. The result was 52.4 percent in favor, indicating how precarious the leadership’s position was.557 Similarly, the Greens decided to support the EMU despite their voters’ opposition to it (46 percent of them were against) because not doing so would weaken their minister’s role in the cabinet.558 Karttunen similarly concludes that the governing parties disregarded their constituents in this period.559 They wanted “to develop into credible parties of government that would be more attractive Page 171 →to voters as well as to other government parties in the future.”560 Raunio also observes in the context of the EMU decision that “in order to be considered as realistic and trustworthy coalition partners, parties have adopted positions that have been at least partially contradictory to the preferences of their voters.”561 What needs to be highlighted here is that each incumbent party could take this risk only because each one expected to get re-elected, and this was only possible because these parties were part of a bigger coalition that diffused the responsibility of an unpopular decision such as EMU membership. The distribution of votes and seats across 1995 and 1999 presented in table 6.3 supports this conclusion.\n\nThis is remarkably different from the Swedish experience, which presents a nice counterfactual to my argument. Sweden was also debating EMU membership in the 1990s, where public opposition to it was around 60 percent, just like in Finland.562 Sweden, however, was ruled by a single-party minority government at the time, as it often is. Blame avoidance by responsibility diffusion was therefore not possible for Swedish prime minister Göran Persson’s Social Democratic government. Instead, the government’s structural constraints necessitated working together with the parliamentary opposition through logrolling. The opposition Center Party, which was the government’s key ally in the parliament and helped it clear the majority threshold prior to the 1998 elections, was strongly opposed to the EMU. In order not to jeopardize its relationship with the Center, Persson and the Social Democrats had to shelve the EMU proposal.563\n\nA spokesperson for the Finnish Social Democratic Party explained in an interview, comparing the political situation in two countries: “You just need to understand that we do not have a two-block system like in Sweden for instance. . . . You have to be prepared that two or three of the biggest parties might form the basis of the government.”564 Since Finnish parties always had to be prepared for interparty cooperation as a result of their oversized coalition tradition, and since they were able to avoid voter punishment precisely because of the structure of their coalitions, Lipponen’s coalition in Finland was able to commit to the EMU decision while Persson’s single-party minority government in Sweden could not. Experts contendPage 172 → that public opinion is more consequential in foreign policy making in Sweden than it is in Finland565 and that legislators in Sweden prioritize public opinion whereas in their Finnish counterparts emphasize elite opinion.566 From the perspective of responsibility diffusion, it is no wonder that the public opinion on EMU could easily be sidelined in Finland whereas the incumbents in Sweden did not have this option.\n\nPolitical Leadership: Controlling a safe majority in the parliament, Lipponen’s oversized coalition enjoyed comfortable room for maneuver in policymaking. Did it also give Lipponen himself the ability to shape the EMU process? How influential was his role in Finland’s decision to join the currency union? Were there other individuals in the government who were able to pull the government toward a “yes” vote? How powerful was the effect of leadership, compared to the effect of coalition dynamics, on the EMU decision?\n\nCabinet ministers and the prime minister are influential actors in Finnish governments. While cabinet ministers have been exerting strong agency in policymaking for several decades, the prime minister has become a more visible actor in foreign affairs, especially after Finland’s EU membership, as I have explained earlier. Experts comment that “the prime minister’s office has already carved out a prominent role for itself, in particular in relation to the European Council summits.”567 Finnish officials corroborate this observation, explaining that “the prime minister has taken the lead in shaping the governments’ positions on European integration” since the country’s entry into the EU.568\n\nEvidence suggests that Prime Minister Lipponen was quite influential in the EMU decision. For one, he had always been strongly interested in foreign affairs. He had “served as head of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. He has also consciously worked to make Finland an influential country in the core of Europe. This doctrine has become a cornerstone of Finnish foreign policy” throughout his prime ministerial tenure between 1995 and 2003.569 Lipponen was unequivocally supportive of Finland’s entry into the EMU. He had argued that “membership would be ‘incontestably right’ for the country and that participation in Page 173 →the EMU was a logical extension of Finland’s increasingly pro-European policy orientation.”570 Having “consolidated his position within the [Social Democratic] party,” Lipponen was unchallenged.571 This was perhaps most apparent in the party’s decision to approve the EMU proposal prior to the parliamentary vote. Despite the opposing voices among party members, the SDP executive council voted 53 to 3 to support the EMU, largely thanks to him.572\n\nIn the government, the prime minister’s pro-EMU rhetoric was similarly assertive. He had emphasized in 1996—months before VAS and VIHR reached their final decisions to ultimately support the EMU—that “the government’s determination to join the single currency is in no doubt.”573 Later on, Lipponen argued quite brazenly that he was by no means “forcing Finns into EMU. . . . He said that public opinion does not consist solely of opinion polls, but includes opinions in the press, organizations, and political parties.” According to him, there was “broad public support.”574\n\nFinance minister and KOK leader Sauli Niinistö was also quite influential in shaping Finland’s EMU policy, and he echoed Lipponen’s views.575 He, too, was pro-EU and “firmly committed” to Finland’s EMU membership.576 Niinistö emphasized that postponing the decision (which was suggested by several MPs from VAS, VIHR, and SDP at the time) “would jeopardize [Finland’s] credibility in economic policy.”577 Both leaders were aware of the public resistance against the currency zone, which is why they insisted that the EMU decision be taken by a simple majority vote in the parliament as opposed to a referendum.578 Raimo Sailas, who served as permanent secretary to Niinistö in the ministry, explained in an interview that “EMU was personified by Paavo Lipponen and Sauli Niinistö” and that “they started to work systematically toward this goal [of EMU membership].”579\n\nGiven the nature of the coalition in Finland and the electoral leeway it provided the governing parties to avoid the negative public opinion Page 174 →against EMU, it seems that Lipponen and Niinistö’s influence was consequential only to the extent allowed by the structure of their coalition. Let us consider the counterfactual again. Had SDP (Lipponen) or KOK (Niinistö) led a minimum-winning coalition with VAS or VIHR as their junior partners, their leadership would not have been as critical precisely because these junior parties would use their veto power and quite possibly pull these leaders toward a compromise outcome, such as postponing the EMU decision, as opposed to doubling down on these leaders’ preferences and voting for EMU membership. In the absence of this credible threat and given the anticipation that they would avoid electoral blame, the two parties went along with the rest of their governing partners. The nature of the surplus coalition government therefore provided the two leaders with greater room to assert their leadership.\n\nDid the EU Law Predetermine EMU Membership? A final alternative explanation that the subject matter of this case study compels me to consider involves the EU’s own legal procedures regarding integration. Some experts, and certainly Lipponen and Niinistö, had argued that Finland was already on the path to becoming an EMU member because of the EU’s legal framework. Niinistö, for instance, claimed that the EMU decision was preordained because the country had already signed the EU’s foundational Maastricht Treaty when it entered the EU and “thereby approved membership in the EMU if the Union’s institutions decide to establish it.”580 So one could claim that the entire interparty struggle in Finland from 1996 to 1998 was for nothing, given the EU’s own rules.\n\nOnce again, Sweden’s experience with the EMU provides important insights that help me rule out this explanation. Although Sweden, too, had signed the Maastricht Treaty as it joined the EU alongside Finland in 1995, it chose to remain outside of the EMU. This suggests that EU member states are allowed to decide independently whether to abandon their national currencies or not.581 Joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was a required preliminary step to adopting the euro that involves pegging the exchange rates across the member states, but countries could join the ERM, pegging their currencies, without taking the next step of adopting the euro. Finland and Denmark joined the ERM in October 1996 and January 1999, respectively, but Denmark opted out of the euro while Finland adopted it. In other words, the EU’s procedural requirements were Page 175 →far from predetermining Finland’s commitment to the EMU. It was a conscious decision made by the governing parties and one that was voted for in the parliament in the face of strong and consistent public opposition.\n\nConclusion\n\nWriting in the wake of the parliamentary vote on Finland’s EMU membership, Raunio summarized the governing parties’ behavior as a “gamble.”582 According to him, the parties gambled by preferring to align with each other at the expense of their voters. They defied their constituents but still got re-elected despite the unpopularity of their decision. Further, they got to form the next government in 1999.\n\nI have argued in this chapter that the nature of government in Finland explains how the incumbent parties were able to commit to the unpopular decision to join the EU’s currency zone and return to government in the next elections. I therefore disagree with Raunio. The parties’ behavior was far from a gamble; rather, it was a strategic behavior that was facilitated by their oversized coalition. Precisely because responsibility was diffused inside this government, the incumbent parties, especially those without veto power, wanted to remain on good terms with their counterparts. The parties anticipated two things. First, they expected to get re-elected because voter accountability was much lower in a large coalition like theirs than it would be in a single-party government (like Sweden) and that they would thus not be punished by the voters for their support for the EMU. Second, the junior parties in particular knew how the fragmented nature of the political system and the long tradition of surplus majority coalitions in Finland meant that the senior parties could consider them potential partners in the future. Since influencing policy from the opposition seats was difficult in this country (they could hardly influence it even from the inside, as this chapter has shown), the parties remained loyal to the other governing parties in order to maximize their chances of joining the next government.\n\nIt must be noted that what took place in Finland was different from logrolling. Since the players involved in logrolling need each other, such exchange entails mutual concessions. In chapter 4, I illustrated how logrolling occurred when the governing parties in Denmark had to offer concessions to an opposition party to secure their parliamentary support Page 176 →for the Iraq war. In chapter 5, I showed how the D66’s desire for seats in Balkenende’s incoming coalition was powerful, but also that Balkenende (and his CDA) needed D66 to form a majority coalition. In Finland, however, there was no such reciprocity between the governing parties. Specifically, the surplus parties in Lipponen’s coalition had no incentive to defect because they knew their defection would be inconsequential for policy. In this sense, what they engaged in was not logrolling; rather, it was a voluntary ceding of their policy position for the possibility that they would be potentially offered a seat in a future government by the bigger actors like KOK or SDP. Most critically, weak voter accountability allowed these parties to overlook public backlash against the EMU, reverse their policy position midway, and ultimately go along with their senior coalition partners.\n\nA long pedigree of research in comparative politics has shown that performance voting is less effective when the political context obscures who is responsible for government policies.583 As this chapter has demonstrated, in contexts like Finland where government responsibility is diffused inside oversized coalitions, incumbents can easily commit to unpopular foreign policy decisions and avoid their electoral consequences. While the assertive leadership of Prime Minister Lipponen and Finance Minister Niinistö was influential, particularly toward eliminating intraparty dissent, the evidence presented here gives us strong reasons to conclude that the structural opportunity provided by the oversized coalition was more central in explaining the governing parties’ decision to commit to the eurozone than was the role of these individual leaders."
