Moreover, national defense still plays a pivotal role in the construction of Finnish nationhood. The legacy of the Second World War, especially the myth of the heroic fight against the Soviet Union in 1939â€“1940, has given national self-defense a positive aura. Arguably, this historical experience has also shaped present-day perceptions on why Finland needs armed forces, how they should be organized and when and how they should be used."
