        "text": "Political Rights: 1\n\nCivil Liberties: 1\n\nStatus: Free\n\nPopulation: 5,200,000\n\nGNI/Capita: $23,780\n\nLife Expectancy: 78\n\nReligious Groups: Evangelical Lutheran (89 percent), Russian Orthodox (1 percent), none (9 percent), other (1 percent)\n\nEthnic Groups: Finnish (93 percent), Swedish (6 percent), other [including Lapp (Saami)] (1 percent)\n\nCapital: Helsinki\n\nOverview\n\nFollowing Finland's general elections in March 2003, its first female prime minister, Anneli Jäätteenmäki, served just two months in office before resigning amid scandal. The new prime minister, Matti Vanhanen, was chosen to replace her in June.\n\nFinland was ruled by Sweden until the early eighteenth century and then became a Grand Duchy of Russia until its independence in 1917. The country is traditionally neutral, but its army has had broad popular support ever since it fended off a Russian invasion during World War II. Finland joined the European Union (EU) in 1995 after its friendship treaty with the Soviet Union became void. It has been an enthusiastic member state and is the only Nordic country to have adopted the euro.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, Tarja Halonen of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) was chosen as the country's first woman president. She defeated four other female candidates – from a total field of seven – from across the political spectrum to serve a six-year term.\n\nThe Center Party came to power after winning 55 seats in the general elections held on March 16, 2003. The second-largest party, the SDP, had led the ruling rainbow coalition since 1995. It remains part of the new ruling coalition, which also includes the Center Party and the Swedish People's Party (representing the Swedish-language minority). Anneli Jäätteenmäki replaced the SDP's Paavo Lipponen as prime minister, becoming the first woman to hold the post. However, just two months after she was chosen, Jäätteenmäki stepped down when it was alleged that she had leaked information from classified foreign policy documents and then lied about having done so. Jäätteenmäki had used evidence from the documents in her public attacks against Lipponen's pro-U.S. stance with respect to the war in Iraq. After Jäätteenmäki's resignation in June, Center Party member Matti Vanhanen succeeded her.\n\nAt the European Convention in the second half of 2003, Finland was a leader of the smaller EU states. In opposition to a proposal under the draft EU constitution, it pushed for continued permanent representation of all states in the European Commission. Finland also pushed to preserve its neutrality by arguing against a proposed mutual-defense clause, although it does participate in the European security and defense policy.\n\nWith its combination of traditional and modern industries, Finland was ranked the most competitive economy in the world by the World Economics Forum in 2003. In addition to timber and metals, the country has a strong telecommunications sector, and the Finnish firm Nokia is the top mobile phone maker worldwide. Still, unemployment is above the average for the EU.\n\nPolitical Rights and Civil Liberties\n\nFinns can change their government democratically. The prime minister in Finland has primary responsibility for running the government. Representatives in the 200-seat unicameral parliament, called the Eduskunta, are elected to four-year terms. The Aland Islands – an autonomous region that is located off the southwestern coast of Finland and whose inhabitants speak Swedish – have their own 29-seat parliament and have one seat in the national legislature. They held elections for their own parliament on October 19. The indigenous Saami of northern Finland also have their own parliament.\n\nFinland has been rated the least corrupt country in the world in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index since 2000. The law against bribery applies both to government officials and business relations between companies. Finland has a large variety of newspapers and magazines. Newspapers are privately owned, some by political parties and their affiliates; others are controlled by or support a particular party. Finnish law gives every citizen the right to publish and guarantees the right of reply.\n\nFinns enjoy freedom of religion. Both the predominant Lutheran Church and the smaller Orthodox Church are financed through a special tax, from which citizens may exempt themselves. Other religious groups are eligible for tax relief if they register and are recognized by the government. Religious education is part of the curriculum in all public schools, but students may opt out of these classes in favor of more general education in religion and philosophy. The government respects academic freedom more broadly as well.\n\nFreedom of association and assembly are respected in law and in practice. Finnish workers have the right to organize, bargain collectively, and strike. At the start of 2002, more than 70 percent of workers belonged to a trade union.\n\nThe constitution provides for an independent judiciary, which consists of the Supreme Court, the supreme administrative court, and the lower courts. The president appoints Supreme Court judges, who in turn appoint the lower court judges.\n\nThe rights of ethnic and religious minorities are protected in Finland. Since 1991, the indigenous Saami, who make up less than 1 percent of the population, have been heard in the Finnish parliament on matters concerning them. The constitution guarantees the Saami cultural autonomy and the right to their traditional means of livelihood, which includes fishing and reindeer herding. Their language and culture are also protected through financial support. However, representatives of the community have complained that they could not exercise these rights in practice and that they do not have the right to self-determination in land use.\n\nWhile Roma (Gypsies) also make up a very small percentage of the population, they are more widely disadvantaged and marginalized. They have particular problems in the areas of housing, education, and employment, despite Finnish government efforts such as an ombudsman for minorities to counter discrimination. More than half of the Roma population in Finland is unemployed, mainly as a result of low levels of training and prevailing prejudice. The Ministry of Justice has engaged in an action plan for combating racism.\n\nWomen enjoy a high degree of equality with men in Finland. In 1906, Finland became the first country in Europe to grant women the vote, and the first in the world to allow women to become electoral candidates. In the current parliament, 38 percent of the delegates and 8 of 18 government ministers are women. Tarja Halonen was the first woman to be elected president in Finland. However, women continue to make 10 percent less than men of the same age, education, and profession, and they are generally employed in lower-paid occupations."
