        "text": "Sauli Niinistö (born August 24, 1948, Salo, Finland) is a Finnish lawyer and politician who became Finland’s first conservative head of state since the 1950s when he was elected president in 2012. He easily won reelection in 2018 and oversaw the accession of Finland to NATO in 2023.\n\nAfter earning a law degree from the University of Turku in 1974, Niinistö worked briefly as a rural police chief before establishing his own law practice (1978–88) and serving as an assistant judge for an appellate court (1976–88). He entered politics in 1977 with a seat on the city council of his birthplace, Salo, which he held until 1992.\n\nIn 1987 he was elected to the Eduskunta (Finland’s parliament) as a member of the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP). He served in parliament from 1987 to 2003 and was the chairman of the NCP from 1994 to 2001. In 1995 his wife of some 20 years was killed in an automobile crash, leaving Niinistö the single parent of two sons, an experience he wrote about movingly in the book Viiden vuoden yksinäisyys (2005; “Five Years of Solitude”). When the NCP joined the coalition government led by Paavo Lipponen of the Social Democratic Party, Niinistö became deputy prime minister (1995–2001) and served briefly as the minister of justice (1995–96) before helping to guide Finland through tough economic times and into the euro zone in 2002 as minister of finance (1996–2003). During that period he also was chairman of the European Democrat Union (1998–2002), a consortium of conservative political parties from across Europe. Calamity befell Niinistö again when he and his sons were caught in (but survived) the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 that devastated Thailand during their visit to that country.\n\nHaving rejected efforts to get him to run for president in 2000, he became the NCP’s presidential candidate in 2006 but lost narrowly to incumbent Tarja Halonen. From 2003 to 2007 he was vice president of the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank. Niinistö reentered parliament in 2007 and was chosen as its speaker (2007–11). In 2009 he married Jenni Elina Haukio, an NCP spokesperson, and became the chairman of the Football (soccer) Association of Finland (2009–12)."
