Finnish politcian Paavo Lipponen, who served two terms in office as the country's Prime Minister from 1995 to 2003, says the Stasi, which was the secret police of former East Germany, reached out to him in the 1970s. Lipponen is speaking out about his relationship with the DDR for the first time on YLE's Punainen lanka talk show, which will air on Wednesday evening.

"I really had to bite my tongue when they came and told me how to act in order to please the Soviet Union. At that point I had had enough," says Lipponen on the talk show.

Lipponen says he has been bewildered by the media's interest in uncovering Finnish Stasi agents.
