        "text": "Established in 1999, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation aims to empower children living in urban poverty by enhancing education, health and family economic stability. Initially rooted in Austin, Texas, the foundation has transcended local boundaries to encompass regions across the United States and extend globally, touching the lives of countless individuals.\n\nEfforts in India\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation provides improved access to financial services, employment opportunities, education and sustainable livelihoods for India’s urban poor. With 149 active projects spanning the nation, this commitment exceeds $180 million in investments, enriching the lives of children and fostering enduring changes within their communities.\n\nIn India, half of students need to catch up in reading and arithmetic, while 33% drop out before completing high school. Additionally, 60% of 18- to 21-year-olds need more preparation for the job market. To address these challenges and enhance educational outcomes for underserved students, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation invests in large-scale statewide projects to improve student learning, teaching skills, school administration and educational leadership.\n\nThe foundation has provided crucial financial support to two leading school finance companies in India. It enables school leaders to enhance learning environments and broaden access to high-quality education. This effort aims to bring about significant changes in India’s educational system and is now implementing in Rajasthan, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.\n\nAdditionally, in India, more than 400 million people are between the ages of 15 and 29, but many lack the skills needed for job opportunities. Acknowledging this pressing necessity, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation continues to work to improve families’ financial security.\n\nOne noteworthy project is a partnership with the Lighthouse Communities Foundation, which empowers young people with the horizontal and vertical skill sets necessary for workforce integration. With 16,000 job placements and 25,000 students enrolled, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation is pivotal in providing India’s youth with the essential tools to obtain meaningful employment, cultivating a road toward enduring prosperity and success.\n\nEfforts in South Africa\n\nAnother primary goal is to provide people in South Africa with employment opportunities. The foundation plays a vital part in promoting financial stability among South African households by utilizing brilliant collaborations with entities such as SweepSouth, which provides job placement services to the unemployed.\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation’s collaboration with SweepSouth has had a profound impact. Their technology is actively engaging more than 4,000 domestic workers, with a noteworthy 97% of them being women with children. Impressively, more than 80% of these individuals were previously unemployed. This initiative creates job opportunities and instills a sense of empowerment, enabling individuals to experience continuous personal and professional growth in South Africa.\n\nIn their commitment to enhancing educational opportunities for underserved youth in South Africa, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation supports the Funda Wande initiative, specifically the “Teach Reading for Meaning” program. This innovative project focuses on equipping teachers with advanced techniques to effectively teach reading, a skill crucial for academic success.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of this program lies in its approach. Teachers in South Africa receive training in their classrooms alongside their pupils. With this approach, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and “Teach Reading for Meaning” strive to bridge the educational gap, ensuring that all children attending no-fee schools have access to a high-quality education in South Africa.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation initially focused its charitable activities in the U.S. Its influence has expanded globally over time, becoming a positive change in the lives of children facing urban poverty. The foundation has never shied away from setting lofty objectives and this unshakable commitment will keep opening doors of transformation for those most in need."
