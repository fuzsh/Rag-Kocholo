        "text": "WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS DOES THE MICHAEL & SUSAN DELL FOUNDATION TYPICALLY FUND?\n\nWe fund social enterprises that directly serve or impact children or youth from urban low-income communities in the areas of education, health, and family economic stability (including livelihoods and financial inclusion). These social enterprises may be structured as for-profit or nonprofit entities.\n\nThe foundation will not fund nor continue to partner with organizations that condone, tolerate, or conduct activities that are racist, antisemitic, promote hate, or are otherwise contrary to the values of the foundation.\n\nWHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS DO NOT TYPICALLY RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE FOUNDATION?\n\nThe foundation only supports programs and organizations that fall within our key focus areas and align with our mission. Prioritizing those areas enables us to create opportunities for children and families to achieve their full potential.\n\nThe foundation does not provide grants to support:\n\n• Individuals\n\n• Medical research projects\n\n• Event fundraisers or sponsorships\n\n• Lobbying of any kind\n\n• Endowments\n\n• Infrastructure\n\n• Requests for computers, laptops, tablets, or other hardware\n\nMY GROUP NEEDS COMPUTERS. WILL THE FOUNDATION DONATE COMPUTERS OR TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT?\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation is not affiliated with Dell Technologies and does not supply computers or related technology equipment.\n\nHOW MUCH MONEY DOES THE MICHAEL & SUSAN DELL FOUNDATION PLAN ON CONTRIBUTING THIS YEAR?\n\nThe exact amount of the foundation’s contributions changes from year to year, depending on need and programs.\n\nHow do I apply for a grant or investment?\n\nSee detailed instructions on the application page.\n\nIs the process different among the United States, India, and South Africa?\n\nThere is one application for all geographies.\n\nWhat is a problem statement?\n\nA problem statement defines the unmet needs your organization is trying to address. It is a required part of the grant application. Your problem statement should:\n\n• Identify who you are trying to help and why.\n\n• Include data or numeric evidence documenting the scope of the problem affecting your target population.\n\n• Describe the geographic area where you work.\n\nFor example (numbers cited below are for illustrative purposes only):\n\nIn the XYZ school district in [country], 40 percent of fourth graders are reading one or more grade levels below proficiency as measured by the state standard reading test. The average percentage of students reading at grade level statewide is 82%, and the average for districts that are demographically like XYZ is 58%.\n\nWhat do you mean by outcomes?\n\nThe foundation funds programs and organizations that can document a measurable impact on the lives of children and families. Our application process asks that you show progress — through measurable data relevant to your problem statement — toward providing opportunities for children to achieve their full potential.\n\nWhat is baseline data or evidence?\n\nBaseline data and evidence numerically document the problem in your geographic area and target population. To demonstrate the outcomes or measurable progress of a program, you must be able to document your starting point. The baseline data is point A. The desired outcome is point B.\n\nA strong application helps us understand your plan to get from point A to B based on the baseline data and the desired outcome, and how the foundation’s support can help.\n\nWhat amount should I ask for?\n\nAs a guideline, the foundation does not fund more than 25% of a project’s budget or more than 10% of an organization’s total annual operating expenses.\n\nHow will I know if my grant request has been received?\n\nAfter you submit your funding request online, you will be directed to a confirmation web page with details on the timeline for review. After our team reviews your request in detail, we will email you about the status of your submission."
