The focus of the Dell Foundation is contributing to the quality of life in the U.S. communities where Dell employees live and work. We support programs that equip youth for success in our digital economy and the Connected Era. The Literate Community Grants are two-year, $50,000 awards that support non-profit organizations that address basic needs for quality education for young people, particularly in math, science and literacy.\n\nYou can see the full list of organizations receiving grants here. These organizations are a truly outstanding group of non-profits that are making a difference in the lives of youth and families every day and we are proud to be able to support them\n\nEarlier this year we announced our Healthy Community Grants, which support health and human service programs that address the critical and most basic health needs of children in Dell communities. And in the coming weeks we’ll announce the results of more grant rounds."
