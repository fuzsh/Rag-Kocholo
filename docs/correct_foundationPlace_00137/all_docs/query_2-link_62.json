        "text": "Starting this fall, University of Texas students with the most need will get a $20,000 scholarship, a laptop computer and personalized resources to support them on their path to graduation.\n\nThe aid comes from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which announced Friday it will contribute $100 million over 10 years to provide funding and support for low-income UT students. The goal is to boost graduation rates for students who are prone to dropping out for personal and financial reasons.\n\nThe partnership is an extension of the foundation’s Dell Scholars Program, which has supported low-income students across the country since 2004. This is the third-largest private donation in UT’s history.\n\nAs part of the partnership with UT, the Dell Foundation will provide individualized support for Pell Grant-eligible and other low-income students at UT, the majority of whom come from families with an annual income of $30,000 or less. Students with the most need will receive scholarships of $20,000.\n\nUT and Dell leaders expect the targeted support to drastically improve graduation rates for Pell Grant students, who have a six-year graduation rate of about 20% nationally, according to the foundation.\n\n“When you think about students that come from lower-resource backgrounds, financial support is obviously very important, that is a vital element of success,” said Janet Mountain, executive director of the Dell Foundation. “But what we know is that money alone is not delivering the graduation rates we need. ... These students need more than a check, they need support.”\n\nStarting in Fall 2020, the estimated 2,000 eligible students entering UT will be part of the new “UT for Me” program and receive personalized, multifaceted support to address “individual and systemic issues that create barriers to success,” according to the foundation. This will include financial aid coaching; financial literacy training; graduation planning; guided connection with university resources; peer advising; internship and career planning; tutoring; textbook support; and a laptop computer.\n\nUT for Me will be available to incoming Pell-eligible students starting this fall. Over the next 10 years, the program will help about 20,000 UT students.\n\nOf the 2,000 students from each incoming class, those with the greatest need, generally defined as those whose families can contribute less than $1,000 a year, will receive scholarships of $20,000 over four years and be considered Dell Scholars. UT estimates about 1,200 students from each incoming class will be eligible for the scholarship.\n\nUT President Gregory L. Fenves said the program is the next step in the school’s efforts to raise graduation rates. The six-year graduation rate for all UT students reached 85.6% last year, while the same rate for Pell Grant-eligible students was about 73%.\n\nIn partnership with the Dell Foundation, UT aims to raise six-year graduation rates for its Pell Grant recipients to 90%.\n\n“As a large public university in very large, diverse state, we have had a good track record in access and we want to close those gaps,” Fenves said. “We’re talking about hundreds of more students each year graduating than would otherwise be graduating.”\n\nThe partnership comes less than a year after the UT System Board of Regents approved a $160 million endowment designed to give full scholarships to Texas students with household incomes of $65,000 or less.\n\n“A college education has the power to change the life of a student and the future of their family and community,” Fenves said in a statement. “As a result of our groundbreaking partnership with the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the University of Texas at Austin is poised to increase opportunities for thousands of talented students whose potential to achieve will be met with unprecedented commitment, resources and support.”\n\nReina Olivas, a 2017 graduate of UT, said she’s excited to see more students get the opportunities she had. As an undergrad, Olivas was accepted into the national Dell Scholars program, allowing her to attend UT instead of a smaller school near her home in Houston.\n\n“I think that it will truly, truly be life changing for so many students just like it was for me,” she said.\n\nAs one of six siblings raised by a single parent and the first in her family to attend college, Olivas said she needed the extra support to make it to graduation day.\n\n“I think feeling supported and feeling like you’re not alone were probably some of the biggest things that really made a difference for me,” Olivas said. “The Dell Scholars program didn’t just say, ‘Here’s your check, good luck!’ They really put things in place that helped me kind of feel less homesick.”\n\nThe Dell Foundation, with the help of the university, will provide services and financial support for 10 years, after which the university plans to continue the program on its own dime. Fenves said the funds will be raised through UT’s capital campaign for student success.\n\n$232 million in 2003 from Dallas oilman John A. Jackson for geosciences\n\n$150 million in 2019 from the Moody Foundation for the forthcoming Moody Center\n\n$100 million in 2020 from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation for UT for Me\n\n$60 million in 2014 from the Mulva Family Foundation for engineering and business buildings\n\n$60 million in 2013 from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation for the Dell Medical School\n\nSource: The University of Texas; The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nUT’s largest private donations"
