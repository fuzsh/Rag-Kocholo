The foundation's grantmaking is structured to accelerate projects already making a difference. The foundation seeks to fund proven projects in the areas of education, health, and family economic stability — catalyzing them toward greater impact in the United States, India, and South Africa. The aim is to create long-term, systemic change through enduring partnerships.</p><p><br></p><p>Specific areas of focus are as follows:</p><ul><li><u>Education</u>: Millions of children from low-income backgrounds don't have the chance to attend a high-quality school. For those who do, unique challenges remain, making it harder for them to get to and through college. The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation invests in closing these opportunity gaps so all students can pursue a quality education, providing a pathway to prosperity for them and their families.<ul><li><u>Quality Schools</u>: The foundation collaborates with innovative organizations across sectors to facilitate systemic change and foster the growth of great schools.</li><li><u>Classroom Supports</u>: The foundation empowers educators with the information, tools, and skills needed to provide a positive learning experience for students that sets them up for success.</li><li><u>College Success</u>: The foundation provides students from low-income backgrounds with comprehensive, individualized support during their educational journey — from college preparation and completion to career placement or continued learning.</li></ul></li><li><u>Health</u>: Poverty and poor health are intertwined, feeding off each other and stacking the odds against millions of children and their families.
