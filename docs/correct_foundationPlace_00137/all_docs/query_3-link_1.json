        "text": "Susan Dell is co-founder and board chair of the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. As parents of four children, Susan and her husband Michael established the foundation in 1999 and dedicated its work to improving the lives of children and families living in urban poverty.\n\nOver the last 20 years, the foundation has committed $1.75 billion to non-profits and social enterprises focused on improving the lives of children and families in the United States, India and South Africa. The foundation focuses on providing resources to solve entrenched challenges in delivering high-quality K-12 urban education, in helping low-income students achieve university degrees, and in creating tangible pathways for families to achieve economic stability and to build healthy communities. Susan and Michael have also made substantial investments in healthcare in Austin, covering both medical education and clinical excellence, including Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, Dell Seton Medical Center, and Dell Children’s Medical Center. As part of their commitment to Texas, Michael and Susan also played a leadership role in marshalling financial resources and support in the wake of Hurricane Harvey by standing up the $100M Rebuild Texas Fund which came alongside Harvey-affected communities with help and resources for a three-year period following the storm.\n\nSusan has been a successful fashion entrepreneur, founding three fashion labels including the highly acclaimed luxury brand, Phi. She also spent many years as an elite athlete, competing in marathons, triathlons, and cycling races across the world. Susan is a lifetime trustee of Dell Children’s Medical Center, a board member of the Cooper Institute in Dallas, and a past member of the President’s Council for Physical Fitness and Sports. Susan was inducted into the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame in 2019."
