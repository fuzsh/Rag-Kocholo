Events were convened where Community members discussed what improvements they would like to see. This process and its findings are summarized in the Community Health Assessment (CHA). Using the community’s feedback, a comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was drafted. Partners and stakeholders throughout Austin/ Travis County are working on the CHIP’s strategies and objectives with the shared goal of making measurable progress in each area. Some of the Partners critical to the CHIP’s success include:\n\nAscension Seton\n\nAustin Public Health\n\nAustin Transportation Department\n\nBaylor Scott & White Health\n\nCapital Metro\n\nCentral Health\n\nIntegral Care\n\nSt. David’s Foundation\n\nTravis County Health and Human Services\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School\n\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health in Austin\n\nGet Involved!\n\nCommunity involvement and engagement is critical throughout the entire CHA/CHIP process. Partners present the progress of the CHIP on an ongoing basis and Austin/Travis County community-based organizations can request presentations. If you are interested in getting involved or want to request, a presentation please contact us by sending an email to ATC.CommunityHealthPlan@austintexas.gov.\n\nPartners can access contact lists, upcoming events, partner announcements, and workgroup documents through our Partner SharePoint Site. To request access, please email ATC.CommunityHealthPlan@austintexas.gov.\n\nCommunity Health Plan\n\nThe Community Health Plan is comprised of two major initiatives: our assessment phase and our implementation phase which has now moved from a five-year cycle to a three-year cycle. This process includes the completion of a CHA and a CHIP and includes our annual action plans.\n\nA CHA engages community members and local public health system partners to collect and analyze health-related data from many sources.\n\nInforms community decision-making\n\nPrioritizes health problems\n\nAssists in the development and implementation of community health improvement plans\n\nA CHIP is an action-oriented plan that outlines the community health issues based on CHA findings. The community and partners work together to identify how issues will be addressed and how to measure progress. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to improve the community’s health.
