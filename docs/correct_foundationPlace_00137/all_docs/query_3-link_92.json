        "text": "February 7, 2014\n\nPosted By : anudip_2018\n\n0 Comment\n\nKolkata, India – Anudip Foundation, an Indian skills development nonprofit, today announced a grant of INR 10 million, from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, a charitable foundation focused on improving the lives of impoverished children in the United States, South Africa and India. Over the next two years, the grant will help towards Anudip’s information technology-based vocational training, and cover 7,000 marginalized urban youth in Eastern India. Anudip will deploy the grant to offset its students’ training and placement costs, thereby enabling more urban youth to participate in India’s knowledge economy.\n\n“We are excited to have the opportunity to work with Anudip Foundation. We share their goal of helping the underprivileged, particularly in our foundation’s mission-related areas of education, health and family economic stability,” commented Debasish Mitter, India Country Director for Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. “By making IT, English and employability knowledge accessible, Anudip addresses a critical gap that exists today between the growing Indian economy and the country’s educated poor.”\n\nSince 2006, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation have invested more than $120 million in transforming the lives of children living in urban poverty in India. In addition to its focus on education and health, the foundation also sees skills-training as equally important in helping youth to overcome poverty in India. This investment is part of a strategy to establish high-quality, sustainable institutions that can train large numbers of employable youth.\n\nAnudip Foundation seeks to provide a pathway to new-economy livelihoods for impoverished youth in rural and urban areas in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Bihar. Its integrated model is recognized as proven, innovative and scalable. By providing educated, yet underprepared, youth with both IT-based skills training and placement services, Anudip has maintained an 80% placement success for over 20,000 students in its six-year history.\n\n“Anudip is delighted and honored to receive the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation’s support for its work. This grant will allow us to rapidly expand our student base from rural to urban communities,” said Dipak Basu, Anudip Founder and CEO. “We are confident of our ability to scale our operations, and meet commitments to our sponsors and beneficiaries.”\n\nAbout Anudip Foundation\n\nAnudip Foundation (www.anudip.org), with offices in India and USA, is dedicated to creating livelihood opportunities for impoverished people in rural areas and urban slums, by setting up a chain of training centers for skilled IT professionals and entrepreneurs, and by working with employers to develop its graduates for easy and quick placements. The foundation also provides financing and high-touch mentoring to enable students to set up small businesses in their own communities.\n\nAbout Michael & Susan Dell Foundation\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation (www.msdf.org) is dedicated to improving the lives of children living in urban poverty around the world. With offices in Austin, Texas, New Delhi,India, and Cape Town, South Africa, the Dell family foundation funds programs that foster high-quality public education and childhood health, and improve the economic stability of families living in poverty. The foundation has committed more than $1 billion to global children’s issues and community initiatives to date.\n\nIn the picture above, Debasish Mitter and Prachi Jain Windlass of MSDF have a serious conversation with Anudip alumni at the iMerit center in Metiabruz."
