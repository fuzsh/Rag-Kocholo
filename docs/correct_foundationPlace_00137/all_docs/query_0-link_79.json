        "text": "The fighting in Ukraine shows no signs of letting up.\n\n“I think for all of us it’s really difficult to sit and watch what’s happening in Ukraine right now,” Executive Director Janet Mountain said. “And it’s only getting harder and grimmer by the day.”\n\nAs a massive humanitarian crisis unfolds in Ukraine, we are seeing the suffering and sacrifice in real-time as the Russians continue their assault on Ukrainian cities full of innocent civilians.\n\n“I’m after all 100% Ukrainian on both sides,” Stephanie Dowbusz said.\n\nDowbusz is a Ukrainian in Austin with family and friends in the war zone.\n\n“It creates a lot of emotions,” Dowbusz said. “Sometimes I get really angry at what I’m seeing. Other times I just want to cry. You see bodies of children on TV. These women running away. Public building being destroyed by bombs and missiles.”\n\nDowbusz is not alone. Triggered by the same images, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation is taking action with a $15 million donation.\n\nThe executive director says the mission is to get the money on the ground as quickly as possible.\n\n“In a situation like this where it’s an active war zone, the situation is changing day by day, hour by hour and millions of people are exiting the county,” Mountain said. “What really makes a difference is added resources right now. Not the perfect plan two weeks from now but actually, right now, what are we doing to help people on the ground.”\n\nThe foundation sent the money to longtime partners that are no strangers to suffering and war.\n\n“Not only are they already imbedded in the region,” Mountain said. “They’re experts in how to respond in crises and how to get care to people as quickly as possible.”\n\nHere is a list of organizations the foundation has sent the money to in Ukraine. It breaks down into three categories, refugee help, medical help, and transportation help.\n\nDowbusz says the foundation’s gift will be critical and she hopes it inspires others to give.\n\n“It’s amazing and so necessary,” Dowbusz said. “Humanitarian aid right now is absolutely necessary right now. We’re talking about millions of people who are either refugees or internally displaced. They have no homes. They don’t have the basics we all take for granted.”\n\nAnd no one knows what they’ll return home to or if they’ll ever return home as this war shows no end in sight.\n\n“For Michael and Susan and for so many of us in the world its sitting here thinking about that kind of unimaginable hardship and really want to reach out a hand and try and come alongside in this moment of desperate need,” Mountain said."
