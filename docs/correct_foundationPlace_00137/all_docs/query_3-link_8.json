        "text": "OVERVIEW: The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation’s programs and grantmaking support education, career development, financial inclusion and health. Its geographic focus areas are the U.S., the Greater Austin area, India and South Africa.\n\nIP TAKE: The Dell Foundation’s mission has evolved over the years. Its initial focus was education and health in Texas and nationally; in 2017, as IP has reported, it expanded to include more extensive work in South Africa and India, as well as a greater focus on college success for low-income students. Across its areas of interest, Dell prefers evidence-based and results-driven programs and aims to effect broad change. Dell has also increased its impact investment activities, stating on its website that it invests in “mission-driven companies that are developing new products, tools, and services to improve the lives of people living in urban poverty.”\n\nDell is an accessible and transparent funder that hosts a rolling grant application form. Notably, Dell accepts applications from both for-profit and non-profit organizations. Grantseekers can also access detailed eligibility requirements and peruse Dell’s grants database. All told, Dell is an important funder to know about for grantseekers working within its areas of interest.\n\nPROFILE: Based in Austin, Texas, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation was established by Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell with his wife, Susan, in 1999. It is a private foundation that is not affiliated with Dell, Inc. The foundation’s overarching goal is to “accelerate opportunity for children growing up in urban poverty through improved education, health and family economic stability.”\n\nIn its early years, Dell focused its efforts on health and education in the Central Texas area, and was particularly known for making significant donations to established institutions. In 2006, for example, the foundation “provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children’s Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the UT Austin campus.” While Dell still supports these initiatives, its work has expanded to include education, health and economic development across the U.S. and in India and South Africa.\n\nThe Michael and Susan Dell Foundation’s stated grantmaking program areas are:\n\nQuality Schools\n\nClassroom Supports\n\nCollege Success\n\nJobs and Livelihoods\n\nFinancial Services\n\nHealth Innovation\n\nGrants for Education\n\nEducation is by far Dell’s largest area of funding, and grants support the sub-initiatives of quality schools, classroom supports and college success. All three programs prioritize students of low socioeconomic status and aim to close achievement gaps for underserved students. Grantmaking focuses on data-driven interventions and the expansion of highly effective programs. The education program also runs K-12 and higher education sub-initiatives that are exclusive to Central Texas.\n\nGrants for K-12 Education\n\nK-12 grantmaking stems from Dell’s quality schools and classroom supports programs. The quality schools program makes grants to school systems in Austin, Texas, in other areas of the U.S., and India and South Africa that are geared toward providing high quality educational experiences to students from low-income backgrounds.\n\nIn the U.S., grantmaking from this subprogram has focused on charter schools and increasing diversity and access. In India, the foundation has prioritized the implementation of research-based interventions that improve academic outcomes and the teaching of life skills that correlate with academic success.\n\nIn the Greater Austin area, Dell supports grantee partners that “help more students get an education that will set them up for success… and ensuring students from low-income areas gain the knowledge and skills to advance their education and careers.”\n\nSimilarly, in South Africa Dell has focused on programs that eliminate tuition and school fees, as well as increasing the quality of reading instruction. The classroom supports subprogram focuses on bringing “tools, technology and resources” to under-sourced classrooms.\n\nIn addition to technology-based learning interventions, the foundation has funded programs that help teachers assess student knowledge, analyze classroom data and plan for more effective instruction.\n\nK-12 grantees include South Africa’s Acorn Education, the Ed-Fi Alliance, Rocketship Public Schools and ClassKlap, a technology-driven education system that has had success in low-income areas in India.\n\nGrants for Higher Education\n\nDell’s college success initiative prioritizes low-income and first-generation college students in the U.S. and South Africa as they navigate the pressures and difficulties of postsecondary education. In the U.S., the foundation runs a signature program, Dell Scholars, which provides scholarships, mentoring, technology and other supports to students who meet the foundation’s GPA requirement of Grit, Potential and Ambition. Dell also supports programs in the Greater Austin area “to make higher education possible for more students in our region.”\n\nCohorts of Dell Scholars have achieved a six-year graduation rate of 80%, beating the national average of 20%. The success of the scholars program led the foundation to establish its enabling innovation program, which partners with large university systems and other organizations to develop similar systems of support for high-risk students.\n\nPartners have included the National Scholarship Providers Association, the University of Pretoria and Arizona State University.\n\nIn India, Dell administers the Dell Aspire Scholars program, which “empowers college students to achieve their professional aspirations and become leaders in their careers and communities.” Dell’s website states that this program is “embedded within Delhi Technological University and Hansraj College at Delhi University, two of India’s leading academic institutions.”\n\nIn South Africa, Dell runs the Dell Young Leaders Program, which is “designed to empower university students—many of whom are the first in their families to attend university—to reach graduation and begin a meaningful career.”\n\nGrants for Global Development\n\nDell’s family economic stability program makes grants through two sub-initiatives. The jobs and livelihoods program works in both India and South Africa to help disadvantaged young people get the training and preparation needed for jobs in growth industries. The second sub-initiative works in India to establish accessible financial services for urban families living in poverty.\n\nRecent grantees of the family economic stability programs include India’s Arthan Finance, the South African digital training platform WETHINKCODE and Amazi, a South African organization that provides women with training for jobs in the beauty industry.\n\nGrants for Economic and Community Development, and Texas\n\nIn addition to its global development focus, the economic mobility program also runs sub-initiatives that are exclusive to Central Texas. The Jobs & Livelihoods and Family Economic Stability initiatives “fund programs that connect people of all ages to skills training and job placement, support micro-entrepreneurs, and link families with local resources.”\n\nThe Dell Foundation also supports the nonprofit community in Central Texas and helps “organizations build capacity and work more effectively.”\n\nGrants for Health and Public Health\n\nDell’s Health Innovation initiative supports health, mental health, medical research and wellness across the U.S. as well as in Greater Austin. This program works broadly across many areas of health and healthcare, with the overarching mission statement to “create a new type of health system that is designed to improve health and not just health care… through the use of technology, collaboration, and research.”\n\nFunding has overlapped somewhat with Dell’s urban education grantmaking, focusing on services and wellness education provided at or through schools.\n\nGrantees have included charter school networks, which have used funding to establish school-based counseling, mental health and health screening programs.\n\nThe program also supports nutrition education programs. One grantee, Foodcorps Inc., a subsidiary of Americorps, used funding to run its school-based nutrition and gardening programs.\n\nThe health and wellness program also runs sub-initiatives that are exclusive to Central Texas. These programs emphasize preventive medicine, primary care and high-quality professional development for the medical community in greater Austin. Grantees include the Texas Health Institute, the People’s Community Clinic and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nImportant Grant Details:\n\nThe Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has made over $100 million in grants annually in recent years, with grants ranging from a few thousand to several million. Its average grant size is about $400,000.\n\nGrantmaking is generally limited to the U.S., India and South Africa, and much of U.S. funding remains in Texas.\n\nFor a clearer picture of past grantmaking, see the foundation’s grants database at its website.\n\nThe Dell Foundation accepts unsolicited applications for some of its education, health and economic development subprograms. See the foundation’s guidelines and FAQ sections for additional information.
