        "text": "Liz Schoenfeld, Ph.D. and the team at LifeWorks Austin connect Austin youth with housing, counseling, education, and job training so they can build stable, fulfilling lives. Since 1999, the organization has supported 100,000+ youth — and prioritized client feedback to ensure the programs meet their needs. So, when parents explained the difficulty of bathing children in a shower, Lifeworks adjusted the plan and scope for its new apartment complex to include bathtubs. By sharing their expertise and getting what they need, young people are empowered to transform Austin's future. #AcceleratingAustin\n\nIn high school, Diana realized she wanted to pursue #nursing and decided to explore her options through real-world experience. Through a partnership with Alliance of Community Assistance Ministries, Inc., Diana enrolled in a certified nursing assistant (CNA) course with MAM Houston - Memorial Assistance Ministries, which helped her boost her interview skills, connect with employers, and quickly land a job as a patient care associate. Now that Diana has experience working in nearly every hospital unit, she plans to complete her nursing degree and specialize in eldercare. “I'm the first person in my family to work in the medical field,” she says. With Diana’s encouragement, her sister became the second person in the family when she completed her own certification through MAM. ➡️ Learn more about how ACAM supports bright young people like Diana: https://msdf.co/3Wgji7M\n\nIndia is home to more than 11 million nano enterprises — a subset of small businesses that are vital to the country’s economic growth.
