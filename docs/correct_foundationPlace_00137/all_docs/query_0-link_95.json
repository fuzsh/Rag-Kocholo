        "text": "APF is Proud to Again Be A Beneficiary of This Amazing Event!\n\nAustin Parks Foundation is honored to be one of the local charity beneficiaries for the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play (DTMP). The tournament brings 64 top-ranked, professional golfers from around the world, right here to Austin and has generated more than $2 million in charitable proceeds in just two years. These proceeds benefit various local charities including Austin Parks Foundation (APF), Boys and Girls Club of the Austin Area, The First Tee, Helping Hand Home for Children, and Keep Austin Beautiful. Austin Parks Foundation was announced as a beneficiary during last year’s inaugural event, and proceeds from the 2016 tournament were invested directly into Colony Park District Park. With these funds, we built three fitness plazas, allowing for free access to outdoor exercise and fitness opportunities that would ordinarily be found in commercial exercise centers.\n\nThis partnership with Dell Technologies and the Match Play tournament means, we can work together to strengthen Austin’s park system and enhance parks that the community will cherish. This year’s proceeds will help fund additional fitness-centric and physical activity projects including fitness equipment in parks around Austin. Our goal is to encourage recreation for all ages and abilities so that we can support health and wellness in our community. We are proud to continue to work with Dell Technologies to support health and wellness in the Austin community through the improvement of city parks.\n\nWe want to thank everyone who was a part of this year’s Dell Technologies Match Play. Whether you were a fan, spectator, sponsor, or volunteer, you played a part in making Austin a better place to live and visit. Thank you for supporting us and our fellow Match Play beneficiaries."
