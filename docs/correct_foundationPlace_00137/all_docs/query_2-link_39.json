        "text": "Governor Greg Abbott today announced that the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation will be collaborating with the OneStar Foundation to form a relief fund for Hurricane Harvey victims called the Rebuild Texas Fund. The Dell Foundation will be contributing $36 million to the fund with a long-term vision for the recovery of the affected areas. Those wishing to donate to the fund can do so by visiting www.rebuildtx.org or by texting ‘rebuildtx’ to 91999. The Governor joined Susan and Michael Dell on Good Morning America this morning to announce the creation of the Rebuild Texas Fund and to encourage people across the country to donate.\n\n\"As Texas begins its efforts to restore its communities in the aftermath of Harvey, I am proud to announce that the Dell Foundation is partnering with the OneStar Foundation to establish the Rebuild Texas fund,\" said Governor Abbott. \"Over the past week we have seen Texans and Americans come together to assist in the relief and recovery efforts and I have no doubt that this generosity will extend to this fund. I thank Michael and Susan Dell for their commitment to the State of Texas and to all those affected by Hurricane Harvey.\n\n\"Seeing the way Texans have stepped up to help their fellow Texans in the aftermath of this storm is truly inspiring,\" Governor Abbott continued. \"This incredibly generous donation from The Dell Foundation, in partnership with the OneStar Foundation, and the incredible work of Michael and Susan Dell, is truly a blessing. This selfless gift is a true representation of the Texas spirit and will go a long way for those in need.\"\n\n“This is our home. And we know that it will take all of us working together, over the long term, to rebuild our Texas communities,” said Michael Dell, a Houston native and founder of the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, based in Austin. “The Rebuild Texas Fund will be a partnership among rally companies, community leaders and individuals to work alongside state and federal officials to provide an additional source of funding and ideas for recovery and rebuilding.”\n\nOneStar Foundation was created to support the State of Texas by strengthening the nonprofit sector, encouraging civic engagement through service and volunteering, promoting innovative strategies to address local issues and facilitating public-private partnerships to expand the reach of nonprofits.\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation (www.msdf.org) is dedicated to improving the lives of children living in urban poverty around the world. Headquartered in Austin, TX with satellite office in New Delhi, India and Cape Town, South Africa, the Dell family foundation funds programs that foster high-quality public education and childhood wellness, and improve the economic stability of families living in poverty. The foundation has committed more than $1.32 billion to global children's issues and community initiatives to date."
