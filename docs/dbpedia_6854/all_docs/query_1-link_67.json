        "text": "Peter Andre has admitted his family still can't talk about the sudden death of his brother Andrew over five years ago.\n\nAndrew Andre died in December 2012 after a 10-month battle with kidney cancer.\n\nAnd while appearing on stage at James Ingham’s Jog On To Cancer event in London's Café de Paris last night, Peter revealed cancer tore his family apart.\n\n\"I’m a very proud ambassador of Cancer Research UK since I lost my brother,\" he said.\n\n“It came out of the blue. He was healthy, he was active. But not only did he get this terrible disease but he lost his life shortly afterwards. And it tore us apart.\"\n\nAndrew, who was diagnosed with kidney cancer in February 2012, was understood to have been responding well to treatment before his situation worsened in the November.\n\nHis parents flew to the UK from their home in Australia to be at his bedside with his wife Magda and daughter.\n\nPeter was preparing for a show in Cardiff when he was told Andrew had taken a turn for the worse - he immediately cancelled his remaining tour dates this month to rush to his bedside.\n\nHe even moved Andrew into his Surrey home so he could receive specialised treatment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, West London.\n\nHe continued: “Early detection is key. Do I think my brother’s life would have been saved it was detected earlier? Sure.\n\n“The bigger picture here is that millions of people are going through this right now.\n\n“As a family, we’re still so devastated by this loss we can’t sit down as a family and talk about it because it’s still so raw.”\n\nHe added: “I remember when we first lost Andrew and Cancer Research got in touch to see if I wanted to get involved.\n\n“I told them, no! I was angry at cancer. I said I wouldn’t support something that took my brother’s life.\n\nBut then my brother Mike said to be, ‘Bro, you’re never going to get over it so you might as well get on with it.’\n\n“You’ve got to get on with it. In me something changed and I knew I wanted to be involved in the solution.”\n\nPete was left heartbroken when Andrew passed away with his family at his bedside.\n\nA spokeswoman said at the time: “Peter is devastated. He was very, very close to his brother.\n\n“This is the very first family member Peter has experienced losing. He just needs time to grieve.”"
