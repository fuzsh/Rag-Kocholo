        "text": "Peter Chuck is one of the first people Quinn meets in the military. Peter is a high school friend of the main protagonist Quinn Talen. During a fatal incident, he is turned and later becomes a Wight of the Cursed Family. He is Quinn's first Blooded and is latter his first dedicated follower. He is a God Slayer Level being when using his celestial energy. Probably Quinn’s most loyal follower and friend too, as he gives up his will to pursue that of Quinn’s.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPeter came from a relatively poor family. His Older sister was the hopes of his family and they spent years of saving to purchase a skill book for her. With the hopes of her being able to make some achievement to improve their living conditions. However, after his sister enter the Academy went on an assignment, she was killed. His Family didn't have enough money to purchase another skill book leaving his level at 1.\n\nAfter entering the Military School, when taking his ability level test he was introduced to Quinn Talen, Vorden Blade, Layla Munrow, and Erin Heley. After the test he was given a Earth Skill Book to master. Later, he ended up being roommates and friends with Quinn and Vorden. However, Since he had a ability level 1, he kept being weak point of the group. Being threatened and beaten by second years. Leading to a number of incidents and pushing Quinn into a red portal. In which, Vorden walking into in order to save Quinn. After exiting the portal, Vorden did not trust him and wanted to kill him.\n\nQuinn understanding his position still kept faith in Peter trying to find out what was going on behind the scenes. Later finding out he was forced to to work for General Duke. After, teaming up with Quinn, Vorden, Layla, and Erin on their class first assignment to hunt beast and get there crystals. Quinn and Peter spilt up at \"The Well\" where he was attacked by Second years and having their crystal stolen. Through raw determination Vorden and Layla, Erin found Peter dragging himself across the ground in a semi-conscious state trying to get the crystals back. Leading the group to forgive him using the only full stocked medical robot to save his life.\n\nAfter, Erin and Layla ran off to try and get the crystals back they were attacked by a Dalki. While in the Battle, Peter jumped in front of Quinn to take the Dalki's attack, leading him to suffer a Fatal wound. Quinn using the Blood Ritual skill managed to save his life turning him into a Vampire Ghoul. Leading him to have to eat a total of 7 different human flesh to evolve into a Wight. Changing his personality.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPeter looked more nervous than anyone there, he would constantly look around him and couldn't stop fidgeting. His body frame was quite small but it suited him, for he wasn't that tall either. At the soldier's call for new students, the nervous small Peter then stepped forward and he looked even worse than before. Quinn thought he looked bad but he looked to be in perfect condition if you were to compare the two. At least Quinn was able to stand up whereas Peter looked like he would fall over any second.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBecause Peter had no ability, he was afraid of the treatment he would get from the others. After being turned into a ghoul and later a Wight he has become someone without emotions other that rage and is fearless to the point he is able to kill someone.\n\nAbilities and Possessions[]\n\nMartial Arts[]\n\nAfter becoming a Wight, Peter sought the path of a close combat specialist. At first, he was reliant on his regeneration, but after fighting higher vampires and their subclasses, Peter realized his mediocre perspective and strived to improve his martial arts. He also choose his main weapons as tonfas.\n\nAbility[]\n\n[Former] Level 1[1][2] Earth Element: The standard Military offered ability book, monopolized and monitored by the Military. Commonly used by builder citizens to create architecture. As an elemental ability, it requires the usage of any of the user's four limbs. Peter uses his level 1 Earth to make usable hand weapons or bumps near the ground.\n\nLevel 1: Any physical contacted earth can be controlled and manipulated within the user's four limbs, each limb's touchable range. Didn't have the ability to extract earth from the ground, all the users could do was reform the earth in their hand, they could only control earth they were touching rather than the earth around them.\n\n[Current] Level 6[3][4] Transformation: With the transformation ability, one could alter their face, and look like another. This meant it was often used for infiltration or spying. The problem was whenever these people were discovered, they would nearly be killed in an instant due to the fact that transformation ability does not grant them any offensive capabilities at all, or even defensive. The higher the level, the more accurate the transformation, with level 5 being a nearly perfect duplicate of only the face. The transformation ability can also change the physical aspects of other limbs, singularly.\n\nThe transformation ability wasn't a popular ability with the general public. It gave the user nothing extra that could aid them in combat. Therefore, it was looked down upon by a lot of the people. Still, it did have its uses.\n\nThrough Quinn's system, Peter automatically learned the level 5 ability, resulting with the ability book disappearing in an instant.\n\n[5]At level 5, Peter was only able to imitate a person's facial structure. There wasn't anything Peter could do about a person's height or physical appearance. This also meant that he wouldn't be able to pretend to be a girl unless one had the same body type as his. A higher-level transformation ability would allow Peter to do this accomplish it, but this wasn't available on the market place.\n\n[4]At level 6, Peter was able to change his face and his body structure to match others. Unfortunately, the higher levels of abilities usually weren't available on the market places and were either sold at auction, privately, or he would have to find a teacher to improve.\n\nSoul Weapon[]\n\n(Item type) Transformation Mask[]\n\nThe Transformation Mask can be used by anyone. If someone is wearing the mask, only Peter can change their appearance into whatever he desires. If the mask is destroyed, he can make a new one, but only one at a time. During the mask's effect, Peter can also transform into the same appearance.\n\nThe mask was a flimsy-looking thing, completely black in colour and looked more like an entire face mask one would use to keep their skin smooth and moisturized. When the holder looked down to touch it and have a look, the mask suddenly jumped up and stuck onto the holder's face, moulded to the face, and the holder looked like his or her regular self. Peter then places his hand on top of the holder's face, he closed his eyes and tried to picture someone, transforming based on his will.\n\n[4]Ex: With Logan in the room, + a transformed Quinn and Peter = the triple Logans.\n\nSubclass Category B:[6][]\n\nVampire Ghoul → Wight:[]\n\n→ Stats Comparable to His Creator (& feel His Creator's growth)\n\nAbsolute obedience to His Creator\n\nSuper human strength\n\nSuper human regeneration\n\nIncrease in Speed\n\nIncrease in Reflexes\n\nUnaffected by Sunlight\n\n[0/7 feed your ghoul (Peter Chuck) seven different types of human flesh][7]\n\n→ Eidetic memory to learn and improve[8]\n\n→ Can turn a dead person/vampire into a lesser Wight (0/4)[9]\n\nBeast Weapon[]\n\nTonfa x2 (Basic) - Logan Green Made[8]\n\nA Tonfa was a device similar to a baton, a long, blunt object, but there would be a side handle, willing a part of it to be used as a support. Rather than swing around a baton-like so, it felt more like a natural part of one's hands.\n\nTrivia[]"
