        "text": "A dozen years in the making, the long-awaited new U.S. Postal Service facility in downtown is slated to open in mid-January, the agency announced.\n\nThe new facility at 229 W. Genesee St. will supplant and greatly surpass the current branch on the first floor of the U.S. Court House. on Niagara Square.\n\nFifty-eight employees, all current Postal Service personnel, will staff the new facility.\n\nThe new branch is located about an eighth of a mile southwest of the current location, and is one block southwest of City Hall. Total cost of the project was $3.16 million.\n\nThe new building more than doubles the size of the current leased space, 20,980 square feet versus 9,575 square feet. The new post office branch also will feature 39 parking spaces, an amenity the current location does not offer.\n\nThe 229 W. Genesee site also features more than three times the number of office boxes, 744 versus 244, along with 30 parcel lockers, and several stamp vending machines. The new branch also is handicapped accessible.\n\nBut the new location's biggest plus may be the way it does business. It is one of the first branches in the country to feature the Postal Service's so-called postal store. In addition to offering customers the usual windowed counters, the new facility will feature such merchandise as stamp sheets, rolls and coils and other products in pre-packaged containers. The containers will be accessible to \"shoppers\" who will select what they want and then bring it to the \"check-out\" counter.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"People can actually touch stamps,\" said Victor Laudisio, customer relations coordinator for the Postal Service's Buffalo District. \"Before everything was locked up behind the counter or in stamp machines. It will be no different than going to Kaufmann's.\"\n\nThe store is designed to speed up transaction time and cut the long lines branches are known for. The postal store will offer counters specifically for its transactions and also will feature a lobby director, who will answer questions and direct customer traffic.\n\n\"It's the browse-and-shop concept,\" Laudisio said.\n\n\"The postal store service concept has been piloted in other cities with great success,\" said Nicholas A. Fabozzi, Buffalo's postmaster. \"Our objective is to make doing business with us more convenient, easier and faster.\" Fifty such postal shops are in operation nationwide, with 1,000 planned.\n\nThe saga of the Genesee Street branch began a dozen years ago, when an initial space survey was conducted by the Postal Service.\n\nMore than six years ago, the General Services Administration, the federal government's space procurement arm, formally asked the Postal Service to vacate its Niagara Square facility. Negotiations soon began to purchase the two-acre Genesee Street site, home of the Waterfront Racquet and Fitness Club.\n\nAs was the case with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Buffalo office and the local U.S. Attorney's office, the need for additional federal court space forced the Postal Service from Niagara Square.\n\nThe former racquet club was purchased 2 1/2 years ago and construction started 13 months ago.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
