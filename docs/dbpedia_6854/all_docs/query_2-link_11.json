        "text": "1866\n\nUS brothers Charles and George Page establish the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. Using the abundant supplies of fresh milk in Switzerland, they start Europe's first production facility for condensed milk. They sell the milk under the Milkmaid brand. It's marketed as a safe, long-life alternative to fresh milk.\n\n1867\n\nNestlé's founder, German-born pharmacist Henri Nestlé, launches his 'farine lactée' ('flour with milk') in Vevey, Switzerland. Combining cow's milk, wheat flour and sugar, the product is designed for infants who can't be breastfed, to tackle high mortality rates. Around this time he starts using the iconic 'nest' logo.\n\n1875\n\nHenri Nestlé, now in his 60s, sells his company and factory in Vevey to three local businessmen. They employ chemists and skilled workers to help expand production and sales.\n\n1878\n\nFierce competition develops between Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss. They are now selling rival versions of the other's original products: condensed milk and infant cereal. Both firms expand sales and production abroad.\n\n1882-1902\n\nIn 1882 Anglo-Swiss moves into the US, but the death of founder George Page slows down plans. In 1902 Anglo-Swiss sells its US-based operations, paving the way for an eventual merger with Nestlé.\n\n1904\n\nNestlé starts selling chocolate for the first time after taking over export sales for Peter & Kohler. In 1875, the Nestlé company also plays a role in developing milk chocolate by supplying Vevey neighbor, Daniel Peter, with condensed milk. Peter uses this in his trials to create the first milk chocolate to eat.\n\n1914\n\nWar breaks out across Europe and disrupts production for the company. The hostilities also drive demand for Nestlé dairy products, in the form of large government contracts.\n\n1915\n\nCondensed milk is long-lasting and easy to transport, which makes it popular with armed forces. In 1915 the British Army starts giving Nestlé canned milk to soldiers in their emergency rations. Strong demand for this product means that the company's milk refineries are working flat out.\n\n1916\n\nNestlé & Anglo-Swiss acquires Norwegian dairy company Egron. The business has patented a spray-drying process for producing milk powder, which Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss starts selling.\n\n1917-1918\n\nMilk shortages in Switzerland mean that Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss has to give its fresh milk supplies to help people in towns and cities. To meet the demand for condensed milk from the warring nations, the company buys US refineries and signs supply agreements with Australian companies, which it later acquires.\n\n1921-1922\n\nIn 1921, falling prices and high stock levels lead to the first, and only, financial loss for Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss. Banker Louis Dapples joins as crisis manager and encourages the company to appoint professional managers for the first time. Administration is centralized and all research is brought together at a laboratory in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\n1929\n\nThe company buys Switzerland's largest chocolate company Peter-Cailler-Kohler, the origins of which date back to 1819 when François Louis Cailler created one of the country's first chocolate brands, Cailler. Chocolate now becomes a large part of the Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss business.\n\n1934\n\nMalted chocolate drink Milo launches in Australia, and is later exported to other markets. The company continues to develop baby and infant foods and introduces Pelargon in 1934. This is a full-milk powder for babies, enriched with lactic acid bacteria to improve digestibility.\n\n1936\n\n1936 sees Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss transformed into a holding company with a dual geographical structure (Nesthold in Vevey and Unilac in Panama). Nestlé launches the vitamin supplement Nestrovit and, the following year, the innovative products Galak white chocolate and Rayon, a chocolate with honey and air bubbles.\n\n1938\n\nNescafé is launched as a 'powdered extract of pure coffee' that delivers coffee's natural flavor just by adding hot water. It's the brainchild of Max Morgenthaler, who created the product when the Brazilian government asked Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss to find an outlet for its huge coffee surplus.\n\n1939\n\nFearing that the Axis powers could occupy Switzerland, Nestlé & Anglo-Swiss relocates some managers to a new office in the US. This becomes the company's second headquarters during the war. The fighting makes it impossible for Nestlé to export milk from Europe, so the company supplies Africa and Asia from the US and Australia. It also expands into Latin America.\n\n1942-1945\n\nWWII initially slows sales of Nescafé, but they pick up as hostilities continue. When the US enters the war, Nestlé brands gain popularity among American service personnel. At the end of the war, Nescafé is included in CARE aid supplies in Japan and Europe. Following on from the success of instant coffee, Nestea is launched in the late 1940s.\n\n1947\n\nNestlé & Anglo Swiss merges with Swiss company Alimentana, which produces Maggi soups, bouillons and seasonings. It's renamed Nestlé Alimentana. Alimentana's history dates back to 1884, when Julius Maggi developed a protein-rich dried soup to tackle malnutrition.\n\n1948\n\nIn the US, Nestlé Alimentana launches a soluble tea, Nestea. This is manufactured in the same way as Nescafé and can be served hot or cold. Nesquik, which dissolves easily in cold milk, is also launched in the US and becomes a top seller.\n\n1954\n\nNestlé infant cereal has been around since 1948 as a powdered product, but it's now rebranded as Cerelac. In addition, Maggi's seasoning brand, Fondor, launches a powder alongside its original bouillon cube. Packaged in a convenient shaker, it can be used as a condiment in the dining room, as well as in the kitchen.\n\n1957\n\nCanned ravioli is launched under the Maggi brand. Its huge success prompts Nestlé to launch more canned, prepared foods. This becomes a new growth segment for the business.\n\n1960\n\nWith more households buying freezers, demand for ice cream is rising. Nestlé buys German producer Jopa and French manufacturer Heudebert-Gervais to capitalize on this growth. It also adds Swiss brand Frisco to the mix in 1962. Nestlé brand acquisitions continue with the purchase of UK canned foods company Crosse & Blackwell.\n\n1962\n\nNestlé buys the Findus frozen food brand from Swedish manufacturer Marabou, and takes the brand to international markets. In 1945, Findus becomes one of the first companies to sell frozen foods in Europe.\n\n1968\n\nAs chilled dairy products are increasingly popular, Nestlé buys French yogurt producer Chambourcy. In the early 1970s Chambourcy launches the Sveltesse range of yogurts, aimed at health and weight-conscious consumers.\n\n1969\n\nTo add to the acquisitions, Nestlé enters mineral waters by buying a stake in French water brand Vittel.\n\n1973\n\nKeen to bolster its canned foods and frozen portfolio in Anglo-Saxon markets, Nestlé takes over the US frozen foods company Stouffer Corporation. Three years later, it buys canned foods producer Libby, McNeill & Libby.\n\n1974\n\nFor the first time in its history, Nestlé diversifies beyond food and drink. It becomes a minority shareholder in global cosmetics company L'Oréal.\n\n1977\n\nRenamed Nestlé S.A., the company continues its diversification strategy, buying US pharmaceutical and ophthalmic products manufacturer Alcon Laboratories. Declining breast-feeding rates lead some activists to question the baby food marketing strategies of companies like Nestlé. In 1977 they call on people to boycott Nestlé products.\n\n1981\n\nStouffer's Lean Cuisine frozen meals are launched on a low-fat, low-calorie platform, which creates impressive sales. Nestlé and L'Oreal establish Galderma as a joint venture in dermatology. Plus, the World Health Assembly adopts the WHO code on breast-milk substitutes, which Nestlé applies across the business.\n\n1985\n\nBy acquiring US-based Carnation Company for USD 3 billion, Nestlé adds brands such as Carnation and Coffee-Mate to its portfolio. It also enters the pet food business when it buys the Friskies brand.\n\n1986\n\nThe Nespresso story begins with a simple idea: enable anyone to create a perfect cup of coffee, just like a skilled barista. People across Japan, Italy and Switzerland are given this opportunity in 1986 when Nespresso officially launches.\n\nRead more: Calling coffee pilgrims everywhere! Nespresso\n\n1988\n\nNestlé buys UK confectionery company Rowntree Mackintosh, adding brands like KitKat, After Eight and Smarties to its portfolio. It also acquires Italian pasta, sauce and confectionery group Buitoni-Perugina.\n\n1991\n\nNestlé creates a joint venture with General Mills, Cereal Partners Worldwide, to produce and market breakfast cereals globally. The company also joins forces with The Coca-Cola Company to form Beverage Partners Worldwide. This paves the way for the manufacture and marketing of brands including Nestea.\n\n1992\n\nIn 1992, Nestlé develops its position in mineral waters by acquiring France's Perrier Group.
