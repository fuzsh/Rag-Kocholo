        "text": "Policies & Procedures\n\nAcademic Standards and Actions\n\nGrading Practices\n\nGrades given to record academic performance in SCS are detailed under Grading Practices at Undergraduate Academic Regulations.\n\nDean's List WITH HIGH HONORS\n\nSCS recognizes each semester those undergraduates who have earned outstanding academic records by naming them to the Dean's List with High Honors. The criterion for such recognition is a semester quality point average of at least 3.75 while completing a minimum of 36 factorable units and earning no incomplete grades.\n\nAcademic Actions\n\nIn the first year, quality point averages below 1.75 in either semester invoke an academic action. For all subsequent semesters an academic action will be taken if the semester quality point average or the cumulative quality point average (excluding the first year) is below 2.00.\n\nProbation: The action of probation will be taken in the following cases based on QPA:\n\nOne semester of the first year is below 1.75 QPA;\n\nThe semester QPA of a student in good standing beyond the first year falls below 2.00.\n\nThe term of probation is one semester as a full-time student. First year students are no longer on probation at the end of the second semester if the second semester's QPA and the cumulative QPA is 1.75 or above. Students in the third or subsequent semester of study are no longer on probation at the end of one semester if the semester QPA and cumulative QPA (excluding the first year) are 2.00 or above.\n\nProbation Continued: A student who has had one semester on probation and is not yet meeting minimum requirements but whose record indicates that the standards are likely to be met at the end of the next semester of study may be continued on probation, based on advisor recommendation. This action is normally taken only when a student's semester QPA is above 2.0 but their cumulative QPA is not yet above 2.0.\n\nSuspension: A student who does not meet minimum standards based on QPA at the end of one semester of probation can be suspended:\n\nA first year student will be suspended if the QPA from each semester is below 1.75.\n\nA student on probation in the third or subsequent semester of study will be suspended if the semester QPA is below 2.00.\n\nThe minimum period of suspension is one academic year (two non-summer semesters). Suspension is meant to allow a student to take a pause from their academic studies to address the issues that are causing poor academic performance. At the end of that period a student may return to campus (on probation) by:\n\ncompleting a Return from Leave form from the HUB and submitting this form to their academic advisor, and\n\nsubmitting an additional written statement to their academic advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, minimum one page, that outlines what the student did while on leave to address the issues that led to the suspension and that would indicate future success on return, and\n\n(optional) submitting up to two letters of support from individuals supporting the student's return to the academic advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs.\n\nUpon review by the student's academic advisor and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, in consultation with the Office of Student Affairs and the Office of International Education as appropriate, the student may be approved to continue their studies.\n\nStudents who have been suspended or have withdrawn are required to absent themselves from the campus (including residence halls and Greek houses) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified. This action includes debarment from part-time or summer courses at the university for the duration of the period of the action. Although suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic suspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university. Students on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not.\n\nDrop: This is a permanent severance. Students who have been suspended and who fail to meet minimum standards in the subsequent semester(s) after they return to school on probation will be dropped from the School of Computer Science. Students who have been dropped and are not admitted to another program at the university are required to absent themselves from the campus (including residence halls and Greek houses) within a maximum of two days after the action.\n\nAppeal: Students may appeal a suspension or drop decision in writing within 10 business days of notification if, under consultation with their academic advisor, they feel that the decision was made in error and they have additional information that would indicate that they can continue in the next semester and exit their probationary status. Instructions on the appeal process are given in the suspension letter that is sent to the student.\n\nOther Actions: In addition to academic actions based on QPA, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs may place students on probation, subsequent suspension or drop, if they do not demonstrate reasonable progress through the core curriculum of their major (e.g., not completing a core class after 3 attempts, not completing the required 100-level core courses by the end of the sophomore year, etc.). Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor about any concerns with regard to lack of progress in their chosen SCS major to determine if any course drop or withdrawal will lead to an action.\n\nThe relation indicated above between probation, suspension and drop is nominal. In unusual circumstances, SCS College Council may suspend or drop a student without prior probation.\n\nLeave of Absence and Return from Leave of Absence\n\nSCS undergraduate students may elect to take a leave of absence for a variety of reasons, after consultation with their academic advisor. Students who wish to take a leave of absence must do so by the last day of classes before final exams begin and before final grades are posted (in case this is earlier). Students requesting a leave of absence must complete a form from the HUB and have this signed by their academic advisor and SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Students who take a leave of absence up to the last day to drop classes will have all of their classes dropped. Students who take a leave of absence after the last day to drop classes will be assigned a grade of W (withdrawal) for all of their classes.\n\nStudents returning from a leave of absence are required to submit a Return from Leave of Absence form to their academic advisor for approval by the student's academic advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. In addition, for students taking a leave for academic reasons, the student must also supply a letter that explains the reason for the leave, the actions that were performed during the leave to prepare the student for a successful return, and a description of the on-campus resources, if required, that would be used by the student in order to increase the likelihood of success. Students returning from a leave are also encouraged to provide up to two letters of support from people close to the student (e.g. family, friends, clergy, teachers, coaches, others as appropriate). Requests to return are reviewed by the student's academic advisor, the Associate Dean and the Student Affairs liaison to determine eligibility and any resources that need to be put into place to assist the student upon return. Contact the SCS Undergraduate Office (GHC 4115) for more information.\n\nInternal Transfer within SCS\n\nFirst year students admitted to SCS are considered undeclared during their first year. These students declare their SCS major in the middle of the second semester of their first year of study. SCS students who wish to transfer from one SCS major to another SCS major may do so by applying for transfer by mid-semester break during the semester the transfer is desired (or the end of the summer session for summer transfers). These students should consult with their academic advisor and the program director of the intended major for more information about specific course requirements and academic plans. Internal SCS transfers do not have any grade requirements. Transfers are approved based on demonstrated interest, ability, and available space in the intended major. Consult the website for the individual SCS major for more information about expected courses to take to demonstrate interest and ability. The transfer request form is available on the SCS website.\n\nTransfer into SCS / Dual-Degree\n\nUndergraduate students admitted to colleges at CMU other than SCS and wishing to transfer to SCS or pursue a dual degree in SCS should consult with the Director or Program Coordinator of the desired SCS major during their first year. See the individual program pages for the names of the current directors and program coordinators, along with their contact information.\n\nFor the Artificial Intelligence primary major, students must complete 15-122, 15-150, 15-281, 10-315, one of 15-210, 15-213 or 15-251, and one of 36-225, 21-325, 36-218 or 15-259, with an expected overall QPA over these six courses of 3.6 or higher.and an overall QPA of at least 3.0, in order to be considered for transfer or dual degree.\n\nFor the Computational Biology primary major, students must complete 21-127 (or equivalent), 15-122, 15-251, 15-351 (or 15-210*), 03-121 and either 02-251 or 02-250 with an expected overall QPA over these six courses of 3.6 or higher and an overall QPA of at least 3.0, in order to be considered for transfer or dual degree. (*Students who take 15-210 will need to also take 15-150; this course is not required for the B.S. in Computational Biology but can count as an elective.)\n\nFor the Computer Science primary major, students must complete 21-127 (or equivalent), 15-122, 15-150, 15-210, 15-213, 15-251 with an expected overall QPA over these six courses of 3.6 or higher and an overall QPA of at least 3.0, in order to be considered for transfer or dual degree.\n\nFor the Human-Computer Interaction primary major, students must complete 21-127 (or equivalent), 15-122, 15-150, 05-410, one of 15-210 or 15-213, and one of 05-470 or 05-651, with an expected overall QPA over these six courses of 3.6 or higher and an overall QPA of at least 3.0, in order to be considered for transfer or dual degree.\n\nFor the Robotics primary major, students must complete 21-127 (or equivalent), 15-122, 15-213, 15-251, one of the following robotics courses: 16-211, 16-299, 16-311 (or Robot Building when launched), and one of 36-225, 21-325, 36-218 or 15-259, with an expected overall QPA over these 6 courses of 3.6 or higher and an overall QPA of at least 3.0, in order to be considered for transfer or dual degree.\n\nStudents may apply for transfer by the start of the mid-semester break in the semester when the final course(s) of the six required courses will be completed (or the end of the summer session for summer transfer requests). In the case of course(s) in progress, the mid-semester grades will be used in the QPA calculation. The decision to allow transfer or dual degree will be made by committee based on the student's academic performance (in the specified courses and in their courses overall if necessary), additional involvement in SCS and other computing-related activities, and availability of space in the student's class level. Students should consult the SCS Undergraduate Office for complete information concerning minimum requirements, instructions and deadlines.\n\nExternal Transfer\n\nA student currently enrolled at another university or college who wishes to transfer to SCS should first apply through the Office of Admission. If the Office of Admission believes the applicant meets admission guidelines, the student's record is sent to SCS for evaluation. Admission is based on seat availability, overall academic performance and course rigor from the student's current institution, ability to complete the rigorous SCS program on time, and the application material including recommendations and reflection essay(s). It is important to note that extremely few external transfers are admitted to the SCS program at Carnegie Mellon University due to space limitations.\n\nGraduation Requirements\n\nA requirement for graduation is the completion of the program specified for a degree with a cumulative quality point average of 2.00 or higher for all courses taken at CMU. (Students who start their undergraduate study at CMU may meet this requirement without the first year of study, if necessary.)\n\nStudents must be recommended for a degree by the faculty of SCS.\n\nA candidate for the bachelor's degree must complete at the University a minimum of four semesters of full-time study, or the equivalent of part-time study, comprising at least 180 units of course work.\n\nStudents will be required to have met all financial obligations to the university before being awarded a degree.\n\nA student who does not meet the QPA requirement above must petition SCS College Council for a waiver of the first requirement.\n\nGeneral Education Requirements\n\nAll undergraduate degrees in the School of Computer Science include depth in their particular field of study but also breadth through the general education requirements. General education requirements are part of SCS degrees to give students an opportunity to learn more about the world from scientific and humanistic points of view. These additional skills are useful for graduates since computing is often embedded in domains that are not entirely within the bounds of computing. SCS students will need to use their computing skills to solve problems alongside scientists and engineers, artists, social and cognitive scientists, historians, linguists, economists and business experts, and SCS students will need to communicate effectively and understand the ethical implications of their work. The general education requirements help SCS students gain this broad perspective so they can work well in a wide variety of domains.\n\nScience and Engineering\n\nAll candidates for a B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science must complete a minimum of 36 units offered by the Mellon College of Science and/or the College of Engineering (CIT).\n\nComputational Biology majors\n\nFor Computational Biology majors, consult the Computational Biology program page for specific science and engineering requirements. The required science and engineering courses for the Computational Biology major also satisfy the General Education requirement for SCS by default.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction majors\n\nFor Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction majors, four courses in science and engineering are required, 9 units or more for each course, at least one course must have a laboratory component and at least two courses must be from the same department. Consult with your SCS undergraduate advisor for possible use of any mini course for this requirement which needs to be reviewed by your advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs.\n\nNon-lab courses that are usually taken by AI, CS and HCI majors to satisfy this requirement are given in the list below. (Consult your academic advisor for additional choices available each semester.)\n\n02-223Personalized Medicine: Understanding Your Own Genome\n\n(can be paired with a course in Biology 03-xxx for two courses in one department)9 03-121Modern Biology9 03-125Evolution9 03-132Basic Science to Modern Medicine9 03-133Neurobiology of Disease9 06-100Introduction to Chemical Engineering12 09-105Introduction to Modern Chemistry I10 09-106Modern Chemistry II10 09-217Organic Chemistry I9 09-218Organic Chemistry II9 09-225Climate Change: Chemistry, Physics and Planetary Science9 12-100Exploring CEE: Infrastructure and Environment in a Changing World12 12-201Geology9 18-095Getting Started in Electronics: An Experiential Approach9 18-100Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering12 18-220Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits12 18-240Structure and Design of Digital Systems12 24-101Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering12 24-231Fluid Mechanics10 24-261Mechanics I: 2D Design10 24-291-24-381Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet -

Some of the courses taught in these units are considered technical courses and may not be used to satisfy this requirement (see Deletions below). Additionally, a select set of courses from Business Administration and from Environmental and Public Policy can also count for this requirement (see Additions below). Students may combine humanities/arts courses with lower units together to form a single course of 9 units or more. Students are encouraged, but not required, to take courses from different departments to gain additional breadth and to create new opportunities for engagement with the university community.\n\nDeletions\n\nSome courses from the Dietrich College or the College of Fine Arts may not count toward the unconstrained electives in Humanities and Arts in SCS due to the technical (computing and/or mathematical) nature of the courses. Courses from the following departments do not count toward the unconstrained Humanities and Arts electives:\n\nStatistics and Data Science (36), except 36-303 Sampling, Survey and Society\n\nInformation Systems (67)\n\nEconomics (73), except 73-102 Principles of Microeconomics and 73-103 Principles of Macroeconomics\n\nAdditionally, the following courses do NOT count toward the unconstrained Humanities and Arts electives:\n\n51-257Introduction to Computing for Creative Practices10 51-327Design Center: Introduction to Web Design9 51-328Design Center: Design for Digital Systems9 76-388Coding for Humanists9 76-481Introduction to Multimedia Design12 76-487Web Design12 80-210Logic and Proofs9 80-211Logic and Mathematical Inquiry9 80-212Arguments and Logical Analysis9 80-305Game Theory9 80-310Formal Logic9 80-311Undecidability and Incompleteness9 80-315Modal Logic9 80-316Logic and AI9 80-325Foundations of Causation and Machine Learning9 80-405Game Theory9 80-411Proof Theory9 80-413Category Theory9 80-419Interactive Theorem Proving9 80-514Categorical Logic9 80-521Seminar on Formal Epistemology: Belief and EvidenceVar. 85-219Foundations of Brain and Behavior9 85-310Research Methods in Cognitive Psychology9 85-314Cognitive Neuroscience Research Methods9 85-414Cognitive Neuropsychology9 85-426Learning in Humans and Machines9 88-251Empirical Research Methods9 88-372Social and Emotional Brain9\n\nAdditions\n\nThe following courses outside of Dietrich College and the College of Fine Arts may count toward the unconstrained Humanities and Arts electives:\n\n11-423ConLanging: Lrng.

This would be no later than the junior year and can begin even earlier. Students interested in graduate school in computer science or its related areas are strongly encouraged to participate in the SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis program. Additionally, graduate CS courses can be taken with permission of the instructor and in consultation with an academic advisor.\n\nThe goal of the SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis Program is to introduce students to the breadth of tasks involved in independent research, including library work, problem formulation, experimentation, analysis, technical writing and public speaking. In particular, students write a short paper summarizing prior results and current progress in their desired area of research, present a public poster session in December of their senior year describing their current progress, present their final results with a poster and an oral presentation in the year-end university-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium (Meeting of the Minds) and submit a written thesis at the end of their senior year. Students work closely with faculty research advisors to plan and carry out their research. The 07-599 SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Students should prepare their research prospectus (i.e. proposal of work) during the spring semester of their junior year, and students in this program are advised to plan their schedules carefully to ensure there is ample time to perform the required research for the thesis during the senior year.\n\nStudents interested in research are urged to consult with their undergraduate advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs no later than the end of their sophomore year in order to plan their workload effectively. Although there is no specific QPA requirement to participate, students are expected to have at least a 3.5 QPA in the core SCS topics relevant to their proposed research to be successful in their work. For those students with no background in research, they may consider using 07-300 Research and Innovation in Computer Science (9 units) as an introduction to the research process in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science and important skills that are needed to be an effective researcher. This course leads to a subsequent research practicum, 07-400 Research Practicum in Computer Science (12 units), that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use this practicum to start their senior thesis can use the units toward the required 36 units. Students should consult with their academic advisor concerning how the units earned toward the senior thesis can be used toward elective requirements for their major.\n\nInterested juniors should submit a project prospectus of 3-4 pages by the end of their junior year, although submissions over the summer prior to the senior year will also be considered for review. A prospectus must include:\n\nThe name of the research advisor (an SCS faculty member)\n\nA short abstract (two paragraphs, max)\n\nA description of the problem to be worked on and its significance\n\nA tactical description of the proposed research plan, including:\n\na description of the background reading to be carried out,\n\na description of the research contribution,\n\na description of the expected results of the research, and\n\na reasonably detailed timeline for the thesis work\n\nA bibliography of related work (all references belong here)\n\nThe signature of the research advisor, signifying endorsement of the project and willingness to supervise and evaluate it (or an email confirmation from the research advisor)\n\nStudents who need help finding potential advisors should get in touch with their academic advisor or the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Applications to the program are due by the start of the senior year, although submission of applications in the junior year is encouraged.\n\nStudents completing an outstanding senior thesis based on the judgement of the SCS Undergraduate Review Committee will earn SCS College Honors and can compete for various SCS research awards given out during commencement."
