        "text": "What's Amazing Spider-Man #1 worth in 2024?\n\nThe value of Amazing Spider-Man #1 in Mint condition has tripled in value in the last 10 years. Currently, Amazing Spider-Man #1 holds the record of the most expensive book that has ever sold in the comic book market. Recently, a 9.6 appeared for sale in the market and it was sold for an enormous $336,000 in November 2022. While back in 2005 - 2007, copies were only going for $100,000. Since most collectors can’t afford NM+ copies, let’s look at mid grade (FN 6.0) and low grade (GD 2.0) copies instead. You could have purchased in FN 6.0 back in 2007 for a measly $4,000. That same copy would now sell for $20,000! A very nice 400+% increase in value in a dozen years. In GD 2.0, it’s much the same story. In 2007, you could have picked up a low grade copy for $1,000. Nowadays, the entry fee is $6,000 to acquire a readable, complete copy. For big key issues like Amazing Spider-Man #1, we recommend you pick up a low grade copy that looks nice and hold onto it for the long haul.\n\nWhy is this comic book valuable?\n\nFollowing the huge success of Amazing Fantasy #15, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko began a new ongoing series named “The Amazing Spider-Man” in 1963. Amazing Spider-Man #1 introduces J. Jonah Jameson and Spider-Man’s first villain - Chameleon. To add more gravitas to the issue, Lee and Ditko brought over the Fantastic Four to guest star. #1 issues always hold their value for popular characters and although this wasn’t Spider-Man’s first appearance, it did let the world know that the Amazing Spider-Man was here to stay!\n\nPrice Guide Report\n\nGD 2.0 VG 4.0 FN 6.0 VF 8.0 NM 9.4 RECORD SALE! $7,900 $15,000 $27,000 $40,000 $241,200 $336,000\n\nWhat's Amazing Spider-Man #2 worth in 2024?\n\nThe value of Amazing Spider-Man #2 in Mint Condition has remained pretty stable over the past 10 years. In 2007, a CGC NM+ 9.6 copy sold for $72,000. 8 years later, in 2015, a CGC NM+ 9.6 copy sold for $72,895. That's not much of an increase in value over 8 years. In the affordable grades, it's value has risen steadily. In 2007, you could acquire a low grade copy for $400. Now that same low grade copy would fetch over double that at $850! The same trend holds if you are looking at mid grade (FN) copies. 10 years ago, you could have purchased a nice mid grade copy for $1,000. In today's market, it sells for nearly $3,500! So, If you're looking to buy a copy, we recommend you purchase a low to mid grade copy (GD 2.0 to FN 6.0) and wait for price appreciation!\n\nWhy is this comic book valuable?\n\nAmazing Spider-Man #2 features the very first time the Vulture appears in comic books. The Vulture is one of Spider-Man's main enemies and a member of the Sinister Six. He was portrayed by Michael Keaton in the movie Spider-Man: Homecoming. This issue is also the 3rd appearance of Spider-Man in comic history.\n\nPrice Guide Report\n\nGD 2.0 VG 4.0 FN 6.0 VF 8.0 NM 9.4 RECORD SALE! $1,200 $1,900 $3,800 $8,500 $40,000 $168,000\n\nWhat's Amazing Spider-Man #3 worth in 2024?\n\nThe value of Amazing Spider-Man #3 in Mint condition has remained relatively stable over the years. In 2007, you could have picked up a CGC NM+ 9.6 copy for about $40,000. Today, you might be able to buy a copy for $55,000. Mid and lower grade copies have done much better due to their affordability. In 2007, a FN 6.0 copy could be purchased for $1,000 but today you will need to spend $5,000 for that same grade. Low grade copies (GD 2.0) have gone up in value from $300 in 2007 to $1,700 today. We recommend you pick up a nice mid grade copy with no marvel chipping (link) and hold on for the ride!\n\nWhy is this comic book valuable?\n\nDr. Octopus, Spider-Man’s most popular arch-nemesis (and most infamous), is introduced in issue #3. In the Marvel Universe, EVERYONE is affected by radiation (including Spider-Man) and Dr. Octopus begins his reign of terror in the same way, after being bombarded with radiation after a nuclear accident. The accident fuses his arms to his body, messes with Doc Ock’s mind and brings a whole new challenge to the web slinger. He also becomes the leader of the Sinister Six (link).\n\nPrice Guide Report\n\nGD 2.0 VG 4.0 FN 6.0 VF 8.0 NM 9.4 RECORD SALE! $1,700 $2,200 $5,500 $7,500 $35,000 $144,000\n\nWhat's Amazing Spider-Man #4 worth in 2024?\n\nIn Mint condition, Amazing Spider-Man #4 is very rare and scarce. There are only 3 copies in CGC NM+ 9.6 according to the CGC census (link). The last (and only) public sale of a CGC NM+ 9.6 was back in 2011 for $77,000. Recently, A 9.6 Twin Cities pedigree appeared in the market and was sold for a new high of $174,000 in 2021. In low to mid grades, this issue is much more common. In 2007, FN 6.0 copies were selling for $600. Today, you’ll pay about $3,500 for the same graded copy. That’s about a 350% increase. In low grade (GD 2.0) in 2007, copies were selling for $150. Now, the price of a GD 2.0 copy will bring $900 or so. That is another 350% increase. You can’t go wrong with buying a nice copy of this issue, so if you’re looking for one, make sure it has bright colors and no marvel chipping (link).\n\nWhy is this comic book valuable?\n\nAnother radiation accident creates another great villain for Spidey - The Sandman! The Sandman’s ability to become sand at a moment’s notice makes him nearly indestructible. The Sandman is a member of the Sinister Six (link).\n\nPrice Guide Report\n\nGD 2.0 VG 4.0 FN 6.0 VF 8.0 NM 9.4 RECORD SALE! $900 $1,275 $3,500 $6,500 $45,000 $174,000\n\nWhat's Amazing Spider-Man #8 worth in 2024?\n\nIn 2018, a CGC NM+ 9.8 of this issue sold for $23,400 in 2021 which is by far the most expensive Amazing Spider-Man #8 has ever sold for. Later in June 2022, The same 9.8 reappeared but it went for $21,600 which shows that this book has had a slight depreciation. Moreover, In 2002 you could get a FN 6.0 for around $200, climbing to its current value of $700. A GD 2.0 went for $60 in 2003 and now has a value of $250.

Spidey’s popularity is so strong the issue could easily fetch several thousand more dollars in just 4 years later! In 2021, the same comic broke all the records as it was sold for an enormous price tag of around $210,000 in September 2021. Certainly one of the most sought after issues in any grade you will find this book a very stable investment in any condition.
