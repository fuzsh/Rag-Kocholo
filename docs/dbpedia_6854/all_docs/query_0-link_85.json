Taxonomic Considerations\n\nFerrets (Mustela putorius furo) belong to the ancient family Mustelidae, which is believed to date back to the Eocene period, some 40 million years ago. The taxonomic groups in the family Mustelidae, as recognized by Corbet and Hill (1980), include 67 species from North, Central, and South America, Eurasia, and Africa. No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rain forests. Mustelids have retained many primitive characteristics, which include relatively small size, short stocky legs, five toes per foot, elongated braincase, and short rostrum (Anderson, 1989). The Mustelinae is the central subfamily of the Mustelidae. The best-known members of the Mustelinae are the weasels, mink, and ferrets (genus Mustela) and the martens (genus Martes) (Anderson, 1989). The genus Mustela is divided into five subgenera: Mustela (weasels), Lutreola (European mink), Vison (American mink), Putorius (ferrets), and Grammogale (South American weasels).\n\nAccording to one author, ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have been domesticated for more than 2000 years (Thomson, 1951). Earlier references to ferrets are probably the basis of the belief that ferrets originated in North Africa (Thomson, 1951). Evidently they were bred specifically for rabbiting (rabbit hunting) and were muzzled before being sent into rabbit burrows. This practice was later introduced into Europe, Asia, and the British Isles, where the sport is still practiced today.\n\nAlthough the ferret has been historically used for hunting, more recently it has been increasingly used in biomedical research and is popular in North America as a pet. It is most likely a domesticated version of the wild European ferret or polecat (M. putorius or M. furo) (Thomson, 1951). Alternatively, it may be related to the steppe polecat (M. eversmanni), which it closely resembles in skull morphology (Walton, 1977). The domesticated ferret, although introduced to North America by the early English settlers some 300 years ago, has not established feral colonies on this continent.\n\nB. Use in Research\n\nThe ferret was not recognized as having potential as an animal model for biomedical research until the 1900s. Early studies utilized the ferret in classic experiments with influenza virus pathogenesis (Pyle, 1940). Its use was cited infrequently; an article published in 1940, detailing the use of ferrets in research, cited only 26 publications (Pyle, 1940). Literature reviews undertaken in 1967, 1969, 1973, and 1985, however, revealed an increasing appreciation for the ferret's usefulness and versatility in the study of human physiologic, anatomic, and disease mechanisms (Hahn and Wester, 1969; Marshall and Marshall, 1973; Shump et al., 1974; Frederick and Babish, 1985). In 1991, a bibliography containing “selected” literature citations on the ferret and its use in biomedical research was published (Clingerman et al., 1991). The document was designed to serve as a reference tool for individuals involved in the care or use of ferrets in the laboratory setting. Although not comprehensive, the document provides extensive coverage of ferret biology, diseases, and use as an animal model. The domesticated ferret has been and continues to be used extensively in studies involving virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, and endocrinology, as well as other areas of biomedical research (Morgan and Travers, 1998). The ferret is also being used to replace the cat in some types of neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and cardiology experiments.\n\nC. Availability and Sources\n\nThe ferret's increasing popularity in research and as a pet is mainly a result of large-scale commercial production. For example, commercial farms have been raising ferrets for almost 50 years. Biomedical researchers in the United States can request animals of a specific sex, weight, and age for individual experiments. Investigators in other countries may acquire ferrets from fur operations or may make arrangements with commercial vendors in the United States. Even though the ferret is nonstandardized with regard to exact genotype and pedigree, its routine availability in a clinically healthy state has aided immeasurably its acceptance as a research animal. Readily available commercial stocks, based on coat color, are albino, sable (or fitch), Siamese, silver mitt, and Siamese-silver mitt (Siamese with white chest and feet) (McLain et al., 1985). The fitch or so-called wild coat color is the most common, recognized by yellow-buff fur with patches of black or dark brown, particularly on the tail and limbs (Andrews and Illman, 1987). The production of ferrets by large commercial operations has raised concern by some that inbreeding of these animals has made the ferret more susceptible to diseases, e.g., endocrine-related disorders.\n\nD. Laboratory Management and Husbandry\n\nThis topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 21.\n\n1. Housing and Husbandry\n\nHousing of ferrets in a research facility is similar to that of other small carnivores such as cats (Fox, 1998c). Ferrets tolerate low temperatures well and high temperatures poorly; the recommended temperature range for juvenile and adult animals is 4–18°C (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972). Ferrets less than 6 weeks of age should be housed at > 15°C. Kits under this age require a heat source if separated from the dam; older kits that are group-housed do not. Elevated temperatures (>30°C) cannot be tolerated by ferrets, because they have poorly developed sweat glands and are susceptible to heat prostration. Signs of hyperthermia include panting, flaccidity, and vomiting. The preferred humidity is 40–65%.\n\nFor nonbreeding animals that will remain in the facility for a short time, a conventional dark-light cycle at 12:12 hr is adequate. Lighting may be altered to control breeding cycles. Breeding and lactating jills should be exposed to 16 hr of light daily. Ferrets that are maintained for breeding or for use beyond 6 months should be exposed to “winter” light—6 weeks per year of 14 hr of dark daily—to maintain physiologic normalcy. It is also essential that researchers receiving time-pregnant jills preserve the photoperiod to which jills were exposed prior to shipment. Failure to do so may cause inappetence, with subsequent negative energy balance and pregnancy toxemia.\n\nSimilar to other laboratory animal species, ferrets should be housed with 10–15 air changes per hour (USDHHS, 1996). It is important to use nonrecirculated air because of the strong odor of ferrets and the susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. The ferret odor should not overlap into any rodent housing areas, because rodents have an instinctive fear of ferrets, and the ferret scent can disrupt rodent breeding and physiology (Fox, 1998c).\n\n2. Caging\n\nFemale ferrets can be housed singly or in groups, but estrous females that are cohoused may become pseudopregnant (Beck et al., 1976). Males should be housed individually after 12 weeks of age.\n\nMolded plastic caging used to house rabbits works very well for ferrets. The solid bottom is perforated with holes and is readily sanitizable. An absorbable paper liner may be used in the pan beneath the cage to facilitate daily disposal of urine and feces. In a research setting, the plastic caging should be washed weekly to avoid excessive soiling. The spacing of grid walls should be 1.0 × 0.5 inches apart, or 0.25 inch if using wire mesh. Ferrets like to lick and bite at their enclosures, so sharp edges and galvanized metal should be avoided. Zinc toxicosis has been reported from licking galvanized bars from which metals had leached during steam sterilization (Straube and Walden, 1981) ( ).\n\nTable I\n\nParameterCommentCage size24 × 24 × 18 inches (adequate for two adult ferrets)Grid size1 × 0.5 inches (0.25 inch if wire mesh or slated flooring)Temperature range4°–18°C (40°-64.5°F); animals less than 6 weeks (>15°C; 60°F)Humidity range40–65%Air handling10–15 complete air changes/hr (nonrecirculated)Animals amenable to group/pair housing\n\nFemale ferrets\n\nAnestrous\n\nNonlactating\n\nWeanling ferrets\n\n4–12 weeks old\n\nMales separated at 12 weeks\n\nPhotoperiod (hours light : hours dark)\n\nBreeding; lactation (16:8)\n\nWinter cycle (10:14)\n\nNonbreeders housed for <6 months (12:12)\n\nDiet (protein source: meat)\n\nNonbreeding adult males and females: 18–20% fat, 30–40% protein\n\nBreeding males and females: Minimum 25% fat, minimum 35% protein\n\nPeak lactation: 30% fat minimum, 35% protein\n\nFeeding scheduleAd libitumQuantity consumed (dry-weight basis)43 gm/kg body weightWater consumption (adults)75–100 ml daily\n\nFerrets can be trained to use a litter box because they repeatedly urinate or defecate in one corner of the cage. Clay litters have been reported to cause chronic upper respiratory irritation from inhaled dust (Jenkins and Brown, 1993). Ferrets prefer sleeping in a soft isolated area, and in a research facility this can be accomplished by providing a washable “snooze tube” (Fox, 1998c).\n\nII. BIOLOGY\n\nA. Unique Anatomic and Physiologic Characteristics\n\nThe thorax of the ferret is narrow and elongated, and as a result the trachea is proportionally long. This makes the ferret an ideal species for studies of tracheal physiology. The tracheal size and laryngeal anatomy make endotracheal intubation somewhat challenging, and as a result the ferret has been advocated as a species suitable for use in pediatric intubation training (Powell et al., 1991). The lungs are relatively large, and the total lung capacity is nearly 3 times that which would be predicted based on body size, as compared with other mammals. This characteristic, together with a higher degree of bronchiolar branching and more extensive bronchial submucosal glands (as compared with the dog), makes the ferret an attractive model for pulmonary research studies (Vinegar et al., 1985). Although a previous report (Willis and Barrow, 1971) commented that the carotid arterial branching pattern in the ferret is unusual, it is actually typical for a carnivore. As is the case in the dog and the cat, the paired common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk (sometimes called the innominate artery) at the level of the thoracic inlet (Andrews et al., 1979b).\n\nThe ferret's gastrointestinal tract is specialized to fit its carnivorous nature. The simple monogastric stomach is similar to that of the dog. There is no cecum present, and the indistinct ileocecal transition makes it difficult to identify the junction of the small and large intestines during a gross examination. The overall length of the alimentary tract is very short relative to the body size, resulting in a gastrointestinal transit time as short as 3 hr (Bleavins and Aulerich, 1981).\n\nAs in other mustelids, the paired anal scent glands of the ferret are well developed. Although not as potent as those of the skunk, the secretions of the ferret are sufficiently odoriferous that many pet or research ferrets are descented. Surgical techniques for this procedure have been described (Creed and Kainer, 1981; Mullen, 1997). Ferrets, especially intact males and estrous jills, may possess a distinctive musky odor even after a successful descenting, because of normal sebaceous secretions. Ferrets lack well-developed sweat glands for use in thermal regulation, and as a result they are predisposed to heat prostration when ambient temperatures reach 32°C (90° F) (Ry-landeia et al., 1983).\n\nExtramedullary hematopoiesis is commonly found during histological examination of the spleen, and in some cases it may result in a grossly evident splenomegaly (Erdman et al., 1998). This must be differentiated from splenomegaly that can arise from a variety of pathologic conditions or from isoflurane administration (see Section III,E). Experimental evidence suggests that ferrets have no naturally occurring antibodies against unmatched erythrocyte antigens, and that none develop even in the face of repeated transfusions (Manning and Bell, 1990b).\n\nFerrets are seasonal breeders, and the resulting pronounced physiological variations in body weight, behavior, and gametogenesis are utilized in scientific studies of photoperiod responses and neuroendocrine control. Prolonged estrus in unbred females can cause an aplastic anemia, an effect that can be reproduced with exogenous estrogen administration (Bernard et al., 1983). The male has a radiographically evident os penis, and, contrary to some earlier reports, a prostate gland is present in males (Evans and An, 1998).\n\nB. Normal Values\n\nNewborn ferret kits weigh 6–12 gm at birth and will grow to 400 gm by the time they are weaned at 6–8 weeks (Shump and Shump, 1978). In sexually intact populations, males (1.0–2.0 kg) can be twice the size of females (0.5–1.0 kg). The adult weight of nonobese male and female ferrets that have been gonadectomized prior to weaning and raised in captivity will generally fall between 0.8 and 1.2 kg (Brown, 1997a). Adult animals (especially those that are sexually intact) may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in body fat percentage, which can cause body weight to fluctuate by 30–40% (Fox and Bell, 1998). The approximate life span for the ferret is 6–8 years, but on rare occasions they may live as long as 11 years ( ).\n\nTable II\n\nParameterValueLife span (average)5–11 yearsBody temperature38.8°C (37.8°–40°C)Chromosome number (diploid)40Dental formula2 (I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/3, M 1/2)Vertebral formulaC7T15L5S3C14Age of sexual maturity4–12 monthsbLength of breeding life2–5 yearsGestation42 ± 2 daysLitter size8, average (range, 1–18)Birth weight6–12 gmEyes open34 daysOnset of hearing32 daysWeaning6–8 weeksWater intake75–100 ml/24hrUrine volume26–28 ml/24 hrUrine pH6.5–7.5Cardiovascular/respiratory Arterial blood pressure Mean systolicFemale 133, male 161 mmHg (conscious) Mean diastolic110–125 mmHg (anesthetized) Heart rate200–400 beats/min Cardiac output139 ml/min Circulation time4.5–6.8 sec Respirations33–36/min\n\nNormal hematology and serum chemistry values have been reported for the ferret (Thornton et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1982; Fox, 1998e). These values are not greatly dissimilar from those of other domestic carnivores. One distinctive hematological characteristic of the ferret is the presence of a relatively robust erythron, characterized by hematocrit, hemoglobin, and total erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts that are generally higher than those of the dog or cat. Reported neutrophil–lymphocyte ratios range from 1.7:1 to 0.7:1. Representative hematology and chemistry ranges from one of our studies (Fox et al., 1986b) are shown in and , but for diagnostic purposes any laboratory that evaluates ferret samples should develop its own set of specific normal ranges. A low-grade proteinuria may be identified by urinalysis in normal, healthy ferrets (Thornton et al., 1979) ( ).\n\nTable III\n\nParameter (unit)Observed rangeWBC (103/mm3)1.7–13.4RBC (103/mm3)9.7–13.2Hematocrit (%)47–59Hemoglobin (gm/dl)14.5–18.5Total protein (gm/dl)6.2–7.7Neutrophils (%)22–75Bands (%)0–2Lymphocytes (%)20–73Monocytes (%)0–4Eosinophils (%)0–3Basophils (%)0–1\n\nTable IV\n\nMean ± SEMSerum analyte (unit)Observed rangeaFemalebMalebGlucose (mg/dl)99–135104.9 ± 16.4104.0 ± 15.0Urea nitrogen (mg/dl)11–2533.3 ± 7.622.0 ± 6.3Creatinine (mg/dl)0.3–0.80.40 ± 0.100.40 ± 0.10Sodium (mEq/liter)152–164150.4 ± 1.50154.4 ± 3.60Potassium (mEq/liter)4.1–5.24.90 ± 0.304.90 ± 0.20Chloride (mEq/liter)118–126117.1 ± 1.90112.5 ± 9.10Calcium (mg/dl)7.5–9.99.0 ± 0.309.5 ± 0.60Phosphorus (mg/dl)4.8–7.66.70 ± 0.606.70 ± 1.20Alanine aminotransferase (IU/liter)78–149150.3 ± 49.3157.6 ± 79.9Aspartate aminotransferase (IU/liter)57–248NDc101.0 ± 35.25Alkaline phosphatase (IU/liter)31–6644.3 ± 11.352.4 ± 11.6Lactate dehydrogenase (IU/liter)221–752ND434 ± 113.5Sorbitol dehydrogenase (IU/liter)ND2.6 ± 2.25.4 ± 4.5Protein, total (gm/dl)5.0–6.86.0 ± 0.55.9 ± 0.3Albumin (gm/dl)3.3–4.23.8 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.1Cholesterol (mg/dl)119–209174.0 ± 43.5156.0 ± 37.0Triglycerides (mg/dl)10–32ND18.5 ± 5.1Bilirubin, total (mg/dl)0–0.1ND0.55 ± 0.225Uric acid (mg/dl)0.7–2.7NDNDGlobulin (mg/dl)1.8–3.1NDNDCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter)16–28NDND\n\nTable V\n\nUrine analyteUnitsFemaleaMaleaVolumeml/24 hr8–1408–48pH6.5–7.56.5–7.5Proteinmg/100 ml0–327–33Sodiummmol/24hr0.2–5.60.4–6.7Potassiummmol/24 fu-0.9–5.41.0–9.6Chloridemmol/24 hr0.3–7.50.7–8.5\n\nC. Nutrition\n\nFerret diets have been formulated both empirically and based upon the nutrient requirements of other mustelids (Fox and McLain, 1998). Specific requirements for various life-cycle stages have not been determined experimentally. Available commercial diets are certainly capable of supporting growth, reproduction, and maintenance in conventional settings. In the absence of careful analysis, however, it is uncertain whether the proportion and quantity of ingredients in these diets is optimal.\n\nFerrets are strict carnivores with a high requirement for dietary fat and protein. Their short digestive tract and rapid gastrointestinal transit time (3–4 hr) require protein to be readily digestible. There is general agreement that ferrets should not be given diets high in complex carbohydrates or fiber. Diets that are high in fish products are also not recommended for ferrets (Fox and McLain, 1998). The use of any raw chicken, beef, or other meats is strongly discouraged because of the potential contamination by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus (Fox, 1998a). Daily maintenance energy consumption for ferrets is 200–300 kcal/kg body weight. Calorie-percent protein ratios have been determined for mink (Mustela vison) kits up to and after 16 weeks of age (Sinclair et al., 1962; Allen et al., 1964). A ratio of 13 and a caloric density of 550 kcal/100 gm of feed, corresponding to 42% protein, provided optimum growth for male kits up to 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, ratios of 17 and 21, corresponding to 36% and 26% protein, respectively, were recommended. Diets containing 9–28% fat and 22–42% carbohydrate have been used successfully to maintain ferrets. One author recommends 30–40% protein and 18–20% fat for adult, nonbreeding animals and a minimum of 35% protein and 25% fat for reproductively active animals and those that have not reached sexual maturity (Brown, 1997a). The long-term impact of diets containing high levels of fat and protein are unknown.\n\nFerrets have been used to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and interaction of the dietary micronutrients β-carotene and vitamin E. Ferrets, like humans, convert β-carotene to vitamin A in the gut and absorb β-carotene intact (Fox and McLain, 1998). In intestinal perfusion experiments in ferrets, it was demonstrated that β-carotene, retinol, and retinyl esters are absorbed intact into lymph and that cleavage products, including β-apo-12′-carotenal, β-apo-10′-carotenal, and retinoids, accumulate in the intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 1992). The intestinal mucosa is capable of converting β-carotene into retinoic acid and other polar metabolites, which are then transported via the portal vein to the liver (Wang et al., 1993). β-Carotene absorption is enhanced by co-perfusion with α-tocopherol, and the perfusion of the latter is unaltered by the presence of β-carotene. The conversion of β-carotene into retinol is also enhanced by the presence of α-tocopherol (Wang et al., 1995). These and other findings have established the ferret as an important model for the study of these antioxidants.\n\nAdult ferrets drink 75–100 ml of water daily, depending on the dry-matter content of the feed (Andrews and Illman, 1987). Fresh water can be provided ad libitum in stainless steel bowls or water bottles with sipper tubes. Ferrets are playful and will overturn bowls or water bottles that are not well secured.\n\nD. Reproduction\n\n1. Reproductive Physiology\n\nFeatures of ferret reproduction may be found in . Female ferrets are seasonal breeders and induced ovulators. The season under natural illumination in the Northern Hemisphere is from March to August for females and from December to July for males, corresponding temporally to increasing day length. Ferrets born in the late spring or early summer and maintained under natural lighting will not assume an adult pattern of gonadal activity (i.e., puberty) until the following season (Baum, 1998). Under artificial illumination, jills that are maintained at 8 hr light-16 hr dark reach puberty at 10–12 months. Stimulatory photoperiods may be used, however, in the laboratory or intensive production setting, as a method of breeding ferrets out of the natural season. However, the transfer from short to long photoperiods should not occur prior to 90 days of age, because jills that are prematurely transferred will remain anestrous (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972). Management practices in one breeding facility are such that jills commence breeding at 7–10 months, average 3.7 litters a year, and are cycled out of reproduction after 6 litters. In another strategy, ferrets are exposed to a 16:8 hr photoperiod at 12 weeks of age, are bred at 16 weeks during their first estrus, and whelp at 5½ months. Vulvar swelling is the hallmark of estrus in jills. The ease with which estrus is detected in the ferret, as well as the size of the ferret and ease of its maintenance in captivity have made the ferret a model for study of neuroendocrine events and their gonadal correlates. Along with the hamster, the ferret has contributed extensively to an understanding of the photoperiodic influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Baum, 1998). As in females of other species, estradiol concentrations are responsible for controlling the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics, and the tonic inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary during both prepubertal life and anestrus. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic gonadostat to negative feedback inhibition by estradiol changes at the time of puberty, and under the influence of increasing light exposure, LH levels rise despite estradiol (Ryan, 1984). Similarly, age differences in the sensitivity of negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by testosterone, or to estrogenic compounds derived from the aromatization of testosterone, appear to be essential in determining puberty and seasonality of reproduction in the male (Baum, 1998).\n\nTable VI\n\nParameterValueAge at puberty Female (adult, range 750–1500 gm)6–12 months Male (adult, range 1500–2500 gm)6–12 monthsMinimum breeding age8–12 months (male); 4–5 months (female)Estrous cyclebMonestrus, March through AugustcDuration of estrous cycleContinuous until intromissionType of ovulationInduced by copulationOvulation time30–40 hr after matingNumber of ova12 (range, 5–13)Copulation timeUp to 3hrSperm deposition sitePosterior os cervixOvum transit time5–6 daysViability of sperm in female tract36–48 hrCleavage to formation of blastocoeleUniform rateImplantation12–13 daysGestation period42 ± 1 daysImplantation-parturition30 ± 1 daysLitter size8 average (range, 1–18)Size at birth6–12gmReturn to estrusNext March,b occasionally postpartum estrusSolid food eaten3 weeks, before eyes are openBreeding life of female2–5 yearsBreeding life of male5+ yearsBreeding habitsOne male to several females; in colony production\n\n2. Detection of Estrus and Pregnancy\n\nEstrus in jills is characterized by dramatic vulvar swelling from an anestrous diameter of 5–16 mm to an estrous diameter of 17–33 mm. Changes in vaginal cytology have also been described for the ferret and other mustelid species, but these changes are seldom used to determine onset of estrus or to schedule breeding (Williams et al., 1992). After a 2- to 3-week proestrus, estrus occurs. Estrus onset is not associated with elevated serum FSH in the ferret, as it is in the rodent. Once estrus has occurred, it may terminate in coitus-induced ovulation and pregnancy, pseudopregnancy after infertile mating, pharmacologic termination (by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH), death due to estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, or spontaneous remission and anestrus due to reduced photoperiod. Waves of follicular development occur in estrus, and 5–13 ova are ovulated approximately 30–40 hr after coitus. Female ferrets are brought to the male approximately 14 days after vulvar enlargement. Females and males copulate many times and for prolonged periods of time; they are typically left together for 2 days. Both intromission and neck restraint by the male are apparently required for induction of ovulation (Baum, 1998). An LH surge accompanies coitus in females, but the same is not true of males (Carroll et al., 1987). Implantation occurs 12 days after mating; both a functional corpus luteum and the anterior pituitary are required for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation is typical of carnivores and is zonary and endotheliochorial (Morrow, 1980). Pregnancy may be detected by ultrasonographic demonstration of 3–5 discrete nonechogenic structures as early as day 12 (Peter et al., 1990), by palpation as early as day 14, or by radiographic demonstration of calcified fetal skeletons at approximately 30 days of gestation.\n\n3. Husbandry Needs\n\nJills within 2 weeks of parturition should be singly housed and provided with a secluded place in which to deliver their kits. When rabbit cages are used for housing, nest boxes may take the form of polypropylene rat cages or other plastic boxes (cat litter box or dishpan). Nest boxes should have bedding provided for warmth and comfort. Materials suitable for bedding include pieces of fabric (towels), ripped cageboard, shredded paper, or cotton batting. The nest box should be at least 6 inches deep and should prevent the kits from wandering from the jill. Entrance to the nest box should be smooth, to avoid injury to the teats and mammary gland. At our institution, jills are provided a stainless steel rectangular box with a smooth-surfaced plastic entrance ( ). A retractable steel roof panel and a guillotine side panel exposing a Plexiglas sidewall allow access to the jill and permit observation with minimal disturbance. One major supplier of ferrets uses sunken tubs filled with bedding to promote a sense of security and isolation of the jill. Most jills will leave the nest box to eat and drink. If the jill will not leave, however, low-sided food bowls should be placed within the nest box.\n\n4. Parturition\n\nParturition occurs rapidly in ferrets and may last as little as 2–3 hr. Primiparous jills typically deliver on day 41 of gestation whereas multiparous jills deliver on day 42. There are few signs of impending parturition, although abdominal enlargement and mammary development do occur in the last week or two. Small litters (fewer than three) may result in inadequate stimulus for parturition. Jills that pass their due date without delivery should be palpated for fetuses. Kits remaining in utero beyond the 43rd day typically die; kits with congenital malformations such as cyclopia and exencephaly may also delay the initiation of labor. Dystocia is common in ferrets because of positional abnormalities and fetal oversize and should be treated by cesarean section. Jills tolerate cesareans well and will nurse kits delivered in this way. If small litter size is responsible for delayed parturition, prostaglandins (0.5–1.0 mg Lutalyse) may be used, followed by 0.3 ml oxytocin (6 U) after 3 hr (Fox and Bell, 1998). Failure to deliver within 8 hr of administration of prostaglandin is an indication for cesarean section. Jills should be provided heat, energy, hydration, and analgesia following cesarean.\n\nKits will attempt to nurse soon after parturition, but jills experiencing difficult labor may not allow them to nurse until all kits are delivered. Jills that are not attentive to their kits should be palpated for the presence of additional, undelivered kits. Oxytocin may be used to facilitate delivery of remaining kits. Offering the jill regular chow mixed with warm water may promote maternal acceptance. Kits should be kept warm pending acceptance by the jill. Jills should be left undisturbed for the first several days postpartum to avoid their cannibalizing the litter. Cross-fostering to other jills may be successfully accomplished, provided that the kits are warm and that the foster jill has kits of similar age. Kits to be fostered should be allowed to mingle with the foster Jill's own kits while their dam is absent so that rejection due to olfaction will not occur.\n\n6. Sexing\n\nGender may be distinguished in neonatal ferrets, as in other species, by anogenital distance, with the distance being much shorter in females than in males. In males, the urogenital opening is seen just caudal to the umbilicus. The prominent midline raphe penis overlying the palpable os penis is also a distinctive feature in the male.\n\n7. Weaning\n\nFerrets are typically weaned at 6 weeks of age. Early weaning may be encouraged by making a slurry of the Jill's chow available at 3–4 weeks; fat may be added to achieve a fat content of 30%. The fatty acid supplement Linatone (Lambert Kay, Cranberry, New Jersey) is recommended by one author (Brown, 1997a). The diet should contain approximately 30% fat and 40% protein. The slurry should be fed twice daily for a restricted time and then removed to avoid having kits walking through and defecating in the diet. Unthrifty kits over 14 days of age may be supplemented with canine or feline milk replacers administered per os by Tygon-tipped Pasteur pipette (Manning and Bell, 1990a). Weaned ferrets are best housed in groups until sexually mature. Males over 12 weeks old may begin to fight if exposed to greater than 12 hr light per day.\n\nJills may return to estrus during the second or third week of lactation if they have fewer than 5 kits or 2 weeks after weaning if the litter is of normal size. Jills should be rebred or administered hCG to terminate estrus, even if still lactating. A high-quality, calorie-dense diet is required for lactation and to maintain pregnancy. If maintained on a stimulatory photoperiod and adequate nutrition, jills may have 2–3 liters of 6 or more kits yearly until they are 5 years old (Fox and Bell, 1998). A nonstimulatory photoperiod should be used 6 weeks per year to rest the ferret and preserve maximum fertility; a maintenance diet can be given at this time. Jills return to estrus approximately 3 weeks after reinstitution of the longer photoperiod.\n\n8. Artificial Insemination\n\nArtificial insemination is not commonly performed in ferrets but has been studied in the context of providing strategies for species perpetuation of the endangered black-footed ferret (Wildt et al., 1989).\n\n9. Synchronization\n\nSynchronization of estrus as practiced in rodent production is not used as a tool of reproductive management in the ferret. Synchronization of jills may be approximated, however, by manipulation of photoperiod. With natural illumination in outdoor housing, jills all come into estrus within a 1- to 2-week period (Baum, 1998). In the laboratory setting, when jills are maintained in a nonstimulatory photoperiod (8 hr light—16 hr dark) for 6–8 weeks, followed by reversal of the cycle (16 hr light-8 hr dark), estrus will follow in 4 weeks (immature jills) or 3 weeks (mature jills) after the change (Carroll et al., 1985). This correlates with follicular development and increased plasma estradiol.\n\nIII. DISEASES\n\nA. Infectious Diseases\n\n1. Bacterial Infections\n\nThe occurrence of infectious disease affects animal health and well-being and may complicate research efforts. A program combining good animal husbandry, optimal nutrition, health monitoring practices, and clinical care is essential to maintaining a healthy ferret colony.\n\na. Clostridium perfringens Type A\n\nEtiology.\n\nThe etiologic agent is Clostridium perfringens type A (Clostridium welchii).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nClostridium perfringens is ubiquitous and is present in the intestinal contents of humans and animals. Clostridium perfringens type A has been associated with the occurrence of acute abdominal distension, dyspnea, and cyanosis in weanling ferrets (Field and Laboratory Service Veterinary Staff, 1984) and an outbreak of gastroenteritis in weanling black-footed ferrets (Schulman et al., 1993). The exact cause of these conditions is uncertain, but predisposing factors such as overeating, sudden changes in diet, the proliferation of C. perfringens type A, and the production of overwhelming amounts of toxins are suspected (Field and Laboratory Service Veterinary Staff, 1984; Schulman et al., 1993). The alpha toxin is the principal lethal toxin. It is hemolytic and necrotizing and possesses the ability to split lecithin or lecithin-protein complexes, leading to destruction of cell membranes and subsequent necrosis. Reported cases have involved weanling animals exclusively.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nFerrets may present with acute abdominal distension, dyspnea, and cyanosis or may be found dead and bloated (Field and Laboratory Service Veterinary Staff, 1984; Schulman et al., 1993).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nIsolation of C. perfringens type A from gastric and small-intestinal contents is required. Toxin identification may be performed by the use of a mouse protection assay (Smith, 1975).\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nGross findings include markedly distended stomachs and intestines containing a large amount of gas and a moderate amount of brown, semiliquid ingesta, and subcutaneous emphysema with minimal or no putrefaction (Field and Laboratory Service Veterinary Staff, 1984; Schulman et al., 1993). Histologic findings observed in weanling black-footed ferret cases included the observation of abundant gram-positive bacilli in smears of gastric and intestinal contents. Other findings included varying degrees of gastrointestinal mucosal necrosis, numerous gram-positive bacilli lining the denuded mucosal surface and extending into the gastric glands and intestinal crypts; lymphoid necrosis of lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus; mild to moderate dilatation of central hepatic sinusoids with mild, acute, centrilobular hepatocellular dissociation and multifocal aggregates of small numbers of necrotic neutrophils within portal areas (Schulman et al., 1993).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nPrevention through good management and feeding practices is the primary means of control. In the reported cases of C. perfringens type A-associated gastroenteritis in black-footed ferret weanlings, supportive care and gastric trocharization were unrewarding. The occurrence of the condition was eliminated by restricting feeding of weanlings to twice a day instead of 3 times daily.\n\nb. Campylobacteriosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nCampylobacteriosis is caused by infection with Campylobacter jejuni.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nCampylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative, spirally curved microaerophilic bacterium that is recognized as a significant cause of human enteritis and is associated with diarrheic illness in several animal species, including dogs, cats, cows, goats, pigs, mink, ferrets, and sheep (Carter et al., 1995). It also known to cause mastitis in cows, infectious hepatitis of chickens, and abortion in cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and mink (Carter et al., 1995). The organism may also be cultured from the feces of normal asymptomatic dogs, cats, and ferrets (Fox et al., 1983; Carter et al., 1995).\n\nTransmission occurs by ingestion of organisms through direct contact with feces or contaminated food and water (Carter et al., 1995). There have been reports linking the disease in humans to pets. Many of these outbreaks were associated with dogs, puppies, and kittens recently obtained from animal shelters or pounds and displaying diarrhea before the human illness occurred (Fox et al., 1983). Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni from asymptomatic ferrets also implies a potential for zoonotic transmission (Fox et al., 1982, 1983).\n\nClinical signs.\n\nExperimental oral inoculation of ferret kits with various strains of C. jejuni produced a self-limiting diarrhea that ranged in character from very mild to watery (Fox et al., 1987; Bell and Manning, 1990a, 1991). The presence of mucus and/or blood was also noted in the feces of affected animals. Anorexia, dehydration, and tenesmus with watery diarrhea were also observed. Intravenous inoculation of 4 pregnant mink and 7 pregnant ferrets resulted in reproductive failure, ranging from fetal resorption to expulsion of dead or premature living kits (Bell and Manning, 1990b). Oral inoculation resulted in abortion in a majority of the infected animals (Bell and Manning, 1990b).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, and culture of affected animals. Reports of spontaneous cases in ferrets require diagnostic confirmation and differentiation from cases of proliferative bowel disease and other infectious and noninfectious causes of diarrhea. Campylobacter jejuni grows slowly and has specific culture requirements that involve the use of selective media or filtration techniques, and a requirement for thermophilic (42°–43°C) and microaerophilic conditions (Fox, 1998a). Cultures should be examined every 48 hours for round, raised, translucent, and sometimes mucoid colonies (Fox, 1998a).\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nStudies involving oral inoculation of ferrets with Campylobacter jejuni revealed small focal neutrophilic infiltrates in the lamina propria of the colon of relatively few infected animals (Fox et al., 1987). Bell and Manning (1991) noted mild to moderate enterocolitis with neutrophilic infiltration of the lamina propria, which was most severe in kits with concurrent cryptosporidiosis. Placentitis was the most notable histologic finding in pregnant ferrets and mink after experimental inoculation of a strain of an abortion storm-associated isolate of C. jejuni (Bell and Manning, 1990b).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nErythromycin is the drug of choice for treatment of human campylobacteriosis (Fox, 1998a). In a study to eliminate the carrier state in ferrets, erythromycin was ineffective even though in vitro isolates of C. jejuni were sensitive to the antibiotic (Fox et al., 1983). According to the author, reasons for therapeutic failure included dose selection, interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics and possible reinfection. Supportive care should be instituted, and choice of antibiotic therapy in confirmed diarrheic cases should be based on culture and sensitivity. In addition, because of its zoonotic potential, isolation of affected animals and good hygienic practices are recommended. Reculture of animals after treatment to ensure elimination of the organism is recommended.\n\nc. Helicobacter mustelae\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nIn 1985, a gastric Helicobacter-like organism was isolated from the margins of a duodenal ulcer of a ferret and named Helicobacter mustelae (Fox et al., 1986a, 1989a). Subsequently, in the United States, gastritis and peptic ulcers have been routinely reported in ferrets colonized with H. mustelae (Fox et al., 1988b, 1991a). Every ferret with chronic gastritis is infected with H. mustelae, whereas specific pathogen-free (SPF) ferrets not infected with H. mustelae do not have gastritis, gastric ulcers, or detectable IgG antibody to the organism (Fox et al., 1990, 1991a). Helicobacter mustelae has also been isolated from the stomachs of ferrets living in England, Canada, Australia and, most recently, from ferrets in New Zealand (Forester et al., 2000; Tompkins et al., 1988).\n\nKoch's postulates have been fulfilled: by oral inoculation of H. mustelae into naive ferrets uninfected with H. mustelae, the infection induced a chronic, persistent gastritis similar to that observed in ferrets naturally infected with H. mustelae (Fox et al., 1991b).\n\nIt is now known that H. mustelae colonizes nearly 100% of ferrets shortly after weaning. Feces from weanling and adult ferrets have been screened for the presence of H. mustelae to determine whether fecal transmission could explain the 100% prevalence observed in weanling and older ferrets (Fox et al., 1988b, 1992b). Helicobacter mustelae was isolated from the feces of 8 of 74 nine-week-old and 3 of 8 eight-month-old ferrets. Ferrets placed on proton pump inhibitors, which raise gastric pH, have a statistically higher recovery of H. mustelae from feces when compared with age-matched untreated control ferrets (Fox et al., 1993).\n\nClinial signs and pathology.\n\nHelicobacter mustelae–infected ferrets examined in our laboratory are usually asymptomatic. Ferrets with gastric or duodenal ulcers can be recognized clinically by vomiting, melena, chronic weight loss, and lowered hematocrit. Clinical signs in ferrets with H. mustelae–associated gastric adenocarcinoma have consisted of vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss, signs that may be confused with gastric foreign body.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nGastric and duodenal ulcers are observable endoscopically. It is interesting that the ferret is the only domesticated animal to date that has naturally occurring Helicobacter-associated ulcer disease. The H. mustelae isolated from ferrets has similar but not identical biochemical features to those of H. pylori, particularly in regard to the production of large amounts of urease. Gastric samples collected by endoscopy or necropsy are minced with sterile scalpel blades and inoculated onto blood agar plates supplemented with trimethoprim, vancomycin, and polymixin B (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas). The plates are incubated at 37° C or 42°C in a microaerobic atmosphere (80% N2, 10% H2, and 10% CO2) in vented jars for 3–7 days. Bacteria are identified as H. mustelae on the basis of Gram-stain morphology; production of urease, catalase, and oxidase; resistance to cephalothin; and sensitivity to nalidixic acid.\n\nNecropsy and findings.\n\nThe histopathological changes occurring in the stomach closely coincided in topography with the presence of H. mustelae (Fox et al., 1990). A superficial gastritis present in the body of the stomach showed that H. mustelae was located on the surface of the mucosa but not in the crypts. Inflammation occupied the full thickness of the distal antral mucosa, the so-called diffuse antral gastritis described in humans ( ). In this location, H. mustelae was seen at the surface, in the pits, and on the superficial portion of the glands. In the proximal antrum and the transitional mucosa, focal glandular atrophy, a precancerous lesion, and regeneration were present, in addition to those lesions seen in the distal antrum. Also, deep colonization of H. mustelae was observed focally in the affected antral glands.\n\nAnimals infected with Helicobacter spp. may also be susceptible to gastric cancer (Fox et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1995). There is recent documentation of the presence of argyrophilic bacteria, compatible in location and morphology to H. mustelae, within the pyloric mucosa of 2 male ferrets with pyloric adenocarcinoma (Fox et al., 1997). In humans, epidemiologic data strongly support the association between H. pylori and development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Similarly, we have recently documented a series of H. mustelae–infected ferrets with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that parallels the same syndrome found in humans. Lymphoma was diagnosed in the wall of the lesser curvature of the pyloric antrum, corresponding to the predominant focus of H. mustelae–induced gastritis in ferrets. Gastric lymphomas demonstrated characteristic lymphoepithelial lesions, and the lymphoid cells were IgG positive in all ferrets (Erdman et al., 1997). These findings and their parallels in H. pylori-infected humans implicate the involvement of H. mustelae in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer in ferrets.\n\nTreatment.\n\nStudies in ferrets indicate that triple therapy consisting of oral amoxicillin (30 mg/kg), metronidazole (20 mg/kg), and bismuth subsalicylate (17.5 mg/kg) (Pepto-Bismol original formula, Procter and Gamble) 3 times a day for 3–4 weeks has successfully eradicated H. mustelae (Otto et al., 1990). Clinical improvement, including increased appetite and resolution of melena, may occur within 48 hr of initiation of triple therapy. A new treatment regimen being used to eradicate H. pylori in humans has also been used successfully for eradication of H. mustelae from ferrets (Marini et al., 1999). Ferrets received 24 mg/kg ranitidine bismuth and 12.5 mg/kg clarithromycin per os 3 times daily for 2 weeks. Culture of tissue collected by gastric endoscopic biopsy at 16, 32, and 43 weeks after termination of treatment indicated that long-term eradication was achieved in all 6 ferrets. Eradication was associated with decrease in anti-H. mustelae IgG antibody titers, results that are consistent with findings in humans after H. pylori eradication.\n\nOmeprazole in ferrets at an oral dose of 0.7 mg/kg once daily effectively induces hypochlorhydria and may be used in conjunction with antibiotics to treat H. mwsielae-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers. Cimetidine at 10 mg/kg TID per os can also be used to suppress acid secretion. Acute bleeding ulcers must be treated as emergencies, and fluid and blood transfusions are essential.\n\nd. Proliferative Bowel Disease\n\nEtiology.\n\nProliferative bowel disease is caused by intracellular campylobacter-like organisms, closely related to Desulfovibrio spp., that are now classified as Lawsonia intracellularis in proliferative enteropathy of swine (Fox, 1998a). The organisms are gram-negative, comma- to spiral-shaped bacteria.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nProliferative bowel disease is a common clinical disease observed in young ferrets. Fecal-oral spread is suspected. The disease typically involves the large bowel, although it has been observed to affect the small bowel (Rosenthal, 1994). Campylobacter species, coccidia, and chlamydia have been isolated from some cases of proliferative bowel disease in ferrets (Li et al., 1996b). The role, if any, of co-pathogens in this disease is unclear.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nClinical signs include chronic diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss (which is often marked), and dehydration. Diarrhea may be blood-tinged, may contain mucus, and is often green in color. Rectal prolapse may be observed in affected animals. Ataxia and muscle tremors have also been observed (Fox et al., 1982).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs, a palpably thickened colon, and colonic biopsy. It is important to rule out other causes of diarrhea and weight loss through diagnostic tests that include but are not limited to a complete blood count, chemistry profile, radiographs, and fecal analysis and culture.\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nGross findings include a segmented, thickened lower bowel, usually the terminal colon but occasionally including the ileum and rectum (Fox et al., 1982; Fox, 1998a). Histologic examination consistently reveals marked mucosal proliferation and intracytoplasmic L. intracellularis demonstrated with silver stain within the apical portion of epithelial cells in the hyperplastic epithelial cells (Fox et al., 1982; Fox, 1998a) ( ). Other common histologic changes observed include the presence of a mixed inflammatory infiltrate that is variable in severity, reduced goblet cell production, hyperplasia of the glandular epithelium, glandular irregularity with penetration of the mucosal glands through the muscularis mucosa, and an increase in thickness of the tunica muscularis (Fox et al., 1982; Fox, 1998a). Translocation of proliferating glandular tissue to extraintestinal sites, including regional lymph nodes and liver, has been described in two ferrets (Fox et al., 1989b).\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nProliferative bowel disease should be differentiated from other diseases that may cause diarrhea and wasting, including dietary changes, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, gastric foreign bodies, lymphoma, Aleutian disease, and gastric ulcers (Bell, 1997b). A complete physical exam that includes palpation of the abdomen should reveal a palpably thickened intestine in cases of proliferative bowel disease.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nSupportive care, including fluid therapy and nutritional support, should be provided. Treatment with chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg BID PO, SQ, IM) or metronidazole (20 m/kg BID PO) for 2 weeks is reported to be effective (Krueger et al., 1989; Bell, 1997b). Clinical improvement may be apparent within 48 hr.\n\ne. Tuberculosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nTuberculosis can be caused by a variety of Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium bovis, M. avium, and M. tuberculosis.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nMycobacteria are aerobic, gram-positive, nonbranching, non-spore-forming, acid-fast rods. Natural infections with Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium have been reported in the ferret. Ferrets are also susceptible to experimental infection with human tubercle bacillus. Most reports of tuberculosis in ferrets are in animals that were used for research in England and the rest of Europe between the years of 1929 to 1953 and were likely related to the feeding of raw poultry, raw meat, and unpasteurized milk to ferrets during this time (Fox, 1998a). The feeding of commercially prepared diets and widespread tuberculosis testing and elimination in livestock and poultry have resulted in the reduced incidence of the disease in ferrets. Mycobacterium avium–infected wild birds shed the organism in feces; prevention of contamination of food and outdoor housing areas of ferrets is warranted.\n\nClinical signs and necropsy findings.\n\nClinical signs and lesions are dependent on the infective strain. Systemic infection with the bovine strain in ferrets results in disseminated disease with weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, death, and miliary lesions involving the lungs and other viscera (Fox, 1998a). Progressive paralysis has also been reported in a case of spontaneously occurring bovine tuberculosis in a ferret (Symmers and Thomson, 1953). Mycobacterium bovis lesions contain numerous acid-fast bacilli within macrophages with little cellular reaction (Fox, 1998a). In contrast, infection of ferrets with the human tubercle bacilli results in localized infection, often confined to the site of injection and adjacent lymph nodes; microscopically few organisms are observed. An impaired cell-mediated response may account for the large number of organisms observed in M. bovis lesions.\n\nVomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss were observed in a pet ferret with granulomatous enteritis caused by M. avium (Schultheiss and Dolginow, 1994). Granulomatous inflammation characterized by large numbers of epithelioid macrophages containing numerous acid-fast bacilli were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the jejunum and pylorus. Other sites of granulomatous inflammation included peripancreatic adipose tissue, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. A source of infection was not identified in this report. Pulmonary infection with M. avium has also been reported in 3 ferrets in a zoo in France (Viallier et al., 1983).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires isolation and identification of the organism from suspect tissue specimens. Great care should be exercised in handling suspect clinical specimens, and an appropriately equipped laboratory should be identified for culture and identification of the organism.\n\nAlthough there has been some experimental work in the area of the intradermal tuberculin skin-test response in ferrets and its apparent use in controlling tuberculosis in a breeding colony of ferrets, a tuberculin skin-testing regimen, including dose and type, has not been definitively characterized for clinical use in ferrets (Kauffman, 1981).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nBecause of the zoonotic risk, ferrets infected with M. bovis and M. tuberculosis should be euthanized (Fox, 1998a). Recurrent M. bovis infection involving the palmar aspect of the wrist of a 63-year-old man, which developed after he was bitten by a ferret at the age of 12, was reported and demonstrates the zoonotic potential (Jones et al., 1993). Mycobacterium avium infection is not reportable but may pose a risk to immunocompromised patients (Fox, 1998a). Personnel at risk should be followed up by a physician for appropriate diagnostic testing (Fox, 1998a).\n\nf. Salmonellosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nSalmonellosis is caused by infection with organisms of the genus Salmonella.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nSalmonella is a gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultative anaerobic rod in the family Enterobacteriaceae (Carter et al., 1995). Infection is by the oral route. Transmission may be direct from infected carrier animals or humans or through contaminated food products or water (Carter et al., 1995). Several Salmonella serovars have been isolated from mink with gastroenteritis and abortion (Gorham et al., 1949). Contaminated raw meat products were suspected as the source in one outbreak. Salmonella typhimurium was isolated in ferrets in an outbreak of clinical disease (Coburn and Morris, 1949) and several serotypes including S. hadar, S. enteritidis, S. kentucky, and S. typhimurium were isolated from the feces of ferrets surveyed in a research colony (Fox et al., 1988a).\n\nClinical signs and necropsy findings.\n\nClinical signs of an outbreak of S. typhimurium in ferrets included conjunctivitis, rapid weight loss, tarry stools, and febrile temperature fluctuations (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Gross findings in 2 ferrets 10 days after inoculation with S. typhimurium of ferret origin included marked tissue pallor, petechiae in the gastric mucosa, and the presence of melena in one and a dark-colored fibrinous exudate in the large intestine of the other ferret (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Studies involving experimental inoculation with S. enteritidis, S. newport, and S. choleraesuis via the oral route to healthy, distemper-infected, and feed-depleted ferrets and mink showed a fairly high resistance to infection (Gorham et al., 1949). Only 2 animals of 29 in the diet-restricted group—1 ferret and 1 mink—showed clinical signs of infection after feeding S. newport culture. Signs included lethargy, anorexia, trembling, and fecal blood. The gastrointestinal tract showed a large amount of mucus containing red blood cells; bits of desquamated epithelium and few mononuclear cells overlying the gastric mucosa; an exudate in the small intestine consisting of mucoid material, red blood cells, and desquamated small intestinal villi; edematous villi in the ileum; and a diffuse infiltrate of the small intestinal mucosa with lymphocytes and macrophages. Necrotic foci in the liver, spleen, and, less commonly, the kidney, as well as splenomegaly and visceral lymphadenopathy, were observed in chronic fatal infections (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Abortion and gastroenteritis have been reported in mink (Gorham et al., 1949).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, and isolation of the organism. The organism can be cultured on enrichment and selective media and then characterized serologically. Samples of blood, feces, exudates, tissues, and intestinal material may be cultured.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nCoburn and Morris (1949) treated 6 of 12 ferrets experimentally infected with S. typhimurium with sulfathalidine in the feed (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Salmonella typhimurium was isolated in 4 of 6 control animals and none of the treated animals 3 days after the administration of the last dose. Sulfathalidine was administered by the same authors to a colony of 77 ferrets in which an outbreak of salmonella occurred. The group was surveyed 2 days after sulfathalidine treatment and showed weight gain, improvement in condition, and a reduction in the number of Salmonella-infected ferrets (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Salmonella spp. isolated from ferrets may show resistance to a number of antibiotics (Fox, 1998a). Treatment includes appropriate use of antimicrobials and supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, nutritional support, maintenance of electrolyte balance, treatment of concurrent diseases, recognition of and attention to shock, and reduction of stress (Fox, 1998a).\n\ng. Pneumonia\n\nEtiology.\n\nStreptococcus zooepidemicus and other group C and G streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bordetella bronchiseptica have been reported as primary and secondary bacterial pathogens in pneumonia in ferrets (Fox, 1998a).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nBacterial pneumonia may occur secondary to megaesophagus in the ferret. An influenza virus-bacteria synergism has been the subject of several studies in ferrets (Fox, 1998a). Debilitated and immunosuppressed animals and animals with concurrent diseases such as influenza may be more susceptible to bacterial pneumonias (Fox, 1998a).\n\nClinical signs.\n\nClinical signs may include nasal discharge, dyspnea, lethargy, anorexia, increased lung sounds, cyanosis, and fever (Rosenthal, 1997). Fulminant pneumonia may progress to sepsis and death (Fox, 1998a).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical findings, a complete blood count, culture and cytology of a tracheal wash or lung wash, and radiographs (Rosenthal, 1997).\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nDiagnostic rule-outs include dilatative cardimyopathy, heartworm disease, mycotic pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunosuppressed animals, neoplasia, and influenza.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nTreatment should consist of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, which may include the administration of oxygen, fluid therapy, and force feeding (Rosenthal, 1997).\n\nh. Abscesses\n\nEtiology.\n\nA variety of bacteria have been associated with abscesses and localized infection of the lung, liver, uterus, vulva, skin, mammary glands, and oral cavity. These include Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Pasteurella, Actinomyces, hemolytic Escherichia coli, and Aeromonas spp. (Fox, 1998a).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nAbscesses in ferrets may result from wounds that are inflicted secondary to biting during fighting, playing, mating, or chewing sharp objects.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nLocalized or subcutaneous abscesses present as swellings with or without draining tracts. The swelling may be fluctuant. In most cases, the abscess is walled off and does not result in systemic signs (Fox, 1998a). Abscesses or infection involving visceral organs may give rise to organ-specific and/or systemic signs.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nCytologic and Gram staining of an aspirate of a suspect subcutaneous swelling will aid in the definitive diagnosis. Culture and sensitivity of the aspirate should also be performed to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of a subcutaneous swelling in a ferret should include myiasis, granuloma, hematoma, and neoplasia.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nPrevention of ferrets from exposure to sharp objects in the cage and feed, and limiting the exposure of male and female during breeding, can minimize the occurrence of abscesses. Treatment of localized abscesses should include appropriate antibiotic therapy and establishment of drainage and debridement if necessary. Bacterial culture and sensitivity of the exudate should be performed. A broad-spectrum antimicrobial may be used pending results of culture and sensitivity (Orcutt, 1997).\n\ni. Mastitis\n\nEtiology.\n\nGram-positive cocci such as Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms such as hemolytic E. coli are the most frequently associated organisms (Bernard et al., 1984; Bell, 1997a).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nAlthough the exact pathogenesis of mastitis in ferrets is not clear, a number of factors may play a role and include the stress of lactation, injury to mammary glands by the kits’ teeth, environmental contamination, and the virulence of the organism. In one report, the causative organism, hemolytic E. coli, was cultured from the feces of mastitic and healthy ferrets and the oral cavity of suckling kits (Liberson et al., 1983). The high level of perineal contamination and the presence of the organism in the oral cavity of suckling kits may enhance transmission and introduction of this organism into mammary tissue. In another outbreak, the causative organisms were cultured from bovine meat fed prior to the outbreak, and the meat was suspected as a possible source.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nMastitis occurs in nursing jills and has been characterized as acute or chronic (Bell, 1997a). The acute form is reported to occur soon after parturition or after the third week of lactation. Examination of affected jills reveals swollen, firm, red or purple, and painful glands. Affected glands may quickly become gangrenous. The chronic form, which may occur when kits are 3 weeks old or as a sequela to the acute form, is characterized by glands that are firm but not painful or discolored.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, physical examination findings, and isolation of the causative organism.\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nIn acute mastitis, grossly affected glands are swollen, and the skin overlying the gland may be discolored. Surgical biopsies and necropsies of 8 ferrets with mastitis caused by hemolytic E. coli (Liberson et al., 1983) revealed extensive edema, hemorrhage, and coagulative and liquefactive necrosis involving the glandular tissue as well as surrounding subcutaneous tissue. Other findings included the presence of a mixed leukocytic infiltrate composed primarily of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; large numbers of bacteria; and thrombosis and necrosis of vessels within and immediately adjacent to areas of inflammation (Liberson et al., 1983).\n\nIn an outbreak of mastitis in mink due to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, histologic examination of affected glands revealed an acute suppurative mastitis with desquamation of alveolar epithelium, edema of the connective tissue stroma, alveoli filled with neutrophils and cellular debris, and lactiferous ducts filled with purulent exudate and mats of bacteria within lobules (Trautwein and Helmboldt, 1966).\n\nTreatment.\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotic therapy may be instituted pending culture and sensitivity results of the milk. Enrofloxacin (2.5 mg/kg BID PO after a loading dose of 5.0 mg/kg IM) is often effective. Jills may require aggressive care, because acute mastitis may progress rapidly and animals may become septicemic and moribund (Liberson et al., 1983). Oral antibiotic administration to kits nursing affected jills is recommended (Bell, 1997a). Surgical resection and debridement of affected glands and supportive care may be necessary for jills with acute mastitis. Supplementation of kits with milk replacer may also be necessary, because jills with acute mastitis are reluctant to nurse, and jills with the chronic form have diminished lactation as milk-producing tissue is replaced by scar tissue (Bell, 1997a). Maintaining thorough personal hygiene practices when handling affected jills is important in minimizing spread to other lactating jills. Cross-fostering kits may be required; however, kits may spread infection to healthy jills. It is reported that jills with the chronic form of mastitis should be culled (Bell, 1997a).\n\n2. Viral Infections\n\na. Canine Distemper\n\nEtiology.\n\nCanine distemper (CD) is caused by a paramyxovirus of genus Morbillivirus that is related to measles and rinderpest (Budd, 1981). There are several strains, including a ferret-adapted strain of canine distemper virus (CDV), that vary in incubation, clinical signs, and duration (Fox et al., 1998b). The virus can be inactivated by heat, light, and various chemicals, including phenol, Roccal, sodium hydroxide, and formalin (Shen and Gorham, 1980; Budd, 1981). Infectious virions have been recovered from fomites after 20 min at room temperature. Canine distemper is the most serious viral infection of ferrets. Mortality approaches 100%, making appropriate husbandry and vaccination imperative.\n\nThe disease has a catarrhal phase and a neurological, or central nervous system (CNS), phase. The catarrhal phase is 7–10 days postinfection and involves anorexia, pyrexia, photosensitivity, and serous nasal discharge. An erythematous pruritic rash spreads from the chin to the inguinal region. It is suspected that the rash results from cell-mediated immunity to infected endothelial cells, similar to the response seen in humans with measles (Norrby and Oxman, 1990). Hyperkeratosis of footpads, called hard pad, is an inconsistent feature. Secondary bacterial infections result in mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharge and possibly bacterial pneumonia. The CNS phase, with ataxia, tremors, and paralysis, may or may not be preceded by the catarrhal phase. Death occurs in 12–16 days from ferret strains of CDV and up to 35 days with canine strains. Infection is uniformly fatal.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nVirus is shed from infected hosts from conjunctival, nasal, and oral exudates, urine, feces, and sloughed skin (Gorham and Brandly, 1953). Transplacental infection is not reported in ferrets. Attenuated CDV vaccine strains have not been recovered from the body secretions of ferrets following vaccination (Shen et al., 1981). Unvaccinated dogs and other canids, mustelids, and procyonids may serve as reservoirs of infection.\n\nViremia is detectable 2 days postinfection and persists until the ferret dies or mounts a neutralizing antibody response (Liu and Coffin, 1957). The primary site of replication is the respiratory and lymphatic systems, and CDV has been recovered from the nasal secretions of ferrets 5–13 days postinfection. A decrease in lymphocyte subsets is detectable 5–30 days postinfection.\n\nClinical signs and necropsy findings.\n\nHistologically, intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies may be observed in tracheal, bronchial, epithelia, and bile duct as well as transitional epithelium in the bladder (Liu and Coffin, 1957) ( ). The eosinophilic (hematoxylin–eosin) inclusions appear orange using Pollack's trichrome stain.\n\nDiagnosis and differential diagnoses.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis is based on clinical observation, questionable vaccination history, and exposure. A fluorescent antibody test can be used on peripheral blood and conjunctival mononuclear cells to detect infection. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has also been used to detect experimental infection (Stephensen et al., 1997). Differential diagnoses should include infection with influenza virus or Bordetella bronchiseptica. Influenza does not rapidly progress to mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharge as CD does.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nDuring an outbreak, clinically affected ferrets should be isolated and the remainder of the colony vaccinated. Distemper infection can be prevented by vaccination with modified live vaccine of chicken embryo tissue culture origin (CETCO) administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Kits should be vaccinated every 2–3 weeks, starting at age 6 weeks, until 14 weeks and annually thereafter (Fox et al., 1998b). It is important to adhere to the prescribed vaccination protocol, because ferret deaths have been reported following double-dose vaccination (Carpenter et al., 1976). Inactivated distemper vaccines do not elicit consistent, effective immunity and are not recommended. It is important to know the vaccination schedule of your ferret supplier and to vaccinate supplementally as appropriate. New ferrets should be held in quarantine for 2 weeks prior to introduction into the resident colony.\n\nFerrets have been experimentally infected with feline panleukopenia, canine parvovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, mink enteritis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and Pseudorabies, but natural infection with these viruses has not been reported (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nb. Aleutian Disease\n\nEtiology.\n\nAleutian disease virus (ADV) is a parvovirus with strains of varying virulence and immunogenicity. Mink-derived strains are more virulent to mink than are ferret-derived strains (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nAleutian disease (AD) is a chronic progressive illness that was first described in mink (Oxenham, 1990). It was originally named hypergammaglobulinemia (HGG) because of this remarkable finding. Infection may be subclinical for years. Because the immunomodulation associated with ADV infection is disruptive to biomedical research, it is important to seek sources of ADV-free ferrets (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nTransmission between ferrets may be direct or via aerosol of urine, saliva, blood, feces, and fomites (Kenyon et al., 1963; Gorham et al., 1964). Vertical transmission is established in mink but is unproven in ferrets.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nFerrets infected with ADV as adults develop persistent infection but rarely disease, although chronic progressive weight loss, cachexia, malaise, and melena have been described (Porter et al., 1982). AD may also cause ataxia, paralysis, tremors, and convulsions (Oxenham, 1990; Welchman et al., 1993). The lesions are typically immune-mediated, and there is elevation of the gammaglobulins to generally greater than 20% of the total proteins (Porter et al., 1982; ). The precise mechanism of immunomodulation is unknown, but in mink there is depression of B- and T-cell responses.\n\nNecropsy.\n\nFerrets may have no lesions upon necropsy, or infrequently they may have hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. The most consistent histological finding is periportal lymphocytic infiltrates ( ). Bile duct hyperplasia and periportal fibrosis have also been reported. Membranous glomerulonephritis has been described (Ohshima et al., 1978). Although lesions are subtle, use of ADV-infected ferrets in biomedical research is contraindicated because histological lesions interfere with the interpretation of study results (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nDiagnosis and differential diagnoses.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis is based on HGG and chronic weight loss. Diagnosis is confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) or counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) for antibody to ADV antigen (Palley et al., 1992). PCR-based assays have also been used (Erdman et al., 1996b; Saifuddin and Fox, 1996; Erdman et al., 1997). Differential diagnoses include the neurotropic form of CD, as well as chronic wasting diseases such as neoplasia, malabsorption, maldigestion, and bacterial enteritis (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nVaccination against ADV would be contraindicated because of the immune-mediated reaction, and a vaccine is not available. Chemical disinfection may be achieved with formalin, sodium hydroxide, and phenolics (Shen et al., 1981). There is no treatment for AD, and infected ferrets should be culled from the colony.\n\nc. Influenza\n\nEtiology.\n\nInfluenza is caused by an orthomyxovirus that is transmissible from humans to ferrets and ferrets to humans (Smith and Stuart-Harris, 1936). Human influenza viruses A and B are pathogenic to ferrets (Fox et al., 1998b). Ferrets are also susceptible to avian, phocine, equine, and swine influenza, although only porcine influenza causes clinical signs. Because the viruses can be readily transmitted from humans to ferrets, handling precautions such as wearing masks and gloves should be in place to minimize transmission.\n\nEpizootiology, transmission, and clinical signs.\n\nInfluenza virus generally remains localized in nasal epithelium in ferrets but may cause pneumonia. Clinical signs appear 48 hr postinfection and include anorexia, fever, sneezing, and serous nasal discharge. Conjunctivitis, photosensitivity, and otitis are also sometimes seen (Fox et al., 1998b). Secondary bacterial infection by Streptococcus sp. and occasionally Bordetella bronchiseptica may prolong recovery. Transmission occurs via aerosol and direct contact.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on typical clinical presentation and recovery within 4 days, unlike with CD, which progresses to more severe disease and death. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers on acute and convalescent sera are rarely needed.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nAntibiotic therapy may be instituted to preclude secondary bacterial infection. Animal technicians and investigators suffering from influenza should avoid contact with ferrets.\n\nFerrets have been used extensively as a model for influenza research because the biological response to infection is similar to that in humans (Fox et al., 1998b). Ferrets have been used in influenza A research to study pathogenesis, to investigate Reye's syndrome, and to evaluate vaccine trials (Deshmukh, 1987; Sweet et al., 1987).\n\nd. Rabies\n\nEtiology.\n\nRabies is caused by a rhabdovirus. Rabies infection is infrequently reported in ferrets, and until recently, research on rabies in ferrets was lacking (Fox et al., 1998b). Ferrets in a well-managed facility would have low risk of exposure to rabies virus.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nA USDA-approved, killed rabies vaccine given subcutaneously at ages 3 months and 1 year and annually thereafter is recommended to protect ferrets against rabies (Rupprecht et al., 1990). Modified live vaccine (MLV) is not recommended, because there is at least one case of rabies in a ferret that was vaccinated with MLV rabies vaccine (Fox et al., 1998b). There is no treatment for rabies.\n\nClinical signs and pathogenesis.\n\nClinical signs of rabies infection in ferrets may include anxiety, lethargy, and posterior paresis. In one experimental infection, 11 of 40 ferrets died, and Negri bodies were seen in the brain of only 2 of the 11 (Blancou et al., 1982). There is conflicting data on the isolation of rabies virus from the salivary glands following experimental infection. In one study using raccoon variant of rabies for infection, more than half of the ferrets had rabies isolated from the salivary glands (Fox et al., 1998b). Ferrets at risk for exposure to rabies virus that bite or scratch a human should be placed under quarantine for not less than 10 days of observation. Veterinarians and facility managers should seek assistance from state public health officials.\n\nDiagnosis and differential diagnoses.\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes the neurotropic form of CD. Diagnosis is based on direct IFA of brain tissue. Because rabies in ferrets is poorly understood, the head from ferrets that exhibit signs compatible with rabies and that have exposure histories that raise concerns about rabies should be shipped to the state public health authority for confirmation.\n\ne. Rotavirus\n\nEtiology.\n\nRotaviruses cause diarrhea in young of many species, including humans, calves, pigs, sheep, and rats. Diarrhea in ferret kits is thought to be caused by a poorly characterized, atypical rotavirus that has not been cultivated in vitro (Torres-Medina, 1987). Atypical rotaviruses lack the rotavirus common antigen.\n\nEpizootiology, transmission and clinical signs.\n\nClinical disease may occur in kits as young as 1–4 days old or in older animals up to 6 weeks of age. Diarrhea soils the perineum and possibly the fur and nest material. Mortality rates are age-dependent, with high mortality occurring in young kits and lower mortality occurring in kits over 10 days of age (Bell, 1997a; Fox et al., 1998b). Secondary bacterial infection may influence the severity of diarrhea.\n\nNecropsy and pathogenesis.\n\nLesions are restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Yellow-green liquid or mucous feces may be seen in the terminal colon on necropsy. Subtle small-intestinal villous atrophy and epithelial cell vacuolation are detectable histologically.\n\nDiagnosis and differential diagnoses.\n\nClinical diagnosis can be confirmed by using clarified and ultracentrifuged fecal pellets for electron microscopy. The ferret rotavirus does not cross-react with commercially available enzyme immunoassays (Torres-Medina, 1987).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nIt is desirable to avoid sources that are known to be infected with ferret rotavirus. Affected kits may be supplemented with kitten milk replacer, using a medicine dropper. Mortality is reduced if the kits continue nursing. Treatment of secondary bacterial infections may reduce severity of the diarrhea, and supportive care, including subcutaneous fluid administration for young kits, may be required (Fox et al., 1998b). Jills develop immunity to rotavirus infection, and subsequent litters are protected.\n\nf. Other Viruses\n\nInfectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) was isolated from the liver, spleen, and lung of clinically normal ferrets (Porter et al., 1975). Raw beef was suspected as the source of infection, reinforcing the need to exclude raw meat products from the diet of ferrets used for research. IBR does cause significant respiratory pathology in experimentally infected ferrets (Porter et al., 1975).\n\nA transmissible diarrhea, referred to as epizootic catarrhal enteritis, has been observed in adult ferrets several days after direct contact and fomite exposure to affected ferrets (Fox et al., 1998b). Clinically the diarrhea is green and bile-tinged, and the ferrets become rapidly dehydrated. Mortality is low. Some ferrets develop elevated liver enzymes. Treatment involves aggressive oral and systemic fluid therapy. A recent study implicates a coronavirus as the cause of this disease (Williams et al., 2000).\n\n3. Parasitic Infections\n\na. Protozoa\n\ni. Enteric coccidiosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nThree species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria have been reported to infect the ferret: Isospora laidlawi, Eimeria furonis, and E. ictidea (Blankenship-Paris et al., 1993).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nInfection occurs from ingestion of sporulated oocysts.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nCoccidiosis in ferrets is usually subclinical but has been reported to be associated with diarrhea, lethargy, and dehydration in one ferret (Blankenship-Paris et al., 1993). Clinical signs are often seen in young, newly acquired ferrets and are more common after a stressful event (Rosenthal, 1994). Rectal prolapse can also develop in association with coccidial infection (Rosenthal, 1994).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is generally made by any of the fecal flotation methods commonly used in veterinary practice or by direct wet mount of feces and microscopic examination for sporulated or unsporulated oocysts. Because coccidial oocysts are small, slides should be examined under higher magnification.\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nDiagnosis is usually performed antemortem. Pathologic lesions associated with enteric coccidiosis in a laboratory-reared ferret that was euthanized were described in one published report (Blankenship-Paris et al., 1993). Microscopic lesions were confined to the jejunum and ileum and consisted of villous and epithelial thickening. Parasitic cysts and microorganisms within epithelium, and a mild granulomatous inflammation in the villar lamina propria, were also observed. A recent report documents clinical and anatomic pathology associated with biliary coccidiosis in a weanling ferret (Williams et al., 1996).\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nDiarrhea may be observed in ferrets that present with gastroenteritis secondary to gastrointestinal foreign bodies and dietary indiscretion, as well as other nutritional, inflammatory, infectious, or other systemic diseases. Infectious causes such as proliferative colitis, salmonellosis, giardiasis, rotavirus, and campylobacteriosis should be considered. Diarrhea may also be seen in eosinophilic gastroenteritis, an uncommonly reported condition in ferrets.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nGood husbandry practices that include sanitation and frequent disposal of feces reduce the number of oocysts in the environment. Cleaning cages with a strong ammonium hydroxide solution is reported to be effective (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987). Heat treatment of surfaces and utensils may also be effective (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987). Treatment of ferrets with sulfadimethoxine at 50 mg/kg orally once and then 25 mg/kg orally every 24 hr for 9 days is recommended (Rosenthal, 1994). As in dogs and cats, the complete elimination of a coccidial infection requires an immunocompetent host.\n\nii. Cryptosporidiosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is caused by infection with Cryptosporidium spp.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nCryptosporidium is a protozoan in the class Sporozoa, subclass Coccidia, that inhabits the respiratory and intestinal epithelium of birds, reptiles, mammals, and fish (Regh et al., 1988). It is known to cause gastrointestinal tract disease in many species, including rodents, dogs, cats, calves, and people (Hill and Lappin, 1995). It has a life cycle similar to other coccidian parasites and is transmitted by ingestion of sporulated oocysts. Autoinfection is also a characteristic of the life cycle.\n\nTransmission may occur through consumption of contaminated food or water. Cattle, dogs, and cats, shedding oocysts, are reported to be potential sources of human infection (Hill and Lappin, 1995; Fox, 1998g). Immunosuppressed people are at greatest risk of developing severe fulminating gastrointestinal disease (Hill and Lappin, 1995). The finding of cryptosporidiosis in two ferrets that died from unrelated causes in one animal facility resulted in a survey of the existing ferret population and new arrivals into the facility to determine the prevalence and incidence of infection (Regh et al., 1988). Findings indicated that 40% of the resident population and 38–100% of new arrivals had oocysts in their feces but showed no clinical signs.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nOnly subclinical infection has been reported in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed ferrets (Regh et al., 1988).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the identification of the organism in feces. The oocysts are small when compared with other coccidia and may be overlooked or mistaken for yeasts (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987). Yeasts are oval, whereas Cryptosporidium oocysts are spherical or ellipsoidal. Additionally, yeasts will stain with iodine and are not acid-fast, whereas Cryptosporidium has the opposite staining characteristics. The oocyst residuum is seen as a refractive dot under phase-contrast microscopy, a structure lacking in yeast (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987). Sugar-solution centrifugation and fecal sedimentation using formalin-ether or formalin-ethyl acetate are effective diagnostic concentration techniques (Hill and Lappin, 1995). Oocysts may then be viewed with phase-contrast or bright-field microscopy of specimens stained with an acid-fast method. A direct fecal smear may be methanol- or heat-fixed and stained with an acid-fast method (Hill and Lappin, 1995).\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nHistologic evaluation reveals the presence of organisms, spherical to ovoid in shape and from 2 to 5 μm in diameter, associated with the brush border of the villi. A mild eosinophilic infiltrate was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine in most animals. The ileum was the most common and heavily infected section of small intestine (Regh et al., 1988).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nThere is no known definitive treatment for cryptosporidiosis (Fox, 1998g). Supportive and symptomatic care should be provided in clinical cryptosporidiosis. Infections are self-limiting in immunocompetent patients (Fox, 1998g). Control is aimed at eliminating or reducing infective oocysts in the environment and avoidance of contact with known sources. Because of the potential for zoonotic transmission, restricting contact of children and immunosuppressed individuals with infected ferrets and practicing good hygiene may help reduce the potential for infection. Drying, freeze-thawing, and steam cleaning inactivate the organism (Hill and Lappin, 1995). There are few effective commercial disinfectants.\n\nb. Ectoparasites and Mites\n\ni. Sarcoptic mange\n\nEtiology.\n\nSarcoptic mange is caused by infection with Sarcoptes scabiei.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nTransmission occurs through direct contact with infected hosts or contact with fomites. This parasitic infection is rare under research conditions.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nInfection of ferrets with S. scabiei may occur in a generalized or a pedal form (Bernard et al., 1984). In the generalized form, lesions consist of focal or generalized alopecia with intense pruritus. In the pedal form, lesions are confined to the toes and feet, which become swollen and encrusted with scabs. Nails may be deformed or lost if the condition is left untreated.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is made by finding the mites in skin scrapings or removing crusts, breaking them up, and clearing with 10% KOH for microscopic examination (Phillips et al., 1987). False-negative results are possible; multiple scrapings may be necessary.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis should include other pruritic external parasitic conditions, including flea infestation. Demodicosis has been reported to cause mild pruritus and alopecia in ferrets (Noli et al., 1996).\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nIn the pedal form, treatment consists of trimming the claws and removing the scabs after softening them in warm water (Bernard et al., 1984). Treatments that have been used include ivermectin, 0.2–0.4 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously and repeated every 7–14 days until mites are gone; shampoos or soaks to reduce the pruritus; and topical or systemic antibiotic administration for treatment of secondary bacterial dermatitis (Hillyer and Quesenberry, 1997b). Alternatively, weekly dips in 2% lime sulfur until 2 weeks after clinical cure have been shown to be effective (Fox, 1998a). Treatment of all affected animals as well as contact animals, and decontamination of enclosures and bedding, are recommended.\n\nii. Demodicosis\n\nEtiology.\n\nDemodicosis is caused by infection by Demodex spp.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nThe parasite is found in normal skin of almost all dogs and is not considered contagious. Predisposing factors such as immunologic or genetic conditions have been suggested (Kwochka, 1986). One clinical report describes demodicosis in two adult ferrets that had been treated with an ear ointment containing triamcinolone acetonide for recurrent ear infections daily for 3 periods of 3 months each during the course of a year (Noli et al., 1996).\n\nClinical signs.\n\nIn the report mentioned above, the ferrets presented with alopecia, pruritus, and orange discoloration of the skin behind the ears and on the ventral surface of the abdomen and an accompanying seborrhea (Noli et al., 1996).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDeep skin scrapings should be performed to demonstrate mites. Finding a large number of live adult mites or immature forms and eggs is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. In very chronic cases, the skin may be so thickened that scrapings may be unrewarding. In these cases, a skin biopsy may be diagnostic (Kwochka, 1986).\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nHistologic evaluation of skin biopsies obtained in the case report described above revealed mites with a short, blunted abdomen similar to that of Demodex criceti and located in the infundibulum of hairs. The epidermis was slightly hypertrophic, and there was a mild superficial orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. A very mild superficial and perivascular mixed cellular infiltrate was also observed in the dermis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nGeneralized demodicosis should be differentiated from sarcoptic mange and flea infestation. Primary or secondary bacterial dermatitis or pyoderma should also be considered.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nThe ferrets in the above-mentioned clinical report were treated initially with a suspension of 0.0125% amitraz applied as a dip 3 times at 7-day intervals for 3 treatments. Two drops of the same solution were applied in each ear every other day. After the initial treatment, the ferrets were reexamined, and treatment was continued with the same concentration of solution applied once every 5 days, while the tail was washed with a higher concentration of amitraz (0.025%) once every other day. Thereafter, 3 final treatments with 0.0375% amitraz every 5 days for the body, and every other day for the ears and tail, were administered. The ferrets were evaluated and skin scrapings were performed regularly during treatment and posttreatment to monitor response to therapy. Treatment of any associated pyodermas, systemic illnesses, or management problems should also be included as part of the therapeutic regimen.\n\niii. Ear mites\n\nEtiology.\n\nThe ear mite, Otodectes cynotis, which commonly infects dogs and cats, is also a common clinical problem in ferrets (Fox, 1998g).\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nEar mites are transmitted through direct contact with infested ferrets, dogs, or cats (Fox, 1998g). The entire life cycle is completed in 3 weeks.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nEar mite infestation in the ferret is usually asymptomatic (Orcutt, 1997). However, clinical signs may include head shaking; mild to severe pruritus with inflammation and excoriation; secondary otitis interna with ataxia; circling; torticollis; and Horner's syndrome (Orcutt, 1997; Fox, 1998g). A brownish black waxy discharge is often present.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on direct observation of mites via otoscopic examination or microscopic identification of the ear mite or any of the life-cycle stages of the mite in exudate from the ear canal.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nSeveral treatment regimens, including topical and injectable mitocidal treatments, have been recommended (Orcutt, 1997; Fox, 1998g). A recent study using three treatment regimens—two topical and one injectable—revealed that topical treatments were more efficacious than the injectable in reducing or eradicating ear mites (Patterson et al., 1999). Efficacy was evaluated by microscopic evidence of ear mites in debris from aural swabs taken weekly for an 8-week period. Topical 1% ivermectin (Ivomec, Merck AgVet Division, Rahway, New Jersey), diluted 1:10 in propylene glycol at a dosage of 400 μg/kg body weight divided equally between the two ear canals and administered on days 1 and 14 of the study, was the most effective treatment. All susceptible animals in a household should be treated. Ears should be gently cleaned prior to initiating treatment (Orcutt, 1997). High doses of injectable ivermectin (0.2 ml of 1% ivermectin) administered to jills at 2–4 weeks of gestation resulted in high rates of congenital defects (Orcutt, 1997).\n\niv. Fleas\n\nEtiology.\n\nCtenocephalides species can infest ferrets.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nTransmission requires direct contact with another infested animal or a flea-infested environment.\n\nClinical signs.\n\nFlea infestation may be asymptomatic or may cause mild to intense pruritus and alopecia of the dorsal thorax and neck (Timm, 1988).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs and identification of fleas or flea excrement.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nSarcoptic and demodectic mange should be included in the differential diagnosis of pruritic skin disease in the ferret. Close examination of the pelage for fleas or flea excrement should be performed. Skin scrapings may be indicated.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nAs with flea infestation in dogs and cats, concurrent treatment of the environment, as well as all animals in the household, is essential for effective flea control. Compounds approved for flea control in cats such as rotenone or Pyrethrin powders or sprays may be used in ferrets (Hillyer and Quesenberry, 1997a).\n\n4. Fungal Diseases\n\nFerrets may develop systemic disease from Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma. The reservoir of most of these fungi is the soil, however, making infection unlikely in a research facility. In production facilities, exposure can be minimized through careful selection of source animals, appropriate sanitation, and control of pests, particularly birds.\n\na. Pneumocystis carinii\n\nPneumocystis carinii has been recently reclassified as a fungus. Although P. carinii inhabits the lungs of many different species, recent transmission studies suggest that these fungi are highly species-specific (Gigliotti et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1998b). Clinical disease is evident only in immunocompromised ferrets and can be induced using high doses of exogenous steroids (Stokes et al., 1987). Lesions include interstitial pneumonitis with mononuclear cell infiltrates; cysts and trophozooites are evident with Gomori methanamine–silver nitrate and Giemsa on bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole probably controls but does not eliminate infection (Fox et al., 1998b).\n\nb. Mucormycosis\n\nFerrets are susceptible to secondary fungal infection of the outer ear canal with Absida corymbifera or Malassezia spp. (Dinsdale and Rest, 1995; Fox, 1998d). The fungi are widespread in the environment and will cause a secondary fungal infection in the ears of ferrets infested with Otodectes cynotis. The yeasts can be visualized by impressions of ear exudates. Treatment involves eradication of the underlying mite infestation followed by oral and topical ketoconazole, miconazole, and polymyxin B.\n\nc. Dermatomycosis\n\nDermatomycoses in ferrets are caused by Microsporum canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Dermatophytes are transmissible to humans and are a zoonosis; thus affected animals should be quarantined and removed from the facility to minimize risk (Dinsdale and Rest, 1995; Scott et al., 1995; Fox et al., 1998b). Control of infection includes general disinfection and destruction of contaminated bedding. Lesions are circumscribed areas of alopecia and inflammation, which begin as small papules that spread peripherally in a scaly inflamed ring. The yellow-green fluorescence of M. canis under ultraviolet light helps distinguish it from T. mentagrophytes. Skin scrapings digested with 10% potassium hydroxide reveal characteristic arthrospores. Treatment with griseofulvin causes clinical remission but may not clear infection.\n\n5. Other\n\nOther ectoparasitic infections observed to occur in ferrets include cutaneous myiasis and tick infestation. Granulomatous masses in the cervical region caused by the larval stage of Hypoderma bovis have been reported in ferrets (Fox, 1998g). Cuterebra larvae, although uncommonly observed in ferrets, may cause subdermal cysts found in the subcutis of the neck (Orcutt, 1997). Infestation with the flesh fly has been reported as a problem in commercially reared mink and ferrets housed outdoors (Fox, 1998g).\n\nTicks may be found on ferrets housed outdoors or on those used for hunting rabbits (Fox, 1998g). Ticks should be removed carefully with hemostats or tweezers, ensuring that the entire head and mouthparts are removed from the skin. Appropriate caution should be exercised in tick removal, because ticks are responsible for transmission of various zoonotic pathogens; gloves should be worn.\n\n6. Nematodes\n\na. Heartworm\n\nEtiology.\n\nThe ferret is susceptible to natural and experimental infection with Dirofilaria immitis.\n\nEpizootiology and transmission.\n\nDirofilaria immitis is a filarial parasite that is transmitted by mosquitoes, which serve as the intermediate host and vector. Microfilaria are ingested by mosquitoes and, after two molts, become infective third-stage larvae. Infective larvae are deposited onto the skin when mosquitoes feed, and larvae find their way into the body of the final host through the bite wound and migrate subcutaneously to the thorax and eventually to the heart (Knight, 1987). The primary reservoir of infection is dogs, but heartworm may be found in a variety of mammals, including humans. All other species except wild and domestic canids, domestic felines, ferrets, and the California sea lion are considered aberrant hosts (Knight, 1987).\n\nClinical signs.\n\nThe following clinical signs have been reported in clinical reports describing cases of D. immitis in the ferret: weakness, lethargy, depression, dyspnea, cyanosis, anorexia, dehydration, cough, and pale mucous membranes (Miller and Merton, 1982; Parrott et al., 1984; Moreland et al., 1986). Moist lung sounds and/or muffled heart sounds were revealed by thoracic auscultation in many of these cases. Pleural or abdominal effusion may be observed radiologically. The ferrets described in these cases were housed outdoors and either died or were euthanized.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis of heartworm is based on clinical signs, radiographic findings, and testing for circulating microfilariae and heartworm antigen. Microfilaremia is not consistently observed in naturally occurring and experimental cases of heartworm infection in ferrets (Fox, 1998g). Testing for heartworm antigen appears to be more diagnostically useful (Stamoulis et al., 1997). In a study to determine the minimum oral dose of ivermectin needed for monthly heartworm prophylaxis in ferrets, the use of an antigen test (Uni-Tec Canine Heartworm test, Pitman-Moore Co., Mundelein, Illinois) detected infection in more untreated control animals than did the modified Knott test for detection of circulating microfilaria in the same ferrets (Supakorndej et al., 1992).\n\nNecropsy findings.\n\nCardiomegaly, pleural and/or abdominal fluid, and pulmonary congestion are common findings at necropsy. Grossly, adult worms have been observed in the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and cranial and caudal vena cava. Microscopically, microfilaria may be seen in small and large vessels of the lung.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis should include primary cardiac diseases, such as dilatative cardiomyopathy, and other systemic or pulmonary diseases.\n\nTreatment and control.\n\nControl is best directed at prevention through the administration of heartworm preventative and it is recommended that ferrets in heartworm-endemic areas receive monthly oral ivermectin throughout the year (Stamoulis et al., 1997; Fox, 1998g). The dosage recommended for ferrets by the American Heartworm Society is 0.006 mg/kg body weight monthly (Fox, 1998g). Housing ferrets indoors, particularly during the mosquito season, would help minimize exposure. Successful adulticide treatment in ferrets has been described and includes the administration of thiacetarsemide, with the same precautions used in dogs: antithrombotic therapy, treatment for heart failure, and strict cage confinement (Stamoulis et al., 1997).
