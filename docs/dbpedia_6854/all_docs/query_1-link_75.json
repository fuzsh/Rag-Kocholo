        "text": "The blood type diet is a popular diet that suggests your ABO blood group may determine the best foods for you to eat. However, very little scientific research supports its claimed benefits.\n\nThe blood type diet (BTD), also known as the blood group diet, was popularized in 1996 by Dr. Peter D’Adamo in his book “Eat Right 4 Your Type.”\n\nIn this book, Dr. D’Adamo claims the optimal diet and exercise regimen for any one individual depends on their ABO blood type. This may supposedly have benefits like improved health and decreased risk of chronic diseases.\n\nHe also claims that each blood type represents the genetic traits of our ancestors, such as which diet they evolved to thrive on.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about the BTD and if it’s right for you.\n\nYour blood type is based on genetics, so the BTD categorizes foods to eat to reflect the diet your ancestors would have consumed.\n\nDr. D’Adamo claims that blood types evolved from different societies, so they each have an optimal diet:\n\nType A, known as Agrarian, thrives on a mostly vegetarian diet.\n\nType B, known as Nomadic, thrives on a high dairy diet.\n\nType AB, known as Enigma, thrives on a mixture of type A and B diets.\n\nType O, known as Hunter, is supposedly the oldest blood type and thrives on a high animal protein diet.\n\nOne of the central theories of the BTD has to do with proteins called lectins. These are a family of proteins that can bind to carbohydrate molecules.\n\nPlant-based lectins are sometimes referred to as antinutrients and may cause negative effects in humans, such as:\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhea\n\nabdominal pain\n\nAccording to the BTD theory, eating the wrong types of lectins may specifically target different ABO blood types. They may cause red blood cells to agglutinate, or clump together, which could increase your risk of disease.\n\nSome research suggests that a small percentage of lectins in raw, uncooked legumes can have agglutinating activity specific to a certain blood type. For example, a 2004 review suggests that raw lima beans may affect red blood cells in people with blood type A.\n\nOverall, however, it appears that the majority of agglutinating lectins react with all ABO blood types. This means that lectins in the diet may not be blood-type specific, except for a few varieties of raw legumes.\n\nBelow is a list of some foods to eat for each blood type, as recommended by Dr. D’Adamo.\n\nAll four diets are mostly based on real, healthy foods, rather than processed foods.\n\nSo, even if you try one of these diets and your health improves, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to do with your blood type. The health benefits may simply be a result of eating healthier food than before.\n\nBelow is a list of some foods to avoid for each blood type, as recommended by Dr. D’Adamo.\n\nType AType BType ABType O• lima beans\n\n• garbanzo beans\n\n• eggplants\n\n• tomatoes• chicken\n\n• corn\n\n• soy\n\n• lentils• chicken\n\n• corn\n\n• bananas\n\n• fava beans• wheat\n\n• soybean oil\n\n• peanuts\n\n• kidney beans\n\nDoes research support blood type diets?\n\nResearch on ABO blood types has advanced rapidly in the past few decades.\n\nFor example, the authors of a 2022 study cite many associations that have been made between blood types and various diseases, such as:\n\nhepatitis\n\nthrombosis\n\ncardiovascular diseases\n\ncognitive disorders\n\ncirculatory system diseases\n\ninfections\n\ntuberculosis\n\nHowever, no studies suggest that these are related to diet. The minimal research that does exist on BTD doesn’t support Dr. D’Adamo’s claims that specific foods may cause benefits or harm to certain blood groups.\n\nIn a 2014 study of 1,455 participants, eating a type A diet of fruits and vegetables was associated with better health markers. However, this effect was seen in everyone following the type A diet, not just individuals with type A blood.\n\nSimilarly, a 2018 study of 973 adults with overweight found that matching a participant’s blood type with the respective recommended BTD didn’t impact the link between BTD and markers of cardiometabolic disease.\n\nLastly, in a 2020 study, 68 participants of different blood types ate a low fat vegan diet for 16 weeks. At the end of the 16 weeks, the researchers found no major differences in cardiometabolic changes between any of the groups.\n\nDoes blood type diet work?\n\nThe short answer is: maybe. Some research suggests that eating certain foods is associated with better health markers. However, no research supports the claim that specific diets are better for specific blood types. The BTD removes the majority of unhealthy processed foods. This may be why it works, without any regard to the different blood types.\n\nWhat blood type should eat meat?\n\nAccording to Dr. D’Adamo’s BTD, all four blood types can eat meat. However, the recommended diet for type A is mostly vegetarian and only recommends poultry and fish, while the type O diet is mostly animal protein-based.\n\nIs type O+ blood rare?\n\nType O+ blood is the most common type of blood."
