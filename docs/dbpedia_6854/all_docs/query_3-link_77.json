        "text": "Photo: Erica Snyder\n\nIf this chapter of my life were made into a coming-of-age film, Peter McPoland's \"String Lights\" is the song I would want to play at the very end. \"String Lights\" captures the experience of existing in a moment, and feeling sad that one day that moment will transform into a bittersweet memory. Heartful and raw as ever, McPoland explores the self-inflicting pain that comes with reminiscing a little too hard.\n\nOn \"String Lights,\" the 21-year-old singer-songwriter adds a hint of folk to his typical indie-pop sound, combining the melodies and storytelling of the genre with contemporary indie instrumentation. \"String Lights\" simultaneously reflects and reinvents the mid-2000s era of Fleet Foxes, Iron & Wine, The Lumineers, and all the other songs that make you want to road trip through the Pacific Northwest with the windows down. The track's instrumentation is simple - keys that crescendo into acoustic guitars, violins, and drums - but simple is exactly what a song like this needs. It allows for McPoland's affecting vocals to shine through.\n\nMcPoland has a special way of connecting with his listeners through his voice. He sings with a powerful authenticity that is rare to come across these days. You can feel his emotion through each inflection, especially during the chorus, \"Maybe it all might make sense / When Iâ€™ve learned to mean what I meant / Well everything ends.\"\n\nWatch the \"String Lights\" lyric video below:"
