Whatever value the anaglyphs have is due to Yuri's insights and guidance. Flaws are my doing. Briefly, panorama stitching software Hugin is used to create both non-stereo pan assemblies and remapped versions of the images. The latter are then made into anaglyphs using GIMP. The individual remapped images are linked from the corresponding Library entries for the original frames. The remapped images can be used to create stereo views using other methods.\n\nFor those interested in the subject of Apollo Photography and the Color of the Moon, see a brief discussion written for the ALSJ by Michael Light.\n\nJournal Contributor Paul White has made detailed comparisons of cloud patterns seen in a large number of Apollo images with imagery taken at close to the same time by various meteorlogical satellites.\n\nThis Apollo 15 Image Library contains all of the pictures taken on the lunar surface by the astronauts together with pictures from pre-flight training and pictures of equipment and the flight hardware. High-resolution version of many of the lunar surface images are included. A source for both thumbnail and low -resolution versions of the lunar surface images is a website compiled by Paul Spudis and colleagues at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n\nSections:\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nAssembled Panoramas\n\nAnaglyphs (reb-blue stereo)\n\nCrew and Equipment Pre-Flight\n\nVehicle Assembly, Transport, and Checkout on the Launch Pad\n\nSaturn V Launch\n\nMission Support Photos\n\nMission Photos by Magazine Number\n\nMagazine 81/QQ (B&W) Orbital\n\nMagazine 82/SS (B&W) EVA-3\n\nMagazine 84/MM (B&W) 500mm: SEVA, EVA-1 and 2\n\nMagazine 85/LL (B&W) SEVA, pre-EVA-1, EVA-1 and 2\n\nMagazine 86/NN (Color) EVA-1 and 2\n\nMagazine 87/KK (Color) SEVA and EVA-2\n\nMagazine 88/TT (Color) EVA-3\n\nMagazine 89/WW (B&W) 500mm EVA-3\n\nMagazine 90/PP (B&W) EVA-2\n\nMagazine 91/M (Color) Translunar Coast\n\nMagazine 92/OO (B&W) EVA-2\n\nMagazine 93/P (Color) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 94/S (B&W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 95/RR (B&W) Lunar Orbit; Transearth Coast\n\nMagazine 96/Q (Color) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 97/O (Color) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 98/R (B&W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 99/N (B&W) Earth Orbit; translunar Coast\n\nRecovery and Post-Flight Photos\n\nMission Report Figures\n\nPreliminary Science Report Figures\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nOblique View\n\nRed-Blue Anaglyph of the ALSEP, LM, LRV (0.3 Mb\n\nPatrick Vantuyne has combined M119829425L and M119822622L. The separation exaggerates crater depths. In a black-and-white detail from Dave's color SEVA pan, Index Crater in the foreground to the right of up-Sun. The pan was taken starting at about 106:58:27, which was about 0033 UTC on 31 July 1971. At that time, the solar elevation and azimuth were 13.1 and 96.6. The eastern rim of the crater did not cast a shadow at that time, indicating that the inner eastern wall is shallower than 13.1 degrees. Another LROC image, M131623862L, was taken 2156 UTC on 19 June 2010 when the solar elevation was 8.4 degrees. At that time, the eastern half of the crater was nearly filled with shadow, indicating that the inner slope is close to 8.4 degrees. Note that the western rims of some of the small, sharp-rimmed craters within the eastern half of Index are sun lit, another indication that the solar elevation is close to the inner slope.\n\n20 July 2011 23:05:01 UTC; image M165842369R; Solar El/Az 19.1/259.1; Full-image center Lat/Long 26.11/3.44; sub-LRO Lat/Long 26.11/0.66; LRO altitude 44 km, resolution 1.66 (width)/0.55(height m/pixel ( 300 Mb TIFF)\n\nThis labelled image was downloaded from the LROC site.

Scan from the original film courtesy NASA/JSC/Arizona State University.\n\nRev. 38 Pan Camera Frame 9798, LM Detail ( 346k )\n\nStephen Tellier scanned a portion of Pan Camera frame 9798, which was taken during CSM Rev 38 at about 151:37. At that time, Dave and Jim were in the LM after the completion of EVA-2. A prominent feature of this image is the darkening of the soil around the LM and along a corridor extending from the LM toward 11 o'clock. See a comparison with frame 9377 by Markus Mehring, who has processed the images to account for differing orientations, different scales due to differing CSM-LM ranges, and different foreshortening due to differing CSM elevation angles. As Jack Schmitt discusses in the Apollo 17 commentary, the surface around the LM became brighter after being swept by the descent engine exhaust. As can be seen in photos taken on the surface, areas subsequently disturbed by the astronauts became relatively dark again. At locations relatively far from the LM, disturbed soil had the same brightness as undisturbed soil, another indication of brightening due to the engine exhaust.\n\nRev. 50 Pan Camera 9809, North Detail ( 332k )\n\nThis detail from Pan Camera frame 9809 was taken during CSM Rev 50 at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 175:30, two revs after LM liftoff. It shows the area from the LM in the north to Arbeit Crater in the south and from the eastern rim of Hadley Rille in the west to Luke Crater in the east. Compare a detail showing the area around the LM with similar details from the earlier pan camera frames. The immediate area around the spacecraft has been swept by engine exhaust for a second time; insulation from the descent stage was scattered around the area following staging and ignition; and there is no Ascent stage to cast a shadow.\n\nRev. 50 Pan Camera 9809, Center Detail ( 288k )\n\nThis detail from Pan Camera frame 9809 shows the area from the Arbeit Crater in the north to Dune Crater in the south.\n\nRev. 50 Pan Camera 9809, South Detail ( 260k )\n\nThis detail from Pan Camera frame 9809 shows the area from the Dune Crater and Elbow Crater in the north to the Station 6 crater in the south.\n\nRev. 50 Pan Camera 9814 ( 716k )\n\nThis frame was taken two revs after LM crew's liftoff in the ascent stage and shortly after 9809 was taken. The LM descent can be seen near the center of a detail.\n\nApollo 15 Planned CSM Ground Track from LOI to LM Landing ( 2.3 Mb )\n\nGround Tracks for Revs 1 and 14.

Scans organized by Ken Glover from a chart provided by David Portree, USGS Flagstaff\n\nSelene/Kaguya Image of the Landing Site ( 60k )\n\nAs can be seen from the shadows in the craters, this image was taken with the Sun low in the west. Researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) present a version ( 33k ) with a realtively bright area near the known location of the LM outlined in red. The LM landed on the northwest rim of a shallow crater. A comparison ( 152k ) between a detail from Apollo 15 Pan Camera frame 9377 and the Selene/Kaguya image shows that, in the Apollo image, the western portion of the crater interior is bright while in the Selene/Kaguya image, the eastern portion is bright. It seems likely that this difference is due to illumination from the east in the case of the Apollo image and from the west in the case of the Selene/Kaguya image. In both images, the sunlit portion of the crater interior is brighter than other shallow craters in the area, suggesting that the surface layer throughout the crater was brightened by the LM engine exhaust and that the apparent degree of brightening depends on sun angle.\n\nPre-Flight Site Sketch ( 216k )\n\nThis pre-flight sketch shows the site from the viewpoint of an observer at an altitude of a few thousand feet above a point well north of the planned landing spot. Note that, for each of the traverses, there are broad target areas where specific sampling sites are to be picked in real-time by the crew. For example, on EVA-1, two stops were planned on the lower slopes of Mt. Hadley Delta but with Station 2 only being loosely defined as being in the western part of the hand-drawn ellipse and Station 3 being at the west end. Similarly, on EVA-3, the exact locations of Stations 9, 10 and 11 were going to be determined by the crew once they got to the edge of Hadley Rille.

In a 2005 e-mail, Dave Scott notes \"As I recall, this particular photo of the corvettes was taken out by the launch pad. The corvettes were stylized to essentially show the flag and set a bit of unit pride ...primarily to let the troops know that we were about and paying attention to all they were doing; e.g., at almost any level of the launch complex one could look down and recognize the crew's cars; we went to the pad often for various spacecraft activities as well as to just say hello to the folks putting the Saturn V and its payload together. Awareness, you know, something like the MFAP (Manned Flight Awareness Program, which awarded Snoopy pins to Apollo people who make special contributions. But promoting GM we were not; to own a car at the Cape was much more effective for us and less expensive to NASA than renting a car. Besides, they were fun to drive. I finally sold mine to Ed Fendell who I understand drove it many miles over many years.\" Scan by Ed Hengeveld, combining a scan of the cropped photograph as published and a scan of the distant vegitation and sky from whole-frame copy provided by Al Worden via Al Hallonquist. Hengeveld writes \"However, the overall quality was poorer than the published Life photo, so I PhotoShopped the two together, pasting the background into my Life scan.

For a detailed discussion of this and other mission patches, see Gene's Dorr's excellent Space Mission Patch website and Dick Lattimer's book, All We Did Was Fly to the Moon\". In the latter, Al Worden provides the following: \"The mission patch for Apollo 15 was basically designed by the Italian dress designer, Emilio Pucci. We had as a crew evaluated some 540 different designs for our crew patch. They appeared either too mechanical or to have nothing to do with the flight, so finally, through a mutual friend, we asked Pucci if he would help us with the design. Now, Pucci, as I best recall, was an aeronautical engineer and had a good feeling for flight. With his artistic nature, we felt that he would be very helpful in the patch design. He did send us a design which was basically the same as the patch we eventually used, however the colors were in the normal Pucci blues, purples, and greens. We took his design, changed it from a square to a circular patch, made it red, white and blue, and put a lunar background behind the three stylized birds that were the major Pucci contribution. The symbology is of three stylized birds flying over the lunar surface, each indicating one of us who were on the flight. The lunar surface behind the patch shows the landing site (next to Hadley Rille at the foot of the Appenine Mountains) and directly behind the stylized birds is a crater formation that spells '15' in Roman numerals (XV). You can also see from the stylized birds that they fly in formation with one on top and two closer to the lunar surface, indicating those who actually landed.\" As can be seen in a Life Magazine photograph of the crew in their color-coded Corvettes, Al's car is the same color - white - as his patch symbol.\n\nKSC-71P-340 ( 102k )\n\nApollo 15 Command Module, Service Module, and S-IVB adapter.
