        "text": "Peter Donat, the prolific character actor of the stage and screen who appeared in two films for Francis Ford Coppola and portrayed the father of Agent Fox Mulder on The X-Files, has died. He was 90.\n\nDonat died Monday of diabetes complications at his home in Point Reyes Station, California, his wife, Maria, told The New York Times.\n\nThe Canadian-born Donat was inspired to become an actor by his uncle, British star Robert Donat, who was known for his performances in such films as Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps (1935) and, in an Oscar-winning role, Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939).\n\nPeter Donat was married to Michael Learned, the matriarch of CBS’ The Waltons, from 1956 until their divorce in 1972. They met when both were in the company of the Connecticut Shakespeare Festival. (Also there at the time: Christopher Plummer, Raymond Massey, Roddy McDowall and Hurd Hatfield.)\n\nHe and Learned got to know Coppola at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and the filmmaker went on to employ Donat as the lawyer Questadt in The Godfather: Part II (1974) and as an attorney in Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988).\n\nDonat was considered for the role of the consigliere Tom Hagen in the first Godfather, but that part, of course, went to Robert Duvall.\n\nDonat also had a regular role as a Florida newspaperman from 1980-82 on NBC’s Flamingo Road, starring Morgan Fairchild and Howard Duff. And on CBS’ Dallas, a more famous primetime soap, he played the doctor who treated Larry Hagman’s character in 1980 in the resolution of that show’s “Who Shot J.R.?” cliffhanger.\n\nHis numerous guest-starring stints came on such series as I Spy, Medical Center, Banacek, Hawaii Five-O, Mannix, McMillan & Wife, Charlie’s Angels, Hill Street Blues, Harry O and Murder, She Wrote.\n\nHe showed up as William Mulder, the father of David Duchovny’s character, on six episodes of Fox’s The X-Files from 1995-99.\n\nBorn in Nova Scotia, Donat studied at the Yale School of Drama, appeared in 1953 on the NBC anthology program Robert Montgomery Presents and made his Broadway debut in 1957 in the British costume drama The First Gentleman, which earned him a Theater World Award.\n\nHe later worked on Broadway with Julie Harris in a revival of The Country Wife and in The Entertainer alongside Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright.\n\nOften playing slick, wealthy types, Donat appeared on the big screen with Michael Douglas in The China Syndrome (1979), The War of the Roses (1989) and The Game (1997) and in other films like My Old Man’s Place (1971), The Hindenburg (1975), F.I.S.T. (1978), Skin Deep (1989) and The Babe (1992)."
