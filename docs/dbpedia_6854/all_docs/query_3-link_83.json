        "text": "Tennessee Titans fans may not recognize the name \"T'Vondre Sweat\" just yet, but they will get to know the rookie very soon.\n\nThe defensive lineman came to Tennessee at 6'4\" and weighing 366 lbs. He will play in his first preseason game Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" says Sweat. \"This is football you know. I do this for a living. Preseason, whatever, it's going to be amazing and I can't wait to run out of that tunnel.\"\n\nSweat was the Titans' second-round draft pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, and while he missed organized team activities in the spring because of a minor injury, Sweat has made sure to make his presence known during training camp.\n\n\"He's exceeded my expectations honestly,\" says Titans' offensive lineman Peter Skoronski. \"He's gotten after it in the run game and the passing game too. There's not a lot of guys that have that size and speed.\"\n\nSweat is a self-proclaimed \"mama's boy.\" He says his mother sacrificed a lot for him growing up, and he wouldn't be where he is today without her help and support.\n\nSweat returned the favor by buying his mother \" .\"\n\n\"I worked hard to get this opportunity to give her a house and she finally got her dream home,\" says Sweat.\n\nTitans will face the 49ers Saturday at 6 p.m. at Nissan Stadium for their first of three preseason games."
