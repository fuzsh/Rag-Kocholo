        "text": "The Canadian tenor Jon Vickers, who brought a colossal voice and raw dramatic intensity to everything he sang, including legendary portrayals of Wagner’s Tristan, Verdi’s Otello, Beethoven’s Florestan and Britten’s Peter Grimes, died on Friday in Ontario, Canada. He was 88.\n\nThe Royal Opera House in London posted a statement from the Vickers family saying the cause was Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nFrom his early teens, when his robust singing in his family church in Saskatchewan was the talk of the congregation (parishioners remember his final high note in the hymn “Jerusalem” almost rattling the windows), until his fledgling appearances in the mid-1950s at the Toronto Opera Festival, the sheer size of Mr. Vickers’s voice was both the glory and the challenge of his artistry.\n\nIn dramatic tenor roles demanding stirring power and stamina Mr. Vickers had few rivals. Yet, even in subdued passages, whether posing questions as the clueless title character of Wagner’s “Parsifal” or singing tender phrases of a Schubert song, Mr. Vickers’s voice had penetrating body and depth. For all his power, he was a master at singing high pianissimo phrases with ethereal beauty.\n\nMaking every word he sang matter was another hallmark of his artistry. Mr. Vickers was incapable of fudging a text for the sake of vocal effect, a priority he traced to his Christian upbringing, in which hymns and prayers were revered.\n\nStill, Mr. Vickers had his share of detractors, who found his singing burly and gruff.\n\nHe identified intensely with the characters he portrayed, especially misfits, like Peter Grimes, and misunderstood heroes, like Verdi’s Otello, who are outwardly strong but struggling against brutal destinies. Yet he readily admitted that in taking risks and giving his all, his singing could be inconsistent and uncontrolled.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
