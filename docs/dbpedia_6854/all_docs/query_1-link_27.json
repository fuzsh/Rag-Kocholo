        "text": "Raw meat is safe for dogs – Dr Geoff Johnson\n\n“People consistently came back to me saying their dog looked brighter”\n\nWhen asked why he preferred raw feeding, Dr. Geoff Johnson, vet surgeon, expressed that, at first, he was very hesitant to feed chicken bones to his dogs.\n\nHe used to believe that raw bones would puncture the dogs’ guts, which would eventually lead to their death. However, a colleague of his explained that since dogs have been eating raw chicken for millions of years, raw meat is, in fact, safe for them.\n\nTo test his colleague’s advice, Dr Johnson personally fed raw chicken bones to his dogs, and after a period of observation, he concluded that raw diet was not harmful to them. This led him to advise his clients to do the same.\n\nAlthough only two firms produced raw dog food when he started advocating for it 25 years ago, he explained:\n\n“The reason I kept on doing it is people consistently came back and said their dog was brighter. And the coat is probably the thing you see changing first. Though maybe if I lived with a dog, I might say its character changed first.”\n\nDr. Geoff Johnson\n\nAre you a beginner? Learn more about raw dog food diets.\n\nDogs are biologically wired to eat raw meat – Dr Brendan Clarke\n\nDr. Brendan Clarke, Head Veterinary Surgeon at Towerwood Vets and past-president of the Raw Feeding Veterinary Society, explained that he believes a raw diet is the most biologically appropriate way to feed animals.\n\n“Be biologically appropriate, he explained, “If you go back to the anatomy and the physiology, actually, very little has changed. You’ve got a jaw that can not dislocate and grind side to side. How on earth is that going to digest vegetable matter?”\n\nDr. Brendan Clarke\n\nRaw feeding is the most appropriate feeding methodology – Dr Peter Gregory\n\nDr. Peter Gregory shared the same view. He recommended raw feeding as the most appropriate feeding methodology. He said:\n\n“It became clear early on in my homeopathic career that modern feeding methods were an obstacle to cure and needed to be altered. And raw feeding is the way animals should be fed, or the pet animals I deal with, maybe dogs and cats. Their natural diet is meat, bones…”\n\nDr. Peter Gregory"
