        "text": "Denise Smith recently asked what school supplies she could provide for a Spotsylvania County program that helps students in need.\n\n“I thought they’d ask for a few items, but they’re completely out of everything on the list,” she said. “To me, that says they have a lot of families they’re having to support.”\n\nSmith is an associate broker with Century 21 Redwood Realty at Spotsylvania Courthouse — and among the army of people in the Fredericksburg region who are marshalling resources for students returning to class.\n\nThere have always been back-to-school drives to provide essential supplies, but those involved with this year’s efforts say the needs seem to be more widespread as prices for basic school items have risen like everything else.\n\n“Coming off the heels of the summer we’ve had, how hot it’s been, people are struggling to keep up with electric bills. They’re trying to keep their lights on and keep the air conditioning going,” said Nick Vosburg, a financial trainer at the Rappahannock United Way. “Buying (school) paper is the least of their problems right now.”\n\nThat’s why the United Way held a sort-of-thon of school supplies last week. Almost 50 volunteers from businesses, along with parents and their children, separated donated books and bags, crayons and colored highlighters into piles. They packed more than 4,000 items in 236 bags to be distributed at Stafford Junction, a nonprofit that provides free programs to low-income families.\n\nTeresa Coppage of Spotsylvania County was among the sorters, along with her spouse, kids and neighbors.\n\n“I think it’s great because there are a lot of parents who can’t afford school supplies,” she said. “With the community helping out, this gives the kids a chance to walk into school with something and not empty-handed.”\n\nMore for the basics\n\nSince the late 2010s, Smith has led her company’s campaign to provide classroom supplies, hygiene items, laundry detergent and other must-haves for students and their families who may be homeless, living in hotels or struggling financially.\n\nThe items are warehoused at the Treasure House, in a trailer behind Massaponax High School. Each summer before students go back to class, the Treasure House stockpiles every school in Spotsylvania with items that have been donated from “Stuff the Bus” or similar efforts held by local law enforcement officers, businesses, service groups and nonprofits.\n\nThen, families are able to “shop” throughout the year for needed items, said Michelle Swisher, a school social worker who runs the program.\n\n“There is definitely an increase in need,” she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhen Swisher first set up in the trailer in 2012, after handing out supplies from the back of her car, she served maybe 50 people every three months. Last school year, Treasure House helped 1,000 people per quarter, she said.\n\nThe reasons for the increase are varied, but Swisher believes it all goes back to the “economics of the world.” The lack of affordable housing in the Fredericksburg area leads to higher rents, and “everything kind of trickles down from there,” she said.\n\nFamilies who were paying $1,500 a month for a place are facing rents of $1,800 or $1,900, Vosburg said, and their wages haven’t gone up accordingly.\n\n“It’s taking more and more money to pay for the same amount of things,” said Claudia Sisk, another financial coach at the United Way. “There’s not a lot of money left over for school supplies and school clothes and things like that.”\n\n‘Can be exorbitant’\n\nWhen people shop for the list of items required in each classroom, there can be a bit of sticker shock.\n\n“Holy moly, the price of school supplies this year is crazy,” said Sarah Frederick, one of the owners of Whole Greens, an alternative health and wellness store in Spotsylvania.\n\nShe and her partners park an old school bus on U.S. 1 and encourage local businesses to “buy” a bus seat for $25. The names of the buyers are hung on bus windows for all to see, then Whole Greens matches each donation. The effort typically raises more than $2,500 per bus, and in years past, owners could buy eight to 10 shopping carts of school supplies with the money.\n\nFrederick’s not sure how far the donations will go this year. Along with the basic binders, leaf paper and composition notebooks, students need earphones for the all the electronics used in classes.\n\nSchools don’t want the less-expensive ear buds, which younger students can easily lose, but more expensive over-the-head types which can cost up to $20 each for sturdier models.\n\nBut then, Frederick saw a pack of glue sticks for more than $4 and let out another “holy moly.”\n\n“The costs can be exorbitant if you’re buying backpacks for three children, just a three-ring binder is a lot of money,” said Swisher, remembering paying as much as $120 for the scientific calculator her children needed in high school.\n\nWhile the need for school supplies has increased in the Fredericksburg area, so has the response. At Century 21, Smith expected there’d be a struggle to fill everything on the Treasure House list. The company ended up with more than $3,000 in donations and 50 stuffed backpacks.\n\n“Honestly, I’m pleasantly surprised at how much everyone has stepped up to donate and I feel like we’re actually getting more than we anticipated,” Smith said.\n\nCathy Dyson: 540/374-5425\n\ncdyson@freelancestar.com\n\n\"It’s taking more and more money to pay for the same amount of things.
