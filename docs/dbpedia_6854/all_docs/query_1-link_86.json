You'll discover:\n\n• Why you need to change your workout program\n\n• The reason you may not be a hard gainer\n\n• The truth about protein\n\n• The most effective muscle building raw foods\n\n• How the old time strongmen got so strong\n\n• Peter's personal workout program\n\n• What foods to put into your grocery cart\n\n• Certain \"Must-Take\" supplements\n\n• 44 muscle building recipes\n\n• A bonus interview with Peter Ragnar\n\n• And Much, Much More!\n\nEnjoy many wonderful, tasty, healthy, raw food recipes inside!\n\nJUST WHEN I BEGAN TO DOUBT YOU COULD EVER BUILD MUSCLE ON A RAW FOOD DIET…\n\nPerhaps I should back up a bit. You see, conventional nutritional experts proclaimed I’d never get enough protein or calories on a raw food diet. They believed I’d become vitamin-deficient, that I wouldn’t be able to break down or properly digest such foods. In fact, they thought I’d get so skinny, I’d blow away in the wind.\n\nImages of the old Charles Atlas ad of the 1940s danced in my head. I don’t know if you’re old enough to remember, but it’s the one where the 98-pound weakling gets sand kicked in his face. Well, of course that was silly once I realized how powerful nature’s diet really was.\n\nLet me introduce myself: my name is Peter Ragnar, and by all odds, as a pre-baby boomer, I shouldn’t be packing on muscle with any diet, let alone shattering athletic records on raw foods. What’s the secret?\n\nThe secret is, any amount of the foods I tell you about in this e-book will help you get into better shape and greatly improve your fitness levels. Through exhaustive research, I discovered that, according to scientists, 98% of the molecules in the human body are replaced in 12 months—but only if specific minerals are present. Naturally, I made certain that I ate foods rich in them on a regular basis. You’ll also be getting my secret recipes, so you can make these simple dishes yourself.\n\nThere are four particular exercises that you’ll want to include in your workouts. You could eat a cow a day and still struggle to make the gains these four exercises will give you. In the e-book, you’re about to discover just how much protein you really need. I’ll show you why too much protein is toxic. Did you know that undigested protein creates amyloid plaque that can cause all types of joint and muscle pains? It’s also suspected as a cause of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nNo one wants to lose muscle they’ve worked hard to gain and see it replaced by fat. That’s called sarcopenia—a common ailment associated with aging. However, there’s one mineral you can get from juicing greens that will help prevent it. I’ll help you get your juicer out for that one.\n\nWhat really helped me and will help you pack on the muscle is the amino acid glutamine, because it helps your muscles utilize and metabolize protein. Also, having enough arginine (another amino acid) in your system before bedtime triggers growth hormone release while you sleep. There’s an entire recipe section included in the e-book to help you get enough of these amino acids.\n\nIf you’re concerned about your body fat, then you’ll want to include kale in your diet. Kale acts like soap on fat cells, washing them from your body. It might be encouraging for you to know that my body fat is around 5%, and yours can be also. You can accomplish this by diet and exercise alone. In fact, did you know that you’ll have a 600% better chance of living to 100 than those folks who don’t exercise? Now, just add the raw food diet laid out in this e-book to your daily routine, and who knows what you’ll be able to accomplish!"
