        "text": "Since 1979, mountaineering rangers in Talkeetna have written reports of that year's mountaineering season. These reports are available by year, below.\n\nNearly every year, these reports contain overall statistics on the number of expeditions and mountaineers attempting a climb, as well as a total number of summits, broken down by the route climbed on Denali. Download these mountaineering statistics, which have been compiled into one file.\n\nNote: These reports are historical. Keep in mind that certain references are contemporary to the report itself (e.g., calling the mountain \"Mount McKinley\" instead of \"Denali,\" old lists of guiding companies or advice on waste disposal that is no longer correct). For current information on planning a mountaineering trip on Denali or Mount Foraker, please check out our mountaineering info.\n\nAnnual Report: 1990\n\nHeavy winter snows, volcanic ash deposits, near record numbers of climbers, few accidents and generally good weather summarizes the 1990 mountaineering season in the Alaska Range.\n\nRecord snows fell at the lower elevations during the winter of 1989-90. There was one winter attempt made by a Japanese team of four on the West Buttress. They encountered extended periods of poor weather and spent nearly 20 days between the 11,000’ and 14,300’ camps. The 14,300’ basin was their highest camp. No other winter attempts were made on any other major peak within Denali National Park and Preserve. Throughout most of the winter, Mount Redoubt volcano, located approximately 150 miles south of the Alaska Range, repeatedly erupted, lightly dusting the Alaska Range with multiple layers of volcanic ash. A similar scenario occurred in 1986 when Mount Augustine erupted. The dark ash layers, once exposed to radiant heat from the sun, caused greatly accelerated melting of the snow pack as well as uneven melting of the snow surface. This resulted in an early closure of aircraft landing strips on the glaciers. Concern over a repeat of the 1986 early closures was well publicized and a number of groups planning late expeditions to the Alaska Range either moved their trips ahead or cancelled altogether. Late June snows extended the season longer than was expected, nevertheless, flights into the southeast fork stopped after the first several days of July. In an effort to cope with the number of people still on the mountain, landings to pick up parties were authorized at the 9,500’ level on the Kahiltna Glacier. No dropoffs were permitted at this location.\n\nThe Denali Medical Research Project did not operate during the 1990 season. In its place, the Park Service mountaineering staff established a camp at the traditional site at 14,300’ on the West Buttress. From that medical/rescue camp, the mountaineering rangers contacted mountaineers and coordinated search and rescue activities.\n\nDespite the near record number of climbers on the mountain, there were only three search and rescue incidents on Mount McKinley in which the National Park Service was involved. This is the lowest number of search and rescue incidents since 1975 when 362 persons registered to climb Mount McKinley.\n\nThe National Park Service conducted four 24-day patrols on Mount McKinley, as well as numerous patrols into other areas of the Alaska Range. We continue to staff a ranger station in the town of Talkeetna where mountaineers register for their expeditions. A strong emphasis is placed upon the importance of environmentally sound expeditionary climbing and sanitation techniques. Additionally, mountaineers are encouraged to remain self-sufficient and conduct their own evacuations whenever possible.\n\nAll statistics in this report are for portions of the Alaska Range within the boundaries of Denali National Park and Preserve. Where specifically noted, statistics apply only for Mount McKinley *\n\nInteresting Statistics\n\nNear Record Number Of Climbers On Mount McKinley\n\nIn 1990, 1002 persons attempted a climb of Mount McKinley. This was only seven people short of the record of 1009 set in 1989. Had the volcanic ash situation not forced a number of parties to cancel their expedition, 1990 would probably have continued the four-year trend of increasing use.\n\nSuccess Rate\n\n573 (57%) of those attempting the summit of Mount McKinley were successful.\n\nThis season saw a flurry of activity on Mount Foraker. A total of 11 expeditions attempted seven different routes. One new route was established. Six out of 28 climbers (21%) attempting Mount Foraker reached the summit.\n\n13 expeditions attempted four routes on Mount Hunter. Eight out of the 44 climbers (18%) attempting Mount Hunter reached the summit.\n\nRecord Number of Climbers on Mount McKinley During A Given Week\n\nA new all time high of 383 climbers were on the slopes of Mount McKinley for the week of May 20. 1990.\n\nNew Altitude For Mount McKinley?\n\nOn June 21, 1989, a team of researchers and support climbers reached the summit of Mount McKinley. They carried a Global Positioning System receiver that when used in conjunction with a Global Positioning Satellite, can measure geographical heights. Preliminary indications show the elevation of Mount McKinley to be 14’ lower than the height previously measured by more traditional survey methods. The newly computed height of 20,306’ is still not yet official, so at least for the time being, the previous height of 20,320’ remains the official height of Mount McKinley.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness\n\n143 (14%) had symptoms, of these:\n\n105 (73%) were mild\n\n31 (22%) were moderate\n\n7 (5%) were severe\n\nFrostbite\n\n30 (3%) reported some degree of frostbite. Of these:\n\n22 (73%) were mild\n\n5 (16%) required doctors care\n\n3 (10%) required hospitalization\n\nWest Buttress Route\n\n711 (71%) of the climbers on Mount McKinley were on the popular West Buttress route. This is a significant decrease from the past several years where approximately 85% of the climbers were on the West Buttress.\n\nSoloists\n\n15 (1.5%) persons registered for solo climbs this season. Seven reported successfully reaching the summit. One of the soloists miraculously survived and was able to extricate himself following a 40’ crevasse fall.\n\nMountain Guiding\n\n342 (34%) of the climbers on Mount McKinley traveled with one of the authorized guiding companies. The overall success rate of the guided groups was 54%. The majority of these trips occurred on the West Buttress route, but other guided trips attempted the West Buttress - Muldrow Glacier Traverse, Muldrow Glacier, West Rib, South Buttress and Cassin Ridge.\n\nForeign Climbers\n\n337 (34%) of the climbers on Mount McKinley were from foreign countries. 29 nationalities were represented:\n\nNew Low Temperature Reading\n\nThe National Park Service maintains a minimum recording thermometer, supplied by the National Weather Service, at the 17,200’ level on the West Buttress Route. The winter of 1989-90’s coldest recorded temperature was -57 degrees F.\n\nNew Routes and Interesting Activities\n\nDenali\n\nIn May, Canadians Timo Saukko and Peter Mattson climbed a new variation of the West Buttress Direct. The route lies just south of Thunder Ridge.\n\nAlso in May, Canadians Ross Clouthier, Mario Bilodoau and Mike Kurth climbed another variation of the West Buttress Direct. Their route was just north of the southwest ridge.\n\nIn May, a French team parasailed from the 15,000’ level on the West Buttress to within one hour walk of the Southeast Fork base camp (7,000’).\n\nIn May, a guided group led by Michael Covington traversed off the upper Cassin Ridge and crossed over the connecting snow/ice slopes to the West Rib.\n\nOn May 23, a strong and well-acclimatized Russian climber, Anatoyla Burkreuv, climbed the West Rib from its beginning at 11,000’ on the Northeast Fork to the south summit in 10 1/2 hours.\n\nIn June, Alaskan Norma Jean Saunders became the first woman to officially document a solo ascent of Mount McKinley. She climbed the West Buttress.\n\nIn July, British climbers Simon Abrahams and James Hall completed the first alpine style ascent of the complete South Buttress. They continued down the Muldrow Glacier and out to Wonder Lake.\n\nMount Foraker\n\nIn May, Americans John Phelan and Dave Charman climbed a new route on the southeast face. They named the route “False Dawn”.\n\nAlso in May, Dave Harries and Chris Smith completed the second ascent of the “Pink Panther” route.\n\nMount Wake, Ruth Gorge\n\nIn May, Canadians Chris Atkinson and Bruce Kay climbed a new route they named the “Screaming Blue Messiah” on the east spur.\n\nPeak 6800’ “Werewolf”, Ruth Gorge\n\nOn July 14, Austrians Andi Orgler and Michael Rutter climbed a new route on the west pillar. It was reported to consist of 20 pitches of 5.10+ Al.\n\nPeak 7500’ “London”, Ruth Gorge\n\nOn July 18, Austrians Hannes Arch and Helmut Neswadba climbed a new route on the west pillar called “Big Time”. It was reported to consist of 20 pitches of 5.11+ A2.\n\nPeak 7979’ “Balrock”, Ruth Gorge\n\nOn July 14, Arch and Neswadba climbed a new route on the Southwest Ridge. It consisted of four pitches of 5.7.\n\nMount Dan Beard, Ruth Amphitheater\n\nIn May, two Alaskan women, Carol Snetsinger and Don McDonald climbed a new route in the west face couloir.\n\nAccidents/Incidents\n\nThe following incidents are the more significant accidents or incidents that occurred in 1990:\n\nFall With Injuries; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn April 9th, two Alaskan mountaineers were ascending the southeast spur of Mount Deception. The two had just completed a rest stop. The lead climber, Gary Donofrio, started up the ridge while the second, Jim Bouchard, completed packing his pack. They were roped together with a 50 meter rope. Before a belay was provided to Donofrio, a huge section of cornice broke from beneath him. Donofrio began a tumbling fall down a 75 degree slope. The fracture line had extended back to within two feet of Bouchard. Both men’s ice axes were lost. The only option left to Bouchard to arrest the fall and prevent being pulled off the ridge himself, was to jump off the opposite side of the ridge. This he did and was able to stop Donofrio’s fall. Bouchard was able to eventually haul Donofrio back up to the ridge. During the fall Donofrio had suffered internal injuries and had lost his pack. During the next 10 hours, the pair slowly made their way back to their base camp at the 5700’ level on the Eldridge Glacier. The following day, Bouchard skied approximately 28 miles to the Parks Highway to report the accident. Donofrio was evacuated by the mountaineering rangers and an US Army Chinook Helicopter later that evening.\n\nInjury From Falling Rock; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn May 26, Dwight Percy and other members of the expedition called “The Fine Young Idiots” were traversing around Windy Corner at the 12,500’ level on the West Buttress of Mount McKinley when Percy was struck by a football sized rock which fell from the West Buttress. While the other members of the expedition carried his gear, Percy was able to continue to ascend to the 14,300’ medical/rescue camp. There the group camped for four days while Percy attempted to recuperate in hopes he could recover enough to descend under his own power. During those four days, Percy remained stable but did not improve. On May 31st, Percy was evacuated by helicopter. X-rays revealed he had sustained fractures of the left illium and the pelvic ramis bone.\n\nFalls; Fatalities\n\nOn May 24th, the American two person “Washington Square” expedition left the Southeast Fork base camp for an ascent of the Cassin Ridge. The men, Michael Koshuta and Stuart Jones, were last seen on the Cassin Ridge at the 15,700’ level on June 1st. They were listed as overdue on June 9th. Air searches began on the 10th. Their bodies were located by air search teams on June 12th. It appears the men attempted to traverse from the upper Cassin to the West Rib when one or both slipped. The men died in the resulting fall. There had been severe weather shortly after they were last seen on June 1st. It is thought that the men attempted to reach the 16,200’ level on the West Rib via a long and tedious, moderate angle, mixed snow/ice traverse from the upper Cassin. From this point, the safety of the 14,300’ basin and medical/rescue camp on the West Buttress can generally be reached.\n\nOpen Bivouac; HAPE Fatality; Frostbite; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn May 25th, the seven person Japanese “KTK” expedition flew onto the Southeast Fork base camp for a climb of the West Rib of Mount McKinley. On June 9th, the team was at their high camp at 18,000’ on the West Rib. They departed that camp intending to push for the summit with minimal gear and return to their camp later in the day. By the time the team reached the junction of the West Buttress at 19,500’, expedition member Hiroaki Ito was suffering from a bad cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in walking. By mutual consent, Ito was left at 19,500’ while the rest of the expedition continued on to the summit. Once the team reached the summit, the weather rapidly deteriorated to white-out conditions. During the descent, two of the summit team became disoriented and continued down the West Buttress past the junction of the West Rib and Ito. The rest of the team located Ito, whose condition had significantly deteriorated. Unfortunately, these team members with Ito thought that the two missing team members were still lost on the upper mountain. The decision was made to remain at the junction, making noise, attempting to attract the missing climbers. Meanwhile, the two ‘missing” team members had joined an American party and had begun a descent of the West Buttress. These two Japanese continued their descent and reached the 14,300’ medical rescue camp late that night. Higher on the mountain, the weather, Ito’s and the remaining team members’ conditions all gradually deteriorated until further descent was impossible. Rescue teams began moving upward the next morning. Even though weather had somewhat improved, the Japanese were unable to drag Ito. Their leader remained with Ito while the others, badly frostbitten, began to descend the West Buttress. By the afternoon, weather had improved enough that the NPS attempted air drops of oxygen and equipment. As the leader was retrieving the supplies, Mr. Ito died from advanced pulmonary edema. The rescue team arrived shortly thereafter. The three Japanese who bivouacked with Ito suffered severe frostbite, were evacuated by helicopter and eventually lost nearly all their toes. There were other incidents of altitude illness and frostbite this season. Most of these were treated at the medical/rescue camp at the 14,300’ basin on the West Buttress.\n\nTrends and Items of Special Concern\n\nSolo ascents: This year 15 persons registered solo…. two fewer than in 1989. Some of these were able to team with other expeditions at least to traverse the heavily crevassed portions of the lower glaciers. One soloist miraculously survived an unprotected 40’ crevasse fall.\n\nIncreasing use: For the previous four years we have had new records set for the number of climbers attempting to climb Mount McKinley. It is likely 1990 would have continued this trend had the volcanic ash not forced the cancellation of certain expeditions. In 1990, climbers spent a total of more than 18,865 user days on Mount McKinley alone! Over 12,823 of them were on the West Buttress. The use on the West Buttress is even higher when considering many other routes are accessed via the lower West Buttress route. For example, an additional 3,262 user days were spent by mountaineers completing either the West Buttress to the Muldrow Glacier traverse or from the Muldrow Glacier to the Kahiltna Glacier.\n\nSanitation: With the increasing use, it is more important than ever for mountaineers to properly dispose of their human waste to prevent the contamination of snow that might be melted and used for drinking or cooking water by future expeditions. We are still suggesting the use of plastic bags as latrines. When moving camp, tie the bags off and toss into a deep crevasse. The use of biodegradable plastic bags is recommended. Use the latrines in the camps where they are provided.\n\nTrash: Many expeditions are hauling their trash to base camp where it is flown off the mountain. Still others continue to crevasse their trash. Trash accumulation on other popular mountains of the world has recently received considerable publicity. Trash dumps and appalling sanitation conditions at the more popular campsites in the Himalayas, Europe, South America and elsewhere threaten human health, degrade the mountaineering experience and threaten the mountain environment. Mountaineers from all nationalities must take the responsibility for, and the initiative in, preserving the quality of the world’s mountain environments. A combination of education, leading by example, and peer pressure are probably the most effective tools that can be brought to bear against less considerate mountaineers.\n\nAdministrative notes for 1990:\n\nThe 1990 South District staff consisted of:\n\nLead ranger: Bob Seibert\n\nMountaineering rangers: Scott Gill, Renny Jackson, Ron Johnson and Roger Robinson\n\nStudent Conservation Association intern Kevin Moore\n\nA portable radio repeater was installed in the Ramparts, the rugged mountains west of the lower Kahiltna Glacier. It proved extremely successful in improving communications between the Talkeetna Ranger Station and the mountaineering patrols. The repeater was removed later during the summer.\n\nThe National Park Service, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, conducted a survey of approximately one third of the mountaineers registering for Alaska Range climbs within Denali National Park. The purpose of the survey was to determine users’ perceptions of sanitation, trash and crowding issues on Mount McKinley. The results of the survey will be published in the 1991 American Alpine Journal. For the first time, mountaineering registrations were entered into a data base to allow better investigation of trends and more efficient daily management of the registration process.\n\nIn July, construction began on a building to replace the house trailer that for years served as ranger station, quarters for the seasonal mountaineering staff, and search and rescue coordination center. The new building, which is now complete, will serve as seasonal quarters, winter office for the South District, and the search and rescue coordination center.\n\nProperty has been purchased in Talkeetna upon which a mountaineering contact center will eventually be constructed. This building will replace the current log cabin which the NPS is renting in downtown Talkeetna.\n\nThe war in the Persian Gulf will likely affect the 1991 mountaineering operation on Mount McKinley. In the past, the Denali Medical Research Project and the NPS have relied upon the US Army High Altitude Rescue Team from Ft. Wainwright, Alaska, to insert and extract the medical/rescue/research camp at the 14,300’ level on the West Buttress. Front this camp, high altitude physiological research has been conducted under the direction of Dr. Peter Hackett and his capable staff and rescues have been coordinated that have saved many lives. Initially, it appears that flight crew and equipment commitments to the war effort will preclude the Army’s ability to support either the medical/rescue camp or their ability to conduct high altitude rescue missions during the 1991 climbing season.\n\nThe National Park Service is planning to staff a small Weather Port at the 14,000’ basin on the West Buttress. This camp will primarily serve as a communication and coordination base for rescue incidents.\n\nAnnual Report: 1991\n\nThe 1991 mountaineering season on Denali began with a rumble as a major earthquake hit the range on April 30th. Measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, the epicenter was just south of Mount Foraker. Huge avalanches were observed throughout the range, as well as several reports of close calls among climbers. Luckily there were no injuries.\n\nThe winter of 1990-1991 was another heavy snow year in the Alaska Range. There were no winter attempts made on Mount McKinley. Weather in the spring was generally poor. An abundance of cold and stormy weather turned away most summit attempts until late May when a stretch of stable weather arrived. Still, the success rate remained low until another stretch of good weather in mid to late June brought the success rate up to its normal of 50% to 60%.\n\nThis year, in order to maintain safe, reliable, and timely air support for high altitude rescues on Mount McKinley, the National Park Service contracted an Aerospatiale Lama helicopter to be stationed in Talkeetna for the mountaineering season. Fortunately the Park Service was able to secure this contract this year, for U.S. Army Chinook helicopters were not available for high altitude rescues as they have been in years past.\n\nThe Lama was successfully used on five major rescue missions this year. It’s worthiness was especially proven after it completed two successful rescues above 18,000’, one of which required four landings in the “Football Field” at 19,500’. In addition, for the first time in Alaska, the Park Service implemented “short-haul” rescue using the Lama. This is a technique of inserting rescuers, that are clipped into a fixed line suspended beneath a helicopter, into rescue sites where it is not possible to land a helicopter nearby. Once victims have been stabilized for transport they are extracted from the rescue site in a similar manner. The Park Service plans to keep the Lama helicopter under contract and stationed in Talkeetna for at least the next two years.\n\nDue to the unavailability of air support from U.S. Army helicopters, the Denali Medical Research Project did not operate during the 1991 mountaineering season. However, the National Park Service maintained a camp at the 14,300’ basin on the West Buttress. Mountaineering rangers were able to provide emergency medical care, coordinate rescues, and base their patrols from this camp. The National Park Service conducted four, 24-day patrols on Mount McKinley, plus numerous other patrols in different parts of the Alaska Range. We continue to staff a ranger station in the town of Talkeetna where climbers register for their expeditions. Registration is required for all climbs and expeditions on Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker. Climbers headed to other areas in the South District of Denali National Park and Preserve are encouraged to register. A strong emphasis is placed upon the importance of environmentally sound expeditionary climbing and sanitation practices. Additionally, mountaineers must remain self-sufficient and conduct their own rescues whenever possible.\n\nAll statistics in this report are for portions of the Alaska Range within the boundaries of Denali National Park and Preserve. Unless specifically noted, statistics apply only for Mount McKinley.\n\nInteresting Statistics\n\nNumber of Climbers on Mount McKinley: In 1991, 935 climbers attempted to climb Mount McKinley. This is 63 fewer persons than attempted the climb in 1990. Although this is a drop of 6.3%, 935 climbers still represents a vast increase over the previous two decades:\n\nSuccess Rates\n\n57 (59%) of those attempting to climb Mount McKinley reached the summit.\n\n10 expeditions attempted six different routes on Mount Foraker. Four out of 28 climbers (14%) reached the summit of Mount Foraker.\n\n9 expeditions attempted Mount Hunter via five different routes. Five out of 24 climbers (21%) reached the summit.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness\n\n79 (8%) reported symptoms of AMS. Of these:\n\n60 (76 %) were mild\n\n16 (20 %) were moderate\n\n3 ( 4 %) were severe\n\nFrostbite\n\n43 (5%) reported some degree of frostbite. Of these:\n\n26 (60%) were mild\n\n11 (26%) required physician care\n\n6 (14%) required hospitalization\n\nWest Buttress Route\n\n680 (73%) of climbers on Mount McKinley attempted the West Buttress. This by far remains the most popular route on the mountain. It is interesting to note, however, that the percentage of’ climbers on the West Buttress route has dropped during the past two years. Typically 80-85% of the climbers on Mount McKinley attempt the West Buttress.\n\nSoloists\n\n14 (1.5%) persons attempted a solo climb of Mount McKinley. Eight reported reaching the summit, including two via the Cassin Ridge.\n\nMountain Guiding\n\n265 (28%) of climbers on Mount McKinley climbed with one of the seven authorized guide services. The success rate for the guided groups was 67%. Guided groups attempted the West Buttress, West Rib, Muldrow Glacier, and West Buttress - Muldrow Glacier Traverse.\n\nNationalities\n\n531 (57%) of the climbers on Mount McKinley were Americans.\n\n404 (43%) were from foreign countries. This represents a large increase in foreign climbers.\n\nThe average for the past ten years is 30%.\n\nA total of 28 nationalities were represented:\n\nNew Routes and Interesting Ascents\n\nDenali\n\nIn May, Zolo Demjan and Joseph Nezerka, of Czechoslovakia, climbed a new variation to the start of the Cassin Ridge. It starts just right of the Denali Diamond and joins the Cassin Ridge at the hanging glacier at approximately 14,000’.\n\nIn June, Americans Phil Powers, Tom Walters, and Greg Collins completed a new route on the Northwest Face. The route started at 9,000’ on the Peters Glacier and consisted of 7,000’ of mixed climbing to the 16,000’ level on the West Buttress.\n\nIn June, Americans Bob Gammelin and Lee James climbed a new variation on the upper South Buttress Route. Their route took a line up the remote east side of the mountain above Thayer Basin.\n\nOn June 5, Mugs Stump completed a spectacular solo ascent of the Cassin Ridge in an astounding 15 hours from the base of the Japanese couloir to the summit ridge. Starting from the 14,000’ basin on the West Buttress, Stump climbed up to the West Rib Route, skied and down climbed the Rib to the head of the Northeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier, climbed the Cassin Ridge, and descended the West Buttress back to the 14,000’ camp. Total round trip time was 27 hours, 30 minutes.\n\nOn June 21, 12 year old Taras Genet, son of the late McKinley guide Ray Genet, became the youngest person to reach the summit.\n\nMount Foraker\n\nIn June, Americans Jim Donini and Jack Tackle climbed a new variation to the Southeast Ridge, joining that route at approximately 13,000’. The 27-pitch route is named “Viper Ridge.”\n\nMount Huntington\n\nIn May, Americans Paul Teare and Jay Smith established a new route on the west face, right of the Harvard Route. It is named Phantom Wall, 5.9 A2.\n\nMount Dickey\n\nIn May, Italians Fablo Ledni, Coser Corrado, and Paolo Fanton climbed a new route on the south face. The “Italian Direct” has 40 pitches and is rated 5.10 A4.\n\nMount Barrille\n\nIn June, Jack Tackle and Jim Donini climbed a new route on the southeast face called “Cobra Pillar’.\n\nPeak 6800’ “Werewolf”, Ruth Gorge\n\nAustrians Andi Orgler and Angelica Stern established “Anemona Pillar”.\n\nAccidents/Incidents\n\nThe National Park Service conducted five major rescues on Mount McKinley in 1991, resulting in nine climbers being evacuated by helicopter. An additional nine incidents were reported to the mountaineering rangers. Of these, two climbers were evacuated by helicopter incidental to other rescue operations in progress. The remainder of these climbers were able to conduct their own self rescues without assistance from the park service.\n\nFor the first time since 1982 there were no mountaineering related fatalities in the park. Following are the more significant accidents and incidents that occurred in 1991.\n\nAvalanche; Multiple Injuries; Self Rescue\n\nOn April 25, 1991 Klass Wierenga, Frank De Vos, Frank Kleinbekman, and Matthijs Wiggers of the Dutch Mount Foraker Expedition, were climbing near the 8,000’ level on the 1974 Variation of the Southeast Ridge of Mount Foraker. At a point just a few feet below the crest of the ridge, the group triggered a large slab avalanche with a five foot crown and running approximately 1,600’. All four climbers were swept to the base of the ridge. Kleinbekman and Wiggers received minor injuries, and were able to dig out Wierenga, who was unconscious and suffered a pneumothorax. De Vos was semi-conscious, suffering a pneumothorax, dislocated shoulder, and fractured humerus. The climbers were unable to raise help with their radio, and began a self evacuation to the landing strip on the West Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier. On April 28, they were able to contact their air taxi pilot, and were flown out to Talkeetna.\n\nFalls with injuries; Frostbite; Acute Mountain Sickness; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn 5-14-91, four members of the Korean Blue Fire Expedition left their high camp at 18,200’ at Denali Pass on the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley, en route to the summit. Due to fatigue, AMS, and poor weather conditions, the climbers became separated on their descent. Il Soon Go, Jong Ho Ann, and Beom Kyou Lee bivouacked in the open on the night of 5-14-91. On 5-15-91, the frostbitten Ann fell 100’ while descending to camp, sustaining a minor head injury. Go sustained frostbitten hands while descending to camp. Meanwhile, Lee and Jun Chan Park, who had been waiting at Denali Pass, fell approximately 500’ while attempting to descend to the 17,200’ camp to obtain food and assistance. Park sustained a fractured thoracic vertebrae and Lee a cervical strain. On 5-16-91, mountaineering rangers and the NPS Lama helicopter evacuated Ann and Go from Denali Pass, and Lee and Park from 17,200’.\n\nHAPE; HACE; Frostbite; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn May 22, 1991 Korean Kim Hongbim, who was camped at Denali Pass at 18,200’ on the West Buttress Route on Mount McKinley, became seriously ill with severe AMS and high altitude pulmonary edema. Hongbim was lowered to the 17,200’ camp by other climbers high on the mountain. On May 23, 1991 Hongbim was lowered down the Rescue Gully to 14,200’ by the pararescue team of the 210th Air National Guard, assisted by rangers and other climbers at the 14,200’ camp. On May 24, Hongbim was airlifted from 14,200’ by an Air National Guard Pavehawk helicopter. He suffered from severe frostbite to both hands and pneumonia complicated by high altitude pulmonary edema. In a related incident on May 23, Geo Bong Kim, of the Korean Mokpo University Expedition, became seriously ill with high altitude cerebral edema while camped at 17,200’ on the West Buttress. Kim was lowered down the Rescue Gully to 14,200’ by members of his own expedition. On May 25, Kim’s condition remained critical and a ground evacuation was determined not feasible. He was airlifted from 14,200’ by the NPS Lama helicopter.\n\nCrevasse Fall; Multiple Injuries; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nOn May 29, 1991, New Zealander Tara Wingfield of the “Taking The Dog For a Walk” expedition was ascending from Windy Corner to the 14,200’camp on the West Buttress Route on Mount McKinley. While crossing a heavily crevassed area near 13,400’, a large snowbridge collapsed, and Wingfield fell approximately seven feet before her fall was arrested by the other members of her rope team. Wingfield was immediately hoisted from the crevasse. She sustained a dislocated patella, knee sprain, and fractured ribs. With assistance, Wingfield was able to continue to the 14,200’ camp. On May 31, Wingfield was airlifted from 14,200’ by the NPS Lama helicopter, after it was determined that a safe ground evacuation was not feasible by the remaining members of her expedition.\n\nAMS; Search; Self Rescue\n\nOn June 21, 1991, Japanese climbers Hiroshi Sakurai and Hiroshi Urayama arrived at 15,500’ on the Haston-Scott route on the south face of Mount McKinley. The pair had ascended 3,500’ from the bottom of the face that day. Urayama was struck with severe Acute Mountain Sickness and felt he should be rescued. That evening, the pair began calling “May Day” on their CB radio. The NPS responded with a search plane attempting to locate the “May Day” calls. Numerous contacts were made with many climbers including the Japanese, but due to a communication barrier, the two remained unidentified. “May Day” calls were again reported on June 22, and the NPS Lama helicopter began to search. Again the two Japanese were not identified. Urayama decided that he wasn’t going to be rescued, so the pair began ascending the route very rapidly, summiting early the next morning. They then descended and reported to the NPS ranger camp at 14,200’ that they were the ones calling “May Day’. With this information the search was called off.\n\nOpen Bivouacs; Frostbite; Helicopter Evacuation\n\nLate on July 3, 1991, Polish climber Krzysztof Wiecha began climbing alone to the summit of Mount McKinley from the 17,200’ camp on the West Buttress route. As Wiecha approached the summit from the 19,500’ area, the weather rapidly deteriorated with clouds, snow, high winds, and visibility near zero. Wiecha became disoriented, and by early on July 4 decided to seek shelter in a small snow cave that he dug near 20,000’. He carried no bivouac or survival gear. At 7:00 am, Wiecha was reported as overdue to NPS mountaineering rangers. The weather remained extremely poor on July 4th and 5th, with heavy snowfall, high winds, and high avalanche hazard prohibiting any air and ground search attempts. Meanwhile, Wiecha wandered around near the summit, attempting to find the descent route, taking shelter in several different locations. He began to suffer severely from the cold, altitude, dehydration, and exhaustion. By midday on July 6, the weather began to clear, and an air search was begun. Miraculously, Wiecha was spotted crawling from a crevasse just below the summit at approximately 19,800’.The NPS Lama helicopter was dispatched from Talkeetna, and two mountaineering rangers were flown to the “Football Field” at 19,500’. Rangers climbed to Wiecha, who was coherent but could barely move due to exhaustion and severely frostbitten feet. He was lowered approximately 900’ to the Football Field, where the Lama helicopter once again landed, and flew Wiecha off the mountain early on July 7. Both of Wiecha’s severely frostbitten feet were amputated.\n\nThere were a number of other incidents of altitude illness and frostbite this season. Many were treated at the NPS first-aid rescue camp at 14,200’ on the West Buttress.\n\nTrends and Items of Special Concern\n\nHeavy use: Near record numbers of climbers attempted to climb Mount McKinley this year. Climbers spent more than 17,000 user days on Mount McKinley alone. Over 12,000 of these were on the West Buttress. The use on the West Buttress is even higher when considering that many other routes are accessed via the West Buttress, plus many climbers that acclimate on that route as well.\n\nRescues: Ten of the eleven climbers (91%) that were rescued by helicopter this year were foreigners. 1.2% of climbers attempting Mount McKinley this year required rescue. Sanitation: With the heavy use, it is more important than ever for mountaineers to properly dispose of human feces and urine. Many camps, especially at higher elevations, are littered with feces and frozen urine spots that are not covered with the annual accumulation of snow. Not only is this an environmental degradation of the mountain, but there is risk of contamination of snow that might be melted and used as drinking water by future expeditions. We are still suggesting the use of plastic bags for latrines, which should be disposed of in a deep crevasse. The Park Service maintains pit latrines dug deeply into the snowpack, at base came on the Kahiltna Glacier, 14,000’ on the West Buttress, and at the landing area in the Ruth Amphitheater.\n\nTrash: Many expeditions are hauling their trash to base camp where it is flown off the mountain. Still others continue to dump their trash in crevasses. Trash accumulation on other popular mountains of the world continues to receive considerable publicity. Trash dumps and appalling sanitation conditions at the more popular campsites in the Himalayas, Europe, South America and elsewhere threaten human health, degrade the mountaineering experience, and threaten the mountain environment. Mountaineers of all nationalities must take the responsibility for, and the initiative in, preserving the quality of the world’s mountain environments. A combination of education, leading by example, and peer pressure are probably the most effective tools that can be brought to bear against less considerate mountaineers.\n\nCitations were issued for unauthorized guiding, littering, and improper disposal of human body waste.\n\nAdministrative notes for 1991:\n\nStaff consisted of:\n\nSouth District Ranger: Bob Seibert\n\nMountaineering Rangers: Renny Jackson, Ron Johnson, Daryl Miller, Jim Phillips and Roger Robinson\n\nStudent Conservation Inter: Steve Stotter\n\nAdministrative Clerk: Kathy Sullivan\n\nHelicopter Manager: Scott Beattie\n\nA portable radio repeater was again installed in the Ramparts west of the lower Kahiltna Glacier. This repeater helps to improve communications between the Talkeetna Ranger Station and the mountaineering patrols.\n\nThe newly constructed NPS building in Talkeetna was occupied this year. It serves as seasonal quarters, year round office for the South District Ranger, and search and rescue coordination center.\n\nA Development Concept Plan is in progress for the south side of Denali National Park. The planning process will address what level of development, or lack thereof, is appropriate for the area between Cantwell and the Southwest Preserve. The process will primarily deal with that portion of the Denali Park resource which is more readily accessible to, or able to, accommodate hiking. It will not address mountaineering activities on Mount McKinley and other major peaks of the Alaska Range within the National Park. The planning process will also address interpretive and access opportunities along the Parks Highway and the potential for a major visitor center somewhere on the south side of the range.\n\nAnnual Report: 1992\n\nThe 1992 climbing season on Mount McKinley was record-setting in the numbers of climbers and mountaineering fatalities. This year marked the most intense period of rescue in the mountain's history. Twenty-two rescue or recovery missions involving 28 climbers were conducted by the Talkeetna Ranger Staff and volunteers. Rescue costs incurred by the National Park Service for Mount McKinley totaled $206,000. This cost doubled the NPS SAR expenditures of 1991. The military costs associated with the rescues was $225,345. This brings the total for SAR costs to $431,345. The rescues this year attracted unprecedented attention by international media. South District Ranger and Incident Commander J.D. Swed was featured in interviews and appearances for radio, television, and newspaper and magazine articles describing the heroic efforts of the rescuers and the tragedy of the injured and dead.\n\nTogether, the NPS and the Korean Alpine Federation (KAF) joined in an effort to reduce the high percentage of South Koreans involved in rescues which have occurred over the last two years. This resulted in a 9 day November visit to Seoul, Korea by District Ranger J.D. Swed. Swed met with members of alpine and climbing clubs, search and rescue groups, and climbing school directors. He gave programs on the severity of the McKinley environment, difficulty of the assent, and statistics involving Korean mountaineers. Swed stated that the KAF is dedicated to educating Korean climbers who wish to attempt McKinley. A long range plan to improve communication, education and to exchange climbers was proposed.\n\nThe National Weather Service accurately predicated a storm in early May which was described as the \"worst storm to hit the mountain in 10 years\". This storm brought in excess of 60 inches of snow at the 7,200' base camp in a 24 hour period, and winds over 110 mph at 14,000! This adverse weather halted most summit attempts for several weeks and brought about a number of rescues. Both guides and climbers assisted the mountaineering rangers at the 14,200' Ranger station during these rescues, which were carried out throughout intense weather conditions. In a 10-day period from the start of the storm seven people died and six were rescued.\n\nThis was the second year the Aerospatile Lama helicopter was used in rescues on Mount McKinley. Piloted by Bill Ramsey for the second year, it was successful in a bold rescue of three Koreans at 17,700' on the Cassin Ridge. For the first time, short haul technique was used for rescues on the mountain when two American climbers at 11,000' on the East Buttress were extracted. The helicopter is credited for six irrefutable life saves and another six near-death saves this season.\n\nThe U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters were used in establishment and removal of the 14,200' ranger station. The 210th Air National Guard and Chinooks from Fort Wainwright assisted in rescue support.\n\nThe National Park Service revoked the concession permit of Genet Expeditions, Inc. by letter dated January 29, 1992. This revocation was based on four years of marginal or unsatisfactory performance evaluations during a five year period for unsafe practices. The owner of Genet Expeditions, Inc. appealed the decision. After several judicial proceedings, an out-of-court agreement was made and the Genet concession was reinstated. The expiration date of the Genet permit is 12-31-92. A prospectus for filling of this opportunity was announced to the public in December 1992. A concessioner will be selected prior to the climbing season commencing.\n\nThe 11,070' Mount Spurr, located 100 miles southwest of Mount McKinley in the western Alaska Range, erupted June 27th, causing glacier landings temporarily to be halted at the 7,200' basecamp on Mount McKinley. Expeditions that were beginning their climb were informed of the possibility of walking out if the ash continued to fall on the glaciers prohibiting landings.\n\nOn September 25, 1992, the town of Talkeetna dedicated a memorial to all climbers who lost their lives on Mount McKinley and other peaks in the Alaska Range. The memorial, which depicts two climbers making their way up a white pole that signifies Mount McKinley's snow covered slopes, is located in the Talkeetna cemetery.\n\nIn the winter of 1991, data was collected from an automatic meteorological censor device placed near 19,000' above Denali Pass by the Japanese Alpine Club. This instrument, which monitor's winds and temperature on Mount McKinley, recorded a low of -72.4 F on February 6, 1991. Beginning in November 1990, through February 1991, the temperature remained -60 F or colder for a total of 30 days. The wind monitoring instrument was destroyed by high winds and that data was lost.\n\nThe National Park Service conducted four 24-day patrols on Mount McKinley and numerous backcountry and hunting patrols in the Denali National Park and Preserve. We continue to staff a ranger station in Talkeetna where climbers are required to register for their expeditions.\n\nRegistration is required for all climbs and expeditions on Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker. Commencing in 1994 all climbers will be required to preregister by February 15th of the year they plan to climb. This is to allow the NPS to better plan for the staffing of the mountain patrols and in reviewing registration forms in response to the increasing number of climbers. Climbers and backpackers planning trips into other areas in the South District of Denali National Park and Preserve are encouraged to register. A strong emphasis is set on the ethics of maintaining self-sufficiency and to conduct self evacuations whenever possible. Using environmentally sound and accepted sanitation procedures is a high priority in maintaining the pristine wilderness of Denali National Park and Preserve.\n\nAll statistics in this document are for portions of the Alaska Range within the boundaries of Denali National Park and Preserve. Unless specifically noted, statistics apply only for Mount McKinley.\n\nStatistics and Interesting Ascents\n\nDenali\n\nIn 1992, 1,070 climbers, forming 291 expeditions, from 23 countries attempted to climb 10 different routes on Mount McKinley. This is 133 more climbers than 1991, and the most to date, with a total of 19,028 user days.\n\n831 (77%) of all climbers on McKinley attempted the West Buttress. This route by far remains the most popular and the most impacted environmentally.\n\nAmericans made up the largest segment of the climbers, with 634 climbers (59 percent). A total of 269 Americans reached the summit.\n\nThe rest of the countries represented on Mount McKinley this year were: Switzerland (68), United Kingdom (58), Germany (56), Japan (44), Korea (40), Canada, (37), France (24), Italy (18), Austria (17), Australia, (16), Norway (9), Mexico (8), Netherlands (8), Spain (6), Taiwan (6), Sweden (5), Scotland (4), China (4), USSR (3), Finland (2), Yugoslavia (2), and Argentina (1).\n\nNew Routes\n\nFive new routes were reported this year in the Alaska Range.\n\nThe \"BMTS O.B.\" team of Korea climbed a new route on the South Face of McKinley in June between the \"American Direct\" and the \"Japanese Direct\".\n\nThe \"CAC\" (Corean Alpine Club) pioneered a new route on the East Buttress of Kichatna Spire.\n\nClay Wadman and Bruce Miller climbed a direct line to the Colton-Leach route on the West Face of Mount Huntington.\n\nRandy Waitman, Clarice Dickess, Ian McRae, and Michelle Morseth climbed the West Ridge of Mount Brooks. The route took 3 days with the team summating on August 20, 1992. They descended the North ridge.\n\nJack Tackle and Bruce Normad climbed a New line on the West Buttress \"Direct\" June 11, 1992. The route is located just North West of Windy Corner. Twenty pitches of water ice, with mixed climbing high on the route.\n\nAccidents/Incidents\n\nFrostbite on fingers, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 6, the NPS mountaineering patrol rope team of mountaineering ranger Ron Johnson and SCA Keith Nicholson climbed from 11,000' to the 14,200' camp on the West Buttress of Mount McKinley. The temperature was minus 15 F and the wind speeds were estimated at 30 mph plus. Nicholson was wearing polypropylene glove liners and shell mittens. Just prior to arriving at the 14,200' camp Nicholson realized he had frostbite on his left thumb. A more thorough inspection was done at camp. Nicholson contracted frostbite on his little finger and thumb on his left hand and on all four finger tips of the right hand. A full recovery with no tissue damage has occurred.\n\nFrostbite, AMS, HAPE, HACE, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn April 25, climbers Daryl Hinman, Robert Rockwell, and Tom Roseman attempted to climb Mount McKinley via the Muldrow Glacier route. Due to cold weather, altitude, high winds, fatigue, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, frostbite and loss of supplies they become incapacitated at 17,500' below Denali Pass on the West Buttress side of the mountain. On May 10, 1992, Daryl Hinman climbed down to the 14,200' Ranger Station to get help. The NPS Lama helicopter, piloted by Bill Ramsey picked up Ranger Johnson and VIP Julie Culberson and flew up to 17,200'. There, Johnson and Culberson loaded Tom Roseman and Robert Rockwell into the Lama. Both expedition members were stricken by frostbite while Roseman suffered from pulmonary and cerebral edema. Both climbers were transferred to a fixed wing and flown to Anchorage.\n\nFall on headwall, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 10, the rope team of Paul Kogelmann and Timothy Hagan, fell approximately 500' down the headwall from 15,800'. Ranger Johnson and Culberson in the Lama then landed at the 15,200' level, and loaded Hagan into the ship and flew to the 14,200' ranger station to off load Johnson and Culberson and pick up Roseman, and Rockwell. The Lama then flew to the 7200' base camp transporting Roseman, Rockwell, and Hagan to a fixed wing aircraft that flew them to Anchorage.\n\nAbandonment by fellow climbers, rescue by NPS ground team\n\nOn May 10, the expedition of Edwige Sement, Frederick Sement, and Philippe Berthois spent the night at 17,200' without a stove. A stove had been cached at 16,200' on the West Buttress. On the afternoon of May 11, F. Sement and Berthois attempted to descend to 16,200' to retrieve the stove but turned back due to high winds and poor visibility. They decided to descend to 14,200' via the Rescue Gully, and return to 17,200' that evening with a stove. Because Ms. Sement felt she was too tired to descend, a decision was made to leave her at 17,000'. There were no other parties at 17,200'. Sement and Berthois arrived at 14,200' notified ranger Ron Johnson that they were too tired to climb back up to 17,200' and that Ms. Sement did not have a stove. A weather forecast received that morning predicted that a severe storm would hit Mount McKinley later that evening. Given the weather forecast, Johnson decided a rescue attempt was justified. Weather conditions at 14,200' consisted of blowing snow and winds gusting up to 30 mph. Johnson, NPS VIP Matt Culberson, along with volunteers Mike Wood and Willy Peabody left 14,200'. The rescue team ascended the Rescue Gully and arrived at 17,200'. Ms. Sement was found in her tent in good condition. The rescue team with Ms. Sement descended back to 14,200'. This expedition was issued a citation for Creating a Hazardous Condition which precipitated from decisions they made which were inappropriate and exposed rescuers to life threatening hazards. This expedition also reimbursed the NPS for rescue costs.\n\nFall on Cassin Ridge, fatalities, body recovery by helicopter\n\nOn May 10, Giovanni Calcagno and Roberto Piombe arrived at the base of the Cassin Ridge. The two Italians stated that they intended to climb and descend the Cassin Ridge in two or three days. On May 15, the NPS Ranger Station at 14,200' received a report that a body was observed at the base of the South Face the previous day. It was recognized that the body was that of an Italian climber whom he had met 10 days before. On May 16, mountaineering rangers Jim Phillips and Daryl R. Miller flew in the Lama to the South Face. Phillips and Miller recovered the remains of Roberto Piombe. The body was sling loaded to 7,200' and then flown out by fixed wing to Talkeetna. Giovanni Calcagno was located at approximately 15,400' on the first rock band on the Cassin Ridge just off route. Calcagno's body was not recovered.\n\nFall on South Face, with aircraft evacuation\n\nOn May 11, two Korean climbers, Song and Seung Hwan Lee were descending a new route they had climbed on the south face of Mount McKinley. Due to bad weather, the pair had decided to descend to their base camp and wait. At approximately 1720, while rappelling, Seog Woo Song fell 1000' to the bottom of the South face, on the East fork of the Kahilitna Glacier. Lee witnessed Song falling past him. Indications were that the rope broke during rappell. He was found unconscious with a head injury. Another Korean party assisted in bringing Song to the 7200' base camp. Song remained semi-unconscious and suffered with facial wounds, dilated left pupil, right pupil slightly reactive, moveable extremities and difficult respirations. The Alaska Air National Guard (210th), hampered by poor weather, arrived at the 7,200' base camp on May 13, and evacuated Song to Anchorage. Song remained hospitalized for three weeks where he slowly regained consciousness.\n\nFrostbite, AMS on the Cassin Ridge, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn April 28, a three-member Korean expedition flew in to climb the Cassin Ridge. They started with 15 days of food. By May 9 they had reached their high camp at 17,700'. Their plans were to make a summit attempt the next day, but strong winds were encountered forcing the three to construct a snow cave. While working on the snow cave, their tent blew away along with most of their fuel, food, clothing and climbing equipment. The three climbers rationed food and fuel in order to wait out the weather. For over a week they rationed themselves to one cup of rice and one quart of water a day. The weather finally improved but they were too weak to continue in the cold windy conditions. The leader Hyun Doo Kang had frost-bite on four fingers. They began distress calls and information that they had no food, no fuel and the leader had AMS along with frostbite. They were too weak to go up or down. Weather remained poor and it was not until 1400 on May 17, that the NPS Lama arrived at 7,200' base camp. The Lama attempted to deliver an air drop of fuel and food at 17,700' on the Cassin Ridge. The Lama experienced extreme down drafts and forced the helicopter to land back at the 7,200' base camp. When the winds subsided, the Lama departed with ranger Jim Phillips aboard. The Lama landed and picked up one Korean and flew to the 14,200' camp and dropped him off, returning to pick up another climber, one at a time. An Army Chinook delivered them to 7200' base camp and a Pavehawk flew them to Anchorage. Kang suffered frostbite on all fingers and three toes. The other members, Jun and Kim, received minor frost bite on several of their toes.\n\nCrevasse fall, aircraft evacuation\n\nOn May 17, three Korean climbers Duk Sang Jang, Seong Yu Kang, and Dong Choon Seo from the Je Ju University expedition were preparing a campsite during whiteout conditions at approximately 15,000' on the West Buttress. Their campsite was located on a snowbridge over a crevasse. The snowbridge collapsed and Kang and Seo fell 60' into the crevasse. Jang was uninjured and able to descend to 14,200' and notify Mountaineering Ranger Ron Johnson. A decision was made to send NPS VIP's Matt and Julie Culberson and volunteers Jim Wickwire and John Roskelly to the site. Route finding was difficult due to blowing snow and low visibility. The rescue party found that the collapsed snowbridge had exposed a part of a crevasse that was 40' wide and 200' long, and about 60' deep. Kang was observed in the bottom of the crevasse, buried to his chest with debris. Culberson and Roskelly rappelled into the crevasse and dug Kang out of the debris. Culberson and Roskelly also located Seo. Brian Okonek and Bruce Blatchley arrived at the rescue site with a sked litter. Seo was worked free of the debris and was extricated from the crevasse. He was conscious and hypothermic with suspected internal injuries, injuries to his lumbar spine and pelvis, and self inflicted lacerations to his tongue. Seo was then lowered to 14,200'. Kang was uninjured. On May 18, a break in the weather allowed Seo to be flown to 7,200' base camp aboard the Lama. Seo was transferred to a 210th Air National Guard Pavehawk helicopter and flown to Anchorage.\n\nHACE/HAPE fatality at the 14,200 camp\n\nOn May 17, a Swiss expedition was camped at 14,200' on the West Buttress of Mount Mckinley. The expedition leader Roli Merz notified mountaineering ranger Ron Johnson that a team member was having difficulty breathing. Johnson and Matt Culberson were led to Alex Von Bergen's tent. Von Bergen appeared cyanotic and his pupils were fixed and dilated. Johnson notified Dr. Mike Young who arrived at the scene. CPR was initiated by Matt and Julie Culberson after a pulse was not detected. Von Bergen remained pulse-less and unresponsive and was pronounced dead. The body was removed from the 14,200' station by the Lama and a fixed wing. The body was flown to Talkeetna. An autopsy was performed at the Alaska State Crime Laboratory. The results determined Von Bergen died from pulmonary and cerebral edema.\n\nFall on Orient Express, three fatalities, bodies recovered by helicopter\n\nAt approximately mid-day on May 20, Soo Yang Yung, Sung Tak Hong, and Seong Jong Jin from the Je-Ju University Expedition were killed while attempting to descend the Orient Express route on McKinley. They had started their ascent on the West Rib and in the course of 10 days made their ascent up to the 14,000' level. From May 14th, through May 16th they encountered strong winds which kept them tent bound. The weather improved on the 17th, and the three Koreans ascended to 16,200'. On May 20, 1992, Matt and Julie Culberson discovered the bodies of Yung, Hong and Jin at the 15,800' level of the Orient Express. The bodies were recovered by the NPS helicopter.\n\nCrevasse fall, fatality, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 4, Terrance \"Mugs\" Stump, a mountain guide for Mountain Trip, and his clients Nelson Max and Robert Hoffman began climbing the Japanese Ramp route on the South Buttress. On May 20, Stump and Max reached the summit via the Southeast Spur in extremely adverse weather conditions. Max suffered frostbite to his feet on the descent. On May 21, Mugs and his clients began descent from the high camp at 16,000' on the Ramp. First on the rope team was Hoffman, followed by Max who was tied in a short distance behind and Stump at the end. The group approached a large crevasse. Hoffman stopped near the edge of this crevasse, unsure how to proceed. Stump approached the crevasse from the uphill, passing by Max and Hoffman. He was standing on the uphill lip of the crevasse when they heard a \"crack\", and Stump suddenly disappeared into the crevasse. Stump fell, pulling on approximately 15' of slack rope between him and Max. Max attempted to self-arrest, and was pulled towards the crevasse for approximately 20' before stopping. The rope between him and Stump became slack. Feeling in a very precarious position on the uphill side of the crevasse, Max cut the rope and tied it to a ski pole. They traversed around and approached the accident site from below. Max rappelled into the crevasse but was unable to locate Stump. He described the debris as a large volume of very hard blocks of dense snow and blue ice. The crevasse was at least 60' deeper from the bottom of the large blocks of ice wedged into it. There was no sign of Stump. Because of the perceived danger, their condition, the weather, and low probability of survival, Max and Hoffman decided to abandon their efforts to recover Stump. On May 22, another expedition heard distress calls from Max and Hoffman and assisted them in getting a message to NPS. Hoffman and Max suffered frostbite and were assisted to 11,400'. The Lama transported Max and Hoffman to 7,200'. They were flown to Anchorage by fixed wing aircraft. The Lama returned to the accident site with NPS rangers aboard. A large volume of debris with big chunks of snow and blue ice was wedged into the crevasse as Hoffman and Max described. Due to the fact the incident occurred more than 25 hours earlier, and the exposure of rescuers to excessive hazards, a recovery effort was not initiated. Max was admitted to the Humana Hospital with frostbite on both feet.\n\nFall above Denali Pass, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 28, the German team of Gerhard Seibert and Christoph Mach ascended the upper West Rib. They decided not to make a summit attempt and traverse down the West Buttress route. As they descended to Denali Pass, Mach led the rope team when Seibert fell. Seibert suffered head lacerations from the fall and remained unconscious. Mach set up a tent and began calling for help on their CB. On May 29th, Ranger Daryl R. Miller mounted a ground rescue consisting of Billy Shott, Mike Abbott, and Dr. Collin Grisson, all VIP's working on the NPS Mountaineering patrol. The rescue team left 14,200' and reached the 17,200' camp. VIP Andy Lapkass joined the team at 17,200'. The rescue party reached Mach and Seibert 19,400' and found Seibert to have regained conscious. Mach suffered frostbite on his left hand and Seibert was experiencing double-vision. The rescue team began lowering the two climbers and reached the 17,200'. The Lama landed and transported both injured climbers to 7,200' and a 210th Air National Guard Pavehawk flew them to Anchorage.\n\nFall on the Messner, four fatalities, body recovery by helicopter\n\nOn May 31, four Canadians fell approximately 3,000' to their deaths from 19,300' on the Messner Couloir. The team departed the 17,200' camp on the West Buttress on May 30. The group was not seen again until that evening as they descended the summit ridge at 20,000'. The weather at 17,200' was deteriorating with winds gusting up to 60 MPH. 7,200' base camp was notified by another expedition that the Canadians had not returned to 17,200'. The weather cleared and a search plane with ranger Roger Robinson aboard left for the search area. Robinson saw four climbers traversing between 19,200' and 19,300' on the Messner Couloir. Robinson notified Ranger Daryl Miller at 14,200' Ranger Station. Ranger Miller was able to observe the group with the use of binoculars. Minutes later the climber in the back of the rope team fell, dragging the rest of the members down some 3,000' over the rock bands and through the hourglass of the couloir. They stopped above an icefall at approximately 15,800'. Ranger Miller, along with NPS VIP's Collin Grisson, Billy Shott, and Mike Abbott departed for the accident site. The visibility at 15,000' was 25'. The snow conditions were extremely unstable with the slope settling and the glacier cracking beneath. The patrol unanimously concurred that it was unsafe to continue the search given the conditions. On June 1 the viability had improved. The rescue team departed and reached the accident site. Three bodies were found at 15,800' with a fourth 200' higher. The bodies were identified as the Canadian team. The slope was still unstable and a body recovery with the ground team was not possible. The NPS Lama recovered the bodies using a grappling hook. The bodies were flown to 7,200' base camp and flown by fixed wing to Talkeetna.\n\nAvalanche on East buttress, short haul by helicopter\n\nOn June 6 the team of Bob Archbold and Allen Sanderson, left their 11,000' camp climbing up the East Buttress of Mount McKinley. They made a decision to descend because Archbold was not comfortable with the route. While descending the route, they heard and saw an icefall avalanche start at approximately 13,000' on their route. Sanderson and Archbold were hit by the avalanche. Sanderson, uninjured, observed the slack rope beneath him reaching into the crevasse. The slide was estimated to be 100 meters wide with debris running 200 meters further down the slope. Archbold was carried down slope some 150' and 60' down into a crevasse. Archbold was wedged into the crevasse but managed to free himself and his pack. He was then able to jumar out of the crevasse. He had sustained a significant head wound and was complaining of lower leg pain. They descended to their 11,000' camp. Sanderson was able to contact a pilot, with a CB radio. The NPS responded in the Lama and performed the first short haul extrication. Using screamer suits, Sanderson and Archbold were short hauled to a staging area on the Ruth Glacier. The actual short haul operation was less than three minutes, from 11000' on the East Buttress to the Mountain House on the Ruth Glacier. Both climbers were flown to a Anchorage hospital.\n\nAvalanche on Mount Foraker, two fatalities, one self-evacuation\n\nOn the morning of June 14, Tom Walter, Ritt Kellogg, and Colby Coombs skied to the base of the Pink Panther Route, on Mount Foraker and started their ascent. On June 18, the weather was poor with additional snow accumulation. Early in the evening of the 18th, the weather cleared and the climbers began climbing the final rock buttress which marks the last third of the route. The weather remained good until the final 300 ', when it deteriorated with wind and poor visibility. They continued to climb up the final 50 to 60 degree snow and ice slope above the rock buttress. At this time Walter was leading the rope team with Coombs in the Middle and Kellogg at the end. They were climbing simultaneously when they were hit with an avalanche. As Coombs was hit from snow above, he began to self-arrest with his ice axe. He was pushed downhill by the avalanche debris for approximately 20' before being flipped over backwards and tumbling out of control. Coombs was knocked unconscious. Early in the morning of June 19, Coombs regained consciousness and found himself hanging by the climbing rope in the upper part of the rock buttress at approximately 12,300'. He was experiencing pain over his entire body, and hypothermia. Walter was hanging from a rope a short distance away and Coombs was able to climb over to him. There was no sign of life. Kellogg was hanging below upside down and also showed no signs of life. Coombs spent the day and night of June 19th resting. On the morning of the 20th, Coombs starting descending the Southeast Ridge. On June 25, he arrived at the 7,200' basecamp. Because of bad weather, Coombs remained at basecamp until June 28, and then was flown to the hospital in Anchorage. He was diagnosed with a fractured cervical vertebrae, fractured left ankle, and fractured left scapula.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness:\n\n105 cases (10%)of climbers reported symptoms of AMS:\n\n55 (52%) were mild\n\n40 (38%) were Moderate\n\n0 (9%) were severe\n\nFrostbite:\n\n38 cases (4%) reported some degree of frostbite:\n\n21 (55%) were mild\n\n11 (28%) required physician care\n\n6 (16%) required hospitalization\n\nHAPE:\n\n12 cases (1%) reported symptoms of HAPE\n\n9 were treated at the 14,200 ranger station with oxygen and advised to descend .\n\n3 required hospitalization\n\nHACE:\n\n4 cases (.3%) reported symptoms of HACE\n\n2 were treated on the mountain and advised to descend to a lower altitude\n\n2 required hospitalization\n\nAdministrative notes for 1992\n\nThe south District staff consisted of:\n\nSouth District Ranger: J.D. Swed\n\nMountaineering Rangers: Ron Johnson, Daryl R. Miller, Jim Phillips and Roger Robinson\n\nAdministrative Clerk: Kathy Sullivan\n\nHelicopter Manager: Scott Beattie\n\nHelicopter Pilot: Bill Ramsey\n\nStudent Conservation Aid: Keith Nickolson\n\nA special recognition must be made to VIP's who were on the Denali patrols with mountaineering Rangers. They had the task of dealing with the multitudinous rescues and body recoveries, in severe weather. Due to the number of search and rescue missions and the shortage of NPS personnel, we also used a number of climbers hired in emergency situations. We are forever indebted to the many guides and climbers that assisted in these rescue situations on Mount McKinley.\n\nVolunteers In the Park (VIP) on Denali patrols: Matt Culberson Randy Waitman Julie Culberson Rowan Laver Sheryl Gurtner Rupert Wedgewood Billy Shott Leslie Reid Jeff Brink Collin Grisson Jeff Moss Mike Abbott\n\nA portable radio repeater was once again installed in the Ramparts west of the lower Kahilitna Glacier. This repeater was an integral part in communications between the Talkeetna Ranger Station and the mountaineering patrols.\n\n-- Daryl Miller, J.D. Swed\n\nAnnual Report: 1993\n\nThe 1993 climbing season was essentially normal compared to the tragic season last year. Weather was better than normal and climbers generally exhibited more caution contributing to the safer season. There was one fatality on Mt. McKinley and 13 other rescue missions within the mountains of the Park. This compares to the 13 fatalities last year (11 on Mt. McKinley and 2 on Mt. Foraker). This season's rescue costs totaled $70,800 compared to $206,000 for 1992.\n\nConsideration for new regulations including pre-registration are ongoing. At the present time, all climbers are required to register for Mt. McKinley and Mt. Foraker prior to their expedition.\n\nFour 24-day mountaineering patrols were rotated through the 14,200' Ranger Station from May 1st through the first week in July. The U.S. Army provided its CH-47 Chinook helicopters to establish and extract our mountain facilities. Alaska Air National Guard Rescue personnel assisted our first patrol. They also provided supplies and equipment for the 14,200' camp infrastructure.\n\nThe open concession left last year by Genet Expeditions has been filled by Alpine Ascents International. They will be conducting commercial operations on Mt. McKinley beginning in 1994.\n\nStatistics\n\nDenali\n\nA record number of 1108 climbers attempted Mt. McKinley with 670 (60%) reaching the summit this season.\n\nWith a superb weather season on the mountain, surprisingly only 17% attempted routes other than the West Buttress. The West Rib is the second busiest route with 92 climbers compared to 923 on the West Buttress.\n\nClimbers of thirty-one nationalities attempted the mountain. In total, 468 (42%)of the climbers were from outside the United States. The breakdown: USA (639), Germany (68), Switzerland (60), Japan (60), England (58), Canada (42), France (33), Spain (23), Austria (23), Norway (20), Italy (12), Australia (9), New Zealand (9), Czechoslovakia (6), Iceland (6), Korea (6), Netherlands (4), Sweden (4), Chili (3), India (3), Mexico (3), Nepal (3), Slovenia (3), Bulgaria (2), Ireland (2), Poland (2), Belgium (1), Columbia (1), Finland (1), Holland (1), Kazakstan (1).\n\nRescues & Medicals\n\nEleven of the fifteen climbers (73%) that were rescued by helicopter this year were foreigners. This year, 1.1% of the climbers attempting Mount McKinley this year required rescue.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness\n\n56 (5%) climbers reported symptoms of AMS. Of these:\n\n44 were mild or moderate symptoms\n\n12 were HAPE or HACE\n\nFrostbite\n\n19 (2%) climbers reported some degree of frostbite. Of these:\n\n13 were superficial\n\n6 were more severe and involved some degree of tissue loss\n\nNew Routes and Notable Ascents\n\nAmerican climbers Mike Pennings and Jeff Hollenbaugh made an ascent of a new route on Serenity Spire in the Kichatna Spires.\n\nAlso on Serenity Spire, Americans Doug Byerly and Calvin Hebert ascended a new route.\n\nMt. Thunder (10,970'), west of Mt Hunter's South Peak, received its first ascent by British climbers Geoff Hornby and David Barlow.\n\nAmericans Terry Kennedy and Pat Callis climbed a new route on the SW Face of Kahiltna Peaks East summit.\n\nThe most unusual and notable climb of the season was the ascent of the West Buttress route by a blind woman. This remarkable climb was achieved by American Joan Phelps, a 54-year-old woman, who was guided up the mountain by her twin sons, Marty and Michael.\n\nThe first ever 'big three summits' in one season was achieved by Americans Greg Collins and Gary Wilmot. They succeeded on the West Buttress of Mt. McKinley, the Southeast Ridge on Mt. Foraker, and the West Ridge of Mt. Hunter.\n\nAccidents & Incidents\n\nIn 1993 the National Park Service conducted thirteen major rescue missions on Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker, resulting in fifteen persons being evacuated by helicopter. There was one fatal accident.\n\nFrostbite; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn April 26, David Peel, 31, P.J. Edwards, 27, and James Gallager, 33, of an eight-member British Army expedition were climbing to the summit of Mount Foraker via the Archangel Ridge. During their ascent they encountered sub-zero temperatures and 55 mph winds, but continued to the summit despite being extremely cold, with Peel and Edwards sustaining moderate cases of frostbite. On April 27, Gallager sustained minor frostbite while at high camp. The three climbers abandoned their high camps and descended, joining the remaining five expedition members at their basecamp. On April 28, they decided that a rescue was needed, and the five uninjured climbers began a 50-mile trek to Wonder Lake to seek help. On May 3, 1993, Peel, Gallager, and Edwards made an emergency radio call to a passing military aircraft, requesting a rescue. Late on May 3, the NPS Lama helicopter evacuated the three frostbitten climbers from the Foraker Glacier.\n\nHAPE; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn May 18, Sgt. Michael Dunn, 31, of a U.S. Navy-Marine expedition became extremely ill with high altitude pulmonary edema at 14,200 feet on the West Buttress route. Dunn ascended at a fast rate, arriving at 14,200 feet on his fourth day on the mountain. Dunn was stabilized at the NPS camp. Due to Dunn's poor condition, the need for a rapid descent, and the risk of a ground evacuation, he was evacuated by the NPS Lama helicopter on May 19.\n\nAcute Dehydration; AMS; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn May 20, Sgt. Anthony Braithwaite, 29, of the U.S. Navy-Marine expedition collapsed from dehydration, exhaustion, and acute mountain sickness while climbing near Windy Corner at 13,300 feet on the West Buttress route. Braithwaite had been suffering from acute mountain sickness and severe diarrhea for at least the previous 48 hours, but his expedition continued to climb to higher elevations. A Mountain Trip guided expedition encountered Braithwaite shortly after he collapsed, finding him unconscious. They administered emergency medical care, began lowering Braithwaite to a helicopter landing zone, and called for a helicopter rescue. NPS volunteers arrived to assist. The NPS Lama helicopter evacuated Braithwaite from the Windy Corner area to Kahiltna basecamp. An Alaska Air National Guard Pavehawk helicopter transported Braithwaite from basecamp to Anchorage.\n\nFall With Injuries; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn May 25, American Don Cook, 62, was descending a steep section of ridge at approximately 16,700 feet on the West Buttress route. Cook and his team were in a weakened state from their summit climb the previous day. They were descending in poor weather, poor visibility, and unstable snow conditions. Cook lost his footing and fell when unstable snow broke away beneath his feet and he was unable to self arrest. He fell approximately 40 feet and stopped after hitting rocks, sustaining injuries to the chest. Cook was able to descend to the NPS camp at 14,200 feet. Cook was assessed by physicians who suspected rib fractures. Due to pain, the possibility of a further complicating chest injury, and patient age, Cook was evacuated to Kahiltna basecamp by the NPS Lama helicopter and flown by fixed wing airplane from the mountain.\n\nFatal Fall:\n\nOn May 30, American Charles Cearly, 40, was descending the Orient Express on the upper West Rib route. He was descending with his partners unroped, and was not using an ice axe, instead using only a ski pole. At approximately 19,200 feet the group stopped, deciding that they should begin climbing roped. As Cearly stopped, he lost his footing and began sliding. He was unable to stop himself without an ice axe, and fell approximately 3,000 feet to his death. Two NPS volunteers reached Cearly's body several hours later. A ranger was inserted into the scene using a helicopter short-haul and recovered the body. Cearly died from multiple traumatic injuries.\n\nHAPE; HACE; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 7, Austrian mountaineer Eder Ewald, 36, developed severe cases of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema and High Altitude Cerebral Edema while climbing the West Buttress route. Ewald descended to 14,200 feet from 16,200 feet on June 6 after becoming ill with acute mountain sickness, but his condition deteriorated to a life threatening state that night. He received emergency medical care from NPS rangers and volunteers at the NPS 14,200 camp on June 7. A helicopter evacuation was delayed until late in the day due to poor weather.\n\nHAPE; Hypothermia; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 6, Japanese climber Yamashita Sunao, 40, became sick and disoriented while attempting to climb to the summit of Mount McKinley via the West Buttress route. Sunao was able to descend to 14,200 feet with assistance from other climbers and an NPS mountaineering patrol on June 7. Sunao was diagnosed as suffering from High Altitude Pulmonary Edema and hypothermia, and was treated at the NPS camp at 14,200 feet. On June 7, Sunao was evacuated by the NPS Lama helicopter in conjunction with the evacuation of Austrian Eder Ewald.\n\nFrostbite; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 8, a German climber Juliane Manelshajen, 29, developed moderate frostbite on both her feet while attempting to climb to the summit of Mount McKinley on the West Buttress route. Despite being advised to descend and seek care for her injury, Manelshajen stayed at high camp at 17,200 feet while her climbing partners made another summit attempt. On June 10, Manelshajen was examined at the NPS 14,200- foot camp. Due to the extent of frostbite on both feet, and the potential for severe tissue damage if she attempted to descend under her own, Manelshajen was evacuated by the NPS Lama helicopter.\n\nHAPE; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 10, Japanese mountaineer Shojirou Tazawa, 47, became ill with High Altitude Pulmonary Edema while climbing the West Buttress route. Tazawa received medical care at the NPS camp at 14,200 feet and was stabilized. With assistance from NPS volunteers, Tazawa and his expedition members descended to the 11,200-foot camp where they hoped Tazawa would recover. On June 12 Tazawa's condition seriously deteriorated. NPS volunteers returned and found Tazawa to be in a serious life threatening condition, and called for an immediate air evacuation. The NPS Lama helicopter evacuated Tazawa from the 11,200-foot camp.\n\nMedical--Internal Bleeding; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 16, Japanese climber Akira Sakaguchi, 34, was evacuated from 14,200 feet on the West Buttress by the NPS Lama helicopter after he was field diagnosed with a possible life threatening gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nAMS; Pulmonary Embolism; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 15, Shyam Blon, 32, of Nepal began suffering from acute mountain sickness near the summit of Mount McKinley. Blon and his expedition were able to return to their high camp at 17,200 feet. On June 16, Blon began coughing up blood, and he descended immediately to the NPS camp at 14,200 feet where he was examined by a physician. He was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, and an immediate air evacuation was requested. Blon was evacuated by the NPS Lama helicopter.\n\nAvalanche; Multiple Injuries; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 16, Mexican Bertha Ramirez, 41, was hit by an avalanche while climbing in the lower couloir on the West Rib route on Mount McKinley. Ramirez was swept 100 feet to the bottom of the couloir and partially buried. Although unresponsive when dug out by her partners, they were able to revive her. Ramirez suffered from facial and upper extremity injuries. The team was able to contact an aircraft in the area, which notified the NPS Lama helicopter as it was en route to 14,200 feet to evacuate another climber (Blon). The Lama was able to land near the base of the couloir and evacuate Ramirez in conjunction with the other rescue in progress.\n\nHACE; Rescue; Helicopter Evacuation:\n\nOn June 27, Czech climber Lubomir Tesar, 33, was rescued from 17,200 feet on the West Buttress route. Tesar and his three climbing partners rapidly ascended to the 17,200-foot high camp in only six days where Tesar contracted High Altitude Pulmonary and Cerebral Edema. Tesar was lowered in a litter down the Rescue Gully by mountain guides from Mountain Trip, Tesar's partners, NPS volunteers, and a park ranger. Attempts to stabilize Tesar were undertaken for 16 hours at the NPS camp at 14,200 feet. Significant improvement was not shown so Tesar was air evacuated by the NPS Lama helicopter on June 28.\n\nThere were a number of other injuries, medical problems, and altitude related problems this season. Thirty-eight climbers were treated at the NPS first-aid/rescue camp at 14,200 feet on the West Buttress and the climbers were able to descend on their own without assistance from the Park Service. In other cases climbers were able to perform their own self-rescues without NPS assistance.\n\nUnauthorized Mountain Guides:\n\nSeveral unauthorized guides conducted illegal commercial activities on Mount McKinley this year. This is prohibited by the Code of Federal Regulations. The National Park Service investigated all suspected unauthorized guides. Two unauthorized guides were cited and convicted in Federal Magistrate's Court with fines totalling over $9100. These illegal trips seriously compromised client safety. One client became seriously ill with life threatening HAPE and HACE and would have died had he not been rescued by the park's helicopter. Another guide abandoned two clients and allowed them to wander around unroped in extremely hazardous terrain. They also suffered from frostbite.\n\nThere are seven companies that hold concession permits to guide on Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker. Prospective clients should be certain that they are employing one of the authorized concessionaires. Illegally guided trips could be denied access to the park. All suspected illegal guides will be investigated and law enforcement action may be taken.\n\nSanitation:\n\nWith increasing use by climbers, it is more important than ever for mountaineers to properly dispose of human feces and urine. Many camps, especially at higher elevations, are littered with feces and frozen urine spots that are not covered with the annual accumulation of snow. Not only is this an environmental degradation of the mountain, but there is risk of contamination of snow that might be melted and used as drinking water by future expeditions. We are still suggesting the use of plastic bags for latrines, which should be disposed of in a deep crevasse. The NPS maintains pit latrines dug deeply into the snowpack at base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier, 14,300 feet on the West Buttress, and at the landing area in the Ruth Amphitheater.\n\nAdditionally, we have recently experimented with the removal of human waste in barrels by helicopter. We are also planning for the use of an experimental latrine at high camp at 17,200 feet on the West Buttress.\n\nTrash:\n\nMost expeditions are hauling their trash to base camp where it is flown off the mountain. Still others continue to dump their trash in crevasses. Trash accumulation on other popular mountains of the world continues to receive considerable publicity. Trash dumps and appalling sanitation conditions at the more popular campsites in the Himalayas, Europe, South America and elsewhere threaten human health, degrade the mountaineering experience, threaten the mountain environment, and can threaten climbers' freedom of access to some mountain areas. Mountaineers of all nationalities must take the responsibility for, and the initiative in, preserving the quality of the world's mountain environments. A combination of education, leading by example, and peer pressure are probably the most effective tools that can be brought to bear against less considerate mountaineers.\n\nCitations were issued for littering, abandoning food and equipment caches, and improper disposal of human body waste in 1993.\n\nAdministrative notes for 1993:\n\nThe South District staff consisted of:\n\nSouth District Ranger: J.D. Swed\n\nMountaineering Rangers: Daryl Miller, Kevin Moore, Jim Phillips, and Roger Robinson\n\nAdministrative Clerk: Kathy Sullivan\n\nStudent Conservation Intern: Mike Loso\n\nHelicopter Crew: Dave Kreutzer (manager), Bill Ramsey and Jim Hood (pilots), and Scott Kimball (mechanic)\n\nThe Volunteer Program used to staff McKinley Patrols is crucial to the safety of climbers. These people unselfishly gave up their time and energy to assist mountaineers and save lives. The National Park Service would like to thank VIPs.\n\nVolunteers in the Park (VIP) on Denali patrols: Gary Sapp John Roskelley Mark Wilford Jeff Maus Steve Gorman Paul Reddington Colin Grissom Dalton Maples Mike Welch Vince Langman Keith Nicholson Allan Ellsworth Rupert Wedgewood Andrew Laurence\n\nA special thanks to McKinley guides that assisted with rescues.\n\n-- J.D. Swed\n\nAnnual Report: 1994\n\nFor the third consecutive year, a new record has been set for the number of mountaineers venturing up Mount McKinley. A multitude of 1,277 climbers attempted the mountain during the 1994 season with 575 (45%) successful mountaineers reaching the summit. This year was also a tragic reminder of the 1992 season relating to severe weather and the margin of safety above 14,000 feet. The month of May persisted with fierce weather conditions causing most of the accidents resulting in three deaths and many rescues on Mount McKinley. The climbing season concluded with a total of seven fatalities involving 20 separate rescues in Denali National Park & Preserve. These accidents consisted of climbing falls, cold injuries, and high altitude illnesses.\n\nIllegal guiding was again an issue in Denali National Park with the NPS taking legal action against numerous illegal guides. Two men attempting to illegally guide on Mount McKinley deserve special mention. One American guide was fined $500.00 and not permitted to enter an Alaska national park, without prior notice to rangers, for three years. A German guide was turned over to the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. He was arrested, spent the night in jail, and was later deported to Germany. Regardless of nationality, guides not employed by Denali National Park licensed concessions, and bringing clients to Mount McKinley or Mount Foraker, are breaking federal law when they do so. Rangers will continue to aggressively enforce guiding regulations.\n\nNew Regulations\n\nBeginning in 1995 climbers on Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker will be charged a mountaineering program fee of $150 per climber. This will offset mountaineering administrative costs such as prepositioning and maintaining the high altitude ranger station at 14,200 feet on the West Buttress route, mountaineering salaries, education materials directed at reducing the number of accidents, transportation, and supplies. Climbers for Mount McKinley and Mount Foraker will be required to register a minimum of 60 days in advance. By requiring advance registration, the Denali mountaineering staff can provide information to prospective mountaineers on hazards, and how to prepare, equip, and schedule their expedition. It also provides time to discuss requirements concerning resource issues such as littering and human waste disposal. Information packets containing new regulations, new registration forms, and fee payment procedures are available by contacting the Talkeetna Ranger Station.\n\nStatistics\n\nIn 1994, 1,277 climbers, assembling 303 expeditions, attempted seven different routes on Mount McKinley. This is a 15% increase in the total number of climbers over 1993. Forty-five per cent (570) of the mountaineers were international climbers from 21 countries. The United States had the most climbers at 707, England (74), Switzerland (58), Germany (51), Japan (51), Korea (50), Spain, (27), France (27).\n\nThe West Buttress route saw 1,067 climbers, consisting of 83% of all traffic. The West Rib had 68 climbers attempting the upper section from the 14,200-foot basin, with only 36 starting the complete route from the Northeast Fork of the Kahiltna Glacier. The Muldrow Glacier had 50 climbers attempting Mount McKinley from the north side of the park. Twenty-three climbers chose the South Buttress route. This was a significant increase compared to the past four years. There were 302 guided clients and 16 solo climbers. The longest expedition lasted 36 days. The average was around 18 days.\n\nRescue\n\nTwenty major search-and-rescue missions were conducted this year involving 31 climbers. Fourteen of the 31 climbers (45%) needing rescue were foreign. Overall, two per cent of the climbers attempting McKinley required rescue.\n\nMedical\n\nThe 14,200-foot ranger station, staffed with both Volunteers-in- the-Park (VIPs) and mountaineering rangers, treated approximately 45 climbers who were afflicted with frostbite, AMS, HAPE, and HACE.\n\nFrostbite: 30 climbers were treated for some degree of frostbite. Of these: 21 were superficial; 9 were more severe and involved some tissue loss.\n\nAcute Mountain Sickness (AMS): 93 climbers reported symptoms of AMS; 66 were mild or moderate cases; 27 were afflicted by High Altitude Pulmonary or Cerebral Edema.\n\nSafety\n\nMountaineering rangers, guides, and climbers are increasingly concerned about the impact of over one thousand climbers annually using the West Buttress route. The impact of human waste and trash is significant to health and safety. A great safety concern is the fact that over 90 climbers at one time were ascending on the Headwall fixed lines above 14,000 feet. Overcrowding is also a serious issue at the 16,200-feet camp, which often commits unacclimatized groups to ascend to the higher camp.\n\nNew Routes and Interesting Ascents\n\nThe Kichatna Spires had four new routes climbed and one first ascent.\n\nOn July 1 Mt. Jeffers (8,000 feet) had a new route climbed via the West Face by Jonathan Allen & Douglas Hall.\n\nOn July 1 Jay Smith and Steve Gerberding climbed a new route on the West Face of Mt. Jeffers.\n\nOn July 8 Flattop Peak (8,400 feet) had a new route on the Southeast Buttress climbed by Michael Pennings and Douglas Hall.\n\nOn July 16 Mt. Nevermore had a new route climbed via the Northwest Face by Douglas Hall and Douglas Byerly.\n\nOn July 8 Stalagmite Spire, (first spire South of Flattop) had a first ascent by Jonathan Allen and Doug Hall.\n\nMount Hunter was busy this year with 22 expeditions attempting the mountain. This resulted in two major accidents with two fatalities and four people seriously injured. There were two impressive and creative first ascents on the technically demanding North Buttress:\n\nScott Backes and Marc Twight in one long 72-hour push climbed a new route called \"Deprivation\" to the right of the \"Moon Flower Buttress.\"\n\nVeteran climbers Michael Kennedy and Greg Child climbed a new route to the left of the Moon Flower Buttress called the \"Wall of Shadow.\"\n\nOn Mount McKinley, the entire South Buttress was climbed for the first time by Tahoe Rowland, Tom Whalen, Marcus Brown, Mark Aspery, and Ron Bauer in May.\n\nIn May Tyson Bradly and John Montecucco made the first ski descent of the rarely climbed Wickersham Wall. They made a unique approach by ferrying loads up to each higher camp and then skiing back down to their camp, in effect, skiing the route bottom to top.\n\nThe \"Ramparts\" located west of \"Little Switzerland\" had a first ascent of P6840 via the Southwest face:\n\nClimbers Billy Shott and Steve Gorhman ascended this 1,700- foot granite wall (5.10 A2) which lies west of P6850, first climbed by Fred Becky and Clay Wadman in 1991. This was the second known ascent in the remote Rampart Range on record.\n\nAccidents/Incidents\n\nFall, fatalities in Ruth Gorge\n\nOn April 24 Walker Parke and Todd McCann fell 1,100 feet while descending the North East Ridge of Mt. Wake within the Ruth Gorge. Parke, McCann, and Michele Morseth took one day to climb 1,800' to their first camp at 5,600' on the route. The following morning the group decided to abandon their climb due to poor snow conditions. At the bottom of their second rappel, Parke lost his balance and fell 20 feet into McCann, who was setting an anchor, but not clipped in. The two climbers fell together and came to a stop at the bottom of the couloir. Morseth was directly across from McCann and witnessed the sequence of events. McCann had multiple traumatic injuries, yet was still alive. Parke was killed instantly from multiple trauma.\n\nJack Tackle and Bill Belcourt were near the scene and heard McCann's call for help. Tackle and Belcourt administered emergency care to McCann and began evacuating him. He died during the evacuation. Meanwhile Morseth retrieved the ropes and descended difficult terrain alone. Tackle and Bellcourt returned to the scene to assist Morseth back to their camp. The morning of April 25 Tackle and Belcourt evacuated Parke's body.\n\nMt. Hunter avalanche, fall, assisted evacuation\n\nOn May 5 Andy Carson and Charles Crago were injured when they were swept 800 feet in an avalanche while climbing the NW Basin Variation route on the West Ridge of Mt. Hunter. Carson suffered bilateral tib- fib fractures, and Crago suffered chest injuries. They were evacuated off the mountain by other climbers in the area. A fixed wing aircraft flew them to an Anchorage hospital.\n\nAMS/HACE, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 13 Mautezio Fasano, a member of the Italian \"Sesia 94\" Expedition, became hypoxic at 16,200 feet. He was lowered by his expedition to the ranger station at 14,200 feet and treated by a doctor. Fasano was diagnosed as suffering with AMS /HACE and flown by the NPS Lama helicopter to the 7,200-foot Kahiltna Base Camp. He was then transported by fixed wing to a Anchorage Hospital.\n\nFrostbite, HACE, fall from Denali Pass, fatality, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 14 Pauline Brandon and Richard Tyler were on their descent of Mt. McKinley when they both fell from or near the 18,000-foot level (below Denali Pass) on the West Buttress. They came to a stop at the 17,200-foot level where they lay unconscious. Sometime later, on May 15, Tyler regained consciousness. He found he had frozen fingers and was unable to walk. Tyler attempted to make verbal contact with Brandon but was unsuccessful. Climbers nearby spotted the pair and provided assistance. Tyler was evacuated off Denali in the NPS helicopter. He was flown from the 7,200-foot base camp to Alaska Regional Hospital by the Alaska Air National Guard. Brandon was evacuated later on 5/15. Tyler lost all digits of both hands from frostbite. An autopsy was performed on Brandon, listed the cause of death as hypothermia with an underlying diagnosis of Cerebral Edema.\n\nSeizures, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 16 John Merrigan was climbing the West Buttress when he began experiencing what appeared to be Grand Mal seizures at 7,800-feet on the Kahiltna Glacier. He was evacuated by Alaska Air National Guard helicopter.\n\nStorm, assisted evacuation on West Rib\n\nOn May 17 an intense wind storm demolished the camp of a guided party on the West Rib. Mountain Trip, a licensed concession led by guide Rodrigo Mujica, were camped at 15,700 feet when the storm blew in. The wind speed during the storm was estimated at 100+ mph. Mujica radioed the ranger station, requesting a rescue. A rescue team attempted to wand a route from 14,200 feet to Mujica's group, but were forced back due to high wind and heavy snow. The rescue team reached the Mujica party at 15,900 feet on the West Rib when the weather allowed. Mujica was credited with saving his clients, and no one was injured.\n\nCall for rescue, self evacuation\n\nOn May 19 an Italian party radioed the 14,200-foot ranger station requesting a rescue. A brief and intense storm blew away their tents and climbing gear. (This one storm resulted in two other incidents as well.) The Italians were above the ice arete at approximately 15,000 feet on the Cassin Ridge. The park service attempted to reach the party but were delayed by high winds. The Italians were able to descend the route on their own. The park service used the helicopter to perform a cargo letdown, which provided the Italians with climbing and survival gear.\n\nHypothermia, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 19 German climbers Paul Laeremans and Ingred Baeyens required rescue while descending the West Buttress route near Windy Corner. They were caught in extremely poor weather and became hypothermic. The NPS helicopter rescued them from 12,500 feet and transported them to base camp.\n\nStorm, hypothermia, fatal fall, body recoveries\n\nOn May 22 Korean climbers Sang Myeung Lee and NPS Volunteer Kee Won Kim departed from 14,200 ft. on Mt. McKinley to climb a headwall 500 yards west of the fixed lines on the standard West Buttress route. They completed the technically moderate 2,000-ft. route in 11 hours but finished in severe weather conditions. Concern for their safety prompted NPS to organize a search team from the 14,200-ft. ranger station camp. The rescue discovered Lee's body clipped to the fixed lines at 15,900-feet. Three hours of searching in whiteout conditions proved futile, and the search for Kim was suspended. The team descended to 14,200 ft. with Lee's body. The search continued with a helicopter and ground parties for 3 more days. On May 25 a guide radioed from 16,200 feet reporting that Kim's body had been found at 16,100 feet hanging in a rock band. Kim's body was recovered by the rescue team. Autopsies revealed both climbers died of exposure.\n\nHACE, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 24 Japanese climber Shji Yoshida was stricken by HACE that left him in a unconscious state at the 11,200-foot camp on the West Buttress. Yoshida was rescued by the NPS helicopter. Yoshida was stricken quickly and very severely for being at such a relatively low altitude. Hypoxia from poor ventilation in his tent may have been a contributing factor.\n\nBroken Hip, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 29 climber Francois Verhoeven broke his hip in a short fall while climbing near 16,500 feet on the West Buttress. Verhoeven was able to descend to the 14,200-foot ranger station where he was evacuated by the NPS helicopter.\n\nCrevasse fall, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn May 30 climber Pat Liske was injured when he fell into a crevasse at approximately 13,600 feet while descending the West Buttress. Liske received blunt trauma to the chest. He was rescued by volunteer climbers and an NPS patrol. On May 31 Liske was evacuated from the 14,200-foot ranger station by the NPS helicopter.\n\nAcute AMS, assisted self-evacuation\n\nOn the evening of June 1, Bennett Austin developed a moderate case of AMS while climbing between 19,000 feet and 19,500 feet on the West Rib route of Mount McKinley. His party called the 14,200-foot ranger station and were advised to administer Decadron and descend immediately. Austin's team climbed up to the Football Field, attempted to make hot drinks and eat, but then decided that they needed to keep moving. The group started descending the West Buttress route. Three NPS volunteers met the group at approximately 17,700 feet and assisted them to the 17,000-foot camp where Austin was evaluated. After six hours of rest and rehydration, the party descended to 14,200 feet, unassisted, where Austin made a full recovery.\n\nIllness, helicopter evacuation\n\nThe US Army Denali Expedition was on their 9th day climbing Mt. McKinley (June 10) when member Jerry Jackson reported stomach pains to the 14,200-foot ranger station. He was diagnosed as suffering from an acute abdomen. Jackson was evacuated on June 11 by the NPS helicopter.\n\nFall, fatalities on Mt. Hunter\n\nOn June 10 mountaineers Patti Saurman and Chris Walburgh died, and David Saurman and Don Sharaf were injured, in a 1,700-foot fall while climbing the Southwest Ridge of Mount Hunter. Recent avalanche conditions and poor slope stability contributed to this accident. D. Saurman and Sharaf were rescued by park rangers and the NPS helicopter and flown to Anchorage where they were hospitalized. P. Saurman's and Walburgh's bodies were recovered on June 11th.\n\nHAPE, helicopter evacuation\n\nOn the evening of June 11, Japanese mountaineer Kazuo Fukase developed a severe case of HAPE at the 17,200-foot camp on the West Buttress. Kazuo's party received instructions for medical treatment via CB radio from the NPS 14,200-foot ranger station. Using oxygen from the 17,200-foot NPS rescue cache and injectable Decadron administered by a climber/doctor on the scene, Mr. Fukase's condition stabilized by early morning when the non-ambulatory patient was evacuated from the 17,200-foot camp by the NPS helicopter. The oxygen and decadron may have saved his life.\n\nHypothermia, frostbite, assisted descent, helicopter evacuation\n\nVictor Pomerantsev departed June 12 for a solo climb of the West Buttress. He arrived at 16,200 feet on June 16. A strong storm blew in over the evening which buried Pomerantsev. Two climbers, John Grieve and Bill Ross, discovered Pomerantsev outside of his tent suffering from severe hypothermia and frostbite on all ten fingers. They provided assistance for six days of stormy weather until they could bring him down on the 22nd to the 14,200-foot ranger station. During this time, the NPS attempted to reach their camp by ground and helicopter but were unable. During the e"
