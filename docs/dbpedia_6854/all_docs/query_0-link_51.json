        "text": "It is a tall order for a training method to live up to the title of this article—but one does. It checks off the following boxes:\n\n☑ Power\n\n☑ Strength\n\n☑ Muscle hypertrophy\n\n☑ Fat loss\n\n☑ “Cardio”\n\n☑ “Work capacity”\n\n☑ Longevity through mitochondrial adaptations\n\n☑ It “gives you more than it takes out of you”\n\n☑ Simplicity\n\n☑ Low time commitment\n\n☑ Adaptability to athletes and non-athletes of all levels\n\nThis method, while it does not maximize the development of any of the above qualities—only a highly specialized method, not a general physical preparation one, could do that—it develops them to levels high enough to successfully compete in amateur sports, excel at physically demanding occupations, and be ready for whatever life throws at you.\n\nMoreover, this method achieves these improvements without compromises common to GPP methods. Examples of such unacceptable concessions include a loss of strength and speed from some types of endurance training; getting sore and trashed and being unable to practice one’s sport, fulfill a military mission, or have a life; improving performance at the expense of health.\n\nThe method is simplicity itself. It relies on two to three—or just one—exercises, most basic equipment or none at all, minimalist programming, and autoregulation.\n\nI will start by giving you a sample training plan, then I will say a few words about the method.\n\nThe plan is one of several in the Kettlebells StrongFirst online course that we developed for BJJ Fanatics.\n\nIt employs one of the all-time best all-around exercises—the kettlebell clean-and-jerk. (The given protocol uses the single kettlebell C&J; the video features single and double kettlebell C&J instruction and plans.)\n\nOnce you get your technique down, identify the optimal size kettlebell.\n\nThe Kettlebells StrongFirst C&J plans prescribe the weights using the repetition maximum (RM)—the number of perfect reps you can do if you go all out during a test.\n\nHere is how to establish your 6-12RM in the single kettlebell long cycle C&J.\n\nAfter a warm-up of choice do an easy set of six reps (C+J+C+J+C+J+C+J+C+J+C+J) with a light kettlebell with your weaker arm. Walk around and in a few minutes repeat with the stronger arm. After your breathing has fully recovered—beyond the talk test—repeat the procedure with a heavier kettlebell.\n\nKeep going up in weight until six reps are challenging. If you can do more, keep going—as long as you do not compromise the quality. Do as many perfect reps as possible and stop. This number is your “repetition maximum” with the given weight.\n\nKettlebells StrongFirst\n\nSingle Kettlebell Clean & Jerk Plan A\n\nTrain twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.\n\nTrain the single kettlebell C&J with your weaker arm’s 6-12RM. Do a set every 30sec: left on the top of the minute and right 30sec into it.\n\nStart with single reps (1C+1J). Carry on until you cannot pass the talk test right before the next set. (I explained the talk test in this article.)\n\nYour performance will fluctuate from day to day; do not be concerned and do not try to “beat” your best result.\n\nWhen you make it to 30min—30 sets per arm—stay there for a couple of weeks until you repeat this workload strongly while passing the talk test any day.\n\nThen add a second clean to each set: (C+J+C). When you make it to 30min with an extra clean, consolidate your gains by staying at that load for a week or two, then add a second jerk: (C+J+C+J).\n\nUse the same two-step procedure (+clean, then +jerk) until you either reach three C&J repetitions every 30sec for 30min (180 cleans and 180 jerks as a sum of both arms) or your progress stalls. Then retest your RM and switch to Plan B.\n\nThe progression:\n\nC+J\n\nC+J+C\n\nC+J+C+J\n\nC+J+C+J+C\n\nC+J+C+J+C+J\n\nEvery fourth week deload by going down a kettlebell size (-4kg per kettlebell for ladies, -8kg for gentlemen)—while maintaining the rest of the load parameters of the last training session (the same sets, reps, and rest periods). Explode!\n\nThe above training plan was designed according to the method we call “A+A.” This snappy acronym by Al Ciampa, SFG stands for “alactic plus aerobic” and describes training that emphasizes the alactic and aerobic energy systems at the expense of the glycolytic system.\n\nAnaerobic glycolysis is the sugar burning that supplies faddish “high intensity interval training” and “metcons.” This highly inefficient process pollutes your body with lactic acid, ammonia, and free radicals and messes with your hormones if you tap into it too much or too often.\n\nA+A, in contrast, relies on the clean burning “rocket fuel” of creatine phosphate (CP) to power high intensity efforts and an equally clean aerobic system to replenish the CP.\n\nA+A is a subtype of Soviet anti-glycolytic training (AGT). The above Kettlebells StrongFirst training plan is based on the research by three professors, three giants, two Soviet and one Swedish: Verkhoshansky, Selouyanov, Åstrand.\n\nHere is how it fulfills the various seemingly contradictory demands:\n\n☑ Power\n\nThis one is obvious: the C&J is a power exercise. If you choose another exercise, make it a power one.\n\n☑ Strength\n\nCarryover from power to strength is well documented. Of course, if you want to maximize your “grinding” strength, you will need to add “grinds” to your training. The given plan leaves you plenty of energy and time to do it.\n\n☑ Muscle hypertrophy\n\nProf. Selouyanov concluded that A+A type training is 50% as effective at building up fast twitch fibers’ myofibrils as specialized hypertrophy training.\n\nUnless you are a bodybuilder, this is plenty of muscular development. A pure “what-the-hell effect.”\n\n☑ Fat loss\n\nSwedish research revealed that high intensity dynamic exercise performed in very short bouts with very short rest periods minimally depletes glycogen and relies on fats for fuel (for nerds, RQ~0.8). This does not jibe with conventional beliefs about fat burning but numbers do not lie.\n\nMoreover, according to Soviet weightlifting research, the first rep of an explosive exercise burns 35% more calories than each consecutive rep. And there are a lot of first reps in this protocol.\n\n☑ “Cardio”\n\nIt is a common myth that anything that raises the heart rate gets the job done. For reasons outside the scope of this article, the exercise must be dynamic, not a “grind,” to do your heart good.\n\nAccording to other Swedish research, the particular loading pattern—brief periods of work and brief periods of rest—result in heart rate dynamics similar to moderate intensity steady state running: the gold standard for heart development.\n\n☑ “Work capacity”\n\nAs with “cardio,” I have used quotation marks around “work capacity” because I am referring to the gym bros’ definition, not a scientific one. Per bros, it is the blue-collar ability to do heavy labor.\n\nA+A feels like chopping trees with an axe and delivers accordingly.\n\n☑ Longevity through mitochondrial adaptations\n\nI explained the role of mitochondria in performance and longevity in this article.\n\nNote that to maximize mitochondrial adaptations you need to choose a power exercise like the C&J, not a strength one like the military press.\n\n☑ It “gives you more than it takes out of you”\n\nPowerlifting coach extraordinaire Louie Simmons famously quipped that, “An exercise should give you more than it takes out of you.”\n\nTo use Soviet terminology, we are after a “low cost of adaptation.” While most all-around training methods like pop HIIT and circuit training beat you and rob your health to pay your sport, A+A builds you up without tearing you down. You will feel fantastic during your training and right after it.\n\n☑ Simplicity\n\nYou have seen it.\n\n☑ Low time commitment\n\nAn hour or two a week for all-around fitness is a great deal for your time spent. Sure, there are other approaches that demand as little or even less time—but they come with many strings attached, as discussed above.\n\n☑ Adaptability to athletes and non-athletes of all levels\n\nAlthough originally A+A was developed for elite athletes, it can be scaled to any level through exercise and workload selection. (In contrast, some powerful all-around methods like The Quick and the Dead work only for experienced athletes.)\n\nA+A Q&A\n\nI am sure you still have many questions about A+A.\n\nWhat exercises are the best kettlebell, barbell, and bodyweight exercises for A+A?… How can it be applied to circuit training?… How long should an A+A session last?… How many times a week should I train?… What is a smart progression?… Is Kettlebell Simple & Sinister A+A?…How to combine A+A work with barbell strength training?… How to make A+A sport specific?… How often should I do glycolytic work?…\n\nI will answer these questions in upcoming issues of the StrongFirst newsletter. It is free. If you have not yet, SUBSCRIBE TODAY.\n\nA+A power to you!\n\nKettlebells StrongFirst—\n\nBehold the power of A+A"
