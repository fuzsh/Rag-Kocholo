On Earth-688, Peter Parker continued to mutate after being bitten by a radioactive spider, eventually reaching a point where he would transform regularly into a monstrous arachnid form, hungering for raw meat and living blood. He had been in a relationship with Gwen Stacy, but at some point his transformations either led to her death or drove her away, leaving him to raise their son Ben alone.

Peter was a largely absent figure in his son's life, focusing most of his attention on trying to find a cure for his mutation, which had been inherited by his son. Realising that his time was running out, and he would die soon, Peter tried to ensure his son would be looked after by arranging for him to be taken in by the Xavier School, but this only further drove a wedge between them, as Ben saw this as an attempt by his father to send him away permanently.

When his son's mutation became public knowledge, Peter publically transformed to defend Ben from an enraged mob. He died protecting his son and buying him time to escape, reassuring Ben with his last words that he was never alone.
