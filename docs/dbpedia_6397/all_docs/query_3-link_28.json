But owner Dave Sharma and other family members were taken to court last year by the B.C. government, which alleged the 17-acre farm was being used for criminal activity. After first denying the allegations in court documents, the Sharma family agreed to settle the claim last October by paying more than $200,000 to the director of civil forfeiture.\n\nByrne said this week the investigation that led police to the farm also resulted in officers preventing some targeted shootings, just as they hope to do with the current gunplay that has left 20 people dead and 20 more injured so far this year.\n\nThe Brothers Keepers, the United Nations and the Red Scorpion-Kang group are just some of the B.C. gangs that have turned public spaces across the Lower Mainland into battlegrounds. There have been murders at malls, outside popular restaurants, in busy parks, on the Vancouver waterfront and even outside Vancouver airport’s international terminal.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPolice throughout the region have ramped up enforcement in recent weeks in response to the escalation in violence. They say they are using both overt and covert measures to tackle the public shootings and put those responsible behind bars.\n\nThis week, both the Vancouver Police Department and B.C.’s Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit took the unusual step of releasing posters featuring gangsters they say could be targeted and warning the public to steer clear of them.\n\nHow are so many shooters able to orchestrate elaborate targeted killings in public spaces?\n\nIt’s because criminal organizations in B.C. have developed tried and true systems to advertise contracts for murder, secure hitmen, provide firearms and stolen vehicles, as well as the means to locate the targets, experts and sources told Postmedia.\n\nWhile some of the methods being used now might appear novel, most have been around for decades.\n\n“I think in some ways, not a lot has changed since the early ’90s,” Gary Bass, a retired RCMP deputy commissioner, said this week.\n\n“We seem to go through spells of these shootings every few months or every couple of years. And generally, they’re very similar in nature, you know, mostly tied to the drug business with some other issues about personal conflicts. But I suppose some might say that some of the shootings have been a little more public than those in the past.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMike Porteous, a retired Vancouver police superintendent, says it used to be “harder and more expensive to do contract killings.”\n\nWhen Hells Angel Donald Roming was shot in a skirmish outside a downtown Vancouver bar 20 years ago, the hitman who hunted the suspects afterwards — killing one of them — was in a different league than those willing to kill today, Porteous said.\n\n“Those kinds of hitmen were more in-house, more professional, probably much more sophisticated,” said Porteous.\n\n“There were less people doing that kind of thing. And they were more highly skilled and probably more expensive. Now there are a lot of the up and comers, unfortunately, that are at a tender age — and I’m talking like no older than 20 — who are stepping into this world.”\n\nAnd, Porteous said, “they are willing to go out and kill people for like $5,000.”\n\nSome of the young gang killers now are trying “to gain notoriety or to gain credibility with more sophisticated gangsters,” he said.\n\n“There is a demand, I guess, to a certain extent if you’re a gangster,” he said. “But you get what you pay for, right? Therefore you get a lot of these ones that are failed.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd sometimes, the rookie killers make mistakes that aid police investigations and land them in jail.\n\nHe pointed to the attempted murder of Hells Angel Damion Ryan in the airport food court in April 2015. Ryan was meeting with United Nations gangster Thomas Duong when a young hitman from Ontario, dressed in a burqa, approached and tried to shoot Ryan. The gun jammed and Ryan fled. The meeting was a setup.\n\nThe inexperienced hitman, Knowah Ferguson, 18, was soon captured and pleaded guilty. He was supposed to get a share of a $200,000 bounty for killing the high-profile biker — who was featured on both police warning posters issued this week.\n\nThe contracts\n\nThere are no Craigslist postings for contract killers.\n\nHigher-level crime groups go through middlemen who find people to take contracts that can pay up to several hundred thousand dollars. Mid-level gangs often use drug-trafficking connections to recruit for murders.\n\nCash is not the only method of payment — one source said younger “hitmen are paid in watches, chains, diamond-encrusted jewelry valued and appraised at $25,000, $50,000, $75,000 or $100K.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCommunication is only done using encrypted communication devices and phone apps that can’t be monitored.\n\nSometimes young inmates in pretrial jails without money or family support are groomed for future acts of violence by gangs who put cash into their canteen funds.\n\nPorteous said it’s very common for crime groups here “to bring somebody in from back east and then fly them back out again. When they’re in town, they do the shooting and then they leave.”\n\nOut-of-province hitters are more challenging to identify “because they’re not known to the members of the police community in this jurisdiction,” Byrne said.\n\nThe firearms\n\nAfter Brothers Keepers gangster Harb Dhaliwal was gunned down in Coal Harbour on April 17, a .45-calibre handgun with a stainless-steel silencer was dropped on the sidewalk beside his lifeless body.\n\nThe alleged out-of-town hitman, François Gauthier, 51, is now charged with first-degree murder and carrying a loaded prohibited firearm. He remains in custody until his next appearance on June 3.\n\nMore professional contract killers usually have all they need for the hit — including access to a firearm, Porteous said.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“You wouldn’t have to supply him with things. You would hire him and he would get the whole deal done, just like you would hire a hitman on TV.”\n\nThose hiring younger killers have to kit them out.\n\n“The farmhouses is a good example of a one-stop shop to get the kind of equipment you need,” Porteous said.\n\nSupt. Duncan Pound, of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit, said there has been a shift in where gangs are getting their firearms since the pandemic began.\n\nBefore the border was closed by the pandemic, about half the crime guns seized by police in B.C. were from the U.S., while the other half came mostly from straw purchasers, he said Friday.\n\nNow, the majority are sourced within Canada here on the West Coast, largely using the straw purchaser method.\n\n“The gangs will try and focus in on someone who can get a valid PAL (firearms licence), that doesn’t have a criminal record. And they’ll pay them cash for firearms,” Pound said. “When we then follow up, we work with the chief firearms officer and we go and knock on the door. And as per the legislation, they’ve got to have it in their house stored securely. Well, they don’t have them anymore. So they end up getting charged.”\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd he said, there’s “zero chance the gang members are going to come back and do a solid and say no, ‘I’ll take the charge for you.’”\n\nPolice are working with the stores that sell firearms to flag suspicious transactions, he said.\n\n“It’s not normal to buy nine Glocks on a Sunday.”\n\nIn January, a new provincial firearms lab opened — speeding up the process of analyzing crime guns.\n\n“We’ve prioritized anything involved in gang shootings,” Pound said.\n\nSo far the lab has handled 800 exhibits — including both firearms and shell casings.\n\nIn several cases, the exhibits have been linked “to more than one crime scene,” he said.\n\nHunting the victim\n\nJaskeert Kalkat’s killers found him in a south Burnaby mall parking lot just minutes after the BK gangster arrived there with his girlfriend and a friend on May 13.\n\nSo how do the shooters know where to go?\n\nThose hunting for targets conduct surveillance in several ways — they will have workers tasked with finding people on the hit list. The hunting crew will drive around following GPS trackers that have been placed on target vehicles they’ve identified.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Then they use free Wi-Fi hot zones to monitor the tracking and look for patterns,” one source said.\n\nThose patterns could show what time of the day someone like high-level UN gangster Todd Gouwenberg goes to the gym. Gouwenberg was fatally shot April 20 about 9 a.m. as he arrived to work out at the Langley Sportsplex.\n\nPorteous said that, in addition to studying their targets’ habits, hitmen also try to lure them to somewhere they’re vulnerable.\n\n“How do they get them to a location that’s agreeable to doing a contract killing? You just can’t pull out of mid-air where he is,” Porteous said. “You get a lot of these things where they try to lure them somewhere, right?”\n\nThey use mutual contacts willing to set the person up. They may even use a current or former girlfriend. Porteous said that happened in 2009, when some United Nations gangsters shot a rival outside a Surrey strip club after being tipped off by a stripper inside.\n\n“This came up a lot at the height of the UN-RS conflict where they were looking for almost anybody in the group,” he said.\n\nIn the current conflict there are overlaps in the social circles of the gangs involved, allowing plotters to get information from people they know who are close to those being hunted.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“You need to understand that at one point in time these guys all used to be friends or knew each other or have people in each other’s groups that were on opposite sides. So they know how they operate and share similar methods of operation,” the source said.\n\nThe getaway cars\n\nThe killer of United Nations gangster Karman Grewal arrived at YVR about 3 p.m. on May 9 in a maroon-coloured stolen Honda Pilot. And after the public shooting, the driver raced away with his hitman passenger, shooting at police like a movie scene.\n\nStolen cars and stolen licence plates like those found at the Sharma farm are the hallmarks of gang hits. Those behind the murder conspiracies find low-level dealers or even addicts to steal the vehicles for them. They sometimes purchase cars on Craigslist and put stolen plates on them, according to sources, some of whom are close to the groups involved.\n\nByrne, the VPD superintendent, said the killer and his associates may park stolen vehicles in several different neighbourhoods before a murder, then decide in the aftermath of the shooting which parked car to drive to.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It is a common theme that we see in these gang murders, where a vehicle will be staged in an area. And that’s why I asked for the public’s help — if you see a suspicious vehicle in your area, and it might have gas canisters in it, call us,” she said recently. “Often they’ll lay down multiple vehicles like that in various neighbourhoods, where they will go to after committing a homicide.”\n\nWhere they park the stolen cars “is dependent on who is the target and the date, the time where they’re going to be. So that is kind of their escape route, for lack of a better word,” Byrne said. “I think targeting someone to murder them is a very fluid operation. And they’re going to make a whole bunch of contingency plans.”\n\nICBC spokesperson Lindsay Wilkins told Postmedia the corporation does not keep separate data on stolen vehicles that may have been used in gang crime.\n\nThe fire\n\nLike lightning and thunder, a gangland murder seems to be quickly followed by a burning vehicle — usually in a neighbouring city.\n\nSocial media videos are posted almost immediately showing the fires and making it seem like a recent hitman trend. But Bass said criminals have been burning their getaway cars for decades, and not just in murders.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen Red Scorpion Jon Bacon was gunned down outside a Kelowna resort in 2011, his killers escaped in a Ford Explorer that they later set ablaze. Despite the condition of the SUV, forensic analysts extracted evidence to be used at trial, until three accused from the UN gang pleaded guilty to their roles in the hit in 2018.\n\nPorteous said the contract killers burn the cars to destroy evidence, but also because that’s what they think they’re supposed to do.\n\n“Without giving away the royal jewels here, we can always gather forensic evidence,” he said. “They’re still kids, right? They hear from other guys, ‘Oh yeah, torch the car.'”\n\nThe response\n\nIncreased street-level enforcement has already led to a number of arrests in the past two weeks.
