        "text": "For other uses of \"The Flash\", see The Flash (disambiguation).\n\n\"For the last nine years, I have watched the people I love suffer and die. I want a better world for my family, for everyone.\"\n\n—Barry Allen[src]\n\nBartholomew Henry \"Barry\" Allen[1] (March 14, 1989[2] - March 14, 2023; resurrected March 14, 2023)[3] is a scientist in the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of the Central City Police Department. He is the son of the late Henry and Nora Allen, the husband of Iris West-Allen, the father of Nora West-Allen and his future son Bart West-Allen, the son-in-law of Joe West and the late Francine West, the brother-in-law of Wally West, the half-brother-in-law of Jenna West, and the archenemy of Eobard Thawne (commonly known as the Reverse-Flash).\n\nBarry's mother was murdered when he was 11 years old on March 18, 2000 and the blame was wrongfully placed on his father. He was taken in by Joe West and ended up staying with him and his daughter, Iris West. Barry dedicated the rest of his life to proving his father's innocence. After the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded, causing a giant thundercloud to form, Barry was struck by lightning from a cloud, falling into a coma for nine months. When he woke up from his coma, Barry discovered that he had developed superhuman speed and various other abilities derived from it. Using these powers to protect Central City, he began acting as the meta-human superhero known as the Flash, initially referred to by the media as the Red Streak, the Streak and the Blur,[4] stylized as the \"Scarlet Speedster\".[5][6]\n\nBarry spent the next several months fighting crime, taking down numerous meta-human villains and other criminal elements, assisted by Team Flash. All the while, he worked with Joe to get Henry out of prison and with Harrison Wells to get faster and develop his abilities. Barry later found out that the latter was the evil speedster Eobard Thawne from the future, having stolen Wells' identity, and the man who murdered his mother. In a final confrontation between the two, Eobard gave Barry the chance to undo what he did in exchange for assistance in returning to his time. Barry decided against doing this, which ultimately led to Eobard's ancestor Eddie killing himself to erase Eobard from existence.\n\nSeveral months later, Barry finally saw his dad become a free man using a video will left by Eobard. It was also at this time Barry came under attack by meta-humans from Earth-2 led by Zoom, another evil speedster who needed Barry's speed to prevent himself from dying. Barry is eventually forced to comply to save Wally West, temporarily becoming a normal human again until Team Flash worked to get him his speed back. Barry soon after defeated Zoom, but not before his father is murdered in front of him. This sends Barry into a depression, and, not thinking clearly, goes back in time to save his mother, creating another timeline.\n\nAfter Barry undid Flashpoint, a causal loop was created with a possible future of Iris dying in front of Barry. A time remnant of Barry from this future was created, and after being shunned for not being the original Barry he became a powerful, mythical, armored speedster, known as Savitar. After his transformation into Savitar, he sought to ensure his existence by murdering Iris in order to drive his younger self into the circumstances that led to his creation. When battling his younger self he referred to himself as the Future Flash. He was later erased from existence after he failed to recreate the circumstances of his own creation. However, this victory was short-lived; Barry was forced to enter and remain in the Speed Force indefinitely to save the world.\n\nBarry was eventually freed thanks to the efforts of Team Flash, though in the process accidentally created more meta-humans. The self-described Fastest Man Alive was forced to take on the Fastest Mind Alive, Clifford DeVoe, who wished to revert humanity to a time before technology. It was also during this time Iris and Barry got married after fighting invaders from Earth-X and Team Flash first encountered Nora West-Allen, not realising until much later on that she was the daughter of Barry and Iris from the future who had traveled back in time to help stop Cicada. Although conflict arose when it came to light that Nora was working with Eobard Thawne in secret, the three of them grew immensely close. However, when Cicada II was defeated, a new timeline was formed, resulting in Nora being erased from the timeline, leaving Barry and Iris devastated.\n\nWhen Barry was \"possessed\" by Ramsey Rosso/Bloodwork after the latter infected Barry's blood cells while he was saving Ralph's life,[7] Cisco nicknamed him Dark Flash. Barry was restored to normal when Allegra Garcia used her powers to cure everyone affected by Rosso's disease.[8]\n\nDuring the Anti-Monitor Crisis, Barry was revealed to be the Paragon of Love. He was one of the only surviving individuals from Earth-1 after the destruction of the Multiverse in the Anti-Monitor Crisis. However, thanks to Oliver Queen's sacrifice as the Spectre, he and the other Paragons were able to defeat the Anti-Monitor after Earth-Prime was created. Barry also founded the Crisis team and worked to honor the memory of his close friend and mentor.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Speed Force, Barry's powers slowly started to run out, forcing him and the team to seek out a way to create a new Speed Force. He also faced new enemies in Godspeed, Black Hole, and Eva McCulloch. While the artificial Speed Force machine succeeded in restoring his speed, it came at the price of Barry losing his morals and emotional attachment, forcing them to destroy the machine. After the sudden return and help of the resurrected Earth-1 Harrison Wells, Team Flash found an alternate usage for the Speed Force machine. Channeling the residual Speed Force energy Iris from her various interactions with speedsters through hers and Barry's love for others into the machine, they were able to restore the Speed Force and Barry's powers.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to Barry, the restoration of the Speed Force also resulted in the birth of three other forces; the Strength Force, the Sage Force and the Still Force. These forces allegedly attacked the Speed Force, forcing her to flee into a human form. Barry went head to head with Fuerza, Psych and Deon Owens, the hosts of the respective forces. However, it transpired that the Speed Force desired to kill all the forces, killing their hosts in the process, an act Barry was staunchly against. Instead, he opted to travel back in time and prevent the existence of the forces to begin with; but he ultimately changed his mind and allowed their existence; while managing to broker peace between the forces.\n\nSoon after, Barry and his team are forced to contend with the brewing Godspeed War, masterminded by an artificial speedster August Heart, who seeks to become the God of Speed by stealing Barry's recently enhanced speed. It's only with the help of many speedster allies, including the revived Eobard Thawne, that August was defeated and incarcerated in Iron Heights.\n\nSix months later the powerful alien Despero shows up in Central City determined to kill Barry for supposedly creating an event that will end the world. After proving his honourableness to the alien, Despero agrees to give Barry seven days to prove he will not cause Armageddon. [9] Unfortunately, events quickly turn sour as Barry is suspended from his job as a CSI at the CCPD, before learning that S.T.A.R. Labs is being shut down and demolished. Barry is forced to destroy Gideon to protect his identity. Not long afterwards, Barry encounters Xotar, where he falls to prey to her abilities, causing him to temporarily lose his mind and mindlessly attack his friends, until he snaps out of it. After later defeating Xotar, Barry, for unknown reasons, attacks Central City, an event caught on the news, although he does not remember doing it. After mentioning celebrating with Joe and Cecile, Barry is stunned to learn that Joe was dead, and had been for six months. After escaping another attack from Despero, Barry, feeling overwhelmed by recent events, calls for Black Lightning’s help at the Hall of Justice. [10] After discovering that Eobard Thawne was behind it all along, he was able to defeat Despero and remove Thawne's speed, finally ending Armageddon.\n\nNot longer after, a powerful entity named Deathstorm appeared trying to take Caitlin as his bride. In the end, Frost sacrificed her life to defeat Deathstorm and save Caitlin.\n\nIn the weeks following these events, Negative versions of the Forces took possession of the Positive Forces through Iris' time sickness and gave Thawne his speed back. In the final confrontation between Flash and Thawne; who had both become gods at that point from absorbing the powers of the positive and negative Forces, after one last warning to his nemesis and with all other options exhausted, Barry killed Thawne by turning his powers against him and broke the Negative Forces' grip on the positives.\n\nOne week after Thawne’s final defeat, a new group of Rogues started collecting the pieces to build a Time Machine for their leader the Red Death. In the end, Barry defeated and imprisoned Red Death and her team.\n\na few weeks after these events, Ramsey Rosso returned to defeat Team Flash and compete his mission. In the process, Ramsey took control of Wally Wests’ mind, and made him kill Barry. Oliver Queen brought Barry back to life approximately ten minutes after he died and helped Barry defeat Ramsey once and for all.\n\nAfter Rosso’s final defeat, the Negative Speed Force chose a new avatar to replace its old one. When it’s new avatar Eddie Thawne accepted its power, Eddie traveled back in time to kill Barry with the aid of all of Barry’s old speedster enemies. After getting through to Eddie and finding harmony between the Positive and Negative Speed Forces, Barry gave his speedster powers to new speedsters.\n\nBiography\n\nOriginal multiverse\n\nEarly life\n\nBarry was born on March 14, 1989, to Henry and Nora Allen as an only child.\n\nWhen he was 6 years old, Barry begged his parents to take him to a science exhibition in Midway City, but they, unfortunately, got a flat tire on the way. The family's car had to be towed to a garage in Masonville, where they were stuck all day. Barry and his parents had ice cream and french fries with gravy for dinner at a small diner and spent the night watching the local fireworks display. Barry would consider this to be one of the happiest memories he ever had with his parents.[11]\n\nBarry and his mother would watch Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra musicals together on rainy nights.[12]\n\nAt some point, Barry met Iris West at school, with whom he became best friends. At the age of 10,[13][14] Barry formed a crush on her. Iris' father, Joe West, as well as Henry and Nora, were all aware of Barry's developing romantic feelings.\n\nOn March 18, 2000,[1] 4 days after his 11th birthday, Barry ran home from school after getting into a fight with some bullies. Though not being fast enough, his mother assured Barry that he had a good heart, and his father was proud of him for winning the fight.[15] Later that night, Barry was comforted by his mother when he admitted he was afraid of the dark. Nora convinced him he wasn't afraid of darkness itself, just being alone in the dark and wished him sweet dreams.[16]\n\nDeath of Nora Allen\n\nThat night, Barry was awoken by a commotion. He went downstairs and saw his mother surrounded in streaks of red and yellow lightning. Barry attempted to reach his mother, but she told him to stay back and amidst the streaks, Barry saw \"the Man in Yellow\" for a brief moment, and his father urged him to run. At that very moment however, Barry suddenly found himself 20 blocks away (because his future self took him away from the Reverse-Flash).\n\nBarry returned home in time to see his father being arrested by police, and was told by his father not to enter the house. He entered, seeing Joe standing solemnly over a body. When he walked away, Barry approached the body and discovered, to his horror, that it was his mother.\n\nFollowing the ordeal, Barry was taken in by Joe and Iris.[15] When Joe and Barry arrived at the West house, Barry was not crying, due to shock.[2] Joe asked Iris to show Barry the guest room, and Barry told Iris that his father did not kill his mother, to which Iris responded that she believed him.[17] Later that night, Iris found Barry crying alone and comforted him.[2]\n\nLiving together caused an inhibitor between Barry and Iris, as growing up in the same household prevented their feelings (at least on Iris' side) from maturing beyond platonic love.[18]\n\nInitially, Henry asked Joe to not let Barry see him. Not knowing this, Barry kept trying to run away to see his father at Iron Heights, and he was caught and stopped by Joe every time; at one point, Barry called him out for it, telling him that he wasn't his father and that he hated him. Eventually, Barry finally reached Iron Heights before Joe could stop him, and he finally came face to face with his father. Henry told him that he simply did not want Barry to see him in prison. Despite this, Barry begged for his father's release, insisting that the man in the lightning was who killed his mother, not Henry. Henry told him that he couldn't help him and asked that he be a good boy and let Joe raise him. Henry was promptly taken away and Barry became more accepting of Joe as his new guardian.[19]\n\nSix months after his mother's murder, Barry was still depressed and became grumpy towards everyone. Seeing this, Joe understood that Barry was acting angry because he didn't want to let the pain of the grief in, fearing his father and mother would be disappointed in him if he did. Joe assured Barry it was okay to let the pain in. Barry finally allowed himself to feel the grief and cried, with Joe comforting Barry and promising that he'd always be there for him.[1]\n\nDuring the first year that Joe took him in, Barry attempted to impress the former by building a robot with wheels for his science fair project, which nearly set the school gym on fire and hurt his teacher, Mrs. Dumas.[20] In school, Barry was relentlessly bullied by Tony Woodward. Joe noticed this and had Barry spar with Iris, who easily beat him. Joe then told Barry that if he ever got into a fight he couldn't win, it was okay to run the other way.[5]\n\nAt the age of 12, Barry went to a reptile camp, which was paid for by Joe.[21] In 7th grade, Barry decided to mix glycerol with an oxidizing agent for his science fair project, believing he would win if he started a chemical fire. Barry got an A, but was suspended.[22] As a teenager, Barry, according to himself, \"lived for danger\", including smoking a cigarette once, which was an unpleasant experience.[23]\n\nIn high school, Barry attempted tryouts for the football team but failed horribly and made Joe swear to never talk about it again.[24] Barry dated Becky Cooper in high school, though she was apparently a \"nightmare\" of a girlfriend.[25] When Barry was 16, he and Iris switched bedrooms so Iris could sneak out the window past curfew, which was 8:00 pm at the time. They told Joe the reason they switched bedrooms was that Barry didn't like the noise from the streets.[26] At one point, Barry and Iris took Joe's convertible out for a joyride and ended up crashing it into an oak tree on Fairmont Drive.[27] Without realizing he was the man who killed his mother, Barry idolized Dr. \"Harrison Wells\" so much that read his biography twice, though he was still left not knowing much about him.[28][29]\n\nBarry graduated from college with a double major in physics and chemistry.[16] It was with this skill that Barry was motivated to study criminology at Central City University[30] in the hopes of proving that his father was innocent in his mother's murder.[31] Barry was hired for the Central City Police Department by Captain David Singh.[32] Shortly after, around 2012, he was the Junior CSI on a murder case in which the victim, Judy Gimlin, was stabbed to death and her husband, Reagan, was the prime suspect, which touched home for Barry. His superior, Detective Ralph Dibny, apparently proved Reagan's guilt by finding the knife used to kill Judy, which contained his fingerprints. Seeing similar circumstances to his mother's murder, Barry decided to delve further into the investigation and tested the knife. The knife actually didn't match the murder weapon used to kill Judy and Barry reported Ralph, who was subsequently fired for planting evidence. This created an enmity between the two.[33]\n\nVisit to Starling City\n\nA year later, in December 2013 when he was 24,[34] Barry arrived in Starling City. He wasn't able to initially get a cab as the driver pulled away, and he soon arrived at Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences Center to investigate a mysterious break-in as a CSI from Central City with a connecting case, where he met Oliver Queen, John Diggle, Quentin Lance, and Felicity Smoak (the latter of whom he had an instant connection with).\n\nBarry was set up in the division with Felicity's help, unknown to Barry, because Felicity believed that they should have used him as an asset considering his work in forensic science. The two began talking, and Barry began speculating about The Arrow and his background, making incisive observations about why The Arrow wore green instead of black, the type of arrows he used, and how he theorized that The Arrow has partners, particularly someone who had a background in computer sciences; all of this unnerved Felicity.\n\nBarry was astounded when Felicity asked him to help with a blood sample from an arrow she received from the police both by her \"connections\" from working for Oliver, and the fact that he was working the same case as The Arrow. During that particular part of their investigation, Felicity invited Barry to a Queen Consolidated function, which was actually a party at the Queen Mansion. However, before the results came in, his cover as a crime scene investigator working for the police was blown by Oliver just after he and Felicity began arguing over a news report about the mass particle accelerator.\n\nIt was revealed that he was just an assistant CSI and there was no connecting case in Central City. Barry explained what happened to him as a child and how it had caused him to begin looking into cases with impossible circumstances, in hopes of one day proving one possible, therefore solving his mother's murder and freeing his father. He was later re-invited by Oliver as Felicity's plus one to come to his home, where he was throwing a party for his mother. When there, Barry apologized to Felicity while they danced.\n\nAfter the party, Barry was contacted by Singh and was told to return to Central City if he hoped to keep his job and revealed the sedative used was ketamine, informing Felicity it should have been easy to track. He tried to catch the soonest train, though missed the last one of the night. He settled down into the train station to wait for the next one in the morning, when suddenly he was hit with a tranquilizer dart to the neck. When he awoke, he found himself in Oliver's base with Diggle watching him and Oliver lying on a table in full Arrow costume. Felicity approached him and asked Barry to save Oliver's life, who was not only poisoned with an unknown substance from the A.R.G.U.S. disaster bunker, but also had been beaten by the robber who had stolen the centrifuge from Queen Consolidated, raided the blood bank, and encountered Oliver as The Arrow while stealing large amounts of ketamine from the bunker.[31]\n\nBarry was able to save Oliver's life by thinning his coagulating blood with rat poison. Oliver was not too pleased with the situation at first, as Felicity had revealed his secret without his permission. However, Barry eventually gained Oliver's trust. He recommended that a mask would be better than the green grease paint he used on his eyes as concealment of his identity. Oliver later asked Barry if there were any side effects to the rat poison he injected in him, and Barry admitted it could cause hallucinations and heavy sweating. After testing Oliver's blood though, Barry discovered that Oliver's hallucinations weren't from the rat poison, and that it was psychological. Soon after, Barry headed back to Central City, but not before leaving Oliver a mask as a parting gift.[35]\n\nThe accident\n\nOn his train back to Central City, Barry encountered Martin Stein and the two discussed physics and Harrison Wells' particle accelerator and how it would change the world.[36] After he got off the train, Barry soon headed back to work, arriving at a crime scene late. He was successfully able to identify the getaway car from the robbery and also grabbed a sample of some animal feces found on the ground, before heading back to his lab to examine the evidence. While processing the feces, he was greeted by Iris. Barry talked on and on about the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator with her, noting that it provided ideas that were far beyond their current capabilities of science, hence why he was so excited. Detective West approached right as the feces had processed. Barry described the results found, explaining that it had a chemical used only at four different farms around town, suggesting they check them out.\n\nFollowing this, Barry and Iris headed to the unveiling and switching on of the particle accelerator. Barry attempted to convey his attraction towards Iris, but she simply misunderstood it. They began listening to Dr. Wells, who described how the particle accelerator would lead to a much greater future. As they were listening, a thief stole Iris' bag, along with her laptop inside it. Barry ran after him, attempting to catch up to him; however, the thief knocked the wind out of him and ran off, only to later get caught by detective Eddie Thawne. At the police station, Iris and Barry mocked Eddie, a new transfer from Keystone City.\n\nLater, Barry headed to his lab, watching the news of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, when it suddenly became unstable. As Barry tried to close his lab's rafters due to the worsening storm, he watched in confusion and awe as the liquids around him suddenly levitated, defying gravity. The particle accelerator then exploded and sent a shockwave of dark matter through the city. Seconds later, Barry was struck by a yellow bolt of lightning through a window in the roof. He was sent flying backwards through the already-charged chemicals and knocked unconscious. A red flash of light appeared across Barry's cheek, rising, and then faded away.[35] Barry was quickly rushed to Central City Hospital, where he was kept on life support while in a coma.[15]\n\nFor the following five weeks, Felicity visited Barry in the hospital while he was in a coma, and left only to help Oliver.[37] Barry constantly seemed to flatline. However, it was concluded by Harrison Wells - who had also started visiting him - that Barry's heart was in fact beating too fast to even register on the EKG.[15] When Barry's condition began to worsen he was moved to S.T.A.R. Labs to be closely monitored and was frequently visited by Iris West.[38] When Iris came by one day, she received a static shock when she touched Barry's hand.[39]\n\nBecoming the Flash\n\nEarly days and setbacks\n\nWhen he woke up from his coma nine months later, Barry met Dr. Wells, Cisco Ramon, and Dr. Caitlin Snow. He learned of his coma and how it had been caused by the particle accelerator explosion. Much to their annoyance, Barry chose to leave, claiming that he felt normal. Barry went to meet Iris at her work, where the two embraced. Iris was incredibly thrilled to see Barry awake and walking. As they talked, Barry noticed time slow down, then speed back up again. Iris grabbed her jacket, then they went to visit Joe at the police department. Joe was more than happy to see Barry, though he was called to a robbery at Gold City Bank. Detective Thawne followed West, while also expressing his happiness at Barry's return. As they left, Barry noticed a rough detainee, who quickly reached for a police officer's gun. Before he could grab it, Barry sped over to him and back, stopping him from doing anything.\n\nFreaked out by the incident, Barry promised to call Iris that night and left. Once outside, Barry noticed his hand vibrating at an unbelievable speed, shortly followed by him accidentally almost running into a bin at super speed, then breaking the back window of a cop car. Realizing the gifts he had, Barry went off running, testing out his super speed. Before long, he accidentally ran through the back of a van. Sometime later at an airfield, Barry met with Cisco, Caitlin, and Wells. He put on a tight suit and got ready to run. Dr. Wells cautioned restraint, whereupon Barry began to run at full pelt.\n\nPartway through his test run, he began to remember the night of his mother's murder, specifically a ball of lightning with a man seemingly inside it surrounding his mother, and he crashed, fracturing his wrist. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, they discovered that Barry's wrist had healed in under three hours, much to their amazement. Dr. Wells inquired as to what happened, and Barry explained what he'd remembered: a man somehow inside a ball of lightning. Barry raised the question that perhaps there were more people like him, but Harrison rejected the idea, claiming that Barry was unequivocally one of a kind. Following that, Barry went to meet Iris at Jitters. He looked upon Iris and Eddie kissing. Barry and Iris soon took a walk as Iris explained to Barry how her and Eddie had met, asking Barry to promise not to tell her father. As they talked, a police car involved in a car chase slammed on the brakes, leading to Barry pulling Iris out of the way as the car hit the wall under the bridge. As the other car raced by, Barry recognized its driver; a man thought to be dead: Clyde Mardon. Barry ran after the car, crashing through the side and entering. Before Mardon could get his gun out, Barry grabbed the steering wheel, making the car tumble on its side and onto its roof. Mardon exited the vehicle, relatively unscathed and Barry quickly followed.\n\nHe called out to catch Mardon's attention, but soon the area was flooded with fog, apparently made by Mardon himself, causing a car to run into the already overturned car, forcing Barry to speed to a nearby patch of grass for safety. Paramedics soon arrived, along with the police, including Joe. Joe scolded Barry for having Iris out in the open and Iris for having followed the danger. Barry took Joe aside, telling him of his belief that the car was driven by Clyde Mardon, who had apparently survived a plane explosion, also somehow gaining the ability to control the weather. Despite various pieces of apparent evidence, Joe didn't believe him. Frustrated with Barry's apparent fantasies, Joe explained how his claims were impossible, including the ball of lightning with the man inside; he knew Barry's father was the murderer, as did numerous others. Having never asked for anything from Barry, Joe asked Barry to for once be realistic, to which Barry simply walked off, disappointed.\n\nHe returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, angry at Wells for lying to him about being the only one affected by the particle accelerator's explosion. Dr. Wells claimed to not be entirely sure, as there had been numerous amounts of radiation including anti-matter, dark energy and x-elements, all apparently theoretical prior to the event. Despite them only being theory up to that point, Wells claimed that Barry was proof otherwise. He went into more detail, explaining that they'd been looking for more \"meta-humans\", a term they'd coined for people like Barry. Barry brought up Clyde Mardon, whom they had to stop before he hurt anyone again. Wells cautioned Barry to keep himself safe, as Barry had the potential to unlock previously undiscovered vaccines, medicines and breakthroughs in science, yet he wished to put himself on the line and \"play hero\". Dr. Wells saw him as nothing special, just a boy who'd been struck by lightning.[15]\n\nUpset by Harrison's words and lack of confidence, Barry called Oliver Queen, hoping to get some advice.[40] He visited Oliver in Starling City, where he expressed that he believed Barry could save people, though in an entirely different way to the Arrow. As opposed to the Arrow's tough vigilantism, Barry could be a guardian angel to the people of his city, saving them \"in a flash\". As he speeds away, Oliver expressed his awe at Barry's powers.\n\nBarry headed back to Central City, to S.T.A.R. Labs. He apologized to Caitlin and Cisco, understanding that they'd lost things in the explosion, but there had been an increase in crime, presumably occurring because of the creation of meta-humans. They agreed to help, and Cisco even suggested the use of a suit he'd made, initially for a firefighter, but believed it suited Barry well. He put on the suit and raced to Mardon's farm, where they'd noticed an acute change in the weather. He saved Joe and Eddie, who'd come to investigate, after a piece of debris flew at them.\n\nWith Mardon's tornado heading towards the city, with an increasing wind speed, Barry suggested that he run around the tornado in reverse in order to unravel it. Despite Caitlin and Cisco's belief that Barry might not hold up, he proceeded to run around it. Before he could run fast enough, Mardon knocked him away. Believing him to be too strong, Barry didn't think he could beat Clyde. However, as he was about to give up, Dr. Wells began communicating with him. Despite acting selfishly, Wells expressed that he truly, deeply believed that Barry was special, that he could help stop the havoc he'd created. With the confidence boost, Barry was able to run fast enough, clocking just over 700 mph, ultimately unraveling the tornado. After being knocked to the ground, both Clyde and Barry stood up. Clyde proceeded to point a gun at him, claiming them to be the same, though Barry strongly disagreed. Before he could shoot Barry, Joe intervened. The following morning, still at the crime scene, Joe and Barry discussed Barry's powers and Joe apologized, for not believing him and for also believing his father a murderer. Barry also promised not to reveal anything to Iris so as to keep her safe. Not long after, Barry visited his father in Iron Heights Prison, assuring him that he still believed in him, that he was incredibly proud to be his son. After that, with a lightning bolt symbol added to his suit, Barry ran through the streets of Central City, saving a man from crashing on his bicycle.[15]\n\nBarry continued to save citizens throughout Central City, much to the frustration of Caitlin and Joe. At his day job with the CCPD, Barry investigated a strange robbery and murder scene wherein the surveillance footage showed one man, but evidence indicated that there was at least six present. He later made a casual remark that the perp's footprints were about the same size as those of Captain Singh's but was reprimanded for it by Joe, who reminded him not to tell Iris about his ability.\n\nLater, Barry went to Stagg Industries with Iris, where Simon Stagg was set to receive an award from Central City University. Iris was covering the event for her journalism assignment and needed Barry to help her with the scientific parts. At the event, the armed gunmen responsible for the scene Barry had just been investigating arrived and were in the process of stealing valuables when a security guard attempted to stop them. Just before they could shoot him, Barry saved him and went after the robbers, only to lose consciousness along the way. After his fainting, this prompted the S.T.A.R. Labs scientists to investigate Barry's recent weaknesses. After a run at a \"Cisco'd\" treadmill, it was discovered that Barry had acute hypoglycemia, a condition that Barry developed because of his sped-up metabolism and could be remedied by a more extensive meal plan. Joe then arrived at the lab and called him out for his unnecessary heroics.\n\nBecause of this, Barry lost confidence in himself and, face to face with Danton Black, the meta-human that infiltrated the Stagg event, he realized that he did not have the ability to really go up against them. At this point, Iris was still trying to get Barry to tell her what was going on with him. Just when he had momentarily quit his association with Wells and the others, Iris revealed that her new journalism topic would be his alter-ego, who has been dubbed the \"red streak\" by citizens. Caitlin then called Barry back to S.T.A.R. Labs and told him of a way to defeat Black. Joe then arrived to convince Barry to go after him.\n\nBarry did and followed Danton to Stagg Industries, where he intended to kill Stagg once and for all. With a pep talk from those at the Lab, including Joe, Barry was able to isolate the real Danton from the hundreds of clones and put him down. When Danton momentarily regained consciousness, he attacked Barry only to miss and hit the window. Barry tried to save him from falling but Danton, not wanting to be saved, summoned up an extra hand to pull himself from Barry's grip and fell, much to Barry's disappointment. Later, Barry commended the group at the lab, who then fully supported Barry's city-saving, even Caitlin, and made amends with Joe.[19]\n\nBarry went to the movies with Iris when Cisco and Caitlin informed him of a car chase. Using his speed Barry quickly stopped the robber and returned before Iris knew he was gone. The next day Barry and Joe investigated the death of the Darbinyan crime family. Noting that as the victims were poisoned with gas they would have all died at the same time, yet some of them had time to move. This led to Barry realizing that they were dealing with another meta-human who could control gas. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Joe brought up the topic of finding a suitable prison for meta-humans. Wells and Cisco decided that the particle accelerator would be the best place to hold them until they could cure them of their powers. Caitlin, remembering the death of her fiancé Ronnie, froze in her spot. Seeing her distress, Barry offered for Caitlin to help him run tests on the poison gas they'd procured. At Barry's lab the two talked about Ronnie until the DNA results came back, revealing that the gas inside the victims also had someone else's DNA. Hearing of the murder of Theresa Howard on the police radio, Barry left despite Caitlin's pleas. Arriving at the scene, Barry found himself too late and angrily chased after the meta-human. Before he could fight him, the man transformed into gas and forced Barry to inhale him.\n\nRushing back to S.T.A.R. Labs, the team was able to painfully extract the gas with a needle. Despite being told to rest, Barry went to talk to Joe and confide in him about his inability to save the judge. He went on to mention his temptation to break his father out of jail, though Joe reasoned that his father would simply be a fugitive, and despite his abilities, Barry would never be able to save everyone. Later Barry apologized to Caitlin for worrying her, only for Caitlin to reveal that what he had said to her were the same last words Ronnie said before he died. Barry decided to help her overcome her fear of walking into the particle accelerator.\n\nAfter finding peace, she thanked Barry and the two embraced. Wells and Cisco soon called them up and revealed that a sedative was also found in the gas. Barry told Cisco to check if anyone was executed on the night of the particle accelerator, as the two chemicals were used when executing death-row inmates. They identified the meta-human to be Kyle Nimbus, a hit-man for the Darbinyan crime family; the family had turned on Nimbus, leading him to be arrested by Joe West and prosecuted by Judge Theresa Howard. Barry quickly suited up and headed to Iron Heights prison, saving Joe who was visiting Barry's father.\n\nBarry then went after The Mist, as Cisco proudly nicknamed him, defeating him by tiring him out (his fatigue would have forced him to revert to his human form eventually).\n\nBarry later visited his father and confided in him that he missed his mother. Henry comforted him by telling him the story of how he learned to walk. Barry realized that to honor his mother he had to continue running, as he had always done.[23]\n\nBarry trained the speed of his mind by multitasking by playing a game of chess with Harrison Wells, a game of Operation with Caitlin, and a game of table tennis with Cisco. Barry defeated Cisco and Caitlin but made a mistake which caused him to lose against Wells. Soon after, they had an alert of a bank robbery, to which Barry responded to quickly. At the scene, Barry managed to unmask Leonard Snart, the leader of his crew. After a guard was shot, Barry quickly rushed him to St. Andrews Hospital and quickly returned to the scene for work. When Captain Singh noted that a guard said there were three robbers, Barry corrected him to four, though he quickly justified his reasoning as it had to have been a four-man job. After Singh sarcastically thanked Barry for his insight, Joe asked if Barry saw anything that could help the case, to which Barry told Joe he saw one of them unmasked. At the precinct, Barry quickly identified Snart and learned that Snart's father was a dirty cop.\n\nLater when Iris brought Barry coffee, Barry was told by Iris that she began a blog about The Streak. Barry attempted to convince her to stop with the blog as it only brings crazies and trolls, but failed. Barry was shocked when he saw Felicity in his lab at the police station. He caught up with Felicity and he learned Felicity listened to his entire conversation with Oliver on the rooftop. Barry showed Felicity his powers and brought her to S.T.A.R. Labs. When asked if they could trust Felicity, Barry told Cisco and Caitlin that she works with The Arrow, reassuring them. Barry showed his powers again, using the treadmill where Barry attempted to show off by running backwards, though he failed When Barry brought Felicity to Jitters, he was invited by Iris to join her and Eddie at Trivia Night and to bring Felicity.\n\nWhen Iris asked why Barry wasn't dating Felicity who she claimed to be the perfect girl for him, Barry stated that they were only friends. At trivia night, Barry and Felicity answered a majority of questions correctly. Iris then pushed Barry to ask Felicity out again, assuming Felicity was very interested in Barry based on how she dressed. After Snart was spotted, Barry left and had Felicity cover for him, though she had no excuse that could work for him. Barry arrived in time to save Joe and a few others but due to the fact he was struck by the cold gun when saving Joe, he was slowed down and failed to save a security guard.\n\nBarry later was furious at Cisco for building the weapon which caused the death of a man. Barry felt betrayed as he was never notified of such a weapon, and this meant he was unprepared. Barry quickly learned Cisco originally made the gun to be used on him, had he gone uncontrollable. After the team tracked Snart, Barry decided to take him on his own and turn off all communications. When Barry confronted Snart, Snart noted that Barry's weakness was his altruism; his need to always save others, rather than going after the villain. Snart froze the wheels of the train, causing it to derail as he fled. Barry, having no choice, managed to rescue all passengers though he was attacked by Snart. Before Snart could finish him, Barry was saved by Cisco, Caitlin, and Felicity. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry said his goodbyes to Felicity, though he later chased after her and hopped on her train. The two had a conversation about relationships before sharing a kiss.[41]\n\nBarry was hanging out with Cisco, Caitlin, Iris, and Eddie at a bar where he discovered that because of his high metabolism he could not get drunk. Suddenly an explosion was reported at a building Barry raced over to see a window washer about to fall, thinking of no other way to save him Barry asked Cisco and Caitlin how fast he would need to go to run up a building. They told him that if he moved at extremely fast speeds he would be fine but must maintain his speed on the way down or risk serious injury. Barry rescued the man but was seen by Iris; blurring his face so she wouldn't recognize him, he quickly left.\n\nLater as police investigated, Barry informed Joe that he could find no bomb casing. Searching through the files using his powers Barry found some information that pertained to the incident. Back at the police station Barry was told by Joe to give the military everything they had on the case. Barry handed the files over but, using his speed, managed to snatch one file from them. Joe told him to consult with the crew at S.T.A.R labs. At the lab Barry told them of what happened. Wells was familiar with Wade Eiling, the general leading the investigation. Wells explained that he worked with Wade to develop gene therapies for soldiers while Wells was more concerned over its benefit to civilians, only for him to sever their partnership when he found out Eiling's plans to develop mind-reading abilities for interrogation purposes. Cisco went through the army's digital records where they discovered the culprit was a woman named Bette Sans Souci, a bomb specialist for the army.\n\nBarry found Bette at her last known address however when tried to take her in, contact with her caused his clothes to begin to detonate. Bette told Barry to get out of his clothes before they exploded which he did, just barely escaping the blast. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs Barry told a distraught Cisco about the suit and revealed to the others she was a meta-human. Joe came to him and asked Barry why he didn't tell him Iris saw him the other night. Barry told him she caught him off guard so Joe told him to tell Iris to stop blogging about him. Barry begged Iris to stop but she refused, claiming that he himself had wanted to know about the impossible since they were young. Barry noted that she wasn't even putting her name on it; Iris told Barry only to talk to her when he was ready to tell her the truth about why he was being so skeptical.\n\nCisco and Caitlin called and told him that Bette was spotted at the location of the surgeon who experimented on her. Barry arrived just in time to save Bette from being captured. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs the others told Bette of how the Particle Accelerator explosion and how it changed her. As they examined her Caitlin discovered a tracked inside her graze wound when the army attacked her, leading Wade right to S.T.A.R. Labs. The others quickly got her out while Wells stalled Wade. Outside while testing her abilities, Bette asked Barry if the others had tried to help him find a cure. Barry told her how a friend once told him that the bolt struck him for a reason and now because of it he can help people. Joe called and told Barry that Iris put her name on her blog.\n\nBarry confronted her as the Flash and told her to stop writing about him. Iris revealed that to him that she was writing to help Barry prove that the impossible does exist. Barry arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs where the others revealed to him and Bette that curing her was at the moment impossible. Barry suggested that she join their team but the others pointed out that Bette's powers were too destructive and could put them all in danger, despite Barry pointing out she was the first meta-human they encountered who was not a criminal or a person who deliberately used their powers to hurt others. Back at his lab in the police station Barry met up with Joe. He told him that by visiting Iris as the Flash he found out that Iris was only writing about him to help. Barry pointed out that the only way to get Iris to stop was to tell her the truth claiming he told her everything only for Joe to reveal he knew Barry had feelings for Iris since he was a child and noted that Barry has not told Iris his feelings about her.\n\nBarry claimed it didn't matter since she was already dating Eddie but Joe told him that when fate wants something to happen, whether it be him getting hit by the bolt that gave him his powers or getting two people to fall in love, it works things out. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs the others told Barry that Bette had left without saying where she was going. When they finally found her about to engage Eiling and his men, Barry rushed to her location before she could kill him. As Barry talked her out of killing Eiling, the general shot her killing her. As her body began to detonate the others told Barry to get her remains out of the city. Barry asked them how fast he would have to go to run on water. The team guessed about 650 miles per hour but told him he must escape the blast once he dropped her. Barry did and just barely managed to outrun the shock wave.\n\nLater as Eiling covered up the incident Barry expressed disappointment, as Eiling had killed Bette in cold blood right in front of him and yet they could do nothing to him. Caitlin tried to comfort him telling him that running on water put him in interesting \"company\". Back at Joe's house Barry told Iris about his situation with Bette without telling her the specific details and asked her one more time to stop writing about The Streak. Iris once again refused, forcing Barry to tell her that they should not talk to each other for a while.\n\nLater Barry visited Iris once again as The Streak and tried to convince her to stop writing about him. However she ignored his request and instead tried to find out more about him. She then asked what she should call him with Barry claiming anything would be better than \"The Streak\". Their conversation was cut short when they heard sirens. Rushing to the crime Barry saved a kid who was about to be run over by the culprit. Cutting the criminal off, Barry discovered he was a meta-human when the man ripped the door off of the Humvee he had stolen and threw it at him. Barry dodged this and attacked the man, only for his skin to turn into a steel like substance, resulting in Barry injuring his hand and the man brutally back handing him. Beaten, Barry escaped but not before the criminal told him that he was \"born to take a beating\", a phrase that seemed familiar to him. Rushing back to S.T.A.R Labs, Barry passed out on the floor.\n\nCaitlin examined his injuries and told him he had various fractures, a concussion, and a bruised spleen, the injuries being so severe that Caitlin told him even with his healing abilities it would take a couple hours for him to recover. Barry then told them about the meta-human's abilities, and asked how he was supposed to fight a man made of steel. Dr. Wells and the team assured him that they would find a way. The next day Barry reported to the Central City Police Department, where he confirmed with Joe that the metal man was indeed a meta-human. Joe told Barry that he was putting him and Eddie on the case so that Barry could explain to Eddie what he saw.\n\nBarry then went to see the Central City District Attorney, who identified the \"man of steel\" as Tony Woodward. Barry recognized the name; Woodward was a former classmate of Barry and Iris’, who bullied Barry throughout his childhood. After the meeting, Barry and Eddie ran into Iris. Eddie asks Barry what's going on between Iris and him, not knowing that Barry was avoiding Iris but Barry told him everything was fine.\n\nAt S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry was introduced to a girder dummy built by Cisco so Barry could learn the right speed to take down Tony Woodward. Barry was easily defeated and dislocated his shoulder in the process. Shortly after, he was called by Eddie who had found the missing Humvee. Barry responded and as he arrived, Eddie recommended that he should get a car. Eddie then asked what's happening between him and Iris again where Barry revealed they had a fight.\n\nBarry and Eddie then headed to Rusty Iron Ale Brewing Co. after suspecting he had dropped by there due to the kegs in the trunk. After questioning a few men at the brewery, one man ran, Barry and Eddie chasing him. Barry ran in front of the two, where the man punched Barry though it slowed him down enough for Eddie to take the man down. They then learn that Tony supposedly died in an accident, though they revealed to the man that he lived. Barry visited Iris at Jitters again where he told her that Tony is an example of why she should stop blogging about him. As the cops arrived, Barry ran off to Tony's hideout.\n\nBarry was easily defeated by Tony and rendered unconscious. After he was brought back to S.T.A.R. Labs, he was yelled at by Harrison Wells who reminded him that they were still finding a way to stop him. Barry was then told that they had found a way to stop Tony and that is to hit him at 837 mph. At the precinct, Barry and Eddie discussed being victims of bullying as kids, while blowing off steam using a punching bag. They were soon told that Iris was missing and the two quickly rushed to help. After learning a fire alarm went off at his old elementary school, Barry quickly realized that was where Tony and Iris were. Barry fought Tony but was once again defeated. Barry then ran away from the school, 5.3 miles exactly, then ran back towards the school, breaking the sound barrier and knocking Tony down. Barry then greeted an incarcerated Tony, revealing his identity and told him that the particle accelerator made them who they truly were.\n\nAfter walking away from the makeshift prison, Barry celebrated as he had finally had his revenge on Tony. Barry then greeted Iris at Jitters and the two reconcile. When Iris told Barry more about \"The Streak\", she told him how he comes and goes in the blink of an eye, and Barry interrupted her saying he does it in \"A Flash\".[5]\n\nBarry went for an early morning coffee run at Jitters, though a trainee was working that morning. After a woman complained about it, Barry sped past and got everyone their coffee and left a large tip for the trainee. As he left Jitters, a man grabbed him and asked for his wallet. Barry laughed at the man, as he chose him out of everyone else in the city. Barry proceeded to take a majority of the man's clothes off and brought a police officer to him as he ran away. Barry later was called to a crime scene where a man was burned to death. Joe said Barry had to ID him though Eddie asked how Barry was going to do so with the man's face melted off.\n\nBarry then bragged about his \"mad skills\". Barry then brought the photo of the man to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they managed to ID the man as Casey Donahue. Shortly after, the man's ID was used at an electrical plant, which Barry quickly responded to. When Barry arrived, he encountered Farooq Gibran, a meta-human who has the ability to drain electricity. Barry made a few attempts to avoid his attacks though he was soon struck by Farooq. Barry later tried to run away, though to his surprise, he had lost his super speed. At S.T.A.R. Labs, they had tested him on the treadmill, though to everyone's surprise, Barry ran slow, even for a normal person.\n\nBarry warned Barry about the meta-human who siphoned his abilities and killed the man. Barry later bumped into William Tockman at the precinct, who had complimented him for his watch. At S.T.A.R. Labs, they managed to identify the meta-human who shortly arrived at the lab, demanding to see Harrison Wells. Wells shortly told Barry that they could try jump starting him to regain his speed which Barry quickly agrees to. When Farooq broke into the lab, Barry tried to talk sense into him but Farooq only struck Barry. Cisco managed to close the doors to hold Farooq off for a short while. Barry and Caitlin then went to the treadmill to jump-start his powers. When Cisco turned the power back on, Caitlin was hesitant to follow through as she was afraid he would die.\n\nBarry told Caitlin that if she doesn't follow through, they would all die. When Caitlin made an attempt to jump start Barry, they learned that it had failed. Barry and Caitlin then witnessed Tony get defeated by Farooq. Barry asked what he was doing outside of the prison where Tony reminded him he never steps away from a fight. Tony then told Barry and Caitlin to get out as Tony died. Barry was then furious at Wells, who had used Tony to buy some time. They then noticed that Barry's cells were still regenerating though Barry still didn't have his speed. Cisco and Caitlin then believed the reason he had yet to regain his speed was because it was mental and he didn't believe enough. When they made an attempt to escape the lab, they were attacked by Farooq. Wells then finally faced Farooq.\n\nWhen Farooq attacked Wells, Barry finally believed enough to regain his speed and save Wells. Barry faced Farooq once more but this time he has connected to his powers and the energy overwhelmed Farooq, killing him. Barry then rushed to the precinct, worrying that something had happened to Iris. He was relieved when he saw her safe in Joe's arms. After they locked up Farooq's body, Caitlin noticed that Barry's cells were regenerating faster than before. Barry payed Eddie a visit at the hospital. After Iris left to grab a coffee, Barry briefly left and had a conversation with Iris as the Flash. Barry then told Iris he would never be late again and that Iris is worth being on time for. Barry then ran off and returned to Eddie's hospital room.[28]\n\nBarry arrived at a bank that Roy Bivolo was robbing, only to find everyone attacking each other. Barry managed to save a man from being shot just as everyone began to recover. When Joe and a few other police arrived at the scene, Barry suggested to Joe that the people were \"whammied\". At the precinct, Barry learned that Eddie finally believed the Flash's existence though he learned Eddie believes he's a menace. Barry proceeded to steal Captain Singh's lunch as he went to S.T.A.R. Labs to discuss the new meta-human. Shortly after, Iris called him out through her blog. Before Barry left, Caitlin told him not to get involved in Iris and Eddie's relationship as he would be responsible for their breakup. When Barry arrived at Jitters, he told Iris his name was Ralph.\n\nBarry was warned by Iris that Eddie was pushing to get him behind bars. Barry managed to get to the storage facility Roy was hiding at before Joe and two other police officers could be killed. Barry was then greeted by Oliver, who had arrived in time to injure a \"whammied\" police officer. Barry then raced to the barn Oliver, Felicity, and Diggle were hiding at. When he arrived, he bragged how he gave Oliver a half an hour head start, yet still beat him. Barry asked the three what they were doing in Central City where he learned they were investigating a homicide which possibly connected to Central City, due to the material of the boomerang used to kill. Barry suggested that the two teams should work together, though Oliver refused as he didn't want anymore people in on his secret. Barry then carried Felicity and took her to S.T.A.R. Labs as she volunteered to go help. Barry was later told by Harrison and Joe not to trust Oliver as they feared he was too dangerous. The following day, Barry met up with Oliver and Felicity at CC Jitters, where Barry learned that Oliver had helped get the name of the meta-human. Barry was then asked by Iris how he knew Oliver Queen. She then sarcastically said that Oliver's arms were twice the size of his and told him that Oliver was on her top 3 cheat list. Barry was then glad when Oliver decided to work along with him.\n\nThe following day, Barry arrived late for the training, despite his speed. Barry was told by Oliver that he always ran in blind and he has a lot to learn. Barry was told to run a distance and run back where he'd get shot by an arrow where Barry told Oliver he wasn't going to be shot. Barry proved him wrong by catching the arrow though he was struck in the back by 2 bolts which Oliver had set up. At the precinct, Barry was told once again not to trust the Arrow, though Barry defended him, saying he's the reason they had Bivolo's name. Barry then decided to cut off the partnership and go after Roy himself. Barry was whammied by Roy but he believed there was no effect on him. Barry proceeded to bring up Ronnie in front of Caitlin. He later met up with Oliver where he told him that he believed Oliver was jealous of him. At the precinct, Barry lashed out at Captain Singh. Later on, Barry attacked Eddie and threw him out of Iris' car. As he was about to beat Eddie, Barry was snared in a grappling arrow from Oliver.\n\nBarry then pulled the rope from the arrow and dragged Oliver down an alley. When Oliver fired two arrows, Barry dodged them, believing Oliver had missed, though he failed to realize there was an electricity box behind him. Oliver then injected Barry with two thousand milligrams of horse tranquilizer, though his metabolism burned it all off. Barry then ran circles around Oliver and as Oliver used one of his arrows to get on the roof, Barry reached the roof first and knocked Oliver down. Barry then dodged a few hits from Oliver before punching him several times. Barry then caught two arrows which Oliver had set up to his motorbike.\n\nBarry was then shot in the leg with a flechette and then held by Oliver as Joe and Harrison arrived to reverse the effects from Bivolo. Barry and Oliver went on to take down Bivolo and look him in the prison in S.T.A.R. Labs. The following day at Jitters, Barry apologized to Oliver for his actions and his words, but was then warned by Oliver that guys like them can never get the girl because of what they do.\n\nThat night, Barry visited Iris at Jitters, though he learned Captain Singh had called the task force to bring him in. He apologized for his actions, but Iris proceeded to tell him not to see her again. He again apologized for his actions and Iris apologized too. Barry then sadly ran off into the night.[42]\n\nBarry arrived in time to intercept two boomerangs from striking Oliver. Barry ran to the arrow-cave and performed the salmon ladder at super speed in front of Caitlin and Felicity. Barry then stated the salmon ladder made him hungry for sushi, which he quickly grabbed before rushing back. When Barry returned to the Arrowcave, he had blown his identity to Lyla Michaels, who he thought was Diggle's wife. Barry offered to help with the case, though Oliver told him that things are a lot different.\n\nBarry told Oliver that he had begun to approach cases more carefully rather than just running into them. Oliver then accepted his help and told Barry they needed to reassemble the boomerangs to which Barry did swiftly. Barry and Oliver visited Quentin Lance where Quentin had forgotten his name and believed it to be \"Bart\". Quentin also believed that Barry was hit by a bus, rather than lightning, though Barry corrected Quentin. Barry asked Quentin about Klaus Markos where he learned enough information to track Klaus down. Barry was later surprised that Oliver was part of the Bratva, where Oliver told him that he's no longer a member. At the Bratva's hideout, Barry managed to subdue the members before Oliver arrived. After Oliver tortured Klaus, Barry brought Klaus to the Starling City Police Department and cuffed him to a drawer.\n\nWhen Barry returned, he admitted that he should have listened to Harrison Wells and Joe West. When Oliver told him that Starling City isn't always sunny and that he had friends and family murdered, Barry interrupted Oliver, saying he watched his mother get murdered also. Barry then told Oliver that he doesn't use his own personal tragedies to torture whoever pissed him off. Oliver then made it clear to him if his way of dealing with criminals was too hard then Barry was not allowed to stay and help. When they believed they had tracked Digger Harkness, Barry and Oliver arrived at the warehouse, though they realized that they were played. When they returned, they found Lyla in critical condition where Barry rushed her to Starling General Hospital. After Oliver blamed himself, Barry reassured him it wasn't his fault.\n\nWhen Oliver told Barry that everything he had been through taken away his humanity, Barry told him his humanity is what got him through everything. Barry and Oliver arrived later arrived a the train station where they had tracked Digger. Digger told them that they can stop him, or 5 bombs from detonating. Barry left to defuse the bombs while Oliver dealt with Digger. When Barry arrived at the first bomb, the team quickly realized that the bombs are linked and if one is defused, the remaining will detonate. Cisco told Barry that he needed to cut all 5 wires at the same time though Barry reminded him he wasn't Multiplex. Barry then quickly grabbed Felicity, Caitlin, Roy, and Cisco to the other four bombs where the five of them managed to cut the wires simultaneously and stop the bombs from detonating. At the arrow-cave, Barry was surprised when he had a mannequin set up for a future team-up. When Oliver said he will still be calling the shots, Barry told him that they'll see about it. Barry and Oliver then went to a warehouse to settle once and for all, who would win in a fight. Before the dueled, Barry told Oliver that he could still inspire people, but as Oliver Queen. Barry managed to catch two arrows from Oliver before charging towards him and dodging multiple arrows.[43]\n\nBarry visited the West household for Christmas. When he set up the Christmas tree using his speed, he was told to remove what he had added as the only red suited man Joe wanted to see in the house was Kris Kringle. Iris shortly arrived with eggnog using her grandmother's famous recipe. Barry and Iris shortly exchange gifts where he gave Iris a replica of her mother's wedding band. Iris gave Barry a microscope which she thought was lame but Barry claimed he loved it. They were shortly interrupted by Eddie who joined them for tree trimming. Barry went to S.T.A.R. Labs where he brought the team gifts as well as Grandma Esther's eggnog.\n\nAfter an attack at Mercury Labs, they discovered it was the work of the man in yellow. Barry quickly wanted to go after him but was told by Joe that the speedster took all the evidence and threatened to kill Iris. At the precinct, Barry had memories of the night as he looked upon his bulletin board. He was visited by Iris who had been calling his name multiple times. Iris told Barry that Eddie had asked her to move in and she said yes. She then asked if Barry had feelings for her as Eddie was under the influence that he liked her. Barry quickly denied the suggestion.\n\nAs Iris left, Barry sulked to himself but moments later saw the man in yellow, the Reverse-Flash, watching him just across from the precinct. Barry chased after the Reverse-Flash and begging to know why he killed his mother, but the Reverse-Flash told him if he wanted to know he'd have to catch him. The two race down towards a stadium where they battled though Reverse-Flash quickly defeated Barry. Barry asked the Reverse-Flash who he really was but the man claimed Barry already knew who he was, that they had been fighting each other for years. As Barry tries to fight back the Reverse-Flash subdued him and told Barry it was his destiny to die at his hands, just like it was mother's. The following day, Barry told the team about what had happened. After Barry believed he couldn't catch him, Wells reminded that force fields are impervious to speed.\n\nBarry and Joe are visited by Tina McGee at the precinct who brought an unsigned warrant. Barry blackmailed Tina into giving them the tachyon prototype within the hour. Barry was then told by Joe and Wells that it's best for him to stay away while they capture the man in yellow. Barry argued that it's his fight though they still shut him down. Barry visited his father and told him that he had found the man who murdered Nora. When he apologized for failing to catch the man, his father reassured him that it wasn't his fault. Barry was then told to stop pursuing that man as everything that happened to Barry was influenced by the murder. His father noted that he had given up the chance to be with Iris because he was too consumed with what happened. His father then told Barry to not let the man take anymore from him. Barry then went to visit Iris and confess his feelings, leaving Iris in tears.\n\nBarry received a text from Caitlin that Reverse-Flash was attacking S.T.A.R. Labs. When Flash arrived he attacked the Reverse-Flash though was quickly defeated again. Before the Reverse-Flash can kill him however Flash is saved by a seemingly alive Ronnie who quickly fled shortly after. Back at the precinct, Barry and Joe recount the early days of Barry moving in. Joe claimed that Barry changed the atmosphere of the house and asked Barry to move back in. They then return to Joe's home for a Christmas gathering where he gave his best wishes to Eddie and Iris.[16]\n\nUpset he couldn't stop the Reverse-Flash in their last encounter, Barry trained harder. He had Cisco use a drone to fire ammunition at him, all of which he evaded. He then had Cisco fire a missile, which Barry successfully grabbed and threw towards the drone. Shortly after Snart re-emerged, Barry quickly realized Snart was setting a trap for the Flash. Barry vowed to take Snart down but Wells told Barry to set his priorities straight and focus on taking the Reverse-Flash down. Barry went to Joe and told him he was going to focus on the Reverse-Flash and left Snart to Wells and Cisco, much to Joe's dismay. At S.T.A.R. Labs, after Caitlin brought up how Ronnie brought her scuba diving, Barry realized Firestorm wasn't a word but indeed an acronym.\n\nAfter Leonard Snart and Mick Rory steal the Fire & Ice painting from the Rathaways, many of the CCPD were injured and Barry admitted to Joe he should've listened and focused on the current situation. Wells apologized to Barry for pushing him to focus on the Reverse-Flash but Barry told Wells he made the decision on his own. After Snart and Rory made their public address to the Flash, Barry goes after them, making himself public for the first time. Though Snart and Rory get the upper hand at first, Barry realized in order to cancel the two's weapons out, he had to move slower. When Leonard told Barry he won this time, Barry responded that there won't be a next time. The following day, after Iris had moved out, Barry moved back in with Joe.[44]\n\nWith the assistance of his team, Barry took down the Royal Flush Gang with ease. When he returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, the team took a group photo. After Wells was attacked by Hartley Rathaway, Barry went over to his mansion. When he noticed the shatter of the glass, he realized it couldn't have been a teenage prank. At his lab at CCPD, Barry demonstrated how Hartley likely used some sonic technology when he attacked Wells. After Eddie reported an attack on Rathaway Industries, Caitlin called Barry but Barry told Caitlin he already knew why she was calling.\n\nOriginal timeline: Barry quickly took down Rathaway, who told Barry he can hear Cisco, Caitlin, and Wells through the radio waves. After Wells admitted he knew the chance of failure of the particle accelerator, Barry told Wells he owed Caitlin and Cisco more than an apology, as they stuck around when everyone abandoned him. Later that night, Barry and Iris had a coffee at Jitters discussing how people they admire aren't who they seem to be. When Hartley broke out of the prison, Barry rushed to S.T.A.R. Labs though Hartley had left by then. When Hartley attacked the Keystone Cleveland Dam, Barry rushed over and arrived in time to save a woman who Hartley threw off. Hartley used the data on Barry's molecular scans to stop Barry once he was disarmed. Hartley was then stopped after the team hacked into the frequencies after the cars at the dam to send out waves powerful enough to stop Hartley. When Wells told Barry he wished to regain the trust of the team one day, Barry told him he already had.[45] Due to a timeline change caused when a future version of Barry time-traveled from 2016, most of these events have been erased and replaced by the following.\n\nCurrent timeline: When dealing with Rathaway, Barry was taken away by another version of himself, who tranquilized him and switched their Flash emblems in order to temporarily replace him. Barry later awoke and rushed into S.T.A.R. Labs, asking where the other Flash was. The other Barry explained that he was him from the future and was being chased by a Time Wraith. When older Barry tried to run back to his time, the Time Wraith caught up to him, so younger Barry attacked it, diverting it long enough to allow his older self to return to the future as the Time Wraith followed him.[46]\n\nBarry saved a couple from a burning car, Cisco told Barry he couldn't be mad for dirtying his suit, to which Barry asked when he could start calling it \"his\" suit. While Barry was investigating Clay Parker, he was greeted by his father. When Barry brought the DNA samples to S.T.A.R. Labs, they realized Shawna Baez was also involved. Barry and Caitlin discuss how they both don't have much of a social life where they were interrupted with a sighting of Shawna Baez and Clay Parker. Barry rushed to the scene and was shocked when he learned Shawna can teleport. He was shot at in the neck by Clay Parker but managed to stop the bullet, though the two escaped. Barry stopped by to help Iris with a report, though she already had plans with Eddie.\n\nBarry then decided to drop by a south-side dive bar with Caitlin to check if Shawna and Clay returned to old habits. After Caitlin had a few drinks, she walked up to the stage drunk and called Barry out to join her. The two then sang \"Summer Nights\" where Caitlin was shocked Barry could sing well. After their duet, Barry was greeted by Linda Park, who offered him her phone number. Barry then took Caitlin back to her apartment and put her to bed. The following day, Barry teased at Caitlin for what happened the night before. Barry was called and told that his father was beaten by Julius.\n\nBarry asked who attacked him and went after Julius. Barry broke Julius out and told him he wouldn't return him to prison, causing him to face more time if he didn't give him Clay and Shawna's next heist. After Barry was told they were in St. Louis, Barry decided to leave Julius out for beating his father. While chasing Clay and Shawna, Barry busts out all the lights in the tunnel they were in, disabling Shawna's teleportation abilities and locking her in a one way glass. Later, Barry decided to call Linda Park and asked her to go on a date. Barry gave Iris information on Clay Parker to use for a report for the Central City Picture News. He then picked Linda up and the two go for a date. That night, Barry went back to Iron Heights to check on his dad. When Henry began putting the pieces together that Barry was the Flash, Barry claimed he would've told his dad if he was the Flash. Barry was then told that the world is dangerous and told to be careful and that his father was proud of him for saving many lives.[47]\n\nBarry took Linda on a dinner date at a Mexican restaurant. While Linda went to wash her hands, Barry was notified of a robbery at a convenient store and quickly settled the robbery. The following day, Barry had another date with Linda but had to end the date early after Wells and Caitlin spotted Firestorm. Barry tried to stop Firestorm and told him they could help but Firestorm attacked Barry and flew off. Barry and Caitlin then tried a different approach, bring Martin Stein's wife along this time, which Martin finally agreed to get help. Linda called Barry to break up with him as she felt he didn't care enough in the relationship as he often ran off and made excuses. Linda told Barry that it's hard to date someone new when you aren't over someone and understood.\n\nBarry went to ask Iris why she told Linda he had feelings for her still and told Iris he no longer had feelings for her. At S.T.A.R. Labs, the team learn that Ronnie and Martin could go nuclear and level the entire city, unless the host body was killed. Barry went to offer Ronnie/Martin some pleasantries though Ronnie told Barry he overheard the conversation. Barry went to Central City Picture News and told Linda he was going to eat a ghost pepper if she didn't agree on another date. Barry took a bite after she believed he was bluffing and Linda agreed to go on another date and offered him some milk. Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs and the team decide to use a quantum splicer on them two separate but learn Martin had left already. Barry and Caitlin rush over to Martin and the two told Martin that they have a way to separate them.\n\nAfter the quantum splicer was placed, Firestorm reacting, believing they had failed, Barry grabbed Caitlin and ran off to safety as an explosion set off.[36]\n\nAfter they got to safety, Caitlin worried they were exposed to radiation, though Cisco informed them there were none. They went back and were pleased when they learned they successfully separated and took them back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry was contacted by Joe and was informed what he learned with Cisco the previous day. They brought the news to Wells who told them time travel is indeed possible. Barry then went to ask more about time travel with Martin Stein who suddenly had a panic attack when General Eiling attacked CC Jitters.\n\nBarry rushed over to stop Eiling but the latter used kinetic needles to stop Barry. They later learn that Martin and Ronnie are still connected. At his home, Barry asked how Joe knew whose blood sample to match and was told that Joe asked Cisco to match the sample with everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry then told Joe to not worry as he was sure Wells had nothing to do with his mother's murder. After Martin was captured, the team track him down and Barry, along with Ronnie go to rescue Martin. Barry was hit with a weaponized phosphorous and began running in circles to burn it off. After Eiling had the upper hand, he prepared to kill Firestorm though Barry stopped Eiling in time and Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs with Firestorm. Later, Barry told Joe that when the time came, he wouldn't fail like he believed he had in the past and he would save his mother.[48]\n\nAfter Barry loses a USB drive containing information on various crime scenes and searches for it at S.T.A.R. Labs with little success, but his attention was quickly diverted when Cisco told him of a possible metahuman, Mari McCabe whom Cisco nicknames \"Vixen\". However Cisco also informs Barry that Mari was currently living in Detroit and not knowing what to expect Barry went to Oliver for help and the two headed to Detroit to confirm whether or not she is a threat. Flash and Arrow arrived at the house of Mari's foster father Chuck but when she saw the vigilantes she immediately ran and they gave chase. Flash gave chase to Mari whose speed was just as fast as his and asked her to stop but she refused and displayed incredible strength caused Flash to fly back several blocks, but eventually resumed the chase with Arrow. Mari then displayed the ability to run up a building forcing Flash and Arrow to take the fight to the rooftops. Despite the combined efforts Mari continued to outrun Flash and dodge Arrow's shots, even crushing his arrows with her bare hands.\n\nMari also displayed the ability to camouflage but Arrow attempted to restrain her with a jettisoning arrow but she outran it, only to slip off the side of the building but then displayed the ability of flight which highly impressed Flash. As Mari attempted to fly away Arrow convinced her to come back as they just wanted to talk, though Flash wanted to handle the talking claiming to be better at it but Arrow simply reminded him he just puts meta-humans in the pipeline. However Mari shot down Flash and Arrow's claim that she was a meta-human claiming that she wasn't in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded, which Felicity was able to confirm. Though Flash was unconvinced Arrow offered their help to Mari to understand what she can do but she turned them down as she was uninterested and warned them that if they ever showed up at Chuck's house again, she'd kill them and flew off.[49]\n\nIgnoring Mari's warning Flash and Arrow returned later to her house, where they discovered she'd become a vigilante herself, and Arrow questioned her intentions to take on Detroit's criminals without training. However Mari convinced them to let her try things her way for a while and Arrow agreed and wished her luck as Flash reminded her they could still help if she needed them to. After Mari asked if they had an idea of a name for her Flash told her that Cisco had been calling her Vixen, and he quickly tried to cover up mentioning Cisco causing Arrow to ask if Barry and Felicity were separated at birth. Arrow also learned that Flash kissed her causing him to speed off in worry.[50]\n\nBarry took Linda bowling where they bumped into Iris and Eddie. The two join them but later, Eddie and Barry were called after a silent alarm went off at the Central City Morgue. Barry ran ahead and investigated the crime scene prior to returning as his CSI job and on his way, he noticed another Flash running beside him. After listening to a recording, they learned that it was Mark Mardon who attacked the Morgue. The following day, while Barry and Joe were discussing over a drive, they were attacked by Mark Mardon, though Barry got Joe to safety in time. Barry and Iris later went to CC Jitters where the latter told Barry that she suspects Wells had to do with Stagg's murder. Barry told Iris that Wells is a great man and she won't find such a story. Barry later told Cisco and Caitlin from what he heard from Iris but still denied the fact that Wells had involvement in Stagg's disappearance. After Mark attacked the precinct, Barry ran over in time to stop Mardon with the Wizard's Wand, though Mark escaped. The following day, Barry dropped by and conversed with Mason Bridge about Harrison Wells.\n\nBarry asked Mason what evidence he had on Wells and was told to read about it like everyone else. After Joe was kidnapped and held hostage by Mark Mardon, the latter called Iris to meet him at the waterfront. Barry went to help Iris. Linda stopped by the precinct to talk to Barry, though Barry told Linda there was something more important, though not what she thought was going on. At the waterfront, realizing the danger, Barry told Iris to get out and get to safety, though Iris confessed her love for Barry. The two share a kiss before Barry revealed his alter-ego to Iris. To stop Mark Mardon's wave from destroying the city, Barry ran back and forth the seawall to create a barrier of wind and doing so, he accidentally traveled back in time as he watched his past self run towards the morgue.[25]\n\nAt the morgue, Barry was confused at what was going on, quickly solving everything. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry finished off everyone's sentences and Wells quickly realized that Barry had traveled back in time. Wells then warned Barry to not alter any events, big or small as it could cause a cataclysm. Ignoring Wells instructions, Barry tracked down Mark Mardon and brought him to the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator prison. Wells told Barry that even though he may have saved many lives, time would find a way to repair itself. Barry ran as fast as he did previously in an attempt to go back once again, though to no success. At Central City Picture News, Linda told Barry that she knows he still had feelings for Iris and broke up with him, though wished him luck with Iris. Barry then told Mason he knew he suspected something wrong with Wells. Later that night, Barry and Cisco grab a drink but Barry ended up leaving Cisco with Lisa, unknown to him who she really is. The following day, Barry confessed his feelings to Iris, though to his surprise, she didn't feel the same way.\n\nAfter a report of Snart and the Santini crime family casino, Barry rushed over and held Lisa hostage. Snart told Barry to let her go as he told Barry he has Cisco hostage. After the two left, Barry returned to the labs as a CSI where he was punched by Eddie for trying to win Iris over earlier. The following day, Cisco showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs and quit, feeling guilt for revealing Barry's identity. Barry told Cisco that he shouldn't feel sorry but Cisco still felt the guilt. Barry and Caitlin later realize the casino wasn't the target but a way to trigger a money transfer. Barry chased after Leonard, Lisa, and Mick and captured Leonard. Barry told Leonard he could lock him up for good but Leonard told him then there would be no way of stopping his broadcast of him revealing Barry's identity. Barry told Leonard that if he was good as he claimed he is, he shouldn't need to kill. Barry then told Leonard if he hurt anyone close to him, he would go after him, no matter who Leonard told his secret to. At Jitters, Eddie apologized to Barry for hitting him and learned that Caitlin told Iris and Eddie about his \"lightning psychosis\". Barry later went to ask Wells about Stagg but before he could ask, he saw a report of Mason Bridge missing. He later called Joe and admitted that he was right about Wells.[51]\n\nDiscovering Wells' true identity\n\nBarry and Joe discuss over Wells and while Barry believed he could be the Reverse-Flash, Joe told Barry that the blood at the house didn't match his. Barry then rushed over to a terrorist attack by Axel Walker, who claimed himself as the Trickster. They learn that Axel is a copycat of James Jesse, who had killed 10 civilians and 2 cops prior and now facing life sentences at Iron Heights. Barry and Joe head over to Iron Heights where James Jesse told them Axel likely found his lair. On their way out, Barry stopped by his father's cell and told him he has gotten closer than he had before in investigating his mother's murder. Iris later called the Flash to ask for help for the investigation on Mason Bridge's disappearance. Axel then made an address that he had planted a bomb somewhere in Central City. When Barry couldn't find the bomb, Wells told him it was a trick but Barry thinks that there is another way. As Barry kept looking, Wells theory was indeed correct as Axel broke James Jesse out and took Henry Allen hostage.\n\nUpset his father is held hostage and possibly killed, Joe was comforted by Barry and while the latter no longer trusted Wells, Joe told Barry it didn't matter why Wells was helping and the only thing that mattered was that he did. After they tracked down the Tricksters, Barry ran over but Axel planted a kinetic bomb so if Barry didn't run over 600 mph, the bomb would go off. Barry was told by Wells to phase through a wall but Barry says that he can't. Wells told Barry to feel the power and electricity and that he was now part of a speed force. Barry ran through a truck, getting the kinetic bomb off and returned to City Hall to give everyone an antidote. Barry then went to rescue his father before knives could drop on him. Barry then confirmed his father's prediction that he is indeed the Flash. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Henry thanked Wells for taking care of Barry, though Barry didn't seem to happy. The two share a hug before Henry was brought back to Iron Heights. At the precinct, Barry revealed his identity to Eddie and told Eddie to get Iris to stop looking in on Mason Bridge. Barry then described Wells' speech and deduced that he is indeed the Reverse-Flash.[29]\n\nBarry, Eddie, and Joe quickly took down a group of robbers and apprehended them. The following day, they went to Hudson University where Lindsay Kang was stung to death. Barry brought a sample back to S.T.A.R. Labs and they were soon joined by Felicity and Ray Palmer, though Barry told Felicity it wasn't the best time for a visit. At Jitters, Barry and Felicity were interrupted by Eddie and the three ended up making dinner plans between Eddie, Felicity, Barry, Ray, and Iris. Soon after, Bill Carlisle was attacked at Folston Tech but Barry was too late by the time he got there. He was then attacked by Brie Larvan's bee's and went unconscious. With a defibrillator Cisco built in, the team regained Barry's consciousness. Later that night at the dinner, Barry informed Felicity who Wells really is after Ray discussed how Wells was his personal hero.\n\nAfter things at dinner went downhill with Eddie and Iris, Barry was called back to S.T.A.R. Labs where they learned the bee's were all robotic. At Jitters, Felicity told Barry to inform Caitlin and Cisco about Wells, though Barry told Felicity it could backfire. Barry later told Iris to trust Eddie and that Eddie only wants to keep her in the light. The team later learned Brie went to her next target, Tina McGee and Barry went to Brie's hideout while Ray went to save Tina. Brie sent bee's to attack Barry but Felicity hacked into the software and shut the bee's down and restrained Brie. Barry rushed over to Cisco after he was stung by a bee and vibrated his hand to use as a defibrillator.\n\nAfter Tina thanked Barry for the help, Barry asked what happened between her and Wells and learned one day Wells became a completely different person. Barry later called Caitlin and Cisco over and told them about why he and Joe had learned about Wells. When Caitlin was hesitant to believe them, Cisco told them he has had dreams of Wells murdering him.[52]\n\nBarry ran over to Coast City and returned to Central City with pizza. At Joe's house, they inform the rest of the team that Joe and Cisco are headed to Starling City to investigate Wells. Later, Eddie called Barry when there was a report of a male who was trying to sell jewelry which was stolen the night before. Barry rushed over but learned the man was a shape-shifting meta-human. When the team feared the meta-human could copy Barry's powers, they told him to keep his hands off him. When Caitlin went to Wells' mansion, Barry rushed over and took her away and told her not to tell Wells anything. Eddie and Barry went to contact Mrs. Bates though soon realize it was actually Hannibal Bates. After Hannibal framed Eddie, Barry ran Eddie out of the precinct and told him S.T.A.R. Labs could keep him off the grid until they cleared his name but Eddie told him to do it the right way and Barry returned him to the precinct. Barry later got a visit from Eddie and was told Captain Singh called in a favor.\n\nAs Barry turned his back, Eddie, who actually was Hannibal, hit Barry and hid him. Barry was later found by Caitlin and they return to S.T.A.R. Labs. Caitlin presented Barry with a serum which could disable his shape-shifting abilities. They then got a ping from Barry's phone at the airport and Barry ran over. Barry quickly spotted Hannibal and the two quickly fought before Hannibal was shot with the serum. Barry later gave DA Cecile a full list of everyone Hannibal had impersonated. Later, Joe and Cisco presented with their discovery in Starling City, the corpse of the real Harrison Wells. Upon seeing this Barry realized that Tina's words about Wells being a different person were true as the \"Wells\" they knew was an impostor. While Cisco was looking through the schematics of S.T.A.R. Labs, they spotted a hidden room. As they entered the room, they saw the Reverse-Flash suit as well as an article from 2024 reporting the disappearance of the Flash.[53]\n\nThey realized that \"Wells\" was from the future. Barry, Caitlin and Cisco were then greeted by Gideon who told Barry of his future. Barry, hoping to get some information out of it asked why Wells came to this timeline. Gideon revealed the grim, cold-hard truth; he came here to kill Barry. When they learn Wells was on his way, Barry quickly asked why he killed Nora Allen that night, where Gideon revealed that he did so out of anger after Barry escaped from him. When Wells was heading to the Time Vault, they quickly left. The team then help Cisco see his \"dream\" properly by constructing glasses that allowed lucid dreaming. At the precinct, Eddie asked Barry to ask Joe why he did not give his blessing for his proposal to Iris. Later, while Cisco was in his lucid dream, the team learned Wells' true identity, Eobard Thawne, who called them shortly after Cisco woke up. Eobard told him of a fire that just broke out and Barry rushed over. When Barry was unsure what to do, Eobard guided him to use his arms like a vacuum by rotating them fast enough.\n\nLater, Eobard told Barry that the only thing stopping him from achieving his goals, 9s himself. Barry later told Joe that they need to recreate the events that happened in Cisco's dream. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco had rigged the force field so instead of keeping a speedster in, it kept them out, which Barry had tested. Later, when Eobard returned from his lecture, Eobard managed to enter the force-field. As he prepared to kill Cisco, Joe fired three bullets at him, though Barry stopped most of them. The final one Barry was unable to reach and Eobard was shot and killed. Barry was upset that Eobard would never be able to confess however, it turned out to be Hannibal Bates.\n\nThey were then reminded by Eobard that he was always one step ahead. Barry told Eobard he could kill him if he'd just let his father out but Eobard told Barry he needed Barry alive. Cisco got a ping from Eobard's time vault and Barry ran over. Barry learned Eobard had camera's everywhere and had access to CCTV footage. Barry warned the team before running over to save Eddie and Iris. Eobard captured Eddie as Barry arrived. Barry told Iris everything was going to be ok and swore that he would bring Eddie home. As he ran off, Barry sent a static shock, much like he had when he was in a coma as Iris realized who the Flash really is.[39]\n\nBarry looked everywhere for Eddie but to no success. When Captain Singh asked where Eddie was, Barry and Joe told Eddie was taking personal time off. When the gold reserve was being attacked by Grodd, who had controlled Eiling, Barry ran over but was quickly stopped as Grodd \"whammied\" both Eiling and Barry. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, the team was greeted by Iris, much to the team's shock. Barry explained to Iris that there had been many times he wanted to tell Iris his secret but learned that Joe was right.\n\nBarry and the CCPD later set a trap and capture Eiling. They locked him in the meta-human prison and learn he was controlled by Grodd. With the help of Iris, they learn of sewer workers going missing and Barry, Joe, and Cisco headed down to look for Grodd. Barry was whammied and knocked unconscious and Joe was kidnapped by Grodd. Later, Barry had Cisco build a tech so Grodd couldn't get into his head again. When Iris told Barry that he had been lying to her on the things that mattered most, Barry told Iris she had been lying about her feelings for him also. Barry cut himself off when he realized he couldn't have told Iris about the other timeline. Barry went 5.3 miles away from Grodd and ran toward him in an attempt for a super-sonic punch, though he had failed as Grodd cut his distance down.\n\nGrodd threw Barry on a train track and as Barry's tech broke, Grodd had gotten into Barry's mind once again. As a train went toward Barry, Iris told Barry that he could defeat Grodd and save Joe. Inspired by Iris' words, Barry got out of the tracks on time and as the train passed, challenged Grodd. As Grodd jumped toward him, Barry got out of the way and another train passed and hit Grodd. Barry saved Joe and freed Eiling from the meta-human prison. Barry later told Iris that it's the thought of her that always kept him going. Iris then told Barry that she did have feelings for Barry but Eddie is her boyfriend and missing. Barry then told Iris that he would do the best he could to bring him back.[54]\n\nAfter continuously searching, Barry told Iris he has yet to still find Eddie but promised he was trying his best. Barry was then called by Cisco who had learned Eobard had been using his wheelchair to absorb Barry's speed. When they learned the particle accelerator was turned on, they realize the reason they couldn't find Eddie and Eobard was because Eobard was holding Eddie hostage at S.T.A.R. Labs. When they opened the particle accelerator, Eobard escaped and Barry chased after him, though Eobard had gotten away. Later Barry apologized to Eddie for not finding him sooner.\n\nBarry said they needed to get the meta-humans out as even though they are dangerous, they don't deserve to die. Barry suggested they transfer them to the super-max on Lian Yu. Desperate, Barry looked to Leonard Snart to help transfer the meta-humans, under one condition, Barry erase all criminal records of him, though Joe was very disappointed Barry looked to such lengths. They had the meta-humans placed in a truck owned by Cisco's family and used the device from Eobard's wheelchair to disable the meta-humans powers temporarily. Once they reached the hangar, the meta-humans had escaped and began attacking Barry, Cisco, Caitlin, and Joe. They then learned it was Leonard who had sabotaged the truck and let the meta-humans escape. Leonard told Barry he had done so as they all now owe him and could be useful as a part of his Rogues Gallery. When Barry asked why he had spared him, Leonard told him he now owes him as well.\n\nAt S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry felt guilt having his plan failed and wondered how Oliver could do whatever it took to get what he needed. The particle accelerator then was fully charged and online. Eobard approached S.T.A.R. Labs and Barry ran out to face him. Eobard told Barry he couldn't stop him if he had tried as Eobard was always faster. Barry was then joined by Firestorm and Oliver. Barry and Eobard faced off as Oliver tried to get a clear shot at Eobard. Barry was thrown towards a S.T.A.R. Labs sign and as Eobard used his hands as a vacuum to blow Firestorm away, Barry ran over to grab Firestorm. Barry ran back and stopped Eobard before he could kill Oliver. Barry and Eobard fought on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs and Eobard was thrown off S.T.A.R. Labs by Firestorm.Eobard was then shot by Oliver with another nanite arrow, disabling Eobard's speed and making him unconscious. Barry thanked Oliver and Firestorm for their help and looked over Eobard, finally taking down the man who murdered his mother.[55] Barry ran off to Nanda Parbat and freed Oliver's friends. When Felicity asked to help save Starling City, Barry said he had a long overdue conversation with Eobard.[56]\n\nBarry asked why Eobard he murdered his mother, Eobard told him he hates him for something future Barry had done. He reveals that killing Nora was not his original intention, as he really went back 15 years to kill Barry when he was still a child. When Barry got his past self to safety, Thawne was so angry that he took it out on Nora by killing her. Eobard then told both of them could get what they want, Barry return to save his mother which would allow Eobard to return to his time. Barry presented this information to the team who all agreed he should do so. Barry asked Joe why he was so supportive and Joe told him though he had been a great son, he wants Barry growing up with his mother and his real father. Barry told his father he could save his mother but Henry told him it was to dangerous due to the repercussions of time travel.\n\nIris told Barry she knew of a possible future of them being married in the future and joked she was never a fan of hyphenated names. Eobard explained how Barry was going to go back to the night his mother was murdered, he warned Barry that he could die if he didn't reach the right velocity. Later, Barry was informed that as well as dying, Barry could cause a singularity which could destroy earth and continue even after the earth is gone. Barry along with the rest of the team attended Ronnie and Caitlin's wedding before Barry prepared to save his mother. Barry said his goodbye's to his friends and foster family. Barry was then told he had 1:52 seconds otherwise a singularity would form. Eobard told Barry he holds both of their futures and then told him to run.\n\nAs Barry ran, he saw the past, present, and future before traveling back to the night his mother was murdered. When Barry arrived to the night, Barry looked on as his future self battled Eobard. His future self then signaled him to stay back and Barry looked away as his future self rescued his younger self and Eobard murdered his mother When Eobard had left, he went and told his mother that he and his father turned out to be ok. His mother looked at him, proud of her son, and Barry tells her goodbye, before she dies in front of him, her last words being \"Goodbye, Barry\".[18]\n\nIn the Flashpoint timeline, Barry, witnessing another future version of himself save his mother, uttered a faint laugh of bewilderment before fading away due to his timeline's resulting erasure.[57] In the post-Flashpoint timeline, this version of Barry was presumably reconstituted in the same moment to witness his mother's death as he did before.[58]\n\nBarry returned and broke Eobard's time machine. Eobard asked why he didn't save his mother and have everything he had wanted and Barry told Eobard he already has. Barry and Eobard battled though Eobard quickly has the upper hand. When Eobard told he was going to kill as his friends and family, Eddie shot himself and Eobard fell back. Cisco quickly realized that Eobard was being erased from existence and before Eobard vanished, Eobard told Barry he controlled his life all his life and wondered how he would go on without him. A singularity formed in the particle accelerator and the team rushed out. As they watched the singularity eat Central City, Barry told the team he had to try and stop it, even with little chance of success. Barry ran through Central City and jumped towards the singularity.[18] As he stabilized the singularity, Firestorm flew toward the singularity and Barry watched as the two separate, causing the singularity to close. As Martin Stein plummeted to the ground, Barry caught him. When Caitlin arrived at their location and learned Ronnie didn't make it, Barry hugged Caitlin and looked toward the sky. For the next six months, Barry lived in solitude, blaming Eddie and Ronnie's deaths on himself.[1]\n\nWar against Zoom\n\nGoing solo\n\nEobard Thawne, as Harrison Wells left S.T.A.R. Labs to Barry in his will, yet six months after the issue with the singularity, Barry had still not dealt with the mail he'd been getting regarding the property.[1]\n\nFlash Day\n\nBarry investigated the crime scene involving the death of Al Rothstein. Barry identified that Rothstein was strangled by someone large, though assured Joe that it wasn't Grodd. That night, Barry cleaned up Jitters from the destruction caused by the singularity. Iris arrived and joked Barry should be a contractor, as she noticed night after night, buildings had been rebuilt. Barry told Iris he wasn't going to his rally, though Iris told him he should just go as the citizens of Central City deserve to see the man who saved the city. Barry then told Iris that he wasn't the man who saved the city. After Iris left, Barry remembered it was Firestorm who closed the singularity, causing the death of Ronnie Raymond. The following day during his rally, Barry decided to show and accept the key to the city, much to the cities joy. As the key was handed over, Atom-Smasher threw a grill toward the mayor, though Barry got the mayor away in time. After Atom-Smasher grew, the Flash picked up and threw two propane tanks for Joe to shoot. After the tanks exploded, Atom-Smasher shrank and his mask unfolded. Barry and Joe noticed that he"
