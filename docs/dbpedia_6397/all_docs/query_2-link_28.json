        "text": "Unlike the focus on unintentional expressions of attitudes that are challenging to regulate, the creation of the IAT was guided by studies on implicit memory. This approach proposed that memories of past experiences could impact responses even when they were inaccessible to introspection (Gawronski et al., 2020). In practice, the IAT gauges the degree of association between a target concept and an attribute dimension by measuring the time it takes for participants to utilize two response keys, each with a dual meaning. The participants' task is to classify stimuli as they appear on the screen, such as categorizing names (e.g., \"Latonya\" or \"Betsy\") as typical of blacks or whites. For example, race is the target concept, and the keys are labeled \"black\" and \"white\" in Greenwald et al.’s (1998) IAT on racial attitudes. Participants then categorize a range of words with clearly valenced meanings (e.g., \"poison\" or \"gift\") as pleasant or unpleasant, which constitutes the attribute dimension.\n\nDuring the critical phase of the study, the two categorization tasks are combined. Participants perform this combined task twice - once with one response key signifying Black/pleasant and the other labeled White/unpleasant, and once with one key indicating Black/unpleasant and the other White/pleasant - in a counterbalanced order. The main question is which response mapping participants find easier to use. In the Greenwald et al. (1998) study, participants were much quicker at responding when Black was paired with unpleasant than when Black was paired with pleasant. On average, participants found it easier to associate the target concept Black with the attribute unpleasant than with the attribute pleasant, which can be interpreted as indication of implicit racial bias.\n\nOver the past decades, at least 20 different instruments (see Table 1) have been developed to measure implicit bias. Among these instruments, the IAT (#11) and the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT; #19) are the most common measures used for the assessment of implicit biases and self-concepts. Most recently the IAT was found to have a higher accuracy of predicting behavioral choices over the SC-IAT, regardless of the scoring procedure (Epifania et al., 2020).\n\nAdditional implicit measures have been developed based on the groundwork laid by the EPT and the IAT. Two noteworthy examples include the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task and the Go/No-Go Association task. The former was developed as an affective variation of the spatial Simon task to measure attitudes implicitly (De Houwer & Eelen, 1998; De Houwer, 2003). During this task, participants must discriminate between the stimuli (e.g., noun/adjective or man-made/natural) by responding \"positive\" for one category and \"negative\" for the other. As the stimuli themselves have varying levels of associated valence, this process produces both evaluatively congruent trials, where the stimulus's valence and its related category signal the same response (e.g., responding \"positive\" to \"flower\" as it is a noun), and evaluatively incongruent trials, where response competition arises (e.g., responding \"negative\" to \"happy\" as it is an adjective). The Go/No-Go Association Task was introduced by Nosek & Banaji (2001). It is a modified version of the IAT that eliminates the need for a contrast category. During the task, participants react to stimuli that symbolize the target and attribute categories as \"good,\" but take no action in response to other stimuli. The time taken to respond, or any errors made, are then compared to a block of trials where participants must respond to items that represent the target category and \"bad.\"\n\nSeveral physiological methods have also been used as implicit measures of implicit bias. These diverse approaches share a common goal: to estimate the construct of interest without requiring a verbal self-report from the participant. The primary advantage of these indirect estimates is that they are less likely to be influenced by social desirability concerns. In many cases, participants may not even be aware that their attitudes, stereotypes, and so on are being measured until after a “debrief” session with the researchers, which is a common strategy used to make sure that accurate results are obtained while preserving the ethical standards of conducting human subjects research that informs participants of their rights and preserves said rights.\n\nThe seminal research in a related field experimented with a variety of physiological measures. Vanman et al. (2004) employed facial electromyography (EMG) to investigate racial prejudice. Both Phelps et al. (2000) and Hart et al. (2000) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study amygdala activation as an indicator of racial evaluation. Eyeblink startle response to Black and White faces has also been used for this purpose (Phelps et al. 2000, Amodio et al. 2003). Cardiovascular reactivity measures, indicating challenge or threat, have been utilized to examine responses to interactions with Black individuals and others who face stigma (Blascovich et al. 2001). Furthermore, Cacioppo and colleagues have applied event-related brain potentials as a real-time measure of categorizing stimuli as positive or negative (e.g., Cacioppo et al. 1993, Crites et al. 1995, Ito & Cacioppo, 2000).\n\nWhile these physical measures can effectively identify involuntary responses to stimuli, they also present challenges to implement, unlike the more broadly accessible online tests. The utilization of psychophysiological measures can demand significant time, infrastructure, and money. Therefore, these strategies may not be readily accessible to all researchers. When selecting an appropriate implicit bias measurement tool, we recommend a careful review of the strengths and drawbacks of each measure, including attention to the target concept of interest (e.g., stereotypes, schema, attitudes) to make informed decisions regarding the most suitable measure for their specific research/training objectives.\n\nResearch on racial attitudes conducted by Fazio and colleagues has identified three distinct types of individuals, characterized by the automatic processes they engage in and their subsequent efforts to counter or control those evaluations (Fazio et al., 1995). The first group consists of individuals who are non-prejudiced; these individuals do not exhibit the activation of negative attitudes towards a particular racial group. The second group encompasses individuals who are genuinely prejudiced, as they experience negative automatic associations but make no attempts to counter or control the expression of those associations. The third group comprises individuals who may experience negative automatic associations, but they are motivated to actively counter such sentiments. Individuals in this last group, who seek to mitigate the role of implicit racial biases in their overt actions or behaviors can pursue intentional actions at either the personal (internal) or the situational (external) level. Each type of influence has been documented to shape the conditions under which implicit racial biases are likely to affect behavior.\n\nPersonal Factor 1: The Role of Motivation\n\nMotivated individuals have the capacity to exert influence over the automatic operation of stereotypes and biases (Blair, 2002). Dunton and Fazio (1997) investigated the influence of motivation on controlling biased reactions and identified two sources of motivation: a concern with appearing prejudiced and a desire to avoid conflicts or disagreements about one's thoughts or positions. Their findings suggested that individuals with low motivation to control biased reactions were more likely to provide accurate self-reports of racial attitudes. Devine et al. (2002) further explored the impact of motivation on implicit and explicit biases, concluding that explicit biases were moderated by internal motivation, while implicit biases were influenced by the interaction of both internal and external motivation.\n\nDevine et al.’s finding is consonant with that of Irene Blair. Blair (2002) identified two individual (internal) level interventions and one situational (external) intervention that can potentially mitigate implicit bias. The internal factors involve examining the manipulations of the perceiver's motivations, goals, and strategies during the process in which implicit bias arises. On the other hand, the external factor identified by Blair focuses on changes in the context surrounding the stimulus or variations in the attributes of group members.\n\nIndividuals who possess high motivation have the ability to influence the automatic activation of stereotypes and bias (Blair, 2002). When an individual’s self-image is threatened, they may automatically activate negative stereotypes in order to enhance their own appearance or discredit someone they dislike (Sinclair & Kunda, 1999; Spencer et al., 1998). Conversely, they can also automatically suppress negative stereotypes and activate positive ones when it benefits their self-image (Sinclair & Kunda, 1999). Automatic stereotypes and bias can be influenced by the social demands of a situation and the nature of one's relationship with others. For example, White individuals may moderate their automatic bias when interacting with a Black person, particularly if they are in a subordinate position (Lowery et al., 2001; Richeson & Ambady, 2001). They may also adjust their automatic stereotypes if those stereotypes conflict with social norms (Sechrist et al., 2001).\n\nThe concept of overcorrection, where individuals compensate for their biases by displaying exaggeratedly positive or negative responses that conceal their true attitudes, has also been investigated. Dunton and Fazio (1997) suggested that highly motivated individuals who aim to control prejudiced reactions might overcompensate for their automatically activated negativity, resulting in more positive judgments than those with activated positivity.\n\nPersonal Factor 2: Promotion of Counter Stereotypes\n\nIt is argued that individuals who perceive stereotypes have the ability to actively foster counter-stereotypic associations. By doing so, they can potentially undermine the influence of implicit stereotypes in the process of information processing. Promotion of counter stereotypes can be achieved through tasks such as priming of counterstereotype expectancy, mental imagery, and exposure to counterstereotypic group members (Blair & Banaji, 1996; Blair et al., 2001; Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001). To examine the effect of counterstereotype expectancy on implicit bias, Irene Blair and Mahzarin Banaji (1996) conducted a sequential priming task, which assesses automatic associations by measuring how a briefly presented stimulus (prime) influences the response time to a subsequent stimulus (target). Half of the participants were instructed to anticipate prime-target trials that aligned with stereotypes, while the other half were informed to expect counterstereotypic trials. However, in reality, all participants experienced both stereotypic and counterstereotypic trials, with the anticipated trial type appearing only 63% of the time. The results of this study revealed that the counterstereotype expectancy significantly lowered levels of automatic stereotypes than the stereotype expectancy.\n\nThe effect of mental imagery was examined through tests targeting implicit gender stereotypes. Blair and colleagues (2001) instructed the participants to spend around 5 minutes to create a mental image of a strong woman, which is counterstereotypic to the traditional stereotype, and then complete an automatic gender stereotype test. Participants who engaged in the counterstereotypic mental imagery exhibited substantially weaker automatic stereotypes compared to participants in the control groups, which included those who attempted to suppress their stereotypes on their own.\n\nThe exposure-to-counterstereotypic-group-members mitigation strategy takes a somewhat different approach. A group of participants were exposed to either a) admired African Americans and disliked White Americans, b) disliked African Americans and admired White Americans, or c) nonracial control stimuli. Following the exposure, the participants took IAT automatic racial bias measures both immediately and 24 hours later (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001). The study found that exposure to positive Black group members reduced automatic bias against Blacks compared to exposure to negative group members or to control stimuli. It is also worth noting that this effect continued to be significant after 24 hours. While Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001) believe that this effect is likely to diminish after an extended hiatus, these findings remain significant as they challenge the assumption that automatic racial attitudes, ingrained through long-term socialization, are unchangeable.\n\nOne potential concern the researchers emphasized about their results regards the possibility that when individuals are exposed to strongly positive and negative exemplars of a particular stereotype, they might categorize these exemplars as “exceptions to the rule” and adjust their attitudinal response accordingly before expressing it. This observation aligns with studies on stereotypic belief revisions, which demonstrate that when confronted with evidence, explicitly held stereotypes can remain firm if the new evidence or exemplars are perceived as atypical (Bodenhausen et al., 1995; Kunda & Oleson, 1995; Rothbart & John, 1985; Weber & Crocker, 1983). As such, instead of revising the original stereotype, new cognitive categories are created to accommodate these counterstereotypic exemplars, a phenomenon known as subtyping. However, Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001) contend that this effect is less likely to manifest when individuals do not have ample cognitive resources to reflect on and recategorize these counterstereotypic exemplars. This perspective is supported by the findings of Dasgupta and Greenwald’s study, where exposure to counterstereotypes reduced implicit, but not explicit, stereotypes against Black individuals. The researchers therefore cautioned that care must be taken to ensure that this type of exposure doesn't label the counterstereotypic exemplars as mere exceptions, which would inadvertently perpetuate the original stereotype.\n\nPersonal Factor 3: Group Membership and Identity\n\nPerceptions of group membership and identity are another personal factor that can influence one’s implicit bias. Categories such as race, gender, and age can be perceived almost instantaneously (Cikara & Van Bavel, 2014; Ito & Bartholow, 2009). Ingroups, whether they exist in real life or are artificially created for an experiment, can result in attitudes and behaviors of favoritism (Pinter & Greenwald, 2011; vanKnippenberg & Amodio, 2014). Simon and Gutsell (2020) interrogated this phenomenon utilizing the minimal group paradigm developed by Tajfel, Billig, Bundy and Flament (1971). This paradigm allows researchers to create experimental social categories that participants have never encountered before, enabling control over individual experiences, motives, and opinions. Participants in this study were evenly assigned to two minimal groups with arbitrarily created racial names. Researchers found that knowledge of arbitrary group membership led participants to humanize and show implicit bias favoring their ingroup members of the minimal group, despite the cross-cutting presence of race. This finding demonstrates that even within minimal groups, the consequences of implicit racial bias can be overcome through recategorization.\n\nTo further comprehend the underlying dynamics of this effect, Fritzlen and colleagues (2020) conducted two studies exploring the boundary conditions of the reclassification effort. They first examined whether learning of an identity-implying similarity with an outgroup could influence once’s implicit bias towards that outgroup. One of the identity-implying similarities they used in the study was genetic overlap with an outgroup. Their first study found that White participants who were made to believe that they had greater than average genetic overlap with African Americans showed decreases in implicit bias against that racial group. In a follow-up study, the researchers explored whether this effect holds in the context of sexual orientation identity. In this study, heterosexual participants were led to believe that they exhibited same-sex attraction and their implicit bias against homosexual individuals were measured. The findings showed that heterosexual participants’ implicit biases against homosexual individuals were reduced only if respondents believed that sexual orientation was biologically determined. Thus, Fritzlen and colleagues (2020) concluded that learning of an identity-implying similarity with an outgroup can reduce implicit bias if that group membership is perceived as immutable.\n\nThese findings hint at a broader implication that aligns with the intergroup contact theory, which suggests that direct contact between members of different social or cultural groups can be effective in reducing prejudice and conflicts between groups (e.g., Allport & Kramer, 1946; Lee & Humphrey, 1968; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). For instance, Kephart (1957) found that White police officers in who had worked with Black colleagues differed substantially from other White policemen on the force. They had fewer objections to teaming with a Black partner and taking orders from qualified Black officers. Combined with the evidence for minimal group reclassification effect on implicit bias (Frizlen et al., 2020), this suggests that enhancing awareness of shared group membership or identities, even arbitrary ones, could serve as a strategic approach to fostering positive intergroup relations and reducing implicit biases.\n\nFurthermore, having positive intergroup contact has been shown to have potential positive influence over implicit bias as well in both virtual and real-life settings. Early behavioral studies found that people are better at recognizing faces from their own race compared to faces from other racial targets (Meissner & Brigham, 2001), a phenomenon dubbed as “the own race bias.” Following this line of research, Farmer and colleagues (2020) investigated whether positive intergroup contact can moderate the implicit bias in face perception using fMRI. In their study, White participants with a varied range of contact experiences with Blacks were first selected through a pre-task questionnaire. During the fMRI scan the selected participants completed an individuation task (favorite vegetables) and a social categorization task (above or under 25 years old) while viewing the faces of both Black and White strangers. The fMRI results showed that more frequent positive contact with Black individuals increased activation for Black faces in the social categorization task. This finding shows that quality of intergroup contact is also a key factor in processing out-group faces and reducing the own-race face bias. Improving the quality of intergroup contact is something individuals who are motivated to mitigate their biases have control over in their personal lives.\n\nContextual Factor 1: Configuration of the Cues\n\nOne important area for mitigation efforts focuses on how individuals interpret cues provided to them. Two types of studies have ensued: impression formation and perspective taking. In the classic impression formation studies conducted by Asch (1946), participants were given the task of forming impressions of an individual based on a set of traits such as skillfulness, industriousness, and intelligence. The presence of the trait \"warm\" or \"cold\" on the list had a significant impact on the impressions formed by the participants, leading to notable differences in their evaluations. Researchers argued that such fluidity in meaning may also be observed in automatic processes such as implicit stereotypes and biases (Blair, 2002). For instance, Macrae et al. (1995) conducted a study that highlighted how even a slight contextual change can exert a notable influence on automatic stereotypes. In their experiments, all participants were exposed to a Chinese woman, and subsequent measurements of automatic stereotypes toward both Chinese individuals and women were taken using a lexical decision task. In one condition, the Chinese woman was observed applying makeup, while in another condition, she was seen using chopsticks. As hypothesized, Macrae et al. discovered that participants who witnessed the woman applying makeup exhibited faster responses to traits stereotypically associated with women and slower responses to traits stereotypically associated with Chinese individuals. Conversely, participants who observed her using chopsticks displayed the opposite pattern of responses. Despite the stimulus remaining the same, a minor alteration in the context resulted in a substantial change in the automatic stereotypes evoked by her presence. Similarly, the automatic attitudes triggered by the presence of the same Black individual can vary depending on the setting (Wittenbrink et al., 2001). For example, when a person is encountered on a city street, different automatic attitudes may emerge compared to when they are encountered inside a church. In general, city streets are often associated with more negative perceptions compared to the interior of a church, and similarly, Black faces tend to be perceived more negatively than White faces. It is important to note, however, that these qualities do not independently impact the automatic process. Instead, their effects are multiplicative, meaning that when a Black face is encountered in a city street context, the automatic negativity becomes particularly strong.\n\nAn individual’s capacity to take perspectives and to show empathic concerns are also significant predictors of their implicit bias (Patané et al., 2020). Researchers have theorized that bilingualism may enhance perspective-taking at early developmental stages, thus reducing the expression of social bias. Being raised with more than one native language is often considered an advantage as it diversifies the range of linguistic, social, and cultural experiences available to an individual (Singh et al., 2020). Singh and colleagues compared monolingual and bilingual children to examine whether bilingual individuals are as susceptible to racial bias as their monolingual counterparts. Results showed that bilingual individuals displayed less implicit bias against Blacks. Additionally, it is possible that bilingualism predisposes individuals to more frequent social encounters with outgroups (something we discussed in association with personal factor #2), which may also reduce implicit bias against members of an outgroup.\n\nKang and Falk (2020) explored perspective-taking via an fMRI study to investigate the relationship between individuals’ tendencies to engage brain regions that support perspective-taking and their implicit biases towards a stigmatized group. Their findings revealed that an intervention task that exercised one’s ability to make inferences about others’ mental states was able to reduce implicit bias. Therefore, the researchers argued that intervention strategies designed to enhance social cognitive processing could be effective in reducing people’s implicit biases against stigmatized individuals. Patané and colleagues explored a related perspective-taking question using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology to explore whether interventions tailored to increase perpective-taking can help to reduce implicit racial bias and the use of VR technology to design interventions to reduce implicit racial bias. The researchers had a group of White study participants embody a Black virtual body. They compared those who engaged in a cooperative activity with another Black avatar to those who engaged in a neutral activity. The results revealed that those who engaged in a cooperative activity with a Black avatar had lower IAT scores after the social interaction than those who engaged in a neutral activity with a Black avatar.\n\nCollectively, these findings indicate that automatic perception relies on the configuration of various stimulus cues, and even small changes can lead to remarkably different outcomes. It highlights the sensitivity of automatic processes to contextual factors and the potential for subtle modifications to have a profound impact on perception (Blair, 2002).\n\nContextual Factor #2: Time\n\nAllport, G.
