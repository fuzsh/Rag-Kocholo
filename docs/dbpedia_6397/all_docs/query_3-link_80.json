His mother wiped her eyes in the front row.\n\nA life sentence without a chance of parole for 25 years is automatic for planned or premeditated murders. Nguyen received four life sentences to be served concurrently.\n\nIn November, Gropper found Nguyen guilty of first-degree murder of rival gangster Randy Kang in Surrey on Oct. 27, 2017, and of Jagvir Singh Malhi, an unintentional target, on Nov. 12, 2018, in Abbotsford. He was also found guilty of attempted murder of Gary Kang, Randy’s brother, and associate Camilo Alonso, both on the night of Kang’s murder.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Crown prosecutor Joe Bellows read in court two victim statements, one from the parents of Malhi, a university student who was shot after being rear-ended by another vehicle.\n\nCourt was told his brother had been the intended victim.\n\nMalhi’s parents said their son was a compassionate and caring young man who visited his ailing grandfather every day, was loved by his community and is still mourned by his dog. They said he was working part-time, taking real estate courses and attending university, with the goal of becoming a police officer and joining the anti-gang task force.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“That opportunity to live that life was stolen from him and our chance to watch him live that life was stolen from us,” they said. “All we have is our memories.”\n\nThe second victim statement was from a bystander who was among the first to try to help Malhi after he was shot. A recently passed Canadian victim bill of rights allows anyone who suffers physically or emotionally from a crime to submit a victim statement, Bellows said.\n\nThe witness, identified as N. Lalli in court documents, said in her statement that her life changed drastically that day because of post-traumatic stress, chronic fatigue, sleep problems and fear of leaving the house alone she still suffers.\n\nShe said she was terrified to go near the body but the 911 operator was asking her to check if Malhi was still breathing.\n\n“I felt so out of control,” she said. “I couldn’t help the situation and that haunts me to this day.”\n\nShe said she dropped out of school and was without a place to live because she was so “mentally distraught” by the trauma. “It left me broken. I felt like I wasn’t safe anywhere.”\n\nBellows told court that Nguyens admitted to the crimes while writing on a white board at an Edmonton apartment in 2019. Nguyen thought he was talking cryptically to a close friend and drug trade associate, when in reality his friend had gone to the police, and police were secretly filming their exchange.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat friend, identified only as AB due to a publication ban, was the Crown’s most important witness. He testified he had worked in the drug trade with Nguyen for years and the accused admitted his role in both murders during conversations that included some hand signals and gestures. AB said he later agreed to become a police agent because he wanted out of the gang lifestyle and had begun to fear Nguyen and other Brothers Keepers.\n\nAB testified Nguyen told him he was paid $100,000 for the Kang murder and $30,000 for the second hit in which Malhi was mistakenly killed.\n\nBefore the hearing on Thursday, Bellows read into court Nguyen’s criminal record. It was for an assault in 2022 while he was in custody awaiting trial, when he punched a corrections officer, breaking his nose.\n\nkbolan@postmedia.com\n\nslazaruk@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBrothers Keepers gangster Tyrel Nguyen found guilty of two B.C. murders\n\nUnited Nations gangster Conor D'Monte ordered extradited to face murder charge\n\nU.S. case summary provides little evidence against B.C.
