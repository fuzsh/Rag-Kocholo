The Editor of the Simriti Granth, Bhai Jaitegh Singh Anant gave a speech on his vision for the creation and purpose of the Granth.

All of the speeches and articles were so eloquently spoken and read.\n\nVarious scholars and historians have written on many aspects of Bhai Sahib’s life, from his spirituality to his role as a Sant Sipahi (Warrior Saint). These qualities were beautifully presented.\n\nPast president of Ross Street Gurdwara, Vancouver Daljit Singh Sandhu, and Jagtar Singh Sandhu of Dashmesh Darbar, Surrey spoke about Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh’s life and the many sacrifices for the Khalsa Panth. They also mentioned that Bhai Sahib should not only be known as the creator of one Organisation, but a great leader of the Sikh Panth.\n\nGiani Narinder Singh of Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Society and Piara Singh Nat (past President of Guru Nanak Sikh Temple) felt that Smagams like these should be held every year, and the Literary Society should be helped in setting up and funding of these projects in the near future as well.\n\nChief Spokesperson Gian Singh Sandhu said that the Simriti Granth would change peoples’ lives morally and spiritually, and that the seed of faith is ingrained in all of humanity. Master Ujagar Singh Khalsa first met Bhai Sahib in 1947, and spoke of his unforgettable memories of times he shared in the sangat of Bhai Sahib. Bhai Malkiat Singh from Seattle, USA also spoke humbly with love about Bhai Sahib.\n\nSimriti Granth was first released by Gian Singh Sandhu after then the first copy of the “Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhir Singh Ji Simriti Granth” was presented by the Editor Bhai Jaiteg Singh Anant to Hononary Scholar Dr. Davinder Singh.

They were also given a copy of the Simriti Granth, and honoured with a dastar, shawal, plack, portrait of Bhai Sahib and citation with a bouquet of flowers.\n\nFinally, Gian Singh Sandhu was presented with a shawal and dastar. Bhai Malkiat Singh was presented with a copy of the Simriti Granth. The smagam ceremony went on for 3 hours in memory of Bhai Sahib.
