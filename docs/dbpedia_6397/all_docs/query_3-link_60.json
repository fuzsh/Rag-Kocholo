        "text": "Letters of Helena Roerich\n\nVolume II: 1935-1939\n\nFrom the Publisher (1967)\n\nThe original edition of this book was published in Russian in 1940 by the Latvian Roerich Society in Riga.\n\nThe publishers express their sincere appreciation to Mme. V. L. Dutko for her fine work in rendering the first English translation. We also take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to all those members of the Agni Society whose assistance and untiring work have made the publication of this book possible.\n\nAgni Yoga Society is honored to present the Letters of Helena Roerich, Volume II as an integral part of The Teaching of Living Ethics.\n\n4\n\n1\n\nI read with deep emotion your letter with the description of the solemn day on which the Society was opened. Thus was inaugurated one more beautiful movement as a bulwark against warring darkness. I know how much of your heart’s aspiration and self-sacrificing work went into the foundation of this pure nucleus of Light in the name of victorious culture! You are therefore the first to receive my ardent greetings and the joy of my spirit at this beautiful celebration of your achievements. Please give my heartiest greetings and best wishes to the Administration and all the founding members of the Society, who worked for this benevolent goal. May this stronghold grow in strength, and may it courageously, luminously, and joyously utilize its forces on the path of service for the General Good.\n\nI was also touched by your reaction to the lofty idea of the Banner of Peace, and I would therefore like to ask if you would consider establishing within your Society a permanent committee for the promotion of the Pact and Banner of Peace? It should be possible to unite those groups already existing, thus achieving solidarity and accord in actions. Think it over.\n\nI find your precautions for guarding the Society against the penetration of undesirable members extremely useful. It is indeed important to guard against the harmful element from the very beginning. Do not attempt to enlarge your activities too much. Primarily, the nucleus of the Society should be worked out and brought into harmony. Large numbers were never a guarantee of success.\n\nI understand your complete joy in associating with flaming hearts. I knew and still know such joy. However, years of experience have taught me to be more reserved and not to trust impulses too easily, and especially of those who have just approached the Teaching. In the beginning, we all march like burning torches; but later, under the action of the unfailing occult laws, our true nature begins to reveal itself more rapidly, and certain characteristics, that we did not even suspect we had, come to the surface, qualities which otherwise perhaps would have remained unrevealed until the next incarnation. The Great Teacher says in The Mahatma Letters, “As the water develops the heat of caustic lime so does the teaching bring into fierce action every unsuspected potentiality latent in him [the aspirant].”\n\nAnd now regarding your questions: One must bear in mind that during the whole expanse of their lives all the Great Teachers, and Mahatmas, or the White Brothers, were Bodhisattvas. Maha-Chohan, or Great Lord, is the title of the Lord of Shambhala. The duties connected with this appointment are undertaken alternately by the White Brothers, according to their individual tasks. The Seven Chohans correspond to the Seven Kumaras of The Secret Doctrine, but esoterically there are eight of them. All these Seven Kumaras were the Lords of Fire, who endowed humanity with Mind.\n\nAs for the brothers of darkness, these are certainly encountered within humanity itself. They are very numerous, and no wonder, for their path is the path of gratification of the base passions. The percentage of true workers of Light is very small; likewise, the percentage of “fireflies” is not large, the more so in that their ignorance and lukewarmness, or non-resistance to evil, work for the benefit of the brothers of darkness. It is difficult to imagine how skillful are the spirits of high degree among the brothers of darkness who consciously work for disunity. It is said that they love to use those who approach the Teaching of Light and who attach themselves to communities established for the Common Good, yet are not firm in devotion and convictions. Playing upon their waverings and by instilling doubt, they are able to bring on confusion and deterioration. That is why caution is advised with the new untested souls when they approach the Teaching. The brothers of darkness are very fond of brilliant intellects developed at the expense of heart, for through them they can act most subtly. Indeed, only the crudest spirits attack and make use of low consciousnesses. “If humans are threatened by devils, the Archangel is accosted by Satan himself! If small devils bother brothers—Satan himself besets hermits.” And as it is said in the first volume of Leaves of Morya’s Garden: “I know thee who scratches at the door. Thou hopest upon the shoulders of a guest to enter My House. I know thee. Thou hast become subtle and resourceful, even more resourceful than many of Mine. Thou has fastened thy clasps and prepared thy garments. Thou hast even studied all My expressions. [Emphases added] I hear thee pronounce even JOY. But here I shall stop thee. Thou dost not dare pronounce the joy of Love. Thy joy is the joy of hatred. But behind hatred is hovering the loathsome shadow of doubt. And doubt is not worthy of a shield. I will receive thy arrows in My Shield. But if thou wilt persist. I will send thee with a smile—but one.” Thus, let us protect ourselves from all those who waver.\n\nYou ask when the brothers of darkness came into existence. Strictly speaking, they came at the same time as the Brothers of Light, from the moment that there appeared a spark of intelligence and of conscious, that is, free, will in man. With the first glimpse of discrimination comes the first concept of good and evil, and the already conscious will directs man hither or thither. But an entirely organized camp of the brothers of darkness began to function in Atlantis, during the Fourth Race. Their great battle with the Sons of Wisdom, or Light, ended in victory for the latter and in the destruction of Atlantis.\n\nAt the head of the Sons of Light stands the Archangel Michael. His adversary in the camp of darkness is Satan (who still bears the name, Lucifer, although he lost the right to this name long ago); at one time he was amongst the great Kumaras, who bestowed the light of Mind upon the poor Earth-dwellers, who lacked it. In connection with this, read the legend about Lucifer in On Eastern Crossroads [On Eastern Crossroads, Legends and Prophecies of Asia, (New York, Frederick A. Stokes company, 1930).]. This legend is based on a great Truth. Thus, the Prince of the World is now fighting for his very existence. The predicted great Armageddon of our race is in full swing. And again the Archangel Michael, with his resplendent host, is fighting against Lucifer. Of course, victory is always with the Forces of Light, but dreadful cataclysms are unavoidable. That is why the strongholds of Light are so essential-during the approaching threatening time they can give shelter to all the Forces of Light. Although the decisive moment is behind you there is still time for many children to grow old. Thus the destiny of the world is in the hands of humanity. The planet can be saved only if there is a resurrection of the spirit, only if the consciousness is liberated from the phantoms of the past and directed toward the construction of the New World on the basis of a new understanding of cooperation and knowledge. As I have already written on these themes, I will quote from one of my letters, it might be helpful to you:\n\nEvery great Teacher, speaking of the end of the world, could not have had in mind the final completion of the evolution of our planet. For if evolution were to follow its natural course of development, the planet would enter its seventh and last cycle and its humanity would enter the Seventh Race, with all its sub-races, so that at the crowning of such an evolution there could not be a Day of Judgment. For by that time humanity and the planet would have reached the condition of the higher worlds where there is no imperfection or conscious opposition to good by any evil force.\n\nBut of course, the Great Teachers knew the difficult karma of humanity and the planet. They knew of the threatening danger, and therefore They had in mind the approaching removal of the race, which is always followed by tremendous cosmic cataclysms and is foreshadowed by the great sorting in advance of the final Judgment. Being Initiates, They knew that this catastrophe could become the Last Day, owing to the terrible downfall of spirituality in the human race. Quite possibly, there may not be a sufficient amount of high counteracting, or rather, discharging energies to save the planet from the final gigantic explosion. To this explosion the Prince of the World is directing all his efforts, since he knows that in a purified atmosphere pierced by the new fiery rays, or energies, the spheres of Earth will become unbearable for him, and his continued presence here made impossible. Therefore, he strives for an explosion in order to float away on the wreck.\n\nRemember, in the Teaching it is said that precisely the spirit of man can become the exploder of the planet. It is mentioned also that the number of dischargers is very small, and that They bear the whole burden of maintaining the planet’s balance. A strong spirit can save a whole area from earthquake. Thus, in the ancient days, the Great Teachers sent their advanced disciples to places threatened by earthquakes.\n\nMany naive people think that the dark ones act only through evil, corruption and crime. How wrong they are! Only crude and relatively insignificant forces act in this way. Much more dangerous are those who masquerade under the Light of the Teaching.\n\nIgnorance and lack of intuition push many into the arms of darkness, and deprive them for a long time, if not forever, of the salutary influence and attraction of the rays of the great Stronghold of Light. Dreadful is Armageddon—the dark forces are struggling for their very existence. Despair unites them and makes them so persistent in trying to achieve their aim. The Prince of the World has very many talented collaborators—some conscious, some unconscious—and it is foolish to think that they do not know the ways of the most cunning subtlety. They are very shrewd and inventive, and they act according to the level of their victims. But all of them lack tolerance and warmth of heart. Thus intertwined is darkness with Light on our Earth.\n\nThe snare of darkness is woven by skillful hands.\n\nMany terrifying things are now practiced in the world. A great deal of the most disgusting sorcery is spread all over Earth. Of course the biggest centers of population are usually chosen by the main dark forces and are used as their centers. And their best weapon is the ignorant masses. That is why the unity of all the white and near-white forces is so essential! But the latter so easily become greyish and fill the ranks of those of whom it is said in the Apocalypse, “because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.” Only the power of devotion and the striving to serve the Great Hierarchy of Light can save from the widely spread snares of the Prince of the World.\n\nYes, the wave of evil is inundating Earth, and all the efforts of the self-denying workers of Light are needed in order to save the sinking vessel of humanity! That is why it is so extremely important to send out the sparks of Light, but at the same time to watch lest he who receives a spark, by lending it to one who does not merit it, set fire to the whole structure. The human soul is bottomless! And the most dreadful scourge of the soul is ambition; verily, there is not a worse foe, nor a more common one. If this viper is not checked immediately, it assumes the size of a boa constrictor. Ambition is a burning scourge for the stoutest hearts, and a terrible torture, which man cruelly prepares for himself.\n\nOnce more, I welcome you in your beautiful work. In spite of difficulties, treasure the higher joy of achievement. This joy of achievement must be cultivated in oneself as well as in others. This is most essential, since only in it lies the pledge of the salvation of humanity, the pledge for the approach of the New World! Great Spiritual Toilers and heroes are needed! Thus, create heroes! This was the farewell bidding of one of the Highest Spirits when he was leaving our planet. Let us become heroines and spiritual toilers, and we shall be taking the shortest path, until a joyous meeting.\n\nThe joy of the future is ordained, but, indeed, the period of waiting at the threshold is always wearisome.\n\n2\n\nThe Teaching of Living Ethics is by no means for the weak-hearted, and therefore only well-tested souls should be accepted into this group—it is quality, not quantity that counts. If there is a shortage of strong hearts, it is better not to start. One should not profane the Teaching of Light, and besides, we are not missionaries. It is said in the Teaching that anyone who is forcibly enticed would become a “millstone on the neck.” We are searching for free souls, unfettered by any fears. “The Teaching is not sugar-coated nuts and it is not silver trinkets. The Teaching is rich silver ore.” The books of the Teaching will spread, and, what is more important, they will get into the right hands. So many souls are looking for Light and for new values amidst the chaos of scorned and abased lofty concepts. From all corners of the world come enquiries and pleas for more knowledge about how to join the Army of Light. That is why it is so joyous for us to carry our lamp.\n\nYou write about caution, but who knows the need for it better than I? But I know also of courage, of creative daring, and first of all, of great balance. Therefore, caution should not turn into the fear that springs from persecution, neither should daring become senseless bravado. However, because of my very nature, I prefer the latter; I believe in the wise proverb, “God helps the brave,” and also another, a more prosaic one, “To be afraid of wolves means not going to the woods, not picking mushrooms.” Thus, let us say that caution must be combined with daring and should be applied in wise co-measurement with the circumstances and conditions. But the sparks of Light, which kindle the new consciousnesses, should be cast into space, for otherwise where would be the guiding Principle? Without these sparks of Light, all will sink into darkness and deterioration.\n\nI know that extracts from my letter caused all sorts of comments, but what does it matter? Praise emanating from certain types can only result in humiliation and pollution; I would therefore prefer to be attacked by them. The ancient wisdom says, “Name your enemies, and I shall tell who you are.” And the Teaching says, “Without slander grateful humanity would have interred the most vital manifestations.” We should add to this the wisdom of Christ, “A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.” (St. Mark 6:4). This truth has been repeated by all the hounded and persecuted benefactors of mankind, during all times and in all nations, but, alas, it will remain as strong as ever until humanity goes through the fiery baptism of the spirit. Thus, I am not afraid of anathema, and hardly anyone who is truly devoted to the Teaching and to the evolution of the spirit is afraid of it. Hence, I shall never renounce my convictions: I believe in the Unutterable Divine Principle, which abides in each human being, and I believe in the birth of Christ in the human soul on its way to perfection. Moreover, every educated man knows the significance of the terms Krestos or Kristos (Christ), and that they were taken from the pagan vocabulary. I wrote recently to one of my co-workers about the meaning of this term, and I will repeat it to you. Krestos was the designation given to a neophyte who was on probation as a candidate for the degree of Hierophant. Only after a disciple went through all the sufferings and passed all the tests, in the last ritual of initiation he was anointed and became according to the language of the Mysteries, Christ, “the purified.” His finite personality was fused with his infinite individuality and he then became an immortal Ego. For the first Christians, the word Christos or Christ was synonymous with our higher Ego. In this sense, one should understand that Christ is the Redeemer of sins. Thus, the redemption of personal sins is performed by the soul—the conductor and the messenger of Christ—perpetually, during the long chain of earthly lives of our individual Ego. “The Christ on the cross, of every human being, must descend into Hades at some point of its evolution, in order to bring back to normal conditions the soul that has been plunged therein as an effect of the evil deeds of its lower self. In other words, Divine Love must reach down into the heart of man, conquer and regenerate the man, before he can appreciate the enormity of his offenses against Divine Law and forgive himself for the sins committed against himself, and forgiveness must be obtained to complete at-one-ment.” [Teachings of the Temple (Halcyon, California: The Temple of the People, 1948) p. 404]\n\nIn Christianity, I adhere to the faith of the first Christian Fathers, and I especially revere the great Origen and St. Anthony. I dream of a new ecumenical council, which would return to the pure foundations of the early centuries of Christianity. In the wonderful books of Dobrotolubye [Love of the Good] one can find beautiful thoughts. One even comes across praise for the enemies! Because no one but they can evoke so well our hidden abilities and qualities; and so they have been called “Christ’s cauterizers,” for in ancient days many diseases were treated by cauterization.\n\nIt is admirable that you plan to apply the Teaching in life. Verily, just as faith is dead without deeds, so the Teaching is useless without its application in life.\n\nI understand what you mean in your letter and what you would like to learn. But I must warn you that I am against any kind of sentimentality and the rosy promises about the ease of attainments that abide in the late occult literature. Precisely they engender so many lukewarm, halfway aspirations which lead nowhere. Life has taught me how dangerous are all sorts of promises and encouragement of impossible hopes, how ruinous they can be, and how much betrayal they may cause. Therefore I do not like to conceal the reality if I see that the spirit is ready to accept it. I would rather keep silent than lull one with rosy promises.\n\nAnd how can one promise anything when the key to all achievements is in man himself, and without his participation no one else can do anything for him? The Highest Teacher can help him only at a certain period when the spirit is ready to open the heart to the Call and to put into action his dormant divine forces. However, the strengthening of these forces is possible only if the disciple constantly continues to intensify his efforts to perfect and transfigure his inner being. Collaboration is a necessary condition in everything. Therefore, you should point out to all newcomers that there are endless degrees of discipleship and of the approach to Light, and that each one can occupy only that degree which corresponds to his past accumulations; likewise, he can ascend the ladder only by his own intensive striving in the present.\n\nBut the path of Service is still more difficult, since this is the path of achievement, which requires complete self-denial. You may think that our life is easy, but if you knew the reality, your heart would speak differently. In order to bear the entire burden of the awesome responsibility and ever-growing difficulties, I affirm myself every day in joy and readiness to face the most difficult. Indeed, beauty is in self-denial. And now more than ever the world needs spiritual toilers and heroes, now, in the threatening days of Armageddon.\n\nBut, I do not summon anyone, and you should not call the spiritually immature, because an excessive burden is not useful. Great tempering of spirit and heart is necessary, for each day brings us all sorts of trials. The strain and tension of a bearer of the burden of the New World is awful! His work is performed on three planes; by his energies, he discharges the surrounding atmosphere, often preventing destructive earthquakes in his vicinity; he carries the burden of those who turn to him and is greatly responsible for all that is entrusted to him. Only very strong spirits can enter the Path of Service. Therefore one should never entice, or tempt by rosy promises.\n\nCertainly, even the thorough reading of the books of the Teaching will invariably bring benefit through broadening the consciousness, thus affording a possibility for new flights of the spirit. But it is impossible to expect immediate fiery achievements and a fiery transmutation of the centers if the Teaching is applied spasmodically. The occult laws are exact and unfailing. The most exact correspondence prevails in the realm of the occult. Also, newcomers should be warned about one more occult law which is beautifully described by H. P. Blavatsky in an article called “Warning” in the third volume of The Secret Doctrine.\n\nThe coming year, 1936, which has already begun esoterically, will lay the foundation for many remarkable events. However, very few will be able to comprehend their significance. Just remember that everything happens in Inscrutable Ways; and therein is great wisdom, otherwise the dark forces would destroy all the best possibilities and beginnings. Thus, the proverb, “Man proposes, and God disposes,” is particularly true in decisive events.\n\nI believe that you would fulfill a great task if you could take a stand for the defense of the Teaching. There are so many opportunities where you could say a good word, and one need not look for special occasions or deliver unusual speeches. An appropriate word, spoken at the right time, often leads to great deeds, or arrests ruinous results.\n\nAnd so, please do not worry too much. Strive with your heart toward the Teaching, and much will be simplified and become clear. Each luminous undertaking is created in unexpected ways.\n\nTrue, the volcano is raging, and much darkness is around, but those devoted to the service for the Common Good need not be alarmed. Calamities always happen to the lukewarm ones, those who follow half-ways and are fond of half-measures. We shall not err in saying that the peril to the world lies in half-measures and in non-resistance to evil. Verily, we live again in the times of Atlantis! Only now one should provide not an ark, but an airplane. And the best airplane is the wings of the spirit.\n\nCourageously accept vigilance, and strong faith in the Leading Hand will carry you over any and all abysses. Courage, courage, and again courage—is today’s dictum. The feathers of fear pull us down, whereas the wings of courage carry us over the abyss. Thus, let us be inspired by the beauty of courage and by the power of faith in the luminous future. I send joy to you, but this is a special joy, it is the joy of difficulties. When we shall learn not to be frightened by difficulties, we shall come close to the bearing of achievement.\n\n3\n\nThe definition of the Monad is correct. Thus, in The Secret Doctrine it is said that, “the Monad or Jiva per se cannot be even called spirit: it is a ray, a breath of the ABSOLUTE, or the Absoluteness rather… having no relations with the conditioned and relative finiteness, [Absoluteness] is unconscious on our plane. Therefore, besides the material which will be needed for its future human form, the monad requires (a) a spiritual model, or prototype, for that material to shape itself into; and (b) an intelligent consciousness to guide its evolution and progress, neither of which is possessed by the homogeneous monad, or by senseless though living matter. The Adam of dust requires the Soul of Life to be breathed into him: the two middle principles, which are the sentient life of the irrational animal and the Human Soul, for the former is irrational without the latter.” Thus, “The Monad becomes a personal ego when it incarnates; and something remains of that [incarnate] personality through Manas, when the latter is perfect enough to assimilate Buddhi.” [The Secret Doctrine, trans. Helena Roerich (Riga, Uguns, 1937)] Thus, individuality is built gradually, and can only be partially expressed on Earth.\n\nMore from The Secret Doctrine: “Metaphysically speaking, it is of course an absurdity to talk of the ‘development’ of a Monad, or to say that it becomes ‘Man’… It stands to reason that a MONAD cannot either progress or develop, or even be affected by the changes of states it passes through. It is not of this world or plane, and may be compared only to an indestructible star of divine light and fire, thrown down on to our Earth as a plank of salvation for the personalities in which it indwells. It is for the latter to cling to it; and thus partaking of its divine nature, obtain immortality. Left to itself the Monad will cling to no one; but, like the ‘plank,’ be drifted away to another incarnation by the unresting current of evolution.” It is also advisable to reread paragraph 275 in Agni Yoga.\n\nAnd now with regard to Divine Love, what else can it be but the Great Principle, or the beginning of attraction, or affinity, or that very Fohat in its differentiation as Divine Love (Eros), the electric power of affinity and sympathy, allegorically manifested in the attempt to combine the pure spirit, which is a ray inseparable from the One or Absolute, with the soul. These two form the monad in man, whereas in nature it is the first link between the eternally unconditional and the manifested.\n\nI am happy to tell you that I receive the most beautiful reports about your book. It is so pleasing to hear that, after having read your book, young souls are looking to you for leadership.\n\nWork joyously, and bring light to the seeking souls.\n\n4\n\nI received your letter a few days ago, and of course I would be very glad to help you. However, I think it is my duty to warn you that I do not agree with many of the statements in the books mentioned by you; moreover, I consider them to be even harmful. In life we come across bearers of various states of consciousness, and we must follow those responding most closely to our own spiritual and intellectual development. If, therefore, my words shall make you feel indignant, say so, and we shall send a friendly greeting to each other, while each follows his own path.\n\nI am not familiar with the doctrine of the Liberal Catholic Church, and am therefore unable to say anything either for or against it. With regard to Donov, I have heard of him and have also read his good little book Three Foundations of Life [Peter Donov (Riga, Gudkov, 1931)]. However, I must oppose your remark, and must state that there is only one Hierarchy of Light, which is of course, the Trans-Himalayan Hierarchy. Just as Light conquers darkness, so does the Hierarchy of Light battle against and defeat the hierarchy of darkness. The latter is very strong, since it acts through a multitude of followers. Not one teacher, living on Earth in ordinary earthly conditions, can be compared with the great Himalayan Masters. Those Masters are so lofty in their spiritual achievement that they are no longer able to accept the burden of purely earthly existence and of a personal, direct leadership of and contact with the masses. That would constitute an unproductive expenditure of forces. Their tasks are planetary-cosmic to such an extent that They can allocate only a portion of Their forces to the direct guidance of certain units of humanity, and therefore They use Their nearest trusted ones and disciples for the purpose of transmitting the spiritual Teaching. At the present time, Their main forces are concentrated on the gigantic battle with the destructive dark forces in the Subtle World and on Earth, on staying the clashing of the nations until a certain time, and on suppressing the subterranean fire which threatens to explode our planet. Verily, frightful is the tension of Their forces for the salvation of Earth; while humanity, in its madness, walls up dynamite everywhere. Thus, because of such small numbers of co-workers on Earth, these selfless Guardians of ungrateful and ignorant humanity have taken completely upon themselves the incredible burden of discharging destructive energies.\n\nYou write that you want knowledge, knowledge, and again knowledge! I presume you mean spiritual knowledge. If you have the fiery and constant striving toward the one chosen Image of the Hierarch of Light, you will achieve it. And the degree of this knowledge will depend wholly upon the accumulations of your own Chalice in previous lives, and on the power and ardor of your strivings in this life.\n\nIf you are to succeed you must remember constantly and ardently with your heart the One Chosen Image. Also, if you wish to practice self-discipline, choose one or two of your worst qualities or habits and try to rid yourself of them. This discipline seems very simple, but in reality is extremely complex and difficult; still it is certainly the most fundamental method.\n\nYou say that the counsels in Agni Yoga are so scattered that it is difficult to combine them into a system. However, to this I will say that this is the Teaching of Life in all its complexity, and the counsels were given to the disciples precisely on examples from life, when the circumstances which caused them arose; in this way they could be more easily assimilated. Indeed, the whole of nature demonstrates how a perfect organism develops its organs simultaneously, and not successively. Thus, the Teaching of Life is so constructed that on each new step the consciousness is able to embrace the greatest possible periphery and thus enter life, yet not be withdrawn from it.\n\nHave you the first books, Leaves of Morya’s Garden I and II? In a way, they are an introduction to the Agni Yoga Series, but in essence they actually deal with the majority of questions and aspects of life which are treated in detail and elucidated from different angles in the next volumes of the Teaching.\n\nYou are right, the purer the conductor, the easier it is for the Forces of Light to operate through him—indeed, purity of soul is essential. As it is said, purified psychic energy is a panacea for all diseases.\n\n5\n\nYour statement is correct: precisely, the Fire of Space, when realized is transmuted into psychic energy. The so-called principles in us (excluding the physical body and the etheric double, which dissipate after death) are only aspects, or conditions, of our consciousness. Indeed all sub-divisions (spirit, soul, higher or lower Manas) are in reality only various qualities of the same fundamental energy of fire, life or consciousness—the highest aspect of which is psychic energy. Therefore, in order to attain the Fiery World—the world of the higher spirituality—we have to transmute or sublimate the fires of our nerve centers up to their seventh state. Thus, the Fiery World is the world of sublimated feelings or consciousness. Verily not one human feeling disappears; it exists in its subtle condition in the Fiery World and responds to higher attractions and vibrations. The whole of Cosmos is built upon the septenary principle, therefore, each energy, each manifestation includes in itself its septenary scale of tension and refinement.\n\nAnd now, concerning the Mother of the World, each concept should be considered in its various aspects. Each cosmic principle or manifestation has its reflections or embodiments on Earth. Thus, the Mother of the World, when considered in her cosmic aspect, is Mulaprakriti, the One, all-containing, all-conceiving. In the earthly reflection, however, She is the Great Spirit of the Feminine Principle. Behind each manifestation, each aspect, and each symbol stands the great Individuality. Thus, each high Individuality has its own substitutes or personifiers, the nearest to it by ray, and sometimes it appears personally in such incarnations. Hence the concept of Avatara. Thus, the high Spirit that was incarnated, let us say, as Isis, Ishtar, etc., did not necessarily have to be the spirit of the Mother of the World, but was impregnated by her Ray; and, indeed, because of this, in the later legends the image of Isis became fused with the Image of the Great Mother of the World.\n\nYes, the period of our planet is now passing through is very grave and tense. Frequent earthquakes have poisoned the atmosphere closest to Earth, and one can expect outbursts of new madnesses in human consciousness. That is why it is so important to spread the books of Living Ethics. It is excellent that you pay attention to various omens—you should write them down.\n\nI do not agree with you that eloquence is so essential. It is not a bad asset, but that is all. Of most importance is the quality of one’s aura. Often, an eloquent speaker leaves just a fleeting impression, that is, if the spiritual tension of his aura was insignificant. Whereas two or three words spoken from the heart by a bearer of a luminous aura may transform the one who comes into touch with him. Thus, the main influence comes not from words, but rather from the quality and the tension of our inner fire. The very presence of such fiery aura in a large and mixed gathering brings soothing accord. It can happen that a mediocre lecturer, for some reason, singularly kindles his audience, and he gives himself the credit for it; but in reality there may have been in the crowd one or two intense harmonious auras, which, by their powerful vibrations, created the atmosphere favorable for perception. Arhip Ivanovich Kuinji, the teacher of N.K. [Prof. Nicholas Roerich.], was quite devoid of the gift of words. With difficulty, and between lengthy pauses, he could combine only a few words, but by the power of his inner fire, he could make such a tremendous impression with those few words. This abrupt speech suited his powerful spirit—like the heavy blows of a sculptor’s hammer, it could bring forth sparks from blocks of stone!\n\n6\n\nOne must not be disturbed by disagreements between representatives of the various religio-philosophical systems, for out of the friction of opinions fly sparks of one Truth! However, I would certainly advise you to become more fully acquainted with the Eastern thought; many problems will then be solved easily. The difficulty lies in the fact that the Western mind can hardly, if at all, accept contradictions, whereas this acceptance is considered by the East as precisely the foundation of its philosophical systems, beginning with cosmogony and cosmology and ending with the moral code. Thus, he who worships only the formless Aspect in the highest state of illumination exclaims, “Verily, Formless and Form are one. Brahman (the highest Reality) and Maya (illusion) are one!”\n\nAlso it is essential to explain what is Samadhi, or the highest spiritual illumination. So much is written about this state by people who have never experienced it, or who have just experienced it in its slightest form. But there are as many gradations of Samadhi as there are degrees of consciousness and cycles of spiritual perfectment. The degree of illumination obtained corresponds always with our spiritual accumulations. Hence the variety in the depth of these illuminations should be made clear. If the attainment of Samadhi could give us omniscience, then the idea of Infinity would have to be abandoned. Moreover, the consciousness immersed in Samadhi obtains illumination in accordance with its individual accumulations and the spheres accessible to it, and can transfer only a part of these experiences to the physical plane. For the physical organism is unable to respond for a long time to the highest vibrations and impress them upon the brain without ruinous effects. Science has already proven the destructive effect of discrepant vibrations. Thus, a man returning from Samadhi retains certain memories, but this does not imply that he becomes all-knowing and that henceforth he can penetrate into the essence of any event. He has seen or experienced a certain state of ecstasy or a higher tension of emotion, or he has gained insight into the essence of this or that manifestation. Thus he may have achieved the perception of eternal being, of the highest love, of the beauty of Be-ness, of the unity of all beings, or of his presence in everything and union with all and everything; nevertheless, he will not become omniscient in the earthly sense of the word. Perceptions in Samadhi are of a different nature; one may come close to the nuomena of things, but on returning to Earth one must study their effects by earthly methods. It is, of course, exceedingly difficult to describe in words the inexpressible. But still, “Thought reigns above all Samadhi. The higher, the more powerful. The more flaming the thought, the more useful the manifestation. Truly, thought is all-powerful and limitless.” Moreover, on our planet the attainment of Samadhi is accessible only to a high Arhat who lives in completely different conditions. Certainly Vivekananda did not achieve complete Samadhi, but, not being sufficiently prepared for it physically, even the degree of Samadhi in which he was immersed brought its sad results. His earthly death was the result of this premature and forcible experience.\n\nThe human organism of our planetary cycle is still far from such perceptions, and therefore lengthy preparation is needed, not only for this kind of manifestation but also for lesser fiery ones. The very finest vibrations of the unregulated force of Kundalini may destroy a body which is not trained or tempered for its acceptance. Let us bear in mind that the so-called “yogi, ” Ramacharaka (an American by the name of Atkinson), certainly was never a yogi even if he was amongst the listeners of Vivekananda. Hence the freedom with which he writes about mechanical methods without clarifying all the dangers connected with such forcing.\n\nThousands of books dealing with easy mechanical methods of developing the hidden lower psychic powers are now thrown upon the world book market. In truth, these ignorant and irresponsible writers are collaborating with the forces of darkness. The latter want nothing so much as to open certain centers in people and thus get hold of them, and through them to join in earthly life in order to fulfill their dark plans. Indeed they are trying to retain around Earth an atmosphere polluted by the very low emanations necessary for their existence.\n\nWithout doubt, simple, rhythmic breathing is in itself quite beneficial. People forget not only the benefit to be derived from fresh air but precisely how to breathe correctly, which actually is the foundation of our health. However, the pranayama of Hatha Yoga has nothing to do with such rhythmic breathing. The pranayama employed by the Hatha Yogis has as its purpose, by means of suspension of breath, rotation and other gymnastics, the arousing and calling forth of an influx of blood to certain centers, thus causing their increased activity. But one can well imagine how harmful it can be for a man to arouse the centers that are in organs which, for some reason, are weakened or even diseased; certainly their diseased condition will only be intensified. That explains why there are so many unfortunate cases among those who practice pranayama under ignorant and irresponsible teachers. The opening of the centers can safely take place only under the guidance of a Great Teacher, who sees the true condition of one’s organism in all its complexity, and who knows what can be applied or permitted, and when. Let us bear in mind that precisely during the transmutation of the centers a tremendous tension and influx of blood toward them take place. The Teacher must know how, at times, to transfer these tensions to a less dangerous place, or to divert the excess of blood, in order to avoid general conflagration and even fiery death. Believe me, the Teacher will not lose a single moment if a disciple is ready for such transmutation, and will provide whatever is necessary for his organism in accordance with his way of life.\n\nI have written enough to my correspondents about the harm of mechanical ways, and about the danger of the development of mediumship. For true discipleship, it is essential to apply the strength of the spirit and to know the truth, rather than to be tempted by all sorts of tricks, accessible to any medium.\n\nAfter my definition of Samadhi, you can see how relative are illuminations. The concept of Infinity excludes the possibility of ever achieving absolute knowledge, and therein lies the entire grandeur—this is LIFE. Each Manvantara, each cycle has its truth, and humanity is given that portion of it which can be assimilated during that particular cycle. Of course, the Arhats cannot disagree on fundamental principles, but even they are perpetually learning and deepening their knowledge. Is it possible to imagine complete cognition? Surely that would be equivalent to annihilation! Indeed, what then would happen with our consciousness, the very essence of which lies in perpetual motion and perception? Infinite is life, and infinite are its perceptions and possibilities. I will conclude my explanation, with joy in the Immeasurable and Unutterable Grandeur.\n\nAnd now regarding the Voice of Silence, or the voice of the Invisible Teacher. Most certainly, this voice may not necessarily be the voice of our higher Ego, but precisely the voice of the Teacher; for these manifestations are almost indissolubly linked with each other. Is it possible to hear the voice of the Teacher if our higher Ego is in a “somnolent” state? In true spiritual development (and not in the case of a medium) our higher Ego is indeed receptive to the voice of the Invisible Teacher. Therefore, when we begin to hear the voice of the Teacher, we also hear the voice of our higher Ego.\n\nDo not be distressed, and remember that “all is possible in the realm of the spirit.” Think of the parable about Dgul Nor in the Teaching. Once this formula is firmly realized, the mysticism which attracts you cannot be lost. Truly, we live in Infinity, and one should never lose sight of the significance of this majestic concept. Thus, trust your heart more; this is the only measurement, always and in everything.\n\nRegarding Mme. Kryjanovsky, for your information I may tell you that the best pages in her books are written, based, and compiled on automatic writings and also on the visions of her blind sister. I was told this by a friend of their family. Besides, she was undoubtedly well acquainted with many occult writings. She certainly read the works of H. P. Blavatsky, for there is a quotation from The Secret Doctrine in her series of books about the Magi. But it is quite possible that H. P. B. herself borrowed this particular passage from some travel books. At the end of the last century, Western literature, particularly that in English, was enriched by not a small quantity of so-called occult novels, which often testified to the considerable spiritual enlightenment of their authors. Along with some remarkable pages in Kryjanovsky’s novels, one also finds a great deal of vulgarity. Nevertheless, I prefer her “Magi” series to many contemporary novels, for books of this kind always awaken the imagination of the reader and inspire him, over and above grey commonness, toward the unusual and beautiful.\n\nCertain writers erroneously attempt to make a Celt and a western Initiate out of Rama, this purest Aryan, an Avatar of Vishnu, and the hero of the majestic epic poem the Ramayana. The Cycle of Rama definitely exists, because Rama is an Avatar of Vishnu, and consequently the energies of his spirit nourish the consciousness of humanity for a particular term, or cycle.\n\nSt. Yves d’Alveidre was a psychic and a medium; and toward the end of his life, he fell under the sway of his astral instructors to such an extent that his books are perhaps even more erroneous than the books of some other authors of occult novels. Of course, his Agarta and the Supreme Pontiff are his peculiar refraction of the great Shambhala and its Lord. It is amusing to see how he mixed existing exoteric legends with the astral accumulations and instructions received by him from astral impersonators. He is a victim of irresponsible astral instructors. Thus, the name Vatan, given for a secret language sounds strange to an Orientalist. According to him, he got this word from some initiated Brahmin, but in Arabic, Urdu, and Persian, vatan means motherland. Apparently, St. Yves d’Alveidre misunderstand the man with whom he was talking, and who was simply trying to tell him about his mother tongue.\n\nI have read his biography, and it is obvious that he was not a bad person, but that his mediumistic nature and his interest in spiritualism enfeebled his weak organism, resulting in mental imbalance.\n\nTo show you to what extent the lofty concept of the Stronghold of the Great Brotherhood in its various aspects penetrates and lives in the consciousness of different nations, I will cite for you certain information about a presently existing society in the Far East. This society has many members and, as I understand, accepts even foreigners into its midst. It has its sacred army, which has nothing in common with a military organization. However, it adheres strictly to the established hierarchic principles. The main meeting place of this society, which is called “The Extraordinary Moment,” is on one of the local “holy mountains.” Now, this sacred army is preparing for an “Extraordinary Moment,” which is understood in the broadest and, what is most important, in the spiritual sense. Thus, according to their teaching, the world is now facing a crisis, after which its spiritual regeneration, or rather new birth, may be expected. Thus, all sorts of conferences, conflicts, all sorts of attractions and repulsions are greatly on the increase. Humanity is suffering the pains of childbirth, but “the time will come when the gates of Heaven will open, and the earthly world will return to the heavenly world.” Six stages, six steps lead to this moment:\n\n1. The first period of the Omens—the end of the Great War.\n\n2. The second period of the Omens—political and economic failures due to international psychology.\n\n3. The first period of cataclysms (short)—unprecedented upheavals in the whole world.\n\n4. The second period of cataclysms (short)—the appearance of Heavenly Forces in the arena.\n\n5. The first period of constructiveness—the enlightened reign of the Heavenly Emperor in the world, governmental order marked by monism of the religious cult and of the affairs of state. This will be a hegemony of Light over the world, dispensed by the Heavenly Emperor through the establishment of inviolable institutions of power, which by that time will be in effect. This enlightened reign will be expressed by a special term. …\n\n6. The second period of constructiveness—the coming of divinely inspired rulers, representatives of science, technology, etc. At present, according to the members of this society, the world is in the second of the stages mentioned above. The prophets of this movement speak of the new world as the kingdom of Spirit, through direct communion of men with gods. This, they say, will be an earthly life without disease and hardships; life illumined by the light of Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Joy, and Love; life directed by the Heavenly Emperor on the principle of justice. In all this, the most remarkable thing is that this Great Plan was, they say, conceived many thousands of years ago and the Central World Encampment of the Great Gods upon the Sacred Mountain, where gods gather together, and its earthly projection is the mountain of this holy vicinity. So you can see how a great thought is refracted by all nations, and inevitably each one of them attributes the main role to its own people and country.\n\nDo not blame T., he really did not know Russia. The deliberately distorted ideas regarding Russia held even today by foreigners only reveal their ignorance. For the majority of foreigners, Russia was and is a country of vandalism, all sorts of violations and license, and, above all, of profound ignorance. Even the best minds believe that Russia has not progressed very far since the times of Ivan the Terrible. Civilization has supplanted the meaning of culture, and many do not understand that one can be a civilized savage. People forget that the accumulations of culture are gathered over centuries, whereas civilization can be established in one decade.\n\nIt is true that there cannot be any disagreement among the Arhats, for the truth they know is the truth attainable by the spirit who has completed his self-perfectment not only for Earth but also for the highest planets of our solar system.\n\nIn The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett it is said regarding Buddha that his spirit had run so successfully through his previous incarnations that he “escaped further reincarnations, but only on this earth… he will have to get reincarnated on the next planet. Only, … he will be re-born in the highest—the seventh ring of the upper planet.” Infinite is life and infinite are its attainments and possibilities. And so I shall finish this letter rejoicing at the Immeasurable and Unutterable Grandeur.\n\n7\n\nIt is most essential to point out the difference between mediumship, psychism and true spiritual development. Much harm has been done by books about all kinds of Hatha Yoga exercises. What ignorance is displayed in thinking that the highest and subtlest can be achieved by purely mechanical methods! You are quite right when you say that people, in striving for spiritual development (which to them so often means the achievement of psychic powers), forget that without active service to the General Good this development will be one-sided and unstable. Our inner fires are kindled only through contact with people. Only thus can we test ourselves; only thus shall we be able to sharpen and temper the blade of our spirit. Undoubtedly, certain isolation and periodic retreat is essential for the restoration of our forces. However, constant seclusion will never provide that tension of our forces which alone can bring their refinement. Many statements in the Teaching confirm this. For example, in the second book of Leaves of Morya’s Garden, on page 47, it is said: “Christ, Buddha, and their closest co-workers did not use magic formulae but acted and created in full blending with the spirit. Therefore, in the new evolution the former artificial methods must be abandoned. …The mechanics of yogism are no longer suitable for the regeneration of the world.” [Emphasis added.] And further on, “Many times have saints returned to Earth because they had conveyed to the crowd too much of their exaltation instead of the structure of life. We are absolutely averse to monasteries, for they are the antithesis of life. … Indeed, through life one must attain.” [Emphasis added] Likewise in the book Agni Yoga it is said, in the middle of paragraph 161. “Raja Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga are all isolated from their surrounding reality [from active participation in life]; and because of this they cannot enter into the evolution of the future.” And in paragraph 163, “This most unifying Yoga [Agni Yoga] exacts an obligation to construct [Emphasis added] the entire life in conformity with a discipline externally imperceptible.” This means that while constructing and working, one should take certain precautions and should follow the indicated regimen for maintaining health. Thus, if we study the lives of the Great Teachers of humanity, we shall discover that none of them shut themselves off from life, but poured all their forces, spiritual and physical, into the service of the General Good. Thus, in everything let us follow these great examples in a lofty attainment of self-renunciation. The crown of self-renunciation is glorious!\n\nYou could in turn, ask your questioners, “Would your spiritual development be benefited by knowledge of the degree of the spiritual height of Christ and Buddha?” You can quote to them from paragraph 8, page 190 of the second book of Leaves of Morya’s Garden: “People will ask: ‘Who is greater, Christ or Buddha?’ Answer: ‘It is impossible to measure the far-off worlds. We can only be enraptured by their radiance.’” Verily, compared to us Earth-dwellers, Christ and Buddha are indeed far-off stars of the Spirit. Let us remember that They, and also the Lord Maitreya, came from Venus at the dawn of the formation of physical man, therefore They are our Divine Forefathers and Masters.\n\nNow, about St. Yves d’Alveidre, he was a typical psychic, who practiced spiritualism and came under the control of astral impersonators. His books are a strange mixture of fragments of truth with errors.\n\nCertainly, to those unacquainted with Eastern thought, and who are approaching the Teaching of Living Ethics for the first time, one must give only as much as their consciousness is ready to assimilate. As it is said, “We must not intercept someone’s thought, but infuse the new blood of life by nurturing the nervous system. Each answering word must be not the nail of a coffin but the physician’s ray. [Emphasis added.] A deferred reply may come in the form of advice.”\n\nDisillusioning people or shattering their point of view is only permissible when great caution is used. We can do it gradually by suggesting fragments of new thought, by a gradual process of broadening the consciousness; but it is dangerous to make a too abrupt break. To be sure, for some people books like the novels of Kryjanovsky or the fantasies of St. Yves d’Alveidre are inspiring, so that a strong criticism of such books might extinguish the weak flame of their spirits. Only strong spirits, unattached to earthly things, are able to face the truth in all its superterrestrial beauty. But it is inadmissible to open the eyes by force.\n\nAnd now something else. Suggestion, if applied with force for the purpose of gain, is not only interference in karma but is plainly criminal. Whereas if we inspire and call forth lofty thoughts in man and his finer essence, or if we can restrain him from vice, such action is, of course, benevolent.\n\nIf, while doing good, we take a certain part of karma upon ourselves, such karma surely does not encumber our spiritual progress. Only the Arhat knows where and when he must not help; as for ourselves, we should stretch forth a helping hand whenever our heart tells us to do so. While doing this, however, we must always remember the law of commensurability and goal-fitness, also, that spiritual help is the highest.\n\nThere are some people who think they should give everything away, thereby making themselves dependent upon others! To such people we might speak with these words of the Teaching, “Who hath said that one must renounce madly! Madness doth so remain.” However, one must help, for who knows when we are paying our old debts! Thus, if we refuse to help, we might thereby increase the interest on our debt with accumulating interest. It is a great mistake to refuse to help one’s near ones because of fear of complicating one’s own karma. Will this not be an act of the greatest egoism or selfhood? But of course one must learn to discriminate at the same time, since often one may help the undeserving and refuse the one truly in need. Here, as well, the heart is the only judge. Thus, if the help required is within our power, we should render it.\n\nAbove all, we should remember that our karma is created, weighted, or eased mainly by THOUGHTS. Precisely, thought and inner motives weave our aura, which is a magnetic field that either attracts or repels possibilities. Indeed, thought-motive—this decisive factor of our karma—is often overlooked by those who discuss karma. But were it otherwise, it would be impossible to break the magic circle of causes and effects. For all is karma and all is held by karma. However, when we finish one round of karma for a certain cycle, we start a new round on other planes and worlds, and so unto Infinity. When the conclusion of karma is spoken of, it means that karma is ended only for a certain cycle or planet, etc. Thus, the conclusion of a man’s karma on our planet means that his inner nature has purified and transmuted its energies to such an extent that further physical life on Earth can no longer give him anything; precisely, all the elements or energies which formed his being have reached that state of perfection which was the limit for this planet. Such a spirit, depending upon his mission, either stays in the higher spheres around Earth or leaves for the higher worlds. Thus, thought is the primary cause and the crown of all creation. Thoughts rule the world, consequently they rule karma.\n\nDo not be unhappy because of the necessity for spending so much time earning your living. We must all earn our bread. Indeed, all should be accomplished without retiring from life and by earthly hands and feet. Therein lies great beauty. Is labor performed in comfort and prosperity of great value? And do we ever hear much about such labor? No, all the giants of thought created amidst most trying circumstances. The work performed in ease and affluence cannot bring about the necessary tension of all the centers.\n\nVerily, material prosperity and ease are our most dangerous enemies. Nothing extinguishes the inner fire so quickly as security for the morrow. We do not know such security, and we work on the border of exigency and possibilities. However, at a difficult moment, when all our forces are tensed, when we have applied all our resourcefulness, help comes, but at the last moment—such is the law. All earthly burdens are necessary for the growth of the spirit. Thus, the best flowers of joy grow beside thorny roads. In time, new conditions will come into existence and the tasks will become broader. Possibly there will no longer be worries about earning a living, but there will be new problems, far more complicated and difficult. But if the Image of the Teacher lives in our hearts, can we worry about tomorrow! That which is considered the worst, from a human point of view, sometimes becomes our salvation and a step toward new possibilities. Verily, if our service is unselfish, not one hair will fall from our heads without the knowledge of the Great Teacher. Unselfish service, sincere devotion, and gratitude weave a strong thread by which all that is needful comes to us.\n\nThus, let us courageously meet the inevitable trials, and let us nurture the spirit through communion with seekers of Light. Events are ripening, one may expect many changes. But if we serve the great Light, the most destructive wave can only bear us upwards. Let us, therefore, in complete confidence in the Leading Hand create the light-bearing work.\n\n8\n\nI received your call and am ready to respond as far as is in my power. Spiritual help is indeed the highest, and I shall be happy if I can give you such help. However, a certain unification of consciousnesses and contact on the mental plane is quite essential. As it is said in the Teaching, “One may picture two conversationalists of approximately the same development who yet do not understand each other. Perhaps between their consciousnesses only a few small links are missing, yet this small difference forces the cogwheels of thinking to turn differently, with the result that altogether different levers are set in motion.” [New Era Community] Thus, I await your questions, for without questions there can be no answers.\n\nYou say, “Having suffered a deep spiritual disillusionment on my path, I have lost will and faith. Nevertheless, I still wait for the Teacher!” But if you wait, that means you have hope; therefore, faith is not yet lost, and this is most essential. Thus, let us go over your disappointments together and transmute them into accumulation of the great life experience, in the furnace of which our spiritual essence is conceived and strengthened. No theoretical knowledge, no philosophy can give you spirituality; only by drinking the cup of life’s poison, with all its illusions, can we accumulate the Chalice of Amrita.\n\nAnd so, I would like you to establish a clear point of view toward all disappointments. Should one be terrified by the destruction of illusions? Each broken illusion is another step of knowledge. True knowledge is austere, as is the spiritual path, and only the spiritually strong can hope to approach the path of accelerated spiritual development. Moreover, this path can never be eased, since only suffering, only personal tension can transmute our energies and give them the necessary balance. But blessed is he whose heart is aflame with the exaltation of heroic achievement; supernal joy becomes his lot. Thus, kindle all the fires of your heart, and exaltation of the spirit will be yours.\n\n9\n\nYou are right, it is most essential at present to think about podvig [The word podvig is untranslatable from the Russian. I means a great or heroic deed plus spiritual achievement.]—people should understand podvig in daily life. Life is meaningless without podvig. And how expressive is the Russian word podvig, indeed, it has no equivalent in European languages. In this word there is a whole sense, the whole quality of aspiring action forward toward self-sacrificing podvig, into the future, into evolution!\n\nI am happy to hear so many good reports about your book. I definitely know that it gave joy to all those who read it. The only obstacle is that our Russian readers are so very poor! But let nothing disturb you; just go ahead with your useful activities.\n\nDid you know that the year 1935 has been prolific in lunar and solar eclipses? Thus, the second half of June and the beginning of July brought three eclipses, and the last solar eclipse will take place in December, about Christmas time. Eclipses are always followed by cosmic perturbations and by all sorts of madnesses in the world. This explains the poor condition of my health during all of this year, although there have also been other weighty reasons for it. The true natures of people are now being revealed everywhere, and this could be called the purification of space. Of course, knowing the occult laws, in accordance with which our inner essence is revealed when we approach the Teaching and the Aura of the Great Teacher, and understanding the entire danger of infection by obsession, particularly in the case of inherent mediumship, we really should not be astonished. Nevertheless, great is our grief when we see how, under the dark hand of the obsessor, the flower of the spirit withers and terrible betrayal creeps into the very heart of the structure of Light. But we shall live through this also.\n\nThe year 1936 was mentioned in many prophecies as the year of the personal battle between the Archangel Michael and the Dragon. Thus, in spite of everything, courage and the joy of a new battle for Light abide in our hearts. And is podvig possible without difficulties? I am very fond of the words of the remarkable Tibetan sage, Milarepa, who practiced great austerities. When people begged him to have pity on himself and stop leading such a hard life, he said that as all of us are subject to death, he preferred to die in pursuit of a beautiful goal.\n\nVerily, if even one hundred people could realize the wisdom of this formula and would apply it in life, the world could be transformed in the shortest time. Thus, we shall fight for Light to the last drop of our blood, to our last breath. And you also should not be disturbed by anything. With flaming joy, take advantage of every possibility of contributing your share to the purification and improvement of human thinking.\n\n10\n\nMany miracles come into our life, many affirmations. Therefore even the darkest betrayals and attempts to ruin our works cannot frighten us. The years 1934 and especially 1935 with their seven lunar and solar eclipses were quite exceptional in the number of dark omens. Thus, betrayal crept into the very heart of a luminous structure with an attempt to destroy what had been built by such pure striving and such flaming spirit. The enemy took advantage of the absence of N. K. and thrust the dagger at his back. Now the masks have fallen and the true faces are revealed. Of course we should not be astonished, for we know the immutable occult laws, under which when we approach the Teaching of Light and turn to the Great Teachers, our whole inner nature is revealed with a special force. Likewise, we know how liable to the danger of obsession one becomes if one allows oneself to give in to dark thoughts and insincerity, particularly when there is inherent mediumship. And yet, the heart grieves when we encounter such actions after fourteen years of close collaboration. Of course, at the very beginning of our work we received many repeated warnings and hints about a betrayal that might come after the promotion of certain people. The promotion took place, and their spirit failed. Ambition and cupidity are dreadful scourges—even giants are cast down precipices by them.\n\nAnd so, we drink the chalice of poison tendered by the hands of our former co-workers. But in spite of this, strength and courage live in our hearts. For what is achievement without betrayal? The symbol of Judas is eternal and is inevitably present at the consummation of a great achievement. But after Golgotha comes the resurrection and the great exaltation of the spirit. This was indicated in all the Mysteries, therefore, even joy is aflame in our hearts. We know the Great Pledge of the Stronghold of Light, we measure the signs of Trust, and we know the victorious Shield. Our spirit cannot be frightened by any battles; we even have learned to love them, because what else can so temper the spirit and test our abilities and bring us great experience for the crown of fulfillment? And so, we may once more say, “Blessed are the obstacles; by them we grow.”\n\nWe can also recall the wise words of Nietzsche, “Thou goest beyond them; but the higher thou risest, the smaller doth the eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is the flying one hated.” Yes, at the present time, people revolt particularly against everything lofty, and against the law of Hierarchy. Only the kings of the spirit are aware of all the grandeur and immutability of this cosmic law, the majority always rise against it. Indeed, the refinement of the spirit is indicated precisely by its ability to revere lofty values.\n\nAnd so, courageously and joyously we begin the new battle for the Light of the new consciousness in the coming era with complete confidence in the predestined final victory.\n\nI received with joy the wonderful message of your heart, in which you expressed your devotion to the Great Teacher. Verily, devotion is a quality characteristic only of kings of the spirit. It is quite obvious that you have brought this rarest quality from your past. Where else but in the East, and possibly in blessed India, should one seek the inception of this highest of qualities! All the spiritual achievements, her spiritual education, and the most refined ethics of India are based on this fundamental quality. The entire literature of India is saturated by the spirit of heroism and devotion. Nowhere are the links between Guru and disciple more understood and sacredly revealed than in India. Even during the temporary decline of the country, this reverence was preserved in the very heart of the people, and it gives a particular ineradicable coating to the innate culture of the Indian spirit. Thus, blessed are you if your heart vibrates to this great feeling of sweet savor. Verily, the fires of gratitude and devotion rise higher than those of any other offerings.\n\nI shall conclude with the words of the Teaching: “Swimmers, if you do everything possible within your strength, whither can the most destructive wave carry you? It can only bear you upwards.” Thus we shall pass, under the Great Shield of the Hierarchy of Light.\n\n11\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. The non-consuming fire, the burning bush of Moses, is the so-called heavenly fire, which can be manifested only when there is contact with an aura of certain tension. N. K. and I witnessed such fire during our journeying in Tibet. Once, late in the evening, this fiery phenomenon occurred in our tent quite unexpectedly. My husband was already asleep. I came to my bed and stretched out my arm to turn down the blanket, and suddenly there arose a pillar, or rather a fire of wonderful silvery-purple-rose-flame. At first I did not realize what was happening, and with an exclamation, “Fire! Fire!” attempted to beat it out with my hands. But the fire was not extinguished, nor did the tongues of flame burn my hands, and I felt only a pleasant living warmth. Hearing my voice, my husband awoke and saw me standing against the background of this flame. The whole incident did not last more than a quarter of a minute, perhaps less, and the flame disappeared just as suddenly as it appeared. After this manifestation I saw the crystals of Materia Lucida and spirals, and the sparks of Fohat. However, these latter experiences resulted in a slight singeing of the centers.\n\n2. The seventh principle is the element of synthesis, but it is not the higher Ego of man.\n\nThe higher Ego consists of three principles; the seventh, the sixth, and the fifth. I am enclosing a short note that I wrote to one of my co-workers. Perhaps you will find it useful.\n\n3. The moon is our mother—it took part in the formation of our Earth and in populating it with human beings. The Lunar Monads, or pitris—the ancestors, as they are called by the Hindus, became incarnated in our human kind. The moon will disappear or disintegrate before the seventh great Round of our planet.\n\n4. Almost all of the sciences originated in India. Egypt, Greece, and ancient Chaldea borrowed their knowledge from India. Similarly, Osiris, Hermes, and Orpheus came from the East; also, Pythagoras received his initiation in India.\n\n5. There is a complete correspondence between the subtle and physical bodies. Therefore, each physical center has its correspondence in the subtle body. Consequently, all the astral feelings and centers exist just as do the physical ones, but in their subtle radiations. Yet they should not be considered separately, because their unity reveals a strict correspondence. The outer world is a mere reflection of the inner one. And just as the external feelings and energies are manifested only when the necessary conditions exist, so also the inner, spiritual energies are manifested when the astral or spiritual conditions are created on the inner plane.\n\n6. Christ always felt a loss of strength when purifying and healing the sick. Remember, when a sick woman in the crowd touched the hem of His garment, He immediately felt a decrease of strength. A great spirit imparts part of his strength each time he heals, each time someone touches him. And no matter how great is the supply of psychic energy, it can be temporarily exhausted. These moments of exhaustion are full of danger, because the protective net of the aura, bereft of those radiations from the store of radiations which nourishes our centers, is disturbed, and infectious microbes are able to enter the weakest area of the organism. This explains why Agni Yoga is so full of indications regarding the preservation of the protective net. A disciple who has reached a certain degree of Yoga is unable to remain indefinitely in the polluted atmosphere of cities; he often has to leave to lead a more or less secluded life amidst nature.\n\nChrist, like Buddha and all other Great Teachers, often went into the desert.\n\nAlso, in The Mahatma Letters we find mention of a serious illness of the Mahatma K. H., after having contacted the auras of people, during the time of the founding of the Theosophical Society in India. He was compelled to retire into complete seclusion for several weeks. Thus, each plane of consciousness, each plane of existence is subject to certain laws, which, if violated bring their own consequences.\n\nIf you wish, you could mention that the doctrine of reincarnation was repudiated only in A.D. 553, during the Second Council of Constantinople. Thus, the doctrine regarding the pre-existence of the soul and its continuous return to Earth was declared “heresy” by official Christendom only in the sixth century A.D. Until that time it was tolerated and accepted by those churchmen who were particularly close to the Gnostics.\n\nAnd now, just for your information, I will tell you of an interesting case of a recollection from a previous life. It happened in the eighties of the last century and was written down from the narrative of one of the participants. A lady who lived on an estate in the province of Pskov, accompanied by her husband and son, went on a visit for the Christmas holidays to a distant estate, belonging to some friends. They started out on a wonderful sunny morning, hoping to arrive before dark. However, after midday the weather changed sharply; it became stormy, the snow fell heavily, visibility became difficult, and in about half an hour the road entirely disappeared under the heavy snow. It was already dark, but there was no sign of any habitation, in spite of the fact that normally they should have arrived long ago. The road became full of holes, and the carriage was in danger of overturning. It was obvious that they had lost their way. However, it would have been very unwise to stop and wait until the weather cleared up, because the storm was growing stronger and stronger, and the horses and carriage would have been buried under the heavy snowfall. It was therefore decided to continue the journey and to trust the horses to use their own instinct. The moment the clever animals were permitted freedom, they understood what was expected of them; they lifted their heads, sniffed the air, and increased speed. In an hour or less the distant barking of dogs could be heard, and soon they saw a few lights and the carriage reached the stone gates of a big estate. A servant, hearing the barking of the dogs, came out with a lantern. When asked whose estate it was, he gave the name and added that the owners were abroad at the time. The travelers found that they were in the opposite direction from their destination. As it was already late, they decided they must stay at the estate. They called for the major-domo and asked him to open the house in order that they might stay overnight. But when the lady alighted from the carriage and saw the house, dimly lit by the servants’ lanterns, she began to tremble and exclaimed in terror. “Never will I set foot in that house. Dreadful things have happened there!” She begged her husband to immediately leave this unhappy place. The husband and son were astonished beyond measure, and thinking that over-fatigue was the cause of her nervousness tried to calm her and convince her that she was mistaken, since none of them had ever before been in these parts. However, the lady was insistent upon leaving, and in order to prove her reasons, she said, “I can describe to you the situation of the rooms and also the furniture. When you enter the circular red sitting room, you will see on the wall above a table a large portrait of a woman, in a white dress, with flowers in her hands. Well, that was my own portrait. And … I was so terribly, terribly unhappy!” Of course, the husband and the son, accompanied by the major-domo, went immediately to check this statement. They returned greatly shaken, for the description was precisely correct. They did not insist further upon staying in the unfortunate house, and since the storm had abated, and the moon had come out, they asked for a guide, deciding to return home.\n\nSuch recollections are rather frequent in the East. Newspapers mention these cases, which are corroborated by numerous witnesses. We know a local family, a member of which, a boy five years old insists to his parents that he is not their son and that he was formerly a monk and lived in a monastery. He often runs away from the house and searches for this monastery. Sometimes he manages to travel far before his parents notice his absence. Invariably, he sets out for Little Tibet.\n\n12\n\n1. In reality, man cannot rid himself completely of karma, for karma is life. But the fulfillment of a cycle of karma, of whatever duration, depends upon our spiritual growth, and also on the mission we have undertaken upon a certain planet. This means that, having acquired a certain knowledge of the Teaching, and after an interval of time (a vacation, so to say), we have to commence the next, higher degree, and so on ad infinitum. These “vacations” may be that very place of rest, where there are no “tears or sighs.” But no vacation continues forever, though it may be prolonged for thousands of years, therefore there is no eternal “rest.”\n\n2. There is a continuous birth and disintegration of worlds in the Cosmos. Often, the worlds that are disintegrating are still far from the completion of their evolution, and there are many reasons for their destruction. One of the most deplorable reasons is the benumbed spirit of the humanity that inhabits a planet. And our Earth is in danger of destruction before completing its ordained evolution. The crimes of people and their numbness of spirit have created such emanations around our planet that the salutary rays are unable to reach it. Our planet may end its existence with a gigantic explosion. The final Day of Judgment is not far off, and many children may live to see that DAY. That is why the giving of the Teaching of Life has been so hastened, and why so many unusual omens are being rained upon Earth. But people are blind and deaf!\n\nIt is essential to awaken the human spirit! Verily, the destiny of the planet is in the hands of humanity itself! If the resurrection of the spirit takes place within the next short decades, the inevitable catastrophe may be only partial, as it was in the times of Lemuria and Atlantis; otherwise, we shall have to move to another planet. But in accordance with the laws of correspondence and co-measurement the majority of mankind will not be admitted to the higher planets, which are already populated. They will have to adjust themselves to a new world, which is not yet inhabited. And how many thousands, nay, millions of years would have to elapse before the new forms and bodies suitable for a new world could be worked out. Only exceptional groups of earthly humanity could enter the higher planets to continue their evolution in new, beautiful conditions.\n\nThe Great Brotherhood is taking extraordinary measures to save our planet from premature destruction. But the subterranean fire is most active, and the forces that can be discharged to neutralize the dangerous energy are pitifully small! Of course, there is no such thing in the Cosmos as irrational destruction; everything is based on profound reasons. Great GOAL-FITNESS rules in the Cosmos; all that is unable to proceed with evolution is churned over as cosmic refuse. Thus, having free will man chooses this or that destiny. And still, man zealously piles up heaps of rubbish which will engulf him if a regeneration of his spirit does not take place in time.\n\n3. It is useful to give certain hints regarding a new program for schools. Precisely, from childhood the consciousness should be trained to realize the unity of life, the unity in Cosmos. Let our planet not be some isolated world, but rather, one of the halting places on the great Path into Infinity. We must realize our place in Infinity, as well as our dependence upon the complete unity of life in Cosmos—and the sooner, the better. Remember how it is said in the Teaching, “Verily, a feather falling from the wing of a small bird produces a thunderclap in the far-off worlds.” We must realize most intensely our awesome dependence and interrelation with everything in life. Thence should come a sense of great responsibility for each thought, word and action. Cause and effect act continuously and infinitely.\n\nSomeday, the consciousness of mankind will reach the point where it realizes that it exists in a gigantic Universal Laboratory and is a reflection of it. Truly, unity must be understood on a cosmic scale.\n\nLikewise, it is useful to direct thoughts into the future. This alone will give a great impetus to the consciousness and will liberate it from the dust of yesterday.\n\n4. Imperil is the designation given by the Great Teachers to the poison of irritability, however in the Eastern tongues there is an entirely different word for this poison. The sacred Senzar language consists of the best definitives, adopted from all existing languages. Many words with a Latin root are used in this language. Thus, imperil has a definite Latin Root. There are some words which have no link with any language known to us. Often a single word expresses a complex idea or action.\n\n5. No one, not even the Greatest Spirits, possess complete omnipotence. They are all subject to the cosmic laws; hence, They can apply Their great knowledge and power when the cosmic conditions are favorable. Each miracle performed without a fundamental reason is considered by the Arhats to be a violation. It is said, “Even an Arhat can descend, by misuse of miracle.”\n\nOf course, the conditions existing at the time of Christ (just as at the present time) rarely contributed toward the possibility of a miracle. Therefore even Christ was not always able to cure those who came to him for help. In the Gospel of St. Matthew (13:58) it is said, “And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.” Thus, that which is desired is given only to him who is able to accept it. In everything cooperation and collaboration are required.\n\n6. I would like you even more strongly to emphasize work as the main factor in the education of the spirit. Point out that quality is the most essential in all work. Also mention that mental work is absolutely necessary; for if the sweat of physical labor nourishes the soil, the sweat of mental work is similarly transmuted by the rays of the sun into prana and gives life to all that exists. If the significance of mental work is realized, there will follow a proper respect for all thinkers, scientists, and other creators.\n\nOnly mental work broadens our consciousness, thereby linking us with the far-off worlds and the whole Cosmos, and turning us to the joy of infinite perfectment. Precisely, we should cultivate in ourselves the joy of endless perfectment.\n\nYour chapter about striving is quite good. It would be useful to connect this striving still more closely with the concept of podvig by introducing this idea as the sole meaning of life. Much is said about podvig in the books of the Teaching. Indeed, only podvig can nourish our spirit and accelerate evolution. Indeed, achievement and heroism must be thoroughly taught in schools. “Let children call themselves heroes and apply to themselves the qualities of remarkable people. Let them be given books of clear account, wherein the faces of toil and of will have been depicted without any soft coatings. Even for medicinal purposes this valiant call of life is irreplaceable. Such material must be given without delay.” [New Era Community]\n\nUse more broadly the quotations from the books of the Teaching, it will give newness to the book.\n\n7. One must not think that the next Great Teacher will appear in the flesh and will preach among us, as did Buddha and Christ. Each epoch requires its own manifestations. Therefore, the type of Teacher who walks with a group of disciples from village to village has sunk into oblivion. Some Elder Brothers still use the physical body for special purposes, but not for encountering crowds.\n\nI had to write on this subject before, therefore I will quote from one of my previous letters: “The Great Advent cannot be manifested in an ordinary way, and it cannot take place in the physical body. One should understand that the Great Lords take on or maintain this or that Image, according to the needs of the world. Why is it so difficult to imagine that a Great Individuality does not require a physical body to manifest very close to us? Moreover, the facts of the past, with examples in modern times show how strangely the appearance of Great Spirits is taken by ignorant humans. At best they have been given the epithet of charlatan or spy, or both. Generally, people attribute their own vices to others. It would be most edifying to read the historical facts of the life of Saint-Germain, the envoy of the White Brotherhood.”\n\nWe can also recall H. P. Blavatsky, and all the appearances of the Mahatmas. How skeptically and often scoffingly were their messages and manifestations received! But, as I have already written, “Even if Christ Himself appeared now among us, would He be able to escape imprisonment, or even execution? … One must realize that the Greatest Individuality cannot be manifested now, in the midst of chaotic thinking and the vibrations of depraved crowds. The Great Lords apply in everything the great law of GOAL-FITNESS. Please realize that in view of the level of contemporary humanity, the Advent of the Highest Ego in a physical form is entirely impossible and would be disastrous for the whole of evolution. The Great Individuality—invisibly visible—will rule, and is already ruling, garbed in the Rays of the powerful but invisible LABORATORY.” Soon, very soon, these Rays will be directed to the awakening of the spirit of humanity.\n\n“According to the most ancient testaments, the Lord of Shambhala is fighting the Prince of Darkness (Satan) himself. This battle, first of all, takes place in the subtle spheres; whereas, here the Lord of Shambhala acts through his earthly warriors. As for Himself, He can be seen only in the most exceptional cases. As for His manifesting in a Fiery Image, this would be disastrous for all and everything, as His aura is charged with energies of extraordinary power. In the Gospel of St. Matthew (24:27-39) the Advent and Judgment Day awaiting our planet are described fairly accurately. However, you will have plenty of time to grow old before this event, but partial catastrophes may take place sooner.”\n\nWe are witnessing a great world-reconstruction. New laws are already written into the Tables of Eternity, but the great Revelation is not yet accepted. Woe to those who reject the spirit and who prefer to vegetate in ignorance, in debility, and in moral mire! The New World comes in realization of human dignity, in austere understanding of duty and the responsibility of each one to humanity and the whole of Cosmos. Cooperation always and in everything must become the order of the Day.\n\n13\n\nProbably, you too must have noticed at times that the gates of possibilities are often very narrow. Indeed, in many cases the difficulty is not so much in the shortage of funds as that the magnitude of the work outgrows the consciousness of the co-workers. Yes, everywhere there is a shortage of people. What we need is an increase of strong workers, who are not afraid of bold undertakings.\n\nLet the fireflies glow, if they be not caught in the nets of paltry hunters and thus betray the work. Uttering lofty words is one thing, but applying them in life is something entirely different; usually these two actions do not go together. Furthermore, I greatly dislike it when someone says that he is ready to give his life for the Teaching! In most cases, almost invariably, this is the greatest lie.\n\nDuring my whole life, I have met only two or three people who were really ready to sacrifice everything; but precisely they refrained from giving assurances—they acted. Others came and donated because they had a surplus, or for profit when they heard that each gift is returned a hundredfold. But when this “hundredfold” was not forthcoming as expected, or it was delayed because of their own fault, they turned into the worst enemies and betrayers of the work. Often they would turn away at the final boundary. There were also those who were ready to sacrifice just one half, even when events required that everything be laid at stake. But can one expect success from halfway decisions? Can one expect a cure from medicine given in half doses? Of course, success in these cases was also halved. However, the most remarkable is that the second half, held back because of petty fears, was later taken away either by karma or some unexpected circumstances. There is still a third and most prevalent kind of people, who imagine that their very approach to the Teaching is already the greatest favor on their part. In their conceit, they believe that the Mahatmas are ready to perform a puja to everyone who approaches or even has read their Teaching. Not so! The Great Teachers rejoice and render active help only to those who truly strive. They are sorry for the butterflies, for They know that these butterflies must pass through centuries of difficulties before they can hope to approach the Stronghold of Light. It would be useful for such people to read the following pages from the Teaching:\n\n“Someone will say: ‘Is vigilance, or co-measurement, or mobility, or devotion difficult? Here, I feel that I can contain all these conditions; will you not take me on the distant journey into the COMMUNITY?’ [Emphasis added.] But has this hasty traveler thought about a certain requisite in the qualities mentioned by him? Steadfastness was forgotten. Little fires flickering only for an instant contain all the qualities of flame, but darkness engulfs them as swiftly as a brazier does a snowflake. One cannot trust an isolated moment of containment; only STEADFASTNESS [Emphasis added], tempered by toil and by obstacles, results in a trustworthy containment. A true musician does not think about each finger’s calling forth a sound; only a pupil considers which fingers are convenient to use. The true co-worker does not think about the intended application of the qualities of labor. The music of the spheres is blended with the song of progress of labor. Ponder how like a fiery ladder is STEADFASTNESS.” [Emphasis added]\n\n“Someone decides: ‘I will cross upon the fiery ladder.’ Do so, to each one the path is open. But remember, if fear comes the steps melt into liquid flame. Whither will you go, not having acquired the quality of labor? When We say it is better to sleep on cedar roots, the follower can carry out easily the advice. It is easy to sleep, and especially when so advised. But when one is told to take up constant watch, then the steps become burning hot. One thing must be repeated: not easy is the ladder. Poor is the leader who conceals real danger. It can be conquered only with the help of complete knowledge. I see approaching another unreasonable person—this one is still more imperfect. He censures: ‘Of what use is a solemn prophecy?’ We shall say, ‘The solemnity of a forewarning is proportionate to the degradation of your squeaking at danger. O thou biped, how many times you have lost your face at the first difficulty! We have seen you blacker than charcoal, and your negation has filled you with stench. Badly do you fare, having burned your steps and now asking alms of the abyss.’ A new interrogator: ‘How to reconcile the Teaching with science?’ If science teaches authentic knowledge, then the Teaching is science. What purpose can science achieve when it is swollen with prejudices? He who is perturbed by solemnity of affirmations views science from his den of vulgarity. He who thinks about the community is not harmed by crawling reptiles. I say to you that I know all the complexity of the construction. I do not conceal how far the stones must be carried nor how great is the aridity. Precisely this realization, precisely the countlessness of the stars, gives affirmation to the fiery steps.” [New Era Community]\n\nDifficult is the path of true discipleship. Indeed, there is no knowledge, no philosophy and, moreover, no violation by magic that can give us spirituality. For only by experiencing life, by drinking the poison of all life’s illusions, by preserving ardent aspiration for the service of the General Good can we fill the CHALICE of AMRITA.\n\nI was sorry to read that there is still someone who admires mediumistic faculties, calling them achievements. In the Teaching, and in the East generally, this condition is considered rather a misfortune; I have written in detail about the danger of it. Think of the definitions of mediumship given in the book Agni Yoga: “mediums are like rudderless boats. … A medium is but the inn for disembodied liars.” Indeed, it is not just any kind of clairvoyance that indicates the transmutation of the centers. Actually, high clairvoyance has nothing in common with mediumship. The very character of the visions described by Mrs. X testifies to her contact with the lower astral spheres. Genuine clairvoyance is accompanied by beauty, grandeur, and simplicity, but not by piles of rubbish. Also, the environment in which her abilities were developed proves that we are dealing precisely with mediumship and not with open centers. Believe me, open centers are rare indeed, and the Great Lords, who watch over the evolution of humanity, guard carefully from early childhood those individuals who have earned the right to possess open centers. They are placed by Them in favorable environments, where they can better develop and express their gifts. But the Great Teachers will never approach a person who lives amidst the fumes of alcohol and charges money for telling fortunes. This would be an outrageous profanation of sacred knowledge and of the hidden achievements of the spirit.\n\nTherefore, the only help that can be given to Mrs. X is the advice to give up all books on magic and cease fortune-telling, etc. Let her work more, and read the books of the Teaching of Life, which should be explained to her. But most of all she should purify herself spiritually. She should forbid herself to pay attention to calls from the astral world, and instead focus her attention and heart on the Image of the chosen Teacher.\n\nThe present condition of the Great Teacher is such that He does not manifest himself to anyone. This condition may be compared to the tension of a dynamo of tremendous power. Yet His help may come in the most unexpected way “through human hands and feet.” In the astral world there are plenty of impersonators and good actors, and this should always be remembered. Let Mrs. X read The Voice of Silence by H. P. Blavatsky. The dangers of the astral world are described there quite clearly.\n\nThus, the Great Teaching of Light has in view the correct growth of the human spirit, but not the development of mediumistic abilities, which cannot lead to anything, but can only retard the spiritual growth, and even become destructive. And as nothing mechanical can be built into the foundation of true evolution or progress, I once again advise Mrs. X to give up all books that deal with the development of clairvoyance, etc. In the near future, when humanity shall have advanced in the understanding of the still hidden laws of the subtle energies, the possibility will come of utilizing mediums for certain scientific researches. Such mediums will have to live a very pure life, and methods will be found for protecting them and also those who come in contact with them. But at present contact with a medium may even be dangerous for those who are near him if they possess unstable auras.\n\nExplain to her how harmful is concentration upon one particular center, as recommended in books written by irresponsible authors. This concentration stimulates that center at the expense of all others, and thus casts the entire scheme of their polarization into chaos. This process is truly disastrous to the vibrations, since it violates the balance of the established vibratory scheme. Remember what is said in the Teaching regarding the work of the Teacher with the disciples on all centers and on all the seven circles of clairvoyance and clairaudience. The Teacher watches closely the condition of the pupil’s organism, and never would He open one center at the expense of another. Correct development or evolution exists only in harmony or balance.\n\nAnd now regarding automatic writing. This, too, is considered to be a certain degree of obsession, for in automatic writing there is usually an external influence upon the physical center of the hand, and even that of the brain, which is most harmful and, if practiced often, can end in paralysis.\n\nI have never written automatically, but I had a chance to observe this phenomenon in America, where it is widespread. The process differs: Some declare that they are not aware of what is written by their hand, whereas others say that each word is clearly impressed upon their brain. Some write very quickly, even violently, others, very quietly, carefully drawing each word. Some write with sudden changes of language; some, without having the slightest technique for drawing a simple object, suddenly sketch complete pictures. There are also cases of people writing from right to left, in an unknown language. Of course, all these do not issue from the subconscious, but obviously result from external influence. And the degrees of the “Guardian Angels,” who wish to guide and communicate, certainly vary in the Subtle World. Through those who are harmless and friendly to us, we may, quite unexpectedly, attract a hostile force and one of not a small caliber. Therefore, I advise that automatic writing be avoided until a heartfelt bond with the Teacher has been affirmed. We can never tell who may wish to use us as their tools! And besides we can attract a force which is later beyond our capacity to control. So let each one seriously ponder before opening the way to unknown forces. If there is devotion to the Teaching, and a talent for writing, what need is there of automatic writing? For the writer the Teaching provides an inexhaustible source of themes.\n\nOnly spirituality and podvig advance us toward the loftiest achievement, that of Arhatship. If Mrs. X would become firm on the right path, she would really be able to help people. But in her present condition she is able only to open the doors to the lower strata of the Subtle World and to involve unfortunate victims in the dangers of obsession. There is nothing more deceptive than the visions from the Subtle World. Verily, little knowledge and partial truth are more dangerous than complete ignorance. Therefore, be compassionate, but do not be enticed by mediums; and above all, try not to see them as privileged beings!\n\nI shall quote a page from The Occult Anatomy of Man by Manly P. Hall, a talented American interpreter of occult knowledge: “It will probably be wise at this point to describe the difference between a medium and a clairvoyant. To the average person there is no difference, but to the mystic these two phases of spiritual sight are separated by t"
