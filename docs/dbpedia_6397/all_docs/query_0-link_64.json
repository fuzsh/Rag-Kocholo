        "meta_description": "I did my PhD from Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India in 2011 on properties and applications of Ionic Liquids. Following that I spent 18 months as JSPS postdoctoral fellow at Kyushu University, Japan in the research group of Prof. Nobuo Kimizuka. In December, 2012, I joined Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India as Assistant Professor of Chemistry. My research interests includeÂ Molecular self-assembly and dynamics of ionic liquids (ILs) in aqueous and non-aqueous media, Self-assembly of surfactants in Ionic Liquids, Behavior of proteins in aqueous IL solutions, Nano-structured materials using ILs, Ion-Gels, Thermo-physical properties and utilization of binary mixtures of ILs, Functional ILs for sustainable energy, Micro-emulsions, Ionic Liquids and Photo-catalysis under sun-light etc.",
