        "meta_description": "Background A quarter of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) were asymptomatic, and only a third of them survived at the end of 4 years. Only a select subset of these patients was recommended for aortic valve replacement (AVR) by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. We intended to study the effect of early AVR (eAVR) in this subset of asymptomatic patients with preserved left ventricle function.\n\nMethods and results We searched PubMed and Embase for randomised and observational studies comparing the effect of eAVR versus conservative therapy in patients with severe, asymptomatic AS and normal left ventricular function. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (study defined), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiac death, sudden death, the development of symptoms, heart failure hospitalisations and major bleeding. We used GRADEPro to assess the certainty of the evidence. In the randomised controlled trial (RCT) only analysis, we found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the early aortic intervention group versus the conservative arm (CA) (incidence rate ratio, IRR (CI): 0.5 (0.2 to 1.1), I2=31%, p=0.09). However, in the overall cohort, we found mortality benefit for eAVR over CA (IRR (CI): 0.4 (0.3 to 0.7), I2=84%, p<0.01). There were significantly lower MACE, cardiac death, sudden death, development of symptoms and heart failure hospitalisations in the eAVR group. We noticed no difference in MI, stroke and major bleeding.\n\nConclusion We conclude that there is no reduction in all-cause mortality in the eAVR arm in patients with asymptomatic AS with preserved ejection fraction. However, eAVR reduces heart failure related hospitalisations and death or heart failure hospitalisations.\n\nPROSPERO registration number CRD42022306132.\n\nData are available in a public, open access repository.

        "text": "Introduction\n\nAortic valve replacement (AVR) is the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) or who have developed left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. According to a recent study, one-fourth of patients with severe AS will be asymptomatic.1 The natural history of asymptomatic severe AS could be as bad as some malignancies with poor long-term prognosis. Such elderly patients with severe AS may be under-reporting symptoms because of poor mobility, degenerative arthritis, frailty and memory disturbances. Hence, one should be prudent before declaring these patients as ‘asymptomatic’. The event-free survival rates in age<70 years with asymptomatic severe AS were 82%, 70%, 46% and 37% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively.2 The 4-year event-free survival rate of conservatively managed asymptomatic severe AS in elderly patients (age>70 years) was 16%, whereas in very severe AS it was only 6%.2 The risk of sudden death reported in asymptomatic severe AS was 1%–1.5% per year.3 Hence, early AVR (eAVR) may confer beneficial effects in selected patients with asymptomatic severe AS. Prior observational studies and meta-analyses of such studies have shown the beneficial effects of early surgery in such patients.3–9 The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline suggests that AVR may be considered in such asymptomatic severe AS in the following situations: (1) when an exercise test demonstrated a reduced exercise tolerance or fall in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg, (2) when the brain-natriuretic peptide is elevated, (3) when the patient has a very critical AS (peak velocity more than 5 m/s), (4) when there is a progressive reduction in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) to less than 60% documented in at least three serial imaging studies and (5) when a rapid progression of aortic disease (>0.3 m/s per year) is observed.10 The European Society of Cardiology suggests that patients with asymptomatic severe AS may be considered for eAVR based on a clinical, echocardiographic and biomarker-based approach.11 However, two recently published randomised studies suggest that earlier AVR may benefit asymptomatic patients.12 13 We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of early intervention either in the form of surgical AVR (SAVR) or transcatheter AVR (TAVR) or implantation in patients with asymptomatic, severe AS with preserved LV function.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy inclusion criteria\n\nStudies with the patient population described below were included. Patients with isolated, severe AS who were\n\nAsymptomatic.\n\nWho had normal LV systolic function (LV ejection fraction>55%).\n\nStudied should have compared isolated SAVR or TAVR (early surgery group) with medical therapy alone (conservative or wait and watch strategy). We did not keep any time restriction for eAVR. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies with at least one outcome, as described below, were included. Any study with less than 25 patients in each group was excluded. Any study where more than 10% of patients received CABG or other valve surgery was excluded. Case reports, reviews, comments, editorials, letters or unreported studies were excluded. If more than one study is from the same institute, we proposed to include the one with the longest follow-up with largest sample size or more than one would be included if the methodology clearly excludes the other study population. The study protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022306132).\n\nSearch strategy, eligibility assessment, data extraction and validity assessment\n\nWe searched for all studies on patients with asymptomatic, severe AS (since inception to January 2022) in the PubMed and Embase. We confined ourselves to the English literature. Also, we looked for cross-references in the screened studies, review articles and prior similar meta-analyses along with conference proceedings to identify studies that can be potentially included.\n\nWe followed the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement’ in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies identified through the databases were incorporated into a single file using ‘Rayyan’ which is a free, online application to assist researchers with systematic review methodology and meta-analysis projects. Screening of the studies was initially performed using the title and abstracts after eliminating the duplicates by two independent authors. The full texts of the screened articles were systematically evaluated for their eligibility. We proposed to extract baseline characteristics of patients, procedural details and clinical outcomes from the included studies. Once extracted, included, the data was used for qualitative data synthesis. Two independent physicians (NVS and HS) extracted the data, while NBS helped in resolving issues between them. Quantitative data analysis was done for all outcomes whenever two studies’ data were available.\n\nRisk-of-bias (quality) assessment\n\nWe used the ‘Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials V.2 (RoB 2)’ to assess the risk of bias in the RCTs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for observational studies to assess the quality of non-randomised studies. We used the ‘Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach’ to calculate ‘certainty of evidence’. Furthermore, the GRADEPro guideline development tool created a summary of findings table and a GRADE ‘evidence profile’.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (study defined MACE was selected as different studies might have used different criteria to define MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiac death, sudden death, the development of symptoms, heart failure hospitalisations, major bleeding (as described by the study) and death or heart failure hospitalisations.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe performed a random effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird method with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) as the summary measure for the primary (all-cause mortality) and several secondary outcomes, as described above. We used the I² statistic to assess heterogeneity where low, moderate and high heterogeneity were defined as 0%–25%, 25%–50% and >50%, respectively. If the studies included were found to have varying durations of follow-up, a simple pooling of the relative risk or OR was likely to be biased and strongly discouraged.14 In order to account for differing follow-up duration between the studies, we used IRR as the summary measure, which takes person-time as the denominator. Group-specific total follow-up duration (person-time) was extracted wherever it was reported, and where it was not available, we multiplied the average follow-up duration with the sample size.15 For each outcome, pooled estimates of IRR were provided separately for randomised controlled trials and observational studies. As a sensitivity analysis, fixed effects model for IRR was also provided alongside random effects estimates, and for the primary outcome, reported HRs of the included studies were pooled and compared using methods described previously.16 Subgroup analyses were performed for the following groups: RCT versus observational study, older studies (before 2011) versus recent studies (after 2011), small studies (sample size less than 200 in each group) versus large studies (sample size>200 patients in each group were defined as a large study), the length of accumulated follow-up patient-time (<200 vs ≥200 patient-years) and mean LVEF 50%–55% versus LVEF more than 55%. All subgroups were tested for statistical interaction using random effects meta-regression. If more than one study had not described the outcome, the outcome was not analysed. the A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We performed all the analyses using R V.4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Review Manager V.5.3 (the Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).\n\nResults\n\nOur search strategy resulted in 3098 studies. After the exclusion of duplicates and inclusion of articles from references, we ended up screening 2982 studies. After excluding 2936 which did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, we had 46 articles for full-text screening. We excluded 40 articles for various reasons as elucidated (figure 1) and included relevant studies from references. We ended up having seven manuscripts for the final quantitative data analysis.\n\nCharacteristics of the included studies with their risk-of-bias assessment\n\nWe had seven studies for our final analyses. Two were randomised control trials, while the rest were observational studies. Based on the arbitrarily defined classification, as discussed before, we found six large studies, six recent studies and five of the studies had >200 patient-year follow-ups.\n\nRoB 2 based risk-of-bias (RoB) for the primary outcome showed low risk and some concern among the RCTs (online supplemental table 1), while all observational studies showed good quality when assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Score (NOS) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Score (online supplemental table 2).\n\nSupplemental material\n\nAmong the included studies, the definition of severe AS, their primary outcome and the definition of early surgery varied (table 1). We studied 2889 patients from seven studies in the final analysis, with 766 patients in the early surgery group and 2123 patients in the conservative group. The baseline characteristics of the studied population are shown in table 1.\n\nClinical outcomes\n\nWe studied 1300.3 patient-years follow-up available in the RCT studies group with 632 patient-years in the eAVR group versus 668.3 patient-years in the conservative one. Fewer events were noticed in the RCTs (14 ad 31, respectively, in the eAVR and conservative groups). However, we found no difference in the all-cause mortality between the early aortic intervention group versus the conservative arm (CA) (IRR (CI): 0.5 (0.2 to 1.1), I2=31%, p=0.09, figure 2; central illustration; GRADEPro level evidence: high; online supplemental table 3). In the overall cohort analysis, we studied a total patient-year follow-up of 20 329.5 patient-years with 5056.5 patient-years follow-up in the eAVR group and 15 273 patient-years follow-up in the conservative group. The all-cause mortality in the total group (summation of the results of RCT and observational studies) was observed in 187 patients in the eAVR group as compared with 1140 patients in the conservative group that were significantly significant favouring eAVR as compared with CA (IRR (CI): 0.4 (0.3 to 0.7), I2=84%, p<0.01; GRADEPro level of evidence: cannot be done). The sensitivity analysis done using the fixed effects model and leave-one study out analyses (both fixed and random effects model) also showed similar results favouring eAVR (IRR (CI): 0.6 (0.5 to 0.7), online supplemental figures 1–3). We analysed 3464.5 patient-years in the eAVR versus 11 200 patient-year in the conservative groups in the subgroup analysis restricted to observational studies. On the contrary to the above results from the RCTs, there was a significant association between eAVR and reduced mortality with very high heterogeneity (IRR (CI): 0.4 (0.2 to 0.8), I2=89%, p<0.01; GRADEPro level evidence: very low; figure 2 and online supplemental table 4). We performed a subgroup analysis that showed no difference for all-cause mortality by the study size and period of study with the test of the difference between groups (online supplemental figures 4 and 5). Publication bias, as assessed by the funnel plot, showed potential publication bias (online supplemental figure 6) .\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nThere was no reduction in the MI in the eAVR group (IRR (CI): 0.3 (0.1 to 2.0); I2=0%; p=0.22; GRADEPro evidence for RCT: high level; figure 3 and online supplemental tables 4 and 5). Also, we observed no reduction in stroke (IRR (CI): 0.8 (0.2 to 3.0); I2=0%; p=0.75; GRADEPro evidence: low level; figure 3 and online supplemental tables 3 and 4). We found a significantly reduced number of development of symptoms (IRR (CI): 0.1 (0.0 to 0.9); I2=96%; p<0.01; GRADEPro evidence for observational study: low level; figure 4 and online supplemental table 4). More importantly, we found reduced number of heart failure hospitalisations (IRR (CI): 0.1 (0.0 to 0.7); I2=0%; p<0.01; GRADEPro evidence for RCT: high; figure 4 and online supplemental tables 3 and 4). Also, we observed significantly reduced death or heart failure hospitalisations (IRR (CI): 0.4 (0.1 to 0.9); I2=59%; p-0.03; GRADEPro evidence for RCT: high; online supplemental figure 6 and online supplemental tables 3 and 4).\n\nIn the overall cohort analysis, we observed reduced composite MACE, cardiac death, sudden death and heart failure hospitalisation and no difference in MI, stroke and major bleeding (figures 3 and 4 and online supplemental tables 3 and 4).\n\nAs the outcomes on composite MACE, cardiac death, sudden death and major bleeding are available in only one RCT, we could not assess the same for RCT group. Similarly, we could not assess the composite MACE, stroke, MI, heart failure hospitalisation and major bleeding in the observational studies only group (figures 3 and 4 online supplemental table 3). The sensitivity analysis was also done using the fixed effects model for all the above outcomes, which showed similar results as the random effects model (online supplemental figure 1).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main findings of our study are as follows. First, we did not observe a reduction in all-cause mortality favouring eAVR as compared with conservative management in the analysis confined to patients studied in the RCTs alone. Second, we observed a reduction in heart failure hospitalisation and death or heart failure hospitalisation in the eAVR group. Third, we found no difference in the MI and stroke in the patients randomised group only analysis.\n\nThere exists a significant discordance between the results from RCTs and observational studies explicitly implying the heterogeneity of the data in the observational studies and the possible scarcity of information on the same. The basic nature of biases pertaining to observational studies is carried over to their respective meta-analysis data. Two randomised studies have been published recently addressing the same question. In the study published by Kang et al,12 1031 patients were screened of which 273 patients were asymptomatic. They excluded patients with positive exercise tests. They randomised 145 patients to either early surgery or the conservative management. Nearly 60% had bicuspid valve anatomy. Out of 72 patients, half of them had received received a mechanical valve and bioprosthetic valve each, respectively. In the CA, 74% had surgery primarily due to the development of symptoms. Of note, 17% of the patients needed urgent valve surgery. In the eAVR group, the median time from randomisation was 23 days and it was 700 days in the CA. CV death was observed in 1% in the early surgery group and 15% in the conservative group over a median follow-up of 6 years. In the Aortic Valve ReplAcemenT versus Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic SeveRe Aortic Stenosis Trial (AVATAR), Banovic et al13 randomised 157 patients with asymptomatic severe AS (exercise test negative) to eAVR (78 patients) versus conservative treatment (79 patients). More than 84% had degenerative aortic valve disease, with only 14% having bicuspid anatomy. Out of 78 patients in the eAVR group, 72 underwent surgery (92.3%) in which 53% of patients had received a mechanical valve and the rest had received a bioprosthetic valve. Overall, 32% of patients in the CA received surgery. Most patients (60%) had surgery due to AS-related symptom onset. In the early surgery group, the median time from randomisation to SAVR was 55 days, while it was 400 days in the conservative group. The study was stopped as advised by the DSMB due to the attainment of sufficient events despite a smaller sample size due to an extended follow-up period. The primary outcome (the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke or unplanned hospitalisation for heart failure) was lower in the eAVR group as compared with the conservative group (15.2% vs 34.7%, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.90, p=0.020). Similar to our meta-analysis, no difference in all-cause mortality was noted.\n\nPrior meta-analyses assessing the effects of eAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe AS showed contradicting results. While Lim et al showed no difference in all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality17 between the eAVR group and conservative treatment group, most of the other meta-analyses showed reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the eAVR group.9 18–22 Three recently published meta-analyses that included two RCTs also showed results similar to observational studies.23–25 However, we found no difference between eAVR and the conservative groups in our analysis that is restricted to RCTs, while a beneficial effect was noticed if we included only observational studies or all the published studies. The reason may be differences in confounding variables in the observational studies. Another factor to be considered is having different sample sizes (between the studied groups) and different duration between the studies. In the observational studies, different sample sizes between the active and control groups might have led to an ecological effect.14 26 If we carefully look at the observational studies, the treatment group size was much higher on the control group. It is also well known that the usual measures of heterogeneity on the treatment effect scale are not sensitive to this phenomenon.26 When combining the results of RCTs in a meta-analysis, it is necessary to consider the follow-up duration. Results from RCTs with varying follow-ups can be combined if the effect size considers person-years as the denominator, for example, IRR or HR. In one of the meta-analyses described above, the authors have used a relative risk/OR, which is not ideal in this setting. The IRR as an effect size is ideal in this case because it takes into account varying follow-ups from RCTs and observations studies and also, unlike HRs, which were used in the other two recent meta-analyses, can be calculated with summary information reported in the primary studies.14 15 23–25 Therefore, in our meta-analysis, we used IRR as the effect size, which is technically appropriate for the given research question.23–25 Early valve replacement in severe asymptomatic AS is the pragmatic, randomised trial where patients with asymptomatic, severe AS will be randomised to surgical AVR or conservative therapy will address the issue.27 Also, another large RCT, Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis (The EARLY-TAVR), is being performed in the same population, and the result of the same is expected in 2024 which might answer the question.28\n\nLimitations\n\nOur meta-analysis is a study-level meta-analysis. Varying follow-up period in the RCTs is an issue. However, the effect of the variable follow-up periods was mitigated by measuring outcomes in terms of patient-years (IRR) rather than OR. Also, all the studies have used SAVR as the treatment modality in eAVR group. Hence, the result cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing TAVR. Combining RCT and observational studies for meta-analysis might lead to erroneous results. Hence, we have separate analysis of both the study design ."
