        "text": "1. Do some people avoid automated communication technologies? Validating an avoidance of automated communication (AAC) scale\n\nThe information age began in the 1950s with the introduction of computer technology. Rogers (1986) noted that one component of the industrial age that continued to flourish during the information age was automation. Automation is a challenging term to define, but most agree that it is the use of machines “to execute or help execute physical operations, computational commands or tasks” (Nof, 2009, p. 43), such as automated nurse rostering (Mihaylov, Smet, Van Den Noortgate, & Vanden Berghe, 2016), automated writing evaluation (e.g., Roscoe, Wilson, Johnson, & Mayra, 2017), virtual research assistants (e.g., Hasler, Tuchman, & Friedman, 2013), automated bots (e.g., Clément & Guitton, 2015; Edwards, Beattie, Edwards, & Spence, 2016), and automated health systems (e.g., Farzanfar, Frishkopf, Friedman, & Ludena, 2007). Rogers observed that during the information age automation was materialising in new arenas, including communication. For example, automated teller machines (ATMs) blurred the boundaries between interpersonal and mass communication, and led Rogers to speculate that automated communication technologies (ACTs) would rapidly increase in the decades ahead and that understanding the adoption and use of such technologies would become a central part of communication research (Rogers, 1986).\n\nIn line with Roger’s predictions, the number and type of ACTs have dramatically increased since that time. For instance, ATMs tripled in number from the 1980s to the 2000s, and similar growth has been observed for other ACTs (Velásquez, Chen, Yoon, & Ko, 2009) including rapid growth online (Papsdorf, 2015). Recently, researchers have developed and evaluated more nuanced automated communication devices for health contexts, such as the virtual nurse programme that can perform basic health care routines via a flat screen interface (Bickmore, Pfeifer, & Paasche-Orlow, 2009), a health care check-out system that reduces provider data-entry error (Frank, Lawless, & Steinberg, 2005), and computer physician order entry (Kuperman & Gibson, 2003). Importantly, many of these ACTs are designed to play a role in patient education and management. For example, health care providers could use ACTs to inform their eligible patients that it is time to screen for colon cancer or to as part of check-in/check-out (Dey, 2009).\n\nThough increasingly common, automated communication is not without fault. Communication is a complex human behaviour which may hinder the construction of life-like computer algorithms (Moore, 2001). Indeed, ACTs may be less sensitive to conversation shifts or user goals (Whitworth, 2005). Consistent with this idea, past attempts to develop effective automated communication interfaces have been more prone to failure than success. For example, Microsoft’s automated anthropomorphous paper clip assistant – Clippy – frustrated and annoyed users and ultimately was labelled a failure (Dey, 2009; Veletsianos, 2007).\n\nDue to these problems, automated communication may be viewed negatively by segments of the public and perhaps even actively avoided (Reppenger & Phillips, 2009; Whitworth, 2005). Avoidance of automated communication (AAC) is defined here as actively ignoring, skipping, or terminating messages that appear to originate from interactive communication databases. AAC is a cultivated disposition that can stem from personal, vicarious, or perceived experiences. Of concern, it is possible that avoidance could be heightened in high-risk groups – low literacy populations, older individuals – that ACTs are often designed to serve (Jensen, King, Davis, & Guntzviller, 2010). For instance, the virtual nurse check-out system (Bickmore et al., 2010; Bickmore, Schulman, & Sidner, 2013) is designed to facilitate meaningful patient check-out, notably for individuals who may require additional support due to educational and/or communication deficits. If those same populations are prone to AAC, then such interfaces may need to be modified to account for dispositional avoidance as well as educational/communication deficiencies.\n\nGiven that automated communication is at the centre of many innovative communication advances it is imperative that researchers theorise when and how it might influence acceptance and use of technology. Over two studies, a measure of AAC is proposed and evaluated, and relationships between AAC and other known predictors of technology use are examined (Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003). Understanding when and why individuals avoid automated communication will facilitate optimal design and adoption of automated technologies.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe present study developed and validated the AAC scale. Older individuals were more likely to avoid automated communication (study 2) whereas avoidance-oriented individuals with social phobia were found to favour automated communication (study 1). Consistent with the logic of the construct, less avoidant individuals were more interested in and comfortable with automated communication, including EHRs and virtual nurses.\n\nFuture research with the AAC scale should examine whether certain features of automated interfaces trigger avoidance. There are several promising features to explore as AAC research advances. It has been argued that Microsoft’s Clippy failed primarily because it frequently interrupted users with non-relevant queries and information, a behaviour that was perceived as impolite (Whitworth, 2005). Decreasing avoidant behaviour may require the reconfiguration of ACTs within a more human-centred framework that considers the ramifications and interactions between users, organisations, and communication interfaces (Maglio, Kwan, & Spohrer). Relatedly, Dey (2009) noted that many adaptive applications are rejected by users because they lack sufficient intelligibility – that is, users are unable to understand how and why the technology responds in a given situation. Intelligibility, a form of interface transparency, encourages user trust in the application and allows users to better navigate and self-correct. ACTs that act without cause or encumber users during interaction will likely dissuade avoidant populations and perhaps, as with politeness, cultivate greater avoidance among dissatisfied users. Older individuals, on the other hand, may favour larger interfaces that don’t rely heavily on numerical information (Jensen et al., 2010). Given the relationship between AAC and age, identifying features that reduce avoidance and encourage diffusion within older populations should be an objective of health information systems research. This is especially important given that the majority of consumers of EHRs and other health systems ACTs are older adults (National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Even outside of the health context, ACTs are becoming more and more ubiquitous and the population of the US – as well as several other nations – is ageing rapidly. In order to ensure that this population is well-served, the interconnections between AAC and age should continue to be examined.\n\nThe current study suggests that ACTs could be particularly valuable for individuals with social phobia. In study 1, individuals with social phobia exhibited lower AAC, a finding that is consistent with the explication of both constructs. Past research parallels this finding as teens with social phobia have self-reported greater use of technologies – online chatting and cell phone texting – that allow for less face-to-face interaction (Pierce, 2009).\n\nIn line with this idea, people with high social phobia may prefer interfaces that allow them to disclose personal information without human-to-human interaction. In one study (Kang & Gratch, 2010), participants disclosed a greater amount of more intimate information to a virtual avatar than a webcam video of a real human. If this holds true for ACT contexts, then relational agents, like the virtual nurse, could be effective at reaching socially phobic populations, although researchers should test the assumption that more lifelike computer interfaces are preferred by this subgroup.\n\nIt is possible that as relational agents become more lifelike they will cultivate avoidance in individuals with social phobia, especially as interactive programmes gain the ability to read and react to non-verbal information (Bickmore et al., 2010; Gamble & Rapee, 2010). Individuals with social phobia are sensitive to monitoring and often (incorrectly) perceive that their non-verbal behaviour is incorrect or inadequate (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). This is well illustrated by a study Kang, Gratch, Wang, and Watt (2008) conducted that found that when socially anxious participants were faced with an avatar whose non-verbal responses did not match the speaker’s words they were both more embarrassed and rated their self-performance more poorly than when they interacted with avatars whose non-verbal signals were in sync with the speaker’s words. This suggests that the quality of non-verbal feedback that automated agents provide will likely have a significant impact on the efficacy of relational agents for reaching socially phobic populations. Relational agents aside, researchers should consider the possibility that individuals with social phobia will be less avoidant, and more effective, when using ACTs that exhibit clear structure. Individuals with social phobia have performed better in social situations with clearly defined structure (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997).\n\nUltimately, a key aspect of the work going forward is identifying how individuals high and low in AAC react to different ACT features. It is possible, for example, that features of ACT that appeal to people in general will have no impact on individuals with high AAC, or even a negative impact. For example, research on interactive interfaces has suggested that for the vast majority of individuals, a system that is able to recall previous inputs and use them in guiding future interactions (sometimes referred to as “contingency”) is a highly attractive feature (Sundar, Jia, Waddell, & Huang, 2015). However, for individuals with high AAC, this responsiveness and storing of information may be off-putting, given that it would increase variability in the system response and reduce the reliability of the interaction, features that those high in AAC find to be irritating.\n\nConversely, features that are meaningless to most might be highly attractive to those with high levels of AAC. For example, one of the primary factors in AAC is that people high in AAC find ACTs to be frustrating or annoying. A possible way around this issue would be to increase the politeness of the language used in ACT systems (e.g., “Would you please enter your date of birth?” as opposed to “Enter your date of birth.”). Research has shown that when automated systems display politeness, there is a reciprocity effect, with the users showing greater tolerance and increased positive evaluations of the system (Hoffmann, Kramer, Lam-chi, & Kopp, 2009; Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1997; Reeves & Nass, 1996). Although most users may not care whether or not the system is “polite” (instead appreciating its utility), those high in AAC may be strongly effected by a small change in wording.\n\nCurrently, advances in ACTs are being driven by the structural needs of organisations, technological innovation, and the perceptions of designers and professionals, with a general emphasis placed on product usability. However, it cannot be assumed that simply improving the quality of AACs will benefit the entire population. This study found that social phobics actually have an attraction towards ACTs, and it is possible that other populations that often face difficulty with face to face interactions (e.g., autistic people) may also prefer to engage with ACTs at their current level of technical refinement. Future research should push to examine the exact impact of varying features in ACTs, including the presence and absence of embodied agents and the realism of their responses and actions.\n\nAdditionally, researchers should continue to examine the psychometric properties of the AAC scale. Establishing predictive validity with use of ACTs is a priority as is research examining the stability of the scale overtime (i.e., test-retest reliability). A longitudinal study tracking use of ACTs and AAC at multiple points in time could serve both ends. Researchers looking to use the AAC as a diagnostic tool in technology development might benefit from a state-based version of the measure as that would enable immediate feedback on how specific features trigger avoidance. A state-based measure would also enable researchers to examine the relationship between state and dispositional AAC; a research programme that could identify when and how AAC develops over time. Such a research programme would intersect with research on the development of social phobia (Gazelle & Rubin, 2010). Finally, work investigating the relationship among communication avoidance, apprehension, and AAC would help to explicate the construct and its foundations.\n\n4.1. Limitations\n\nStudy 1 utilised a college student sample which may limit the generalisability of the results. Study 2 was carried out with adults, but participants were recruited from seven malls in Indiana and thus it is best described as a convenience sample. Though more representative than study 1, the demographics of participants in study 2 do not perfectly conform to that of the US. Both studies were survey-based and some questions focused on intentions concerning emerging ACTs. As a result, it is not possible to extrapolate causality or prediction of actual behaviour from these data."
