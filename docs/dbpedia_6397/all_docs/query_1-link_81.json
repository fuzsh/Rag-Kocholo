        "text": "SANNAIYAT 26th July 1916\n\nA fairly lively reciprocal bombardment took place this morning lasting about ¾ hour. Our HE (High explosive)? again did some damage to enemy’s front line parapet. Enemy’s fire though hitting our front line parapet in places and being distributed also over 2nd and 3rd lines was ineffective.\n\nOne day is very similar to another in the trenches and nothing abnormal occurred to 31st July. Our casualties were slight e.g. 1 killed, 8 wounded.\n\n29th July to 31st July 1916\n\nAt 5.30pm a placard in Turkish, was erected by order, on our front parapet announcing to the enemy the fall of Erzinjan.\n\nThe arrival of our new aeroplanes has been followed by increased aerial activity on our part.\n\n1st-3rd [August 1916,] SANNIYAT\n\nEnemy's sniping active - flag of truce went out on 2nd - german officer came out as Turkish representative - at night enemy's fired many 'very lights [?]'\n\nWar Diary, WO 95/5140 51 Battalion Sikhs 1916 Jan.-1917 Dec\n\nMy grandmother’s name was Basant Kaur but she was popularly known by the name of ‘Milkhan’.\n\nEvery month she would go to Jalandhar to withdraw her pension. We kids eagerly awaited her return, because she would always bring some sweets.\n\nShe usually felt sad on that day. She often used to say about that ‘Baba [grandfather] went to Basra but didn’t come back’.\n\nA long time ago, I was reminded of this after reading one particular line in the Guru Granth Sahib. It said (page 418): 'Their husbands did not return home – how did they pass their night?' I remembered my grandmother and felt so sad that I could not sleep that night.\n\nWe use to call her 'Ma Ji'. She was a very brave, hard working and skilful lady. She would work all the time, doing household tasks, and feeding and milking the animals. Her hobbies were working the spinning wheel (charkha) and needlework. She was very skilful in weaving the mats (darris) and beds (charpaees).\n\nShe regularly prayed using prayer beads (mala), in the early morning and at night time.\n\nIn the mid-1970’s, I went to visit India and searched grandmother’s old wardrobe (sanduk), which was still in our house. I found one small quilt (gudalee) containing medals, buttons and a silver rupee. I told my mother that I want to have these. She willingly handed them to me and said to use the silver rupee coin as a gift at the engagement ceremony of my daughter, which I did in 1992. I handed the pair of medals over to my son [Jagdip] to find more information.\n\nSadhu Singh, grandson of Thakar Singh"
