Biography

Lieutenant Colonel John Thornton served with Grayson's Additional Continental Regiment (1777), Continental Army during the American Revolution.

John Thornton is a DAR Patriot Ancestor, A114864.

Colonel John Thornton married Jane Washington, daughter of Augustine Washington.[1] His military contributions during the Revolutionary War, and thereafter, were detailed in his 1796 petition to the House of Delegates in effort to gain lands due him as a Lieutenant Colonel by the Resolutions of Congress of October 1780 and of March 22nd 1783.

Culpeper County Legislative Petitions~John Thornton's Petition November 11th 1796

To the honorable the Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of delegates The petition of John Thornton respectfully sheweth, that your petitioner in the year 1775 received an appointment of Captain in the 3rd Virginia Regiment – and immediately preceded to raise his Company and having completed it on the 17th [could be 12th] of February 1776 received a Commission from the Congress of the United States; that in this capacity he faithfully served his Country during the arduous winter Campaign of 76-77 and at the close of it in March 1777 he was appointed Major to Colonel Thruston's Regiment and was soon afterwards promoted to the Rank of Lt. Col. of the same, in that Station he was active in endeavoring to raise the said Regiments and continued his exertions in that line until the summer of 78 after which he was not called into service as the Regiment was never entirely completed and there was no Command for him; your Petitioner was nevertheless at all times ready to perform services when his country demanded them and as a manifestation of this disposition in the year 1781 when the State was invaded he very cheerfully took the command of a body of Militia, although he was by not compelled to do so. For these services your petitioner has received no Lands although other Officers whose terms of service have been much shorter and less arduous have found no difficulty in obtaining them. Very retired in his mode of life your petitioner has until very lately neglected to inquire into the means by which he may obtain his right, and being informed that the interposition of your Hon. body is necessary to do him justice, he request that his case may be taken into Consideration as your justice has been extended to General Stevens, Col. Parker, General Spotswood & other officers your Petitioner hopes & expects the same at your hands. Circumstanced as he is he prays your Hon. house to grant him a Lieut. Col.'s proportion of land was such other quantity as you may think his services & merits entitle him to – and he will pray as he is in duty bound.[2]
