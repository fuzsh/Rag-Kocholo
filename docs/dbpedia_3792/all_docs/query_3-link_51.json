        "text": "Northumberland County\n\nThe militia was one of the pillars of colonial society. Along with court and vestry, the muster reflected the expectation of colonial and metropolitan authorities that local communities were to be self-reliant. Indeed, they had to be, for they were located on the periphery of the British cultural world. The government in London -- or in colonial capitals like Williamsburg -- did not have the resources to provide for defense. They could do little more than create social institutions that, at the local level, would constitute \"a machine that would go of itself.\" Yet of the three institutions, the militia was the one whose mission was the least defined. The court was the guardian of civil and criminal law. The church sought to save souls and promote morality. But the militia evolved during the first two centuries of Virginia's existence, adapting as the enemy it opposed kept changing. Structure did not always fit function and atrophy sometimes occurred. Yet the idea of self-reliant home defense was strong enough that its legacy continues to this day.\n\nThis article examines the militia in early Virginia in general and Northumberland County in particular -- the historical tradition from which it stemmed, its structure and operation, its purposes, and the social context of which it was a part.\n\nStructure\n\nThe colonial militia was a throwback to an ancient English institution, the medieval Assize of Arms, which dated from 1181. Originally conceived as a means to protect the frontiers with Scotland and Wales, the English militia had become militarily less significant as the danger from the marches declined. As an idea, however, it was preserved for transplantation to the New World when, centuries later, Englishmen again found themselves on the frontier.[1]\n\nThe structural features of the militia were simple. It was composed of every able-bodied freeman living in the county. Each man was required to provide himself with arms, to train periodically under a local officer, and to be ready on to respond to an immediate call for service. Non-compliance was punishable by a fine imposed by a court-martial. The county commander of the English militia was known as the lord lieutenant.[2]\n\nVirginia's militia laws, which were the instructions for Northumberland County's militia officers, all contained these essential elements. The provisions of the 1757 law illustrate the structure and operation in detail.\n\nOfficers The leaders were the county-lieutenant (a civil officer), colonel, lieutenant colonel, major, and captains. They were to be residents of the county and commissioned by the governor on recommendation of the county court. Under the command of each captain and his lieutenant, ensign, and non-commissioned officers was a company of around 60 foot-soldiers.\n\nEligibility Militia service was expected all free male persons above the age of eighteen and under the age of sixty. The only exceptions were indentured servants, overseers responsible for four or more servants or slaves, millers, people employed in mining, ministers, public jailers, students of William and Mary, and leading colonial officials. (Some of those excepted were still required to provide arms for their county.)\n\nEquipment Each soldier was to arm himself with a firelock, a bayonet, a double cartouch box, and three charges of powder, and keep a specified supply of ammunition at his house. Poor individuals were to be provided with arms paid for through the county levy. Free mulattos, Negroes, and Indians were not to be armed, but were to serve as drummers, trumpeters, pioneers, or in other \"servile\" roles.\n\nTraining At least every three months, each captain was to \"muster, train, and exercise\" his company. A general muster and exercise of all companies was to occur in the spring or fall.\n\nDiscipline A court-martial would enforce the various requirements of the militia law. For example, if a soldier disobeyed orders or behaved \"refractorily or mutinously,\" he was subject to being tied \"neck and heels\" for up to five minutes or subject to up to twenty lashes.[4]\n\nMilitia Missions\n\nAt any given time, the militia's mission depended on the nature of the threats faced by local communities and by Virginia as a whole. Over the course of the seventeenth an eighteenth centuries, the dangers evolved and so the uses -- or attempted uses -- of the militia.\n\nThe first threat came from the Indians. As historian Richard Kohn has written, \"During the first years, Americans lived in primitive societies ringed by potential enemies. . . . war in America was a matter of survival . . . a protracted series of desperate conflicts between rival societies marked often by the worst atrocities.\" Indeed, at the outset, the English settlements were military and production organizations -- garrisons rather than communities. It was not until the 1630s that county government and civilian society emerged, with the militia as a parallel structure. The office of commander or lieutenant became a county post.[5]\n\nAs the line of settlement advanced, coastal counties like Northumberland no longer faced an immediate, local threat. Their militias were less fighting units than pools of armed men available for service on a regional basis. When problems occurred, the colonial government formed expeditionary forces or \"marches\" with men from various militias. Thus in 1654, the people of Northumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancaster Counties were the victims of \"divers injuries and insolencyes\" at the hands of the Rappahannock Indians. Late in the year, the Assembly ordered formation of a force of 100 men from Lancaster, 40 from Northumberland, and 30 men from Westmoreland to march to the \"Indian towne\" under the command of John Carter to seek satisfaction without provoking hostilities. Carter was then to report back to the Governor.[6]\n\nIn general, the strategy of Governor William Berkeley in the mid-seventeenth centuries was to segregate Indians and settlers and hope for peaceful coexistence. Not unlike the English strategy in Ireland, a line of forts was erected on the fall line, beyond which settlement was not to extend. Rangers were to patrol between the forts. Consequently, it was harder to sustain readiness in militia units in the lower counties. As the Indian threat began to decline in the 1660s, attendance at muster declined, which the authorities tried to reverse with an increase in fines.[7]\n\nThe Indian threat to white settlements increased again in the mid-1670s. In September 1675, a Northern Neck militia force led by John Washington and Northumberlander Isaac Allerton crossed the Potomac to confront and ultimately kill chiefs of the Susquehannock tribe. Then in March 1676, the colonial government declared \"warr . . . against all such Indians\" who committed \"murthers, rapins and deptredations.\" Militiamen from Northumberland, Lancaster, and Middlesex Counties were sent to garrison a fort in Stafford County. These were episodes that helped spark Bacon's rebellion, the central issue of which how to deal with the Indian threat. Bacon built his political power in part by appealing to volunteers who were impatient with the regular militia.[8]\n\nVery soon, however, the frontier moved further into the interior and the Indian threat faded from the Tidewater. The militia's capacity as a military force faded as well. Sometime around 1688, when Gov. Nicholson toured Virginia, he \"found the militia poorly organized, badly disciplined, and ill-armed because of poverty.\"[9]\n\nLocal Order In a certain sense, however, a new frontier had formed within local society and the militia assumed a new mission. Communities had to be defended from the \"dangerous classes\" and their alienation from the establishment. The two potential sources of instability were poor whites and slaves, both of whom who sometimes saw violence as the only available way of restraining an oligarchic elite.\n\nThe militia was both deterrent and defense against slave insurrections. A rebellion brewed in the Northern Neck as early as 1687, and the first law concerning slave insurrections was enacted in 1702. By 1723, the fear of rebellions was such that a duty was assessed on imported slaves to pay for arms for the militia. Then in 1727, a law was passed that mandated the patrolling of slave quarters for the purpose of \"dispersing all unusual concourse of negroes, or other slaves, and for preventing any dangerous combinations which may be made amongst them at such meetings.\" Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide were thought to be especially dangerous periods. In 1736 and 1738, militia members were ordered to go armed to church.[10]\n\nUsing the militia to control violence by poor whites was another matter, since they were the militia. That reality was no clearer then in the spring of 1732 when riots broke out in Northern Neck over the new system of tobacco inspection. The warehouses at Coan in Northumberland and Deep Creek in Lancaster were burned to the ground by \"malicious and evil dispos'd persons.\" Gov. Gooch called out Northern Neck militia units and those from counties south of the Rappahannock. In the end, Gooch apparently pardoned most of the offenders, who were farmers with fewer than 100 acres and estates of less than £100.[11]\n\nPawns in the Imperial Game As the eighteenth century progressed, America became an arena for the political and military struggle among the European powers. Whether they liked or not, militia forces were seen by the British government as resources in those conflicts.\n\nThus in the run-up to Queen Anne's War, London ordered governor Nicholson to beef up the militia forces to defend against French and Indian attacks. When war actually broke out, imperial authorities ordered Virginia to help in New York's defense with £900 and 240 militia men. But the House of Burgesses, fearful that Governor Nicholson was trying to create a elite military force composed of troublesome servants and loyal only to him, resisted. In its August 1701 session it refused to meet the quota or even amend the militia law to provide better training for local defense. In 1740, Virginians were recruited to go to Cartagena to fight the Spanish in the War of Jenkin's Ear; most did not return.[12]\n\nYet in a generally peaceful environment of eighteenth century Virginia, leaders of the militia were not able to keep its men at such a level of training and discipline that they were ready to serve as warriors on short notice on alien battlefields led by commanders that they did not know. British governors attempted periodically to reform the institution, but with little success. In the 1710s, Gov. Spotswood's pleas to increase the requirements for militia duty and upgrade coastal defenses went unheeded for reasons of costs. Governor Gooch reached the conclusion that \"to no purpose are Men obliged to provide themselves with Arms and Ammunition and to attend the Musters at stated times . . . if when they are got together scarce one Officer knows how to form . . . or instruct them.\" A British traveler to the colonies in the mid-1740s remarked: \"To behold the Musters of their Militia, would induce a Man to nauseate a Sash and hold a Sword forever in Derision. [One sees] diversity of Weapons and Dresses, Unsizeableness of the Men, and Want of the least Grain of Disciplin in their Officers or them.\" Indeed, legislation to strengthen the militia tended to be enacted only in the face of some domestic or foreign threat.[13]\n\nThese patterns were played out again at the outset of the French and Indian War. To compensate for the militia's perceived deficiencies, there was new legislation on the militia as an institution and how it would be used in defending against \"invasions and insurrections.\"[14]\n\nMore importantly, the militia was again used as a pool for creating forces to be deployed on the frontier. Legislation passed in the spring of 1756 required the county lieutenant to assemble all single, able-bodied men at the county court house. He and his fellow officers were to try to get up to five percent of the militia to volunteer for for service. If there were insufficient volunteers, slips of paper were then prepared for the men remaining, and on every twentieth sheet was written: \"This obliges me immediately to enter his majesty's service.\" The papers were put in a box on a table at the court house and the militiamen filed by and drew one each. Those who drew a slip with the writing had three choices: serve in one of the Virginia regiments, pay £10 to the commanding officer, or hire a substitute. The men enlisted were turned over to the colonial officer present and marched to the rendezvous and on to their units, in which they served till December.[15]\n\nTable I provides a list of those men who served during the French and Indian War who are known to have been natives of Northumberland County or were enlisted there.\n\nTable I: Northumberlanders in the French and Indian War\n\nName Age ï¿½Countryï¿½ Captain Record Date Record Place Daniel Bailey 1780 land bounty Nathaniel Barrett 20 Virginia ____ Mercer August 1756 William Bearcroft 22 Virginia Thomas Waggener August 1757 Fort Holland Amos Bentley 23 Virginia 1780 land bounty Henry Bolton Thomas Brown 23 Maryland Robert McKenzie John Carwigg 43 Ireland Joshua Lewis William Croswell 18 Joshua Lewis George Curtice 34 Robert Stewart August 1757 Richard Denny 26 Virginia William Bronaugh July 1756 Richard Denney 30 Virginia Henry Woodward Sept. 1757 John Downey 40 England William Bronaugh July 1756 John Downey 45 England Henry Woodward Sept. 1757 William Dunnaway 23 Virginia Robert Spotswood October 1757 Richard Dunn 49 England William Peachey July 1756 Hancock Eustace Virginia James Gutridge 29 England William Peachey July 1756 John Kirkland 21 Scotland William Bronaugh July 1756 John Leland 46 Virginia Thomas Waggener August 1757 Fort Holland John Lacey 28 Pennsylvania Henry Woodward Sept. 1757 Jacob Lewis 25 Virginia William Peachey July 1756 Jacob Lewis 25 Virginia Thomas Waggener August 1757 Fort Holland Lynum Lunsford deserter Willeby Mackfield 22 Virginia Robert Nash 25 Virginia Geo.

James Phillipsï¿½s service is also documented in Northumberland County Order Book, 1773-1783, 404. Because most records from the French and Indian war do not give information about soldiersï¿½ county of origin, this list probably represents a fraction of the men from Northumberland County who enlisted, were drafted, or agreed to be substitutes during the conflict. Bockstruck, Ibid. at page 26-27 provides names of much of the leadership of the Northumberland County militia from the time of the French and Indian War through 1774.\n\nIf nothing else, military service on the frontier broadened the world-view of those who served. For the first time, at least some of these Northumberlanders were thrown together with men from all over Virginia and other colonies as well. In Thomas Waggner's company of 90 men, for example, thirty-four Virginia counties were represented. There were only six men from Northumberland County and ten from the five lower Northern Neck counties. In Henry Woodward's company of 77 men, Virginians from thirty-two counties were present; twelve men were from the lower Northern Neck and four from Northumberland.\n\nIf service in the militia had some positive effect on the men who served, they, however, tended to make a negative impression on those who led them. George Washington was a case in point. Militiamen's \"reluctance to serve, their readiness to desert and the cowardice that many of them exhibited in the presence of the enemy created early in Washington's mind a disgust that soon became a prejudice. He had to call on them frequently, but he never did so with any confidence.\"[16]\n\nThe Militia's Social Function and Political Consequence\n\nThe Virginia militia may have been understandably inadequate militarily. Its social impact was more significant, reflecting and strengthening the local order. The muster was one of the arenas in which the principles of hierarchy, patriarchy, and deference were made manifest.[17[\n\nThis social dimension of the militia may be seen in the way its leadership in Northumberland County overlapped with the economic and political hierarchies. Table II presents the land holdings and other positions of the men who were recommended or commissioned as militia officers in 1777 and early 1778. With some exceptions, men who held the rank of captain or higher were likely to have been justices by 1777 and to own land worth more than £100 in 1782. Men with lieutenant and ensign ranks tended to hold concurrent positions as tobacco inspectors, constables, and surveyors and to own land that was less than £100 in 1782.\n\nTable II: Land Holdings and Other Offices of Northumberland County Militia Officers\n\nRank Name Land Value (1782) Justice Other Offices County Lieutenant Thomas Gaskins £525 pre-1777 Vestryman, pre-1777 Colonel Thomas Jones £347 Clerk of the Court Lieutenant Colonel Winder Kenner £500 1777 Major John Hull £215 1777 Captain John Cralle, Jr. £85 1777 Vestryman, 1779 William Davenport £275 pre-1777 Sheriff, 1780 Thomas Downing £210 pre-1777 William Downing £142 1779 William Eskridge £115 1777 Vestryman, 1777 William Graham £250 no Surveyor Joseph Harcum £30 no Tobacco Inspector Charles Lee £450 pre-1777 Richard Neale unknown no William Nutt 224 acres* 1777 John Rogers 175 acres* 1779 John Smith unknown pre-1777 Sheriff, 1777 1st Lieutenants David Ball (yngr) £66 no Abraham Beacham £93 1779 Undersheriff, Vestryman militia captain '78 John Claughton £59 no George Ingram £110 no Undersheriff John Span Webb £284 no 2nd Lieutenants George Bearcroft £120 no Surveyor Thomas Bell £20 no Samuel Blackwell £243 no Brigdar Haynie £63 no William Haynie £48 no Surveyor William Nelms £85 no Surveyor Richard Nutt £83 no Matthiaas Self £20 no Surveyor Moses Taylor £50 no Surveyor Benjamin Waddy £110 no Tobacco Inspector Ensigns William Barrett £57 no Tobacco Inspector John Blincoe £50 no Constable John Christopher Jr £73 no Surveyor John Cottrell £156 no Thomas Harcum £15 no Tobacco Inspector Thomas Keene unknown no John Pickerin £22 no Constable Moses Sutton £54 no Surveyor John Webb £64 no\n\nSources: Northumberland County Order Book, 1773-1783; Northumberland County 1782 Land Tax Lists.\n\n* The value of Nuttï¿½s and Rogersï¿½s land is given as a special assessment that may understate its value. Therefore the number of acres owned is given in their cases.\n\nThe militia also served as a training ground for younger members of the gentry in how to exercise leadership in local society. Thomas Gaskins, Jr., the son of the county lieutenant from 1776 to 1782 provides a good example. He became a militia captain in 1767, and was promoted to major in 1774. In the interim, in 1771, he had become a justice and vestryman. The younger Gaskins also illustrates a tendency to nepotism in militia appointments. Richard Hull, who was county lieutenant in the early 1770s, was Gaskins father-in-law and uncle. John Hull, who had been a captain since 1772 and became major in 1777, and Charles Lee, who had been a captain since 1774, were his brothers-in-law.\n\nThe militia, with all its problems, had a political meaning as well. It was the institutional embodiment of the citizen-soldier and the antithesis of the standing army, which Americans with republican beliefs regarded as an agency of tyranny and corruption. As George Mason wrote at the time of the revolution, \"a well regulated Militia, composed of Gentlemen Freeholders, and other freemen, is the natural strength and only stable security of a free Government.\"[18]\n\nThe War of Independence\n\nBecause of the colonists' antipathy to standing armies and their governments' limited capacity to mobilize resources for the independence struggle, the militia served as the foundation for building military forces. As the war went on, of course, the need for a regular, professionalized army became inescapable. In the beginning, however, there was an attempt to continue and elaborate colonial institutions.\n\nIn the wake of the Boston Tea Party and the Coercive Acts, the colonies responded with an economic boycott, as they had done during the Stamp Act crisis. When Britain in turn adopted a hard line, Americans realized, in late 1774, that they had to mobilize military power of their own. In some Virginia counties, \"independent companies\" were created. These were units that beyond the control of the governor, Lord Dunmore; they served as the muscle for county committees of safety. In Northumberland County, the county committee took a different tack. It merely took over the milita. This occurred on December 15, 1774, and was the functional equivalent of forming an independent company.[19] Four months later, the new Virginia units responded to Lord Dunmore's seizure of the gunpowder in the Williamsburg arsenal by beginning a march on the capital. Sixty to seventy Northumberlanders under the command of Peter Presley Thornton marched too, only to be sent home when they got to Fredericksburg.[20]\n\nIn the summer of 1775, as war became inevitable, Virginia's leaders sought to increase and rationalize their military resources. Their approach was to adapt the militia institutions of the past. On August 19th, the Third Virginia Convention passed a \"An ordinance for raising and embodying a sufficient force for the defence and protection of this colony,\" which established a three-tier system of military organization. It divided Virginia into fifteen districts, each of which was to raise one company of sixty-eight men, which would be a part of two regular regiments. In addition, each district was to create a battalion of minutemen who were to receive twenty days of immediate training and twelve days semiannually thereafter. The rest of men in each county were to be members of the militia, which was to muster at least eleven times a year. The hope was for a mix of soldier-citizens and citizen-soldiers that would be able to meet Virginia's defense needs without being too much of a fiscal burden. More regular units were created in November 1775, but the focus was still local defense. Two regiments would be deployed on each of the three necks and two on the Southside.[21]\n\nPursuant to the Conventions mandate, Lancaster District Battalion was created, composed of Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Thomas Jones Sr. was colonel and Peter Presley Thornton was lieutenant colonel. Two minute companies were formed in Northumberland in the summer of 1775. One was commanded by Thomas Gaskins Jr. and the other by Thomas Jones Jr. A training site, Liberty Camp, was established to instill recruits with more military skills than the militia had provided.[22]\n\nThen in early 1776, Northumberland County was ordered to recruit a company for a new regular regiment, the Fifth. Thomas Gaskins Jr. was selected as company commander and signed up sufficient volunteers in a matter of weeks. In line with the principle of local defense, the Committee of Safety deployed the Fifth Virginia Regiment on Northern Neck.[23]\n\nIn time, the voluntarism of 1775 and 1776 would wane, and Virginia's leaders would have to find new ways to secure men to fill the state's quota for the Continental army. Yet even here they relied on the militia's traditional role as a manpower pool for selecting recruits to fight on distant battlefields. Beginning in 1777, Virginia's leaders experimented with procedures to encourage volunteers if possible and require conscripts or substitutes if necessary. All began with splitting up the militia of each county into divisions composed of an equal number of men whose aggregate wealth was about even. In many cases, the threat of conscription was not very serious. Yet all were variations of the scheme, described above, that was used at the beginning of the French and Indian War.[24]\n\nIn some respects, therefore, Virginia's military response to the British challenge was built on traditional institutional models. In one crucial respect, however, the War for Independence represented a sharp break with the past. During that conflict, the primary threat the state faced came not from the western frontier but from the sea. For the first time in a century, coastal counties faced the possibility that the war could be brought to their doorsteps, and by the world's strongest military power at that. It is not surprising, then, that gentry leaders in coastal areas looked to the militia as a means to protect both the county and their own property. Thus the Northumberland elite waged self-interested arguments over who would be militia officers. As John Fallin later recalled, \"there was great excitement growing out of the desire of some leading men to have their friends appointed [to the militia]. The [County] Committee sat until near 12 o'clock at night. There was a personal encounter between Col. [Thomas] Gaskins [Sr.] and Peter Thornton.\" Gaskins Sr. asked Fallin to serve as a militia officer, and got his son, under whom Fallin was then serving, to release him from his position in the minute company.[25]\n\nOf even greater concern to the coastal counties was the realization that the Virginia leadership's initial local-defense strategy would be discarded. In early April, Virginia's Continental regiments, which were initially deployed on the three necks and the Southside, were concentrated at Williamsburg. Then, over the course of 1776, they were sent out of the state all together to help stem the British military tide in the north. Minute units, which were to have been the better trained second line of defense, disappeared in late 1776, probably cannibalized for new Continental units. On the backs of the militia alone was put the responsibility for local defense.[26]\n\nDuring the war the Northumberland militia was called out to defend against enemy attacks or threats thereof every year of the war except 1778. It was also expected to prevent slaves from fleeing to enemy ships. British troops themselves never landed in the county, but pirates in league with the British did come ashore in 1779, 1781, and 1782. On each occasion, militia units drove off them off within a short period of time, but not before tobacco warehouses or plantation seats were burned to the ground and slaves were seized. There are some hints in the records that the privateers had help in their brigandage from disaffected Northumberlanders, and that militia officers lost their commands because they had somehow failed in their duty. Generally, the militia suffered from its usual lack of training and equipment.[27]\n\nThere were efforts on both a state and local level to address the militia's inherent weakness. In view of pirate attacks, the General Assembly in late 1780 ordered the creation of militia cavalry units to provide intelligence and quicker communications. Northumberland was the first Northern Neck county to form a cavalry unit, which was commanded by John McAdam and John Gordon. In 1781, as Northern Neck was in danger of attack by British forces, former Continental general George Weedon sought to make the most of the limited capacity the militia provided. In January, he suggested that, in the event of an attack, militia forces from various counties be brought together to \"defend the county most affected till help can arrive.\" In August, he proposed to take what few arms and ammunition the region possessed and \"arm half the men well and station them to face the enemy.\" The remainder would be left at home \"to protect the Counties from insurrections of Blacks & and from piratical depredations.\"[28]\n\nUnlike the militia in other parts of Virginia, and because of the threat from the bay, Northumberland units were not usually called upon to go to other parts of the state or to the Carolinas to fight the British. The happy exception came in the fall of 1781. McAdam's cavalry company and the regular militia company commanded by Cpt. Samuel Menzies was ordered to Gloucester Camp opposite Yorktown.[29] The war period provided Northumberlanders with a new reminder of another fundamental defect of the militia: it could not be used to preserve social order when its members were themselves the source of disorder. Faced in September 1780 with resistance to conscription for the Continental Army, County Lieutenant Thomas Gaskins Sr. ordered several of his militia captains to mobilize \"a number of men to oppose those who mutinied.\" To Gaskins's great surprise, \"few or none appeared in our favor & the very men I most confided in appeared in arms against us.\" After the courthouse riot on the 15th, the court-martial had to take a soft-line against those who had defied the draft, probably because it lacked the means to enforce a hard line.[30]\n\nAppendix I lists the positions of Northumberland residents who were militia officers during and after the Revolution.\n\nThe New Nation\n\nOnce the war was over and independence a reality, normalcy returned to the militia in counties like Northumberland. External threats were non-existent, marginal changes were made in the militia laws, training was probably modest, and the socially determined rotation of officers continued. One historian writes that for militia leaders in eastern Virginia, the main problems were \"to keep the troops sober on muster day and to avoid making enemies when they appointed officers.\" As a military force, the militia meant little, for the General Assembly refused to appropriate the funds to purchase arms and other equipment. That failure meant nothing in the peaceful east but had serious consequences on the frontier, and federal, state, and local authorities blamed each other for the inadequate defense against Indian raids.[31]\n\nOn a national plane, the militia as an institution became one of a complex of issues that formed the debate over the new political order. On the one hand, there were those who believed that the War of Independence and its aftermath had shown that the United States needed a stronger central and national government and the means to pay for it. For them, a standing army was a necessity if the country was to be defended. The militia's performance during the war was a symptom of its institutional weakness. On the other side were people who did not believe that the new nation should create a powerful -- and potentially tyrannical -- government of the very sort that had provoked the Revolution in the first place. For them, a standing army and national taxation would not only not solve the problems of the present but also create dangers in the future. Keeping the balance of power in favor of the states and relying on institutions like the militia were the ways to preserve freedom. (That the militia in states like Virginia was a source of social prestige at the local level only strengthened its constituency.)\n\nSo it was that the militia and who controlled it became an issue in the constitutional convention of 1787 and the state ratifying conventions that followed. Anti-Federalists worried about a charter that made the President the commander of the state militias \"when called into the actual service of the United States\" and that granted to the national Congress the following powers:\n\nto declare war;\n\nto create a national army and navy;\n\nto authorize the call-up of the militia \"to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions\";\n\nto provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia; and\n\nto govern \"such part of them may be employed in the service of the United States.\n\nIt was partly to allay this perception of excessive potential power that the Bill of Rights of 1789 included the following as the Third Amendment: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"[32]\n\nFor their part, the nationalists sought for ways to strengthen the militia on a systematic basis because they believed that was the only way to provide for national defense, given the hostility to a standing army. With Washington's support, Secrtary of War Henry Knox submitted a plan to Congress in January 1790 that was \"the culmination of Federalist thinking about the militia.\" Knox proposed splitting each state militia into three tiers: an \"advanced corps\" of men aged 18-10; a \"main corps\" of those 21 to 45; and a \"reserved corps\" of men 46 to 60. The men advanced corps would receive 10 to 30 days of intensive training every year in \"camps of discipline\" where no distractions would interfere. Taken together, the advanced corps would be an army of around 30,000 men who could be mobilized quickly in a crisis. The soldiers of the main corps would train for four days every year and be a pool from which men could be drawn for a prolonged conflict. The reserve corps would be the home guard, like the current militia. The plan, however, ran into intense ideological and political opposition. The Uniform Militia Act that was passed by Congress in the spring of 1792 made only modest changes in the state-oriented status quo.[33]\n\nThe modifications made in Virginia as a result of the 1792 law were primarily organizational. Numbered militia regiments were formed on a county or bi-county basis. Several regiments formed a brigade, and several brigades formed a division. Initially, Northumberland and Lancaster Counties were to be one regiment but Northumberland was soon designated the 37th Regiment. In March 1794, the county court recommended that Leroy Edwards be Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the regiment, and that John Gordon and Catesby Jones be majors in command of two batallions. As captains, the court nominated George Ingram, George Ball, Robert Edwards, Samuel Cralle, Thomas. D. Downing, Moses Taylor, Williamm Nelms, William Oldham, William Claughton, and John Hobson Fallin. A year and a half later, the court met the requirement that it form one company each of light infantry and grenadiers. Charles Lamkin was recommended as captain of the former and John T. Thornton to head the latter. Yet these changes were superficial. Without the necessary training and funding, neither the national defense nor the militia was better off.[34]\n\nThe War of 1812\n\nThe failure of the early Republic to address the issue of military power was apparent in the next war with Britain, the last in which the militia was a significant element of American defense strategy. Northumberland County happened to provide a momentary stage on which the consequences of neglect were acted out. At the time, its 37th regiment was composed of at least twelve companies.\n\nDuring the summer of 1814, the British embarked on a general campaign of destruction in the Chesapeake Bay. In the weeks before their march on Washington, enemy vessels were at work near Northern Neck. A landing occurred around July 28th at Nomini Bay in Westmoreland County. British troops destroyed houses and crops and made off with around a hundred black slaves. At about the same time, a large ship was seen near the mouth of the Coan River in Northumberland. Militia units of several counties were called out.[36]\n\nThen a little before sunrise on August 3rd, about 300 enemy soldiers landed at Monday's Point on the banks of the Yeocomico River. A militia unit under Captain William Henderson met the enemy by firing most of their ammunition. His unit then retreated about seven miles inland to his plantation. The British followed him to that point, where they burned his storehouse, his out-house, and houses across the border in Richmond County. The enemy then returned to the shore, burning all the houses on the road -- \"ravages that his love of devastation and the ample means he possesses inclined him to gratify.\" On the 7th, three enemy ships went up the Coan River to within two miles of the Northumberland Courthouse, intent on seizing three anchored schooners. A company of Lancaster militia initially held off the attackers but had to withdraw when ten more barges sailed into view. \"The British then took possession of the three schooners -- landed on both sides of Cone and burned all the houses they could find, some of which the property of James Smith, postmaster at Northumberland court-house, cost upwards of six thousand dollars.\" Militia units were handicapped by the fact that, as John Hungerford, a Westmoreland militia officer reported, \"Our negroes are flocking to the enemy from all quarters, which they convert into troops, vindictive and rapacious -- with a most minute knowledge of every bye path.\"[35]\n\nIn early October, six weeks after the burning of Washington and three weeks after the shelling of Fort McHenry, the British returned to Northumberland County. On the 4th, half of a 3,000-man detachment landed at the head of the Coan River and quickly drove off the militia defenses. The other half landed further up the Potomac and sought without success to cut off the retreating Virginians. The British did seize thirty to forty stand of arms, ammunition, slaves, and stock, and burned the furniture of a number of families. The final act occurred on the 7th, when a \"marauding party\" landed in the lower part of the county and burned the houses of one farm.[37]\n\nEpilogue\n\nDuring the 1814 attacks, John Hungerford provided an apt summary of the liability of relying on the militia for defense of America. He did so in a manner that echoed his predecessors during the Revolutionary War. \"Unless the Government will give this quarter more effectual aid, the ruffian system of warfare carried on by the enemy, aided by such means [as support from slaves] will light up one universal conflagration throughout these counties.\" The American militia was perhaps a rational response of weak governments to problems such as Indian attacks on the frontier and slave rebellions in more settled areas. It certainly reinforced the hierarchy of wealth, status, and power in local communities organized by patriarchal principles. It was less successful, however, either as a home guard in defending against more mobile and better equipped forces, or as manpower pool for large-scale military operations on distant battlefields. As the American national government grew in power over the nineteenth century, the militia was an institution that it would transcend and transform. Its mystique would survive, but its utility would fast diminish.[38]\n\nAppendix I: Northumberland County Militia Officers, 1777-1795\n\n[NOTE: Documentation on militia officers is uneven. The county order book provides good coverage of changes in assignment during the Revolutionary period, but not thereafter. Even in the Revolutionary period, there are a number of cases where the court recommended an assignment, there is no record that the individual concerned presented a commission, but there is evidence that the assignment was filled as the court suggested. For purposes of this list, it is assumed that the individuals recommended did serve unless there is evidence to the contrary. NLT = no later than.]\n\n(Dr.) George Ball: Cpt., 1789-? (NLT 1794).
