        "text": "BEIRUT (AP) — Hamas on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader in a dramatic sign of the power of the Palestinian militant group's hardline wing after his predecessor was killed in a presumed Israeli strike in Iran.\n\nThe selection of Sinwar, a secretive figure close to Iran who worked for years to build up Hamas' military strength, was a defiant signal that the group is prepared to keep fighting after 10 months of destruction from Israel's campaign in Gaza and after the assassination of Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIt is also likely to provoke Israel, which has put him at the top of its kill list after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nThe announcement comes at volatile moment. Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas’ military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, “There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we’re preparing and intending for him.”\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza — particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades — has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators — though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n“The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,” he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas “remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.”\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a “consensus choice” popular among all factions and involved in the group’s decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a “fierce fighter on the battlefield.”\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms — a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sinwar “has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the cease-fire.”\n\nHe said Sinwar must “decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire … It really is on him.”\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, “I will walk back home after this meeting.” He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. “Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group’s next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,” he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, “not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,” he said.\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, left, standing with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, right, speaks during a news conference at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024.

(AP) — The booming business of the NFL will now be open for more business.\n\nLeague owners voted their carefully crafted approval of private equity in club ownership, putting in place a provisional new rule on Tuesday that lets certain firms buy up a stake of up to 10% in any of the 32 franchises that have soared in value over the past few decades like few other industries.\n\nAt a special meeting in Minnesota, nine days before the regular-season opener, owners for the first time opened their teams to institutional investment after previously prohibiting it. Other major American sports leagues allow as much as 30% holdings by private equity firms, and it's also a common practice in international soccer.\n\n“It’s an access to capital that has been interest to us for a long time,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said after the session at the Omni Viking Lakes Hotel, which sits across from the headquarters of the Minnesota Vikings. “I think it’s an appropriate thing to give teams that liquidity to reinvest in the game and to their teams.”\n\nThe NFL with this vote permitted only four different groups to enter the arena: standalone firms Arctos Partners, Ares Management Corporation and Sixth Street, plus a consortium of five funds — Blackstone, Carlyle, CVC, Dynasty Equity and Ludis. The approved list could well be extended in the future, but these selections from the initial vetting process were made based on having the cash ready to go right away.\n\nLudis was founded by Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin, who spearheaded the collaboration as part of his effort to include minority race investors in NFL ownership positions.\n\n“This is something that we’ve long fought for and tried to find ways to encourage that,” Goodell said.\n\nIn addition to the 10% private equity cap, there were other guardrails established. Multiple funds can account for the 10%, but there's a 3% minimum investment for each. Each purchase must be held for a minimum of six years. There's a maximum of six teams that each of the approved funds can invest in, and no more than 20% of each fund can go to one NFL club. No individual investor can own more than 7.5% of a fund. Also, league owners and their families are allowed to invest their own wealth in these funds, but only up to 3% of them.\n\nThe NFL let MLB, MLS and the NBA and NHL go ahead on this front, content to take notes in a cautious approach with a steadfast goal of preserving the parameters of the single-owner structure that has seen several of its prominent franchises stay in the same family for generations. Controlling owners must own at least 30% of the team, and no more than 25 owners can be part of an ownership group.\n\n“We tried to talk to people who we think were in the know,” Goodell said. “We were patient on this.”\n\nSince the study was initiated five years ago, the Denver Broncos ($4.65 billion) and Washington Commanders ($6.05 billion) have been sold in further illustration of the opportunity for current owners to liquify portions of their teams. These increasingly expensive and complicated transactions have also become more difficult for prospective owners without potential cash boosts from private equity firms.\n\nThe process accelerated a year ago, and a special committee on ownership policy was created including Kansas City's Clark Hunt, Denver's Greg Penner, New England's Robert Kraft, Cleveland's Jimmy Haslam and Atlanta's Arthur Blank.\n\n“The support today in the room was very strong for this decision,” Penner said. “One thing that was really important was giving owners a different option for capital sources but at the same time maintaining how we operate.”\n\nThere's no reason for fans to be concerned that this new source of potential investors will affect any football operations, the league said.\n\n“All it is is a silent position that would allow access to capital for those teams that wish to offer 10% of their team,” Goodell said. “They will not be in any kind of decision-making influence in any way.”\n\nThe stipulations also entitle the league to a portion of the proceeds from each sale, Goodell confirmed.\n\n“The private equity firms that participated in this absolutely understood and expected that the NFL would have a collective participation in this,” he said.\n\nNaturally, a league with a stated goal of soon reaching $25 billion in annual revenue is not going to make an unsound financial decision.\n\n“I know this: This is good for anybody that's in love with the NFL, any part of it,” Dallas owner Jerry Jones said.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nFILE - NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announces a pick during the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, April 28, 2022, in Las Vegas.
