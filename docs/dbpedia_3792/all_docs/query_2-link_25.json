These were the sons of Roger, Henry, Thomas and others and came from places like Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Middlesex.  They may or may not have known each other, but they were all descended from the same line.  Their descendants in the US are numerous and widespread. \n \nWe currently have a DNA project based on Y-chromosome",
