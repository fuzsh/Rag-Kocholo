        "text": "George originally intended to be a planter. He was appointed to his first public office as surveyor of Culpeper County. In December 1753 Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia asked Washington to carry a British ultimatum to the French Canadians on the Ohio Frontier. The message was ignored. He was made a Lieutenant Colonel by Governor Dinwiddie in 1754 and sent him to lead an expedition to Fort Dusquesne. Washington and his American Indian, Tanacharison led allies, as well as his troops, ambushed a French Canadian Scouting Party led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. Washington's only military surrender occured at Fort Necessity. Unable to read French, Washington was tricked into signing a surrender statement that stated he assassinated Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. . 1755 found Washington as an aide to Bridish General Edward Braddock. In the Monongahela Expedition, Braddock was killed and Washington was made the Hero of the Monongahela. In 1758 Brigadier General Washington was in the Forbes Expedition that caused the French to evacuate Fort Duquesne and Pittsburg. He would resign from the military serrvice later in 1758 and return to being a Virginia planter and politician.\n\nIn April 1775, after fighting broke out and in military uniform, Washington appeared at the Second Continental Congress letting them know he was prepared for war. He had the military experience, charisma, military bearing and reputation as being a strong patriot and he was supported by the south. John Adams nominated George Washington, and he was appointed Major General. He was also elected by Congress to be Commander-In-Chief. In July 1775, Washington assumed command of the Continental Army in Cambridge Massachuesetts, during the siege of Boston. British General William Howe launched a naval and land campaign in August 1776, to seize New York and offer a settlement. In the Battle of Long Island, Washington and the Continental Army engaged in battle with the enemy in the largest battle of the entire war. His army's nightime retreat across the East River, occured without a loss of a single life, is considered one of Washington's greatest military feats. The Night of December 25, 1776 saw a counter attack by Washington, leading the American forces across the Delaware River. After his victory in Trenton, was a victory in Princeton. His troops were defeated in the Battle of Brandywine in 1777 by British fources. How was able to march into Philadelphia. Washington's army camped at Valley Forge in December o 1777 for six months. Washington attacked the British in Monmouth and drove them out of Philadelphia, into New York.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed in September of 1783, caused Great Britain to recognize the United States independence. November 02 1783 is when Washington gave a farewell address to his soldiers after disbanding his army. He resigned his commission as Commander-In-Chief with a formale farewell to his officers on December 23 1783. His retirement was shortlived with an exploratory trip in 1784 to the western frontier. He was persuaded to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, in 1787. He was elected unanimously as President of the Convention.\n\nIn 1789, the Electoral College elected Washington unanimously, and in 1792 he was elected again. Wiith a salary of $25,000 a year, he was made the First President under the Constitution, for the United States of American on April 30 1789, in New York's Federal Hall. Washington retired in March of 1797, from his position as President and returned to his home in Mout Vernon. July 04, 1798 President John Adams, Washington became Lieutenant General and Commander-In-Chief of the armies to serve in a prospective war with France. From July 13, 1798 thru December 14, 1799, he served as the senior officer of the United States Army. In Snow, Hail and freezing rain, Washington inspected his farms on horseback. The next morning he took sick with laryngitis and pneumonia. He died on the evening of December 14, 1799 in his home at age 67. (unknown source)\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nGeorge Washington, the 1st President of the United States, was born in Virginia, in the year 1732.\n\nThe common schools of that State afforded the only opportunity for his education. The study of mathematics was his principal delight. At the ago of nineteen he received an appointment in the army with the title of Major, was advanced to Colonel in 1754, and took charge of a campaign against the French at Fort Du Quesne, now Pittsburg, Pa. Erected Fort Necessity near that place, where he was attacked by four times his number of French and Indians, and, after ten hours severe fighting, was forced to surrender, but with the honorable terms of being allowed to return to Virginia unmolested with his command. We next find him covering the retreat of Braddock, where, by his cool bravery, he saved the army from destruction.\n\nHe was elected a member of the House of Burgesses, of Virginia, in 1759, and a delegate to the first Continental Congress in 1774. In that day of great peril, when Congress had done what it could to raise \" That glorious old Continental Army\" all eyes were turned to Washington as its leader, and he was unanimously appointed its Commander-in-Chief; which he (with modesty and dignity) accepted, but declined all compensation for his services, asking only for the remuneration of his expenses.\n\nMary (Ball) Washington\n\nWASHINGTON, Mary (Ball), mother of George Washington, was born in Lancaster county, Va., in 1706, youngest daughter of Joseph Ball. Her grandfather, Col. William Ball, of Kent, England, served iii the Royalist army, and in 1650 settled in Virginia. His brother, Rev. John Ball, was a Puritan minister of Woodstock, Oxfordshire; and his family, of ancient and honorable lineage, is said to be descended from John Ball, the \"mad preacher of Kent,\" who was beheaded in 1381 for participation in the rebellion of Wat Tyler. William Ball died in Virginia, in 1669. leaving two sons, William and Joseph, and one daughter, Hannah (Ball) Fox. The male line is continued solely by the descendants of his son, William, who left eight sons and one daughter. After the death of his father, Joseph Ball went to England to look after the estate, and was there married some years before his return in 1695. During the remainder of his life he was a prosperous planter, a vestryman of Christ Church, Lancaster, Va., and noted in the community for generosity and high social graces. Of the early life of his daughter, Mary, little is known. Her educational advantages were limited, the schools of the period being few and mostly taught by the parish ministers. She was reported beautiful, in youth a great belle, and was recognized among her associates as a person of rare charm and dignity of character. Her father died when she was a very little child, and she lost her mother in 1729, whereupon she went to live with her brother, Joseph Ball, a practicing lawyer in London, England. Here she met Augustine, son of John Washington, of Westmoreland county, Va., who after the death of his wife, Jane Butler, in 1728, is said to have resided for a while in Cookham, Berkshire, where he had fallen heir to some property. Here, it is supposed, they were married, March 6, 1730, and here, on the authority of a Mrs. Morer, whose mother claimed to have nursed him in infancy, it has been asserted that their illustrious son was born two years later. The belief is still current, however, that George Washington was born in the modest farmhouse of his parents in Westmoreland county, Va. Augustine Washington was a typical gentleman of the best breeding of that day, was wealthy as wealth was then estimated, and the owner of several sizable farms in northeastern Virginia. The house to which he took his young wife was situated on the Potomac river between Pope's and Bridge's Creeks, a plain and substantial structure. On its site still remains a tablet placed there by G. W. P. Custis, declaring it the birthplace of the Father of his Country; and it is certain that here the second and third children of Mary Washington were born in June, 1733, and November, 1734. The house was destroyed by fire in April, 1735, and the family shortly after took up their residence at another farm owned by Mr. Washington on the left bank of the Rappahannock river, near Fredericksburg, Va. There Mary Washington gave birth to three other children: John Augustine, in January, 1736; Charles, in May, 1738; and Mildred, in June, 1739. The sudden death of Mr. Washington, April 12. 1743, was a sore affliction to the little family, but Mrs. Washington displayed the sterling worth and heroism of her character. As sole guardian of her children, she had the entire management of their training and education. She conducted daily prayers for her household and read selections for their edification from the Scriptures and books of devotion. As a disciplinarian she was firm and unyielding, demanding implicit obedience from children and servants alike. She was accustomed to visit her farm almost daily, seated in her open chaise, and would personally direct and superintend the work. Her energy would not suffer her to remit her labors even on the approach of old age. It is related that when her son in-law, Col. Lewis, once proposed that he should relieve her in the management of her affairs, the aged lady gave answer: \"Do you keep my books in order, for your eyesight is better than mine; but leave the management of the farm to me.\"\n\nAfter the surrender of Cornwallis, a grand ball was given at Fredericksburg to the leaders of the victorious army, and Washington attended with his mother. It is said that the foreign officers were anxious to meet the mother of their commander, and were \"amazed on beholding one whom so many causes conspired to elevate, preserving the even tenor of her life, while such a blaze of glory shown upon her name and offspring.\" Washington regarded his mother with a filial affection and obedience unusual even in that day of respect and reverence for parents. At the age of fifteen he had an opportunity to enlist in the royal navyâhis baggage was already on board the man-of-war in the Potomacâbut his mother's final decision against the project was imperative despite his disappointment. Even in 1754, when desiring to enlist against the French and Indians he delayed his decision until her full consent was obtained. Such a mother and such a son were rare then, as now, but their examples are worthy all emulation.\n\nOn April 14,1789, he parted with her for the last time, going from her door to be inaugurated first president of the United States. Shortly after the august ceremony in New York he was seized with an acute malady, and had barely recovered his strength when he received the tidings of his mother's death, on Aug. 25, 1789. Mrs. Washington's piety was childlike and sincere. She would retire daily to a tree-shaded spot on her great farm, to pray and meditate on the sacred themes of some favorite book of devotion, and in accordance with a provision of her will, she was there buried. In 1833 was laid the foundation of a splendid monument to her memory, Pres. Andrew Jackson being present, and making an address, but there the matter rested, and the memorial still remains uncompleted.

June 5, 1762. The son of John Augustine, younger brother of George Washington; was graduated from William and Mary College in 1778, and read law in Philadelphia in James Wilson's office. In 1780-81 he served in Col. J. F. Mercer's troop, which was disbanded after the siege of Yorktown. He practiced at home, at Alexandria and at Richmond; was a member of the house of delegates in 1787, and of the convention which ratified the federal constitution; and from Dec. 20, 1798, was a judge of the U. S. supreme court, receiving his appointment from President Adams. He was of \"small and emaciated frame, and countenance like marble,\" but eminent for learning and ability. He published Reports of the Virginia Court of Appeals, 1790-96. in two volumes (1798-99), and of the U. S. Court for the Third Circuit, 1803-27, in four volumes (1826-29). partly edited by R. Peters; these, in the opinion of his biographer, did him but imperfect justice. At the organization of the Colonization Society in June. 1817, he became its president. As the general's favorite nephew, he inherited Mount Vernon, which afterward passed to R. E. Lee through the Curtis family. He died Nov. 26. 1829. His Life, by H. Birney, was privately printed in 1858. [Source: The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Volume 2; Publ. 1906, by James T.

John Washington.\n\n\"William Means, aet. 32, deposes and says that John Washington arrived in Virginia in 1656 in the capacity of second man or mate to Edward Prescott, a merchant.\"\n\nThe will of Richard Cole was proved June 24, 1674, and the affidavit of Col. John Washington attached says:\n\n\"Deposition of Col. John Washington, aet. 45, or there-about,\" etc., . . . \"and further deponent sayeth not, John Washington.\" So Col. Washington was forty-five in 1676. He died two years later. He was therefore born about 1631 and his brother Laurence about 1635.\n\nCol. John Washington married three times: first, Anne Pope. previous to May 11, 1650, daughter of Colonel Nathaniel Pope; second, Anne Gerrard, widow of Walter Broadhurst, who died between Jan. 26 and Feb. 12, 1659; third, Frances Gerrard, widow of Col. Valentine Peyton; widow, also, of Capt. John Appleton, and of Col. Thomas Speke; d. in 1659.\n\nWhen John Washington first came to Virginia in 1656 he stayed at the house of Col. Nathaniel Pope, and being about twenty-five years of age he naturally fell in love with the daughter of his host, Anne Pope, and they were married 1658 or '59, and Sept. 20, 1659 their son, Laurence Washington, was baptized.\n\nNathaniel Pope was one of the twenty-four freemen of the \"Grand Inquest,\" in Maryland in 1637. He did not know how to write, and affixed a mark for his signature. In 1643 he and his \"nine menial servants\" were exempted from all military service; sent as agent to Kent Island, in 1647, he attempted, as charged, to persuade the people there to come and live at Appomattox until they should become strong enough to seize and hold their Kent Island homes. In 1656 he was made Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nHe married Luce, and had issue:\n\nI. Anne Pope. Married John Washington.\n\nII. Margaret Pope. Married William Hardwick.\n\nIII. Thomas Pope.\n\nIV. Nathaniel Pope.\n\nCol. John Washington married Anne Pope and had three children:\n\nI. Laurence Washington. Married Mildred Warner.\n\nII. John Washington.\n\nIII. Anne Washington. Married Francis Wright.\n\nSeptember 28, 1670, is the date of a statement of account of Lieutenant Colonel John Washington, who married Ann, widow of Henry Brett: \"And we do find that Mrs. Ann Brett Washington has paid,\" etc., etc., \"witness our hand this 3rd October, 1670. Recorded 9th October, 1670.\"\n\nMay 31, 1671, Mr. Samuel Brett of Plymouth executed a discharge to \"Lieutenant Colonel John Washington who intermarried with Mrs. Ann Brett, widow and administratrix of Henry Brett, of Plymouth, merchant, deceased.\"\n\nThe Anne Washington of Col. John Washington's will was not the Anne Washington, mother of his three children, Laurence, John and Anne, but was the dead Anne therein referred to. The live Anne Washington of the will was the Anne (widow of Walter Broadhurst, that in the interval since his death had married Mr. Henry Brett who also had died; whereupon she married Colonel John Washington).\n\nAn old document in the diocesan registry of Litchfield, dated April 12, 1678, stated that Walter Broadhurst, her son, \"was granted administration of the goods of Anne Washington, alias Broadhurst, late of Washington Parish in the County of Westmoreland, Va.\"\n\nIn Westmoreland County is recorded a marriage contract between Col. John Washington and Frances Appleton, widow of Col. John Appleton and born Frances Gerrard. This contract is dated May 10, 1676, so, of course, Mrs. Anne Washington, the second, must have died before that date.\n\nFrances Gerrard, daughter of Dr. Thomas Gerrard and his first wife, Susanna, daughter of Justinian Snow, one of the founders of Maryland and Lord Baltimore's factor in the Indian traders, married, first, Col. Thomas Speke; he died in 1659. She married, second, Colonel Valentine Peyton and had Gerrard Peyton, who died s. p. She married, third, Captain John Appleton, who died between February 25 and April 12, 1676. On May 10, 1676, she entered into a fourth matrimonial engagement, this time with Col. John Washington.\n\nDr. Thomas Gerrard was for a long time Councillor in Maryland, but was finally banished for taking part in the insurrection of Isaias Fendall in 1659. Before this he had provided a refuge in Virginia having obtained, October 18, 1650, a patent for land and naming among the head rights his wife, Susanna Gerrard, and his children, Susanna, Temperance, Frances, Justinian, and John Gerrard. The same day, October 18, 1650, Walter Broadhurst patented land next to William Hardwick on the west side of \"Poor Jack Creek.\" As Walter Broadhurst had a son \"Gerrard,\" it might be that Anne, his wife, who afterwards married Col. John Washington, was a daughter of Col. Thomas Gerrard, as well as Washington's third wife, Frances.\n\nCapt. John Appleton, b. 1640; d. 1676. A letter is extant from him to \"his brother, Mr. Richard Colbourn, near Spittlefield's Gate, London,\" dated June 12, 1674. He married Frances Gerrard, widow of Thomas Speke and of Valentine Peyton. It is not believed that he left children. After his death his widow married, fourth, Col. John Washington.\n\nThomas Speke, b. 1603, d. 1659, patented in 1650, one thousand acres of land.
