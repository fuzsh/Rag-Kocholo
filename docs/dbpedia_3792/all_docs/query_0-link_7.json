        "text": "Main\n\nJohn Thornton Augustine Washington was born 20 May 1783 \"Cedar Lawn\" in Charles Town, West Virginia, United States to Thornton Augustine Washington (c1760-1787) and Mildred Berry (1760-1785) and died 9 October 1841 \"Cedar Lawn\" Charles Town, West Virginia, United States of unspecified causes. He married Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger (1793-1837) 24 September 1810 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, United States.\n\nJohn Thornton Augustine Washington (May 20, 1783 – October 9, 1841) was a prominent Virginia (now West Virginia) landowner, farmer, and statesman and a member of the Washington family. Washington was a great-nephew of George Washington, first President of the United States.[1][2]\n\nEarly life\n\nWashington was born on May 20, 1783 at \"Berry Hill\" plantation near Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia) and was the eldest son of Thornton Augustine Washington, a nephew of George Washington, with his first wife Mildred Berry Washington.[3][4][5] Washington had one younger brother, Thomas Berry Washington (born c. 1792), who died in childhood, and a younger half-brother from his father's second marriage, Samuel Washington.[4]\n\nMilitary and political career\n\nUnlike other prominent members of the Washington family, Washington was not fond of public life. According to his son, Washington had a preference for \"the quiet and congenial occupation of a country gentleman.\"[6] During the War of 1812, Washington was offered the rank of captain and the command of a company of cavalry in the United States Army, but turned down the offer in order to participate in the fighting as a private.[6] Following the war, Washington served one term as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, but declined to run for a second term.[7] Washington was then appointed to the position of High Sheriff of Jefferson County, but he refused the appointment and it was then offered to a deputy.[8]\n\nLand holdings\n\nWashington inherited his parents' \"Berry Hill\" plantation, where in 1825 he built the present Federal-style dwelling on the property he renamed \"Cedar Lawn.\"[1][9] In addition to his \"Cedar Lawn\" estate, Washington also owned lands along Bullskin Run, a small tributary stream of the Shenandoah River, near \"Cedar Lawn\" and also on the Kanawha River in Mason County.[2]\n\nMarriage and children\n\nOn September 2, 1810 at Shepherdstown, Washington married Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger, the daughter of Daniel Bedinger and Sarah Rutherford Bedinger.[10][11] Elizabeth's father was a general in the American Revolutionary War and her maternal grandfather Robert Rutherford was a member of the United States House of Representatives representing the lower Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.[12] Her brother, Henry Bedinger III, was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and later served as Chargé d'Affaires and Minister to Denmark for United States President Franklin Pierce.[13]\n\nWashington and his wife Elizabeth produced a large family including five sons and eight daughters:[5][14][15]\n\nLawrence Berry Washington (November 26, 1811 – September 21, 1856)\n\nDaniel Bedinger Washington (born February 8, 1814)[16]\n\n∞ first cousin Lucy A.
