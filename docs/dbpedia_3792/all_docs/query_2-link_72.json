        "text": "Celebrations are being held to mark the 400th anniversary of the opening of a Jacobean bridge.\n\nThe Grade 1-listed Berwick Old Bridge was closed for several months last year for repairs costing more than £800,000.\n\nThe bridge, built between 1611 and 1624, spans 355m of the River Tweed.\n\nBetween 10:00 and 16:00 BST on Sunday, a 17th Century period encampment will take place on Palace Green during which re-enactors will stage displays including firing cannon and muskets.\n\nLindsay Benton, the town's vice chair of the chamber of trade and committee member of the Berwick Bridge 400 group, said it had taken more than a year to organise the celebrations.\n\nShe said: \"People are passionate about our beautiful bridge.\n\n\"It is the heart of Berwick and has connected the community.\n\n\"I'm delighted by the way everyone has engaged with the project with such dedication.\"\n\nThe structure was built on the command of James VI of Scotland who was dismayed at the state of the old wooden bridge he had to cross on his way to London to be crowned James I of England.\n\nHe paid for it to be built, according to the Berwick Record Office.\n\nArt and craft activities, including workshops with artist in residence Annie Lord, will also take place at nearby Queen’s Garden to mark the anniversary.\n\nThe Northstar Shindiggers, a drumming group for adults with a learning or physical disability, will perform at noon at Riverside Green.\n\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.
