The Presidential Library invites readers to take a virtual film tour of the North-West region of our country. Documentary films prepared by library specialists are available on the library's portal.

One such city is Veliky Novgorod, known as the cradle of Russia.\n\nOn August 18, 1782, a monument to Peter the Great, the first Emperor of Russia, was unveiled on Senate Square. Later, thanks to a famous poem by Alexander Pushkin, the sculpture became known as \"The Bronze Horseman.\" It is said that Catherine II, who followed in the footsteps of Peter the Great, wanted to always have the image of her predecessor before her eyes. Great people love and respect the achievements of others, and consider it a loss for themselves if they do not give credit to virtue and glory, as publicist Sergei Glinka wrote in his publication \"Ruskaya Istoriya\" (1823).\n\nA new virtual tour of the exhibition Memory of Generations: the 80th Anniversary of the Relief of the Nazi Siege of Leningrad has been published on the portal of the Presidential Library. The exhibition was opened in the building of the library on May 27th, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the full liberation of Leningrad from the Nazi siege, the Day of the Foundation of St. Petersburg, All-Russian Library Day, and the 15th anniversary of the Presidential Library.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, the 80th anniversary of the formation of Tyumen region will be celebrated. For many years, this region and the Presidential Library have successfully developed close cooperation aimed at preserving and promoting the historical and cultural heritage of Russia.\n\nYuri Nosov, the Director General of the Presidential Library, presented a video at the plenary session of the Second International Scientific and Practical Conference State and Prospects for the Development of the International State System of Scientific and Technical Information, which was held in Minsk from 13 to 15 August 2024."
