        "text": "The history of the organization of the ChemReactor conference goes back to the 60s of the last century, during the formation of the largest scientific center of our country — the Novosibirsk Academgorodok. The creative atmosphere that reigned in the scientific community allowed the birth of ideas that set the direction of progress and development for many years to come. The founder of the idea of organizing small workshops for specialists in chemical engineering was an outstanding scientist in the field of mathematical modeling of chemical processes and the kinetics of catalytic reactions, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an employee of the Institute of Catalysis, Professor M.G. Slinko.\n\nGradually, these meetings grew into national conferences, and since 1998, the event began to attract leading foreign scientists. The first international conferences of ChemReactor were held in Russian cities — Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Kazan. Large scientific and cultural centers of various states became the venue for the organization of subsequent events. In 2001, the first ChemReactor-15 conference outside our country was held in Helsinki, 120 people from 15 countries of the world took part in it. Then, in Berlin in 2003, the ChemReactor-16 conference was held; DECHEMA (Germany), the Ministry of Industry, Science and Technology of the Russian Federation, the European Federation of Chemical Engineering, the Scientific Council on Catalysis of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Roszarubezhtsentr, the Russian Center of International Scientific and Cultural Cooperation in Berlin took part in its organization (Berlin, Germany).\n\nIn the same years, the scientific profile of the ChemReactor conference was formed. The subject includes four main sections: new fundamental scientific achievements in the field of theoretical foundations of chemical engineering, development of chemical processes and new reactors, chemical reactors and technologies for targeted applications, advanced reactors and technologies for energy-related applications. Much attention in the conference program is traditionally given to technologies for environmental protection, synthesis of new products and highly efficient processing of hydrocarbon raw materials.\n\nAfter that, ChemReactor conferences began to be held regularly, once every 2 years, in various European cities:\n\n● ChemReactor-17 Athens, Greece, 2006\n\n● ChemReactor-18 Malta, 2008\n\n● ChemReactor-19 Vienna, Austria, 2010\n\n● ChemReactor-20 Luxembourg, 2012\n\n● ChemReactor-21 Delft, the Netherlands, 2014\n\n● ChemReactor-22 London, Great Britain, 2016\n\n● ChemReactor-23 Ghent, Belgium, 2018\n\n● ChemReactor-24 was supposed to be held in Milan, Italy, 2020, however, due to the pandemic, it was held online in 2021.\n\nAll these conferences were held by the Boreskov Institute of Catalysis SB RAS together with leading European Universities from the top hundred of the world ranking, such as Delft University of Technology, University College London, Ghent University, Polytechnic University of Milan. The chair of the conference is traditionally Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor Alexander Noskov. The composition of the ChemReactor International Scientific Committee includes the world’s leading scientists in the field of chemical reaction engineering. The head of this Committee for many years has been the Vice-President of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Chair of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Academician, Professor Valentin Parmon.\n\nOver the past quarter of a century, the ChemReactor conference has developed into a high-level international scientific event. On average, 200−250 scientists and technicians from 30−40 countries took part in each such event.\n\nAccording to the professional community assessment, this conference is one of the three most significant in Europe in the field of chemical engineering, and is also known throughout all over the world. ChemReactor is included in the list of events held under the auspices of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE). The proceedings of the conference were traditionally published in a Special Issue of the Chemical Engineering Journal, which today is the world’s leading publication in the field of chemical engineering (1st publication quartile, impact factor 16.7).\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that such an international success of the Russian scientific conference is a unique event in the history of Russian science in the 21st century, the number of comparable events of this level is calculated in units.\n\nIt was assumed that in 2022 the next conference of ChemReactor-25 was to be held in Germany. Unfortunately, this turned out to be impossible for geopolitical reasons. Nevertheless, the organizers decided not to interrupt the established successful tradition and offer to hold ChemReactor-25 in Tyumen. This choice is logical, because the Tyumen region is known as a region with a powerful industry in the field of petrochemistry, gas chemistry and hydrocarbon processing, as well as an actively developing science and education in the field of chemical engineering."
