        "text": "MOSCOW, November 26. /TASS/. Experts from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation have revealed that the Russian Siberian city of Tyumen took the number one rating nationwide as far as quality of living goes, according to a survey published on the university’s website on Monday.\n\n\"The quality of life assessment is based on the results of this year’s sociological studies that have been conducted in 78 cities across the country with a population of over 250,000 people. In addition, official figures from the state statistics service, Rosstat, along with other data on the population’s sentiment in those Russian cities have been used for the evaluation of living standards,\" according to the document.\n\nTyumen is ranked first among the top ten Russian cities. Grozny came in second, trailed by Moscow. Others also making it the top ten were Kazan, Sochi, Yekaterinburg, St. Petersburg, Cherepovets, Tula, and Surgut.\n\nThe final quality-of-life index in Russian cities is based on the following criteria. The quality of medical care, the condition of roads, the development of culture and education, the work of housing and utility services and local governments, the public’s evaluation of their daily conveniences, migration sentiment, and also the self-assessment of their incomes."
