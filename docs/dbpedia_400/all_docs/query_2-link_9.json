It is situated on both banks of the Tura River at its crossing by the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Founded in 1586, it is the oldest Russian city in Siberia, located on the site of a Tatar town, Chingi-Tura, founded in the 14th century. A river port, it functions as a transshipment point. Its main industries are metalworking, engineering, shipbuilding, timber products, and chemicals. The city grew rapidly after the discovery of oil and gas farther to the north in Western Siberia. Pop. (2006 est.) 542,463."
