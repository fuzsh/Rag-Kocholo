Krasnoyarsk Region is the second largest region in the country, covering the mind-boggling 2 366 797 square kilometers. The road to Tulun is going through many small villages, and one can vividly imagine what determination, skills and stamina this kind of journey required back in the day, when these parts were less developed.\n\nDay 22. Tulun - Irkutsk. Distance: 400 km\n\nAnother 400 kilometers, and we reach Irkutsk. The capital of Eastern Siberia, the historic Irkutsk, is by far the most popular stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway between Moscow and the Far East. Irkutsk, like most Siberian cities, appeared in the middle of the 17th century and was founded as military winter quarters at the mouth of the Irkut River. The oldest buildings, dating back to the 18th century, represent a unique style; we call it the Siberian or Irkutsk baroque.\n\nDay 23. Irkutsk – Olkhon Island. Distance: 300 km\n\nToday, we will finally see the main beauty that Siberia gifted us, Lake Baikal. We will also visit the village of Khuzhir, which has experienced a serious tourist boom over the last few years. In the evening, you will enjoy a walking tour to Cape Burkhan, considered the symbol of the island. This place is also often called the Shamanka rock, as shamans of Siberia have conducted their rituals here since prehistoric times. For a long time, ordinary residents, women especially, were forbidden to enter these grounds.\n\nDay 24. Olhon Island - Irkutsk. Distance: 300 km\n\nIn the morning, we will again enjoy the view of the lake and, if time allows, explore Cape Khoboy (‘fang’ in the Buryat language). This is the northernmost point of Olkhon island, a place of extraordinary energy and beauty. Here, you can see the widest part of Lake Baikal, stretching for 80 km. We visit the most attractive and picturesque spots, such as Cape Sagan-Khushun, the Sandy tract and Cape Shunte, which is also called the Cape of Love. Return to Irkutsk.\n\nDay 25. Irkutsk\n\nIn Irkutsk, we conduct a technical inspection of our vehicles. We will get acquainted with the life of the indigenous peoples of the Baikal region: the Buryats, the Evenks, the Tophov. We see some exquisite examples of local wooden architecture, dating back to 1600-1900s, old manors, a parochial school, the Spasskaya Passage Tower and the Kazan Church of the Ilimsky Prison. In total, the collection of the renowned Taltsy Museum boasts more than 20 thousand exhibits..\n\nPart 5. Irkutsk – Vladivostok. Distance: 3850 km\n\nThis part is probably dedicated to overcoming the huge expanses of Russia. Every day of this segment might seem a challenge, you are in for a great accomplishment. Different types and conditions of terrain, the weather may change rapidly, as well as the colours of landscapes - in short, you are now the true masters of conquering distances and surmounting obstacles.\n\nWe are approaching the Far East… the edge of the continent.\n\nDay 26. Irkutsk – Ulan-Ude. Distance: 450 km.\n\nNext destination is Buryatia - the land that is close to Mongolia and China, with a population quite different from what would expect in Russia.\n\nPart of the road will be driven along Lake Baikal, and some awesome views are guaranteed. In addition, we will pass a small Baikal city, known for its famous ski resort, Mount Sobolinaya, in winter, and it delicious strawberries in summer.\n\nWe pay a visit to the Baikal Museum, where loads of information about the lake are stored.\n\nDay 27. Ulan-Ude - Chita. Distance: 580 km\n\nThe Buryats practice Buddhism, which is rather unique for Russia. In the morning, we will go to Ivolginsky Datsan, the most renowned place of worship in these parts, and take a tour of the vicinity.y\n\nIt will take us another 9 hours to get to Chita, located deep in Siberia, surrounded by hills on the shore of a lake. It was here that the Decembrists (followed by their wives) were exiled in 1827 after the failed coup in St.Petersburg, and many places here are also associated with the legend of Genghis Khan. It is also home to Mount Pallas, which marks the watershed between the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nDay 28. Chita - Chernyshevsk. Distance: 310 km\n\nToday we are heading to Chernyshevsk, an ordinary Russian town with a population of only 12,000 people. This is what most cities in this area look like; small houses, questionable roads and wild surroundings… Still, they definitely have their own charm.\n\nDay 29. Chernyshevsk - Skovorodino. Distance: 620 km\n\nA meditative road among the picturesque hills - another long day to endure. We’ll have some decent rest in the evening.\n\nDay 30. Skovorodino - Uglegorsk. Distance 445 km\n\nToday, we will drive towards one of the most mysterious cities in Russia, Uglegorsk (‘city of coal’). Surprisingly, coal has never been mined here. This name was given to fool the potential enemy, covering the construction of missile silos, disguised as coal mining.\n\nOn December 30, 2015, the city was renamed Tsiolkovsky (in the name of a renowned scientist), as the new Vostochny (Eastern) spaceport was constructed nearby. The city's infrastructure is developing rapidly to become one of the most modern settlements in the Amur region, serving the needs of the spaceport personnel and their families.\n\nDay 31. Uglegorsk – Khabarovsk. Distance: 770 km\n\nThe longest part of the road. We may call it ‘rising to the challenge’. We have to overcome about 800 km, so as we arrive to Khabarovsk, most people on the team will probably only dream about dropping in bed and sleeping it off. We are now officially in the Far East.\n\nDay 32. Rest in Khabarovsk\n\nWe will spend the whole day walking around the city. A cruise along the Amur River is obviously a must. In general, we will enjoy the penultimate city on our long journey\n\nDay 33. Khabarovsk –Vladivostok. Distance: 756 km\n\nThe last of the long bits we need to cover, once again driving for more than 700 km (approximately 8-10 hours). We finally reach the shore of the Pacific Ocean late in the evening. Vladivostok welcomes us with true oriental hospitality.\n\nDay 34. Vladivostok - Russky Island - Tokorevsky lighthouse. Distance: 60 km\n\nThe complex terrain, the port, the salty sea air, all of this makes each coastal city unique and different from the rest. Vladivostok was included in the list of ten cities with the most beautiful views of the sea by the National Geographic magazine.\n\nVladivostok is gorgeous during the day — in sunny weather, it impresses with the bottomless blue sky and the bright sun. The bridge over the Golden Horn Bay is a definite symbol of development and progress. Vladivostok at night is fascinating, as thousands of lights are reflected in the water surface.\n\nTo mark the end of our journey, we will cross the Eastern Bosphorus strait by the marvelous bridge with a central span of 1,104 metres (3,622 feet), the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world, to reach Russky Island and make sure we have reached the easternmost region in Russia that could be reached by car.\n\nWe return to the city and end our journey at the Tokarevsky Lighthouse, a landmark we chose to symbolise hope for future amazing experiences.\n\nDays 35. Vladivostok\n\nWe are resting, sharing the emotions and wishing farewell to the members of our glorious, who depart one by one. It is also time to ship our vehicles back home*.\n\nWe wish you a safe journey home and hope to see you again on another fantastic adventure in Russia.\n\n(*please contact us by phone/email for shipping details and procedures)"
