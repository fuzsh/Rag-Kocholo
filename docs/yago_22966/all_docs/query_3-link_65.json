        "text": "(1880–1928). American singer Nora Bayes was popular in the early 1900s in musical revues, most notably the Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nBayes was born Dora Goldberg in 1880 in Joliet, Illinois. She began her career in Chicago, Illinois, in 1899 and made her Broadway debut in 1901. She was identified with the songs “Down Where the Wurzburger Flows” (1902) and “Shine on, Harvest Moon” (1908), which were written by her husband, Jack Norworth. Norworth was her singing partner during their marriage (1908–13). During World War I Bayes introduced George M. Cohan’s famous song “Over There. ” In 1919 a New York theater was named for her. Bayes died on March 19, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York."
