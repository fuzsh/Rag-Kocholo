        "text": "Sixteen92 and Ajevie\n\nWe all have those guilty pleasure films that may not have been seen as cinematic gold in others' eyes but for you, you can't get enough of those certain types of mind-rotting-entertainment. It's candy for the brain and Jawbreaker (1999), is one of my ultimate guilty pleasure movies that matches perfectly to those criteria. Let me take you back and remind you a bit of time trip...(come on, indulge an old lady, this is all I have)\n\nWe are at the final days of a millennium about to celebrate a full century of innovation, growth and advancements in technology (we aren't quite panicking just yet about changing over the 000's in our computer systems or Y2K Computer Bug- that comes in a few months and I slept right through New Years), medicine and industry (Oh Napster released that year!) etc and hey roller rinks and Butterfinger BBs still exist. There are strobbing silver lights, boy bands in baggy clothing, thumping night club scenes, bleached tips, and metallic clothing (plus lots of white pants) in about every music video and there's Madonna dancing with Austin Powers. It was a fun time for sure especially for those of us just learning our tastes with our cd players and which vhs tapes to grab at Blockbuster. It was a wide range of genres of movies that year but for me, Jawbreaker somehow captured that magical time what with the flashy pin-up 1950's styled clothing in daring neons mixed so perfectly with the 1990's grudge goth aesthetic (did anyone else race out to try to find a purple neckerchief and a nail polish named 'decay' or 'demented'?) and the quirky bubblegum murder meangirl plot serving as the body (ha!) of the film, it was hard not to love it, quote it and still think about. Enter Sixteen92 in the summer of 2020 announcing the grand reveal of the Summer 6th Anniversary collection. One look and I knew what I was bringing home.\n\nOne Note At A Time:\n\nBEAUTIFUL. POPULAR. LOVED. FEARED. (Moonflower, tiare, bitter almond, blond woods, heat lightning, asphalt)\n\nIn the film there are scenes of transformation and lovely manipulation at play and this perfume begins with the turn of the sun on wet bedraggled green sprouts that with attention would dominate a garden of followers er flowers. Very clever. The bitter almond and intoxicating white florals just lie under the all illuminating sun then all reveals the dangerous poisonous side that is still highly addictive and impossible to not be drawn to. I thankfully don't get any asphalt but there is a nifty morphing impression of metal in this perfume that hits out of the blue, just like a betrayal from someone you so wanted to believe and idolize.\n\nHAVE YOU MET VYLETTE? (Shy violet, pale leather, soft patchouli, fiddlehead fern, white rose, a crack of black pepper)\n\nOn opening a familiar realistic greenhouse fern note from Serres d'Auteuil greets the nose along with a sweetness of a fresh white rose then ever slowly this perfume spins in some seductive leather, violet and punch of black pepper that adds underlying warmth and viola instant mysterious popularity on my vanity table. Have You Met Vylette? was made for us wallflowers that have a secret side that we just a nudge to reveal. Remember my fellow wallflowers, we hold the power and on a clear day, baby you can see tomorrow.\n\nPEACHY F-CKING KEEN (Peach preserves, white nectarine, black raspberry, syrupy benzoin, vanilla musk, rum)\n\nSo who wants to sashay about smelling like a Fuzzy Navel drink? Those devilishly deceptive (though delicious) soft cocktails get me in trouble at weddings so unless I'm home and 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' or 'Hurricane' is thumping in the background, I can't wear this out as I amp this little number to the heavens and back and my coworkers would think I'm a lush, haha. I do love the spiked peach and additional dark fruit in this and appreciate it doesn't turn to raunchy cat urine on me, the listed vanilla musk will unexpectedly reappear in another purchased blend that I will get to rambling about in awhile. Overall, this is a Friday night or Saturday type of scent when you are up to no good and feel like strutting down a hallway like you own the burning world even in your pajamas.\n\nTHE PRINCESS DI OF REAGAN HIGH (Coconut milk, star jasmine, pink birthday cake, warm honey, white amber)\n\nThe Princess Di of Reagan High was the reigning queen of my summer fragrances in 2020 but she also can make a delightful cameo appearance now and again in the cold cruel months as the sweet, bright and delectable notes help banish the winter blahs and distract me from the looming 5-foot snowdrifts out my window. When it comes this perfume the coconut milk has thankfully mellowed and softened even more after all these months and the strawberry almond vanilla cake with drizzled golden honey and a warm white amber base shines through and tempts me to whip up a thick strawberry cake from scratch for the neighbors just because. The crunchy sugary topping is amping with lovely intensity this morning and stokes some hidden impulse to spread joy around, be liked by the community and put frills and ruffles on (again) just because and stick my head out the frozen over window risking serious wind rash and whistle to the birds so they could help me bake (they would probably tweet back some type of obscenity about it not being spring yet and stop bothering them). Yes, my fellow gloomy little hearts, this perfume makes you want to feel and be kind and want to turn into a crazed Snow White others would probably want to kill (use with caution).\n\nPROM QUEEN (White chrysanthemum, sticky honeysuckle, cherry limeade, red lollipop, smudged mascara, innocent cashmere, blood accord)\n\nI mentioned smelling and feeling like a crazed Snow White how about a demented Prom Queen with a big secret? Now at first this vial when it initially arrives is sickeningly sweet and tart with the cherry limeade and candy swirling underneath and an absence of any listed florals, but give Prom Queen several months of gentle aging and she will reveal her freaky even dare I say kinky side. For me, this one still opens with playful sticky sweet tartness of a melting popsicle then something sinister just hiding under the faux exterior of candy reveals in about an hour realistic floral petals, wet makeup and a tang of copper blood! This is the first time I have smelled realistic blood in a Sixteen92 scent creation and I love it and wish it to be found more in this indie's catalogue. There is also something to akin to draping material as well I can detect and I totally get the scent story of Prom Queen now.\n\nI KILLED THE TEEN DREAM (Vanilla bean ice cream, pink spun sugar and marshmallow, white cake crumbs, candied citron, a cracked jawbreaker, duct tape and gunpowder)\n\nAnd the award goes to for the most unique candy themed perfume I have ever smelled...Wowza! I Killed The Teen Dream (deal with it) is a wild ride. It's playful and inviting yet (cleverly) deceptively unnerving and twisted underneath perfectly matching the opening sequence and scenes of Jawbreaker. On me, the almost powdery creamy layer of candy shells and delicate citron amplifies first and the unmistakable aroma of sticky chemical glue from duct tape shortly follows. I don't get any gunpowder or ice cream which is a little disappointing, however, I do get Sixteen92's infamous mouthwatering marshmallow accord and it replaces the citron and lasts well into the next morning along with the return of a candy shell that reminds me of nostalgic easter baskets. I knew this perfume was going to be off the wall but I didn't expect anything like this and this is why Indies exist- to create one of kind scent potions that not only tell a commanding story but hit all the senses. No one else could have brought this type of perfume to life. Brava, Sixteen92!\n\nThey F**ing Forgot My Birthday (Wedding cake, orange blossom honey, burned sugar, soft vanilla musk, unlit birthday candles, would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?)\n\nHere it is THE scent that launched a thousand reviews and set the indie world ablaze last year and it smells like I'm being smothered by 90's powdery sweet My Little Pony toys. Great. Sadly, this was the biggest disappointment purchase of 2020 for me and I'm still cursing out my skin chemistry every time I take this coveted bottle out to test hoping this will be the day the stunning wedding cake with buttercream icing and orange blossoms will stand firm against the onslaught of a cascade of warm powdery plastic (that I'm guessing is from the \"unlit birthday candles\" mingling with the vanilla musk), but alas, every time it's the same outcome of me just enveloped within moments and being laid low for a full day (and half if I don't scrub fast enough) with a pinching headache. This bottle has taught me so many things and the number one lesson is, I need to be more picky in 2021.\n\n*reviews composed in May and June 2020\n\nI'm in a bit of silly (and hungry) mood when I'm in the presence of these oils (and names!) so just indulge me. *hums then busts out in song* I found someone to take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness (about missing out on banana and cucumber perfumes)! Any Cher fans here or more importantly any excited Nui Cobalt Designs fans present because I have some ramblings to share.\n\n*Thank you so much, Forest and Josh, for allowing me to sample these collections!\n\nOne Note At A Time:\n\nPower Down (A relaxing potion of labdanum and silken white sandalwood adorned with delicate lavender buds and a wisp of clary sage. Anoint your pulse points to alleviate stress, restore your peace of mind, and help you unwind.)\n\nOn first application Power Down reminds me of another delightful relaxing creation by Nui Cobalt called Tryptophan with a caramel-like butteriness present, but that slight impression disappears as few moments in, an unexpected fizzy lavender aroma appears and pulls my nose down to my wrist to stay. I'm still learning to identify resins so I apologize if the \"fizzy\" description sounds odd, it smells almost lemony without a trace of bitterness or a pucker-quality if you will, mixed with freshly harvested lavender buds. The listed sage arrives after the long dry down and completes the picture of witchy relaxation.\n\nCharisma Bonus (A seriously sexy fragrance to ensnare the objects of your desire. Spiced black patchouli languishing in vanilla honey with scattered ylang petals and catnip leaves. Wear this potion to make an excellent first impression, to capture the attention of influential people, or to inspire passion during amorous encounters.)\n\nYou would think by now I would be able to identify ylang or could completely fully break down every note composition with one wave of the wrist, not so as these oils continue to retain and hide their secrets and I'm perfectly content with still being in awe with these types of blends. So with saying that, Charisma Bonus smells like spiced vanilla and dark honey that goes into the seductive mysterious realm versus landing in a gourmand area and this is what secretly I was hoping Sultry would have smelled like on me. My old friend patchouli anchors this medley and keeps the longevity of Charisma Bonus going for a full 15 hours on my skin and I know sandalwood isn't listed, but something is reminding me of fine wood in Charisma Bonus and a unique vintage quality is noticeable as well; they don't make fragrances like this anymore. For wearability, I won't waste this spicy little number on those at work, this is meant to entice and then conquer.\n\nBollocks 2020 (An indulgent scent to help you keep a sense of humor when dealing with liars. Banoffee Pie: golden toffee conjured from sweetened condensed milk, sauteed spiced bananas, and a crumbly crust of butter biscuits.)\n\nWhat it says on the tin and this is an indulgence that has certainly surprised me as a first for myself, I now have a banana perfume to recommend! Nothing is nauseating or obnoxiously candy-like in Bollocks and on me, I get a soft wash of pure diced banana on top of vanilla toffee pudding and decadent buttery crushed graham crackers. Everything is incredibly realistic smelling and I'm thrilled that as lovely as the banana is it backs away and then fades letting the spiced buttery graham cracker come forward. The more I sniff the more I love this fragrance and I'm so happy I tried something out of my comfort zone.\n\nOdin's Eye (A powerful blend for wisdom and strategy. Iced blueberry, cedarwood, birch, crushed peppercorn, cardamom, frozen musk and white amber. Anoint pulse points and Third Eye to ignite the fire of the mind and access cosmic knowledge.)\n\nIn the vial, intoxicating blueberries hit my nose and I almost spill my entire sample in my excitement to slather this blend (I'm weak for a good berry note and Nui Cobalt's has some of the best fruit accords). Once slowly applied the realistic blueberry rises along with masculine cedar with a hint of spice and I'm swept away to visions of enjoying cold freshly picked blueberries under towering ancient trees with a Viking warrior. Oh, Odin's Eye is a wink and nod to naughty imaginings! I think I found a new scent potion to add to the sleep and relaxation drawer of my collection.\n\nBlarney (A bracing scent to steel your nerves and keep you calm in the face of mendacity. Irish Breakfast Tea: the warm, tannic comfort of proper Cuppa sweetened just enough with a touch of honey and smoothed with cream.)\n\nI'm still a tea novice so I can't comment on how true Blarney smells of Irish Breakfast Tea, but I do get the familiar scent of black tea and a clean citrus undernote. There is a unique historical element to Blarney that turns my head when I'm going about my day and I know exactly where to feature this blend when the times comes. As this oil is aging more of the honey and cream appears after a few hours overall making this a lovely soothing scent, perfect for a rainy day like today.\n\nSophistry (A refreshingly tart aroma to wake you up and get you going. Chilled sparkling lemonade infused with elderflower blossoms, thinly sliced cucumber, and a pinch of grated ginger root. Wear to guard against fatigue and burnout.)\n\nIt has taken me weeks to figure out what this blend smells like on me and I finally have it- rained over cucumber vines in the garden! It's uncanny how true Sophistry smells of my memories of being asked to bring in an armful of cucumbers from our home garden, I can even smell the realistic dark skin of the vegetable. I didn't think it was possible to capture that distinct peppery green aroma, but there it is and not one recall of soap to note, this is an unexpected atmospheric. A few hours after dabbing on Sophistry, the tart-sweet lemonade appears along with a delicate floral and I'm falling for this perfume. This smells like summer country gardening to me and I'll be reaching for it in the hotter months. I need to stop fearing cucumber (and banana) and need to start collecting more of those blends now from Nui Cobalt Designs.\n\nFlim Flam (A beautifully balanced concoction to ease anxiety and calm the mind. Lush Phillipine mango with steamed sticky rice and a decadent drizzle of coconut syrup. Wear to settle down, center yourself, and see with clarity.)\n\nHow intriguing! This really does smell like steamed rice, fruit and coconut. If I were to ever go to a beach I would wear Flim Flam with its playful tropical elements. I don't have anything that smells like this in my collection, what a find. I was admittedly a tad concerned that the mango was behaving like peach does on my skin at first but thankfully it settled right down and melded very prettily with the starchy wet rice and smooth coconut adding just a little punch of fruit. I can see why Flim Flam is becoming a run away smash of the April Fool's 2020 collection.\n\nHorsefeathers 2020 (A sumptuous scent to help you keep your cool when people try to pull the wool over your eyes. A traditional Arctic Roll: vanilla bean ice cream wrapped in a blanket of yellow sponge cake and a layer of vibrant red raspberry jam.)\n\n*I am lucky enough to have also the 2019 version and I cannot tell the difference.\n\nCan I just say that this shop executes gourmands beautifully and Horsefeathers is another where I could lick my arm. In the vial, this one is a bit syrupy smelling versus spreadable jam but once Horsefeathers has a few moments to settle on my skin this oil takes on a buttery cake quality with freshly crushed raspberries spread on top and it quickly shoots to one of the top raspberry cake perfumes I have tried. I tend to amplify the buttery cake with decadent raspberry jam but hours later a clear vanilla ice cream aroma wafts up from my wrists and makes me dance in my chair. A great introductory perfume to this magical house of fragrance and I plan to gift a coworker (who has been fortunate enough to travel to the UK and dine on some of these desserts from the April Fool's Collection) with one of these vials as she loves raspberry scents and all things bakery themed. Fingers crossed I finally will have someone to go indie shopping with and can get excited with (even mark our calendars) over new perfume releases. Spreading the Indie Love one stunner at a time!\n\nYemaya (Mother Ocean, Protectress of Children and Guardian of the Home. We honor you with ocean air and sea foam sweetened with coconut, pound cake, and fresh watermelon.)\n\nAnother fruit laced blend that is as it says on the tin. I get every listed note with Yemaya and the watermelon is freshly sliced hunks dripping juice (no jolly rancher candy here which I was worried about). I went for a walk wearing this perfume and I immediately snapped my head and nose to attention when a surprise salty whipped cream note appeared after 30 minutes. I have never been to or seen an actual ocean or beach but I could easily imagine a romantic victorian-esque painting of gaily decorated attendees having a brunch of sliced watermelon, pound cake with shaved coconut and one couple sneaking off to lick whipped cream off each other's hands as they stare at the rolling waves. A full 2 hours later, Yemaya curiously reminds me of a salty Robin's Egg (I think it's the whipped cream and vanilla). Just lovely.\n\nAchievement Unlocked (A bold blend of Mahogany and Merlot with tart elderberry and a single long-stemmed rose. Wear this sumptuous scent to amplify your confidence and hone your skills. Anoint the tools of your trade to move you swiftly toward success.)\n\nIn the vial and on opening Achievement Unlocked smells similar to my beloved Exsanguinated, however, the mahogany amplifies more in this oil making this oil more of a brother scent of Under the Mistletoe if I search my notes. I do get a beautiful bloom of realistic rose (complete with promised green stem) about 2 hours after application and the elderberry adds a boozy mix to this oil that I enjoy. I'm still overall undecided on Achievement Unlocked to be completely honest. It's a keeper, I'm just not sure where to place it in the box for wear.\n\nPoppycock (A bright fragrance to banish confusion and illuminate the whole truth. Lemon Meringue Pie: frothy citrus sweetness in a toasted almond crust, with white vanilla peaks gently browned under a blowtorch).\n\nPoppycock is a sugary lemon scent confection that shifts to varying degrees of desserts on my wrists and crooks of my arms. It's not waxy or sharp and I get either vanilla cake with decorative swirls of citrus or textbook perfect whipped lemon meringue with a crunchy almond shell. The longevity is also impressive as this scent fades in about 4 to 5 hours on my skin making this the longest-lasting lemon dessert perfume I have found yet for myself (usually lemon dessert oils are gone on me before I leave the house). There is also a distinct heavenly smoke note with toasted almonds that is last to leave me for the night.\n\nHoodwink (A soothing scent for rest and replenishment. A tall glass of Thai iced tea sweetened with Tupelo honey and swirled with vanilla rice milk. Wear for relaxation and to get a good night’s sleep.)\n\nOh my, Hoodwink is going to be another smash hit, I know it. On me, I get bright floral/pollen honey with distinct brewed black tea and vanilla (something reminding me of an expensive latte in the mix as well) all in the background. It also stays close which is ideal for work as I can sniff to my heart's content and be taken away with this soothing medley. As the hours tick by, this perfume turns more creamy and dreamy completing this summertime escape fragrance. I adore this and Forest is the Queen of Tea Scents in my book!\n\nArctic Fox (A sexy little number to inspire snuggles on the coldest nights. Soft amber nestled in sumptuous cashmere, steamed rice milk, winter white musk, and snow-covered fir trees.)\n\nAnother vial I'm not entirely sure about as when applied I receive, soft white soap and a hint of pine. I was hoping for warm milk and amber with pine needles, to be honest. As Arctic Fox sits on the skin, more of a creamy powderiness reveals itself and I may just hang onto this vial until next winter and try again. There is something about this oil I love (perhaps the cool creaminess and amber?)\n\nBibliophilia (The love of Books.The vanillic scent of aging paper, the tang of fresh ink, venerable bookshelves of oak and mahogany, a sweet trace of pipe tobacco, an undercurrent of faded leather. Wear this subtle potion to invoke spirits of arcane knowledge and empower your perceptions.)\n\nI mean this all in the best way, this smells like what I could only imagine the desk and library of Agatha Christie or Jessica Fletcher to smell like. I get the metallic tang of real typewriter ink, the unmistakable vanillic aroma of a stack of aged papers and realistic worn leather from a well-thumbed tome. There is also a vintage perfume-esque undernote that makes me think of the contents of an old black leather handbag laying on a side chair. I want to go reread a classic murder mystery now! Another impressive and oddly soothing blend from this collection.\n\nLoot (This time-honored formula attracts wealth from hidden and unexpected sources. It's an excellent assistant in acquiring assets, both monetary and otherwise. Use to greatly increase the flow of wealth into your life, especially in financially dire situations. It has a particular penchant for landing those dream jobs that seem out of reach. Loot is handcrafted and charged as the Aries moon trines Jupiter in Sagittarius. This celestial connection opens doors that didn't exist and lights the path to affluence. Bayberry bark and dragon's blood with Ceylon cinnamon and two luxuriant vanillas.* Do not apply to skin if you are sensitive to cinnamon.)\n\nI fully admit I went a bit wild over Loot when it arrived as it was a unique heavenly cinnamon and rich bayberry bark bomb I wanted to pour over my head but alas gentle aging has tamed this beast and it's sadly a bit forgettable now. That's not the point though and I'm going to keep this oil home and sprinkle it in my unscented whipped soap at different points of the year. The history and preparation of this blend are fascinating to read about.\n\nLiquid Luck (Made with wild-harvested four-leaf clovers, this potion confers great good fortune upon its wearer. A gorgeously green bouquet of night air and dewy grass, charmed galbanum and benzoin, Irish moss, carrot seed, living shamrock and freshly turned earth.)\n\nIn the vial and on my skin I get sunshine warmed clover and wet morning moss. It calls back to some play sessions out in the garden as a child just with my back being cushioned by bouncy green growth and staring at scuttling clouds and rainbow shifting coloured bubbles dancing on the winds. Liquid Luck is a comforting hug of nature and innocent times you desperately wish you could revisit. As this oil sits on the skin it sweetens then on me the carrot seed comes out to play before fading at the 3 hour mark. I'm hoping to find I will have better luck with this blend in my hair and I can smell like those clover, queen anne's lace and daisy chain coronets I remember knotting together after I recovered a special key from my grandfather's garage and escaped to my own secret garden (that was only an old rusty spider-webbed covered door on the side of the shed no one ever used). Anyone else still refer to young tree branches as \"wick\"? Wow, I haven't thought about those garden ventures in decades, Liquid Luck truly is something special and conjures some unexpected smiles.\n\nHumbuggery (An uplifting scent to keep you impervious to deception and shielded from malice. Pineapple Upside Down Cake: a delicious juxtaposition of tang and sweetness, caramelized pineapple, coconut cream, toasted hazelnut crust and baked brown sugar.)\n\nI wasn't expecting to be hit with so much personal nostalgia with these new collections, but I'm very thankful for being reminded of happier times and those that have passed. My pap loved pineapple upside down cake and Humbuggery is a spot-on representation of that distinct dessert fragrance. It's sticky yellow cake draped in golden pineapple slices, shaved coconut that later becomes custardy with the soggy parts of the bottom of the cake and a tropical sweetness hanging in the air I fondly remember as my pappy sat at the head of the wooden table with that mischievous side grin (we both share in pictures). A gentle giant in my mind and how I wish this scent would linger a little longer on my skin. More of the coconut amplifies by 4 hours and then the final note is lovely crumbs of realistic yellow cake. A nice send off. I wish I loved pineapple, but that scent for me is more about the sentimental properties it holds versus pure enjoyment.\n\nShenanigans (A richly sensual blend for grounding and stabilizing. German Schichttorte: a sumptuous confection of layered yellow cake touched with lemon zest and rum, glazed with apricot and finished with a cloak of dark chocolate. Wear when you need to stay present and focused on the here-and-now.)\n\nOh, the children have been put to bed and someone has been baking some wicked vanilla rum cake with a dark shiny glaze of chocolate and dotted with apricot pieces. This one is BOOZE, CAKE and APRICOT on me, whew this one is heavy on the rum. I guess I learned something new with Shenanigans as I amplify alcohol notes and ah, the name just hit me because whoever would indulge in this decadent cake would be surely up to some shenanigans they may not recall the next morning or afternoon. Ha. Now that's clever storytelling with the notes and name. As fun and a bit wicked the opening is the final dry down is marvellous, smelling of thick yellow cake with apricots on me and I love this final shift of the notes before they fade completely at the 6-hour mark.\n\nRoguery (A tres chic scent to remind you of your effortless intrinsic fabulousness. Kouign Amann: a light and elegant puff pastry that takes the simplicity of buttered sugar rolls to the height of sophistication. Wear for a boost of confidence, comfort, and radiant self-esteem.)\n\nAlbeit a wonderous realistic bread aroma, Roguery isn't the baked fragrance I have been searching years for. Roguery smells more of hot buttered golden topped rolls fresh from the oven and for me, I may have a bit of fun and layer this with some pumpkin desserts and see if anyone notices. I also get a hit of possible anise or almond (something reminding me of a subtle bite of liquorice). I'm going to keep this savoury buttered oil home and slather it on for sleep.\n\nHindsight (An energizing blend to strengthen the memory. Green tea, galangal, rosemary, sandalwood, and nutmeg. Wear to invigorate the intellect and banish brain fog. It is particularly helpful when the mind is scattered by fatigue.)\n\nJust as I found in Higher Mind 2019, this an oil to grab when I want to put my thinking-cap on and get work done. This is a citrus spice and distinct scent of rosemary to Hindsight that grabs my immediate attention and I think I have indeed found a sister scent to Higher Mind 2019. The Green Tea adds a tannic zip to the base notes of sandalwood and nutmeg; never resembling soap. Everything is so well blended and I can't wait to stick my nose into a vial of Lightning Bug which also has green tea listed.\n\nBamboozle (A sweet scent for hope and optimism. Baklava: diaphanous layers of flakey, golden pastry, toasted pistachio, roasted chestnut, crushed almond, and a generous drizzle of spring harvest honey. Wear to banish discouragement and brighten dispositions.)\n\nI know in the official video regarding the April Fool's 2020 collection, Forest mentioned she doesn't exactly like doing gourmands, which I can respect but can I say, that is a crying shame because she is so flipping brilliant at that category of fragrances and Bamboozle is another triumph! This oil begins with the distinct aroma of wet nut roll dough then the pistachio, chestnut and almond make up a delicious salty trio of pleasure and I want to lick my wrist. The honey appears a short while later and it does smell flakey and golden. Needless to say, Bamboozle is a winner and one delectable perfume to recommend.\n\nBalderdash (An ebullient scent to lift your mood when the bastards try to get you down. Cherries Jubilee: jewel-bright Montmorency cherries poached in brandy and drizzled while still warm over vanilla ice cream.)\n\nThe true aroma of Cherry is a hard thing to bottle and release in perfume and here in Balderdash, Forest has soothed and conquered the mythical creature as there is not one resemblance of cherry cough syrup in this oil *claps*. Whew, there is some hooch mingled with the realistic cherries though and I think this imaginary baker was taking a strong nip while creating a sweet fruit masterpiece, haha. I can forgive that, it adds a punch and matureness to this perfume, I mean who honestly hasn't taken a nip while they were baking with liquor (one thumbful for the bowl and 3 for the baker, haha). My chemistry must love alcohol notes. The promised vanilla ice cream (along with unlisted coconut?) becomes noticeable on me about an hour later and the longer Balderash is gently aging, the more I love this scent potion and can easily see why it is so popular. Another fruit-scented creation to recommend!\n\nForesight (A mystical blend for prognostication and planning. Angelica, precious saffron, orris root, sage leaves, heliotrope, eyebright, and a subtle touch of star anise. Wear this blend when plotting the course toward big dreams and long-term goals. It has a knack for navigating around potential obstacles and delays.)\n\nIf there was a note I would run away with and marry, it would be star anise (forgive me, pumpkin!). There is some mysterious seductive element to that spice I want to hoard now and forever and on me, anise is the star of the show in Foresight. I love these types of morphing blends, I say that because Foresight starts off smelling cold, green and even like clear stream water with a hint of sassafras then the naughty star anise materializes out of nowhere, hood sweeping back revealing its true side to me and I know this sounds odd, but Foresight is what I could only imagine a rippled dream to smell like (complete with a trace of mystical incense on the edge). Another exciting and surprise favourite. Mmm, everyone can leave me with this one. I'm just missing a huge pile of satin pillows to flop back against and lose myself in as I huff my wrists and hair.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nThe first perfume I opened from Nui Cobalt Designs was Little Brown Rabbit and that sent that single vial sent me of a whirlwind year of collecting and researching all about this magical house of fragrance and here we are a year later with more to add to my little fragrance menagerie. *the following were purchased\n\nOzark Hellbender (A dark and cool blend to honor your uniqueness. Watercress and wild-foraged blueberries slither through damp moss, budding birch trees, raw pecans, and coriander. Wear this fresh, nocturnal scent to invoke calm and clarity.)\n\nThis one is intriguing as promised! I get sugared blueberries, watery greens and a drydown of a mixup of fruit, floral and coriander. To be honest, Ozark Hellbender reminded me a great deal of Bad Moon Rising the first couple of weeks with something in this blend reading as \"violets\" to me with a waxy floral (almost powdery) under the blueberries and herbs- I think it's the birch which I learning I tend to amplify. That all changed as this perfume has morphed to luscious sweet realistic blueberries and aquatic greenery and a dry \"dirty\" coriander under it all creating a fascinating docile watery scent overall. I was fortunate enough to actually hold a Hellbender in highschool and like those nifty creatures (they have the most adorable toes), this fragrance inspired by them is unexpected in how you think it would act. Weird is beautiful!\n\nSpring Peeper (A dynamic blend to wake you up gently and sustain your energy. Warm ginger with saffron, cardamom, coriander, and nutmeg sprinkled over unripe fig and yellow mandarin with a base of mossy mahogany. Wear to stay balanced, focused, and adaptable.)\n\nThe melodic rhythmic chirping of Spring Peepers down in the hollow is the official sign of spring for me and here we have a fragrance that encompasses the essence of meditative night musings and motivational spirit of a persistent little creature. This is warm and inviting with the spices and the woody base is a perfect touch. The fig and bright yellow mandarin are noticeable in the vial and on application however meld into the background and I tend to amplify the warm woody spices. I love to use Spring Peeper for pure relaxation and when I'm listening to this perfume's inspiration long into the night.\n\nLightning Bug (A scent that is vibrant, luminous, and alive. Budding angelica, liatrix, and blue salvia gilded with key lime and lemon verbena over green amber, green tea, and cucumber. Wear when you need to refresh and revitalize.)\n\nLightning Bug is a quasi-atmospheric that on me smells first of realistic wet green grass and fresh (non-soapy) cucumber with peeks of \"light\" and \"glows\" from the citrus, the dry down is warm amber with a vintage twist. This is an elegant representation of summer-night nostalgia and this country girl is very pleased.\n\nSilver Fox (An elegant blend for charm, poise and decorum. White tea with honey and rice milk, almond macaron, soft grey cashmere and cool woodland musk. Wear when you must put your best foot forward and make a positive impression.)\n\nThis perfume exudes a fancy vintage vibe and I'm absolutely smitten. When first applied Silver Fox smells sweet and gentle but still manages to give a good throw as my mother noticed, then 30 minutes the tea announces itself with a tannic nip along with a drop of lemon and a full 2 hours it morphs to soft creamy refinement that smells from another era. It's stunning overall, lasts through a 12-hour shift and reminds me a great deal of a few of my favourite \"your skin but better\" type of sophisticated scent potions by Nui Cobalt.\n\nGrey Wolf (A steely scent for unshakeable courage and impenetrable calm. White sandalwood, black amber, icy sage, cashmere, stone musk, lichen, softly smoked birchwood, grey suede, mountain springwater, and white peppercorn. Wear when you need to remember your strength and own your power.)\n\nGrey Wolf is a fantastic representation of one of my favourite animals. On opening it's cold and a bit sweet smelling with a distinct clean masculine element to this blend. Then the peppercorn melds in with the coolness of the sage, a soft trace of smoke and cashmere I recognize from other treasured vials and bottles from by Nui Cobalt, all creating the impression of a dappled grey, white and black coat slipping from the shadows. A slight greenness of lichen peeks out if I close my eyes and concentrate. For me, the true magic hits when a soft magnetic combination of smokey suede and creamy sandalwood appears on the dry down that reminds me of a great deal of Mourning Veil and Grey Wolf morphs a bit more feminine. You would think all of these listed notes would amplify and overtake a room but Forest does it again, as Grey Wolf is another glowing aura type of blend, that stays close to the skin while somehow projecting your inner self and you feel you can do anything.\n\nWhite-Tailed Deer (A blend for peace, tranquility, and bountiful blessings. Soft brown suede, golden musk, wild forest berries, and roasted chestnuts dusted with maple sugar.)\n\nHere it is, the blend that has blown me away with a magical cream dipped suede aroma on top of a delicious sugary berry nut and textile mixture under it all that makes no sense why it all works BUT it does. White-Tailed Deer also conjures personal memories of my days in the hollow practising archery and I'm under some fantastic spell as I don't want to put this vial down. This blend also works as a sleep scent potion as I huff my wrists and it's off to dreamland and I can still smell the creaminess sweetness 10 hours later. I don't know what could make this perfume any better, perhaps a hint of salt?\n\nNui Cobalt Designs\n\nDelectable scent confections and history, what more could a lady ask for? Perhaps seconds. I should have picked up more dusting powders...but I'm jumping ahead of myself. These are my 2 parcels of springtime fragrant treats combined and ready to be rambled about.\n\nSpray-In Detangler formula- You have heard it once, twice and are about to hear it again about this magic hair elixir that is my holy grail hair product I've been searching for all my life. THIS STUFF WORKS. With my (past) waist length mane, I run through a generous sized bottle about every month and half and I truly receive my full money's worth with these products (I can't stop touching my soft manageable hair now). The longevity on the fragrance varies between each blend, however, I have discovered different fruit and spice based bottles can last days in my hair.\n\nAurelia (Gathered Notes and Description: Delicious ripe raspberries top this lovely, raspberry jam filled, white wedding cake, doused with vanilla cream, topped with dried red rose petals, and with a hint of Sandalwood ambered musk)\n\nLet's start off this long overdue review with showcasing my beloved Aurelia! She is the perfect marriage of gourmand and floral and a must try if you adore realistic raspberries. In the detangler more of the vanilla cream with decadent fruit is pronounced on my locks versus on my skin with the perfume and the rose is just the perfect topping. I can expect one to two days of the aroma of one of the greatest desserts I have had on my plate accompanying me and Aurelia keeps her well deserved crown in my book. She is the fairest smelling of them all and she is finally home!\n\nField of Dreams (Gathered Notes and Description: (formerly Lavender Fields) A blended Amber, with Lavender Kashmir, Lavender absolute, and Lavender (Lavendula Angustifolia Moldova)\n\nI was so tempted to just fill my basket with everything Aurelia this past January and call it a night, but at the last moment I got this impulse to be a bit adventurous and try some new fragrances just for you all. Okay, I also have a weakness for Moona's Lavender oils and when I saw real Lavendula Angustifolia Moldova blended with amber, into the basket Field of Dreams went. This one is soft lavender, I never understood what others meant by a lavender being soft until I spritzed this lovely hair tonic on my head for the first time. It's so dreamy and pretty, however fleeting as the smell hardly lasts a few hours in my hair. I'm definitely placing this one down for next year in some bath products, perfume and dusting powder. Field of Dreams would be a divine sleep fragrance.\n\nPoetry (Gathered Notes and Description: Romance is in the air with this balance of scent between floral, citrus, spice, and resin. Orange blossom cream with an English Toffee swirl and a touch of Frankincense and Ginger.)\n\nAnd with one spray Poetry has joined Nui Cobalt's LOVE as fragrances that transport me into a Pre-Raphaelite painting or a stained glass window. This is a gorgeous work of art and I must grab the perfume and dusting powder next year. The uplifting elegant orange blossom opens the scene then this creamy toffee swirl with a hint of resins and spice appear and completely transforms this scent confection differing itself from the Yule Wonder called Whole. Poetry has more depth and morphing elements than Whole. For longevity oddly Poetry only lasts about 8 to 10 hours versus Whole which still captivates days later. With that said, I need to remember to layer this Tudor-era inspired fragrance; I'm completely okay with that necessity.\n\nArgan Oil Hair Rescue formula- I can't have or recommend the detangler without mentioning the argan oil formula MoonaLisa offers because they are a match made in hair heaven and these products have worked absolute magic on my tresses. I have never had such shiny healthy looking hair. The Argan Oil I use after I have brushed out my mane with the aid of the Detangler then I add a dime size amount of argan oil in different scents to the end of my hair. If I have any excess oil on my hands I flip my hair down and place the excess in the back of my head. I run thru a bottle about every 3 months and they are worth every penny.\n\nAurelia (Gathered Notes and Description: Delicious ripe raspberries top this lovely, raspberry jam filled, white wedding cake, doused with vanilla cream, topped with dried red rose petals, and with a hint of Sandalwood ambered musk)\n\nShe's baack and this time she carries in her wake sweetened raspberry cake to tempt just one lick and the barest hint of romantic rose petals and sandalwood. I simply love that each form of Aurelia amplifies another facet of this delicious scent potion. I plan to compose a more in-depth comparison review once I have all the products from dusting powder to bath salts next year.\n\nQueen's Gloves (Gathered Notes and Desciption: This scent was inspired by a recipe for an aromatic powder made to scent the leather gloves of Queen Elizabeth I. This powder was a gift from her secret lover, the Earle of Essex. Date of original recipe is about 1588. It was said she was seen often walking around sniffing the gloves while carrying them in her hand with a smile on her face. Notes include: Egyptian rose absolute, orris root, Benzoin, essence of citron, clove bud, lavender, rosewood, muscade (nutmeg) and Amyris.)\n\nThis is an ancient regal fragrance that defies conventional expectations of feminine and masculine as it strangely dances the line of both. I fully admit Queen's Glovesm initially caught me completely off guard with a leathery orange and clove opening, but in the months I have spent in its company, it has certainly grown on me and I can faintly detect the rose and lavender if I concentrate. It's one of those note mosaics that immediately harkens back to another era and at the same time allows you to understand another facet of a complex historical figure. Queen's Gloves is the blend to wear if you attend a faire or themed event dealing with the 16th century. THIS is the scent of Gloriana and a romance that could never be!\n\nLip Butters formula- This was my third time ordering the Lip Butters and as with Absinthe Marshmallow and Campfire Tales if I could only stop licking my lips and thinking about eating the sticks, I could fully concentrate and properly catalogue my thoughts. First and foremost the scents are phenomenal and taste like the real thing as promised on the label. For performance, they start out solid then once applied melt on the lips and I haven't had an annoying breakouts with this formula, which is fantastic. If I had to rate them overall, I would say they are the upper middle of better formulas I have tried. They nicely moisturize, but I don't think I would use them for the harsh winter months when I need a balm with moderate repairing properties. For me, they are more suited for light work if that makes sense and I will enjoy these Lip Butters spring and summer and early fall.\n\nRose Petal Jam lip butter\n\nAs it says on the tin, a soft delicious rose fragrance that tastes like taking a bite of a sugared rose petal with a tart jammy finish. I wish this came in a perfume option or body powder. I save this beauty for special occasions or when I'm reading special Tudor inspired fiction. It's romantic and delicious.\n\nGift with Purchase: Massage Bar (Made with cocoa, coconut and shea butter, bees wax, Lavender buds and organic Lavender essential oil) *Thank you, Moona!\n\nCan we just pause for a moment and admire the stunning artistry that goes into MoonaLisa's packaging and branding? I'm honestly blown away every time I open a newly themed collection and I look forward to the mystery of the artwork or fine details in the items tucked into each parcel. This massage bar is no exception as it came wrapped in a lovely historical-styled tableau and the bar was shaped as an adorable heart with \"nubs\" and real lavender buds peeking through. The scent is heavenly, creamy cocoa and lavender and that aroma carries over into the shower in addition to the beeswax. I would purchase a large chunk of this in a heartbeat, it worked wonders on my elbows and heels.\n\nConfetti Cake detangler (Scent Description: Big white fluffy cake, with mounds and mounds of freshly made buttercream icing, sprinkled with bright and cheery Confetti sprinkles.)\n\nSpeaking of surprises, Confetti Cake took well the cake, haha, when it came to the unexpected of these orders. I was anticipating the most exquisite vanilla cake with sugared vanilla icing and wouldn't you know it, it smells like banana cake. It was nice (especially the scrumptious vanilla part), a bit nostalgic and I used the entire bottle, but I don't think I would repurchase the detangler. Perhaps I would like Confetti Cake in a milk bath. Oh well, can't love everything and my pocketbook sighs in relief.\n\nBongo Poppy Cake detangler (Scent Description: Delicious, lemon poppy seed cake, drowned with an unhealthy dose of lightly spiced cream cheese icing dripping all over it!)\n\nNow my pocketbook can start panicking because Bongo Poppy Cake is coming home in EVERYTHING next year. Oh, this is amazing, at first it smells like sweet happy lemon fruity pebbles then as it warms up on my curls it resembles homemade lemon cake and I'm completely smitten with this comforting fragrance. The hype about Bongo Poppy Cake was warranted. It's the best lemon cake blend I have found in my years of collecting and I must get a perfume bottle of this. For longevity, I get a full day and a half of waltzing about smelling of delightful lemon cake with the smallest dollop of cream cheese. Just perfection!\n\nDusting Powder formula- I feel I'm reconnecting or channeling a lost portion of myself when I use dusting powders and if you want to feel fancy grab a canister and shake shake to be swept away or be reminded of a time of luxury and self pampering. I should have purchased dusting powder years ago as this is a marvellous experience that just leaves my skin silky soft and smelling like a delicate brush of whatever fragrance is listed on the generously sized can. For more personal reasons why I adore this formula, it doesn't cake no how much I use at one time, it keeps unwanted dampness away in the unforgiving heat and helps with annoying rubbing from undergarments. I want to savor these canisters for as long as possible so I only allow an indulgence every Sunday before a full week of night work. It's just an extra special treat to look forward to that only MoonaLisa can offer.\n\nLilac and Hyacinths dusting powder (Scent Description: Bloom open your day with this beautiful & fresh scent of Lilacs and Hyacinths)\n\nExactly as it says on the tin, it's like covering yourself in a lavish spread of lilac and hyacinth blooms! The scent is delicate in the dusting powder form so I must in theory purchase everything to layer with, right? I seriously need to go with my gut anymore when I'm in the heat of these hunger games type releases, I knew I was going to adore this and yet I only stopped at one canister of floral olfactory magic. Lesson learned. Mmmhm. A very hard lesson learned and shall not be need repeated.\n\nGift with Purchase: One Note Wonder Liquid Soap in Honeyed Strawberry & Rhubarb *thank you, Moona!\n\nI don't know how this Willy Wonka (or would it be Willivine or Wilhelmina?) of the Indie World does it, but everything she makes smells like a luxurious treat for yourself that you want to nibble on or tempt a lick of. Even soap! This is another gem I'm hiding away and only using on special occasions, it smells like sugared crushed strawberry juice and tart rhubarb straight from the garden. If I concentrate I want to say something floral is also mixed within this sunny fragrance. It almost reminds me of Ramo's Raspberry & Rose just with a sweet strawberry twist. Overall, a definite keeper and scent treasure to hoard away.\n\nMoonaLisa: A Supernatural Clean\n\nSixteen92 and Ajevie\n\nReady for their close-ups!\n\nLeave it to Sixteen92 to present a gorgeous reeling of atmospheric fragrances that makes me want to dress up in all my historical finery and pretend I'm in another era in entirely as I recite iconic lines in front my vanity table. The following are ramblings about a handful of scent potions from the Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 collections inspired by horror film/books and The Golden Age of Hollywood. These various vials and ampule have been patiently waiting for months and now they are ready for their close-ups!\n\nOne Note At A Time:\n\nRedrum (inspired by Stephen King's The Shining (1977)) (Description and Notes- The muffled din of a ghostly masquerade party - faint clink of champagne flutes, a ticking ebony clock, expensive furs, hazy hallways, and specters moving through shadow)\n\nOn opening there is a distinct mixture of something cloying and chemical-like almost akin to polished dark shellacked wood with mothballs (maybe even tire spray?) and yet fuzzy childhood memories of exploring forgotten closets are slowly resurfacing as I sit back. I can hear the sound of the closet door rustling and resisting to completely reveal its contained secrets against the grain of a thick arsenic-green carpet as Redrum takes me back, there's disturbed dust on plastic bags in the dim light and I can definitely detect the expensive furs and sweetness of alcohol from the champagne. It's eerie and unsettling as promised and yet a little like a personal homecoming for me as I can smell a familiar beautiful vintage perfume materializing just under the strong wood and chemical aromas. I never learned the names of the bottles that adorned my Baba's vanity table but I can clearly remember the label designs and the one I'm wanting to compare Redrum to had a gold label with a red border and was in a frosted glass tall slender bottle. If only that wood and cloying chemical combination would release me and let me enjoy a revisit to the fragrant ghosts of my childhood but alas it refuses to settle and I can get an unpleasant pinching headache with Redrum. I'm still keeping this vial for future costume ideas and a bit of personal nostalgia.\n\nDarkness Was Enough (inspired by Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot (1975)) (Notes- Ancient woods, beeswax candles, spiced honey, charred amber, saffron crocus)\n\n'Salem's Lot, the book and the movie respectively are iconic horror treats and how I wish to smell like a seductive vampire hiding deep in an abandoned house with Darkness Was Enough, but alas I smell I'm enjoying spiced tomato soup next to a guttering candle. Reading the notes this tomato soup fragrance doesn't make sense and I have been racking my brain trying to figure what this blend reminds of in my museum-sized perfume collection and it finally hit me the other morning- Pyromancy. Darkness Was Enough smells like Pyromancy only more acidic if that makes sense and has a melting candle note versus a hot metal with pepper under the tomato soup aroma. Since I already have Pyromancy in a larger size (somedays I just want to smell like a piping bowl of creepy soup!), I don't honestly know the future for Darkness Was Enough. I may put it some whipped soap or pass it along to a coworker who is still exploring Sixteen92's amazing scent artistry.\n\nBette (inspired by Ruth Elizabeth \"Bette\" Davis/Bette Davis, April 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989; some of her films include: What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, All About Eve, The Little Foxes and All This And Heaven Too)\n\n(Notes-Angel food cake, floral honey, marshmallow, pistachio, French vanilla, loose black tea)\n\nThe long wait was worth it when it comes to The Golden Age collection and, in particular, this fantastic marshmallow fragrance. Bette makes her entrance with promised realistic angel food cake (heavy on the sweet almond) and crumbled pistachio on top then divine french vanilla rolls in and completely elevates this perfume from delicious to très chic! The floral honey is a drizzling over the almond cake for those concerned and on me I swear I detect a drop of creamy sandalwood blended in with the Sixteen92's famous marshmallow. Bette lasts throughout a 13 hour shift and she's just marvellous!\n\nJean (inspired by Harlean Harlow Carpenter/Jean Harlow, March 3, 1911 – June 7, 1937; some her films include: Bombshell, China Seas, Hell's Angels and Saratoga)\n\n(Notes- White gardenia, Mexican tuberose, sparkling aldehydes, ginger ale, passion fruit, coconut water, silken musks)\n\nIf you are looking for a dreamy floral-fruit fragrance that harkens back to the glitz and sparkle of Old Hollywood, look no further than Jean. This is class, allure and a bit of playful sass. Right away I get the aldehydes I recognize from Habanera and Ligeia and they meld beautifully with the buttery gardenia and soft coconut. Sixteen92's gardenia is the reason I'm an avid hunter of that note now and I'm going to say it, no one else's compares- it never smells like soap or shampoo or stale hairspray, it's just a silken floral that adds elegance to any blend it touches. The tuberose adds a slight \"dirtiness\" to this perfume which is just aces and researching it looks like Jean may be also a homage to Jungle Gardenia which was favoured by the elite of Old Hollywood. The passion fruit becomes more apparent on me after a few hours along with a vintage quality that stays until the final notes fade. I received multiple compliments on this perfume and I adore Jean and must have a full bottle next year (I missed the spring collection waiting for my samples to arrive then rest). Thank you to all who recommended this beauty!\n\nMarlene (inspired by Marie Magdalene \"Marlene\" Dietrich/Marlene Dietrich, 27 December 1901 – 6 May 1992; some of her films include: The Scarlet Empress, Witness for the Prosecution, Around the World in 80 Days and Knight Without Armour)\n\n(Notes- Alba rose, copal, bearded iris, scarlet lips, flushed cheeks, davana, plum syrup, gin fizz, smoke)\n\nI think we can all agree, scent is a suggestive and a personal experience so I hope you will forgive me for getting a bit weepy with Marlene because after a long decade I have been reunited with the exact vintage fragrance of red lipstick my Baba used to don. She wore violets like a timeless queen and I can pick out a creamy powdery floral under the lipstick on me that smells indeed of violets and there is no cough syrup to report (which can occur when violets meet my finicky skin chemistry); what wonderful magic is this?! I don't get any rose or plum for those curious and there is perhaps a wisp of separate smoke in the background, but then again I always thought real vintage lipstick had a smokiness to it. I also can just make out the smallest drop of sweet gin hiding in the long dry down. When I sit down and go through previous offerings with similar notes, Bruise Violet and Mina Harker could be called louder sister scents of Marlene and even Mein Herr Marquis could be a sister blend. I was curious if Marlene would smell like Winifred with the plum and davana, but there is no scent comparison after all these weeks. I love how soft and pretty this perfume is on me. My only lament is I wish Marlene stayed on my skin longer as it fades within two hours on me. I may need to look into a EdP option next year, this is so lovely but fleeting.\n\nLouise (inspired by Mary Louise Brooks/Louise Brooks, November 14, 1906 – August 8, 1985; some of her films include: Pandora's Box, Love 'Em and Leave 'Em, The American Venus and God's Gift to Women)\n\n(Notes- Sultry amber, red ink, black kohl, night blooms, Tonkin musk (synthetic), wormwood, soft suede, glistening strands of pearls)\n\nSo Louise is fascinating as it opens similar to Bridget Bishop with the \"night blooms\" being cold and a bit resinous then this slinky smokey ink and soft suede medley peeks out and turns aquatic and silky. The wormwood smells like cool absinthe droplets and I've stuck my nose into enough antique jewellery cupboards to recognize the scent of old silk strands and saltiness of worn pearls that is evident in Louise on the long dry down. Louise is impressive and I'm over the moon the suede hasn't turned into a leathery chemical-bomb on me (I seem to amplify the wormwood (almost like anise/licorice), a dirty iris and silky/aquatic seductive element of this perfume). I think I finally found a suede blend from Sixteen92 I can wear on my skin versus only in my hair in small measured applications *claps*. This is another bottle I must have when the times comes, in the meantime I can't stop dabbing on this little number and dancing like no one is watching and vamping in the mirror in black lacy garters. What can I say, this Mrs. Grundy is ready to transform into a Sheba!\n\nSixteen92\n\n*reviews composed in April 2020\n\nSpring is slowly returning and these are the blends that have helped me battle the end of winter blues, Valentine-blahs that hit every year and have been gentle and intriguing distractions. From timeless florals that smell fresh from the rained-over garden, comforting intoxicating honeyed fruit and dark forest greenery plus everything unexpected, this was the perfect way to herald in spring, new beginnings and an attitude about different subjects (and notes).\n\n*A special thank you to Forest and Josh from Nui Cobalt Designs for sending me these fragrances.\n\n-The following perfumes lasted from 2 (Coimetrophilia) to 13 hours (The Bees' High Tea and Ailurophilia) on my skin and even longer in my hair and upper neck.\n\nPurchased Bottles:\n\nThe Bee's Knees (A lively blend to brighten the mood and lift your spirits. Leaves of lemon balm and crushed coriander seeds accompany lavender scones with spring harvest honey and a scant drop of green cognac. Wear this scent to chase away the doldrums and banish the blues.)(-bottle purchased last year-)\n\nSimply put The Bee's Knees is one of the most realistic honey and old english lavender oils I have found in the indie realm. On me, this blend is sun-warmed dark golden honey drizzled over sugar-dusted lavender scones, I don't get any cognac or additional herbs and if they are there, they are blended in so seamlessly and expertly. It's magnificent and is a crowning jewel of my vast collection. Every time I wear it I imagine an English garden scene in late spring into summer and The Bee's Knees instantly brightens my mood as described. It was love at first sniff and what can I say, I fell hard.\n\nThe Bees' Cotillion (So fancy! This ebullient blend evokes mirth and merriment to highlight your most endearing qualities. Succulent pears simmering in spring honey with the gentlest breeze of lily carried in a homespun infusion of honeysuckle flowers.)(-purchased this year after becoming entranced by the vial last year-)\n\nThe Bees' Cotillion is an intoxicating blend of fruit, warm honey (I can't get enough of Nui Cobalt's honey fragrances; I want to hoard them all like a shimmery amber dragon) and florals. It has found a special place on top my vanity, is one of my favourite pear perfumes to date and I know this sounds odd but this scent is lucky as good things seem to happen when I don it. It's professional and positively unique and says I have arrived in life while also staying approachable.\n\nAnthophilia ~The love of Flowers. (White tea rose, French lavender, cotton flower, Easter lily, pear blossom, the barest hint of ylang, and the vivid green of snipped stems. Wear this scent to attract beauty, pleasure, and luxury.) Fragrance currently listed on the site (-purchased vial and shortly after full bottle-)\n\nI can't help but hold my head high and breathe deep with this lovely blend as it evokes a treasured era of study for myself and taps into happy childhood memories of Easter celebrations and events. On opening, it's a bouquet of florals and sweet pear anchoring the medley keeping it from being considered heady and this beautiful balance and waltz of spring florals stay true throughout the night without veering into soap nor hairspray/chemical; Anthophilia is a nosegay of refinement and feminity. If you love or are searching for the nectar you get from a bouquet of roses and lilies with an unexpected sweet airiness of pear (and a drop of vanilla- ylang ylang), definitely give Anthophilia a wave of the wrist. It's simply magnificent! Brava, Nui Cobalt Designs!\n\nPurchased vials and press samples:\n\nCoimetrophilia ~The love of Cemeteries. Freshly turned soil, gentle rain, moss-covered tombstones, low-lying fog, old red oaks, and fading funeral lilies. Wear this somber scent to invoke the blessings of your ancestors and commune with the dearly departed.) (-purchased vial-)\n\nI had to purchase this vial as it called out to my fascination with places of sacred rest of the departed and I wasn't disappointed. On application, I get this ultra-realistic wet spring grass aroma that slowly shifts over to cold wet stone, a hint of decaying white lily and finally dries down to comforting moss and dirt. Coimetrophilia captures my memories of wandering in the local cemetery as a child in spring tentatively touching the stormed-over worn stones and deciphering names and dates covered by emerald moss. For longevity, Coimetrophilia fades within a few hours. It also stayed relatively close to my skin which I appreciated as I could bring a little unique though respectful macabre into the work setting and not disturb anyone and be left to my fond memories of exploration and the stories I have gathered about those gone but not forgotten.\n\nStinger\n\n\"Even bees, the little almsmen of spring bowers, know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.\" - John Keats\n\n(A refreshing potion to cleanse, heal, and protect. Blackberry brambles, honeyed black tea, and crushed coriander with ginger root, lemon myrtle, fresh basil, and fig. Wear to banish negativity and cast a radiant shield to repel all malefaction.)\n\nNui Cobalt is one of the only shops that creates tea blends my finicky chemistry will play nice with and Stinger is a star example. It's intoxicating lush fruit, lemony aromatic herbs and dark seductive tea. For those that grew up in the country, welcome back to memories of berry picking deep in the jaggers; just watch out for those pesky yellow jackets or white-faced hornets! Mmmph. Negative everything, be gone!\n\nAilurophilia ~The love of Cats. (Egyptian musk, tonka, and dulce de leche wrapped in luxuriant cashmere, soft suede, wisps of sandalwood and copal smoke. Wear this comforting concoction to honor your feline familiars and invoke their ancient power.) (-purchased vial-)\n\nWith Ailurophilia I get a glow or aura of allure, pampered luxury and Old Hollywood Royalty at its finest. Perhaps I can finally detect and identify musk because this is sublime and it lasts 12+ hours on my skin, amplifying with every hour as the first sweet comforting dulce de leche notes fade. Like a feline, Ailurophilia has so many facets to its character; it's overall mysterious, fascinating and a bit naughty. If you are looking for a mental image, I immediately think of Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra winking as she makes her grand entrance to Rome.\n\nHome Sweet Hive\n\nBees do have a smell, you know, and if they don't they should, for their feet are dusted with spices from a million flowers.” - Ray Bradbury\n\n(A comforting blend for calm contentment. Bulgarian lavender, oatstraw, honey-roasted chestnuts, maple sugar and a scant pinch of lemon zest. Wear for grounding, centering, and to carry sacred space wherever you go.)\n\nWith the whole world going mad, this is one perfume I could bathe in as I get a tussy mussey of relaxing lavender and oatstraw that just invites warm comforting thoughts of home and sanctuary. The savoury roasted chestnuts come out more as this oil is aging and it melds sublimely with the sweet maple sugar. Home Sweet Hive is a delightful blending of spring and fall and I could see myself wearing this perfume in early spring and then again in fall and winter.\n\nHigher Mind (Smart is sexy. An assertive and herbaceous scent composed of green tea, sage, three sacred sandalwoods, rosemary, chilled citrus, and tonka. Wear this enchanted fragrance to hone perception, wit, and focus.)(-arrived with purchased order-)\n\nRosemary! Finally, I am reunited with the unmistakable scent of fresh crushed rosemary and all things green and enchanting. I could happily huff this oil all day and I have noticed Higher Mind clears the cobwebs and helps me \"put my thinking cap on\" as my Baba always said. The drydown is unexpectedly alluring leaning slightly masculine. Another keeper and I believe I'm going to wear this perfume when I'm studying different subjects I missed so long ago.\n\nThe Bees' High Tea (An uplifting blend to forge lasting connections and cultivate friendships. Delicate vanilla cakes with rose petal preserves, elderflower wine, and Earl Grey tea with a dainty drop of spring harvest honey.) (-purchased vial-)\n\n*Cue the violins and donning the white lace gloves* I finally have my little claws on The Bees' High Tea and it's everything everyone was saying it was. This is STUNNING! For those that fell hard for LOVE, you must try The Bees' High Tea because they are undeniably (surprise) sister scents. I recognize the vintage powdery rose and vanilla from LOVE right out of the gate and the addition of a drop of honey and earl grey elevates this blend from Oooo to Mmmphf! It's been a week since I received this vial and the vanilla cake is deepening with hint of butter on the long drydown (as well as the rose jam) and the tea is there staying true and not turning soapy. The elderberry wine (smells like rich less sweet grapes with a trace of tartness) is the note that amps on me the most and I'm learning all about a new note that obviously loves my chemistry. Overall a sweet elegant and yet almost playful perfume.\n\nCobalt Druid: Sultry (A time-honored Hoodoo blend, famous for its power to attract passionate love as well as abundant wealth. Two dark, lascivious vanillas swirled with dragon's blood, heavy velvet musk and the secrets of an old rootworker's conjure cabinet.)\n\nNow this one is intriguing. I get heavy sweet dragon's blood, the impression of a black velvet dress slashed with red and a smearing of peanut butter? My chemistry has this tendency to morph patchouli to either rusted metal or peanut butter so I'm curious if there is unlisted patchouli in Sultry or my tired brain is playing tricks. Curiously, the peanut butter scent is fleeting as the dragon's blood amplifies on me and the vanilla with velvet takes over creating one seductive little number. Where is a black-masked mascarade ball when you need one?\n\nBusy Bee (A piquant potion for swift and efficient productivity. A blend of Oolong and Tibetan black tea with peach blossom honey, cardamom, and clove, sharpened with pink peppercorn and dry oakwood. Wear this scent for improved focus, diligence, and motivation.)\n\nThe above should be hell on earth on my skin with the peach and tea (2 of my top death notes), but I'm enthralled that Busy Bee is an absolute treasure that smells delicious but dark and a little mysterious on me; perfect for the rainy weather and keeping my full attention. I finally have a true smelling peach tea perfume to show off and to recommend.\n\nCeraunophilia ~The love of Thunder and Lightning (Slivered almond and ozone swirled with white clove, ambergris accord, ponderous grey musk, spiced tobacco, and black cotton. Wear this galvanic scent to call forth your inner strength and summon your fortitude.)(-purchased vial-)\n\nBoy, I'm learning such nifty names with this clever new Valentine collection and with Ceraunophilia I can't decide what keeps bringing me back for another closed-eyed huff, the salty ambergris, the almond or the dark swirling clove. This blend has left an impression on my scent memory and is a unique conceptual take on one of my favourite things in nature to watch and experience (the elements are there creating a perfect storm in my mind). It would be ideal for the bath and I can only hope it is turned into a potent bath spell someday.⚡☔\n\nBees on the Bayou\n\n\"Every saint has a bee in his halo.\" - Elbert Hubbard\n\n(A dark, seductive blend for a sultry southern evening. Vines heavy with honeysuckle entwined with Easter lily, linden blossom, and neroli over a sweet foundation of pipe tobacco, pralines, and creamed honey. Wear to inspire lust and longing in the objects of your desire.)\n\nNui Cobalt Designs has this amazing way with timeless florals and here the honeysuckle is sweet and rich while the neroli adds a fragrant tartness to the underlining notes. This is one lovely blend and I love how the honey pralines appear right as the florals fade. Speaking of the flowers I'm still learning unfamiliar notes, but I swear I detect the lemony-hearted magnolia making a cameo appearance at one point or other with Bees on the Bayou. I think I'll wear this oil more in the summer months and alternate this perfume with Feu Follet as those remind me so much of a family friend who was a southern belle.\n\nQueen Bee (An opulent blend to evoke confidence, poise, and effortless grace. Creamy white gardenia and fluffy whipped honey.)\n\nI was hoping for a summer version of Sixteen92's Ligeia, but instead have been united with sweet innocent nostalgia as this oil smells like a new baby doll in the warm sunlight on me and buttery gardenia. I didn't think I would find this familiar aroma until I finally got around to Rose Mallow or Violet Mallow from Solstice Scents but here it is taking me back and bringing a new white floral fragrance to reach for this summer. The heady floral powderiness of Queen Bee lasts quite a while as well, fading away completely at 10 hours. Another keeper!\n\nWasp (An austere balsamic blend for when you need to clean up and get organized. Fresh linen, crisp chardonnay, and a rain-quenched herb garden edged with impeccable boxwood topiaries.)\n\nJust as described as the fresh linen scent rises up first to hit my nose, but this isn't the cheap headache-inducing kind, oh no, this is expensive fancy laundry detergent presented. The chardonnay is the next scent to slowly glide in and with that Wasp turns into a scene of laundry flapping in the warm spring sunshine while classical music plays from an open window. The final aroma that is noticed is something resembling calming rosemary. I like this oil and I guess this means I'm growing as a perfume collector as I can appreciate Wasp even with the expensive soap element front and centre.\n\nBlack Honey\n\n“To be successful, one has to be one of three bees - the queen bee, the hardest working bee, or the bee that does not fit in.” - Suzy Kassem\n\n(An offbeat Gothic blend for true renegades and revolutionaries. Autumn harvest honey, nutmeg, clove, roasted cocoa, molasses, birch bark, star anise, and oud. Wear when you're ready to shake things up and ditch the comfort zone.)\n\nNot at all what I was expecting as I get spiced tootsie roll pops candy in the vial and on my skin I get root beer barrel candies (I guess I amp birch). The long drydown a glimmer of honey and vanilla comes forward, and then the root beer returns. Well, that is all different and I'm sure this would be someone's perfect cup of tea...actually I do know someone who would love this for pure nostalgia reasons. As for me- Oh well, can't love everything.\n\n(**please remember everyone's skin chemistry is different and what my chemistry does with one note (or series of notes) may not happen on someone else. That's the unique beauty of perfume oils, they react with everyone differently- don't hesitate to try a sample of something if it interests you).\n\nSelenophilia ~The Love of the Moon (Night-blooming jasmine, dewy gardenia, Mysore sandalwood, white amber, pearlescent musk, silver sage and a touch of frozen clove. Wear this luminous blend to invoke the magic of the Moon and draw down her healing energy.) (-purchased vial-)\n\nMore and more I'm finding new facets of Selenophilia to be awed by as this oil has in store something new every hour it seems. It morphs and changes like the moon itself throughout the month and year starting out bright, buttery and luminous bringing to mind a full moon and then it darkens with the clove and almost something smokey which turns over completely to soft and classic (for me the drydown is my favourite). This is a lovely heady white floral perfume to reach for when you need something with a little oomph and glamour.\n\nBee In Your Bonnet\n\n\"Books are the bees which carry the quickening pollen from one to another mind.\" - James Russell Lowell\n\n(A piquant blend to enliven the mind and stir the senses. Raw rhubarb and cardamom with toasted oats, Madagascar vanilla, ginger ale, and caramelized honey. Wear for support in any intellectual effort to stay sharp and alleviate brain fog.)\n\nHere is another fragrant medley to wake the senses and clear the cobwebs. For those seeking the tart juiciness of rhubarb, here's Bee In Your Bonnet! On me, I get the rhubarb and slight bubbliness of the ginger ale after about 20 minutes on the long drydown the vanilla and toasted oats with honey slowly become more apparent. This one is a like not love, but a keeper overall.\n\nDendrophilia ~The love of Trees. (Moss-covered deadfall, birchwood and pine, lingering resins and sunlight through the leaves, a trace of woodsmoke, the memory of vetiver and cedar. Wear this evocative blend to commune with the spirits of nature and reconnect with your primal wisdom.)(-arrived with purchased order-)\n\nMy dream Moss Maiden perfume is that you? Oh, I feel like some fantastic warrior queen of the ancient forests painted in blue woad or a nimble-footed dryad of myth with Dendrophilia and I'm going to say it, one of the best realistic spring forest fragrances I have encountered in the indie realm. On me, the hyper-realistic moss and deadfall amplify (along with a hint of woodsmoke and dried pine needles) and sweep me away to dream locales and treasured stories. This is joining Sixteen92's masterpiece, Lycanthrope for instant relaxation and meditative/sleep oils.\n\nThe Birds and the Bees (A very sexy fragrance of dark amber resin, Moroccan musk, ruby red and bright white grapefruits, a spike of black clove and a swirl of summer honey. Wear this sensual perfume to inspire passion and kindle romance.)(-purchased vial-)\n\nI'm finding my skin chemistry battles grapefruit and then drains any beauty from it turning it into chalky bubblegum (this is the 4th blend this has happened with from different shops). Ah, but in my hair is a whole different story as I get the mystique and seductive quality from The Birds and the Bees. Just perhaps I'm finally learning to identify musks because I can detect something \"different\" swirling in the winds. Something resembling fine plush fabric is also present or that could be my imagination. Into unscented whipped soap, The Birds and the Bees goes to turn some heads this upcoming spring and summer. For longevity, this one is fleeting, but nice while it lasts.\n\nDanu (Where the sea meets the sky, where the stormwaters return along the sun's rays, the loving kindness of the Universal Mother in her Celtic aspect. A luminous moon-white floral meets an iridescent aquatic. Three tender lotuses, Tahitian monoi, slender bamboo stalks, tuberose, and a soothing cup of tea.)\n\nPoetry in the description and poetry in the vial as I get salty tuberose that brings to mind a lone blossom bobbing in the incoming waves. On my skin, more of the clean aspect of the notes amplifies and Danu smells like fresh salty expensive soap. It's certainly elegant and lovely, however, I need to remember this one can reach across a room if I put too much oil on. One tiny dab behind each ear is enough to take me away to unchartered locales and lyrical artistry.\n\nSwarm\n\n\"Aerodynamically the bumble bee shouldn’t be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn’t know it, so it goes on flying anyway.\" - Mary Kay Ash\n\n(This delightful blend inspires hope, attracts allies, and nourishes friendship. A honey-drizzled blueberry tart bejewelled with candied apricot in a toasted almond crust. Wear for connection, collaboration, and encouragement.)\n\nMmm, this is really perfume? I could honestly drink this and I can't stop making embarrassing noises once Swarm is placed on my skin. Okay time to focus, I get Nui Cobalt's sublime realistic smelling blueberry accord and the textbook perfect toasted almond crust I recognize from Poppycock and yes even candied apricot. The honey is very delicate and slowly warms up along with the almond crust as the spectacular blueberry fades. With the craziness at work, I'm going to be donning this gem and secretly huffing my wrists and braid when no one is looking but then again, let them look and take a sniff of Swarm and behold something from a gourmand's dream.\n\nShe Stopped To Pet A Bumblebee\n\n\"Last night as I was sleeping, I dreamt --\n\nO, marvelous error --\n\nThat there was a beehive here inside my heart\n\nAnd the golden bees were making white combs\n\nAnd sweet honey from all my failures.\" - Antonio Machado\n\n(An ode to the living spirit of compassion. Cocoa butter and shea, cotton flower, silk tree, apple blossom, wildflower honey, bee balm, and heliotrope. Wear this scent to conjure an atmosphere of loving kindness and receptivity.)\n\nWith this collection, I can't get over the adorable clever names and She Stopped To Pet A Bumblebee is such a gentle delightful scent creation that smells like cocoa butter, lemony bee balm (must also applaud the use of this heavenly underappreciated note) apple and the barest hint of honey. It almost reminds me of Pixie with the realistic apple blossom, however, She Stopped To Pet A Bumblebee goes in a more slightly airy and fresh scented direction versus graham cracker and spring grass. I don't know about this scent potion creating loving kindness, but I do know this one calms me down in chaotic stress-filled spaces (like the packed supermarket) and I have been reaching for the vial especially this whole week for different reasons. Now the opening and initial hour after application are nice and pleasant, but I can't recommend the drydown on this one enough- it's a hint of remaining apple and lemon under creamy white chocolate and a kiss of honey. So pretty and hits the cravings, comfort factor and nostalgia elements perfectly.\n\nNui Cobalt Designs\n\nAs I have aged the holiday season has become cold and mournful (everyone you care for leaves and you are left staring at empty chairs and alone with shadows of regrets), however there are memories of once happy times that keep some spark of cheer glowing for myself in November through January and MoonaLisa: A Supernatural Clean somehow taps into those secret recollections with their realistic smelling gourmands, touches of vintage delight and whimsy and overall presentation that whisks all me away to a better place and time and I can't recommend this enchanting shop enough for someone that needs a smile or a unexpected reminder of comfort and joy not just in the winter months but throughout the year.\n\nWinter Spray-In Hair Tangler formula- I'll open this rambling long overdue review with first commenting on MoonaLisa's Hair Detangler formula which is a true holy grail for myself and something my vanity table will never be seen without. It's not only a compulsion anymore but an absolute necessity to stock up with as many bottles of these hair-loving elixirs as I can afford every release and then hoard them away to treat myself to a unique blend every morning and night. With my (past) waist length mane, I run through a generous sized bottle about every month and half and I truly receive my full money's worth with these products (I can't stop touching my soft manageable hair now). The longevity on the fragrance varies between each blend, however, I have discovered citrus and spice based bottles can last days in my hair. I know I keep saying this every post when it comes to MoonaLisa, but it's the truth: where has this product been all my life!?\n\nIced Gingerbread (Gathered Notes and Description: Realistic Gingerbread blend with mild nostalgic Yuletide spice and white icing)\n\nAs it says on the tin and this is my holy grail gingerbread fragrance home at last to spray and lavish my locks anytime I wish. To touch briefly on the scent composition (I still have the perfume and argan hair oil versions to gush about shortly) this is a rich spicy cookie scent with white chocolate icing very reminiscent of the old fashioned animal crackers we are all still looking for when we pass the cookie aisle or visit little mom & pop stores. When it comes to longevity I can enjoy about 3 days of spice, vanilla and happy thoughts with Iced Gingerbread in the detangler and I have found it pairs fabulously with different floral perfumes I happen to dab in my curls; lilac with Iced Gingerbread is my current favourite and fingers crossed a certain scent artist reads this and creates this magical marriage next year.\n\nChristmas Cocoa (Gathered Notes and Description: What warms your heart and hearth more than a steaming cup of Christmas Cocoa. Hot cocoa with an espresso shot, topped with gobs of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon, chili and nutmeg, with a hint of sweet smoldering yule fire in the distance.)\n\nThis is Moona's signature chocolate accord shot through with espresso and a glorious sky-high mound of realistic whipped cream with a dusting of spice and wisp of smoke. It was also one of the first bottles from this haul I was tempted to take a little taste of. The listed smoke is becoming more noticeable as this bottle is aging and I wore this detangler (along with my S'mores & Hot Cocoa perfume also by MoonaLisa) to a regional cake festival this past January and I had a few people leaning (uncomfortably) close and saying something smelled delicious while in a long line to get to the festival, so I guess those two fragrances are winners! For similar blends to look out for during the year, those that have had the pleasure to try Cauldron Cakes in the fall, you would love Christmas Cocoa.\n\nSnuggler (Gathered Notes and Description: The drink of choice while wintering in North Beach, San Francisco! Rich dark hot cocoa and peppermint schnapps.)\n\nAnother fragrance I fell hard for last winter and had to indulge in a special treat for myself in 2019. The mysteries of skin chemistry still amaze me and hold so many surprises in store it seems because however how decadent and unexpectedly akin to dark chocolate cake Snuggler smells in the perfume verison, the peppermint schnapps amplifies in my hair with the detangler form and I do have to watch in case I'm taken for a holiday lush when first applied, haha oops. That punch of peppermint booze calms down though but I still enjoy this fragrance at home and may just spoil myself further next year and get a dusting powder to cover myself in. The longevity of Snuggler in the detangler is also impressive going on for nearly 2 days.\n\nBlood Orange & Chocolate (Gathered Notes and Description: Just like the traditional Yuletide candy treat! Made with only real Orange essential oil, as are ALL of our citrus oils are ALWAYS all natural! And rich, dark Chocolate fragrance and Cocoa Absolute)\n\nSitting back I guess I collected quite a few chocolate blends with this haul and was craving something particular. Saying that, I'm sad to admit, Blood Orange & Chocolate wasn't exactly for me and I will stick with Whole for my dream winter orange aroma next year; this one although extremely realistic to chocolate covered oranges just didn't work in my hair as a fragrance. I bet Blood Orange & Chocolate would be divine in a soap or bath milk and I will try that form eventually as the orange is tart and sweet smelling while the cocoa absolute grounds it. I still used the entire bottle of this detangler and highly recommend it if you love the scent of chocolate covered fruit. Longevity and throw was mixed for this blend, certain times it would go for 2 days that I could still smell the citrus and others I couldn't smell it on my braid late that night. Ah well, that happens, can't fall for everything (and my pocketbook sighs in relief).\n\nNoona's Christmas Cookies (Gathered Notes and Description: A tribute to KC’s (Mooman) Sicilian Great-Grandmother. Made just like KC’s Nonna would make her special cookies ever year! A little of this, and a little of that)\n\nWell here's another bottle I was tempted to drink as Noona's Christmas Cookies is fresh oatmeal cookies from the oven drizzled in white chocolate, a hint of warm spice in the bottle and then has a bewitching realistic milky creaminess that amplifies in my hair. Mmm absolutely magnificent and I had to put a note on this bottle to use all others before even touching this scent confection again...and the bottle is nearly empty in June. I plan to hoard up on this scent come Yule 2020 in everything I can afford. For longevity this delicious smelling gem goes on for a day so I will definitely be layering it with the perfume, lotion, dusting powder and argan oil this coming winter to get the maxium scrumptious effect. I want to smell like a walking cookie!\n\nArgan Oil Hair Rescue formula- I can't have or recommend the detangler without mentioning the argan oil formula MoonaLisa offers because they are a match made in hair heaven and these products have worked absolute magic on my tresses. I have never had such shiny healthy looking hair. The Argan Oil I use after I have brushed out my mane with the aid of the Detangler then I add a dime size amount of argan oil in different scents to the end of my hair. If I have any excess oil on my hands I flip my hair down and place the excess in the back of my head. I run thru a bottle about every 3 months and they are worth every penny.\n\nIced Gingerbread (Gathered Notes and Desciption: Realistic Gingerbread blend with mild nostalgic Yuletide spice and white icing)\n\nIf anything the spices amplify a tiny bit more in the argan oil form which is perfectly okay with me as I can't stop talking about and stop waltzing about with this halo of irresistible gingerbread and white icing complete with vanilla extract and butter. I must hoard more next year and never run out.\n\nMilk Bath in Snuggler (Gathered Notes and Description: The drink of choice while wintering in North Beach, San Francisco! Rich dark hot cocoa and peppermint schnapps.)\n\nThis was my first Milk Bath purchase and certainly not my last as the formula is gentle and moisturzing plus fragrant with a boozy peppermint patty scent I could just float in. I have also tested this item on my tresses and it works wonderfully as a mild shampoo in a pinch as well as a shaving lather and of course as a bubble bath formula (it makes a nice blanket of minty bubbles with the smallest drops added to running water). The milk bath itself is a pearlescent white when poured and the scent lasts as long as it takes to get out of my water filled sanctuary. I can immediately put on any perfume I choose and the aromas do not clash. I need this in The Rumpkin!, Kitchen Witch, Lilacs & Hyacinths (review coming soon) and my beloved Aurelia. Uh oh, this is the start of another fragrant collection, hehe.\n\n*Must mention the adorable pop-up ornament of a gingerbread house that was tucked in my order (this shop makes you feel so special with every package). I displayed it in my office at work, thank you so much Moona!\n\nSnow Ice (Gathered Notes and Description: Fond memories Moona has when a child at camp during the Nevada snows, making natural \"ice cream\" from ice cold snow, condensed milk, Sugar and Vanilla extract. This scent is reminiscent of that: sweet crystallized vanilla sugar and cream)\n\nMmm! What can I say this is another holy grail perfume for me as this is most delectable vanilla I have encountered in the indie realm [claps]. Snow Ice is sublime, a true masterpiece as it's dreamy and gourmand but never childish or cloying and anyone could wear this as it isn't heavy and perfect for the workplace setting. I call this \"lace ice cream\" because it's so pretty, finishes off any look and yet so delicous smelling. I know this is a winter scent but I happily wear this oil all year round, very happy I purchased a full bottle.\n\nIced Gingerbread (Gathered Notes and Desciption: Realistic Gingerbread blend with mild nostalgic Yuletide spice and white icing)\n\nThe search is over, THIS is the gingerbread perfume of my dreams I have been searching for ever since I stepped foot into the indie perfume realm. We have here the ideal gingerbread scent sealed in a bottle along with a whiff of iced animal crackers I fondly remember and even a trace of butter and old-fashioned vanilla extract that appears after 6 hours. It's warm, comforting, incredibly realistic AND it stays on my skin more than 10 minutes (I finally have a gingerbread scent confection I can wear everywhere). I'm so happy and can't stop dancing!\n\nSurprise Extra Gifts (thank you, MoonaLisa: A Supernatural Clean)\n\nThe Gloaming perfume oil (Birch, silver fir, spruce, Cypress, peppermint, frankincense, cinnamon bark)\n\n*a sample that appeared in my one yule order/ there were 2 and I combined them for this review.\n\nThis shop is renowned for their gourmand scents but they also do realistic resins and earthy fragrances magnificently as well and The Gloaming is a perfect example. When applied it's like being directly underneath a pine tree with the needles and dirt, it's extremely relaxing and has a meditative quality I can lose myself in. I swear I smell unlisted patchouli as I'm receiving that familiar \"peanut butter and metal mix\" my skin chemistry morphs patchouli into with different blends and I'm in love. The refreshing peppermint appears hours later and I have been using The Gloaming to escape the June heat as I fall asleep. I hope this fragrance appears this coming winter because I would love a detangler and bath milk or bath salt pot in The Gloaming. I think Krampus Night! has some competition.\n\nSimmering Potpourri in Yuletide Cheer (Listed as \"an all natural blend of All-spice, Grapefruit peels, Cinnamon Star Anice, Nutmeg, Ginger Root, Hibiscus, Sea Salt & Essential Oils\")\n\nIn the bag, it's sweet fruit with seasonal spices that smell like Wassail or Glogg without the alcohol and I don't know about anyone else but this and the sparkle spray that appeared in the Halloween boxes need to be permanent items with each release. When in the heated pot the fragrance is intoxicating and my house is filled with the heavenly scent of spice and fruit. Bulldog funk is no match for Yuletide Cheer as it transforms everything and brightens moods to all that smell it when they visit. I hope this returns next winter. What a creative extra something special to finish this amazing haul.\n\nMoonaLisa: A Supernatural Clean\n\n□All is calm, all is bright with these enchanting blends by Nui Cobalt Designs❄️\n\n*review composed in January 2020\n\n2019 belonged to Nui Cobalt Designs and one other shop in my book and my collection just continues to expand with every release as I discover a new note I never thought I would love and another blue beauty of a bottle to bring home to display on my vanity. Here were the blends that arrived and brought in the new year with only good things to come for 2020. Merry Christmas to all celebrating today!\n\n*A special thank you to Forest and Josh from Nui Cobalt Designs for sending me these oils.\n\nThe following oils last between 5 to 12+ hours on my skin and even longer in my hair.\n\nPurchased on Black Friday:\n\nLove (Intimacy in a bottle. A blend to enhance your natural magnetism and power to forge passionate connections. The softest sugared rose dances with resplendent vanilla in flickering candlelight.)\n\nSomedays you just need to smell elegant and from a painting or stained glass window and that's exactly what I receive and feel like when I dab on Love. This is a gorgeous blend with a polished vintage rose, downy powder and realistic sweet singed creamy beeswax candle wax hiding in the background. It's soft and suggestive, speaking from a forgotten era of beauty and gentility.\n\nStarlight & Spider Silk (Swift and skillful, her instinct's artistry glimmers with deadly precision. This beguiling blend empowers you to ensnare the objects of your desire and attract every manner of earthly delight. Slender strands of cotton flower hung with trembling dewdrops, cold crystalline musk, and tiny black vanilla beans.)\n\nI don't know how Forest did it but this is the scent of clear gossamer swaying in the breeze and morning dewdrops with elegant vanilla. On me, there is something nearly floral and creamy about Starlight & Spider Silk (don't you love all of these poetic and perfectly matched names?). I don't have anything to compare this oil to currently in my vast collection. Wow, this is stunning and I can't help but think of waltzing spirits and one song in particular (Once Upon a December) when I have Starlight & Spider Silk dabbed all over. I can expect 12 hours of sophisticated perfection with this perfume and couldn't have asked for more.\n\nFairy Lights (A whimsical blend to invoke joy and the true spirit of the season. Their glow is the quintessence of Yuletide. Bright white copal softens into golden cathedral incense and wild honeycomb, then nestles into a deep dark vanilla and luxuriant amber.)\n\nFor the colder days and months to soon arrive, I wanted to seek out something that reminded me of happier memories of the holiday season and Fairy Lights became THE scent of 2019 I was determined to have. Although well blended, it's not quite what I was searching for, however, I'm falling for this fragrance slowly for the soft elegance that radiants from this oil that indeed reminds me of the appearance of Victorian Fairy Light. It's smooth and comforting with a hidden mint note that I'm guessing is the copal (or possible unlisted Palo santo) melding with my chemistry and with patient aging the warm honey note is coming more forward after the 4-hour mark then lasting until the end of my 12-hour shift. Another blend I can't say I have anything in my collection to compare to and with that Fairy Lights is a keeper, but my search continues for a realistic cathedral incense, sweet honey and beeswax perfume to call my mine and smells like my childhood Christmas Eve.\n\nWarm Fuzzies (The scent of softness and tender affection. Ripened peaches, cotton flower, flax, leaves of lamb's ear, smooth sandalwood, skin-warmed wool, a touch of Ceylon cinnamon and a sprinkle of ginger. Wear this comforting blend to encourage gentle kisses, wistful smiles, and acts of loving kindness.) *sample vial appeared in my Black Friday order.\n\nWhen I first opened Warm Fuzzies it brought to mind Wicked Pumpkin just without the pumpkin and maple as the peach immediately attached to my skin and amplified and I'm not going to lie, I was concerned as peach can turn into an ode to a tomcat, on me. Thankfully that hasn't happened and Warm Fuzzies is a soft peach that stays a dewy peach and smells also of clean sheets and a fresh grating of ginger. It has been accompanying me to work as the scent stays close and brings to mind warm spring sunlight.\n\nPress Samples:\n\nThe Star (The light of hope and the power of renewal. Winter citrus, chilled champagne, neroli, dogwood, angelica, frankincense, clover honey, porcelain musk, and snow-covered sandalwood. This sacred scent invokes Grace and fulfillment in all areas of life, from material prosperity to emotional wellness.)\n\nThis is an aptly named blend as The Star is bright and golden with a glass of joyous bubbly champagne and sweetened citrus on opening that slowly changes over to warm honey and finishes out the night with a stunning powdery finale. It can be slightly more soapy on application than I usually prefer, but that dry down with floral kissed honey and vintage creamy powder is what makes The Star a festive keeper for me. I'm curious if the overly clean scent will be tempered in the coming year or if it just my wonky chemistry that is ultimately latching onto the champagne and strong citrus.\n\nCozy (A potion for peace and contentment. The vanillic scent of very old books, winter spices drifting from the kitchen, glowing beeswax candles, a blanket around your shoulders, and a Douglas fir adorned with lights. Wear this scent when you crave stillness and silence. It has a talent for putting the outside world into decidedly softer focus.)\n\nAs it says on the tin, the vanillic scent of dusty well-loved books, a dusting of spices and the warm glow of realistic beeswax candles. The fir note is very faint on me, but that's expected as my skin eats pine. As Cozy dries down an orange note appears that dances between gourmand and atmospheric when the familiar comforting wool yarn aroma from Favorite Sweater hits my nose. I'm going to be using Cozy in unscented argan oil for this winter season, I want those beautiful fir, beeswax and yarn notes to all really amp and take me away.\n\nMauna Kea (The snow-capped domain of the sky father, Wakea and modern-day passage to the stars. This summit attracts astronomers from around the world, as its observatories are second to none. Glacial mountain air, bitter almond spiked with rosemary, white vanilla orchid, frozen coconut, and starlight. Wear this bracing blend to sharpen your senses and hone your powers of perception.)\n\nI came for the gorgeous description and stayed for the sweet delicate almond, bracing fresh coconut and familiar \"starlight\" impression from another favourite oil I now own a full bottle of. This oil is stunning and I can easily imagine the immense heavens above with winking stars and coolness from a mountain top carried with the wind. I know it sounds silly, but when I don Mauna Kea, I always feel like I'm replicating the scene from How the Grinch Stole Christmas when the Grinch realizes he is growing a heart and \"is feeling\", this is me with the coconut. Am I a coconut lover now, who will pay for and swoon with every tropical-themed release? It's hard to say and now that's all for today...uh, in any case, I LOVE Mauna Kea and will be saving up for a bottle to grace my vast vanilla collection. This is akin to Starlight & Spidersilk who took a little tropical holiday.\n\nSnowflakes & Spider Silk (Our beloved Starlight and Spidersilk takes a merry turn for the winter holidays. Slender strands of cotton flower hung with trembling dewdrops, cold crystalline musk, tiny black vanilla beans, grapefruit sorbet, fresh ginger root, and fluffy white meringue. This beguiling blend empowers you to ensnare the objects of your desire and attract every manner of earthly del"
