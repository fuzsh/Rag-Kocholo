He was certainly the most influential, and his picture easily appeared on more music covers than George M. Cohan, Nora Bayes, Anna Held or even Sophie Tucker, all contenders for in that category. Jolson was a stage performer in every way, and it shows in his films and records. He loved his adopted country as much as he did the stage, and set paradigms for performance that are still in place today. But despite his earnest talent, Jolie did not quite enjoy an immediate meteoric rise to the top from a young age, and much of his story came out of pain and misunderstanding. His beginnings as portrayed in the 1946 biographical pictures (biopic) The Jolson Story were actually a bit different than he and Hollywood brought to the screen, and some of the details actually mattered in terms of the formation of his famous broad personality. There have also been many books written about or at least mentioning facets of Jolson's life, as well as web biographies, however condensed the latter may be. While several of these sources have been well-researched, some of them have clearly depended on sketchy information at best, given what was found during the months that this essay was researched, and most on the web have significant gaps. This new account, which is compiled from government records, theatrical logs, recording logs, film archive records, hundreds of perhttps://vimeo.com/223083687iodicals, and literally thousands of newspaper accounts checked for reliability and consistency, should be closer to the real Al Jolson story, which is a bit more dramatic. There is also some observation inserted, but it is collective based on a number of informed opinions both past and present. Love him or hate him, his is still a fascinating story, so please pull up a screen and read on.\n\nFrom Russia, With Love\n\nAlbert was originally named Eizer Asa Yoelson, Eizer being his Yiddish birth name according to research done by Marc Leavey and Bruce Wexler. It was a common practice, as noted with some other Jewish-born composers on this site, to give both a Yiddish and Hebrew name at birth, Asa being the latter. The date is also at variance in many sources, as the Western (Gregorian) and Russian (Julian) calendars did not align properly in 1886, so while dates of May 26 and May 28 have been suggested, the realignment from the latter by as much as 12 days in the United States would make the adjusted date perhaps June 7-9, 1886. The traditional May 26 will be assumed for this essay. Asa was born in the shtetl of Srednik (modern day Sered&zcaron;ius), part of Russian Lithuania, the youngest child of Jewish cantor Rabbi Moshe \"Moses\" Rubin Yoelson (spelled Zaelson in Russia) and his wife Naomi Etta Cantor. His older siblings included Rose Leah (3/1879), Etta \"Ida\" (5/1880) and Tzvi Harry A. (1/12/1882). One other sibling died shortly after birth in 1879.\n\nWith increasing animosity toward the Jewish community in Lithuania and Russia as a whole in the 1890s, Rabbi Yoelson sought out a better life for his family, immigrating to the United States in 1890 to establish himself in Washington, DC, hoping to send for his wife and children at a later time. In early 1894, the rest of the family followed Moses to America, but Naomi died in 1895 soon after they had settled. This death would stay with Albert throughout his life. She was the first family member to be buried in Anacostia Cemetery in southwest Washington. On March 29, 1896, Moses married again, this time to Russian-born Chyesa \"Hessi\" \"Ida\" Yavels, whom he had known from his earlier years. They would eventually have four children of their own, including Emil Nathan (8/6/1897), Gertrude (1902), Meyer (1904), and George (7/2/1906). The 1900 enumeration showed Moses, Hessi, Rose, Etta, Harry, Emil and Hessi's mother Mary living in Washington. Moses was listed as a clergyman in that record. However, 14-year-old Albert was not with them in the home at that time.\n\nHaving not adjusted well to the death of his mother, Albert shut down for several months. After his father's remarriage, and in spite of the affections of their new stepmother, Al and Harry, as they now called themselves, frequently left home looking for adventure and trouble. During one of his sojourns in his teens, Al made it to Baltimore, Maryland, where he was held for a while (Harry recounted it to be several days instead of weeks) at St. Mary's Industrial School for Orphaned Boys, selling papers on the streets and singing in local saloons, at least until they discovered he was less than an orphan, thanks to a private detective Moses had hired. Another story, hard to substantiate but included for completeness, is that in the late winter of 1898 the 11-year-old attempted to join in the Spanish-American war effort, signing on as a singing mascot, then being sent home within a few weeks. However, the true passion that both brothers acquired from having visited DC burlesque or legitimate vaudeville houses like the National Theater was a desire to be on stage or at least in a show. They had even taken to singing on street corners for change to pay for the theater admission. Al briefly managed to briefly join the Al Reeves burlesque troupe when he was around 13, but was soon sent back home again.\n\nFrom late 1899 and into 1901, both Al and Harry managed to get work in various burlesque, then vaudeville shows, including a juvenile act written by Israel Zangwill titled Children of the Ghetto, which was staged by Wilton Lackaye at the National Theatre in Washington. He also briefly worked for the circus of Walter L. Main in October of 1902 (1899 has been cited in some sources), starting as an usher, but soon becoming a barker as well as a singer in one of their segments involving a medicine show sketch. For one of his early positions, Al traveled with tenor Frederick Ernest Moore, singing for a new form of entertainment — the illustrated song, which showed both lyrics and vignettes on tinted slides. Part of the burlesque he was in for several seasons, Moore took care of the mechanical end with the equipment while Al had to literally sell the song on stage so that customers would purchase the sheet music in the lobby, thus providing a profit for the theater and his employer. In a bid to perhaps get a little of the take, Al developed some of his internalized passion to put the songs across, but still was not able to give it his all. In an interview at the time of Moore's death in late 1924, Jolson claimed they worked together for at least five years, but it may have only been around three. Then Moore married a girl from the burlesque and settled in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Al recalled that he felt like his world had come to an end when Moore left, but maintained a relationship with him over the next two decades.\n\nFootlights and Spotlights\n\nDoing what was necessary to succeed on American stages, the brothers altered their names from Yoelson to Joelson to the more Anglicized Jolson. They created a few unique acts, and actually managed to secure representation with the growing William Morris agency while working for the Dainty Duchess Burlesquers. The most notable of their routines was \"The Hebrew and the Cadet,\" rife with the usual ethnic humor that sold on stage at that time, followed by young Al's singing. It has been postulated that in 1904, while performing at Keeney's Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, comedian James Francis Dooley suggested to Al that he try performing as many minstrels and stage actors had to that time, using burnt cork to create a blackface look. This created a virtual mask that seemed to free up the younger Jolson's inhibitions, and he suddenly became much more broad and dynamic. Accounts vary on who ultimately suggested this and when, but the Dooley story seems to be the most reliable of the recollections.\n\nIt should be noted that blackface was considered more business as usual than it was racially divisive at that time, and even though it is viewed historically with less than charitable opinions, it was also used by many blacks on stage, not just white actors. Jolson, who never showed overt signs of racism, and being of an oppressed race himself genuinely had direct sympathy for blacks, later noted that he did it because in large theaters it helped to emphasize his mouth, outlined in white, and his eyes, two important assets for an actor to convey in a large space. In most cases, such performers were simply playing themselves, not a Negro character, but on occasion, even Jolson would slip into that type of role when not singing. He often wore white gloves as well to give even more emphasis to his movements under a spotlight. A view of Jolson performing in blackface with gloves in both The Jazz Singer (1927) and The Singing Fool (1928) helps to verify this, particularly from the more distant camera shots.\n\nIn late 1904, Al and Harry formed an act with the much older Joe Palmer who was a wheelchair bound entertainer. They stuck with Palmer from October of 1904 to early November of 1905. Originally playing a hotel bellboy for part of their routine, one facet that Al added to his singing shtick was whistling, often with his fingers used to great effect. It could be either melodic or shrill, and can be witnessed in many of his film appearances as well. Over time there was some stress involved between the brothers with the amount of care and support Palmer needed off the stage, including grooming and dressing. Harry became disenchanted with Joe in November of 1905, and left the act in Kansas City, abandoning them for the last five dates of the tour. Although he endeavored to make it on his own, Harry Jolson never realized anything close to the fame his younger brother would see within the next half-decade or so. Al and Joe Continued as a duo with less success through the remainder of the month. After starting off as Palmer and Jolson in the 1906, Joe quickly realized that Al was naturally stealing the show as both a comedian and singer, and soon decided to retire from the act and go into the laundry business in Chicago so that his partner could continue untethered.\n\nNow with nothing holding him back, Al went west to California, centering on the San Francisco Bay area as they were in recovery from the April 18, 1906, earthquake and subsequent fire that partially destroyed the city. They were in need of diversions and entertainment, and it was there that Jolson took vaudeville by storm, adding many tricks to his repertoire, most of them simply broadening every aspect of his performance, intended to draw the audience in to his heart and mind. Al quickly became a reliable sensation at the Globe and Wigwam Theaters in San Francisco, both three-a-day vaudeville houses. He quickly became highly regarded for both his wit and emotional singing delivery, garnering a reputation that soon spread eastward. On tours of the Western and Midwest states he was more often than not a headliner, but frequently billed as a comedian or blackface monologist. In summer of 1906 he ventured with his new company up to Spokane, Washington, where he was well-received and reviewed. Al was soon being advertised in The Billboard and Variety as the \"Black Faced Comedian with the Operatic Voice. Never Idle.\" He would continue to thrive on the attention and energy he got from his audiences for many years to come. During the spring tour of 1907 to the Upper Midwest, Jolson was reviewed in the May 25 edition of the Duluth Evening Herald as \"The Man With the Versatile Mouth:\"\n\nIn next week's bill at the Bijou the patrons of the popular theater will see a bill of vaudeville stars such as are seldom seen in any one program. The show is headed by Al Jolson as the principal feature. Mr. Jolson has a pair of lips that are very versatile, capable of being manipulated to imitate music of the flute, a saxophone and many other musical instruments. Mr. Jolson works in cork make-up, and is one of the best and funniest comedians ever seen in vaudeville. His parodies are original, his stories new, and his imitations have no equal.\n\nWhile working in San Francisco in late 1906, Al, who was somewhat of a ladies man with his wit and charm, even if only moderately handsome and less than tall at 5'7\", made the acquaintance of dancer Henrietta Keller, a gentile lass who was two years his junior. He soon became earnest in wanting to marry her, but the eighteen-year-old was less than interested. Jolson decided to get to her through her family, although it is unclear what their take was on the singer. He clearly had an ego which inspired confidence, but it was possibly driven by the insecurity put in him by his father's lack of acceptance for his desire to be on the stage. The compensating factors created a focus that was more on himself, his career, and his personal needs, than it was on anybody else. Just the same, Henrietta finally conceded to Al's wishes, and upon his return from a second tour of the Pacific Northwest, they were married on September 20, 1907. It was the beginning of a tumultuous union that lasted nearly a dozen years, which was rather amazing given what was about to happen to Jolson's career. Despite his humble beginnings as a Russian rabbi's son, he now had growing fame, adoring audiences, was a headliner in San Francisco vaudeville, and was married to a lovely wife. Al Jolson was now living his own American dream, and not about to wake up anytime soon.\n\nA Star is Made\n\nAround the time of his marriage to Henrietta, and during a tour of the Midwest and Southern States, Jolson became a focus of minstrel show entrepreneur Lew Dockstader (a.k.a. George Alfred Clapp), who had been traveling in or running minstrel troupes for over twenty years. He had formed a successful act with George Primrose in 1898, and their troupe traveled the country on the vaudeville circuit until 1904, when Primrose left the team. Lew's new group refreshed the act a bit, then continued to keep the dying art of minstrelsy alive a bit longer despite the more current ragtime that was sweeping the country. Within a couple of years, knowing he needed to update a bit more, Lew started looking for something exciting to add to Dockstader's Minstrels, and he quickly saw it in Jolson, especially his blackface routines. Having been traveling on the Sullivan-Considine Circuit in the Midwest at the time, and by mid-1908 being noted in many locations as the highest priced single vaudeville act appearing in many locations, Al was interested in the monetary benefits as well as the added exposure. He and Henrietta soon relocated to New York for the start of Dockstader's next season in mid-August, 1908. As it turned out, Al was now working as Dockstader's second string comedian to another end man, Neil O'Brien, and the monetary benefit was nil as he was in truth initially paid considerably less than he had been making as a single in vaudeville. However, he had new audiences who clearly took to his highly energetic stage presence, pretty much entirely in blackface. According to a review in Variety in their August 29, 1908, issue:\n\nIt does appear as though Mr. Dockstader has subordinated himself for the benefit of Jolson, a newcomer in the East, young, with a pleasing personality, good voice, some new \"stuff\" and the hit of the show, not even excepting Neil O'Brien, that great \"end.\" … Jolson is the only olio act, passing over a singing monologue, with a whistling finale. He scored immediately and decidedly in it, although the talk rapidly delivered contained much dried-up matter. Jolson is a natural minstrel, however, and his stage magnetism can win out always.\n\nAl quickly became the focus of the show, and there was much more to be said about his unique talents in the March 6, 1909, edition of Variety:\n\nAl Jolson would be welcome to vaudeville in the specialty which he is using as a feature of Lew Dockstader's Minstrels. Dressing neatly in evening clothes of faultless cut and of the new color called \"taupe,\" Jolson offers a quiet quarter of an hour of smooth entertainment. As a singer of \"coon\" songs Jolson has a method of his own by which lyrics and melody are given their full value. His talk moves along nicely and is kept within proper proportion to the rest of the act. Throughout the talk Jolson introduces little tricks of speech and for a finish has an odd, eccentric vocal performance in which he sings with a peculiar buzzing note. Of course, it's flagrant trick work, but it brings him back for a sure-fire encore. For this purpose he has a whistling solo that brings another recall… As it stands now Jolson's offering is capable of holding down a place in any vaudeville show.\n\nDuring a forced break from the Dockstader show in the spring of 1909 due to booking issues, Jolson briefly went back to San Francisco for a stint with I.P. Wilkerson's \"Minstrels of Today,\" then after that show fell apart in June, toured the Keith and Orpheum circuits as a solo act, further building up his fame and repertoire. Part of July was spent at Keith and Proctor's theater in New York sharing the same stage as Louise Dresser. He returned to Dockstader for the shortened 1909 season, but for a decidedly higher salary. Although he later lauded Lew for his generous spirit and the opportunity, Al was constrained by the format of the show in a way he had not been in vaudeville, doing the routines the way his boss set them out, with only a smattering of latitude to \"improve\" upon them, further being limited by having to use older music with little contemporary material. Jolson's desire to branch out, and perhaps his feeling that he should be performing beyond his current boundaries, created some conflicts with the veteran performer. Dockstader knew that Al was bigger than the roles he was playing in the troupe, so they agreed to part ways after the season ended early at the end of 1909. Jolson then went back to the Orpheum and Martin Beck circuits.\n\nAt some point, perhaps during the minstrelsy tour, Jolson came to the attention of famed entrepreneur Florenz Ziegfeld, who was collecting talent for his upcoming third edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, already regarded as a top entertainment on Broadway. However, while working the New York City theaters in early 1910, he reportedly turned down an opportunity to audition for Ziegfeld, which was an attitude that was simply unheard of. Jolson evidently felt he did not need to entertain an audition, and believed he could snag something much better based on his reputation. Eventually, he did do quite well, but not without leaving a few bodies and gathering detractors in his wake.\n\nEfforts to locate Jolson in the 1910 enumeration proved difficult. He was probably on performance travel at that time as a headliner, and could have easily missed the enumeration while staying at a hotel or taking a train to another town. There were a couple of stretches of shows in Washington, DC, in February and April, so it is likely that he made visits to his indifferent father and accepting stepmother while there. It is unclear if Henrietta traveled with him during this period. While in Manhattan he seemed to be favored by Hammerstein's Victoria, appearing alongside some very fine acts. The hard work on the road and the continued good reviews played in Jolson's favor. After a successful summer on the Orpheum circuit back in San Francisco and Los Angeles, he appeared in Ogden and Salt Lake City, Utah in October, then went down to Louisville, Kentucky. While there, Jolson fell ill and was unable to sing or speak for some weeks. It was during this period that Al got the offer for his first big Broadway show — evidently without having to audition. Even at that, he continued the last leg of the tour up to Omaha, Nebraska, before returning to Manhattan and a final stint at Hammerstein's Victoria in February.\n\nThe Winter Garden Theater was one of the more celebrated venues in New York City. In 1911, the three Shubert Brothers, Lee, Sam and Jacob (J.J.), who had been involved in theatrical production and presentation for several years, leased an older building that had been a horse car stable, and opened what was the fourth incarnation of the Winter Garden in Midtown Manhattan at 50th and Broadway, less than a mile north of the growing Broadway theater district around Times Square. To launch their new enterprise, they commissioned Jerome Kern, still in the beginning of his career, to write a musical with some interpolated material. As one of their principals they signed Al Jolson at a healthy $250 per week.\n\nLa Belle Paree, a loosely plotted show about a wealthy widow running about Paris, which was really more of a revue of vaudeville acts, started out as a lavish production that ran nearly four hours on opening night, March 20, 1911. While Al Jolson was only something more than a minor player when the show started, his character Erastus Sparkler drew a lot of attention. Jolson almost did not make opening night, being so unnerved by his debut that he later said he walked up to 95th street instead of his 53rd street home. It was largely a matter of his participation such an unwieldy show, one that also took its toll on the audience, at least according to initial reviews. The April 15 edition of Variety noted that there were eighteen acts billed, but nineteen showed up, and that \"Rag\" was the \"high sign of the show.\" Jolson appeared well into the production, and \"turned out the third big hit, with his specialty. With position considered, Jolson equaled anyone.\" The production was quickly trimmed and reworked within the month, giving Al more of a prominent presence. Within a few weeks, he was one of the de-facto stars of the show, even without receiving a top billing. Al ad-libbed different sections every night, frequently rewrote some of the verses to his songs, and changed the show up on a regular basis, prompting some people to attend multiple performances over time. The initial run closed in June since poor ventilation of the time in an older building created comfort issues for audiences and performers alike. However, Al Jolson was now a rising star, and when they reopened for a week in September he received very favorable reviews and multiple curtain calls and encores. He would spend the next fifteen years on top of Broadway, without ever having to audition or play in the Ziegfeld Follies to achieve his fame.\n\nNearly as soon as La Belle Paree ended its brief national tour and return to New York, Vera Violetta opened on November 20, 1911, a week after its out-of-town tryouts, and once again at the Winter Garden. Also a loosely plotted revue set in a Paris skating rink, one of the highlights of the show as it was reviewed was Jolson's singing. He performed That Haunting Melody by George M. Cohan, and Rum Tum Tiddle by Jean Schwartz and Edward Madden. These would be his initial records cut for Victor one month later at his first known successful recording session, and the beginning of a long run in that medium, continuing for 21 years with little in the way of pauses. Jolson would return to the Victor studios on three occasions in 1912 and 1913, resulting in some fascinating takes on ragtime era music. Up until that time, the most prominent comedic male singing star had been Billy Murray. They would both share the spotlight in the recording field as the decade progressed, but Jolson would pretty much own the stage, and reportedly was paid more for his dozen Victor discs than any artist up to that time.\n\nThis new success appeared to create stress in Al's marriage to Henrietta, who was interested in spending more time with her now-famous husband, in part so they could start a family. Jolson's family was now his adoring audiences, and one of his main challenges appeared to be converting those who did not yet seem to love him, so his wife's notion was set aside for the time being. There were other continents to conquer as well, and Jolson was up to the challenge. Vera Violetta went to the West End in London for a short but successful run in early 1912, then Al returned to Broadway to star in the next show in what was becoming a veritable assembly line of revues and musicals tailored to his particular talents.\n\nBroadway Lights and Winter Garden Nights\n\nAt nearly the same time Charlie Chaplin was developing his iconic \"Tramp\" character, Al Jolson sought to take his blackface act a bit further and create a character of his own. Thus, it was in the Shubert's next Winter Garden extravaganza for March of 1912, encompassing no less than three different acts for the evening (later two), for the final act, A Whirl of Society, Gus sauntered onto the stage. By this time it was clear that Jolson was the star, and was billed as such. But ironically, in the theaters he was more known for his blackface appearance than in his natural state, while at other venues he would take over the stage as himself. Gus embodied this by being many things that Jolson was not—at least outwardly. Laid back, humble, a more rural than urban wit, Gus was an observer of the world, and able to comment on it without offending all that many people. His delivery was, for the most part, not a stereotyped ethic Negro dialect but simply Jolson as a character knowing that his face was blackened. And yet his soul was universal. \"Gus\" would continue to appear in most of the future Jolson stage shows. Actually, per a later interview with Jolson, \"Gus\" was originally the character Erastus Sparkler from his prior show, but one evening a cast member forgot his name on stage and called him \"Gus.\" The name immediately stuck like glue for the next decade.\n\nAs Jolson was in the last act of the evening, his growing fan base often asked him to remain after the encores and sing some of their favorite ragtime songs. To that end, he had the Winter Garden install a runway that went into the audience almost to the rear so he could connect with them on a more intimate basis, walking out into the middle of the theater or even further. He later explained that kidding with the audience and confiding with them about inside information that they think nobody else knew about created a better connection. This runway was utilized especially for his free Sunday evening concerts. Since laws in New York City prevented theatrical performances on Sunday at that time, several musicians would gather for planned ad-hoc concerts, but without makeup or costumes, precluding the theatrical element. These were often actors who could not hear each other in their respective shows, so gathered with a feeling of camaraderie. Jolson was usually last or second-to-last for such performances, and often spent more time on the runway than the stage. Even though it displaced several seats or part of the middle aisle, the fact that all of the remaining seats were occupied for eight or more shows a week was hardly lost on the Shuberts, so he got his way. Also, in the generation of musicals that preceded those filled with songs that were directly connected to the plot, bigger stars like Jolson could readily pick songs that they particularly liked, and the writers would somehow find a way to fit them into whatever meager plot that held the production together in a loosely cohesive manner. So if something wasn't working, he could pick another tune to replace it, and often got his way with that. The build-up of his repertoire also facilitated his post-show concerts.\n\nGiven how busy Tin Pan Alley was with turning out all variety of ragtime-driven songs and maudlin ballads at that time, there was plenty of material for Jolson to choose from. By the time of A Whirl of Society, the publishers and composers were coming to him. He might also hear something at another venue on one of his rare off nights, or perhaps at a dinner party, and decide to latch onto it. As was the growing tradition of the time, if a star liked a song, they were asked to endorse it, usually with their name and picture on the cover. In Jolson's case, unlike years past with the elaborate illustrated covers with a 3\" circle showing the performer, he literally took over half or more of the cover in many cases. It was only in rare cases that Al would appear on sheet music in blackface, as most of them showed a more professional shot of his true likeness. A number of tunes of the 1910s and into the 1920s that he adopted would be released initially with a traditional illustrated cover, but once Jolson associated himself with the number, those covers were replaced with his likeness. As long as the music sold and the pieces were creating royalty revenue, most publishers could forgive this bit of vanity, and some of them may have actually been responsible for it.\n\nOne of the songs interpolated into A Whirl of Society, which had nothing to do with any plot, almost did not happen. Composer Lewis Muir already had a string of minor hits behind him, and had just composed When Ragtime Rosie Ragged the Rosary. L. Wolfe Gilbert, a writer for the New York Clipper, wrote a column attacking the song as sacrilege, and derided both the composer and the publisher. The two ran into each other a few days later, and Muir asked Gilbert about any hits he had written. Gilbert named some obscure publications that Muir had never heard of. Gilbert then challenged Muir to write a song with him if he was so talented. They went to Muir's home that evening and turned out a love ballad and a Dixie chorus. The very next morning, they took their songs to Muir's publisher, Frederick A. Mills. Mills told them the ballad stank, and that Dixie songs were now passé. He offered Gilbert a batch of songs to show him what Mills Music published. Gilbert left steaming, then realized he hadn't taken the packet songs offered him and that he had left his manuscript. He came back in and Mills asked him to play that Dixie tune again because he couldn't seem get it out of his head. A few weeks later, Jolson introduced Waiting for the Robert E. Lee in A Whirl of Society, and it has been a favorite ever since, perpetually in his repertoire. One other work, the parody song My Sumurun Girl, was the first to have Jolson a co-writing credit attached to it, Al having supplied some or even most of the clever lyrics.\n\nIn order to understand Al Jolson's complex personality and motivations, it is helpful to understand some of his back story, as told here. In spite of his ego and constant need to perform, which interfered with his marriage, as did dalliances with other women, Jolson really did have a big heart and a soft spot for those who had helped him along during the years, and many loyal friends who often fiercely defended him. One of the better examples of this unfailing streak of professional integrity played out during the late spring of 1912. Part of the way through the run of the A Whirl of Society run, Lew Dockstader opened with his latest show at the Broadway Theater. He had not been doing quite so well in the wake of many changes occurring on the American stage, and a step away from the now-outdated minstrelsy. The review from the New York Times of May 28, 1912, tells the story:\n\n'MAMA'S BABY BOY' REALLY VERY BAD; Will Probably Bore Even That Supposedly Stupid Person — the Tired Business Man. … Well, a bad beginning sometime, promises a good ending. And this particular entertainment (word used by courtesy) is certainly a \"bad baby.\" … At one point of the proceedings Lew Dockstader, somewhat uncertain of his lines, sang songs and told jokes, and was given the applause accorded to an old favorite. But the unexpected arrival of Al Jolson from the Winter Garden, to proclaim Mr. Dockstader as his real discoverer, created more enthusiasm than all the rest of the show together.\n\nJolson proclaimed, perhaps focused on the dignity of his benefactor, that his two years with Dockstader were among the happiest in his life, even if he \"didn't eat regular.\" He then did an impromptu performance of Rum Tum Tiddle, then exited the building, having perhaps saved the evening from ruin.\n\nAfter a brief summer break, no doubt filled with performances somewhere, Jolson went on the road with A Whirl of Society, complete with his runway. Returning in December, he was commissioned to write an article for Variety which appeared in their December 20, 1912, issue, some of which is excerpted here:\n\nIf the manager of the Springer Opera House, Columbus, Ga., had told me when I played this theatre with Lew Dockstader that I should be writing this for VARIETY, within a few years, I would have been compelled to tell him some things that would not have read well.\n\nThen I had no idea that the star dressing room, with the bath attached, would be assigned to me. I was happy to use a bucket to wash up, and if I did not have to go into the next block above the theatre for the water I was pleased. Now, I am not allowed to do anything! There is the manager asking if everything is O-K and the house carpenter wants the property man to establish drayage records and make my room look like a reception parlor where my friends may watch me at my trade. Everyone is so solicitous, while I cannot see how I am any better than I was when I played forty weeks of \"one-nighters.\"…\n\nMaybe the question you are asking yourself is, is he happy after all? I can say this—that the fuss and fury that are lavished on a featured member of a musical show is something I cannot understand. I am not ashamed to say that I had as much fun out of life while playing the southern tier of towns in Alabama as I have had since. New York is the natural goal of every player and to be a favorite there is something every one hopes for, but when you analyze the facts, and get down to essentials, it is easy to see that you can be as happy with a group of real friends outside of New York as in it.\n\nI know that there are many things you can get in the metropolis that you can not have elsewhere, but there are other factors that compensate in the hinterland, so its \"six of one and half dozen of the other.\" We long for the unattainable and when we get half way there we start to realize that the game can be played in one community as well as another, and when all's said and done, it merely means that one has found one's place and made a few friends upon whom he can count through thick and thin. Then with good health and a loving wife, what more can anyone look for in this world?\n\nI am a firm believer in Marcus Aurelius and his stoic attitude toward the world. That attitude makes one feel content with conditions as they appear, and while others may feel the need of lavish attention, I will continue on my histrionic way without any heart flutterings. Should conditions make it necessary for me to return to the bucket and sponge, with three fellow minstrels in the same dressing room, I will feel as light-hearted as I do today, with my name featured on the electric sign (for which the show shares with the house) and in all the \"ads.\"\n\nAt the beginning of 1913, The Shuberts decided to reward their golden goose, the one who had turned the Winter Garden into a focal point. It was reported in Variety on February 28 that they paid him a bonus of $10,000 to sign a seven-year contract to appear under their management, with a sliding salary scale to boot. The terms were a minimum of $1,000 per week with a guarantee of at least 35 weeks of each year, eventually sliding up to $2,000 a week. This was far beyond his starting salary with the Shuberts that amounted had to $250 a week, which was still exceptional for 1911. Variety also noted that Jolson was able to command $1,500 for a single week on the vaudeville stage for two-a-day appearances. The Shubert contract was obviously more lucrative, since it assured him continuing work and income. At 28 years of age, Jolson had made it big, being one of the highest-paid entertainers in New York, if not the highest, given the terms. Given how little entertainers had been regarded and compensated just two decades before, this, along with the revenue pouring in to Tin Pan Alley publishers, could be regarded as a notable point in the rise of entertainment as an industry, not just a pastime.\n\nThe Shubert crew went into rehearsals in early 1913 for Jolson's next big vehicle, The Honeymoon Express. Among other firsts, this production became the official debut of Jolson on film. There is a chase between a train, presumably the Express, and an automobile, that was portrayed on film projected in the front of the stage, and showing Jolson as \"Gus\" driving the car. The chase ended live on the stage when the screen was retracted and the real car and train revealed. This spectacular entertainment opened the first week of February, 1913, at the Winter Garden, starring French actress Gaby Deslys However, Jolson's name was also in large letters on the marquee. On opening night, with a level of seeming cavalier disregard for the production, part way into the show, which was apparently running long, he asked the audience, \"Do you want to hear the rest of the story, or do you want to hear me?\" The cheering crowd chose Jolson, and he literally stopped the show, calling on the cast to just relax and sit down. There was perhaps no other rising star that could get away with such shenanigans. Be assured that he likely did all of his numbers from the current show. In the case of The Honeymoon Express, one of those songs would be one of his primary signature pieces to the end of his life.\n\nJoe McCarthy and James V. Monaco had written some songs together, and brought this particular piece as a ragtime one step to publisher Harry Von Tilzer, who subsequently rejected the tune. One of Von Tilzer's song pluggers, Nemo Roth, was a friend of the composers. While it was his job to promote Von Tilzer tunes at events like dance contests, he sometimes knew enough to take a chance on a rogue entry. Roth was at a Brooklyn dance event one evening prepared to sing Am I In Love published by his employer, but Monaco and McCarthy asked if he would try their tune instead. The singer had been downing large quantities of beer that evening, and by the time he got up to perform for the crowd his coherence had been considerably dimmed. Because of this temporary impediment, Roth had to sing the piece You Made Me Love You at a much slower pace, instantly (if accidentally) transforming a ragtime song into a tear-jerker of a ballad. Even though Harry, who was present, was clearly irritated by the substitution, by the end of the performance he acknowledged that it was a tune with great possibilities. The following week he presented it to his friend Jolson for interpolation into The Honeymoon Express, which was already running. As Gaby Deslys had departed from the show by that time, Jolson was the clear star, and was able to pull stunts like bringing in a new song. After its performance, the singer was called back to stage over a dozen times. It may have been a little trick he pulled, that of going down on one knee to deliver the closing \"gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, what I cry for...\" While he frequently said it was due to an ingrown toenail causing him pain on that foot, it was actually an effective method of engaging the audience. Milton Berle later insisted that singer Blossom Seeley had originated the move prior to Jolson's dramatic use of it. Ironically, it was Harry's brother Will Von Tilzer who ended up publishing the piece under his Broadway Music imprint, with Jolson's name at the top.\n\nThe World According to Jolson\n\nFor all of his bravado and bigger-than-life stage presence, Al Jolson showed many signs of insecurity offstage and backstage. Opening nights - even if it was the same play in a different city - were horrific for him, and he sometimes needed to have a convenient bucket just behind the proscenium to lose his last meal, sent up by a case of excessive nerves. He also had insecurities that every new audience might not revere him as much as he would like, and he tried earnestly to win their fealty through every single performance. If other performers were getting equal applause to his, he would have them removed from the show he was in, or refuse to share the stage. Jolson reportedly had the habit of leaving the water running in his dressing room so he would not hear how much applause the other entertainers were getting! Offstage, however, Jolson was a competitive man when it came to perceptions of him. He performed for a great many charities, those in association with his Jewish faith being the most important. He was also somewhat of a misogynist when it came to women, including the ones he was married to. Many chorus girls who were in his shows may have exhibited a bit of a blush when they were around Jolson, with whom they very well may have had a liaison. Jolson also had a bit of a temper, but it was usually easily managed, and he was actually considered by many to be amicable, even to the stage crew and the musicians. He found one way of separating his professional and personal life, particularly with his loyal friends and colleagues who tolerated his sometimes-epic quirks. In public, he was Al Jolson, but in private, they could call him Jolie — and he often did the same, referring to himself in the third person.\n\nAnd what of Harry Jolson? He had remained active in vaudeville since his separation from Al in 1905, and fared well enough as a singer an actor that he was still getting favorable notices in the 1910s. However, as his younger brother became more famous, the approaching shadow grew longer. By 1914, many of the notices in the trade papers made it clear that Harry Jolson was Al Jolson's brother, either as a point of reference or of comparison. He appeared to not be destined for the bigger stages or houses that Al now commanded, and over time this built up a level of resentment in the man who felt partially responsible for his younger brother's career choice and subsequent success. As with Al, Harry worked quite often in blackface, and was said to have a clear speaking and singing voice, sometimes with the term \"operatic\" applied to it. Just the same, he likely seethed at such erroneous assertions as one found in the Albany [New York] Times Union of August 16, 1915, stating that \"Harry Jolson is a brother of the famous Al Jolson, and this younger member of the family is recognized as a black faced comedian with few superiors.\" Al's rising star created a wall of animosity between the brothers, even if unfairly, and their relationship became tenuous at best throughout their remaining lives.\n\nThere remains some controversy among entertainment and music historians as to how much credit Jolie deserved for the collective of songs that bear his name as co-composer. Starting with My Sumurun Girl, and especially during the 1920s, Jolson would somehow infer himself not only onto the cover of a piece, but the composition credits as well. He might change a lyric or two, or perhaps play with a melody or syncopation that he felt improved the piece. While this did not go over well with some songwriters, there were many who knew that Jolson's name meant some additional sales and performances of their pieces, even if his angle was to derive some of the monetary benefits from royalties. There were a few cases in which Al made somewhat significant contributions to a song, and even a full verse in one important instance, but for the most part his input was arguably negligible. Would the composers have done as well without Jolie in their court? Many of them would confirm that, especially one young man who will be discussed later.\n\nAfter just over a year with Victor Records, Al was courted by the Columbia Graphophone Company (later Columbia Records), and they signed him to a multi-year contract. He made records exclusively for them from June of 1913 until the end of 1923, numbering at least 75 sides culled from over 200 takes. Columbia quality was about as good as could be derived from the recording horn technology of the time, and even a century later when played back on a good Victrola or Columbia phonograph, there is an element of presence in Jolson's clear and succinct voice that was not as prominent in his later electronic recordings. It was a rare occasion when the house orchestra overwhelmed Al's voice, a hazard that many singers encountered in those early days when the ensembles were all crowded into a little space around the recording horn. Jolson also managed to convey much of his stage persona in the studio as well, sometimes breaking into his dialogues in the middle of a take, and engaging the audience at the consumer end of the phonograph. Many of the finest examples of ragtime era singing and interpretations were captured on these discs, of which virtually all are available in digital form on CDs or downloads.\n\nThe Honeymoon Express went on tour in late 1913 and played in a number of theaters for the next several months, including a run at the Garrick in Chicago in January of 1914. The show and other vaudeville engagements outside of the Shubert contract kept Al busy through much of the year. Then on October 10, his next production was launched. Dancing Around was the same type of loosely plotted show that he had now become used to, but Jolson needed a malleable vehicle in which he could interpolate whatever songs he wanted in addition to frequently breaking the fourth wall to connect directly with the audience. In addition to his now-expected \"Gus\" character, he also played \"Monsieur Jean\" for part of the show, requiring a bit of makeup magic to switch between the two. The plot was also more topical than his prior plays had been, focusing on the growing war between Germanic countries and the United Kingdom. To that end, it included the new British hit It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary and several songs by Sigmund Romberg, Harry Carroll and Harold Atteridge. Yet the opening night lineup did not prevent Jolson from switching numbers out in the short term.\n\nOne of the first interpolations was Sister Susie's Sewing Shirts for Soldiers, another British tune that he quickly latched onto once he caught wind of it. It had been introduced by American singer Jack Norworth (former husband of the charismatic Nora Bayes) in England, but once Jolie appropriated the number it was pretty much his by proxy. He would do a couple of verses of this charming tongue twister, and then issue a challenge to the audience members. To any man who could properly navigate the tricky rapid-fire chorus at a decent speed without bobbling it, he offered a new hat or five dollars, and to any women who would meet his challenge she would get either a new hat or a ten-pound box of chocolate. Evidently, he rarely paid up, knowing that the combination of stage fright (with which he was all too familiar) and the intimidation of his mere presence would yield a fluffed performance. Except for one occasion in particular, that is. A week after he recorded this number for Columbia in December, complete with a reduction of the staged routine with an audience (which sounds like it was all men), an executive from the recording company accepted the challenge, produced a portable phonograph, and proceeded to play a fresh pressing of the record. Everybody got a good laugh from that. The sheet music cover of the American edition showed Jolson both as himself and as Gus in blackface, but less than three years later during the American involvement in the war it was changed to a more appropriate format, displaying a larger image of Al without the makeup.\n\nDancing Around played for a solid run of 145 performances into February of 1915, after which it went on an extended national tour. Between fulfilling his obligation to the Shuberts and numerous other engagements along the way, Jolson did not make it into the Columbia studios for the entirety of 1915. In virtually every large and medium town in which he appeared, there was excitement and a flurry of press coverage, some of it often making it back into New York papers and Variety. Many of the accounts mentioned his now famous rose-tinted elevated runway installed in each of the theaters, and the fact that there were only four Jolson songs in the show, but another dozen or more would follow the final curtain. Al did, however, have to contend with some of the foibles of national fame, and not just from adoring female fans, of which there were many. It appears that opportunists were creating endorsements with Jolson's picture, not the least of which appeared on sheet music covers. To that end he fired a shot across the bow in a full-page warning published in Variety near the end of the year, which tried to sound amicable and menacing all at once:\n\nCertain Music Publishers throughout the country have fallen into the habit of printing my photograph as the frontispiece of songs which I have never sung, or even rehearsed—and which I wouldn't sing. I raise no objection to the publication of my photograph on such songs as I have sung, and am singing. But I am impelled to warn publishers who print my picture on unauthorized music, that I shall hold them to strict accountability, unless they have my written permission.\n\nAfter the tour ended near the end of 1915, Al took a breather, perhaps reconnecting with Henrietta, but in an increasingly discordant relationship, given his long absences and the dalliances about which she had heard many stories. His charm and pleading could only overcome so much, but she still remained in their home for the time being. Then it was back to work in early 1916, recording for Columbia in January, in addition to preparation for his next starring vehicle, the eclectic Robinson Crusoe, Jr., with a plot that seemed to have little to do with the famous Daniel Defoe novel. But even during the rehearsal phase there was new controversy with the sometimes-volatile star.\n\nThe Shuberts thought it wise, given Jolson's sometimes unpredictable nature, to have an understudy for their star's role(s). To that end, according to a story in the February 25, 1916 issue of Variety, they retained an actor from another show that had just left for the road to do so. J.J. Shubert instructed vaudevillian Lou Holtz, who also had experience with blackface entertainment, to learn the script and observe Jolson on the stage, albeit hidden away in the balcony, and without the star's knowledge. Holtz believed this move by Shubert to be on the level, and consented, albeit being careful to not be seen by Jolson. As it, ironically, predictably turned out, Al Jolson would simply not be understudied, at least for this show, and was professional enough to not walk out on the production despite the occasional displeasure with how it was progressing. Once the show opened successfully, Holtz approached J.J. and asked him what his role would be now. J.J. feigned ignorance, having no idea who Lou was, even though he had \"hired\" him. Holtz went to Lee Shubert, who also, perhaps honestly, had no idea of who the actor was. After enough back and forth between the brothers who had disavowed this understudy, much less the concept that he was needed, Holtz realized he had been had. He took his lesson learned story to Variety, which usually published any backstage gossip like this of interest to their readership that had some basis in reliabile truth, complying in this case as well. Holtz went on to his own moderately successful career.\n\nMost of the primary actors in Robinson Crusoe, Jr. played multiple roles throughout the production, which took place in multiple historical time periods. Jolson played \"Gus\" again, the chauffer of another character, as well as \"Good Friday,\" the equivalent of Crusoe's man Friday from the novel, and \"Fatima,\" the beautiful slave girl. In all, there were 27 musical numbers in the original Romberg score, of which Al commanded four amidst a cast of nearly 200, including dancers and chorus. One of those was the first hit for composer and pianist Pete Wendling. Hawaiian songs had become quite popular by this time, and Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula as performed by Jolson inspired many more to be written. Another \"Dixie\" number was the beautiful Down Where the Swanee River Flows, which in some regards was a harbinger of the songs Mammy and Rock-a-bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody, both yet to be written. For a time, Jolson held tightly to that piece, insisting that he be the only performer with exclusive rights to it, but an announcement in Variety in November of 1916 showed that the performer had \"granted us [Broadway Music] permission\" to release the tune, noting that they had enjoyed \"a deluge of requests for a copy of the song from performers all over the country.\" Such was his brand that Jolie actually managed to control some facets of the publishing business of Tin Pan Alley.\n\nHowever, one of the pieces quickly interpolated into the show was either composed in response to it or perhaps just as a random afterthought that seemed like it should have been there on opening night. Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday and Saturday Night was perfect Jolson material, and brought the house down once he started performing it. Both this and Down Where the Swanee River Flows were also big hits when released on Columbia Records that April. Whether Romberg became even more discouraged by an actor overriding his musical vision for the show was something apparently kept out of the trade papers.\n\nJolson felt that once he had adopted a song it was his exclusively until he said otherwise, and in some cases, performers would institute lawsuits for such rights to a piece. In the case of Where did Robinson Crusoe Go, within two weeks of his recording it in February, it was already purloined by another star. On March 13, Belle Baker was on stage at the highly regard Palace vaudeville theater, one of the venues Jolson had inexplicably never officially been invited to play, and proceeded to sing Robinson Crusoe while Jolson was in one of the front row seats. When she encored the piece, Belle called out \"Come on, Al, join in.\" This was too much for him to handle - playing second fiddle to a dame who had stolen his material. He bolted out of the theater immediately, and returned the next day with his friend, publisher Ted Snyder, who insisted upon the Palace manager that Miss Baker should no longer use that material. However, her husband Lou Leslie noted that they had bought it from a music store fair and square, and he had created his own arrangement, so Belle continued to perform it defiantly for some time. Jolie did not always get his way with women.\n\nRobinson Crusoe, Jr. made it through 139 performances at the Winter Garden Theater through mid-June. It should be noted that this was one of the earliest instances, at least in the world of the Shuberts, where the star's name appeared above the title of the show on the marquee, casting no doubt on who the audience was going to see and hear that evening. The same practice continued as the show toured the country for the remainder of the year. Broadway shows had gone on tour before, but this was the most extensive enterprise to date, and one of the first that extended over a year with essentially the same cast. Such tours would become a standard practice for a Jolson show. During a couple of breaks, Al laid down a few more tracks for Columbia, but no major hits. When the production reached the Belasco Theatre in Washington, DC that October, where Al had played with Lew Dockstader a mere seven years prior, he extended an invitation to his family to attend the performance while President Woodrow Wilson was in the audience. He had hoped that his gestures of the past few years, including buying his parents a nice new home and coming for cordial visits, might have softened his father's stance a bit. His continuing quest for Moshe's approval was to no avail that evening, as it coincided with the Sabbath, and Rabbi Yoelson was singing in the temple. This was one of many such incidents in Jolson's personal life that would eventually culminate in a way that would change virtually the entire world of entertainment in just over a decade.\n\n\"America's Greatest Entertainer\"\n\nThe tour of Robinson Crusoe, Jr. picked up again in 1917, hitting the Midwest and even westward from there. But a change was coming that would temporarily mute such activity. War had been waged in Europe over the past two years, and despite campaign promises to avoid American involvement, President Wilson found he had little recourse but to bring America's might to the battlefield and defend Britain and France from their Germanic aggressors. There had been a lot of anti-war protesting up to that point, so Wilson and his staff had recruited celebrities to not only try to change the tide of public opinion, but raise money to support the effort as well. Since the initial call in mid-1917 was to build up troops, but not yet send them to Europe, the primary focus was on morale and patriotism, and both songwriters and performers were on board to do just that, whether it be for the cause of the country or themselves. Even during the Robinson Crusoe, Jr. tour, Al made sure to show up at rallies and similar public events around the country. He even helped pen a couple of pieces in 1918 that would find their way to records, including his confrontational Tell That to The Marines.\n\nAs 1918 began, Jolson's marriage to Henrietta was more or less over, perhaps having died even a couple of years prior. He tried hard to woo her with gifts and promises, as well as all manner of reconciliation attempts, but to no avail. She simply wanted out, and wanted Al out as well. At the same time, Harry wanted back in to his brother's inner circle and life, at least in theory. His vaudeville career had been on the wane, and the shadow that his younger brother cast was considerable, and inescapable. Even if he despised the notion that he was being billed as \"Al Jolson's Brother,\" at some point he started to count on that in his publicity as a ploy to draw in audiences. While Al would likely not have shared the stage with him, he did make Harry his manager in name, although there is little evidence that the older Jolson actually managed. It appears that the gesture was intended to warrant a payroll handout that helped them both save face.\n\nAlmost two years to the day after Robinson Crusoe, Jr. had premiered, and after its record-breaking tour, the next Shubert production starring Jolson made its debut on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1918 following a tryout in New Haven, Connecticut. Sinbad, or as it was listed in the copyright records, Sinbad with Al Jolson, was another tale that had only scant references to the original Sinbad the Sailor storyline, as well as Arabian Nights. As with its predecessor it also took place in multiple time periods, and the star again took on two parts - the inescapable \"Gus\" character, and another called \"Inbad the Porter,\" both in his usual blackface. Sigmund Romberg and Harold Atteridge were responsible for most of the show's music, and Jolson saw to it that he was responsible for replacing some of it. Even though the Shuberts were now billing him as \"America's Greatest Entertainer,\" on opening night, he had his vomit buckets at the ready on either side of the stage, wondering if the audience might love and accept him as the same character in a new setting. It really didn't matter to them, as long as they heard Jolie doing what he did best — sing his heart out.\n\nSome of Al's best songs to date were debuted in Sinbad, or soon added to it. N'Everything had already been recorded in December for a Columbia disc, and although not part of the official score was interpolated now and then, given his alleged role in writing the lyrics. The same was true for the mildly risqué I'll Say She Does, put in later in 1918. The star also implicated himself into the songwriting process of the original score, both music and lyrics this time— it was \"his\" show as much or more than it was the Shuberts' or Romberg's—by not only insisting on the legal right to improvise new verses as he saw fit, even asking that they be included in the sheet music, but by also taking a share of the profits as well. In a twist of irony, none of the Sinbad tunes with his name attached in that regard went very far in terms of sheet music sales or adoption by other performers. However, the interpolated material provided some of his strongest numbers yet. In all fairness, it should be considered that many of his better songs were written with Bud G. De Sylva, who was primarily a lyricist. So even if he had assistance in creating the score from his original melody, so did his friend Irving Berlin, who always had an arranger at his side since he could not notate at all well. Therefore, it should be considered that Jolson actually did have enough musical acumen to have composed some of his music, as well as contributed to the lyric content of at least some of the pieces that share his name.\n\nThree of the most prominent tunes were all Dixie-based songs. The first, part of the original score, was the lyrical and plaintive Rock-a-bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody by Jean Schwartz, Sam Lewis and Joe Young. It was a well-crafted and deftly performed song so deeply associated with Jolson throughout his life that even tribute performances by artists like Judy Garland were viewed as mere imitations. His performances of the piece on film, and later on radio and records of the 1940s, clearly seemed corny to many. However, when he clutched at his heart in broad gestures and started to cry out in earnest \"Mammy, mammy, listen to what they're playin', Weep No More My Lady, sing it again for me. And remember Old Black Joe? I love you mammy, you had me on your knee,\" in front of a crowd of 1,500 or more on a theater stage, he was conveying all he had to the back row as much to the front, and it simply was not too much for them. In fact, it was often just enough to make them shed a tear or two. That was the essence of both the well-crafted verse and memorable chorus of Rock-a-bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody, and its impact on the musical and stage world should not be taken too lightly, given that it is still familiar a century later.\n\nEven though it is hard to substantiate, there are several corroborating stories on another method that Jolson had of collecting \"new\" material for his act. From time to time, when he wasn't on stage, he would circulate through the vaudeville and burlesque houses of whatever city he was in, reportedly with a notepad. If he liked a song or a joke that seemed like it would work for him, it would be written down, then often incorporated into his own act within a day or two. Once he performed it and it proved successful, he felt he owned it, and that only Jolie should benefit from it. The performer who had unwittingly provided Al with the material would suddenly find himself with a legal injunction preventing him from using \"Mr. Jolson's\" material. There were a few instances that made it into the trade papers of those performers attempting to wrestle with Jolson's lawyers in court, but they were usually unsuccessful in their attempts, and had to develop different material, knowing there was a risk it may also be appropriated if Jolson was in the area.\n\nOne of the later interpolations into Sinbad, which ran off and on for well over three years, was the 1921 number My Mammy by Lewis and Young to music by Walter Donaldson. Another beautiful melody with a somewhat overdrawn but still genuine sentiment, it became Jolie's ultimate blackface and whiteface number. My Mammy was a later highlight of the show, and one of his more frequently recorded and performed numbers. It was also one of the most parodied when other entertainers did imitations of Jolson, flattering or otherwise. Warner Brothers, who had made a relative fortune on his movies of the late 1920s, occasionally had a black cartoon character deliver a \"Mammy\" line in Jolson style, usually with hands clasped and sometimes down on one knee, and even the Disney cartoon studio wasn't above trying that stunt a couple of times. Although it comes across as derisive in a more enlightened time, this was simply a product of the times, and a stereotype that Jolson and many of his black fans and colleagues had little or no issue with.\n\nThen there was that song that Jolson adopted, a move that potentially made the composer famous, and may or may not have launched his career into the stratosphere, where it likely would have gone anyway. During the second season of Sinbad in New York, another show playing down the street was The Capitol Revue. It was co-written by a 20-year-old composer who had already been working in Tin Pan Alley publishing firms for four years, starting as a song plugger and moving up to the position of a show writer. In fact, Mose Gumble, the manager of Jerome H. Remick Music who had hired him to play the piano, sent him scuffling along when the lad brought him a song and had the nerve to ask if they would publish it. \"You're here as a pianist, not a writer. We've got plenty of writers under contract.\" This did not deter the talented teen, and he persevered. One of the songs included in The Capitol Revue had been reportedly dashed off in just fifteen minutes with lyricist Irving Caesar, and it should have been a hit, but sales in both the lobby and the music stores during the first few weeks of the show were sparse. As later recounted by Caesar, George took it to a party (Caesar was not present), allegedly held in a high-priced brothel where Jolson was in attendance. Bud De Sylva knew of the piece and suggested that Al take a listen. Al was sufficiently convinced after hearing the compelling rendition at the piano with De Sylva singing the vocal. He turned to his current musical director, Al Goodman, and said \"I'll bring that in Thursday night.\" So it was that Swanee was quickly interpolated into Sinbad, after which Al recorded it, and the song instantly took off. Not only that, it was quickly reprinted with Jolson's picture dominating the cover. Whether Jolson's adoption of Swanee was a launching point for the professional career of George Gershwin is debatable, but it likely didn't hurt him, as within ten days the song was in high demand. Swanee also became a big hit the following year in the British show Jig-Saw, likely helped along by Jolson's endorsement. That made Gershwin a viable commodity in the UK as well, and he spent quite a bit of the 1920s there.\n\nThere were several instances, starting with the bold stunt he pulled in The Honeymoon Express, in which Jolson would stop the show part way into the second act, quickly recount the obvious components of the remaining plot to the audience, then ask them whether wanted to see the rest of the show or hear him sing instead. Usually getting approval for the latter, Jolie dismissed the cast, then he would launch into an hour or more of songs with the orchestra, who were evidently seasoned enough by this time to expect such behavior from the star. However, there was one evening at the Winter Garden during his show Bombo that Jolie seemed distracted by something unexpected, at least to him. He kept staring at four vacant seats in one of the front rows. Finally, whether it was real or an act, he appeared unable to accept this anomaly, stopped the show, and insisted that the audience bow their heads in silence in the memory of those poor people who had evidently met their demise earlier in the day. That had to be it, because that was the only reason anybody would miss a Jolson performance. He would often continue his post-finale concerts well into the night, and when asked to vacate the theater, would take the remaining audience to a local eatery such as Lindy's to continue his show. George Burns, who attended many Jolson performances, quipped that Jolie never really ended his shows; he just wore out the audience.\n\nEven though Jolson was now clearly a brand, and a force of nature in multiple worlds, that was not enough for Henrietta. In dealing with her discontent, Al sent her back to California and her family at one point in 1918 or early 1919, evidently without bothering to visit her often, albeit working a rigorous schedule on the road. When Al filled out his draft record on September 12, 1918, he noted that he was residing at the Hotel Biltmore, and was in the midst of the second run of Sinbad at the Century Theater, another Shubert venue. Harry Jolson listed his employer as the Palace Theater, the revered stage that had not yet asked Jolson to appear, and and which in some regards was his white whale. Neither brother served in the military given that they were more valuable on the home front, a bit old, and had registered near the end of the war. However, Al had been involved in bond drives, special benefits, and even entertainments at some stateside camps, something he would revisit a quarter century later with a different focus.\n\nIt was at an Army Tank Corps benefit, U.S. Tanks, held at the Century Theater (the Hippodrome has been cited but no matching event was found there), on Sunday, September 15, 1918, that Jolson came up with one of his most famous tag lines. The bill was daunting, even for Jolie. In addition to several prominent vaudeville stars, including Master of Ceremonies, seasoned comedian Ed Wynn, the three headliners were George M. Cohan, famous tenor Enrico Caruso, and Jolson himself. As the evening progressed the acts got bigger. Finally, more than three hours in, Cohan did his patriotic bit with Over There and other flag wavers like Yankee Doodle Boy. When Caruso came out, Wynn couldn't even introduce him properly, so vigorous was the audience reception once they heard his name. Enrico set forth with an Italian war song, then a set of tenor variations on Cohan's Over There, followed by an improvised aria. Caruso was called back to the stage for several bows and a couple of encores. The applause for the sensational and storied operatic performer was thunderous, and perhaps a bit much for Jolson to stomach. Al evidently had to be pushed on stage to follow Caruso (the old vaudeville saying being \"That's a hard act to follow\" applied here). Then gathering his confidence, he told the crowd, still wowed by Caruso, \"Folks, folks, you ain't heard nothin' yet,\" followed by, \"Now we'll have some music,\" before launching into a short Caruso imitation, all of which got a laugh from the crowd. It took an awful lot of chutzpah to be so bold, but Jolson was evidently up to the task. \"You ain't heard nothin' yet\" became legend, and within a year, the title of a peppy Jolson song.\n\nFrom Ragtime to Jazz\n\nJust prior to the United States' involvement in the European conflict, or the Great War as it was called until the next one came along, a new word was quickly sweeping into the lexicon. Jazz. What started out more or less as small ensemble improvised ragtime, blues and popular song quickly took over much of the music and entertainment world between 1916 and 1917, just about ending the 20-year dominance of ragtime, both in piano rags and songs. It was, however, not so much an invention but an evolution that finally found its mark, first on phonograph records through the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and similar groups, then quickly into sheet music, even if only the word \"jazz\" crept into an Irving Berlin song or two. It has since become much harder to define, since the music called jazz diverged into many sub-species since its origination. But at the time, it was one of those \"If I hear it I'll know what it is\" type of cultural changes.\n\nWhile this was not lost on Broadway in general, that world was also sometimes separated from the rest of the ragtime and popular song world, even though such songs were often interpolated, at times haphazardly, into shows that already had a thin or non-existent plots. Jolson had been riding high on a wave of ragtime-themed or ragtime-styled songs for some time, and even had some hand in writing them. But he and his peers were given a reprise for one more year as the war kept Americans distracted. Ironically, in Europe, the jazz that was played by American musicians there after France was returned to the French caught on fire in that country much more quickly than at home, particularly under the baton of James Reese Europe and his 369th Infantry \"Hell Fighters\" Band. But when Europe and Willie \"The Lion\" Smith and their peers returned to America, it was like 1897 all over again - another wave of what was perceived as a black-originated music style (it was actually a bit more homogenous than that) taking the country.\n\nJolson and the Shuberts had been doing unprecedented business with Sinbad, which had played in four different New York City venues for five stretches during 1918 and 1919, totaling some 404 performances on Broadway alone. As such, the usual tour that followed the New York stint, which was likely extended in part because of the war, was not launched until the spring of 1919, some fourteen months after the opening curtain. The production had changed a bit over time, with new interpolations as mentioned previously, and some tweaking of the Harold Atteridge plot intended to try and make sense of the added material. Al spent much of 1919 and 1920 on the road with Sinbad, coming back to New York now and then to cut some records, do some vaudeville appearances and Sunday concerts, and perhaps rest up a bit. His valuable voice grew weary at times, oftentimes more from alcohol and smoking than from overuse. Yet once he was out on stage he persevered through all of his pain or insecurities in order to gain the love of yet another audience. He also had his imitators and detractors, but most big stars did; he just seemed to have more.\n\nAl also had his troubles, which for celebrities by this time were usually made public, sometimes by the person causing the trouble. In this case, it was Henrietta, who in June of 1919 (some sources claim 1918) filed for divorce from Oakland, California. As reported by the wires in several papers on June 29, 1919, three days after her filing, Henrietta claimed that her husband \"could not stand success…\"\n\n… and that with success his tastes ran strongly to \"wine, race horses and other women,\" Mrs. Henrietta Jolson has on file a suit for divorce. She alleged that Jolson sent her to California from New York last March, declaring \"he loved her better 2,100 miles away.\" \"He tells me I'm only a small-town kid, anyway,\" she said.\n\nMrs. Jolson asks $2,000 a month alimony, declaring the comedian's income is over $3,400 a week. …\n\nNews of his wife's divorce suit today failed to jar Al Jolson from his usual good humor. \"Indeed… it's a surprise to me. Why, I'd intended leaving in a day or so to spend the Summer in California with my wife.\" As to the \"wine, race horses, etc.\" Jolson denied he drank, but said he was fond of race horses.\n\nJolson was not likely headed for Oakland where she was surrounded by her family, and instead spent his summer break resting up in Atlantic City. There were several public efforts by Jolson to reconcile with his wife on trips to Oakland, and even a report as late as June 2, 1920, that they were going to spend the summer together in Hawaii. But Jolson's workload and Henrietta's better senses ended up breaking the deal within a month. The story that she met Al at the Oakland train depot with her new boyfriend might have some validity, and could explain his quick retreat back to New York. George Burns, citing inside information likely heard from Jolson himself, relates that Henrietta actually just wanted to be rid of her husband and was not interested in any financial settlement. According to Burns, it was hard for Al to fathom why a woman would not want to be with him, and demanded she fight for a large settlement. In the end, Henrietta ended up accepting a smaller undisclosed settlement than she might have been able to get, and was granted her divorce in California on July 8, 1920. (Note that the date of June 26, 1919, which is often given, was the initial filing date, not the final date of settlement.)\n\nEven though Jolson was at the top of his game and still riding a crest of nearly untouchable fame, he likely knew, or at least those closest to him did, that he would have to adapt to coming trends to keep relevant. Two of his future rivals, whom he would become friends with—a strained friendship at times—were rising stars with similar life stories. First was Eddie Cantor (1892), who was part of the Ziegfeld family, and capitalizing on Jewish humor as much as he was blackface on the stage. In addition to his sly delivery and clever wry singing style, he had a way with his bulging eyes. In fact, he soon earned the moniker of \"banjo eyes.\" By the 1930s, Eddie would be associated with Jolson in a number of ways. Then there was the upstart, George Jessel (1898), almost 12 years Al's junior, yet becoming better known as an actor each year, having been on stage since he was just a few years old. While he was not quite the singer that Al was, nor did he have as ebullient a personality—Jessel was a bit more dour and serious in his comic roles—he still represented a coming threat to Broadway's reigning comedian. They ran in the same circles, so some interaction and friendly conflict was inevitable. Jolson simply needed to be bigger, and better, and more relevant; more in step with the coming jazz age; at least in theory.\n\nIn front of a crowd, Jolson could be more personable than he was one-to-one. Even when on the road, he kindly acknowledged the tumultuous applause he received each night, having been quoted as saying, \"I am very pleased and flattered with your generosity. It is good to realize that here, though I have not been with you for several years, you remember me and are glad to see me again.\" He also had it in his contract that a percentage of the profits went to other stars in the show, albeit in smaller quantities. But in smaller groups the impression was that Al needed to \"be a man,\" and drink and smoke and swear just as good as any man in the room. He also played a lot of golf and frequented the race tracks, using code with the boys who placed the bets, making sure they knew that whatever amount he asked them to place was actually inflated by 1,000 percent. A $5,000 bet was intended as $50, and so on. This made him sound like he had bravado and money to spare, yet was an apparent overcompensation. But for what? Jolie was on top of the world, and despite his recent divorce, he had everything. Except, perhaps, the youth of Cantor and Jessel. Each of them would literally have the last word in this regard in their own way.\n\nDuring the 1920 political season, Al made a very public choice on who he wanted for president. It was Warren G. Harding or else… or else it was Warren G. Harding. To that end, he wrote a rousing march extolling whatever he could say about Harding, and when Harding, You're the Man for Us was published, the cover claimed it to be \"The Official Republican Campaign Song.\" The lyrics referred to other famous Republicans: \"We think the country's ready for a man like Teddy… We need another Lincoln to do the Nation's Thinking.\" He was also active in making sure that others in his profession voted Republican in November as well. Al even formed the Harding and Coolidge Theatrical League, serving as its president, and running full page ads in the New York Clipper and other papers in order to recruit his peers and underlings. Few could find ridicule in that, and many, even those in opposition, often claimed to admire his bravado in the affair. Harding did win, of course, but Jolson was only a minor factor in the decision. What happened in the Harding administration after that was… well, not Jolson's fault.\n\nAl had otherwise spent much of the year oscillating between Sinbad and vaudeville houses, always keeping busy, cutting only five released sides for Columbia. Three of them were done on separate dates, which was not a common practice for artists who might have done four to eight sides in a matter of one or two days. Perhaps it was the perfectionist streak in him, or just his current focus on a particular tune. This may have been frustrating to Columbia, as it was easier to release a record once two sides had been recorded for it, but he was Jolson, so they managed. Three of them were standouts. In Sweet September had a bit of a Spanish vibe to it, and did well on stage as well. O-Hi-O was a short-term hit for the singer, and he would later hand it off to other artists without having recorded it.\n\nThen there was Avalon, one of Al's favorite songs, interpolated into Sinbad before 1920 was out, but one that ended up making virtually no money for Jolson or his one-time co-writer, Vincent Rose. It remains the most famous song about that mystical island that was owned by gum magnate William Wrigley Jr., and the town that sits on its bay. The original reference was most likely to the mythical island from Le Morte D'Arthur, the first successful novel about the life of the legendary King Arthur. It soon became associated with California's Avalon, which is located on the eastern side of Santa Catalina island, and was quite a hot spot back in the 1920s and 1930s. Beautiful and lyrical all at once, the source of the core of Avalon soon became an item of controversy in the courts. The melody had a relationship with a melody composed by Giacomo Puccini in his opera Tosca. That relationship with the aria E Lucevan le Stella was determined by the courts to be that of near-IDENTITY. In 1921 G. Ricordi, the Italian publisher of Puccini's operas, successfully sued the named composers and the publisher, Jerome H. Remick, for lifting the haunting melody, and was awarded $25,000 in punitive damages as well as all future royalties to the tune. This may have been slightly unfair since the verses were most likely penned by Jolson at or near the time of his recording of the piece in the summer of 1920, and it is the chorus most associated with the aria. Either way, this was a better compromise than removing the piece from circulation, as it was quickly gaining notice.\n\nThe star was getting tired, and as 1920 progressed he had reportedly missed many performances of his shows, although these were often kept from the press. As the main character was in blackface, this was easier to mask the fact that an understudy was doing the role. However, the lack of the usual Jolson concert after the show's final curtain was an obvious tell. So, at the end of the year he got some solid rest in Palm Beach, Florida. Sinbad opened its fourth unprecedented year in Providence, Rhode Island, in February of 1921 with its star back at the helm. It continued throughout the winter and spring, with long stays in San Francisco, Oakland, Chicago and Detroit along the way. Then the company took a break during the summer, with Al dividing time between the varieties, vaudeville, golf and sporting events. By September, it was clear that something new was coming, and even though Sinbad was quite different from when it started, it was becoming hackneyed. The Shuberts knew this, and raised the stakes a bit as their empire grew. Rehearsals for the new property started in September, and the finishing touches were put on another viable Shubert property that would open with the show.\n\nOn October 6, following tryouts in Atlantic City and a couple of other spots, Bombo came to New York's latest entertainment venue, the Al Jolson 59th Street Theater, located upon the site of a former riding academy. The Shuberts thought enough to honor, or perhaps placate, or even motivate, their highest revenue asset, by giving him his own named theater just north of Broadway. He was just far enough off that he did not have to run into crowds from other shows either going or coming, perhaps a way of making his status as a star might shine more brightly. It also gave the Shuberts their own valuable theater back, having freed up the now famous Winter Garden for other purposes, which in this case was to host the last few years of vaudeville in style. There were flowers and accolades and singing, and there was a show, and it did have \"Gus\" as the main foil and wit of the story. The plot was the usual string of dialog intended to wrap around whatever songs were there opening night, soon altered to complement whatever songs Jolson brought in, which were many over the next three years. Arthur Pollock, reviewer for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, gave a spot-on sardonic but encouraging take on the opening:\n\nThe new theater is a large and gorgeous affair and \"Bombo,\" the show with which it was christened, will very likely keep Jolson stamping around in it for a long time. The new show, like the theater, is gorgeous, and two or three of its scenes are also beautiful. There are any number of people in it, but the one who really counts is the blackfaced Al. This lively and lusty fellow has a pungent, robust and virile humor that no one else on the American stage can quite equal. He has an exceedingly keen mind for a joke, any amount of the ability and vitality necessary for putting over his sort of songs, and several other accomplishments. He was the backbone of the show last night and nothing else mattered. He has never been funnier and he is never dull save when he takes it into his head to sing sentimental songs with an attempt to achieve David Warfield's pathos. He is not the exception to the rule that all funny fellows aspire to bring tears to the eyes. Nobody quite knew last night whether his song about April and violets and daffodils [April Showers] was intended to be comic or touching. At any rate, it was neither. But otherwise, Al Jolson was enormously amusing. He has enough vitality and verve to supply motive power for two such entertainments.\n\n\"Bombo\" is much like its predecessors. Harold Atteridge has written the mediocre book and lyrics, while Sigmund Romberg has remembered the music… The show takes its name from that of the blackamoor who acts as servant to no less a person than Christopher Columbus and tells the story of the discovery of America and the incidents that preceded it. It is Bombo, in the person of Jolson, who makes the voyage of discovery possible by putting Queen Isabella and everybody else, including the audience, in good humor… [Jolson] makes it one of the best shows of the Winter Garden type that the Shuberts have presented.\n\nA week later an announcement was made that Harry Jolson had just signed a two-year contract with the B.F. Keith Circuit, starting in Cleveland, Ohio. The article made it clear that being Al Jolson's brother was no picnic and it continued to do him no favors. \"Wherever Harry went it was a case of, 'Well, your brother Al is great,' the inference being that there could be but one great artist in one family.\" It also mentioned, perhaps unkindly, that \"This will place a Jolson on both sides of the present vaudeville fence.\" Other than the ongoing animosity of this type between the siblings, there was virtually no mention of them being in the same place at the same moment.\n\nDespite of the \"mediocre book\" of Bombo, likely a necessary construct to make sure the star could use the songs he wanted, the music—mostly the interpolated material—was right in Jolson's sweet spot. There was one piece in there that spoke of jazz, albeit sung by different characters than \"Gus,\" but much of Jolson's material displayed either his sentimental side, or his bombastic show tune abilities. In short, while it was still fresh material, it was not as fresh of a format for the 1920s. In an effort to combat this, and also to offer room for improvement, Jolson responded to the calls of many aspiring songwriters in November of 1921 by having the occasional amateur night, also noting that he intended to keep a spot open in the show for the occasional new number.\n\nOf the standout pieces found in the original version of Bombo, April Showers is the most memorable, and one that has since been tied directly to Jolie. Composed by Bud De Sylva and Jolson's orchestra leader Louis Silvers, and recorded a couple of weeks after the premiere, this was one of the few pieces in which Jolson used his rich baritone \"cantors voice,\" particularly on the intentionally rubato verse. There is a possibility that he contributed at least some to that verse, without receiving his usual credit. Looking at the original score, and listening to the Columbia recording, one hears a very light and poignant sound applied to the performance. It is also the first time a two-syllable word was stretched to four: \"Whenever April Showers come a-lon-on-ong.\" Nothing else from the original show appears to have been recorded by Al, but a couple of future interpolations became enduring hits. The first was Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goo'bye, another Jolie gem that was interpolated in 1922, to which he applied a hand-whistle chorus, famously captured in The Jazz Singer in 1927. It remained one of his go-to numbers up until his death. The other one, with a similar bent, was California Here I Come, inserted in the fourth season of Bombo. It was both exciting and prophetic, and other than having been famously sung on an episode of I Love Lucy by the cast on their way to the Golden State, it also retained a direct association to Jolie who would soon make California his home. What any of these had to do with the explorations of Christopher Columbus and his faithful servant is unclear, but if Jolson could make it work, and he usually did, then no harm was done.\n\nThen there was the case of at least a couple of songs from that time which were initially endorsed by Jolson by proxy, as his picture was on the cover of the sheet music, but neither recorded or interpolated for any length of time into his shows. Down Yonder was a retread of Waiting for the Robert E. Lee, composed and published by L. Wolfe Gilbert who had written the lyrics for the prior work. The cover claimed it could \"be had on all records and rolls,\" yet disc recordings of this in the early 1920s were rare, and a recording by Jolson was non-existent. Perhaps it had been attempted, then rejected, but Columbia matrix numbers do not reflect this. To be fair, advertising showed Jolson at the top of a list which included Eddie Cantor, Margaret Young, Ruth Roye and many others. Another such work with Jolson's visage was My Buddy by Gus Kahn and Walter Donaldson. A beautiful if schmaltzy waltz tune, it may have been performed by Al a few times, but never committed to disc. The piece became a sentimental favorite in any event, despite the absence of his continuing endorsement.\n\nEven while he was still working through his alleged reconciliation and eventual divorce with Henrietta, Al became acquainted with yet another chorus girl (there had been many). Scranton, Pennsylvania native Alma Osborne was known professionally as Ethel Delmar, a true Broadway beauty, who had previously been a principal in George White's Scandals for both the 1919 and 1920 editions, and who had even enjoyed a run as a Ziegfeld Follies girl before that. Their relationship continued to grow over the next two years. Bombo ended its initial run in New York on April 8, 1922, after which his theater was taken over by The Passing Show of 1922. Al then performed a few high-grossing Sunday night concerts at the Winter Garden Theatre, taking in 50% of the gross for his part. This was followed by a short tour to the West Coast before taking a summer hiatus. During that summer break Jolson and Osborne, who was 22 to his 34, and who had been seen more frequently with Jolson during the year, were married on July 22, and the news was finally confirmed on August 18. Having not been in any shows since 1920, it is probable that her career was set aside to attend to her more famous Broadway beau.\n\nIn the fall, it was back to traveling, as Bombo went on its national tour, starting at the Apollo Theater in Chicago in October. The goal was to bring Jolie to the people since they could not all make the journey to New York to see Jolie. Just before leaving, he recorded a couple of new tracks for Columbia, including Toot, Toot, Tootsie, with an energetic and slightly overbearing orchestra. It would soon be a best seller. Ethel tagged along for the tour, but almost immediately she learned that while there may have been a lot of Al to go around, not a lot of it was available to his new wife. It was reportedly not too far into the marriage where the former star who had a potential career was now starting to drown her sorrows with alcohol on many lonely nights. This was a bit more of a challenge in some places during National Prohibition, but it was clear that those running in theater circles had access, especially in Chicago. During his run of Bombo in the Windy City, it was reported that Jolson was pulling in as much as $35,000 per week. Some of the imitators of his style, usually not playing in the same city if they had any sense, were also doing pretty good business, but nowhere near that amount.\n\nJolson was approached in 1922 by playwright and screenwriter Anthony Paul Kelly, who wanted the star to be in a film scenario he was writing, one that was to be brought to the screen director and producer David Wark Griffith. It was planned to involve both synchronized and unsynchronized sound in a recorded track, which Griffith had done with the expensive and failed project Dream Street in 1921. The tentative title was reported as either Black and White or The Clown [while the title Mammy's Boy has been cited, no period sources were found with that reference]. It had Al playing a private detective who uses a blackface disguise to investigate a crime and help save another man from execution. The scenario for the dodgy plot, which involved a not-so-subtle look at perceptions of race, was initially approved by Jolson as it progressed. Griffith, who had also engaged a group of screen actors from Los Angeles for the filming at his Mamaroneck, New York, studio, just north of the city, noted that he was investing some $500,000 in the project, a move emboldened by his procuring such a big star.\n\nAfter a heavy season of travel interrupted by a few trips home and some recording, and no doubt a few rounds of golf and other diversions, Jolson ended the second season of Bombo following the tour with a short run at the Winter Garden starting May 14. Then after closing two weeks later, and with only a couple of days of rest, he immediately reported to the Griffith studios to learn how to be a film actor. Kelly, who had evidently done some of the legwork, also had a stake in the project, reportedly in for a piece of Jolson's contract. There was conflict from the start of the production. Jolson did not take well to being taught how to act again, this time without his voice, a precious asset. He also did not enjoy the restrictions, supervisions, or working outside with heavy makeup on in the warm June sun. It is not entirely clear what happened at the end of two weeks of rehearsal and a few takes in front of the camera, as both sides put spin on what happened next, but there are two valid theories. First, here is an excerpt of the report in the June 23, 1923, issue of Variety, printed six days after the incident of June 17:\n\nAl Jolson and his \"wa"
