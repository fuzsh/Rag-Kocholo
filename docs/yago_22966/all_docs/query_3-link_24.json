        "text": "Fans at baseball games across America have been singing the same song during the seventh-inning stretch for decades. If you're in the stands, nothing beats the fun of belting out that tune everyone knows, \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame!\" The song was penned in 1908 by 29-year-old Jack Norworth, a Tin Pan Alley songwriter who, by his own account, had never been to a baseball game. On a New York subway train, he spotted a sign announcing: \"Baseball Today—Polo Grounds.\" He then sketched out two verses about a girl named Katie Casey who had \"baseball fever,\" plus the chorus we sing today.\n\nWhen her beau asked her to see a show, Katie answered, \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame!\" Lyrics in hand, Norworth asked his friend Albert Von Tilzer to write a melody; Norworth's wife, Nora Bayers, sang it on vaudeville. That same year, singer Edward Meeker recorded it for Edison Records. [See original lyrics at the bottom of post.]\n\nEarly movie theaters featured it during intermissions, with lyrics on the screen encouraging the audience to sing the chorus about where Katie wants to go. \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" became a pop hit!\n\nJust when the song made it to a baseball game is not certain. But it remained hugely popular through the decades. It has inspired multiple versions and recordings and a 1949 feature film of the same name starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly.\n\nIn 1958, Major League Baseball awarded Jack Norworth a gold lifetime ballpark pass. In 2001, the Recording Industry of America ranked \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" as No. 8 in its Songs of the Century list.\n\nWhile Jack Norworth wrote over 2,500 songs (including \"Shine on Harvest Moon\"), it was this little story about a girl and her love of the game—scribbled on a scrap of paper (now in the National Baseball Hall of Fame)—that turned into what's been called \"baseball's national anthem.\"\n\nToday, the song is sung almost as often as Happy Birthday, at least at the ballpark during the seventh-inning stretch.\n\nWatch Yannick Nézet-Séguin lead the crowd in \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" with the Phillie Phanatic in 2010!\n\n12 Fun Facts about \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\"?\n\nComposed in 1908 by 29-year-old Tin Pan Alley songwriter Jack Norworth, born in 1879.?\n\nJack had never been to a professional baseball game.?\n\nHe gave it to his friend Albert von Tilzer, who had also never been to a baseball game.?\n\nIt was a story about Katie Casey, who had baseball fever; when her beau asked her to go to a show, she said, “Take me out to the ballgame!”\n\nIt was recorded in 1908 by Edward Meeker for the Edison Phonograph Company.?\n\nEarly movie theaters played it during intermission, with lyrics encouraging the audience to sing along with Katie, ‘Take me out to the Ballgame.’?\n\nIn 1927, Norworth wrote a second version, changing the name of the girl to Nelly Kelly; the chorus stayed the same.?\n\nCracker Jack was a new product in 1893, but sales soared after it was mentioned in the song.?\n\n\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" was honored with a U.S. postage stamp in 2008.?\n\nJack Norworth composed over 2,500 songs, including \"Shine on Harvest Moon.\"?\n\nNorworth went to his first professional baseball game in 1940.\n\nNorworth, who died in 1959, was given a gold lifetime park pass in 1958 by Major League Baseball.?\n\nOriginal Lyrics:\n\nKatie Casey was baseball mad\n\nHad the fever and had it bad.\n\nJust to root for the home town crew,\n\nEv'ry sou* Katie blew.\n\nOn a Saturday, her young beau\n\nCalled to see if she'd like to go\n\nTo see a show but Miss Kate said,\n\n\"No, I'll tell you what you can do.\"\n\nTake me out to the ball game,\n\nTake me out with the crowd\n\nBuy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,\n\nI don't care if I never get back\n\nLet me root, root, root for the home team,\n\nIf they don't win it's a shame\n\nFor it's one, two, three strikes, you're out\n\nAt the old ball game."
