        "text": "The song “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” is 100 years old this year. The words were by Jack Norworth, a Philadelphia native. Much has been written about the anniversary, but mostly the same old stories: that Norworth wrote the song on a New York subway after seeing a poster for a Giants game, and that he had never seen a baseball game and didn’t attend one until 1940.I didn’t read anything that looked deeper into Norworth’s life. Maybe it’s just as well, because some accounts claim that he was a long-time Giants fan, but pretended that he never saw a game because it was a good publicity yarn.\n\nResearching Norworth’s life turns up many such inconsistencies. When facts collide, historians must reach conclusions. Amateurs like me can jump to conclusions. After leaping among the discrepancies, here is what I conclude about Jack Norworth.\n\nHe was born in Philadelphia in 1879. His name was John Godfrey Knauff. His great-grandfather, Henry (possibly Heinrich) Knauff, was a Hessian mercenary with the British army during the Revolution, who stayed in America and became a pipe organ builder\n\nNorworth’s grandfather, Henry W. Knauff, joined the firm. An 1867 advertisement shows H. Knauff & Son, established 1834, at 649 N. Broad St., offering “church organs of every description and size.” Henry, and son Henry W., lived at 1613 Wallace St..\n\nHenry W’s son, Theodore Christian Knauff, was Norworth’s father. He was running the business by 1876, when a catalogue of the Centennial Exhibition listed a display of miniature organs by T. C. Knauff. He was active in civic affairs, and was on the board of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art); he wrote a history of the school in 1923.\n\nYoung Jack learned to handle a keyboard, and sang in a church choir (probably St. Mark’s Episcopal Church at 17th and Locust Sts.) but at about age 14, became a merchant seaman. He sailed the world until he was 20, then came to New York and worked in vaudeville.\n\nThere, he met Leonora Goldberg, a pretty singer his age from Joliet, Illinois, whose stage name was Nora Bayes. They were married in about 1907. (It seems to have been the fourth marriage out of five for both of them.) They toured in vaudeville, billed as “Nora Bayes, assisted and admired by Jack Norworth.”\n\nIn 1908, Florenz Ziegfeld signed the couple to appear in his Follies on Broadway. They performed a song that they wrote (though someone else claimed authorship) called “Shine On, Harvest Moon.” It was the big hit song of 1908, and they were a romanticized celebrity couple. Jack’s “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” was also popular.\n\nJack and Nora were divorced in 1913. He continued writing songs. Nora stayed on Broadway. While appearing in the Cohan Review of 1917, she introduced George M. Cohan’s war song, “Over There.”\n\nNora died during cancer surgery in 1928. Jack died in 1959, at age 80. People who reckon such things say that only “The Star Spangled Banner” and “Happy Birthday to You” are sung more often in the U. S. than “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.”"
