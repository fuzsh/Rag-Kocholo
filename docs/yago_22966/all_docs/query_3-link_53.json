        "text": "Description\n\nAmerican performer and songwriter (1879-1959) best known for co-writing such standards as the baseball anthem, ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game,’ and ‘Shine On, Harvest Moon.’ Desirable typed copy of the song ‘Shine on Harvest Moon,’ one page, 7.25 x 10.5, signed at the conclusion in fountain pen by Jack Norworth. The song, in part: “The night was mighty dark and you could hardly see / For the moon refused to shine, / Couple sitting underneath a willow tree / For love they pine, / Little maid was kind afraid of darkness / So she said ‘We better go,’ / Boy began to sigh, looked up in the sky / Told the moon his little tale of woe / Oh, shine on, shine on, Harvest moon, up in the sky.” In fine condition, with faint toning to the top edge.\n\nCredited to the married vaudeville team Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth, 'Shine On, Harvest Moon is a popular early-1900s song that was one of a series of moon-related Tin Pan Alley songs of the era. Debuted by Bayes and Norworth in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1908 to great acclaim, the song became a pop standard and continues to be performed and recorded in the 21st century.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts\n\nDates: #643 - Ended September 14, 2022\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by PSA/DNA\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $100.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
