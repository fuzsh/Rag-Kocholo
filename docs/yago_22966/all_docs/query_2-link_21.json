        "text": "Autobiography\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nthe vaudevillian...typified the spirit of liberty.Â Was he not utterly free?Â He travelled across the expanses of the great land, and did as he wished on the stage.Â In the most mobile of all nations, that nationâs most mobile citizen, the vaudevillian, represented something special.Â Vaudeville entertained the family, the sacred core of\n\nAmerica\n\nâs strength.Â Yet the nation had been founded by daring adventurers who challenged the unknown.Â The average American had to remain close to home, but not the vaudevillian.Â He was heroic in this sense, meeting the challenges of one town after another, one audience after another, his very career at stake each time he mounted the stage.Â The theatergoer could share in all this.Â The destiny of the lone figure on stage was in his hands.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n...at a distance life awoke, and there was a rattle of lean wheels, a slow clangor of shod hoofs.Â And he heard the whistle wail along the river.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Yet, as he stood for the last time by the angels of his father's porch, it seemed as if the Square already were far and lost; or, I should say, he was like a man who stands upon a hill above the town he has left, yet does not say \"The town is near,\" but turns his eyes upon the distant soaring ranges.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Thomas Wolfe, Look Homeward, Angel\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â What correspondence is is not known at the present day, for several reasons, the chief of which is that man has withdrawn himself from heaven by the love of self and love of the world...This was not so with the ancient people.Â To them the knowledge of correspondences was the chief of knowledges.Â By means of it they acquired intelligence and wisdom; and by means of it those who were of the church had communication with heaven; for the knowledge of correspondences is angelic knowledge.Â The most ancient people, who were celestial men, thought from correspondence itself, as the angels do.Â Therefore they talked with angels, and frequently saw the Lord and were taught by Him.Â But at this day that knowledge has been so completely lost that no one knows what correspondence is.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Emanuel Swedenborg, Heaven and Its Wonders\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â and Hell (1758)\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Poetry does not arise out of a part of one's life.Â It permeates everything, welcomes everything.Â When Ivan was just beginning to write his great epic poem, Pantograph, he phoned me to talk about it.Â \"No more inhibitions!\" he said triumphantly.Â I remember as well the title of Larry Eignerâs first mature book: From the Sustaining Air.Â The âairsâ a poet puts on sustain him in innumerable ways.Â These are some lines from a recent piece:\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nThe drowned day\n\nany man of vigorous mind\n\nanticipate his thought\n\nwhich all ranks pay\n\nI cannot even hear of Vigor of any kind\n\nbread and fire\n\nI know not\n\nlyre\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Lyre/liar. The thrust of so much current writing involves a redefinition of selfhood.Â In a little paper on âHamletâs âIndividualityââ I argued that the supposed âindividualityâ of Shakespeareâs character was in fact âmultiplicity.âÂ One might say the same thing of the figure which emerges from autobiography:\n\nÂ\n\nHamlet seems real not because he is a coherent character or âselfâ or because there is some discoverable âessenceâ to him but because he actively and amazingly inhabits so many diverse, interconnecting, potentially contradictory contexts.Â Implicitly promising to tell us all about the interesting âindividualâ Hamlet, the play Hamlet ends by expressing the possibility that âindividualityâ (a word derived from the Latin individuus, indivisible) is in fact multiplicity.Â It is not his separateness but the plenitude of contexts in which Hamlet functionsâi.e., his multiplicityâthat gives him density, renders him vivid.\n\nÂ\n\n*\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We're supposed to be these unities.Â And we're not.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jess, in conversation\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I was born.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4/13/96\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nPOST SCRIPT, 2010\n\nÂ\n\nOn June 5, 2010, I received the Lifetime Achievement Award from The Berkeley Poetry Festival. As part of that award, June 5, 2010 was designated âJack Foley Dayâ in\n\nBerkeley\n\n, a day on which the citizens of\n\nBerkeley\n\nwere asked âto reflect upon and honor the lifetime achievements of Jack Foley and the impact he has left upon the City of\n\nBerkeley\n\n.â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I wrote this:\n\nÂ\n\nIt was a beautiful day in\n\nBerkeley\n\nin all senses! Adelle and I had a wonderful time, and so many diverse voices (and âbackgroundâ sounds!) were heard that I can scarcely number them all. I was particularly touched by tributes from dear friends like Ivan ArgÃ¼elles, Mary-Marcia Casoly, Katherine Hastings and Lucille Lang Day. And among the dear friends in the audience were the wonderful poets Michael McClure, Al Young, and Neeli Cherkovski, the great artist Leonard Bregerâsource of my Facebook imageâJoyce Jenkins of Poetry Flash as well as our amazing son Sean, who came all the way from Tennessee to be present. Of course the people who weren't thereâdear friends too, people like Jake Berry and Chris Mansel and Mary Ann Sullivan and othersâwere there as well. Though my technical know-how is limited, Iâll try to post some photos. And the entire event is YouTube bound. In the meantime, here are some words from yesterday.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This was my acceptance speech:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This award honors my wife Adelle as much as it honors me. She was there for all the Whereasâs.\n\nâThe world is all that is the case.â âThought can be of what is not the case.\"\n\n(Wittgenstein: Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, published 1921; Philosophical Investigations, published 1952)\n\nThey say that every dog has its day. This is definitely mine. The great kindness of Louis Cuneo and the Festival and the wonderful city of\n\nBerkeley\n\nhas placed my usually-maintained cynicism in disarray. Louis Cuneoâs Motherâs Hen Press published my first book in 1987. And now this. I feel much in tune, and with good reason, with a place nicknamed âBezerkley.â Did\n\nGloucester\n\never have a Charles Olson Day? I remember, years ago, during the âtroubles,â riding a bus to the UC campus. The driver looked at all the well-clothed, well-scrubbed, beautiful young men and women carrying protest signs and was utterly amazed. There they were like young gods and goddesses in\n\nCalifornia\n\nâs perfect weather. What could there possibly be to protest? I knew, of course, but for him these people were in heaven. Today, I feel a bit like Iâm in heaven, too. Imagine: âJack Foley Day.â Jack Foley dazed. Of courseâas everyone knowsâwhatever I have âachievedâ would have been utterly impossible without the support, encouragement, good humor and loving criticism of my wifeâand performance partnerâAdelle. Couldnât have done it withoutcha. And without the support and interest of the wonderful community of poets in this highly poetic areaâOz in pentameter. Thank you all.\n\nAnd this was the last poem I read as part of my presentation:\n\nÂ\n\nLINES\n\nÂ\n\nwhat was the purpose\n\nif purpose there was?\n\nwhy all this fury?\n\ndid you hope to change\n\nthe perceptions\n\nof people at large?\n\nYes, foolishlyâ¦\n\ndid you believe\n\nthat anything you said\n\ncould affect the immense\n\nmisconception\n\npeople call ârealityââquelle erreur!\n\nYes, it was a mistakeâ¦\n\nso what did it do?\n\ndid you teach anyone\n\nanything?\n\nNo\n\nwere you able to change\n\nthe nature of poetry\n\neven in the smallest\n\nway?\n\nNo\n\nso what reveals itself,\n\nadmirable author,\n\nat this difficult point\n\nof your being?\n\nNothing:\n\nJâaime les nuages, les nuages qui passentâ¦\n\nI love the passing\n\nclouds\n\nAs for poetry:\n\nÃ§a mâa donnÃ© quelque chose Ã faireâ¦\n\nIt gave me something to doâ¦\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nÂ\n\nFor me, writing is a joy, even a ârefuge,â not a struggle. Perhaps an addiction. I think sometimes that my happiest moments are when Iâm writing. At the same time, I donât think thereâs much hope that my writing will survive my death. Iâve written no Waste Land, no Howl, no Coney Island of the Mindânothing that would thrust me into the consciousness of the literati. I had hoped that my choruses would do that, but they didnâtâpartly because poetry as silent reading is imbedded so thoroughly in the consciousness of the âliteratiâ and partly because, though my work is passionately âspoken,â I am no spoken word poet affirming his ego by declamation. I suppose that, coming to the conviction that the work will not last, many people would stop. Why bother? Yet the joy is such that you continueânot in the illusory hope that you will âlastâ but simply for the pleasure of it. The knowledge of your death and of no more eating doesnât prevent you from enjoying a good meal now. The immediate response of people at a reading is also a help. You have touched somebody even if your work, like most work, will vanish.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ"
