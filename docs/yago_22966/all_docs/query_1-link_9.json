Via the vaudeville theater she came to the Broadway where she managed her breakthrough.\n\nBut her greatest fame she achieved with her appearances in movies. She made her film debut in 1922 with \"The Glory of Clementina\" (22) and it followed other well-known silent movies like \"The Fog\" (23), \"Salomy Jane\" (23), \"The Next Corner\" (24), \"The City That Never Sleeps\" (24), \"The Eagle\" (25), \"The Goose Woman\" (25), \"Fifth Avenue\" (26), \"The Blind Goddess\" (26), \"Mr. Wu\" (27), \"The Garden of Eden\" (28) and \"Not Quite Decent\" (29).\n\nShe continued her impressive career in the 30's and aroused enthusiasm by her roles in \"The Three Sisters\" (30), \"Caught\" (31), \"State Fair\" (33), \"Doctor Bull\" (33), \"David Harum\" (34), \"The Scarlet Empress\" (34), \"The County Chairman\" (35) and \"Maid of Salem\" (37), her last movie.\n\nTo her greatest success belongs an Oscar nomination in 1929 for \"A Ship Comes In\" (28) - it was the first Academy Award in film history.\n\nLouise Dresser was married in second marriage with the composer Jack Norworth."
