        "text": "How would you fight against the restrictions that stifled your every move? This is the challenge Nora Bayes faced, one of the first mega-celebrities whose life mirrored her troubled career. There was no question of her talent but her attempts to command respect from others backfired. She tested the limits of a woman’s power in the early 20th century all as her fame soared. But is this life the life she really wanted? This is the story of how one vaudeville star’s unconventional and flamboyant take on the challenges of her day questioned the traditional roles of women in a time of social turmoil and newfound power…\n\nSinging to Flee the Orthodox Life\n\nRachel Eleanora Sarah Goldberg, or Nora Bayes to you and me, was born on October 3rd, 1880 in Chicago, Illinois. Growing up in a strict, Orthodox Jewish household prevented Nora from doing just about anything other than obeying the Bible and getting married. That’s not to say, however, that she didn’t have dreams.\n\nNora loved to sing and she received some vocal training from the celebrated musician William Tomlins. According to Nora, William wanted to send her abroad to study but of course, Nora was 13 and her parents had big plans for her…\n\nNo, Nora! Just think of all those children you must have!\n\nLike any 13-year-old girl, Nora sighed and wondered if she should accept her fate. You can picture her now, staring out of her bedroom window, miserable and just wanting to sing. But Nora wasn’t going to sit around forever.\n\nShe was an independent thinker, even at such a young age. She wanted to become an actress, one who sang to the adoring crowds cheering her on. But her parents told her:\n\n“The theatre and all its works represented the lowest form of damnation and mortal sin.”\n\nI mean, considering what was about to happen, they weren’t far off. Nora wanted… well, she wanted to do SOMETHING. Something to get away from that family. Ironically, her salvation came from within that very family.\n\nGetting married gave Nora the freedom to escape her restrained life and follow those dreams of hers. Not many people would find their salvation in the loving embrace of a part-time undertaker and jack-of-all-trades, but that said, Nora wasn’t most people…\n\nA Rising Star Finding Her Audience\n\nLike many actresses, Nora loved to embellish. She later wrote of her marriage at just 17 to Otto Gressing, a proud undertaker, but in truth, she was 19 and he wasn’t a very good undertaker. In fact, he partook in many pursuits. Just about whatever he could really, to pay the bills. One of his biggest earners was travelling door to door selling… well, what d’ya got?\n\nIt’s not clear what Nora’s parents made of all this. But we know her parents were running a jewellery business in LA by 1904 and, with Nora living on the East Coast, it’s likely they rarely crossed paths.\n\nNora adopted her stage name, Nora Bayes, around this time. She wanted ‘Dora Goldberg’, but her Jewish manager informed her that, with a Jewish name, she had no chance for success. But she wasn’t some struggling actress finding it hard to make it.\n\nShe was damn good. She could act and sing, plus her comedic timing was second to none. She lived near Chicago so she was close enough to engage in many amateur theatre nights. She loved it, being up there on stage. Her favourite venue was the Hopkins Theater on the South Side, a vaudeville house.\n\nTickets cost just 10 cents. So many of Chicago’s poorer residents could afford to go. But they weren’t getting a bum night. The small crowds loved to see Nora singing and pratfalls, deliberate of course, growing more and more confident each night.\n\nNora’s work in Chicago got her noticed by Helen Cohan, mother of American entertainer George Cohan. With Helen’s help, Nora hit the road with a stock company, taking Otto with her, not that he had much say in it…\n\nNora travelled to St. Louis and then on to San Francisco in 1900. There Nora was able to refine her act but she knew that to make it in vaudeville, she had to break New York City.\n\nAnd so, in 1901, the couple moved to Manhattan. But would it work out for Nora?\n\nThe Mega Star of the Follies\n\nNora’s star soared. She had a hit in 1902 with ‘Down where the Wurzburger Flowers’, a song written by Harry von Tilzer. Audiences loved Nora’s song. Sometimes Harry was in the audience and he’d stand up and sing it with Nora. Soon, she was playing at a few of the better vaudeville houses in the city…\n\nShe rapidly became known as a capable comic actress and songstress. Her fame spread so quickly that, by early 1904, she was a regular at Hammerstein’s Vaudeville Theatre in Manhattan. One of her performances was once described as:\n\n‘Bewitchingly pretty… [Nora] had a voice that will captivate the crowd.’\n\nIn 1905, she opened The Palace Theatre in London. Never mind America, the British went crazy for Nora. I mean, have you seen that theatre? It’s a big one. She became a regular on circuits all over Britain and America. Now in the public eye more often, however, Nora was prone to far more scrutiny than ever before.\n\nShe soon learnt that there were some things she could not get away with. With the media all over her, her marriage started to suffer and, in 1907, she divorced Otto. Shortly after, Florenz Ziegfeld approached her about a show he was planning to launch.\n\nHe wanted Nora to take part but this was the biggest thing she’d ever been in. There was much excitement and plenty of press. Nora’s involvement with The Ziegfeld Follies cemented her fame in showbusiness.\n\nFewer than nine years after she left her stifling home life, Nora was now in the top five highest-earning female performers… ON EARTH. She was propelled to a level of stardom that is hard to fathom today. She really was one of the first mega-celebrities.\n\nAnd with this came new romances…\n\nThe Ego of the Marvellously Difficult Performer\n\nEnjoying great success in the theatre biz introduced Nora to many people, including singer and dancer Jack Norworth. It’s said they wrote a song together, ‘Shine On, Harvest Moon’ although the authorship of this song is still contested. They were soon married, although this marriage, much like her marriage with Otto, was strained.\n\nOh, they worked well together on stage but Jack was fiercely jealous of Nora. She commanded far higher salaries than he did and she treated him more as a servant than a husband. He, in turn, flirted with other women. Nora was growing more confident.\n\nShe became flamboyant, as do many stars when the fame gets to them. She challenged the authority of theatre managers and producers and became somewhat difficult to be around. Although it’s important to stress just how famous she was. I mean, I’d also be stressed if I was her…\n\nThe media was all over Nora and Jack. Every newspaper in America was fascinated by every facet of their lives. Even when Nora got a new haircut, it made the newspapers. Women started to emulate her hair and fashion styles. Many of them admired her fiercely independent streak, but it often backfired on Nora.\n\nOnce she walked out of a show for The Ziegfeld Follies. Florenz successfully sued Nora for breach of contract. But the public lapped it up. They loved her renegade ways. Women rarely acted like this in public back then. She had, if anything, more in common with modern stars…\n\nBy 1910, she commanded a salary of $2,500 a week. In today’s money, that’s nearly $5 million a year. And in her day, that kind of money went a hell of a long way. There was something about Nora, something that captivated the audiences. She infused humour into her act, along with self-deprecation about her failed marriages. Her tone and range were lauded. Her ability to sell her performances won her acclaim.\n\nThere was no doubt. By 1910, Nora Bayes was the biggest female performer in America. And still, she wasn’t even 30 yet. But such fame often comes at a price. Nora’s ego was threatening to derail her career…\n\nCollapsing Under the Weight of Stardom\n\nIn 1912, one performance of a play by Nora and Jack ran for just 64 performances, appearing to collapse under the weight of Nora’s ego. They tried again with another play, but this one ended after just 60 performances. In 1913, the travelling company Nora and Jack were travelling with folded due to poor reviews.\n\nThe public wasn’t aware of any of this drama. Nora was damn good at putting on a brave face. But Nora and Jack were no longer the happy couple they once were. They divorced in 1913. Not only was the public shocked, but they were even more shocked when, just one month later, Nora married Jack’s understudy, Harry Prince.\n\nNora hardly cared about such dramas. She was a star of vaudeville. Seemingly, she could survive anything. By 1914, she was running advertisements for her shows with the tagline, ‘The World’s Greatest Singing Single Comedienne’. I told you she had an ego…\n\nNora’s marriage to Harry ended in 1915. She went back to Broadway in ‘Maid in America’, for which she contributed some of the music. But the strain of being on the road and so many failed relationships started to take its toll on her.\n\nIn 1916, exhausted, Nora had a slip in concentration and suffered an accident on stage. She had to take a break but that wasn’t the worst thing for her. She was back on stage in 1917 for the Broadway revue, ‘Odds and Ends’, which ran for 117 performances. Which also starred Jack Norworth. Now, where have I heard that name before?\n\nIt was Nora and Jack’s last public appearance together. The public was devastated that there was no rekindling of the romance. They were superstars and gorgeous. The public wanted them to be together! But it wasn’t to be.\n\nNora had become more temperamental and demanding. But she drew huge crowds so producers tolerated her behaviour. Well, most of the time. She charmed others with her wit. For example, she’d sign letters with, ‘Your Loving Son’, which became something of an industry inside joke…\n\nIn case you’re wondering, Nora married for a fourth time in 1920. This time to Aaron Gordon. This also didn’t end too well. They adopted four children before the marriage collapsed in 1922. But Nora perhaps had bigger problems. Or at least in her eyes.\n\nWas her bubble about to burst?\n\nNora’s Last Bow\n\nNora appeared in three more shows between 1920 and 1922, but with each new show, the audience got smaller and smaller. Her popularity was starting to wane. But this was just in Manhattan. In places such as Washington, a favourite haunt of Nora’s, her allure still seemed to draw in the numbers.\n\nBut Washington was an anomaly. Bookings continued to decrease as Nora stubbornly refused to update her act. It now seemed old-fashioned and out of tune with the latest trends.\n\nNora married again in 1925, this time to pianist Louis Alter. The couple travelled quite a bit but Nora grew increasingly unwell. She struggled to keep up with her engagements and by the mid-1920s, she was suffering from stomach cancer.\n\nThe cancer took a brutal toll on Nora. By 1927, she’d lost nearly six stone in weight or around 37 kilograms. But Nora kept her illness a secret from the public. She still had her fans out there. She endeavoured to beat her illness, even taking up the practice of Christian Science. She still did everything she could to appear in public as much as possible.\n\nThere were a few charity gigs and radio show appearances in the late 1920s. But a benefit held for the National Vaudeville Association at the Palace Theater was a disaster. Nora got into a heated argument with the management over Sophie Tucker, a singer, about who should go on stage first.\n\nNora lost the argument and her spot on the show. It’s said she was escorted out of the side door, much to her humiliation. In 1928, she admitted herself into the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn for a ‘much-needed rest’.\n\nDoctors did everything they could to ease her pain and help her however they could, but it was too late for Nora. She underwent abdominal surgery but only a few days later, on March 19th, she died at the tragically young age of just 47.\n\nHer storied career and life had come to a devastating end. She left behind her adopted children, her five husbands and so many tens of thousands of heartbroken fans.\n\nThere really was only one Nora Bayes.\n\nThe Vaudevillian Star of the Golden Age of Broadway\n\nHow would you fight against the restrictions that stifled your every move? This is the challenge Nora Bayes faced, one of the first mega-celebrities whose life mirrored her troubled career. She made her name with the Ziegfeld Follies, becoming one of the most popular vaudevillian and Broadway stars of her age.\n\nThere was no question of her talent but she commanded respect from others, but it often backfired. Her life was tumultuous and she paid the price of mega-fame. She demonstrated the limits of a woman’s power in the early 20th century, all as her fame soared. But was it the life she really wanted?\n\nPerhaps it was. All she wanted was to escape her stifling home life and that’s just what she did. At one point, she commanded one of the highest salaries of any female performer and, in 1922, she became the first woman to have a Broadway theatre named after her. Although it was demolished in 1945 but what else is new…\n\nSome say she leased the theatre herself and named it after herself, but we can’t prove this. But it does sound like something she’d do. It demonstrates her flamboyant and unconventional take on the challenges of her day. She threw herself, quite spectacularly, at fame and fortune, amassing an adoring legion of fans. But her stubborn resistance to change ultimately led to her downfall.\n\nStill, without evening trying to, she questioned the traditional roles of women in a time of great social turmoil and newfound power for women. By the time of her untimely death, Nora had sown the seeds for the power the mega-celebrities to come would wield and showed the way for how to resist the stifling restrictions we may face…\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost RO: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nMy Other Blogs: The Indelible Life of Me | To Contrive & Jive"
