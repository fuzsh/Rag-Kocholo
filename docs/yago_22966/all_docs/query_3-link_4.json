        "text": "Jack Norworth (5 January 1879 - 1 September 1959) was a U.S. songwriter, singer and vaudeville performer. With his wife, Nora Bayes, he wrote many of the classic songs of the early 20th century, including \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\" and \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".\n\nNorworth was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on January 5, 1879. In his early career, Norworth first appeared on stage in vaudeville acts as a blackface comedian and later appeared in Broadway musicals including The Great White Way, Ziegfeld Follies of 1909, The Jolly Bachelors, Little Miss Fix-It, Roly-Poly and Odds and Ends.\n\nNorworth is credited as co-writer of a number of Tin Pan Alley hits. He wrote the lyrics of the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (music by Albert Von Tilzer) in 1908, his most long lasting hit. But it wasn't until 1940 that he actually witnessed a Major League Baseball game. The song placed at number 8 on the \"Songs of the Century\" list selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America.[1]\n\nIn 1908, Jack Norworth wrote the lyrics to “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” while riding a New York City subway train. He had spotted a sign that said \"Ballgame Today at the Polo Grounds\" and baseball-related lyrics started popping into his head. He took the lyrics to composer Albert Von Tilzer and the product was to become the well known baseball song. Ironically, neither Norworth or Tilzer had ever been to a baseball game at the time the song was written, but it became the second most widely sung song in America (second only to the National Anthem) and a #1 hit in 1908 for Billy Murray and Haydn Quartet.\n\nHis \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\" was an even bigger hit at the time. There is some disagreement about Norworth's involvement in the latter. Broadway historian John Kenrick credits Edward Madden and Gus Edwards, while the family of Follies songwriter Dave Stamper claims he wrote the song while working as pianist for Nora Bayes, who is the officially credited co-writer with Norworth. Another possibility for the music could lie with George Gershwin, who was also a piano player for this vaudeville troupe. Albert Koch, of Wisconsin, also an accomplished songwriter, claims to have written the song himself, and sold it outright for $50, forfeiting the rights to the song.\n\nHighlights from the Other popular songs credited to Jack Norworth include \"Back to My Old Home Town\"; \"Come Along, My Mandy\"; \"Dear Dolly\"; \"Good Evening, Caroline\"; \"Holding Hands\"; \"Honey Boy\"; \"I'm Glad I'm a Boy/I'm Glad I'm a Girl\"; \"I'm Glad I'm Married\"; \"Kitty\"; \"Meet Me in Apple Blossom Time\"; “O How He Could Sing an Irish Song”, \"Over on the Jersey Side\"; \"Since My Mother Was a Girl\"; \"Sing an Irish Song\" and \"Smarty.\" \"Turn Off Your Light, Mr. Moon Man\" is a sequel to \"Shine on, Harvest Moon.\" and “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” (written by Albert Von Tilzer)\n\nTouring throughout the US, Norworth was most notably known as an actor and singer, performing mainly with his wife Nora Bayes. However, he also wrote several songs intended for vaudeville shows such as Little Miss Fix-It, The Jolly Bachelors, and Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nBorn John Godfrey Knauff in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Theodore Christian Knauff and Louisa H. (Pearson) Knauff, he changed his name to Jack Norworth when he went into show business. His father was an organ builder and also a choir director at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The theater was not a reputable career in that time especially coming from a religious family. Following a few years at sea, he landed in New York City at age 20 to embark on a show business career. In 1908 he married Nora Bayes, with whom he performed in vaudeville; the couple divorced in 1913.Following the Ziegfeld Follies (1909), Norworth appeared in a number of Broadway theater productions and was heard on early radio, such as his March 1928 guest appearance on Acousticon Hour.\n\nAfter Bayes, he was married to actress Louise Dresser. He appeared in early sound films with his third wife, Dorothy Adelphi. He was portrayed by Dennis Morgan in the 1944 musical film Shine On, Harvest Moon (in which Ann Sheridan played Bayes as the love of Norworth's life) and by Ron Husmann in the 1978 Ziegfeld biopic Ziegfeld: The Man & His Women. He is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nJack Norworth died of a heart attack in Laguna Beach, California and is interred at Melrose Abbey Memorial Park in Anaheim, California, just across I-5 from the Los Angeles Angels ballpark. On July 11, 2010, a 3-foot-tall (0.91 m) black granite monument, paid for by concerned fans, was installed about 100 feet from Jack's actual headstone\n\nHe appeared in the films, \"The Southerner\" (1945), \"Season's Greetings\" (1931), \"Odds and Ends with Mr. & Mrs. Jack Norworth\" (1929), and \"The Crooked Dagger\" (1919). He composed the songs. \"The Naughty Nineties\" (1945), \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\" (1944), \"Knee Deep In Music\" (1933), \"California Weather\" (1933), \"Along Came Ruth\" (1933), and \"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\".\n\nHe a Life Member of the Parent Assembly of the Society of American Magicians in New York City, with Membership No. 405. Norworth was a cousin of magician Sedrick Hoyt (Earle G. Heyl, the father of Edgar Heyl).[2]\n\nWith wife Nora Bayes, starred in stage shows and co-wrote songs. Most famous composition is \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\".\n\nMay this remember this great American now and during 7th Inning Stretch with Katie Casey sing a song\n\nTake Me Out to the Ballgame\n\nTake Me Out with the crowd\n\nBuy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack\n\nI don't care if I never get back\n\nLet me root, root, root, for the home team\n\nIf they don't win it's a shame\n\nFor it's 1, 2, 3, strikes your out\n\nAt the old ball game\n\nAlthough famous for writing \"Shine On, Harvest Moon,\" his most popular song by far is \"Take Me Out To The Ball Game,\" which he wrote in 1908. Only two songs is \"Happy Birthday To You\" (Mildred Jane Hill & Patty Smith Hill) and \"The Star Spangled Banner (USA National Anthem)\" (Francis Scott Key / John Stafford Smith) are sung more often. Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nAlthough he and Albert Van Tilzer wrote \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" in 1908, neither man had ever been to a baseball game in person, nor did they go to one for another 32 and 20 years, respectively. On both occasions, they were honored as the composers of baseball's unofficial national anthem.\n\nIn the 2018 video game We Happy Few, Norworth's 1910 song \"For Months and Months and Months\" is heard playing on an Edwardian phonograph in an abandoned house, with the first verse looping endlessly, only to wind down upon being approached.\n\nA 1910 wrote by Oscar Hammerstein entitled \"For Months and Months and Months\" mentions Norworth in its song\n\nGEDCOM Source\n\n@R-2146778335@ World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 Ancestry.com Online publication - Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2005.Original data - United States, Selective Service System.
