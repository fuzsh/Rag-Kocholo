Sandy was very athletic and loved to swim, explore the outdoors, Tai Chi, tell stories and spend time with her family, friends and all her dogs. She was a huge dog lover and over the years had more than a dozen dogs in her lifetime. She is now connected with them at the rainbow bridge and they are all running and playing in the dog park together.

He was born on June 19, 1944 to the late Otto and Mary (King) Blauser. Jim grew up on the family farm in Baltimore, Ohio. He worked hard raising pigs, baling hay and helping his father in the fields. Farming was in his blood, tractors were his toys. He served as President of the Liberty Union High School Future Farmers of America and went on to graduate from Ohio State University with a degree in Agricultural Science. Jim proudly served as a Captain in the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1970. Upon his honorable discharge, Jim returned to agriculture and was a corporate manager for the agricultural co-op Landmark/Countrymark. After his retirement, Jim went to work for Anheuser Busch until his ultimate retirement in 2012. Jim was a doer and never slowed down after retirement, he just did more. He could build, fix and grow anything. He was an accomplished woodworker and leaves behind cherished works from dollhouses to treehouses, jewelry and treasure boxes, tables, cabinetry and more. He loved to share his expertise with family, friends and neighbors and always lent a generous helping hand with home projects and repairs. If Jim was interested in doing something, he mastered it. He was a pilot and photographer. He grew his own grapes and made his own wine. He loved to cook and made a mean fruit cobbler. In between all his projects, he and his wife Ruth, traveled all over the United States and Europe. A twinkling blue-eyed redhead, Jim was equal parts ornery and charm. He teased everyone, including himself. He was endearing and exasperating all at the same time. He loved to laugh, especially at his own jokes. He maintained lifelong friends and met up with them regularly for coffee and to swap stories, or lies, as he called them. He would shoot the breeze with friends and strangers alike. Above all, Jim loved his wife, children and family. His grandchildren were his pride and joy and he delighted in spending time with them and hearing their latest news. He cheered every accomplishment and loved to attend their many games, recitals, and ceremonies. They will always remember Grandpa Jim’s laughter and legendary sayings. Why? Because ice cream doesn’t have any holes in it. Jim is deeply loved and will be greatly missed by all. In addition to his parents, Jim is preceded in death by his beloved son Joshua James Blauser. He is survived by his loving wife of 32 years, Ruth (Bauer) Blauser; children, Anne (Jason) Brengman, CDR David (Kellee) Blauser, USN, and Jeanette Curtis; daughter-in-law, Allison (Jeff) Hutton; grandchildren, Adelle and Jacob Blauser, Jackson (fiancé Teresa Crum) and Zane Brengman, Cannon and Colton Blauser, and Colin Smith; siblings, Suzanne (Mike) Keller and Bonnie (Dave) Grimm and former wife, Donna Blauser. Jim was a faithful member of the Lithopolis United Methodist Church. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his name. A visitation will be held Monday, June 21, 2021 from 2-4, 6-8 at DWAYNE R.
