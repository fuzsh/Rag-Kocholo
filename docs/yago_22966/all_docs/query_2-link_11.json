        "text": "* 39 days until the Mar 28, 2024, regular season opener against the Cubs\n\nToday there is nothing related to Feb 17 in traditional baseball or Rangers history. So I'm tossing out a couple of stories about baseball peripherals associated with this date.\n\nOn Feb 17, 1914, Cracker Jack began including baseball cards. There are 2 short thumbnails: (1) one onn early baseball cards and the Cracker Jack cards specifically; and (2) one on the Take Me Out to the Ball Game song that linked Cracker Jack to baseball and became baseball's anthem -- written by a composer and performer who never went to a baseball game until 32 years after writing the song, when he was honored at the game for writing it, and which was written as an ode to the woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair at the time, a famous actress and suffragist of the day. \"Katie Casey\" in the song was Trixie Friganza.\n\nFebruary 17, 1914\n\nCracker Jack Begins Shipping the Candy with Baseball Cards\n\nA Thumbnail on Early Baseball Cards and the 1914-15 Cracker Jack Cards\n\nA Thumbnail on Take Me Out to the Ball Game and Jack Norworth\n\nOn Feb 17, 1914, FW Rueckheim & Bros first began shipping to their distributors, boxes of their Cracker Jack confection with baseball cards as the \"prize\" in each box.\n\nA Thumbnail on Early Baseball Cards and the 1914-15 Cracker Jack Cards\n\nIn the mid-19th century, mass-produced inexpensive small photos of various celebrities became popular novelty items. The photographic reproductions often used either the standard sized 5×7 inch photographic paper or half (or less) of a standard 5×7 sheet, resulting in an index or playing card size. The less expensive card versions were lithographed in color onto white card stock.\n\nAs baseball increased in popularity and became an organized amateur and semi-professional sport during the late 1860s and 1870s, trade cards featuring baseball players appeared. \"Trade cards\", as opposed to \"trading cards\", were cards that had the name of the manufacturer or retail seller on it -- a \"trading card\" market would not be commercially developed for almost a century. Typically, a trade card of the time featured an image on one side and information advertising the business on the other. Advances in color printing increased the appeal of the cards. Some of the earliest baseball cards were produced as part of a children's game of baseball.\n\nIn 1868, Peck & Snyder, a sporting goods store in NYC with a national customer base, which was heavily involved in the development of baseball equipment, began producing the first trade cards featuring entire baseball teams, and later, individual star players. The cards would sometimes be sold at games or commemorate certain games. (While Spalding traditionally gets and deserves credit as the developer of modern versions of baseball equipment, it was Peck & Snyder, heavily involved in the Brooklyn and Manhattan amateur and semi-pro teams of the 1860's - 1870's, that worked with manufacturers to first produce the basic equipment of the sport.)\n\nIn any event, later in the 19th century, tobacco companies seized on the phenomena to promote sales of tobacco products. By early 1886, images of baseball players were often included on cards in cigarette packs and other tobacco products, partly for promotional purposes and partly because the cardboard helped to protect the cigarettes from damage. As the popularity of baseball spread to other countries, so did baseball cards. Production of sets of baseball cards spread to Japan as early as 1898, to Cuba as early as 1909, and to Canada in 1912.\n\nAt the turn of the century, tobacco companies also owned many of the national confectionery companies, and by the early 20th century, baseball cards began to be distributed with some candies. In 1903, the first major set of baseball cards in the 20th century was issued by the Breisch-Williams Company, a confectionery company based in PA. Between 1909-11, the American Caramel Company produced a series of cards, and in 1911 the \"Zee Nut\" baseball card was introduced. By the mid-teens, companies such as The Sporting News magazine began sponsoring card issues.\n\nRueckheim's Cracker Jack candy had become associated with baseball fortuitously, through the 1908 Tin-Pan Alley hit, Take Me Out to the Ball Game, and Rueckheim wanted to capitalize on that association. Sales of Cracker Jack at baseball parks had already increased, as the boxed confection could be easily sold in a stadium environment. The 1914-15 Cracker Jack baseball cards were artfully designed in the sweeping bold colors of the 1910's commercial art world, with colorized player photographs either in portraiture or in an action pose lithographed onto a red background on white card stock. No white ink was used in the printing, and the white card-stock uniforms blended into the white border of the card. Information on the player was provided on the reverse. The set included AL, NL and Federal League stars of the day, but is missing Babe Ruth, who had his own deal with a different confectionery company. The cards were stained by the caramel-colored oil in the candy, and the 1914 cards are quite rare. The initial issue in 1914 was so popular, however, that the 1915 expanded set was also sold by Rueckheim as a complete set through mail-in orders to the company, The 1915 cards and sets are available, if extremely expensive.\n\nAs WWI deepened, celebrity novelty cards lost their appeal, and paper drives during WWI's paper shortage discouraged both production or retention of the cards. No more Cracker Jack cards were produced. As the war ground to a close, national fashions and interest shifted, and the Black Sox scandal of 1919 seriously undermined the popular demand for baseball products. Baseball cards would have a resurgence of sorts in the 1930's, run into another World War, and then become \"trading cards\" in the modern sense in the 1950's and 1960's post-WWII sales to the booming adolescent market.\n\nA Thumbnail on Take Me Out to the Ball Game and Jack Norworth\n\nJack Norworth was a vaudeville performer, successful song writer, and early movie actor. He wrote songs in the Tin-Pan Alley style that told stories, for performance in vaudeville skits. The market for songs in the early 20th century included vaudeville and club performances, sheet music sales, growing phonograph sales, for several decades player-piano rolls, and in silent-film theater music and later in movie sound-tracks. While Take Me Out to the Ball Game was extremely popular at the time, and turned out to be Norworth's most popular song over historic time (it is included in virtually all compilations of the most popular and important American songs of the 20th century), it was never as popular during Norworth's life as was his (Shine On) Harvest Moon. Norworth had numerous other hit Tin-Pan Alley songs, but they have not endured as well.\n\nTake Me Out to the Ball Game tells the story for a skit of a guy who calls up a young woman, \"Katie Casey\", for a date to take her to a show. But the woman turns out to be an adamant baseball fan, who the original lyrics describe as \"baseball mad\". She accepts the date only if her suitor takes her to a ball game, where she apparently spends every Saturday, knows the game thoroughly, knows all of the players by first and last name, argues and screams at the umpire, and yells during the whole game. Truly adamant and outspoken female baseball fans were rare in those days. It, of course, became the anthem for baseball in parks and shows, but generally using only the chorus. Norworth rewrote parts of the song in 1927 with better-known modern lyrics to suit an ML baseball anthem, and the verses have often been reworked by a host of both serious and comedic singers and musical groups. The song's first use as a 7th-inning stretch song over a ML baseball-stadium PA system appears to have occurred during Game 4 of the 1934 WS.\n\nIt is well known that Norworth was not a baseball fan and had never been to a baseball game at the time. He wrote the song on the NYC subway, inspired by a subway advertisement that simply read, \"Baseball Today -- Polo Grounds\". The original lyrics, written on the back of an envelope, are maintained in a display at the National Baseball HoF. Norworth would not go to his first baseball game until 32 years later, when he was honored at the game for writing the song.\n\nWhat is not so well known, and a fact that ML baseball does not like to publicize, is that Norworth wrote the song to his girlfriend, the progressive and outspoken Trixie Friganza, a famous vaudeville actress and suffragist, with whom he was having an affair. Friganza was a vaudeville star by the age of 19, with an impactful life both on and off the stage. She would become a famous comedic stage and movie actress known for playing larger-than-life characters. Off-stage, she was an influential and prominent suffragist who advocated women’s social and political equality. The Women’s Progressive Suffrage Union held the first suffrage march in the US in NYC in 1908, the year that the song was written. Friganza was a vital and highly vocal and promoted image in the movement that was seeking to draw young, dynamic women into the cause. She attended virtually every NYC rally at the time, regularly gave speeches at the rallies, and donated generously.\n\nIn 1908, Norworth's wife, actress Louise Dresser announced to the press that her husband was leaving her for another actress, creating a public scandal in the tabloid press. Norworth and Friganza were hot tabloid news. Friganza was with Norworth on the subway when he wrote the baseball song. Norworth never tried to hide the fact that the saga of \"Katie Casey\" in the song was about Friganza. Significantly, Friganza's picture gratuitously appears appears on the first two editions of the sheet music for the song. Katie was Trixie, a liberated woman fan in a man's spectator sport.\n\nNorworth, however, evidently apparently considered Friganza to be a lover and not a soul-mate. Norworth's divorce from Dresser was finalized on Jun 15, 1908, just one month after the publication of the song. The following week, Norworth married his Ziegfeld Follies costar, Nora Bayes, not Trixie Friganza. Baynes sang the original phonograph recording of the song. The news apparently came as a surprise to both tabloid readers and Friganza, but Friganza recovered and went on to star in over 20 films, marry twice and advocate for the rights of women and children throughout her life.\n\n[Both early and late versions of the song are provided as player-jump audio in the Wikipedia articles on the song and Norworth, below. The audio of the entire 29-min Smithsonian podcast on Friganza and the song is player-jumped in the Smithsonian article below.]\n\nJohn McMurray, 1914-15 Cracker Jack baseball cards (SABR 2018)\n\nCracker Jack Baseball Cards: A True American Classic (All Vintage Cards 2023)\n\n1914 Cracker Jack Baseball Cards (Cardboard Connection)\n\n1915 Cracker Jack Baseball Cards (Cardboard Connection)\n\nCracker Jack (Wikipedia)\n\nBaseball card (Wikipedia)\n\nAnna Layman, The Feminist History of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" (Smithsonian)\n\nTake Me Out to the Ball Game (Wikipedia)\n\nJack Norworth (Wikipedia)"
