        "text": "This Nora Bayes-Jack Norworth song was first published in 1908 as a Tin Pan Alley song. It was about a couple having a night of love under the titled moon, as simple as that. Bayes and Norworth were married performers and they introduced the song in The Ziegfeld Follies. Even though it was a simple little tune, it went a long away, becoming a hit. The song became a popular standard recording as the years went on, being performed by such luminaries as Ruth Etting, Vaughn Monroe, and Rosemary Clooney to name a few. The song hadn’t appeared in films until The Heart of New York (1932) and was played on a record. That year, however, an animated short was named after the song. In 1932 the song also appeared in the Ruth Chatterton vehicle The Rich Are Always with Us (1932; known today for an early Bette Davis role), the song was used for background music at an event in the film. The song appeared in several more shorts including Along Came Ruth, California Weather, and Knee Deep in Music (all 1933) all featuring Ruth Etting. The song continued to appear in short films until a chorus of girls performed the song for The Great Ziegfeld (1936), making a great deal of sense since it was originally a Follies song.\n\nAppearing in more feature length films, it was in the forgotten Humphrey Bogart film Two Against the World (1936), and even then it was only used for radio music. It was in another lesser Warner Bros. film, Bengal Tiger (1936). It was incorporated more prominently into Marion Davies’s last film Ever Since Eve (1937) where Allen Jenkins performed it on the piano and sang the song. It was also performed by Don Barclay and Hal Neiman’s two drunk characters. It appeared in the excellent comedy A Slight Case of Murder (1938) where the comical Ruth Donnelly performed the song. The early Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison film Sidewalks of London (1938), the song was performed by a band (the British film included several popular American standards). 20th Century Fox put the song to good use in Rose of Washington Square (1939) where Louis Prima performed the song. It ended being in ‘30s films with Oliver Hardy singing the song in The Flying Deuces (1939) and later dancing to it with Stan Laurel, of course.\n\nBy the ‘40s the song wasn’t used as often, but when it did appear it made a more lasting impact. The song had a film dedicated to it with the same name in 1944. It starred Dennis Morgan and Ann Sheridan as Norworth and Bayes and they performed the theme song several times (Sheridan was dubbed by Lynn Martin for no good reason). The song is played twice as background music for the wonderful A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945). The song was performed four years later by the stellar foursome of the Wilde Twins, Rosemary DeCamp, and Charlie Ruggles in Look for the Silver Lining (1949), another musical “biography”, this time about the great Marilyn Miller. The song made a delightful quick number for Nancy Goes to Rio (1950) where Jane Powell, Ann Sothern, and Louis Calhern perform it after Calhern reminisces his time as a leading man. The song appeared for a short period of time in I’ll See You in My Dreams (1951). The song’s last hurrah in classic films (and probably films altogether, thus far) was having Tyrone Power as Eddy Duchin perform the number on piano (played by pianist Carmen Cavallero). Even though the song is a popular tune and an icon of the early 1900s, films seem to have forgotten that.\n\n~Bianca"
