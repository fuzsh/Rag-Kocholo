Before the World Wars and the Great Depression, it was a time of robust industrial expansionism and increasing American influence in world affairs. It was the dawn of the age of the trolley and the subway, the automobile and the airplane, the telephone and the electric light. In family affairs, the man was the undisputed head of the household; the Women’s Suffrage movement did not give women the vote until 1920. High morals, influenced by the fashions of Victorian and Edwardian England, held popular sway and revered the family as sacrosanct. The mother was considered beyond reproach, a boy’s best friend, while sisters and daughters were sheltered from contact with the outside world at all cost. Men maintained a double standard which permitted them to frequent places of ill-repute while keeping their families at a safe and comfortable distance. Naturally, in the midst of near-universal repression, the bawdier side of life thrived. Saloons, gambling joints, burlesques, and brothels were commonplace and the songs of the era celebrated both extremes and the ample territory in between with vigor and relish.\n\nSongs came to life or failed on the stage. There was no radio or record industry to rely upon. Defining the lifestyle of the popular singer during this period was the performance venue of vaudeville. The vaudeville circuit saw its modest beginnings in the 1880’s, but quickly flourished into a big business, and became known as a highly respectable venue for, specifically, “family” entertainment; producers were typically vigilant in insisting that performer’s routines were suitable for women and children. The vaudeville show, on which virtually all of the songs contained on this recording were premiered and regularly heard, was a magnificent conglomeration of dissimilar entertainments, presented by a large number of performers. Typically, an evening would include several short skits, comic monologues, comedy routines, animal acts, instrumental musical numbers, songs, acrobatic routines, a men’s quartet, and so on. Authentic variety shows, they achieved extraordinary popularity throughout the early part of this century, finally to be replaced by moving pictures, a development many lament to this day.\n\nStylistically, the songs collected here range far. During this period, before the categorizing of music into discreet genres took hold, there was little distinction made between differing compositional styles. Popular music was considered more accessible and less serious than concert music, but singing and playing styles were essentially undifferentiated. It was commonplace for successful opera stars to do a turn on vaudeville between more formal engagements; their singing style was suitable for much of the popular song of the day. As the turn-of-the-century saw the beginnings of the blues, ragtime and jazz each start to take hold, these styles were as yet fluid and largely undefined. During the 1890’s, the influence of these musical innovations of black Americans began to be felt in the popular compositions of mainstream white composers, often watered-down or modified to accommodate their needs or abilities. Hence, by 1900, popular music included formal sentimental ballads which in many ways resembled European art songs and operetta(“A Bird in a Gilded Cage,” “When You Were Sweet Sixteen”), bluesy, slightly bawdy songs (“Coax Me,” “Teasing”), songs with roots in ragtime (“Under the Bamboo Tree”), comic, or novelty songs (“In My Merry Oldsmobile,” “Goodbye My Lady Love”), and jazzy songs (“Shine On Harvest Moon”). Yet all were performed by the same artists, in the same venues.\n\nThe instrumental numbers on this recording, on the other hand, are uniform in both style and composer: piano rags of Scott Joplin. Composed during the same period as the songs (1901-1909), they offer a glimpse of the most popular instrumental music of the day. While Joplin was not the only ragtime composer who was successful at this time (others included Tom Turpin, Louis Chauvin, James Scott, Joseph Lamb, and Scott Hayden), Joplin was the most musically sophisticated, refined and prolific, with an oevre of some five hundred compositions.\n\nSome listeners may be curious about the use of the guitar for this music. The classical guitar was present and gaining in popularity in America at this time. American schools of playing had emerged early on in the 19th century, and continued to flourish. In addition, the “folk” guitar had caught on, in part through the success of the cheap models offered through the Sears catalog. Songs which were popular were played by anyone, on whatever instrument was available, including the guitar, banjo, mandolin, and, later, the ukelele. Publishers were quick to capitalize on the increased sales possibilities of offering music in a variety of arrangements, and it is common to see listings on sheet music of alternate versions for piano solo, four-hand piano, brass ensemble, solo instrument with piano, mandolin with guitar, men’s chorus, etc. It is true, though, that classical guitar arrangements were generally not among those marketed, for the simple reason that there were too few accomplished classical guitarists at this time in America to justify the arrangements. The inclusion of the guitar implied chord-symbol-type strummed accompaniments.\n\nThe arrangements on this recording, on the other hand, accurately reproduce the piano accompaniments originally published, including melodic interludes and original bass lines. In some cases, the original is subtly amplified with additional countermelodies or fuller harmonies, in the way an accomplished pianist will improvise a slightly fuller version of the accompaniment based on his abilities, experience and knowledge of style. In the case of the ragtime solos, these arrangements are fully faithful to the originals. In fact, they work extremely well on the guitar and sound quite at home there! This music becomes more personal in these readings with the guitar than is possible on the piano, and we feel that this more intimate aesthetic is highly effective and eminently suitable; that it is, in fact, in the true spirit of the originals.\n\nThese songs of yesteryear, of a long-bygone era, seem as fresh and poignant today as they might have been then. They offer a peek at a world less complicated, more emotionally honest, more...innocent. In today’s world, such a music brings with it unexpected delights. At our concerts, we are thrilled when our elders respond so warmly to these familiar gems their parents and grandparents sang at the piano. We have been especially delighted, though, to discover that our peers and those younger respond with just as much enthusiasm, even when the music is utterly new to them. In this music, we have a true American treasure, an authentic American “art song” tradition. We would be most gratified if through this modest effort, we have helped that tradition to “Shine On” into the future.\n\n----Stephen Aron ©1997\n\n2. Coax Me\n\nwords by by Andrew Sterling, music by by Harry von Tilzer, 1904\n\nOne common performance genre was given the unfortunate name “coon song.” Derived from the successes of the black-face routines often featured in the traveling minstrel shows of the mid-1800’s, in which white actors and singers literally colored their faces and performed caricatures of blacks, “coon songs” are often marked by a none-too-subtle condescending or patronizing tone. While such songs are justifiably out of circulation today, they were immensely popular one hundred years ago, when public sensibilities were not as attuned to the plights of American blacks as they are today. This Harry von Tilzer number must be considered a “coon song” because of the reference to the “dusky” lovers, and the mild use of dialect (“I wants to wed”), but it is thoroughly inoffensive and charming in its portrayal of the suitor whose desires are held at bay (or invited) by his girl who asks to “coaxed.” The lighthearted, even humorous tone of the song’s opening is delightfully contrasted by its slyly salacious chorus.\n\nA night in June, a lovely moon,\n\nBeneath the trees two dusky lovers wooing.\n\nHe softly sighs, she rolls her eyes,\n\nSoon just like a turtle dove he’s sweetly cooing:\n\n“On those ruby lips I’d like to press a kiss Lize,\n\nJust one or two, perhaps a few;\n\nCan’t I take you in my arms, a moment’s bliss, Lize,\n\nJust because you are the girl I wants to wed?”\n\nBut she said:\n\nCoax me, go on and coax me,\n\nIf you love me madly, want me badly,\n\nCoax me, go on and coax me,\n\nI’ll be your tootsie, wootsie, if you’ll coax me.\n\nOnce more he sighs, “I love you Lize,\n\nIf I should go just think what you’d be missing.”\n\nThen on the breeze, from ‘neath the trees,\n\nCame a noise that sounded just like someone kissing.\n\nAnd a tender voice said “give me just one more, Lize;\n\nThat one I had made me so glad.\n\nDon’t you think you better make it three or four, Lize,\n\nAnd I’ll pay them back to you the day we wed.”\n\nBut she said:\n\nCoax me...\n\n8. After The Ball\n\nwords and music by Charles K. Harris, 1892\n\nLong regarded as the song which launched the modern music publishing industry, After the Ball was the first to sell five million copies. Charles K. Harris, born in 1867, moved from Milwaukee to New York to open his own publishing firm, having thus far published only one other song, for a royalty check of 85 cents. Before his death in 1930, Harris had produced many successful songs, including I’m Trying So Hard to Forget (1893), Break the News to Mother (1897), Hello Central, Give Me Heaven (1901), and The Best Thing In Life (1907). It was After the Ball however, published in 1892 and Harris’ first hit, which lasts in memory not only as his most effective song, but as the piece of sheet music which truly changed an entire industry. In order to get the song premiered, Harris had to pay a performer cash and a percentage of sales royalties. Nevertheless, at the first performance’s conclusion, the audience remained quiet for a full minute, then rose as one for a wild standing ovation lasting a full five minutes. After only one year, Harris was receiving over $25,000/week from royalties from this song; a band arrangement of it became a regular feature of programs by John Philip Sousa, it was vaudevillian Helene Mora’s showstopper, and it eventually sat on pianos in homes across America, creating a frenzy among other composers and publishers for a repeat of this amazing new money-making phenomenon: the popular song.\n\nA little maiden climbed an old man’s knee,\n\nBegged for a story “do Uncle please.\n\nWhy are you single; why live alone?\n\nHave you no babies; have you no home?”\n\n‘I had a sweetheart, years, years ago;\n\nWhere she is now, pet, you will soon know.\n\nList’ to the story, I’lltell it all,\n\nI believed her faithless after the ball.’\n\nAfter the ball is over, after the break of morn,\n\nAfter the dancers’ leaving; after the stars are gone;\n\nMany a heart is aching if you could read them all;\n\nMany the hopes that have vanished after the ball.\n\nBright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom.\n\nSoftly, the music playing sweet tunes.\n\nThere came my sweetheart, my love, my own.\n\n‘I wish some water; leave me alone.’\n\nWhen I returned, dear, there stood a man,\n\nKissing my sweetheart as lovers can.\n\nDown fell the glass pet, broken, that’s all,\n\nJust as my heart was after the ball.\n\nAfter the ball...\n\nLong years have passed child, I’ve never wed,\n\nTrue to my lost love, though she is dead.\n\nShe tried to tell me, tried to explain;\n\nI would not listen, pleadings were vain.\n\nOne day a letter came from that man,\n\nHe was her brother, the letter ran.\n\nThat’s why I’m lonely, no home at all;\n\nI broke her heart pet, after the ball.\n\nAfter the ball...\n\n17. When You Were Sweet Sixteen\n\nwords and music by James Thornton, 1898\n\nOne of the most prolific ballad composers of the 1890’s, James Thornton came to America from England, where he was born in 1861. Launched in 1890 with the hit My Sweetheart Is the Man on the Moon, Thornton went on to compose many other successful ballads, including She May Have Seen Better Days (1894), The Streets of Cairo (1895), and It Don’t Seem Like the Same Old Smile (1896). His biggest hit that decade, though, was When You Were Sweet Sixteen, written as a love song to his wife, vaudevillian Bonnie Thornton. A thoroughly sentimental song, it still has the power to affect the listener. Thornton went on to pen another hit still well-known, Sweet Adeline (1903); it remains a favorite of men’s quartets and choirs today.\n\nWhen first I saw the love-light in your eye,\n\nAnd heard thy voice like sweetest melody,\n\nSpeak words of love to my enraptur’d soul,\n\nThe world had not but joy in store for me.\n\nE’en though we’re drifting down life’s stream apart,\n\nYour face I still can see in dream’s domain;\n\nI know that it would ease my breaking heart,\n\nTo hold you in my arms just once again.\n\nI love you as I never lov’d before,\n\nSince first I met you on the village green,\n\nCome to me, or my dream of love is o’er,\n\nI love you as I loved you, when you were sweet,\n\nWhen you were sweet sixteen.\n\nLast night I dreamt I held your hand in mine,\n\nAnd once again you were my happy bride.\n\nI kiss’d you as I did in Auld Lang Syne,\n\nAs to the church we wander’d side by side.\n\nThe love I bear for you can never die;\n\nWithout you I had rather not been born;\n\nAnd even tho’ we never meet again,\n\nI love you as the sunshine loves the morn.\n\nI love you as...\n\n18. Let The Rest Of The World Go By\n\nwords by J. Kiernan Brennan, music by Ernest R. Ball, 1909\n\nThe composer of many of the most beloved ballads from the first decade of this century, Ernest R. Ball came to New York from Cleveland, where, born in 1878, he received his education at the Cleveland Institute of Music. The first song he wrote, with words by the New York politician (and future mayor), James Walker, was an enormous hit, Will You Love Me In December As You Do In May? (1903). After that, Ball penned numerous successful ballads, including Love Me and the World Is Mine (1906), Mother Machree (1910), Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold (1911), When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (1912), and the present song. Let the Rest of the World Go By was featured in a film biography of Ernest Ball, When Irish Eyes are Smiling, released in 1944, seventeen years after his death, and featuring Dick Haymes. Movie buffs will also recognize the melody of Let the Rest of the World Go By as the theme song of the film Out Of Africa with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.\n\nIs the struggle and strife\n\nWe find in this life\n\nReally worthwhile, after all?\n\nI’ve been wishing today\n\nI could just run away,\n\nOut where the west winds call.\n\nWith someone like you, a pal good and true,\n\nI’d like to leave it all behind, and go and find\n\nSome place that’s known to God alone,\n\nJust a spot to call our own.\n\nWe’ll find perfect peace, where joys never cease,\n\nOut there beneath a kindly sky,\n\nWe’ll build a sweet little nest\n\nSomewhere in the west,\n\nAnd let the rest of the world go by.\n\nIs the future to hold\n\nJust struggles for gold\n\nWhile the real world waits outside,\n\nAway out on the breast\n\nOf the wonderful west,\n\nAcross the great divide?\n\nWith someone like you...\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nBerlin, Edward A.
