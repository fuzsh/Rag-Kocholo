        "text": "Unsupported>\n\nErnest August Hoen\n\n(September, 1852 to April, 1914)\n\nUnsupported>\n\nEdward Weber Hoen\n\n(August, 1862 to April 12, 1941) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nBest represented musically by the large remaining cache of E.T. Paull publications, the A. Hoen lithography house hosted some of the finest craftsmen of the trade, adept not only at superb illustrations and mapwork, but the demanding process of color separation onto multiple stones as well. Unfortunately for the sake of historic clarification or recognition, virtually all who worked for Hoen were \"company men\" whose names have not made it to print, unless they were cleverly concealed within the drawings somewhere. There was also a very coherent and uniform style with most of the Hoen covers and posters, which would make it even harder to distinguish the work of any individual artist. There are employee names throughout the years associated with the firm, but their duties are not clearly known.\n\nThe firm was initially started by German immigrant Edward Weber and his nephew Ferdinand August Hoen in Baltimore, Maryland in 1835 as Edward Weber & Company. They printed the first color cards ever produced in the United States and the first lithographic maps printed in the country as well in 1842 for the Fremont Reports, connected to the United States Congressional Reports. August took the firm over with his brother Ernest Hoen and cousin Henry Hoen in 1848 upon Weber's death. Hoen's new firm of A. Hoen & Company not only provided some very fine monochrome and color covers and litho-photography for local Baltimore publishers, but for firms in Washington, D.C. and as far off as the Carolinas.\n\nSome of the artist's names from that era, notably Clayton (a prolific Baltimore engraver), Gillingham, Webb, Duffy and W. French, have been found on some covers. In the 1860s August Hoen patented what he termed the Lithocaustic method of lithography which allowed for easier viewing of the etching in the stone while it was in progress, making the shading of gradients and halftones a much faster process. He prominently displayed a critically acclaimed print from this process in the 1876 Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From 1860 to 1883 August was awarded several patents for processes intended to create improved halftone prints with both monochromatic and multi-stone lithography.\n\nHenry worked with the Baltimore firm until his death in 1893. Alfred Tennyson Hoen (b. 1873), the youngest of the six sons and three daughters of the founder, ran the A. Hoen lithography firm in Baltimore with older brother Albert Berthold Hoen throughout the early 20th century. August Hoen died in 1886, before the reign of E.T. Paull, but certainly with a well-cemented reputation for top quality prints, very notably on some beautiful cigar boxes. Albert and Alfred were also important contributors of cartography prints done for the U.S. Geological Survey, and later for the Geographical review. Alfred would continue his father's work in creating improvements in the process, particularly in the use of varying grades of lithographic limestone and similar sources. Albert rendered many improvements in setting uniform color standards. The Baltimore branch also produced a few mono and chromolithographic music sheets from the 1860s to the 1880s.\n\nA branch of A. Hoen eventually surfaced in Richmond, Virginia, run mostly by one of August's sons, Ernest August Hoen, who was named after his uncle, assisted by his younger cousin, Ernest's son Edward Weber Hoen, named after the founder. Ernest was a fine musician and music lover who attended Loyola College. August had opened a branch in Richmond, Virginia around the time of the Civil War, and one of their first contracts was to print confederate money. After learning the printing business with his father, he moved to Richmond became the manager in the early 1880s, but it is hard to discern if any of the Baltimore artists followed. Some sources cite 1876 as the year he moved, but Ernest is still shown as working for his father or uncle in Baltimore at the time of the 1880 census, and still living in Baltimore for the 1887 city directory.\n\nIn the newer Richmond plant the quality of inks and paper stock, as well as the multi-layer lithography process itself saw great advances, to the point where most Hoen-produced covers and cigar boxes from the 1890s forward still retain their original hues after more than a century. Whereas most sheet music publishers used from one to three colors in simple patterns for their covers, E.T. Paull was looking for something more, and settled on the five color multi-layer process utilized by Hoen, instantly setting his works apart visually and thus creating sales for what the consumer viewed as both music and art. Oldest sibling Adolph G. Hoen eventually moved to Richmond, but his involvement in the firm may be peripheral, as he was listed as a physician in 1910.\n\nThe works by the Hoen firm are usually well-marked so their parentage is clear, whether it be maps, cigar boxes, business stationary, posters, or their beautiful sheet music covers over a period of seven-plus decades. Focusing on the era of E.T. Paull, they tended towards not only a high modicum of realism (with very few caricatures), but a level of detail in the backgrounds that most cover artists ignored. This may well have been at the insistence of Paull, who most certainly knew what he wanted.\n\nThe Baltimore branch of Hoen had been creating lithographic covers since 1848 and chromolithographic sheet music covers since 1851, mostly serving a wide range of Baltimore and Philadelphia music publishers. Among their most frequent Baltimore clients were the firms of George Willig, F.D. Benteen and Henry McCaffrey. However, their sheet music cover output appears to have ended in the mid-1880s.\n\nThe Richmond branch of A. Hoen, on the other hand, had no history of providing sheet music cover art before they were contracted for The Chariot Race or Ben Hur March in 1894 by E.T. Paull. It appears that his was the only sheet music they printed covers for (in most cases, the music plates themselves were created elsewhere), it is likely that Paull found some way to convince them that the visibility provided by his music might bring the firm more work at the very least. They were also possibly the only company in Richmond, much less Virginia, capable of the level of artistry he was looking for, with their enormous building covering a full city block, indicating stability and growth. At one point in the mid-1910s there were between 125 and 300 employees [reports vary] working at the Richmond branch.\n\nWhether it was a battle scene or some natural catastrophe, the vivid hues the Hoen firm achieved, often focusing on reds, provided great accent to even the smallest of details such as lava ash or a swinging sword. Even though it is common to display framed sheet music today, it was an honor applied largely to the Hoen works from the Paull catalog during the early 20th century. As Paull engaged the company even after he had moved to New York in 1896, with Hoen covers appearing into the late 1910s, there may be some possibility that some of the production was also done in the Baltimore branch of the firm, but this is difficult to verify as there were no distinct codes or indicators to identify this.\n\nErnest was an active member of Richmond society and a member of the Wednesday Club as well as the Philharmonic Orchestra of the Westmoreland Club. He was married to Baltimore native Clara Byrne and had two sons, Hudson P. Hoen and Dr. Walter Scott Hoen, a United States Navy surgeon in the 1910s. Ernest had his own printing patent listed in 1907, which consisted of a unique method for printing dispensable tickets. His health started to fail in 1913 and he retreated to Atlantic City, New Jersey in the spring of 1914 to try and recover. It was there that pneumonia took his life in April 1914. His son, Walter, died in July 1918 in Port Au Prince, Haiti, while on Naval duty.\n\nThe Richmond branch continued into the early 1930s under Edward Hoen, concentrating on the envelope business. He finally passed in 1941 at age 78. Both of the Hoens are buried at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Albert Hoen continued to run the Baltimore office as president of the firm until his death on May 1, 1956 at age 93. The original Baltimore office of the Hoen firm continued in the lithography and printing business until around 1981 when it dissolved after filing for bankruptcy.\n\nWilliam Austin Starmer\n\n(January 28, 1872 to February 15, 1957)\n\nFrederick Waite Starmer\n\n(September 2, 1878 to March 19, 1962)\n\nSelected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nVirtually anybody who has even a minimal sheet music collection that includes ragtime-era items likely has a cover done by one of the prolific Starmer Brothers. They had a consistency that was hard to match in terms of creating eye-catching cover art that did justice to or often outshined the contents within. By some accounts, they were responsible for nearly a quarter of all signed covers in large format from 1900 to around 1919, and continued producing cover art into the mid-1940s.\n\nThe artists were both born and raised in Leeds, Yorkshire England, William in 1872 and Frederick in 1878, to boot maker James Starmer and Ann Elizabeth Starmer. There was one older brother, Edwin J. Starmer, born around 1868. In the 1891 England census, the family was shown living at the same address in Leeds that they were in a decade prior, and 19-year-old William was listed as a litho-artist or lithographer. The brothers and their father eventually relocated from England to New York City, William in 1898 and Frederick in 1899. James returned to England for a time, followed by William in 1900, who went back to marry Julietta Dawson. He returned to New York shortly thereafter to continue his work. The rest of the Starmer family and Julietta followed in June 1904. The brothers were set up fairly soon as draftsmen and artists. For many years, it was hard to discern that there were two separate Starmers at work, since the covers had similar attributes and they all had the same Starmer signature.\n\nAccording to collector Marion Short, it was piano roll and sheet music collector Mike Montgomery who first discovered the identity of at least one of the Starmer brothers through an invoice obtained from the daughter-in-law of publisher Jerome H. Remick, a bill from William Austin Starmer. Curiously, it listed him as an \"Artist and Medical Draughtsman\" from Long Island. The brothers somehow escaped the 1900 census, but a check of the 1910 census showed that William was the older brother of Fredrick, and that they were immigrants from England. Even though William and Julietta had evidently had a son, William J. Starmer, in 1907, he was also curiously not listed in the record. Both brothers listed artist as their occupation in 1910, with William as \"commercial\" and Frederick as \"illustrating.\" William and his wife shared their Manhattan apartment with Frederick as well. Both also appeared at the same address in several Manhattan directories of the 1910s into the 1920s, usually with Frederick as draftsman and William as an artist.\n\nThe 1920 census showed all of the Starmers still living in the same apartment, with both brothers listed as commercial draftsmen. William's wife Julietta died on February 26, 1922. Passenger manifests of the 1910s and 1920s indicate many trips back to England as well, so they did stay connected with their home country. William was remarried to highly-regarded English teacher Edith Mary White in the summer of 1924 in Bradford, England, her native city. The following year she retired from a 35 year career of teaching, and was widely honored for her service, although in the New York state census for 1925 she still listed teacher as a profession. At the time of the 1930 census William's accountant son, 23 year-old William, Jr., was still living with the couple in Queens. William Sr. listed himself as a commercial artist with his own studio, likely the same situation as in previous years. The retired Mrs. Starmer also was noted in the newspapers frequently as leading the choirs at the Remsen Street Reformed Baptist Church in Queens in addition to her other church activities.\n\nWilliam Starmer made several trips back to England, likely to see family or keep his visa current, from as early as 1907 to the late 1930s before travel restrictions were in place due to the oncoming war. Both brothers sailed there and back in 1905, 1907, 1909, 1913 and 1924. On January 31, 1924, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. Frederick appears to have made one final round trip voyage in September 1925 before returning to England for good around 1929. Information on him in the 1930s is difficult to come by at this point, but it is assumed he continued a career in commercial art either in Bournemouth near Dorset. William took subsequent round trip voyages in 1927, 1929, 1936, 1937 and 1938. The 1940 enumeration taken in Queens showed him still listed as a commercial artist.\n\nIn the November 12, 1941, Long Island Daily Press, an article about William Starmer, now living in Astoria, New York, stated that Frederick had immigrated back to Bournemouth, England around 1929. Whether he continued his career as a full-time artist is uncertain, but as World War II was started, Frederick had a found another important position in his community:\n\nWilliam A. Starmer... a commercial artist, spent Armistice Day in the Astoria Station House, coloring maps of the precinct zones for civilian defense.\n\nHe opined that his brother, Fred W. Starmer, 63, also a commercial artist, was equally busy in civilian defense work 3,000 miles away in Bournemouth, England, where Fred is a post warden and has experienced more than 200 air raids since the outbreak of the war.\n\nLaying aside his paints and brushes and other tools for a moment, William related that he and his brother came to this country from England in 1898 and went into business as commercial artists. Fred returned to England 12 years ago.\n\nAs soon as the war began, the older brother said Fred began working on defense maps for the sections of Southampton and Weymouth, similar to the job which William is doing.\n\nThe older brother, who was one of the first to report to the Astoria police for post warden duty, said he received a letter from Fred several years ago but it was badly cut up [redacted] by the censor and all he could make out was: \"I have plenty to tell you.\" The censor, however, permitted a snapshot to pass\n\nIt showed Fred and eight other post wardens wearing their tin hats and gas masks, sitting in a sandbag shelter.\n\nWilliam died in New York in February 1957 at age 85, and Frederick followed in Bournemouth, England, in March of 1962 at age 84.\n\nThe sheer volume of work with the Starmer signature on it makes it clear that both of them worked in the sheet music field as well as their other pursuits. Assuming each brother signed their own covers, albeit with only the last name, and that there are some distinctions between the drawings they created in virtually every conceivable category and theme, it may be possible at some point to catalog to a certainty of 70% or higher which brother drew particular covers, and if there were any collaborative efforts. But given their closeness in both style and life-long pursuits, it would stand to reason that there was some crossover in their drawing styles, and perhaps many of the brilliant covers they turned out were collaborations.\n\nAs you look through their collection, represented here in only a small quantity, note their fluid use of color, as well as the ability to draw realistic people simply but elegantly without delving into caricature unless it was called for. There is a mix of still lifes with simply patterned covers, and their command of lettering in interestingly derived fonts is also evident. Style on many of the covers is paramount, whether it be for fashion or for fadeaways. Rarely did anything delve into negative stereotype, perhaps a part of their British upbringing. Much in the vein of Currier and Ives, the brothers often captured subjects in a candid photographic sense that made the drawings look very natural. Through Remick's enormous volume of distribution, their work is in many ways the face of the ragtime era at its best.\n\nUnsupported>\n\nEdgar M. Keller\n\n(September 12, 1867 to January 10, 1932) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nOne of the more consistent and important artists of sheet music during the ragtime era was Edgar M. Keller, whose work spread well beyond the world of New York music publishing. He was born far away from the city at a time prior to the nascent field of dynamic cover illustrations. Edgar was the fifth of six children born to Prussian immigrant Henry Keller and his Irish-born wife Mary Margaret Kenny in Crescent (now Crescent City), Del Norte County, on the California coast line just south of Oregon. His siblings included George Martin (1859), William Arthur (1861), Joseph F. (1864), Laura (1865) and Mary Margaret (1870). The 1870 and 1880 enumerations taken in Crescent showed Henry to be a shoemaker and bootmaker respectively. Edgar's mother, Mary Margaret, died in 1871, leaving Henry to raise his children alone. Laura died in 1875 at age 10, and young Mary may have been sent to reside with relatives as she did not appear in the 1880 record.\n\nGiven the lack of an 1890 census, it is unclear what Edgar may have been doing in his early twenties, but there is a good chance that he studied art and lithography with one or professionals during that period, even while still living in California. Keller moved to New York City in the late 1890s. While later one-paragraph biographies stated that he \"turned to art in 1907,\" the 1900 enumeration both belies that and potentially explains his training through immersion. He was living in Manhattan with his bride, Nell Adams Clark, whom he had married in 1897, and was clearly listed as an artist. In that same building at 939 Eighth Avenue near the intersection of 56th Street, there were several artists residing there as well, consituting an artist's colony of sorts. It was also a mere two blocks away from the Art Students League of New York, which had been founded in 1875. So it is clear that Edgar was immersed in the artist's culture of New York, and Nell possibly went along for the ride, as she eventually took the craft up as well.\n\nEdgar became versed in several different mediums, including etching, sculpting, oil and watercolor, and illustration. While in training to create his own style, and before he was widely exhibited, he went into the field of both book and sheet music illustration to provide a revenue stream. Some of his earliest work appeared in 1899 and 1900 for a couple of publishers, including Harry Von Tilzer. Then from mid-1900 forward Keller was employed by M. Witmark & Sons publications, and his fame spread from there. The Music Trade Review of July 6, 1901 notes that \"Edgar Keller is permanently employed by [Witmark] and puts in his best work in this line.\" He would do cover work for Witmark more or less exclusively over the next decade. At 42 years of age, Edgar was profiled in the March 14, 1908, edition of the Music Trade Review:\n\nWhen it is taken into consideration that M. Witmark & Sons publish a countless number of songs every year, and that of these some 90 per cent have color title pages, some idea may be gained of the amount of work which Edgar Keller accomplishes every twelve months. Yet he is never at a loss for an original idea. Year in and year out he has designed titles exclusively for Messrs. Witmark, who are always sure that Keller has something novel in reserve. Possessed of wonder natural talent, he has all the qualities which go to make the artist. His technical knowledge was acquired in the West, and the pride he takes in evolving some original form of lettering is only in line with his thoroughness in everything he attempts. Those of his numerous friends who visit his charming little studio uptown know that as a painter in oils he has done his best work. Personally he is a quiet reserved man with a high forehead and a finely cut boyish face. Very rare, indeed, does he express himself on any subject, but when he does offer an opinion it is always well worth listening to.\n\nIn addition to his work in sheet music, Keller illustrated some children's books, and created art and some verse for the New York Dramatic Mirror, an entertainment-related newspaper. By the early 1910s, if not earlier, both his oil landscapes and portraits were enjoying exhibitions in galleries and other places of prominence. Edgar managed to capture motion and light effectively, sometimes using very rough brush strokes, evoking more of a mood or ambience than realistically accurate renditions of his subjects. Although his music and magazine illustrations did not always have the same depth as his oils, they were still varied and appealing, usually including customized text that complemented the subject.\n\nIt appears that with his growing reputation in oils and exhibitions and commissions, Edgar possibly found sheet music illustration either less appealing or too time consuming, and after 1911 he was more or less out of the field. There are some covers brought into question that show up into the late 1910s issued by publishers other than Witmark with the Keller name on them. Some were provided by the artist on rare occasions (such as Laddie Boy), but it is uncertain if he was responsible for a few of them lacking his first name. The most evident reason for the sudden halt of covers is that Edgar became involved with Bison Film Company under Thomas Ince around 1912, and given a role as a technical and artistic advisor on Westerns and Civil War films. He was also employed as a set designer or background scene painter, among other duties, for a couple of months. However, in short order Keller became an actor, ultimately appearing in around two dozen silent shorts and features from 1912 to 1926, much of it with director Francis Ford. Edgar even tried his hand at directing The Yellow Girl in 1916. This meant travel back west as well, and it is probable that the Kellers were in San Diego, California, during the mid-1910s, then in Los Angeles through 1917. However, by 1918, Edgar was re-established in Manhattan, where the 1920 enumeration showed him running his own art studio.\n\nIn 1921, Keller spent a great deal of time in the Binghamton, New York, area, creating landscapes. One of them titled \"The Black Pearl\" received honors and a prominent exhibit. It showed \"a hole in the ice on the Chenango River with the dark outlines of Mount Prospect and buildings on the far bank of the river, all casting an iridescent glow into the pool of dark water.\" Edgar had reportedly driven by the area and found it to be interesting enough to drop anchor for a while. In the mid-1920s, Edgar and Nell relocated to northern California, then spent some time in Portland, Oregon, where they were located for the 1930 census, both of them now working as artists in their own studio.\n\nWhat was not revealed in the 1930 record was that Edgar, now nearly 63, was ill. Although the nature of his malady was not made known, some indications from scant records imply that it was either cancer or heart disease. Later in 1930 the couple went down to Hollywood, California, possibly to gain some work with the motion picture trade. However, Edgar became increasingly ill, and finally passed on in early 1932 at 64 years of age. He is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California. Nell survived him another 33 years, growing a reputation as a fine artist in her own right.\n\nCharles Arthur Etherington\n\n(October 27, 1880 to March, 1960) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nThere are a group of signed artists in the sheet music world that, although they had a signature, they are considered to be \"Mystery Illustrators\" since virtually nothing is known about them outside of their printed artwork. Hopefully this entry will help to demystify to some degree the identity of the person behind the creative covers of the 1900s to 1920s drawn by the artist who signed them simply \"Etherington.\" As with many such figures, information is scant, but it still gives a little more background than has previously been known on this illustrator.\n\nCharles Arthur Etherington was born in late 1880 in Hartford, Connecticut to machinist Charles Allison Etherington and his bride Carrie Cooper of Springfield, Massachusetts. He would soon be joined by one sibling, Howard W., in January of 1882. By that time, the elder Charles was listed in Hartford directories as an engraver at a printing company, and would soon be considered an artist. It is not clear what happened to Carrie, but by 1890 she was no longer in the household due to death or divorce, and Charles was remarried to his second wife Abbie. Directories from 1889 to 1898 showed him working for the Calhoun Printing Company as an artist or engraver. Starting in 1897, the younger Charles was shown working as a clerk for the Pope Manufacturing Company company, primarily a bicycle builder at that time. The 1900 enumeration showed the senior Charles still listed as an artist, albeit independent now, and the younger one, most often listed as C. Arthur Etherington, as a bookkeeper.\n\nAt some point during the next few years C. Arthur went into the family business of art and engraving, possibly trained by his father among others. Around 1905 he migrated to New York City, and his talent soon got him work in advertising and the recently burgeoning field of sheet music covers. His first work was likely as an independent contractor, providing art for the music publishing houses of Gus Edwards and Harry Von Tilzer in 1906 and 1907. However, by 1908 his client base had expanded. By then he was working for the printing firm of Teller, Sons & Dorner. Etherington's work was well-regarded, and a 1908 ad in the Music Trade Review placed by music publisher Theo. Bendix touted him as part of a talented pool of composers, lyricists and artists. In addition to Edwards and Von Tilzer, he was also providing work for Joseph Morris, F.B. Haviland, Joseph W. Stern and Ted Snyder. A March 14, 1908, article in the Music Trade Review by fellow artist Gene Buck on the \"Evolution of the Title Page\" mentioned Charles in passing, putting him in good company:\n\nLet it not be supposed that the artist alone is responsible for the vast improvement which is apparent in the production of the modern title page. I think that I am safe in saying that ten years ago Edgar Keller was just as talented an artist as he is to-day—not as finished perhaps—but the wonderful creative genius which he has displayed for years in designing the Witmark title pages must have been just as apparent a decade ago. Again, take [William and Frederick] Starmer, [Charles] Etherington and [John] Frew, who like myself are \"free lances,\" designing for anybody who wishes to engage our services; their versatility has surely not come to light in a day. The question is naturally asked them, \"to what source is due the marvelous artistic strides made in the modern title page?\" and the answer lies in the fact that the credit is largely due to the improvement in mechanical production.\n\nGiven the often challenging nature of multi-color lithography, it was likely a double-edged sword that newer methods eschewing the old lithography stones both made the cover artists' work easier, while at the same time offering new opportunities for artists with less skill in these methods to enter the field. With perhaps 12 primary and another dozen or more secondary artists working in New York City music publishing by 1910, the roster was not exactly crowded, which helped Etherington and his handful of peers to stand out. He was certainly prolific, turning out forty or more covers a year from 1908 to 1911. And then, the flow stopped abruptly.\n\nCharles had married Louise Filler in 1906 in Manhattan, her second marriage to his first. Eight years his senior, her reported age changed several times over the next two decades, including when she was wed to Charles. The 1910 census, taken in Manhattan, showed that she had lost all six of her children, likely in infancy or at birth. That same record showed Charles as a lithographer and artist. Yet within two years, his prolific flow of sheet music covers would all but stop. There is no clear reason for this, but perhaps he decided to focus on advertising art or book illustration, or even magazines. The 1915 New York census still showed him as working in art and lithography, and his 1918 draft record listed him in the same field, working for what looks like the Alphw Lithography Company on 9th Avenue. It also described the artist as being 6'2\" with black hair. By 1920 the couple had temporarily relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, residing with Dr. Alfred Bailey and his wife, who may have been a relation of some sort. Again, Charles showed his occupation as commerical artist for the enumeration, but pinning down his extant work from this period was difficult.\n\nThe Etheringtons were back in New York fairly soon, found living in Nassau on Long Island in 1920s directories and the 1925 New York State census. However, at some point prior to 1930, they had relocated to Chicago, Illinois, found there at the start of the Great Depression. From this point on there is largely speculation as to where his life went. The Depression was hard on many artists, with only a few of the best surviving. It appears that during this time Louise dropped out of the picture, either due to death or divorce, and Charles moved to Lyndhurst, Ohio, to reside with his brother Howard, who was working as a trash collector. While he was not found in the 1940 census, he was noted in a couple of mentions in newspapers as working for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's largest New Deal programs, as an art supervisor. Charles' 1942 draft record showed him as having a crippled right arm, the cause of which was not known, but which may have inhibited his direct work in art over the prior decade, thus his WPA role. After World War II, Abbie passed on, and Charles went to Lyndhurst, Ohio, to stay with his brother Howard for a time. He was found there for the 1950 enumeration as a lithographer and \"makers [sic] of posters.\" Charles subsequently relocated to Miami, Florida, where he died in March of 1960 at age 79.\n\nOn his sheet music covers, Etherington showed versatility and consistency, but not all that much uniqueness in comparison to some of his peers. The work was solid, and encompassed several different styles during his six year run, using a palette of two to three colors for the most part. His human figures were well-rendered, particularly on sentimental pieces, but lacked whimsy in some cases. Overall, C.A. Etherington was a capable and prolific artist with solid skills, and should be regarded as one of the major contributors to the look of sheet music, part of the appeal that led to sales, during the middle of the ragtime era.\n\nUnsupported>\n\nEdward Eugene \"Gene\" Buck\n\n(August 8, 1884 to February 24, 1957) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nEugene Buck (possibly Jean in his early years) was born in 1884 in Detroit, Michigan to George Buck and Catherine McCarthy. He had two other brothers, including Charles A. (7/18/1883) and George W. (1889). Gene was, as some have called it, a triple or quadruple threat, known nearly as well as a musician, lyricist, composer and producer as he was for his cover art contributions.\n\nEugene's father was an inventor, but he died when the boy was around nine years old, leaving his family nearly destitute. Catherine managed to keep them in a home in Detroit and made sure her sons got a proper education in a parochial school, and two years at a Jesuit college for Gene. Out of that college at age 18, Gene got a job working for two dollars per week at the Dime Savings Bank, a career in which he proved to be totally unsuitable. Using the funds he earned at the bank, Gene obtained formal training at the Detroit Art Academy, focusing on Art Noveau. Buck was soon employed by a stationery manufacturing firm designing covers and borders. This company was responsible for the bulk of the sheet music covers used by Whitney Warner music in Detroit. Buck insisted that they could do better, and started producing multi-colored illustrated covers for the firm, and the trend was soon copied by many Midwest publishers. Among his first releases were My Creole Belle and Hiawatha. When Jerome H. Remick bought the firm he hired Gene as a staff artist. Evolving from his initial training he became adept at Art Deco even before it had recognized as an independent style. On January 23, 1905, Gene would marry his wife Henrietta in Detroit.\n\nIn early 1907 Gene temporarily lost his sight due to ulcers on his retinas, and was unable to work for several months. After three to four months his sight returned sufficiently enough for him to continue. He relocated to New York City, arriving with only $13.50 in his pocket and no firm position. It did not take him long to find work again as a free-lance cover artist, even making more contributions to his old employer. Gene took a studio next door to artist James Montgomery Flagg, who would soon be famous for the Uncle Sam \"I Want You\" poster. In addition to covers and paintings he started writing jokes and verses for comic weeklies. The bulk of his 5000 cover illustrations range from 1904 to 1914, a time when he started experiencing more permanent vision problems, making any continuation of drawing difficult at best. The 1910 census shows him in Manhattan as a \"designer\" in the music field, but he was starting a career transition. Having more or less abandoned Henrietta when he moved, she sued for divorce based on non-support and cruelty, which was granted in March 1909.\n\nStarting in 1910 Buck tried his hand at composing. Many of his earliest songs contributions were as a lyricist to the music of Dave Stamper, the accompanist at that time for Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth, appear on a series of Edison Diamond Discs from the early to mid-1910s. Gene was quite active in the New York music scene and mingled with stars of stage and screen. In 1912 he was engaged by Oscar Hammerstein to do set designs for singer Lillian Lorraine, and also directed her act, which included his co-composition Daddy Has a Sweetheart and Mother is Her Name. Originally intended for her performance in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1911, the song was rejected as the wrong material for Miss Lorraine. She left the Follies a few weeks later, and Hammerstein engaged her as well as Gene to help with her appearances in his show. Lorraine and the song subsequently became a hit, as did the follow-up, Some Boy. Gene also wrote with composers Victor Herbert and Rudolph Friml. He was also one of the founding members of ASCAP in 1914.\n\nBuck spent nearly seventeen years in the employ of Florenz Ziegfeld contributing compositions and set design for the famous Ziegfeld Follies, and even doing some directing as well. His 1918 draft registration showed him as a playwright with Ziegfeld working at the New Amsterdam Theatre. As Ziegfeld's male talent scout he was responsible for either discovering or engaging the services of stars such as Ed Wynn, Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, W.C. Fields and artist Joe Frisco. He was said to be most proud of acquiring set designer Josef Urban, a European who had been stranded when his company folded. Even though he had no English skills when hired, he became an instrumental member of the Follies, helping design and build many stunning sets. He even decorated the Buck's home in Great Neck. Gene was also responsible for originating the combination restaurant and show on the roof of the New Amsterdam, which became known as the Midnight Frolics, ultimately producing 17 editions of the revue. In 1917 he co-wrote the show Zig Zag for the London Hippodrome. In early October of 1919, Gene married again, this time to actress Helen Falconer, with whom he would remain for life.\n\nBuck continued composing into the 1920s and was the President of ASCAP (American Society of Composers and Publishers) from 1924 to 1941, playing a large role in the licensed use of music on radio. He also was known to have kept some black composers from direct involvement in ASCAP, and was admittedly surprised to find that there were objections to this mode of thinking. Buck helped ASCAP to win a major music protection case in front of the Supreme Court in 1931. During much of this time the Buck family lived in Kensington, Nassau County, New York, then in Great Neck on Long Island. The 1930 census showed Gene, his wife Helen, and their two sons, Eugene Falconer \"Gene\" (1/1925) and George William (12/1925), in Kensington, with Gene listed as a theatrical producer. Also in the house were his younger brother George, and Helen's two sisters.\n\nIn 1936 Gene and ASCAP were up in arms about proposed changes to 1909 copyright laws which, in his words, would legalize music piracy by broadcasters, hotel operators and the film industry. He already had offered some choice words for radio, saying that it could \"kill a popular song\" in just six weeks. The lobby behind the Duffy bill called ASCAP a group of \"racketeers.\" At issue was the removal of a damage clause and limit royalties to songwriters. Buck was passionate to the cause, introducing some of the \"racketeers\" at a press conference, including George Gershwin, Rudy Vallee and Ethelbert Nevin. He was further supported Deems Taylor and Oley Speaks, and publishers Carl Fischer, G. Schirmer and Irving Berlin. Florida and Washington state laws were used as a challenge to the ASCAP case, stating that the licensing was illegal. This contest ultimately went through several appeals to the Supreme Court in 1939, and ASCAP prevailed for the moment. This was followed by a challenged from N.A.B., the National Association of Broadcasters, one of the original sponsors of the Duffy bill. The Buck family was seen on a cruise passenger list in 1936 sailing from San Francisco through the Panama Canal. He was also heavily involved in ASCAP 25th anniversary concerts at two World's Fair locations in both New York and San Francisco in 1940. For the enumeration that same year taken in Kensington, he listed himself as an author. His brother George and sisters-in-law were still lodging with the family as well.\n\nBuck tried to buck BMI and their licensing practices in front of Congress in 1940 and 1941. On February 22, 1940, while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona, he was arrested on a Montana warrant that charged attempted extortion. This came from the demand by Buck and ASCAP that certain radio stations pay fees for the use of music over which the organization claimed control. He claimed that the arrest was part of a \"smearing campaign,\" thus the arrest on a Federal holiday, and was released on $10,000 bond. The suit brought by the state's attorney in Montana alleged that ASCAP was threatening to pull the licenses of radio stations and theaters that were not making substantial payments for those licenses. In turn, ASCAP was fined by the courts for $35,250. While the overall charges were later reduced, when ASCAP was threatened with litigation claiming them to be a monopoly in 1941, Gene consented to a compromise, and then stepped down from his leadership role in early 1942 after seventeen years.\n\nDespite the occasional negative press, Buck was later remembered in his ASCAP role as \"the greatest exterminator of piracy since Decatur,\" referring to the famed 19th Century naval officer Stephen Decatur. In 1940 he received the Henry Hadley Medal from the National Association of American Composers and Conductors for his efforts in advancing and protecting American music. He also became the president of the Catholic Actors Guild, a position he held through the end of his life. He was also a lifelong member of the board of directors of ASCAP. In his long career Gene was reported have had produced as many as 5000 covers, although this includes arranging photographic as well as text-based covers. He also contributed to over 500 songs. The 1950 enumeration taken in Kensington near Great Neck showed Gen and Helen hosting two of her sisters as well as Gene, Jr., and the elder Buck was listed this time as an author of \"professional theatricals.\" Gene died in Great Neck in February 1957 after an illness of two weeks. His funeral rites were presided over by former president Herbert Hoover.\n\nNotable in Buck's style is the use of minimal color palettes, often leaving many elements of the cover clear or showing a single color that would define the cover. The people were consistently drawn with succinct expressions, and the artistic elements when they appeared were well-defined although simply colored and logically patterned. Many of his covers do not bear his signature, but his distinct lettering technique on the Remick issues certainly help give them away.\n\nHarrison Crockett Henrich\n\n(August 4, 1874 to May 9, 1944) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nAlthough New York seemed to dominate the illustated sheet music cover world with its core of talented artists, Chicago had several fine contenders who did laudable work and even beyond. This particular artist, known mostly by his last name of Henrich, actually lived a much separate life after spending a decade in the world of music covers, but left his imprint behind in many Midwest publications. Those who know of his later work may have had no idea about this facet of his career, and the reverse is also true.\n\nHarrison Henrich was born in 1875 in South Bend, Indiana, to store clerk Michael Henrich, a German immigrant who had been \"born at sea,\" and his Indiana native wife, Mary Minerva Crockett. The date of August 4 was what he wrote on his WWI draft record, but some other sources show August 1, so the variance is up for grabs. One other child was born to the couple in 1879, Bessie Irene, but she died at age five. The 1880 enumeration revealed little about the family. At some point over the next decade or so, they relocated west to Chicago, Illinois, where Michael became a dry goods salesman, and Harrison attended art school, possibly with a short stay in Europe as well.\n\nThe 1900 census listed Harrison (going by Harry) as a cartoonist, and by that time he had already done a few sheet music covers, one of them a stereotyped coon song illustration that could fall into the cartoon category. There was nothing solid found to indicate that he was also drawing cartoons for a newspaper or magazine, but that is likely as some satirical cartoons from that era are still extant. Until late 1908, Henrich provided covers for the major Chicago publishers, as well as for Kansas City composer/publisher Charles L. Johnson. His work shows up primarily on works issued by Victor Kremer, Arnett Delonais and F.J.A. Forster. In 1903 Henrich formed his own small corporation with an office in downtown Chicago. By 1907 he was working from the famed Auditorium Building on Michigan Avenue in the tower section, with a shared studio space on the eleventh floor occupied by other Chicago artists. In addition to his sheet music and cartooning, Harrison had been gaining fame even beyond Illinois for his fine oil portraits, most of them of the society women of Chicago, such as Mrs. Marshall Fields, wife of the department store magnate. Eventually, one of his subjects either caught his eye or he caught hers, and it changed his direction markedly.\n\nAccording to at least some mentions from around 1909, but difficult to confirm, Henrich had a studio of some kind in Vienna, Austria. It was either there, or in Chicago that he met Carolyn Harbaugh Turner. She had recently been widowed by her wealthy husband, three decades her senior, and Harrison, nearly a decade younger than she, painted her portrait. Then he found himself staying in Los Angeles near her home in early 1909, and on March 8 eloped with his rich paramour to the south in San Diego. According to the Los Angeles Herald of March 9, 1909:\n\nClaiming the woman who was his \"artistic ideal\" as his bride, Harrison Crockett Henrich, artist and portrayer of beautiful women, this afternoon wedded Mrs. Carolyn Harbaugh Turner, wealthy widow of Los Angeles… It was to avoid the formalities of a wedding befitting the station of the bride that the trip to San Diego was made and the wedding quietly celebrated. The bride is the widow of the late W. W. D. Turner, known as the Leroi mine king, and beside her handsome home in Chester place, she inherited a fortune estimated at from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000. The groom, it is said, is also possessed of means. The couple will reside in Vienna, where Henrich has his studio, and pass their winters In Los Angeles.\n\nOvercome by a feeling of bashfulness, Henrich left his suit cases and baggage in the room he had been occupying at the Hotel Lankershim in Los Angeles and took out enough wearing apparel in his portfolio to supply his needs while on his wedding trip. At the hotel it is said that he kept constant watch on the elevator, waiting for an opportunity to get out unseen. It was a matter of general comment around the hotel that he was about to wed Mrs. Turner and it is presumed that he feared to pass through the lobby with his baggage, which would indicate that he was intending a trip for some mysterious purpose…\n\nHaving abandoned the chilly Midwest for sunny California, one of Harrison's first projects was to capture \"Types of American Beauties,\" specifically California Girls, in a series of sepia drawings, which were subsequently exhibited and published in book form before the end of the year. Such was the high regard of his work and spreading fame that when he announced a visit to San Francisco in the summer of 1910, speculation was in the air about whether he might stay there for a while, as noted in the San Francisco Call of July 17:\n\nHarrison Henrich, the Chicago sepia portrait painter, whose studies of Mrs. Marshall Field and other prominent Chicago and New York women have justly brought him no little fame, is at present in Los Angeles and will shortly leave for this city, where he will stay for a few months, and may possibly eventually open a studio. Henrich's work is already well known locally and in the southern part of the state, as he has done work for many well known Californians. His forte is portrait painting, although in eastern circles he is almost as well known for other studies. During his stay here he will in all probability hold a comprehensive exhibition of his portrait work at one of the local galleries.\n\nIn the end, Harrison remained in Los Angeles for pretty much the remainder of his life. The 1910 census showed him as a portrait artist, and there were some exhibitions of his portraiture in both Los Angeles and New York over the next decade. However, he also seemed to embrace the collective financial status of both himself and Carolyn, and curiously, for the final 1918 draft call in September, listed himself as a rancher of all things. They lived comfortably in a large white mansion at 990 S. Magnolia Avenue in Los Angeles, which was dubbed as the \"White Elephant.\" Rancher or not, Harrison was hardly done with his notable work. A profile of the artist was included in the long-running Overland Monthly in their May, 1919 edition:\n\nHARRISON CROCKETT HENRICH, the noted artist of Chicago, New York and Paris [!]… is a disciple of Sepia Art. Every touch Henrich lays on canvas is unerringly drawn, every thought he conceives is beautiful. The result is that he gives us some of the most delicate types of American beauty that have yet been produced…\n\nThere is an individuality about Henrich's work that is most appealing, it is so human. He knows how to place his forms correctly and he uses light and shade tenderly. The art-gift is an inherent quality awaiting the time for expression and development… If the house he builds is a house of cards you know it. But if it be hewn out of stone and enduringly put together, you know that the builder was a master of his craft.\n\n… Ruskin tells us that \"Greek Art and all other art is fine when it makes a man's face as like a man's face as it can.\" This is a distinctive quality in Henrich's drawings of women. He believes that all human faces should be made as like human faces as it is possible to make them. He has a tremendous energy for work and he follows out his ideals with infinite patience. His hand is strong and firm and he keeps it under absolute control so that at all times it can move with serenity and ease…\n\nThe 1920 enumeration had his occupation once again as an artist. Carolyn had generously reduced her age by a full decade to match her younger husband's 45. In addition, Harrison's parents were now residing with the couple, but both of them would die within weeks of each other before the year was out. Over the next decade Henrich produced some fine landscapes of the California and Arizona deserts, and stunning paintings of Native Americans in those settings, as well as some further north in California and Oregon. It was one painting in particular that brought him a great deal of acclaim. It was a portrait of Jesus Christ with a halo of light around his head that was widely exhibited, including at two or more world's fairs, and a century later is still in use by the Church of Latter Day Saints.\n\nThe 1930 census showed him to be an independent artist, still at work in his fifties, although he claimed to be just 51, and Carolyn 50, a full 15 years off the mark. From the early 1920s Harrison engaged in some real estate spculation, albeit with Carolyn's considerable fortune. Things did not go well in this endeavor, and by the latter part of the decade they were stuck with properties that were not moving, and very little equity to show for it. Things were made even worse by the Great Depression of the 1930s, which further depleted an already shrinking bank account. Carolyn would die at the end of 1933 at age 68. Harrison soon had to vacate the mansion due to ongoing financial duress, and it was purchased by actor Spencer Tracy, who turned it into a school for the deaf. It appears that very little work, if any, was produced by Harrison after this time. The 1940 enumeration showed him lodging in the home of Alma Norris, but with no occupation. Harrison Henrich died impoverished on May 9, 1944, 35 years and one day after his marriage to Carolyn. They are both interred at Valhalla Memorial Park in North Hollywood, California.\n\nHenrich's cover art clearly showed range and character, and some of his work clearly eclipsed that of his New York colleagues. In particular, his covers for Arnett Delonai were rich and colorful, given that the publisher was able to invest in four-color printing. One of his standouts in that regard was Fun Bob by Percy Wenrich, showing a jubilant child in a grape orchard. Indi-Ana is also stunning, with a cutout portrait of a Native American girl against a white background, both poignant and slightly sad. His caricatures of black subjects, such as Topsy and Trixy, and the highly-detailed Watermelon Trust, were less caricature (common for the time) and more about capturing the mood of those depicted. There were also some interesting variations, such as his use of pastel crayons for the cover of Sunshine, or the simple pencil sketch of Sweethearts. Among the details are his realistic use of light and shadow, which is not always present on music covers, considered by many to be outside of the realm of fine art. And yet Henrich's signature usually indicated exactly that - fine art. While not everybody may look for or see his distinctive split signature, his work still gets notice, and even more than a century later is worth a long look than most other covers, a fine legacy to have left for the world.\n\nAlbert Andrews \"Bert\" Cobb\n\n(March, 1869 to April 2, 1936) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nBert Cobb managed to leave a mark on American cartoon and sheet music cover art, as well as fine portraits of canines, while not leaving much of one on public records, making it difficult to obtain very much information on his life. He was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1869 to Ohio native Henry Zenal Cobb and his Illinois wife Sarah Johnson. The family was in the bed-spring business at that time. However, they soon moved to Wilmington, Delaware where Henry expanded into making car springs for carriages and trains. Albert had at least seven siblings, including Henry Zenal (1867), Henry Reid (1871), A. Pullman (1874), Kate (1877), and a brother born in 1880 who died in infancy. By 1900 only Albert, A. Pullman, Henry Z. and Kate were still alive. Henry Z. Cobb became an inventor, and usually lived near his younger brother.\n\nAfter being educated in Wilmington at a military school, Bert went to the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts in the late 1880s. There he learned etching and cartooning, as well as working with woodcuts and half-tone lithography. It was in cartooning that he got his start, working first at the Kansas City Star, then in Philadelphia around 1898. While there he contributed comic strips to the syndicated McClure's Sunday Section and did occasional work for the Philadelphia Sunday Press By 1900 Bert was residing in New York City and contributing humorous writings and comic caricatures to various papers through syndication, focusing largely on the New York Morning Telegraph Sunday edition. The left-handed artist also illustrated a few small books that might be considered the pulp fiction of their time.\n\nBert branched out and took on a bit of sheet music cover art jobs during this period. Most of his work covers 1900 to 1903, supporting publishers E.T. Paull and Howley, Haviland & Dresser. He is now largely known for his early \"coon song\" caricature covers for H, H & D, but Bert tackled some fine art projects as well. This includes the simple but elegant Arizona, Champagne, Broken Ties and Where the Orange Blossoms Bloom for Paull. Even though they were largely monochromatic, an unusual move for the publisher who was known for using brilliant multi-color chromolithographic covers, Bert's drawings showed amazing detail and depth. His covers were rarely seen after 1903, but a couple appear as late as 1911 under the Jerome H. Remick logo.\n\nOn February 26, 1901, Bert was married to Louise Ann McMurray in Manhattan. The following year Cobb launched a comic art and literature-based periodical called Pen and Ink which included contributions from other cartoonists, along with fellow illustrators Frank Butler and Reo Bennett. It also included contributions from Palmer Cox who was known for his Brownies characters. It did not last very long, folding within a year. The 1905 New York State census showed Bert and Louise living on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, with Bert working as an artist.\n\nOver the next several years, Cobb's cartooning work was seen in the political humor magazine Puck, as well as in the New York Globe. He had a brief court battle with the American Newspaper Syndicate in Washington, DC in 1905, winning a suit for an account due of $75 for his work. Around 1906 Cobb moved to Boston and his strips were found in the Boston Herald and the Boston Post. A 1907 syndicated strip was about a clumsy fellow named Stumble-Toe Joe. One that appeared in the Herald from 1907 to 1908 was Ambitious Teddy about a boy who was at times a bit zealous. Another good humorous example of mischievous children was a strip that ran in 1911 called Meddlesome Millie about a little girl that constantly got into trouble.\n\nDuring the mid-1910s Cobb became the official cartoonist for the Republican National Committee, responsible for all of the cartoons issued in conjunction with the presidential campaign of William Howard Taft. During World War I (the \"Great War\"), he drew a number of Liberty Loan posters in support of bonds to fund the effort. Before 1916 he had moved back to New York City where he became a member of the New York Press Club and the New York Illustrator's Club. There he did some artwork for an early rendition of Life Magazine (not the same one that started in the 1930s). Among his more interesting enterprises that did not quite launch was the intent to make animated cartoons in Rochester, New York, as noted in a 1917 article in the Rochester Democrat.\n\nMr. Cobb had not been here three days, he said yesterday afternoon when he realized that he might help in putting the city on the motion picture map, and incidentally, himself on the financial map. … Animated cartoons—pen and ink drawings that are as lifelike as, and funnier than, genuine motiong pictures—will be produced by the artist in a way that never before has been attempted. Already Mr. Cobb has been obliged to hire assistants because of the amount of work he is doing. He has two cartoonists in view now, and later, with larger quarters, he will have an office and studio staff of about fifteen persons.\n\nHis reasons for picking Rochester were due to it being the home of photographic film manufacturer Eastman Kodak. The methodology he planned to use was a stop-motion technique with cutouts. At least one catoon of a dog, Chubby's Capers, was exhibited in Rochester in March, 1917. None of these cartoons are known to exist, so are likely lost films. Certainly three years before Walt Disney started his enterprise in Kansas City, something could have come of this. But he was soon back in New York City.\n\nAround 1922 Bert married again, this time to German immigrant Elizabeth \"Lisa\" Balsie. The couple lived in the Bronx in upper New York City, but did not have children. That same year, he created a notable series of cartoons honoring \"Captains of the Automobile Industry,\" which appeared in newspapers through the United States and Canada. Cobb changed directions in his drawing career in the early 1920s, and starting in 1923 he devoted himself mostly to dry point etchings of famous dogs. Many of them were commissioned by the owners of award winning canines, and his reputation grew to the point where he was almost constantly in demand. This further resulted in multiple coast to coast gallery exhibits from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s. The most prestigious of these showings were held at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York. Cobb also compiled at least two books of his artwork published in the early 1930s, Portraits of Dogs and Hunting Dogs, in addition to doing fine illustrations for many others. He was also the unofficial cartoonist for the Republican National Committee.\n\nIn the 1930 census Bert and Elizabeth were still living in the Bronx, with Bert listed as an artist. They moved to a Cleveland Drive address in Harmon, New York, within a couple of years. In mid-March 1936 Cobb was admitted to Grasslands Hospital in nearby Valhalla with pneumonia, dying on the morning of April 2 after a ten day illness at age 66. His ashes were interred at the Cobb family vault in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 5. From that point forward, Lisa was the keeper of his memory, a veritable curator of many of his sketches. Bert's original art works, particularly his dogs, still command prices as high as the four digit range nearly a century later.\n\nLeland Stanford Morgan\n\nJune 9, 1886 to August 12, 1981) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nNamed after the famous business tycoon, railroad investor and California Senator [leaving behind a nefarious reputation], Leland Stanford Morgan would eventually become known for his artworks and teaching in the field, but his initial story did not point in that direction. He was born in 1886 California to lumber yard clerk Alvin Nelson Morgan and his wife Margaret Ann Carberry (some sources show Donnion as her last name). Although four other siblings were born during the 1880s, only one other survived, his brother George Nelson (1/22/1885). It is not clear why Alvin left Illinois for the west in the early 1880s, but even thirty years after the famed California Gold Rush had subsided, there was still plenty of opportunity for enterprising individuals. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, San Francisco directories showed Alvin working as a clerk, yardman, and even foreman of a lumber yard, as did the 1900 census taken in the city. Eventually becoming a lumber surveyor, Alvin was able for afford a moderately good education for his sons. After secondary school, Leland attended the California Business College in San Francisco, graudating in December 1903. He had also developed some skill in art, painting and sketching during those years, which helped to lead him into a career in - insurance. However, a later article from 1938 indicates the possibility that he had gone to Chicago, Illinois, for a while, looking for work that would allow him a couple of nights of training at the Art Institute there. The timeline on this is uncertain, but the 1903-1905 time frame is the best fit.\n\nSan Francisco directories from 1905 to 1909, and the 1910 Federal enumeration, all indicated that Leland was working as a bookkeeper or clerk at the insurance firm of Christensen and Goodwin. Still living with his parents and brother, it appears he soon had a change of heart in terms of pursuing his skill set, and in the 1910 San Francisco directory published mid-year, Morgan was listed as a cartoonist. The following year's directory elevated him to the status of artist. It is unclear what publications he may have been contributing to at the time, but there were plenty of newspapers and even a few magazines based in the Bay Area with which he may have done business. Around 1912 Leland migrated across the Bay, settling in Oakland, California, now working as an illustrator. In addition to the occasional book, he started providing sheet music covers in the early 1910s, largely to local publishers, although a couple of them managed to make it to New York via acquisition. The most widely-circulated of those graced the covers of two compositions by Wallie Herzer, a sometimes-composer who was also working in insurance and, in fact, at the same firm as Morgan. When the self-published The Rah-Rah Boy and Everybody Two-Step gained some circulation and the latter piece was released on records, they were both purchased by New York publisher Jerome H. Remick in 1911, including the plates and original cover. This may have encouraged Leland to continue in this field, in addition to his other illustrative pursuits.\n\nDuring the 1910s Morgan contributed covers to many Bay Area publishers, the most frequent client being Buell Music, a vanity firm run by composer Joseph Buell Carey. However, he also managed some fine work for piano manufacturer and music store Sherman, Clay & Company, Daniels and Wilson run by veteran composer Charles Neil Daniels, and Nat Goldstein Music. While he did not profess to a particular speciality, a number of the pieces with Leland's covers were exotically-themed, showing partially sillhoueted scenes from Hawaii and the Orient. In spite of his other work in California newspapers and magazines, these remaing the most widely circulated and enduring images from Morgan's hand. In early December, 1915, Leland was married to Ruth Vivian Holloway in Oakland in a secret ceremony. Family plans for a large Christmas holiday wedding were shattered and abandoned by their families after this event. Leland's June, 1917, draft record taken in Oakland showed him working as an illustrator on his own account. A notice in the Oakland Tribune of October 6, 1917, indicated that he was deployed to the army camp at American Lake, but little else was found on his service during World War I. There is a possibility he remained stateside, since some illustrations show up on 1918 publications.\n\nOnce Leland was out of the service, he decided to pursue a more stable career, possibly because most of the country's working artists were currently in the East rather than California. In 1918, he and Ruth moved southwest to Fresno, California, where he worked as an insurance adjuster. However, by 1920, he was employed as a salesman for a wholesale tire company, as indicated in some directories and the 1920 Federal census. It was in Fresno that their daughter Merle Marcella was born on November 7, 1919. Son Alan Edgar would come on April 1, 1922. While the Morgans moved back to Oakland in 1921, Leland remained in the tire and rubber business as a salesman over the next decade, while keeping his art activities to the side. The 1930 enumeration, taking at the leading edge of the Great Depression, had him in the same role. It is possible that either the tire business was less lucrative or profitable during the Depression, or that he simply wanted to go back to his first love. So that same year, Leland jumped back into a career art in a big way, as noted in this announcement from the Oakland Tribune of August 30, 1937:\n\nArt Institute of Oakland, which is now in its 16th year, was established by Elton Fox in 1921 and operated uner the name of \"Fox Art Institute and School of Commercial Art.\" Leland S. Morgan became associated with Mr. Fox in 1930 and reorganized the Fashion Art Course. The school was then called \"Fox-Morgan Art Institute and Commerical Art School.\" In 1935 Mr. Fox went to Australia and Mr. R.C. Dean became associated with school for two years. Mr. Morgan, who has been teaching Fashion Art and Commercial Art continually for the past seven years, is in complete charge of the Art Institute. Visitors Are Always Welcome. 339 15th Street.\n\nVoter registries from 1932 forward to at least 1944 also indicate Leland as a commercial artist, and the 1940 census listed him as the owner and teacher of a commercial art school. One incident from December 1938, reported in a syndicated article in national newspapers, showed his sympathy for youth who were in his position when he was young. A Jewish youth named Leopold, who had been exilied by the NAZI party in Germany, came to the United States with only his talent and a desire to draw. Morgan was exposed to his talent as an artist, and offered to give him 12 months of training for free, focusing largely on advertising art. He stated his theory that a good position was difficult to obtain without the proper training. This story obviously generated good will for Leland and his school, but only touched on the issue of Jews in NAZI Germany, most of which would come to light within seven years.\n\nRuth passed on in 1939, leaving Leland a widower. The 1940 enumeration was ambiguous as to his status (M for married is crossed out with a 7 next to it), but their chldren, both now students at the University of California Berkeley, were still residing with Leland. Around this same time he had been introduced to an Ann Arbor, Michigan, artist of some note in oils and watercolors, Alice E. Smiley, a recent divorcée. She had been caring for her ailing mother in Oakland when they met. They were married in Reno, Nevada, and moved into a new residence in Oakland after a honeymoon in Yosemite National Park. It is not certain if the union lasted, as Morgan's 1942 draft record, on which he had curiously altered his birth year to 1891, made no reference to Alice, but rather to his daughter, now Mrs. J.B. Saunders, in Berkeley. The only employment listed was Art Institute. The 1950 enumeration, taken in Oakland, showed Margon to be the proprietor of his own art school, and yet another wife, a Minnesota native named Mary E., working as a saleslady in a department store.\n\nLeland ran the Art Institute and his Morgan School of Fashion Art for several more years, then all but disappeared from view by the late 1950s. He died in Oakland in 1981 just short of age 95. Today, although his covers are less known than those from New York or Chicago publishers, they still see circulation among those in the ragtime and early popular song communities. Signing most of his covers as LE MORGAN, his work was often simple in structure, focusing more on the subject than the background, and using basic color palettes. Many of them might be considered as sillhouettes with details filled in, while others were actually relatively well-rendered landscapes. In some ways, it set apart West Coast publications from their eastern counterparts, and his work still grabs attention a century later.\n\nUnsupported>\n\nHenry Hutt\n\n(December 18, 1875 to January 19, 1950) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nHenry Hutt did not contribute very much to the art of sheet music covers, but he was responsible for a few significant ones. More than anything, his life was that of the eclectic and trouble artist, and very much a product of the excesses of the ragtime era, perhaps in part due to how public it was at times. He was born in 1875 in Chicago, Illinois, to teamster Georg Gotlieb Hutt, an immigrant from Württemberg (a 19th century Germanic kingdom), and his Russian wife, Dora Friedricke Will. Henry was preceded by his sisters Clara (1869) and Amanda (1871). Georg died in the mid-1870s, leaving Friedericke to raise their children on her own, working as a seamstress. The 1880 census showed them living in a Chicago tenement, probably just scraping along until the sisters could get better work to contribute to the family. Some of that must have gone to help Henry obtain an art education, given the propensity he showed for drawing at a young age. According to an early biography, he was mostly educated in the public schools, but spent every afternoon copying illustrations that he admired. Some of that time was spent drawing animals from life. While hard to confirm, Henry was providing professional-quality illustrations at age 14. When he was just 17-years-old, Hutt worked as an illustrator for a short-lived Chicago-based magazine called Good Form. Surviving on hard work with small Chicago publishers, Henry managed to receive a year of training in night classes at the Chicago Institue of Art in the early 1895 to 1896. While there, he was one of a group of founding members of the Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art, formed by around two-thirds of the members of the life class (painting or sculpting of models) at the Institute. According to an early story in the Inland Printer in June of 1896, the members were \"all wage-workers and busy during the week with pencil, brush or chisel, doing work to please other people.\" On Saturdays they assembled in tha Athenaeum Building in downtown Chicago to work in whatever medium stirred their fancy that week, encouraging and helping each other along. the club still exists as the Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art, the second oldest such organization in the United States.\n\nAn art editor of Mclure's Magazine took a liking to Henry's work, and engaged him to illustrate a Stephen Crane story, His Mittens. From the 1899 forward, his artwork was seen increasingly in major magazines, both as content and advertising. Before the century was out, Hutt moved to New York City where the major art centers and exhibitors were, as well as the funding for his craft. The 1900 census listed Henry as an artist living in Manhattan. That same year saw his work advertised and featured in such fine publications as The Saturday Evening Post, an earlier incarnation of Life Magazine, Ladies Home Journal, Collier's Weekly, The Century Magazine, McClures, Harper's Magazine and, most importantly and frequently, Scribner's Magazine. These were occasionally in pen and ink, but most often with partial to full color prints in wash or watercolor. Along with a few of his peers, such as Charles Dana Gibson and Harrison Fisher, Henry was known in particular for his effervescent paintings of beautiful women, to the point where they became a trend early in the decade. One in particular caught his eye, and he often referred to her as a modern-day Venus de Milo, perhaps even more beautiful. Her name was Edna Garfield Della Torre, a New York native, and from 1902 for the next several years, she would be one of his most used models. Edna and Henry were married on January 17, 1903, and their son Richard Henry was born exactly nine months later on October 17.\n\nHenry's work was now featured in books that he illustrated, newspaper inserts and articles, magazines, and advertising material, including some images for Coca-Cola. Edna was one of many models that he used, but he quite publicly made it clear that she was the ideal model and perhaps the most beautiful in America. When the topic was broached in 1907 by French artist Masson Forestler concerning American women in particular, it created a bit of rivalry among the artists who represented them on canvas. In a syndicated article printed in late October of 1907, Hutt and Harrison Fisher sounded off in a \"friendly rivalry\" in the press:\n\n\"You may talk as you like, Harrison… but after all your arguments I still hold that my model is the most beautiful woman in the world.\" And to prove it the artist produced a photograph of his wife, saying: \"Here is the most beautiful woman, not because she is my wife, but because she is truly perfect, according to the classical conception of beauty, which is above reproach and the one standard of perfection which outlasts every so-called type, that has its popularity only while its originator lives. Beauty does not live only in the brain of the idealist. It is neither a fad nor a fashion, it is a fact, as the noble outlines of the Venus de Milo prove by their time-defying loveliness.\"\n\nHutt further laid out the \"Ideal of Beauty Tabulated:\" Height—Five feet seven inches, Eyes—Dee blue, Complexion—Very fair, rose tint, Figure—Fully rounded, Hair—Curly chestnut, with god and red lights. By 1908, people across the continent were aware not only of Henry but of Edna as well, who they saw in many of his works, even if they did not know it. However, she was clearly not the only model who caught his eye. There were newspaper spreads of his artwork showing everything from how to wear hair accessories to how to properly wear the latest fashions. In 1908, The Henry Hutt Picture Book full of his sketches and paintings was released, and became a very popular Christmas gift that year, as well as a learning tool for other aspiring artists. A follow-up in 1910 was simply titled Girls, including subjects as young as a few months in its pages. And while all seemed to be going well for Henry with his thriving business, public acclaim, and beautiful wife and loving son, there were dark rumblings behind the public persona. Based on later court descriptions from his wife and others, as well as accounts in newspapers, Henry and his artist friends were apparently a rather rowdy and unseemly bunch at times. For Hutt, it is quite probable that he was an alcoholic, and apparently did more than just sketch his female subjects. He may also have been emotionally unstable, potentially bipolar, and unaware of his limits. This first manifested itself publicly on March 8, 1909, widely reported across the country:\n\nFalling on the street [Broadway] as a result of an attack of acute hysteria, Henry Hutt, the artist whose pictures and sketches of women have spread his fame from one end of the country to the other, is now lying critically ill in a hospital in this city. Hutt gained considerable fame as an artist about ten years ago. His popularity increased and at the present time he ranks well in the front with the artists of America. Hutt's illness is believed to be due to overwork. He was married in 1903, and his wife has been the model for the greater portion of his work. When taken to the hospital it was with difficulty that he was able to tell his name. He is thirty-four years of age.\n\nAs he later told it, Edna was also a perpatrator of misdeeds, and had also been abusing him physically and mentally (she was physically the size as he was). While on a visit to the Narragansett Pier in Rhode Island, while Henry was at dinner (or the gaming tables), she would excuse herself, and he would later find her in the basement in a locked room in the company of other men. When she decided to take a vacation from him for a few days to Narragansett without leaving word, he allegedly wandered about the city in a stupor looking for her in desparation, which precipitated his eventual breakdown. It was clear that there were serious issues with the Hutt union. As of the late spring 1910 enumeration, they were still residing together in Manhattan, complete with a domestic in the home. However, things would soon get ugly and created a mild sensation in the newspapers.\n\nOn January 19, 1911, it was reported that Edna brought suit against her husband for abandonment, use of \"strong liquors,\" intimacy with other women, and cruelty. She also claimed that Hnery had prevented her in some way from becoming part of the \"Four Hundred,\" the elite of New York society. Henry counter-claimed that \"Her habits of intemperance, violence and extreme cruelty constitute a perfect defense to her action.\" Her extravagant spending and a similar abadonment of the home was also an issue. In a surprising move, Richard, only seven at the time, was brought in for private testimony. He sided with his mother on the issues he was asked about. Edna made it clear to the public that she did not want Henry's son to hate his father, and encouraged their relationship, then turned around and gave him a difficult time in terms of any hope of reconciliation. By April she had been granted a legal separation and $100 per month (she had asked for $500) for support. However, the New York courts were reluctant to grant her a full divorce that year, so in January, 1912, Edna and Richard moved to Reno, Nevada, where local laws of that time required only a six month residency before obtaining the final action. In the interim, Henry reportedly suffered the scorn of the general public as well as his patrons and employers, as noted in a syndicated article from January 9, 1912:\n\nDo you remember Henry Hutt, creator of the \"Hutt Girls,\" who was kept busy not many months ago making pictures for the magazines? And do you remember Edna Garfield [Della] Torre Hutt, she whom he called his princess and used as a model and described as \"more beautiful than Venus?\" Well, he is down and out now and is suing to have his alimony reduced. He has brought to court papers to show that he has only $3.80 in cash, owes $5,000; that he is sick abed and his sister is paying the wages of his nurse. Editors no longer fight for his pictures, he says. In fact, he can't get rid of them. He has showed the court a sheaf of rejection letters—the heartbreaking kind, more often received by creators who have not yet \"arrived\" than by artists who have just been national fads.\n\nOn August 30, 1912, Edna's divorce action in Reno was denied, with the judge stating that her charges were not proven or substantiated. After a continued trial on September 16, and another one in mid-October, Edna was finally granted her final divorce. Over the next year she would nearly fade out of view, while Henry regained his footing. He also appeared in a long-running advertisement for Tuxedo Tobacco, quoted as saying \"A pipeful of Tuxedo puts new life into me.\" There was new life, and by 1915 it appears that all was either forgiven or forgotten by the public and his fans. However, the nature of his paintings had also changed. They were still taken from life, but less focused on beautiful women and more inclusive of other subjects. His main competition in that field was still Harrison Fisher, particularly for Cosmopolitan Magazine in later years. But they were both challenged by rising star Rolf Armstrong, who would soon dominate the field of female-centric art. For a brief period from 1917 to 1920, Hutt's pictures were not just seen in the papers or magazines, but issued on the covers of sheet music. Most of these were issued by publisher Leo Feist, but a couple also curiously made it onto publications put out by Vandersloot Music in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, including the waltzes Nona and Naomi by Frederick Vandersloot himself.\n\nOn his 1918 draft record, Henry indicated his sister Amanda as his point of contact, and that he was also residing with her in Manhattan. He was not readily located in the 1920 enumeration, although Edna and the children were still living in Manhattan for that record. In 1923 Henry, now 48, married a 20-year-old model named Josephine (last name not found), and moved up to the Bronx area of New York City The 1930 census revealed that he was still an portrait artist, but also doing landscapes, and that Josephine was a model for ladies wear. Little else is known of Hutt's life beyond that, and virtually no commerical artworks were identified from the late 1920s forward, so he may have worked on gallery items and commissions from that point. Hutt remained in the Bronx until his death in 1950 at age 74.\n\nHenry Hutt's overall body of illustrations, particularly of women, were not the highest form of art, but had an appeal that resonated with the general public. He was able to capture certain nuances and details of women that highlighted their charms, particularly his copious body of illustrations of his wife from the first decade of the 20th century. His sheet music covers, part of his later work, actually seemed pulled back a little from his earlier work, focusing on simplicity overall, while still exuding beauty, joy, or even heroic aspects. One of the most famous of his covers was actually drawn by an artist at Rosenbaum Studios. One of the four editions of Over There had a simple picture of marching soldiers (albeit in a Broadway stage manner), which was based on a Hutt sketch. Otherwise, they were focused on \"the girl\" and often surrounded by white, further enhancing the subject. His most complex and widely distributed cover was for The Vamp in 1920. In spite of his proclivities and at time appearing to live as a tortured and loose-moraled charcter, Hutt nonetheless provided us a window into life of the early 20th century that should still be well regarded a century and more later.\n\nUnsupported>\n\nJohn Van Buren Ranck\n\n(November 15, 1875 to November, 1965) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nKnown cryptically to sheet music collectors simply as JVR, John Van Buren Ranck was born in 1875 not far from one of the eventual sheet music publication centers, Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Whether his collective middle names were an homage to the eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren, or another family member, is unclear. He was the second of two known boys born to Pennsylvania natives Leonard Ranck and Emma Minnich, the older one being Thomas Franklin \"Frank\" (9/19/1872). They were followed by three girls, Olive Nina (11/6/1884), Mable (3/1887), and Lulu (4/1890). Both the 1880 enumeration, taken in New Columbia, Union, Pennsylvania, and the 1900 record taken in Wiliamsport, where the family had moved in 2188w, showed Leonard to be a stone mason, so an artist of sorts, given his duties were to cut and shape rocks for specific purposes.\n\nBeyond the family listings, and, of course, his artwork, there is very little available about John on a personal level. In 1895 he was listed in the Williamsport city directory as a clerk. Later in the year he lived for a brief time in Columbus, Ohio, where he was shown as a draftsman, very possibly working as an apprentice learning the trade. He also briefly worked as a cartoonist for The Philadelphia Press newspaper that year. In 1896 John was married to high school classmate May N, Young in Williamsport. Their daughter Dorothy Cavendish was born in November of 1898 according to the 1900 enumeration, but later records showed it to be 1897, and may be in error. By that time the couple had relocated to Philadelphia, where the 1900 enumeration showed him to be a plasterer, perhaps doing work similar to that of his father's but with a more malleable medium. Still, he was on his way to being an illustrator in the short run, displaying other innate skills as well.\n\nIt is unclear where John and May were the next few years, but he surfaced in 1906 in Cleveland, Ohio, working as an artist, most likely in advertising, and possibly creating sheet music art for one or more local publishers. He clearly had some interests on the side, including auto mechanics. A 1907 U.S. Patent Office listing, #322,856, showed that Ranck had created a prototype and the basic paradigm for the internal combustion rotary engine which many decades later would be fully realized in the Wankel engine used by Mazda Motors. This was no small engineering feat, and it was followed by many other renditions by other inventors, of which most referred back to the original Ranck patent.\n\nThe Rancks remained in Cleveland through mid-1909, then relocated to Brooklyn, New York. The 1910 census showed John to be the manager and one of the artists for an art or engraving firm. One of his projects that emerged in 1912 was a set of illustrations to accompany the P.G. Wodehouse book, The Prince and Betty, which had been serialized in various newspapers that same year. In 1914 John mortgaged his property so that he could form the Powers Photo Engraving Company, and then developed a new method of creating dense half-tones in photo and lithographic engravings. Patent 761,119 was issued in his name on behalf of Powers in 1913, and the process remained in use for many decades to come, with some improvements made along the way. Part of the patent read:\n\n1. The method of obtaining half-tone reproductions devoid of dots in the high lights, which comprises producing an original having high lights of pronounced low actinic value, and photographing such original through a screen onto a sensitized surface for a period of time sufficient to take such lower lights correctly and to eliminate the dots in the high lights of the negative by overexposure...\n\nMost of the work that John was doing during this time seemed to be for commercial advertising, theater posters, and similar projects. There were other aspects involved as well, since in the Brooklyn city directories of 1912 and 1913 he was listed as an editor, working for Powers at 203 Broadway. His WWI draft record, taken at the last call in September of 1918, indicated that he was now in business for himself as a working artist. It also showed that the family had relocated across the East and Hudson rivers to Mountain Lake, New Jersey, not far from Morristown. It would become their summer retreat. He would remain in that area for the rest of his life. Ranck, now 43, would soon be turning out sheet music covers, ensuring his artistic legacy.\n\nAs the music industry made the switch from the large format 10\" x 14\" sheets to the now standard 9\" x 12\" size, in part to save paper and ink during the war, Ranck started to provide covers for Fred Fisher, then for several years nearly exclusively for publisher Leo Feist. They were presented in a variety of styles from caricatures to silhouettes and portraits, most of them very clean in design, and virtually all signed with his unique three-initial circle, JVR. John was fortunate to have his designs on the covers of a number of substantial hits, some of which sold millions of copies over the years. The 1920 enumeration, taken in the couple's winter home Boonton, New Jersey, showed him simply as an illustrator, as he was also providing some artwork to magazines and newspapers.\n\nBy the late 1920s, there were few Ranck covers being freshly issued. Formatting had changed across most of the music publishing industry from elaborate illustrations to template designs in most instances that emphasized celebrity over content, and some illustrators moved to more creative venues where they could draw more than a few interpretive squiggles to surround a picture of Rudy Vallee or Bing Crosby. The 1930 census indicated that John was an illustrator primarily for magazines now, and that May had become a real-estate broker, possibly in response to the oncoming Great Depression, but also perhaps because of the riches of properties available around Mountain Lakes. The Depression did hit the music industry rather hard, so many cover artists moved on to other fields by necessity.\n\nRanck continued toying with mechanical engineering project as well, coming up with at least two interesting devices in the mid-1930s. In 1934 he patented what he called a unicycle, which was essentially a large wheel in which the driver sat within while riding. This was amplified in 1935 when another set of inventors created an early version of a unisphere riding ball that he called the toy sphere, in which the rider sat inside three wheels in different directions while remaining level as the ball moved, citing Ranck's wheel as part of the patent. While neither of these appear to have made it to market, understandable during a period when there was little disposable income, they did provide the basis for some interesting devices that were later seen in circuses or variety shows, and even some amusements intended for specialty parties. In addition, he was responsible for the syndicated comic strip Polly and Jolly, which included puzzles at the end of each installment. It ran from 1935 through 1938.\n\nThe 1940 enumeration, taken in Boonton, listed John as a commercial illustrator. It is unclear what he was doing during WWII, but it appears he took up cartooning for a while with his strip This is America, a historical and social comic on people and incidents that made the country strong. In 1949 Ranck was awarded a medal by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, for a cartoon titled To Have and To Hold. The 1950 enumeration showed him only as an artist, but now living in New York City with his wife. May died in the late 1950s, and John made it up to his 90th year before departing in November of 1965. He is buried in a family plot in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania. His many sheet music covers, an important part of his legacy, have seen increased circulation since the advent of the internet, and remain highly regarded for their artistic and communicative values, both displaying and transcending the time in which they were created.\n\nMyron Henry \"Grim\" Natwick\n\n(August 16, 1890 to October 7, 1990) Selected Covers (Hover to View)\n\nEven though he was only involved in sheet music for a few years, the collective works of Myron Natwick have been seen at some point by most everyone in the Western world, probably more than any other artist involved in sheet music cover illustrations. But that was primarily through another medium that he took to later in his life. He was born in Grand Rapids, Wisconsin (now the western suburb of Wisconsin Rapids), in 1890 to first generation Norwegian James W. Natwick and his Wisconsin-born wife Henrietta Lyon. Some sources have claimed a last name of Nordveig for Myron at birth, and for his family. However, that was the non-Anglicized name of his Norwegian immigrant grandfather Ole Nordveig. The 1870 enumeration has Natwig as the family name, and the 1880 enumeration clearly shows that the family had finally settled on Natwick more than a decade before Myron was born, which dispels that notion. Myron was the third of eight siblings, including Franklin \"Frank\" James (4/10/1887), Ruby E. (8/29/1888), Albert Guy (6/15/1892), Donald Lyon (12/9/1893), John Wesley (4/8/1895), Gladys Julia (8/26/1897), and Vernon George (4/13/1901). One other died in infancy in the early 1900s.\n\nThe 1880 and 1900 enumerations both showed James as a proprietor of a furniture store in Grand Rapids. By 1900 they were doing well enough to support the employment of two domestics. The 1905 Wisconsin census showed Frank working in the relatively new field of electrician. Myron was well-liked and quite successful while attending Lincoln High School. He was a member of both the football and track teams. At age 16 he was elected captain of the track team and held the position from his sophomore to senior years. In one statewide meet in late May of 1909, as a senior, he won the 120-yard hurdle event, then second in the 220-yard hurdle, and finally third in the discus throw, as per the Grand Rapids Tribune of June 2, 1909. His brother Frank was also quite athletic, and was reportedly one of the first track athletes from Wisconsin to be invited to an Olympiad in 1908. Myron wrote poetry, some of which won the occasional newspaper submission prize, and even appeared in school plays as an actor, in addition to being the president of his senior class. However, his true passion during high school clearly became drawing, as he relayed in an interview to the [Wisconsin Rapids] Daily Tribune published July 20, 1974:\n\nThe drawing interest was there in high school, however. According to things he's thrown out the past week, \"I did nothing else,\" but draw Natwick said. A couple boxes of his old books had sketches in them, he said. Drawing was a \"propelling feeling that I couldn't hold back,\" added Natwick.\n\nIt was also part of his personality trait that gave Myron his lifelong nickname, possibly even before high school. It had to do with his \"anything but Grim\" attitude, and from then on - at least when it came to non-classic art forms, he was known as Grim Natwick. Fresh out of high school Grim headed south to Illinois and spent some of his college training at the Art Institute of Chicago. He returned home on breaks, and his visits usually managed to make it into the Daily Tribune. While he obviously continued drawing during his college years, little if any of his work created a revenue stream. However, he made friends who worked at a music publishing company, and by 1915 had been drafted to draw covers for sheet music, which helped fund his training at the National Academy of Design. Grim turned out over 100 covers for various firms throughout the next decade, even when stationed at Camp Grant near Rockford, Illinois, during the last months of World War I. Having not gone into action, he was discharged in October 1918. In the interim, he met the love of his life in Ida Lucille Wittenberg, and they were married on July 12, 1917.\n\nIt was also in 1918 when Grim first encountered his future, albeit in a primitive form. He was hired by art school classmate Gregory LaCava at International Film Service Productions, a studio owned by William Randolph Hearst, who by then had his hands in as much media as he could. Natwick was given the opportunity to get into film animation not long after Winsor McCay had demonstrated some of his early work drawn entirely on paper, rather than the animation cells that would soon become the norm. It was a struggle at first, and he nearly quit, but when offered $100 per week to stay, a great deal in 1918, particularly considering his new matrimonial status, he finished off the frustrating task of animating a racehorse in motion. Within a short time, he turned out to be a natural at it. It is unclear if his time at Camp Grant kept him from his animator's stand outside of basic training, but with everybody pitching in, it was likely not a detriment to his position.\n\nIn early 1919, now out of the army and fully trained in several art disciplines, Natwick decided to take on what was then the graphics art center of the United States, New York City. He and Ida were found there for the January 1920 census, with Grim now working as a newspaper and animation cartoonist for the Hearst Syndicate. According to Grim concerning Hearst, \"He was insane about cartoons.\" Natwick continued to ply his increasing skill set to sheet music covers as well, which were starting to skew away from cartoonish images in some cases, and more toward realizations of the female form. If he was doing any animation in the early 1920s is unclear. To that end, after International Film Service folded, he decided to further his education abroad. Grim and Ida then sailed for Europe in 1922, where he spent much of the next three years attending the Vienna National Academy in Austria. (Some sources cite 1925 as the year, but an article in the Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune pinpoints this to February 1922.) While there Natwick spent a great deal of his study learning to drew the anatomy of women, and of the human form in general. To that end he was influenced by artists Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt. He returned to the United States in late 1924. The existence of some of his covers on sheet music published in 1924 into early 1925 helps to further codify this.\n\nSadly, part of the return was due to Ida becoming ill. She died while in Marietta, Ohio, on March 18, 1925, living Grim a widower. Over the next few months, Natwick made several appearances in his hometown doing lectures on drawing, and even displaying some of his art from his adventure in Europe. He then returned to New York City to rejoin his career as a cover artist and cartoonist, while still creating very fine art of women, including at least one outstanding music cover for the piece You're the Only One published by the house of Jerome H. Remick. He also found work in animation, this time working to produce Krazy Kat cartoons. There were two other artists there with which he would be long associated, Jimmie \"Shamus\" Culhane, and Walter Lantz. After a couple of years at that studio, Grim made a couple of major changes in his life.\n\nFirst, Natwick remarried, this time to Christine Frances Ferris, on May 21, 1929. Secondly, he had joined the quickly expanding animation studio of Max and David Fleischer. While 1928's Disney revelation, Steamboat Willie, was not the first sound cartoon produced, it is considered to be the first with a synchronized soundtrack, albeit done to the complete animation rather than before it was started. By 1929 others were jumping on what looked to be a lucrative bandwagon (the experiences of Disney Studios into the mid-1930s suggested otherwise), and the Fleischers were among them. They presented Grim with a record of singer Helen Kane singing I Wanna Be Loved By You or something similar, and asked if he could create the appropriate cartoon character that would be Kane's avatar of sorts. The character would be a girlfriend to their marquee cartoon star, Bimbo, a dog-like figure sort of loosely based on any number of anthropomorphic cartoonish human animals. In 1974 he recalled the task:\n\nGrim Natwick based Betty Boop on a \"rag time piece of music.\" He created her while working at the Max Fleischer studio in New York. He was given a piece of music sung by Helen Kane, Natwick recalls. She was \"one of these $10,000 a night singers at that time (early 1930's) because of the 'Boop-boop-a-doop' type singing,\" said Natwick. In Betty's first cartoon appearance Helen Kane provided the vocals [it was actually sound-alike Margie Hines] and Miss Boop \"did a little dance for two or three minutes.\" A little story was also woven into it, he added. Natwick said he first designed Betty \"as sort of a little round faced dog. Her ears gradually became earrings. She was saying 'Boob-boop-a doop' so of course she had to be cute. [She] wore the first mini-skirt, [and] had a cute little garter with a rose in it.\" She was designed after Helen Kane, said Natwick, who wore \"spit curls\" and was, \"kind of a pouty little singer.\"\n\nNatwick animated the first six Betty Boop cartoons which were followed by 94 more. \"She was considered to be so sexy that Hollywood banned her... locked her up for years.\" She was \"so modest\" compared to what is seen on the screen today, he added.\n\nIt was Grim'"
