        "text": "Nov. 12, 2015\n\nNEW ORLEANS - Tulane baseball has set itself up quite nicely for the 2017 season, as 11 high schoolers from eight different states signed National Letters of Intent on Wednesday and Thursday agreeing to join the Green Wave, announced the program.\n\nTulane baseball head coach David Pierce and his staff have secured the talents of Brandon Fraley (RHP/OF - Carvel Academy, Middleton, Delaware), Paul Gozzo (C- Mark T. Sheehan High School, Wallingford, Connecticut), Sal Gozzo (SS - Mark T. Sheehan High School, Wallingford, Connecticut), Kody Hoese (SS - Griffith Senior High School, Griffith, Indiana), Zach Zubia (RHP/1B - Strake Jesuit College Prep, Richmond, Texas), Jack Hogan (RHP - The Hill High School, Pottstown, Pennsylvania), Michael Kirsch (SS - Brother Martin High School, Metairie, Louisiana), Keagan Gillies (RHP - Brother Martin High School, New Orleans, La.), Jacob Cantleberry (LHP - Center Grove High School, Greenwood, Ind.), Chase Solesky (RHP - John Carroll Catholic, Fort Pierce, Florida) and Kobi Owen (OF - Episcopal High School, Bellaire, Texas) for the 2017 campaign.\n\nThe class will provide depth at all positions for the Green Wave.\n\n\"What another incredible job by our recruiting coordinator, Sean Allen, and assistant coach Philip Miller in securing 11 great players that fit the needs of the Tulane baseball program,\" stated Tulane baseball head coach David Pierce. \"Our recruiting philosophy really stands out in this class by recruiting the best players in the area and then expanding the country to complete the needs of the team. The diversified demographics of Tulane continues to be reflected through the baseball program as the 11 players come from eight different states.\"\n\nWith a junior and senior-laden squad heading into the 2016 season, the Green Wave had to recruit wisely for the future of the program.\n\n\"With a bunch of juniors on our team this year, it was tough to piece this class all together while figuring out who will still be here after the pro draft,\" stated Allen. \"We found some very athletic position players and some big physical arms that we are very excited to help develop. You always want to have a team that is strong through the middle of the field, and this class will do just that. On the mound, we have had success in the past developing big bodied right-handed pitchers and all of the right-handed pitchers in this class are exactly what we look for in a young pitcher. I really look forward to getting this group on campus.\"\n\nBelow are capsules on each player, along with quotes from Pierce and Allen.\n\nBrandon Fraley\n\nFraley (6-0, 190, R/R) is the top player out of Delaware, and ranks as the 37th-best outfielder in the nation, according to Perfect Game. He was named the Gatorade Delaware Baseball Player of the Year after his junior campaign in which he helped lead the Buccaneers and head coach Paul Niggebrugge to a 17-6 record and an appearance in the Delaware State Playoffs, one year after capturing the state title. Through the first 17 games of his junior campaign, the righty produced a 6-0 record on the mound with three saves and a 0.69 ERA while striking out 74 in just 40.0 innings. At the dish, Fraley hit .491 with a .604 slugging percentage. Prior to the season, he was named a 2015 Louisville Slugger Preseason All-American.\n\nPierce on Fraley...\n\n\"Brandon Fraley is one of the best two-way players in the country. I love his passion and confidence to be the best. He is a winner and will be fun to coach.\"\n\nAllen on Fraley...\n\n\"Brandon is a two-way player out of Delaware that was actually the Gatorade Player of the Year out of the state this past year as a junior. He has great bat speed and the best outfield throwing arm in the county. We definitely look forward to him coming in and being an immediate impact both in the outfield and as a pitcher. His makeup will make us better the second he arrives on campus. \"\n\nPaul Gozzo\n\nPaul Gozzo (6-0, 180, R/R) is regarded as the top catcher out of the state of Connecticut, as well as the fourth-best prospect regardless of position in the state while ranking as the 34th-best catcher in the nation, according to Perfect Game. He and his twin brother, Sal, helped lead Mark T. Sheehan High School to the 2015 CIAC State Title. Prior to the state playoffs, Paul Gozzo hit .400 with 23 RBI, 15 runs and two triples.\n\nPierce on Paul Gozzo...\n\n\"Paul is coming to Tulane at such an opportunistic time for a catcher. He will compete for a starting job as a freshman. Paul is regarded as a frontline catch-and-throw guy.\"\n\nAllen on Paul Gozzo...\n\n\"Paul is a catcher who is very solid all around. He's a very good catch and throw catcher. He is going to have a chance to be a physical offensive presence.\"\n\nSal Gozzo\n\nSal Gozzo (5-11, 180, S/R), the second-best shortstop out of Connecticut and the sixth-best prospect from the state according to Perfect Game. Like his brother, Paul, Sal won a state title at Mark T. Sheehan High School during his junior campaign for head coach Matt Alteri. The switch-hitter posted a .358 batting average with eight doubles and two home runs while playing stellar defense through the regular season last year. Paul and Sal's father, Mauro, pitched in the Major League's with the Blue Jays, Indians, Twins and Mets from 1989-94.\n\nPierce on Sal Gozzo...\n\n\"Sal is another kid that will be exciting to coach and watch grow. He has great athletic movement, and he may be able to play anywhere on the field.\"\n\nAllen on Sal Gozzo...\n\n\"Sal is a switch-hitting middle infielder who really understands the game. He can play shortstop and second base, and he can probably even play at third and in the outfield. He can compete every day for us.\"\n\nKody Hoese\n\nHoese (6-3, 180, R/R) is considered to be the top shortstop prospect out of the state of Indiana by Perfect Game. As a junior, Hoese hit .494 with 26 RBI, 14 doubles, one triple and two home runs while leading the Panthers and head coach Brian Jennings to an appearance in the 2014-15 IHSAA Class 3A Baseball State Tournament. Hoese has played a total of 85 games at the varsity level, and owns a career batting average of .379 with 67 RBI.\n\nPierce on Hoese...\n\n\"Kody's early commitment to Tulane was the beginning of a great class. I think Kody has the characteristics to be a superstar on and off the field.\"\n\nAllen on Hoese...\n\n\"Kody is a very long, athletic shortstop. He is a wiry-type of kid that has a lot of juice. He plays for the Indiana Bulls during the summer, and he was one of the first kids we had committed for this class. We are very excited about his future.\"\n\nZach Zubia\n\nZubia (6-4, 215, R/R) is the fifth-best third baseman to come out of Texas according to Perfect Game. As a sophomore, Zubia was named the Newcomer of the Year for District 19-6A by hitting .342 and leading head coach Raul Garcia-Rameau and the Crusaders to the state playoffs. In 2015, Zubia hit .354 with seven homers and 39 RBI while going 1-1 on the mound with a 1.80 ERA and 16 strikeouts in just 11.2 innings.\n\nPierce on Zubia...\n\n\"Zach will be a factor as a two-way player early in his baseball career at Tulane. He has plus power and throws his fastball in the low 90s. Additionally, he can play third base and first base.\"\n\nAllen on Zubia...\n\n\"Zach is another two-way player from Houston. He's a quarterback for a 6A high school in Texas, too. The future is very bright. He has a big body. He throws in the upper-80s right now and he has a very good breaking ball. He also possess a plus bat and can play first base.\"\n\nJack Hogan\n\nHogan (6-3, 225, R/R) ranks as the 17th-best right-handed pitcher out of Pennsylvania according to Perfect Game. Hogan has spent a significant amount of his childhood growing up in Singapore, but he moved to America to attend The Hill School and play baseball for head coach James Finn. He was the only underclassman to play varsity in 2014, where he won the Robins Baseball Trophy, awarded by the school to the best pitcher on the team. During that season, Hogan went 4-1 with a 1.58 ERA and 47 strikeouts in just 27.1 innings.\n\nPierce on Hogan...\n\n\"I met Jack's dad in Singapore working with the Hit Factory last December. He shared his passion for the game, and then introduced me to Jack at our camp. I liked what I saw. The kid has the size and drive to be the best he can be at Tulane.\"\n\nAllen on Hogan...\n\n\"Jack is a big, physical right-handed pitcher out of Pennsylvania who is coming off Tommy John surgery, so he won't actually throw his senior year. But we really think he will continue to develop and get better having seen him and with his body type.\"\n\nMichael Kirsch\n\nKirsch (6-1, 170, R/R) - a local product from Brother Martin High School - is considered the eighth-best second baseman out of Louisiana, according to Perfect Game. Kirsch helped lead head coach Mark Wisniewski and the Crusaders to a 24-11 overall record in 2015 alongside Gillies, another Tulane signee. Kirsch missed the middle part of his junior campaign with an injury, but he still went on to hit .305 with a .468 on-base percentage, 24 RBI, five doubles, one triple and one homer.\n\nPierce on Kirsch...\n\n\"Michael is an athletic freak. He's fast, strong and very agile. He is driven and will only get better on the baseball field with reps. I like the fact that he is a versatile ballplayer.\"\n\nAllen on Kirsch...\n\n\"Kirsch is a local kid from Brother Martin. He's probably the most athletic kid in the class. He has 6.6 speed, he can really throw and his power in his bat. He's really an all-around athlete that can play all over the field. We are really looking forward to seeing how he develops in our program.\"\n\nKeagan Gillies\n\nGillies (6-8, 230, R/R) - Kirsch's high school teammate - is the 11th-best prospect out of Louisiana, as well as the second-best right-handed pitcher from the state according to Perfect Game. As a junior, the righty went 3-1 in nine appearances, totaling 35.2 innings and posting an ERA of 3.53. Gillies also struck out 33.\n\nPierce on Gillies...\n\n\"Keagan's body type is one with great upside at 6'8\" and a lanky frame. He may develop into one of the best pitchers in the country in his class. I like his potential.\"\n\nAllen on Gillies...\n\n\"Keagan is another local, Brother Martin kid. He's 6-8. He's another kid who has a very bright future. He throws in the upper-80s now with a plus breaking ball. The sky is the limit for him once he gets a little stronger and continues to pitch.\"\n\nJacob Cantleberry\n\nSouthpaw Cantleberry (6-1, 180, R/L) ranks as the sixth-best lefty pitcher out of Indiana according to Perfect Game. Cantleberry was named the Johnson County Player of the Year as a junior while picking up All-Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference honors for head coach Keith Hatfield. He helped lead the Trojans to a 24-6 record in 2015 while winning conference, county and state sectional finals. In 64.0 innings, Cantleberry fanned 101 while posting a record of 8-1 with an 0.77 ERA.\n\nPierce on Cantleberry...\n\n\"A teammate of Kody Hoese's in the summer with the Indiana Bulls, Jacob stood out as one of the best left-handed pitchers in his class. I'm glad we got him. I like left-handed pitchers that can step in and potentially help the ball club right away. Based solely on his strikeouts last season, he has good stuff with 101 punch outs in just 64 innings.\"\n\nAllen on Cantleberry...\n\n\"Cantleberry is a power left-handed pitcher. Coach (Philip) Miller saw him late in the summer. He's one of those hidden gems that we just kind of happened to find. He throws in the upper-80s and has a plus breaking ball. He can really pitch, and we are looking forward to getting him into this program.\"\n\nChase Solesky\n\nSolesky (6-3, 200, R/R) is ranked as the 45th-best right-handed pitcher out of Florida according to Perfect Game. On the mound as a junior, Solesky went 8-4 with a 1.47 ERA in 81.0 innings, fanning 100 and allowing opponents to hit just .211 off him. Solesky also hit .279 with nine doubles in 68 at-bats while leading the Rams and head coach Andy Wells to a 16-12 record.\n\nPierce on Solesky...\n\n\"Chase has a great pitching IQ. He knows how to attack the strike zone and pitch one pitch ahead of the hitters. He has competed in one of the toughest regions in Florida, and he has done well. He should be an instant contributor for the Green Wave.\"\n\nAllen on Solesky...\n\n\"Chase logged a ton of innings this past spring out of John Carroll Catholic. He's a kid that wants the ball and is really competitive. He pounds the strike zone. He's a gamer who has quality stuff in a very good league in South Florida.\"\n\nKobi Owen\n\nOwen (6-2, 205, R/L) prepped at Episcopal High School, a high school in the Greater Houston Metro Area where Pierce coached from 1992-95. Owen earned 2015 Southwest Preparatory All-Conference honors as a junior in 2015 for head coach Matt Fox. Owen batted .411 with 30 RBI - including seven with two-outs - while swiping 11 bases as a junior.\n\nPierce on Owen...\n\n\"Kobi is a tough kid that fits into the Tulane baseball program as a student and an athlete. He loves to compete and will be a factor in the outfield as a freshman for our team.\"\n\nAllen on Owen...\n\n\"Kobi is a solid corner outfielder with a power bat. He can play centerfield, too. We feel that Kobi can be an offensive presence.\"\n\nIn addition to the signing class, Pierce announced on Thursday that he has promoted Allen to the role of Associate Head Coach. Allen is entering his 15th season of collegiate coaching, in addition to his second season with the Green Wave.\n\n\"First, let me say that I have the greatest respect and gratitude for our entire staff,\" stated Pierce. \"Coach Allen has been coaching D1 baseball for the past 15 years. He has exemplified expertise in many areas of the game, and he deserves to be recognized for it. Sean's promotion is a sign of his dedication to our University, our Athletic Department and our baseball program.\"\n\nPrior to coaching at Tulane, Allen was an assistant at Sam Houston State (2012-14), Florida International (2008-11) and Houston (2002-07). Allen - along with Philip Miller and Phil Haig - are entering their fifth-straight year with Pierce, as the trio served under him at Sam Houston State.\n\n\"With such great contribution from all of our staff members, I feel our program is definitely heading in a positive direction,\" added Pierce.\n\nSeason ticket packages and renewals for the 2016 Tulane baseball season are on sale now. The deadline to be eligible for priority seating is January 6, 2016.
