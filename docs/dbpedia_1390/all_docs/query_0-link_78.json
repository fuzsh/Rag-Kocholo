        "text": "Edward Regan Murphy was born April 3, 1961 in Brooklyn, New York, to Lillian Lynch (born: Lillian Laney), a telephone operator, and Charles Edward Murphy, a transit police officer who was also an amateur comedian and actor. After his father died, his mother married Vernon Lynch, a foreman at a Breyer's Ice Cream plant. His brothers are Charlie Murphy & Vernon Lynch Jr. Eddie had aspirations of being in show business since he was a child. A bright kid growing up in the streets of New York, Murphy spent a great deal of time on impressions and comedy stand-up routines rather than academics. His sense of humor and wit made him a stand out amongst his classmates at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. By the time he was fifteen, Murphy worked as a stand-up comic on the lower part of New York, wooing audiences with his dead-on impressions of celebrities and outlooks on life.\n\nIn the early 1980s, at the age of 19, Murphy was offered a contract for the Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time Players of Saturday Night Live (1975), where Murphy exercised his comedic abilities in impersonating African American figures and originating some of the show's most memorable characters: Velvet Jones, Mr. Robinson, and a disgruntled and angry Gumby. Murphy made his feature film debut in Nur 48 Stunden (1982), alongside Nick Nolte. The two's comedic and antagonistic chemistry, alongside Murphy's believable performance as a streetwise convict aiding a bitter, aging cop, won over critics and audiences. The next year, Murphy went two for two, with another hit, pairing him with John Landis, who later became a frequent collaborator with Murphy in Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988) and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). Beverly Hills Cop - Ich lös' den Fall auf jeden Fall (1984) was the film that made Murphy a box-office superstar and most notably made him a celebrity worldwide, and it remains one of the all-time biggest domestic blockbusters in motion-picture history. Murphy's performance as a young Detroit cop in pursuit of his friend's murderers earned him a third consecutive Golden Globe nomination. Axel Foley became one of Murphy's signature characters. On top of his game, Murphy was unfazed by his success, that is until his box office appeal and choices in scripts resulted into a spotty mix of hits and misses into the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nFilms like Auf der Suche nach dem goldenen Kind (1986) and Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) were critically panned but were still massive draws at the box office. In 1989, Murphy, coming off another hit, Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988), found failure with his directorial debut, Harlem Nights (1989). Und wieder 48 Stunden (1990), his turn as a hopeless romantic in Boomerang (1992) and as a suave vampire in Vampire In Brooklyn did little to resuscitate his career. However, his remake of Jerry Lewis's Der verrückte Professor (1996) brought Murphy's drawing power back into fruition. From there, Murphy rebounded with occasional hits and misses but has long proven himself as a skilled comedic actor with laudable range pertaining to characterizations and mannerisms. Though he has grown up a lot since his fast-lane rise as a superstar in the 1980s, Murphy has lived the Hollywood lifestyle with controversy, criticism, scandal, and the admiration of millions worldwide for his talents. As Murphy had matured throughout the years, learning many lessons about the Hollywood game in the process, he settled down with more family-oriented humor with Dr. Dolittle (1998), Mulan (1998), Bowfingers große Nummer (1999), and the animated smash Shrek - Der tollkühne Held (2001), in a supporting role that showcased Murphy's comedic personality and charm. Throughout the 2000s, he further starred in the hits Die Geistervilla (2003), Shrek 2 - Der tollkühne Held kehrt zurück (2004), Dreamgirls (2006) (for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Norbit (2007), Shrek der Dritte (2007), and Für immer Shrek (2010).\n\nMurphy was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy from 1993 to 2006. Murphy has ten children.\n\nJim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is an actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), Dumm und Dümmer (1994) and Die Maske (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.\n\nJames Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his résumé to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).\n\nCarrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.\n\nCarrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom Die Entenfabrik (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.\n\nCarrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Einmal beißen bitte (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Mein Liebhaber vom andern Stern (1988). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).\n\nFollowing his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the manic superhero movie Die Maske (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.\n\nFinally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' Dumm und Dümmer (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura - Jetzt wird's wild (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Der Dummschwätzer (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.\n\nIn 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir's Die Truman Show (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Der Mondmann (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.\n\nAn indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Ich, beide & sie (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Renée Zellweger). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard's Der Grinch (2000).\n\nAlthough Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Bruce Allmächtig (2003) and Mr. Poppers Pinguine (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Vergiss mein nicht (2004) and the drama/comedy Der Ja-Sager (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in Der unglaubliche Burt Wonderstone (2013).\n\nCarrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.\n\nDolph Lundgren was born as Hans Lundgren in Stockholm, Sweden, to Sigrid Birgitta (Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Stockholm until the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ångermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree. After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nIt was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, he had become a world-class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world's top engineering schools.\n\nHowever, that same year, he decided to move to New York City and take up acting. He changed his forename to Dolph. He started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. His film debut came in Im Angesicht des Todes (1985). However, it was his performance in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985) later that year that definitely got him noticed. After a 9-month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, he was cast opposite writer-director Sylvester Stallone, as his Russian opponent, \"Ivan Drago\". Following the success of Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985), Lundgren moved to Los Angeles and has since starred in more than 30 feature films.\n\nLundgren portrayed the classic action-heroic lead in such films as Gary Goddard's Masters of the Universe (1987), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991) co-starring Brandon Lee and Blackjack - Der Bodyguard (1998), by Hong-Kong action legend, John Woo. Lundgren has also continued to turning in memorable performances as the main adversary to other action-stars, most notably in Universal Soldier (1992) opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich, as well as Robert Longo's Vernetzt - Johnny Mnemonic (1995) opposite Keanu Reeves. In February 2004, Lundgren directed his first feature film, the thriller The Defender (2004), in which he also starred. In 2005, he directed and starred in yet another feature, The Mechanik (2005) (a.k.a \"The Mechanik\").\n\nIn January 2006, he finished principal photography of Das Ende der Götter (2006), a joint Italian/American/Spanish co-production, directed by Giulio Base, appearing opposite, among others, Daniele Liotti, Max von Sydow and F. Murray Abraham. In 2006, Lundgren starred in Diamond Dogs (2007), a Chinese/American co-production filmed on location in Mongolia. In 2007, he directed a modern day western shot in Texas, Missionary Man (2007). In 2009, he completed two new directorial efforts, the action-packed Command Performance (2009), which showcases Lundgren's longtime musical talents as a drummer; and the neo-noir thriller KGB - Killer, Gejagter, Beschützer (2010). Lundgren also reunited with co-stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone for Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and the highly anticipated action blockbuster, The Expendables (2010).\n\nLundgren managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments worldwide. In addition, he was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games. He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport. His production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or direct. He is also a founding member of \"Group of Eight\", a New York theater group started in 1994.\n\nLundgren has reportedly been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a new eponymous brand, a licensing, media and publishing program, and the development of future entertainment and media projects. Lundgren was married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion designer, until their divorce in 2011. They had two daughters together.\n\nEddie Velez was born and raised in Manhattan by Puerto Rican parents Ramon Velez and Mercedes Luciano. He graduated from the High School Of Art and Design in 1976 majoring in Advertising Art, however a course in Film Appreciation caught his attention and led him to think about a career in show business.\n\nDuring a four year stint in the U.S. Air Force, Space Division's Satellite Control Center as the Vice Commander's Administrative Aide from 1978 to 1982, Velez began his theatrical career by joining a theater group on the base with fellow military personnel called The Moffett Players performing for the sailors and airmen stationed at Moffett Field Naval Air Station in Mountain View, California. He portrayed Speed in the The Odd Couple in their inaugural production and his first lead roles as Dracula in Count Dracula and Paul Bratter in Barefoot In The Park.\n\nWhile in the military, Velez took advantage of being stationed in the theater-rich location of Northern California's Bay Area by branching out into the local theater community. He was cast as The Attendant in Bruce Jay Friedman's Steambath at the Palo Alto Playhouse and as Duke Mantee in Robert E. Sherwood's The Petrified Forest. Both shows were huge critical successes and solidified Velez' passion for acting. Dr. Doyne Mraz, the artistic director from The Los Altos Conservatory Theater, saw Velez in these plays and recruited him to perform at his theater as Nicky Holroyd in Bell, Book and Candle, and Crook-Fingered Jake in The Three Penny Opera.\n\nAfter Velez' Honorable Discharge from the Air Force as a Sergeant in 1982, he immediately moved to Hollywood and enrolled at the Estelle Harmon Actor's Workshop to further his acting aspirations. Velez' first role in Hollywood was as Xavier in the 1983 smash-hit West Coast Premier production of Lanford Wilson's Balm In Gilead at The Pan Andreas Theater in West Hollywood now known as The Coast Theater. Velez soon followed up with the role of Lenny in the critically-acclaimed World Premiere production of Delirious at the Matrix Theater in Hollywood, both plays winning the Dramalogue Award for Best Ensemble.\n\nWhether in comedy or drama, as a hero or villain, in theatre, film or television, Velez has displayed versatility as an actor throughout his career. His first television role was as a love-struck soldier in the NBC Pilot For Love And Honor in 1983. That same year he was cast in a recurring role as the shortstop Pepe Garcia in Steven Bochco's baseball series Bay City Blues for NBC.\n\nVelez went on to star as a regular in six prime-time television series starting in 1984 with NBC's night-time soap Berrenger's as Julio Morales, an up-and-coming fashion designer opposite Anita Morris and Sam Wannamaker; the CBS sitcom Charlie & Co. with Flip Wilson in 1985; NBC's The A-Team in 1986; the lead role in the CBS sitcom Trial And Error as the rookie attorney John Hernandez opposite Paul Rodriguez in 1988 (this role brought Velez a Golden Eagle Award from the Nosotros Organization and a Cesar Award from the Hispanic Achievement Society); as Officer Frankie Avila in Sonny Grosso's cop rescue drama True Blue for NBC in 1990 where he got to shoot in his beloved New York City, and as reporter Ricardo Sandoval in Live Shot, a satire on local newscasts for UPN during the network's inaugural season.\n\nVelez' other television work include several Movies of the Week, most notably starring as the infamous 'Carlos' in the NBC movie C.A.T. Squad directed by William Friedkin; the Emmy Award-winning NBC mini-series Drug Wars: The Camarena Story where he worked with Treat Williams and a very young Benicio Del Toro for the first time; Bitter Vengeance opposite Virginia Madsen; From The Files Of Joseph Wambaugh: A Jury Of One opposite John Spencer; The Presence for NBC; and as the lead Detectives in Lifetime's By Appointment Only and A Father's Choice for CBS with Peter Strauss and Mary McDonnell.\n\nVelez' numerous television guest-star appearances include Numbers, Charmed, Just Shoot Me, Profiler, Soldier Of Fortune, Gun, Jag, L.A. Firefighters, High Tide, Walker: Texas Ranger, The Commish, Flying Blind, recurring in The Trials Of Rosie O'Neill opposite Sharon Gless, Empty Nest, Midnight Caller, Shannon's Deal, Tour Of Duty, Tracy Takes On... opposite Tracy Ullman, Hill Street Blues, Cagney And Lacey, Murder, She Wrote, and in the daytime soaps Port Charles, General Hospital, Capitol and Days Of Our Lives.\n\nVelez' first feature film role was in 1983 as Napolean Rodriguez, one half of the Rodriguez Brothers in Alex Cox' cult-classic film Repo Man. Years later in 2009, Velez portrayed Judge \"Two Strikes\" Espinoza in Repo Chick, the long-awaited follow-up to Repo Man. Other film roles include the Playboy photographer in Anna Nicole; the tortured Priest Father Anthony in the horror film Born; Eric Muller, the sadistic drug lord in Albert Pyun's neo-noir crime-drama Bulletface; Reuben Alvarez in Running Woman opposite Teresa Russell; the prize-fighter Julian \"Snake\" Pedroza in the boxing drama Split Decisions starring Gene Hackman; Detective Ray Ramirez in Under Oath opposite Jack Scalia and James Russo; Detective Morales in A Passion To Kill opposite Scott Bakula; the long-lost love interest, Diego, in the romantic film Beautiful Loser opposite Cynthia Gibb; and as Lobo, the villain in Rooftops, shot in New York's Alphabet City and directed by the legendary Robert Wise.\n\nProudest career highlights include sharing scenes with Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro in Steven Soderbergh's Oscar winning film Traffic and in Paramount's action-thriller The Hunted, again directed by William Friedkin; the late great Raul Julia in the powerful and critically acclaimed Romero; Jon Voight in Most Wanted, and with the Wayans brothers in the Revolution Studio comedy hit White Chicks directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans.\n\nVelez also co-produced the highly-rated CBS Television Movie of the Week Scattered Dreams: The Kathryn Messenger Story starring Tyne Daly and Gerald McRaney, and co-wrote, produced and directed The Cross-Up, a comedy short on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nJessica Cauffiel is known for her memorable roles in films such as Legally Blonde, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, White Chicks, Hoot, Stuck On You, The World's Fastest Indian, Road Trip and Valentine, as well as popular network television series like The Drew Carey Show, My Name Is Earl, and Frasier. After a hiatus for the role of motherhood, she returns to the screen as Elle Woods' best friend Margot in the third installment of Legally Blonde.\n\nJessica is a Michigander who was born and raised in Detroit and moved in her teens to Chelsea, Michigan, the home of Jiffy Mix and Jeff Daniels' Purple Rose Theater--where her love of performance bloomed under the tutelage of life-changing, inspiring teachers. She competed in acting \"Forensics\" and won statewide tournaments and competitions in storytelling and singing.
