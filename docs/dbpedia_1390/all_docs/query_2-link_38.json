Explore our teaching philosophy and meet the educators that bring it to life every day.\n\nMr. Bracamonte Communications Manager\n\nMr. Bracamonte holds a Bachelor of Arts in Communication from San Jose State University. As the Communications Manager at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley, he thrives in his creative role, enjoying the freedom to design for all school outlets and be the storyteller of what is happening on campus.\n\nHe manages social media platforms, the school website, blogs, and the ParentSquare communication platform, and he is frequently seen around campus capturing photos and videos of students.\n\nMr. Bracamonte chose BASIS Independent for its mission to educate students to the highest international standards with a comprehensive liberal arts and sciences curriculum.

As the Dean of Students at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley, she aims to facilitate effective communication among students, parents, and teachers to maintain a positive learning environment that promotes both personal development and academic success.\n\nMs. Chan chose BASIS Independent because its holistic approach to teaching and learning aligns with her personal education philosophy, and she wanted to be part of a team dedicated to fostering a love of learning in every student. She believes every student is unique and has great potential, emphasizing the importance of developing relationships to help them realize this potential.\n\nMs. Chan holds that students learn best when they are intrinsically motivated and naturally curious, and she strives to inspire this curiosity by serving as a role model.

He also considers his time as a United States Army Medical Specialist and as an overnight homeless shelter supervisor as important, formative experiences. Mr. Diaz has been fortunate to implement the BASIS curriculum in various cultural and socioeconomic populations; he is at BASIS Independent because he believes the BASIS curriculum works. Mr. Diaz’s teaching philosophy is based around the principles of Project-Based Learning, and if he had to describe himself in three educational theories, they would be Bloom’s taxonomy, Ausubel’s subsumption theory and Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development. He keeps students busy, knowing students are capable of great ideas, and he understands his role in facilitating a student’s approach toward those great ideas. The most important aspect in the classroom is compassion. A compassionate teacher remembers the struggle of being a student and behaves accordingly.

In 2013, he worked at a private international school in Taipei, Taiwan as a teacher and later as a Curriculum Manager.

As a young person, Mr. Ferguson was homeschooled from grade 4 through high school. “There were many blessings about this, but two things stand out above the rest,” he says. “First, I was given a love for learning and exploration. Learning became something that was not just relegated to certain hours of the day, but rather something that I was passionate about and pursued in my own time. The second blessing was that I was encouraged to pursue my interests, and to explore subjects I was passionate about.” Mr. Ferguson says, “BASIS Independent Silicon Valley has a unique atmosphere where I see these two concepts (among other great things) thriving daily. Our classrooms are a place where the teachers are passionate about the subjects they are teaching, and our students are passionate about the things they are learning.” As an avid traveler, he has been all around the United States and to multiple foreign countries. “The highlight of my travels thus far was a month-long trip in the summer of 2016, to the island of Roatan, Honduras. While there, I taught English in a tiny village school, helped build the church there, and made connections with the local people that will forever impact my life and worldview,” says Mr. Ferguson. He is also a total foodie, a certified scuba diver, a speaker of Spanish and Mandarin, a choir director, a songwriter, a rock climber, and an avid DIYer.\n\nMs. Filios College Counselor\n\nMs. Filios graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a double-major in English and Communication Arts.
