ZFFCZ56B000136072 Sold for â‚¬3,910,000 inc. premium LOT 135P One owner and just over 9,500 kilometres only from new 2004 Ferrari Enzo LES GRANDES MARQUES DU MONDE Ã€ PARIS | 1 FEBRUARY 2024, 13:30 CET | PARIS, THE GRAND PALAIS Ã‰PHÃ‰MÃˆRE 2004 Ferrari Enzo Coachwork by Pininfarina Chassis no. ZFFCZ56B000136072 â€¢ One of only 12 ordered new in Nero Daytona â€¢ Believed one of only 3 examples delivered in black with a red interior â€¢ Delivered new via Charles Pozzi in France â€¢ Full Ferrari service history â€¢ Unused since its last service in 2021 â€¢ Well documented \"In 1999 we won the manufacturers' championship; in 2000 we added the drivers' championship for the first time in 21 years. We won the last championship of the 20th Century, and the first of the 21st Century. I wanted to celebrate this with a car very much like a Formula 1. After honouring Modena and Maranello, we felt this was the right car to honour the name of our founder.\" â€“ Luca di Montezemolo, President of Ferrari. Fortuitously, the Enzo's announcement in mid-summer 2002 coincided with Michael Schumacher clinching that year's Formula 1 drivers' championship for Ferrari, his third in a row for the Italian manufacturer. Indeed, the German superstar had been instrumental in the Enzo's development, contributing much valuable input to the refinement of its driving manners. Formula 1-derived technology abounded in the Enzo. Its electro-hydraulic six-speed manual transmission had already been seen in other Ferraris and was further refined, changing ratios in a lightning-fast 150 milliseconds, while the steering wheel with its plethora of buttons, lights and switches was guaranteed to make any F1 driver feel at home. Carbon brake discs had been standard F1 equipment for many years, but the Enzo's carbon-ceramic rotors represented a 'first' for a production road car. Double wishbone suspension, or variations thereof, is to be found on virtually every modern supercar, but the Enzo's incorporated pushrod-operated shock absorbers all round, just like a racing car's. In one important respect Ferrari's new sports car was superior to its F1 cousin, incorporating Skyhook adaptive suspension, a type of technology banned from the racetrack since the late 1990s. Constructed entirely from carbon fibre and Kevlar, the monocoque chassis tub was immensely stiff, a necessary requirement of the adaptive suspension. The heart of any car though, and especially of a Ferrari, is its engine; that of the Enzo being a 60-degree V12. Deploying four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, and variable length intake trumpets (the latter another Formula 1 spin-off) this 6.0-litre unit produced a mighty 660bhp. #classic #classics #classiccars #collectorcars #carcollectors #historic #vintage #performance #racing #rallying #driving #car #cars #automotiveindustry #auto #autos #autoindustry #auction #forsale #sold #automotive #investment #privatesale\n\nðŸš© Ferrariâ€™s F1 Lorry Did you know Alfa Romeo produced a 3-tonne truck from 1937 â€“ 1945? You could choose between diesel, petrol and gas. The Alfa Romeo 500 was considered to have an aerodynamic style, which Alfa refined over the few years of production. The 500 was used by the military; the Royal Italian Army, as it crusaded in Russia, with an armoured version used in the Balkan campaign. The military version was known as the 500 DR and was low-geared, allowing it to master gradients of 27%; it had a fuel range of 250 miles (even better than Tesla!). In the late 30s, the 500 operated with the Italian Fire Department. The 500 was the ideal race car transporter for Formula 1 racing teams. The Alfa Romeo Grand Prix and Scuderia Ferrari teams utilised the Alfa Romeo 500. Alfa was keen to point out that Ferrari used the early first-generation 500s, whereas they used the faster second-generation lorries. Ensuring Alfa Romeo was quicker getting to the F1, even if not when racing in the F1.\n\nClassic - the 1967 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale! Following up the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 race car from the year before, Alfa Romeo decided to take all that performance and put it in a road car. The 33 Stradale was born. Considered by many to be one of the finest and most balanced cars every built, especially for the time. Sporting a 2.0L V8 producing 251hp, with the power routed to the rear wheels via a 6-Speed Speed manual gearbox. It has a 6 second 0-60mph and an advertised top speed of 160mph (though German magazine Auto, Motor und Sport got 156.6mph in their test). Only 18 were made in total, however 5 of them were used to create concept cars from Italian coachbuilders over the years: Italdesign's Alfa Romeo Iguana designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Pininfarina's 1968 Alfa Romeo P33 Roadster, 1969 Alfa Romeo 33/2 Coupe Speciale and 1971 Alfa Romeo Cuneo (built in the same chassis as the P33 Roadster). Bertone's 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo and 1976 Alfa Romeo Navajo. #alfaromeo #33stradale #classic #performance #speed #italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ #Anis_Maaouia\n\nClassic - the 1967 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale!
