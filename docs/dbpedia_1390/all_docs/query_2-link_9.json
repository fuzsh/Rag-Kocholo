        "text": "This page lists all of the Backyard Sports characters. Fictional characters are only shown. Either visit via the imagemap above, via the links below or choose a random kid.\n\n[]\n\nLists the games broadcasters and color commentators.\n\nSunny Day[]\n\nAppears as the commentator in all Backyard Sports games up until 2009. She speaks with the voice of a broadcaster-woman. An African-American girl, she has brown hair and wears a blue vest most often.\n\nVincent Gooch[]\n\nThe first color commentator in Backyard Baseball, and the entire series as a whole. The Gooch was laid back, and spoke in a very cool manner. Despite being a fan favorite, he retired after the Backyard Baseball 2003 until Baseball 2015, replaced by Abner Dubbleplay. Voiced by Dolores Rogers.\n\nEarl Grey[]\n\nThe color commentator for Backyard Soccer games. He spoke extremely elequently. He was named after the type of tea, in true British style. Also voiced by Dolores Rogers.\n\nBarry Dejay[]\n\nAppears as the color commentator for Backyard Basketball games up until 2007. He spoke in a hip manner, constantly using lingo in games. His name is a play on the term, \"bury the J.\"\n\nBuddy Cheque[]\n\nHis name being a play on \"body check,\" Cheque was the color commentator for the Backyard Hockey games of this series. He emphasized most vowels, and spoke with a Canadian accent.\n\nChuck Downfield[]\n\nThe color commentator for Backyard Football games up until 2007. His name, as you might have guessed, is another play on words. Known for his boneheaded statements during broadcasts, seeming happily dumbfounded.\n\nEric Stream[]\n\nThe color commentator for the lone Backyard Skateboarding game. He spoke with true skater dialect and his name is a play on \"air extreme.\"\n\nThe Original Players[]\n\nThis section lists the fictional players who first appeared in the first game in 1997 and appeared in every game until 2006.\n\nPablo Ramon Sanchez[]\n\nThe best player in the game, hence his nickname, \"Secret Weapon.\" He mainly speaks Spanish (he reveals the fact that he has learned it in school), and despite him not speaking English (or does he?), unlike all the other players in the series, he plays amongst the best of his Backyard companions. Pablo Ramon Sanchez is widely agreed to be the most legendary player of the entire series. His touchdown dance in Backyard Football is also one of the most legendary things in this game, along with his backwards cap. His theme song is so iconic that it has become the walk up music for several real life MLB players.\n\nStephanie Morgan[]\n\nStephanie is a little African-American girl who is obsessed with baseball and chewing gum, which gives her her nickname of \"Bubbles.\" She talks fast and long and doesn't know when to shut up. She can be seen wearing her baseball cap and mitt in most games, including non-baseball games. She claims her father played minor-league baseball, but had to retire due to shin splints he suffered while baserunning. She can also be quite cocky, letting other kids know when they underperform. She was discontinued in 2007, but makes her return in the new mobile games in 2015.\n\nDante Robinson[]\n\nDante, nicknamed \"Stretch\", is one of the shorter players in the series. He is always energized and eats constantly. He is easily recognized by his afro and visor. He is best friends with Reese Worthington, and they keep each other entertained.\n\nKiesha Monet Phillips[]\n\nKeisha Monet \"Flash\" Phillips may be a joker, but she takes her sports seriously. She is one of the biggest, tallest, mightiest players of the series, and offers a dominating presence in a line-up in any sport.\n\nKenny Kawaguchi[]\n\nKenny is in a wheelchair and considered to be the \"cool kid\" of the group. He may be handicapped, but it doesn't stop him from trying his hardest in sports. He earned his nicknamed \"K-Man\" due to striking out many opposing hitters, as well as striking out plenty at the plate himself. He has a little sister named Vicki. He and Barry DeJay maintain a radio station, labelled KNNY. He was discontinued in 2007.\n\nVicki Fumiko Kawaguchi[]\n\nKenny's little sister. She isn't very aggressive (her nickname is \"Swan\") and mainly wears a pink tutu due to her love of ballet. She will perform any of her dancing moves in sports.\n\nAshley Raelynn Webber and Sidney Marie Webber[]\n\nThese identical twins share the nickname \"Little Smokey\", and they love to play doubles tennis with each other. Their father is a multi-millionaire who spoils his two twin daughters. Despite this, the girls are very sweet and kind, and always eager to play. Both Sidney and Ashley love to pamper their own twin Labrador Retrievers. They are much better players when playing together.\n\nDmitri Ivan Petrovich[]\n\nDmitri Ivan \"Paste\" Petrovich is a large, nerdy boy who loves technology. He almost always has a pocket protector or calculator on him while playing sports. He loves sports simply for the related games having to do with physics and mathematics.\n\nErnie Steele[]\n\nAn African-American boy who is one of the tallest Backyard Kids. He, like Kiesha, is a total joker, only he doesn't take sports so lightly. Being tall can be a burden for Steele, as he is often seen as awkward and lanky. However, this 5'6 10-year old can dominate any sport when plugged into the correct situation in the right line-up. One of his family members says he'll be a comedian when he grows up, which earned him his nickname, \"Funnybones.\" His jokes are mostly unfunny, but he's still young, so he's got some time to work on his content and delivery. Stephanie Morgan has a crush on him in the later games. His home ballpark, Steele Stadium, is featured in more Backyard Baseball games than any other ballpark. This park is noted for it's shallow centerfield. Originally voiced by Dolores Rogers\n\nKimmy Rae Eckman[]\n\nKimmy is a young red-haired girl who loves sports. She is a tough tomboy and fancies candy a lot, though it makes her hyperactive. Her best friends are Dante and Jocinda. Her nickname is \"Twinkle Toes\", and her middle name is Rae. She retired after the 2006 games. However, Kimmy Eckman makes a return in the mobile games. Reese is the only one whom she dislikes.\n\nReese Worthington[]\n\nReese is a small, frail blonde boy who is slightly nerdy. He and Dante are good friends, but Reese is disliked by certain kids for clowning around too often and being a big show-off. Worthington is based off of an original designer of the series, Richard Moe, who has asthma (just like Worthington), and was nicknamed \"Big Toe\" in grade school (also like Worthington).\n\nMikey Rhett Thomas[]\n\nNicknamed \"Nugget,\" this kid is short, stocky and looks the bit of a loner. He seems to always have a cold, which causes him to constantly pick his nose. He has good power in his bat and has a rocket for an arm, but he's an absolute liability on the basepaths. If he fails to score, he shouts, \"I'm telling my mom!\". He is not the brightest kid, as he frequently forgets the name of the game he is currently playing. He often asks the player if they are his mommy. His middle name is Rhett, after Rhett Mathis, the original programmer of the first game and music composer.\n\nRicky Alexander Johnson[]\n\nHe is a young Black boy with a melon-shaped head, hence the name of one of the custom team names in the series. He has a low self-esteem, seen in Backyard Baseball, when he would constantly break the fourth wall by, after saying things, adding, \"if that's okay with you.\" His father is a football coach, so his favorite sport shifted from soccer to football over time. His left hook was filthy on the mound, but he was a pretty darn mediocre addition to any line-up card. His middle name is Alexander and his nickname is \"Fella\".\n\nTony Gianni Delvecchio[]\n\nA boy of Italian heritage who speaks with an intimidating New York Bronx accent, \"Vec\" is somewhat arrogant about his abilities. Tony Gianni Delvecchio is also the older brother to Angela. He backs up his arrogance in Backyard Football, where he is absolutely elite on offense and defense. His crush on the Webber twins is also notable in the baseball series.\n\nAngelica (Angela) Delvecchio[]\n\nTony's younger sister. She's eight years old and still in the third grade, but she has the IQ of an 8th grader. She has two left feet, since when she was born she had one of her ankles injured. She is best known by the nicknames of \"Sugar Pop\" and \"Gelly\". She is considered a tough athlete (having grown up with four brothers) and dislikes playing alongside her brother, as she prefers paving her own path. She often pokes fun at Tony for his lack of athletic talent.\n\nJocinda Smith[]\n\nJocinda Smith is known by the nickname of \"MVP.\" She is OK in baseball, but her decent skill in basketball is what gave her this nickname. Many wouldn't tag her as the best player in the series (not really up there with Pablo, the Webbers, Kiesha or Achmed). She has four brothers and has a pet parrot. Her family owns a court that is playable in the Backyard Basketball games, called Smith Brothers Court. She was discontinued after the 2006 games.\n\nPete Wheeler[]\n\nKnown as \"Wheelie\", Pete is a long-necked boy with an oddly tall head. He is insanely stupid, but he's good at most sports due to his blazing speed. He is easily the fastest character in the series. He zones out constantly, and was held back in first grade 4 times before due to his absolute stupidity.\n\nBilly Jean Blackwood[]\n\nA tall southern girl who speaks with a Southern accent, Billy Jean has all the makings of a future Southern belle. She is the tallest kid in the league, with the exception of pro baseball player, Randy Johnson. This earned her nickname, \"Crazy Legs.\" She competed in several beauty pageants, and she dreams of moving to Paris, France and becoming a fashion model when she grows up. She despises Marky Dubois, who has a crush on her. She retired in 2007.\n\nMarky Dubois[]\n\nA redneck who does not like wearing socks or shoes. It wasn't until he began playing hockey where he finally got footwear for himself. He has a pet frog whom he carries in his pocket all the time. He has a crush on Billy Jean, who hates him, and if put on the same team, her stats will get worse will Marky's get better. His nickname is \"Cootie\".\n\nSally Dobbs[]\n\nNicknamed \"The Boss,\" she acts like a motherly figure to the younger kids, especially her younger brother Ronny, who can't stand her. Many kids dislike her due to the belief she is too bossy. She is wise, as she is the oldest player in the league (next to Tony Delvecchio). She was discontinued in 2007, along with Ronny.\n\nRonny Henry Dobbs[]\n\nThe biggest cry-baby in the game, Ronny is a short kid with skinny legs. He likes to think of himself as a big kid, even though he'll cry after underperforming or not getting his way. He can't stand his older sister, Sally, who is a bit bossy towards him. He believes she prevents him from playing well. He's nicknamed \"Spud\" because of his underwhelming height and ability. Although Ronny is one of the youngest kids at 5, he is a bit older than Dante Robinson.\n\nAchmed Khan[]\n\nNicknamed \"Axeman,\" Khan is portrayed as an easygoing kid who loves playing his air guitar and listening to rock music and EDM. He is almost always seen wearing large headphones during the games. He is typically a great athlete in whatever sport he's playing, with above-average statistics.\n\nAmir Khan[]\n\nAchmed's younger brother who also dreams of being a rocker. He likes to play the drums (earning him the nickname \"Sticks\"), as well as playing sports. If he is on the same team as Achmed, he plays better (though gets a debuff in his pitching). He looks up to Achmed, unlike several little siblings in the series, such as Angela Delvecchio and Ronny Dobbs. Amir retired in 2007, but can sometimes appear as a generic player in Backyard Baseball 2007.\n\nGretchen Hasselhoff[]\n\nA young blonde girl who likes to talk pretty fast. She can also run quickly in many games, but overall can be considered quite mediocre. She is nicknamed \"Jabberjaw\" as a result of her talkativity. She isn't very popular amongst other kids due to her being quite hyperactive.\n\nAnnie Frazier[]\n\nHer nickname is \"Flipper.\" She's a hippie who likes to play sports for the sake of being outdoors. She doesn't like to hurt others either as this was made apparent in Backyard Baseball 2005. She hosted her own ballpark, the scenic Frazier Field. The stadium's bio said that she didn't like players sliding around because it hurt the Grass Gods. Nevertheless, Frazier is a fine sleeper pick in almost all sports.\n\nJorge Raoul Louis Garcia III[]\n\nHis nickname is \"Bonkers\". A snobby rich Spanish kid who hates to get dirty, Jorge is despised by all the other kids for his attitude. He isn't an athletic type, as he is below average in almost each game. He comes from money, and makes this fact known in Backyard Hockey. The first thing he says upon clicking him is, \"I'm Jorge Garcia, and I have more money than you.\" Jorge is widely considered to be one of the worst characters in the game.\n\nLuanne Lui[]\n\nA young girl who loves carrying her teddy bear around. She believes her teddy bear is good luck, but sometimes, he gets in the way. Her nickname is \"Lulu.\" She is amongst the fastest players in the game. She is noted to be the youngest player in the entire series. She retired after 2006, but made a return in the new mobile games nearly a decade later in 2015.\n\nMaria Luna[]\n\nAlso known as \"Pinky\", Maria is a little Hispanic girl who loves the color pink. Her strength on the field is speed. Her family owns an authentic Mexican restaurant, called \"La Luna Lleno.\" Whenever she played on a team that had pink as a color, she played infinitely better.\n\nLisa Crocket[]\n\nHer nickname, \"Mad Dog,\" puzzles many players, as she isn't very aggressive, nor is she very social. She mumbles and has a dry sense of humor. She admires Dmitri Petrovich for his brain, and she also had immense raw power in all sports. However, she wasn't very agile, which hurt her overall game.\n\nCharacters Introduced in Later Games[]\n\nArthur Chen[]\n\nA Chinese-American kid. He is good friends with Achmed Khan.\n\nSamantha Pearce[]\n\nA blonde girl who loves to surf tidewaves. She is a new girl to the team .\n\nJoey MacAdoo[]\n\nOne of the best players, next to Sanchez. He thinks of himself as one of the best players, just like Tony. He looks like him, too.\n\nAce Patterson[]\n\nA military-born child, who is good at many sports, and especially loves playing football.\n\nJimmy Knuckles[]\n\nThe first villain in the Backyard Sports series, Jimmy was the leader of a group of bullies who forced the belief that victory was the only thing that mattered in baseball and took over Mellowbrook Field. However, after losing to the New Kid and the \"All-Stars\" team they formed in a match, the others surprisingly showed empathy for him, as they were simply happy to be able to play normally again, which convinced him to stop being mean to the players.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAccording to creator Nick Mirkovich, the kids are all between the ages of seven and twelve.[1] Luanne and Ronny are the youngest, at five and four years old, along with Dante Robinson to be just a little younger than Ronny, and a little older than Luanne. Sally claims to be the oldest, but this is disputed among other characters. Beginning in 2007, the characters were aged-up to being middle school students.\n\nThere are five siblings in the series: the Delvecchios (Tony and Angela), the Dobbs (Sally and Ronny), the Kawaguchis (Kenny and Vicki), the Khans (Achmed and Amir), and the Webbers (Ashley and Sidney).\n\nStarting with Backyard Baseball 2005, Vinnie the Gooch was replaced with Abner Dubbleplay. Abner was later replaced by Jack Fouler.\n\nPablo, Vicki, Dmitri, Kiesha, Tony, Ashley, Sidney, and Jorge were the only characters who appeared in every game of the series until the franchise reboot. As of now, Pablo, Tony, Sidney, and Ashley are the only Backyard Kids that never been dropped or discontinued even when the franchise rebooted. Pablo is the only child to appear as a playable character in all games."
