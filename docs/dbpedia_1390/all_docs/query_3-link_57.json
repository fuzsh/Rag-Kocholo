        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt the end of 2008, the Cuban revolution will turn 50, the so-called Special Period will turn 19 and Raúl Castro will have been in power for two and a half years, 10 months of that as President of the Council of State. This Working Paper evaluates the current status of the Cuban economy (Fidel Castro’s legacy), analyses the debate that emerged after a speech Raúl delivered on 26 July 2007 and explores the course of possible reforms. The official statistics are only from recent years, making a long-term perspective impossible. In order to evaluate economic and social performance, the author has devised statistical series that allow to compare the situation in 1989, the year before the crisis triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the later economic recovery, particularly in the period 2000-07, through macroeconomic indicators and figures on physical production, the external sector and social indices. The analysis of the debate on change identifies the key issues and draws on numerous studies by Cuban economists who live on the island. The paper is also based on articles in official newspapers, dissident writings seen on the Internet, the ‘Reflexions’ of Fidel Castro and speeches by Raúl Castro, publications by ECLAC and articles in the international press. A summary is provided of the economic measures Raúl has taken since April 2008 and the reforms he has announced are outlined, with commentary on their viability and possible impact. The paper is rounded off with conclusions and prospects.\n\nOne good thing is that since 2006, Cuban statistics are published more quickly and easier to access on the Internet (www.one.cu), but there two problems discussed in the paper:\n\nThe absence of many Cuban figures from publications by international organisations. One illustration of this is the fact that Cuba is excluded from 87% of the ECLAC series (2007b) that the organisation published in its last year report; of 23 graphs that compare Latin American countries, Cuba appears in only three –absolute and per capita rates of GDP growth, and open urban unemployment–. There are only blanks for figures on gross capital formation, net external transfers, gross foreign debt and consumer prices; these had been published in previous years. Debt as a percentage of exports has not been published since 2004.\n\nThe diminished credibility of Cuban statistics in recent years, especially macroeconomic indicators and some social statistics like unemployment; with regard to GDP and capital formation, ECLAC has introduced an exceptional measure: it publishes the official Cuban data (with a clarifying note) and adds its own estimates, but omits any figures for 2005-07 (the figures from the ECLAC office in Mexico often differ from the official Cuban numbers).\n\nEVALUATION OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STATISTICS\n\nA. Macroeconomic Indicators\n\n1. GDP Growth\n\nDue to a 35% fall in GDP after the collapse of communism, Cuba’s average growth rate was -1.4% in the period 1990-2000, the worst in all of Latin America (ECLAC, 2000). This happened despite a partial recovery since 1995 as a result of modest economic reforms in the first half of the decade. Cuban economists blame the negative growth figure on an economic deceleration from 1997-2002 (except in 2000) that stemmed from a stagnation of the reforms. In 2003 Fidel Castro launched what he called the ‘Battle of Ideas’ (one of his frequent ideological campaigns against free market economics) and did away with the reforms: he once against centralised all economic decision-making, unlinked the economy from the US dollar, created a single account at the Cuban Central Bank for depositing all foreign currencies and trimmed the country’s small private sector (Mesa-Lago & Pérez-López, 2005). Unlike Cuba’s track record of economic decline in times of anti-market re-centralisation of decision-making, official data suggest strong economic expansion since 2004, with an average annual growth rate of 10.6% in the period 2005-07 (Table 1), the largest in the region andcomparable with that of China. But the numbers are the result of a statistical manipulation (Mesa-Lago, 2005a).\n\nTable 1. Macroeconomic indicators for Cuba, 1989, 2000-07 (in percentages, except when specified\n\n(1) 1989 and GDP p/c 2000 based on 1981 prices, the rest on 1997 prices.\n\n(2) Cuban prices; ECLAC and Cuba have published sets of numbers with major differences.\n\n(3) Cuban series until 2004, later discontinued; 2005-2006 preliminary figures from ECLAC (2007a) which in previous editions (2005a, 2006a) gives a different series for 2000-2004: 34.4%, 36.6%, 37.8%, 35% and 35.4%.\n\n(4) ECLAC (2006b) raised it to 4.5%.\n\n(5) Starting in 2005 ECLAC published two series: that of Cuba and its own estimate, leaving this section blank in 2005-07.\n\nSources: Cuba CCE 1991 and ONE 2001 to 2008; ECLAC 2001 to 2007a, 2006b, 2007b.\n\nSimply changing the base year for calculating GDP at constant prices (from 1981 to 1997 since 2001) yielded a rise of 86% in per capita GDP (see Table 1) and an average annual increase of 56% in the annual value of GDP in 1989-2000, the period for which the old and new statistical series are available. Based on the old series, per capita GDP in 2000 was 7% below the 1989 level. But according to the new series it was 73% above the 1989 level. Neither the Cuban authorities nor ECLAC have explained this increase, even though they have been warned repeatedly about the problem (Mesa-Lago, 2005b).\n\nThe methodology of the UN, used internationally to measure GDP for more than 60 years and reintroduced in Cub a in the early 1990s, has been criticised in Havana on the grounds that it underestimates the country’s social achievements. In 2003 Cuba created a new methodology which added to the GDP figure the value of free social services and subsidies paid out for rationed goods.[1] That year Cuba published two GDP growth rates: 2.6% based on the conventional methodology, and 3.8%, using the new one. ECLAC’s growth rate was 2.9% (24% lower than Cuba’s inflated, official rate). In 2004 Cuba provided only a figure using the new statistical method (5.4%) while ECLAC published a rate of 3%, which was presumed to be based on the conventional methodology and was 44% lower than the official Cuban number. In 2005, Cuba’s official, inflated rate of GDP growth jumped to 11.8%, but in its report ECLAC left this space blank, with a footnote that read: ‘According to information supplied by the Cuban government, the economy grew 11.8%… calculated with a new methodology that is being analysed by ECLAC and the government of Cuba’. In 2006 Cuba reported an economic growth rate of 12.5% and for the first time ECLAC introduced two series of numbers: the Cuban figure, but only since 2001 and the figure based on the traditional method, although leaving blank the spaces for 2005 and 2006, with another footnote (‘Data supplied by the National Office of Statistics in Cuba, which are being evaluated by ECLAC’). In 2007 Cuba reported an increase of 7.5% and again ECLAC gave no figure, with a similar footnote (ECLAC, 2003b and 2007b; Table 1).[2] The GDP growth rate of 7.5% was lower than the stated goal of 10%. This disappointing performance was blamed on heavy rains that damaged construction and agriculture, high prices for imported foodstuffs and oil, and a delay in importing consumer goods. A growth rate of 8% is forecast for 2008 (Rodríguez, 2007b).\n\nThe two over-estimates we have discussed make it impossible to compare the new series of Cuban GDP data with figures from the rest of the world. If the ECLAC has been trying in vain for four years to reach agreement with Cuba to calculate the real rate of growth, it is obvious that it is impossible to resolve the problem here. But let us make a speculative exercise in correction: if the average over-estimate of GDP of 56% observed from 1989 to 2000 (resulting from changing the base year for prices from 1981 to 1997) is applied to the figure of 7.5% in 2007, this would be reduced to 4.8%. And we adjust the over-estimate stemming from the new methodology based on the ECLAC estimates in 2003-04, the growth rate goes down to 2.7% or 3.6%, both far below the regional average of 5.6% in 2007.\n\nWhatever the figure might be, the Cuban people say their living standards[3] have not improved, and Raul referred to this in a speech to the National Assembly in late 2007: ‘it is of special interest that [GDP growth] be reflected as much as possible in the domestic economy, where there are daily shortages’ (R. Castro, 2007b). But in that same assembly, the Finance and Planning Minister said: ‘Today Cuba’s GDP is perfectly comparable with that of any country in the world… and our country reiterates its right to see its achievements reflected without obstacles or ill-intended challenges, as is sought in international publications’ (Rodríguez, 2007b). Cuba has the right to calculate its GDP however it sees fit, but it cannot expect its estimates, which do not meet the accepted international standards, to be comparable to those of the rest of the world. What is more, the figures released since 2004 in Cuba are not comparable with the earlier data, which have not been recalculated with the new method (Miranda, 2008).\n\nIn 2007, 17% of GDP was generated through physical production (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, mining and manufacturing), 15% through basic services (electricity, gas, water, construction, transport, communications) and 68% through other services (trade, gastronomy, finance, administration and social services). This makes for a total of 83% in services (ONE, 2008), a major, positive transformation, especially in light of Cuba’s human capital. But a fall in physical production and food self-sufficiency, and a process of de-industrialisation, has prevented a recovery of exports, encouraged imports and generated a huge and growing trade deficit, although this is offset somewhat by exports of services. Cuban economist Monreal (2007) is worried that this might cause a ‘dysfunctional tertiarisationof the economic structure’, in other words inordinate growth of the tertiary, or service, sector.\n\n2. Capital Formation and Internal Investment\n\nEvaluating gross capital formation and investment as percentages of GDP in 1989-2007 is very difficult due to contradictions in the multiple statistics published by Cuba and ECLAC. These were complicated by changing the base year from 1981 to 1997. Gross capital formation fell from 25% to 9.2% of GDP in the period 1989-2003 and grew to 13.5% in 2006, half of what it was in 1989 (Table 1). Other data show similar declines with respect to GDP (Mesa-Lago, 2005a). According to the Cuban economist Pérez Villanueva (2006), investment has been insufficient for sustained growth, and long-term economic recovery requires rates of accumulation of capital equivalent to 25% of GDP as in the period 1975-89. The rate in Cuba in 2005 was 9.7%, the lowest in the region, which posted an average of 19.6% (ECLAC, 2007b).\n\n3. Fiscal Deficit\n\nThe fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP fell from 7.2% in 1989 to 2.1% in 2000 but it rose to 3.2% in 2007 (32 times the regional average of 0.1%), and it is forecast to grow to 3.8% in 2008. For this year it is estimated that fiscal revenue will rise 1% while expenditure will increase 2.7%; of this, 45% will go towards education, health and pensions, while 19% will be earmarked for transfers to companies and agricultural producers, including subsidies to companies that do not make a profit and products sold to the population, but only 6.6% will go towards investment. The Minister of Finance and Prices warned that ‘in order to sustain higher levels of social justice, the country must increase production of goods and services with greater efficiency and quality, including social services.… what is even more serious is for [resources] to be diverted or used to the benefit of just a few’ (Barreiro, 2007). Rodríguez (2007b) appealed for fiscal discipline in order to avert ‘deficit plans [which] conspire against an economic efficiency’.\n\n4. Inflation and the Money Supply\n\nBased on the Consumer Price Index, Cuba experienced deflation in three years in the period 2000-03, but then prices rose and inflation reached 5.7% in 2006 (there are still no figures for 2007), 11 times the figure corresponding to 1989 and higher than the regional average of 5% in 2006 (Table 1; ECLAC, 2006b). The Cuban CPI figures are dubious because the government has never released figures on the basket of goods and services used to calculate them.[4] The increase in inflation in 2006 was caused by an expansion in budgetary spending, as well as a rise in prices in free agriculture markets, public services (inter-provincial bus services, railways and domestic flights)[5] and in stores that use foreign currency (ECLAC, 2006b; Mesa-Lago, 2006). The economic adviser of the National Assembly, Osvaldo Martínez (2007), reports that food prices jumped 23.7% in 2007 and will continue to rise in 2008. The money supply (M2) in relation to GDP has grown since 2001 and reached 42.7% in 2005, the highest level since 1994 and twice the figure corresponding to 1989 (Table 1). In absolute terms, the M2 supply hit a record in 2006, with 20.874 billion pesos, 4.5 times the amount in 1989 (Pérez Villanueva, 2007a); according to ECLAC (2007a) the M2 fell to 37.9% of GDP in 2006, but it warns the figure is under-estimated because it includes only ‘national’ pesos and excludes ‘convertible’ pesos or CUC (see I-C-3).[6]\n\nB. Indicators of Physical Production\n\nFigures on physical production of 20 products that are key to the Cuban economy (both for export and domestic consumption) are shown in Table 2. In 14 of the categories, production levels in 2007 were far below those of 1989.\n\n1. Industry\n\nDuring the Special Period, Cuba has suffered through undercapitalisation, a failure to keep up to date on technologies, a severe decline in production and high dependency on imports of manufactured goods. The country has failed to regain the level of installed industrial capacity it had in 1989 (Pérez Villanueva, 2004 and 2006). The contribution of industry (mining and manufacturing) to GDP fell from 26% to 13% in the period 1989-2007 (Mesa-Lago, 2002; ONE, 2008). Mining is the sector that did best, and agriculture the worst, followed by manufacturing.\n\nOil and natural gas. Oil extraction totalled a million tons in 1986, declined by 44% in the period 1987-91, later expanded –setting a record of 3.6 million tons in 2003– but fell to 3.2 million tons in 2004 and 2.9 million in 2005 and stagnated in 2006-07. Still, it was four times the level in 1989 and three times that of 1986. Extraction of natural gas (associated in part with extraction of oil and with a plant built by Sherritt International of Canada) increased by 35 times in the period 1989-2007 with 1.215 billion cubic metres, but extraction in 1989 was tiny and in 2006 it contributed only a fourth of the combined production of oil and gas. Despite the increase in oil production, this satisfies only 35% of Cuba’s domestic needs (although this is up from 12% in 1989) and the remaining 65% is imported, mainly from Venezuela. Sugar-cane bagasse is a more important source of energy than oil, even though the former fell 67% in the period 1989-2006 because of the drop in sugar cane production; hydroelectric power makes a minimal contribution (Mesa-Lago, 2002; ONE, 2007; ECLAC, 2007a).\n\nTable 2. Production in Cuba, 1989 and 2000-07 (in thousands of metric tons, unless otherwise specified\n\n(1) Millions of cubic metres.\n\n(2) Billion Kw/h.\n\n(3) Millions of square metres.\n\n(4) Millions of units; the peak in cigars was 657,000 in 1965.\n\n(5) Millions of pairs, the record was 19 million in 1981.\n\n(6) 2000-07 includes an estimate of production in patios and urban gardens, as well as private consumption and private farms.\n\n(7) Thousands of head; the record was 7 million in 1967.\n\n(8) The record was 244,000 in 1986.\n\n(9) I million were produced in 1986.\n\n(10) The record was 1.1 million in 1985.\n\n(11) Per capita production was virtually the same.\n\n(12) A fall of 24% with respect to 2004.\n\nSources: CCE (1991), ONE (2001 to 2008); figures prior to 1989 come from Mesa-Lago (2002).\n\nDeposits in northern Cuba could contain between 4.6 and 9.3 billion barrels of oil and 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Despite more than €700 million in foreign investment and widescale drilling by joint-venture companies from Canada, Spain, Norway, India Brazil and others, there is still no confirmation of even one significant deposit, nor a single well operating with production that would be profitable and of adequate commercial quality; if such a site does materialise, it will take at least five years for production to begin (Piñón, 2008). Chávez finished an oil refinery in Cienfuegos that the Soviet Union had started to build but never completed. It came on line in December 2007, refining 65,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan crude. (Venezuela will also invest €1 billion in 2009 to boost the plant’s capacity.). But a former Chairman of the Venezuelan state-run oil company (PDVSA) said studies carried out in 2000-01 showed that this refinery was not profitable and for this reason PETROBAS and PEMEX declined to take part in the project (Sánchez, 2006); to the contrary, Triana (2007) feels that the rise in oil prices does in fact make this facility profitable.\n\nNickel. Production of nickel peaked at 76,529 tons in 2001 (with a substantial investment by Sherritt), declined to 70,948 in 2003 and jumped back up to 76,000 tons in 2007. This was 24% below the initial goal of 100,000 tons and below the record figure of 2001, but it was also 62% higher than the 1989 level. The goal for 2008 is 80,000 tons. Cuba’s three nickel plants are operating at full capacity (33,000 tons at Pedro Sotto, 33,000 tons at the Che Guevara facility and 10,000 at Ramos Latour) so new investment will be needed in order to increase production (Frank 2006, 2007). The newest of the plants is the Che Guevara one (built with Soviet technology), which consumes 18 tons of oil for each ton of nickel it produces, compared to a ratio of 12 to 1 at the Pedro Sotto plant (the most efficient one, built by the US in 1957). The new, promised investments are: (a) €200 million from Cuba itself; (b) €300 million from Sherritt to increase capacity at Pedro Sotto by 16,000 tons between 2008 and 2011; (c) €340 million by China to complete the ferrous-nickel plant in Camariocas (which will produce 22,500 tons), which was left unfinished by the Soviet Union, an agreement annulled in 2007 and replaced by one with Venezuela. But this plant also consumes a lot of energy, and would have been profitable only when the Soviet Union subsidised prices for nickel and oil; and (d) €880 million from China to exploit a nickel deposit in San Felipe which will produce 50,000 tons a year but which was also apparently abandoned in the past (Mesa-Lago, 2007).\n\nSugar. Sugar production averaged 2.5 million tons a year in the period 2000-07, less than a third of the average figure in the 1980s. The industry was restructured in 2002 due to low world prices for sugar, as well as to reduce costs, raise productivity and turn a profit; 45% of Cuba’s sugar mills were shut down, 60% of the land that had been used to grow sugarcane was shifted to other crops and 100,000 workers were laid off (Pérez-López & Álvarez, 2005). But production plummeted in the period 2003-07 and the goals set were not achieved. Agricultural output per hectare fell from 64 to 28 in the period 1989-2006, and industrial turnout from 12% to 10% in 1985-2006 (CCE, 1991; ONE, 2007). Sugar production dropped from 4 million tons in 2000 to 1.1 million in 2007 (compared with a goal of 1.6 million), down 86% from the figure in 1989 and the worst performance in 113 years. The reasons given for the failure in 2006 were these: a late start to the harvest, only 42 mills were operating (27% of those which existed in 2002) and they got a late start due to delayed repairs; less land was planted and 30% of it was overgrown with marabú (a thorny bush); there were frequent equipment breakdowns which interrupted the milling process, reduced output and raises costs (time lost was estimated at 40%); fuel shortages caused delays in transport and milling, and there was also a lack of labour incentives. After the harvest of 2006, and with their eyes set on the significant rise in world sugar prices, Fidel Castro and the Sugar Minister, General Ulises Rosales, changed Cuba’s strategy again and aimed to triple production in two years (as well as exports and revenues) through greater investment, an additional 120,000 hectares of land being planted, 51 mills in operations, importation of replacement parts, greater use of fertilisers and herbicides, and the creation of a state agency to sign agreements with foreign investors (Granma, 3/VI/2006; AFP, 27/VIII/2006). But disaster struck again in 2007. Officially it was blamed on hurricane Noel, whose torrential rains lashed the eastern provinces, flooding fields and destroying roads, bridges and railway lines. But internal failures were also reported: only 30,000 hectares of land were planted (25% of what had been planned); 47 mills began working on time but four were late. Mills were beset with frequent breakdowns, a lack of imported supplies, and low-quality machetes and gloves. Only 15% of Cuba’s provinces and 66% of the mills met the goals set for them. In 2008 the original goal of 3 million tons was scaled back to ‘a small increase’ on the 2007 figure, by planting 12% more land, using nine more mills and expanding mechanisation. But the harvest was delayed because some lands were not properly prepared, and some roads and bridges had to be rebuilt; the largest mill operated at only half its capacity as it awaited seven harvesting machines being sent from Brazil, and the third mill was closed for 10 days because of problems with a new boiler; in February, organisational problems were reported and planned imports failed to arrive. So the government announced a programme of ‘100 days of extraordinary effort and victory’ in order to boost the milling process, raise industrial output and make better use of available capacity; in late March Cuba reported an increase in production of 29% compared to 2007 (Granma, 5/II/2008 and 19/III/2008).[7] Domestic demand consumed 700,000 tons and left only 400,000 to export in export in 2007, so Cuba had to import 250,000 tons from Colombia and Brazil (Frank, 2008).\n\nMain Manufactured Goods. In 2007, production of four out of five manufactured goods that played a crucial role in Cuba’s process of industrialisation and substituting for imports were considerably below their 1989 levels: the decline was 9% in the case of steel,[8] 50% for cement, 86% for textiles and 96% for fertilisers. Production of shoes and soap for domestic use was down 75% and 59% respectively compared to the levels from 1989. Only the production of cigars –a traditional Cuban export product– rose, increasing by 38% from the 1989 level. But supplies of cigars and cigarettes for domestic consumption were reportedly 63%-75% lower than usual (Tribuna de La Habana, 18/III/2007).\n\nElectricity. Electricity generation fell by 28% in the worst period of the crisis, later recovering and remaining flat until 2006. This contradicts the empirical evidence that GDP grew at a much slower pace than did consumption of electricity. Fidel Castro declared 2006 to be the ‘Year of the Energy Revolution’ and predicted that Cuba would be an energy model for the entire world: it would churn out an additional million kilowatts, boast four times as much installed capacity; its six thermal electric plants (most of them 65 years old and wasteful) would be gradually replaced with 265 diesel engines, combined with 4,518 grupos electrógenos (small, autonomous electrical plants installed around the country and integrated into and synchronised with the national power grid; if the grid fails, the smaller plants come into action and maintain the power supply) as well as new natural gas plants; energy-inefficient domestic appliances, incandescent light bulbs and kerosene stoves would be replaced with others that save more energy; crews would replace 2 million electrical outlets, 1.5 million home-made connections, 12,400 transformers and 16,000 electrical pylons; there would be more than enough electricity, power outages would end as of 1 May and Cuba would save 1 billion pesos. Castro initially estimated the cost of the programme at €1.2 billion, but later reduced it drastically (Granma, 24 and 30/XII/2005). In early 2006 he complained that ‘the planners at the Ministry of Basic Industries and the electrical syndicate, clinging to mistaken dogmas and criteria, say the synchronisation is impossible and that the way to resolve the energy problem was to buy new thermal-electric plants. What madness!’. He also argued that the cost of just one thermal-electric plant was €350 million and that with that much money Cuba could buy all the grupos electrógenos it needed (Castro, 2006).\n\nGeneration of electricity rose and hit a record in 2007, surpassing the 1989 level by 13%, although on a per capita basis it remained unchanged. But some serious defects in the new energy programme have been identified: it is a short-term remedy but not a long-term solution because the aging thermal electric plants (damaged by use of heavy crude with a high sulphur content) deteriorate more and more. They will eventually break down, shift more responsibility on the small autonomous units mentioned above. These will turn out to be insufficient and the entire system will collapse. The small autonomous units require frequent maintenance; the diesel fuel needed by these units spread all over the island needs to be transported by a fleet of trucks, and diesel is more expensive than oil. And more and more diesel will be used as the autonomous units operate more and more; new electric stoves and appliances will use more energy, and if the electrical grid fails, food will spoil and cannot be cooked. The government will not be able to recover the cost of a quarter of the new appliances sold to the population for €300 million. Electrical conduits and structures are stolen frequently (2,094 in 2005 alone) and similar robbery can happen with the grupos electrógenos, the small autonomous electrical generators (Trabajadores, 15/V/2007; Mesa-Lago, 2007).\n\nThe Minister for Basic Industry, Yadira García, said Fidel Castro’s promise to do away with power outages had been kept and Minister Rodríguez said blackouts in 2007 were down 87.5% in 2007 compared with 2005. But only a third of the smaller units have been installed, voltage at peak hours declines noticeably, transformers have exploded and in mid 2006 and early 2007 power outages were reported in Havana, Matanzas and Pinar del Río (Mesa-Lago, 2007). Evaluating 18 months of ‘Energy Revolution’, vice president Carlos Lage acknowledged that 1.2 billion tons of diesel fuel are consumed at a very high cost, fuel supplies are still vulnerable, electricity consumption might be cut and savings are insufficient (Juventud Rebelde, 4/VI/2007). A state-approved journalist said it is still premature to evaluate the overall impact of the energy-saving programme, its cost and the quality of service; outages are still frequent (91% of them happen on secondary circuits and in homes where the plan has already been implemented). Crews still have to install intake cables in 2.3 million homes, replace tens of thousands of kilometres of conduits, build 45% of the substations that are planned, 63% of the secondary circuits, 41% of the transformers, 48% of the electrical pylons, 53% of the breakers and 50% of the meters. The number of areas suffering from low voltage has increased recently due to aging and deterioration of the central grid and the installation of new equipment in state agencies and officials’ homes. This is a problem because many families now depend on electricity to refrigerate and cook food (Mayoral, 2007).\n\n2. Transport\n\nThe number of passengers transported fell 84% in the period 1986-95 (from 3.2 million to 533,800) and even though it rose to 1.6 million in 2007 this was only half the figure corresponding to 1986. Furthermore, only 43% were transported ‘by traditional means’, with the rest doing so by ‘alternative means’ such as animals or on their own (Pérez Villanueva, 2007a; ONE, 2008). As of late 2007 Cuba had received 806 of 8,000 buses it planned to get from China; there were only 395 more public buses working than in 2006 and the number of passengers carried rose 5%, while rail passengers declined 4% and airline passengers by 14% (Granma, 28/XII/2007; ONE, 2008). The Transport Minister says the accumulated deficit is so great that the situation has not improved with the import of buses, equipment is not maintained properly and workers have not been trained to use it (AFP, Havana, 17/III/2007). There are also frequent attacks of vandalism against vehicles, and junk yards of buses have sprung up with vehicles damaged in accidents or idled because of a lack of spare parts.\n\n3. Agriculture\n\nIn 2007, 19.6% of Cuba’s workforce was involved in agriculture and fishing but generated only 4.2% of GDP, making their productivity extremely low (ONE, 2008). Production of agriculture, livestock and fisheries fell 11.6% in 2005 and 6% in 2006 but reportedly increased 23.4% in 2007.[9] However, the period 2006-07 production of five important items was far below the 1989 level: the decline was 12% for eggs, 18% for rice (75% of it is imported, 33% for leaf tobacco (in contrast with the increase in production of cigars), 56% for citrus fruits (this used to be a major export product) and 57% for cow’s milk. The number of head of cattle raised, which in 1967 was 7 million, fell relentlessly to 4.9 million in 1989 and 3.7 million in 2006, a decrease of 24% from the 1989 level and 47% below the level corresponding to 1967; the number of head per capita fell from 0.83 to 0.33 in the period 1989-2006, which explains the drastic decline in production of meat and milk (Mesa-Lago, 2007). The coffee harvest in the period 2007-08 was 4,400 tons, down 85% from 1989 (Granma, 12/III/2008). On the other hand, production of tubers rose and peaked in 2004, but it fell in the period 2005-07; in the last year it was 117% higher than the 1989 level but 24% below 2004. Production of vegetables and beans in 2007 was six and four times, respectively, that of 1989. However, this production and that of tubers is over-estimated because since 2000 it has included ‘an estimate of production in patios and plots of land and for home consumption… among private cooperatives and farmers’ (ECLAC, 2007a).\n\nThe government has traditionally blamed poor agricultural production on external factors such as the US trade embargo and the weather: (1) imports of feed for cattle and poultry fell 52% in the period 1989-2000 and hurt production of meat and dairy products, but have risen since 2002 thanks to purchases from the US; (2) three hurricanes in 2005 (Dennis, Katrina and Wilma) caused severe losses, particularly in citrus fruits, tobacco, coffee and poultry. But even though there was no hurricane and rainfall was adequate in 2006, agricultural production fell; (3) severe drought in 2004-05 triggered 1 billion pesos in losses; and (4) copious rains in 2007 damaged the sugarcane harvest. We have already analysed the internal factors that contributed to this problem.\n\nHowever, a series of articles published in Cuba in 2006-07 identify systemic causes of the fall in agricultural production. First, despite the agricultural reforms of 1993, the structure land use and property is still inefficient and lacking in incentives: 55% of land is still owned by state companies; another 26% are old state-run forms that were transformed into Basic Units of Cooperative Production (UBPC), but they inherited debts and obsolete equipment from the State, their members were not consulted or trained when the transformation took place and they continue to behave like government employees (they do not feel like owners), the government directs production with little input from the members and buys virtually all of their production below market prices, and sales to free agricultural markets have price caps and amount to only 3.5% of total sales in those markets; only 44% of the cooperatives are profitable and the rest need government subsidies;[10] another 6.3% of the land is designated as Agriculture and Livestock Production Cooperatives (CPA), whose numbers have declined under the burden of debts and lack of profits. Another 8.2% of Cuba’s land is held by Credit and Service Cooperatives (CCS), these are also under tight state control and lack tractors or have broken equipment. The remaining 4.5% of the land is used by private farmers who produce two-thirds of Cuba’s foodstuffs and post higher productivity than the state-held land and the UBPC (overall agricultural output is below the world average, except in two crops). In the second place, the state system of forced purchases (the so-called Acopio) is a monopoly which works as an intermediary that ‘buys cheap and sells expensive’[11] and suffers from serious problems: (a) it extracts an average gain of 29% and as much as 41% of low-quality bananas are bought from producers and sold as top-quality to retailers; (b) it delays payments to producers, running up huge debts; (c) it sets prices in a rigid way through provincial councils, has scant information on inventories and demand, and does not lower prices even when the product is of low quality and does not sell and thus ends up rotting (an expert has to decide whether to lower prices but often there is no telephone with which to call and when the product arrives it has already spoiled); (d) it had inadequate storage facilities and scales, as well as aging transport equipment, part of which is broken down or lacks gasoline, batteries, tires, etc; and (e) provides producers with only small amounts of supplies (fertiliser, seeds, fuel, machetes, boots and gloves) which are totally insufficient for them to meet production goals. Thirdly, substantial losses are sustained because of organisational problems; for instance, millions of litres of milk spoiled in 2007 due to delays in pickup, a shortage of bottles, insufficient controls and an exodus of experienced dairy workers. In the fourth place, 39% of land that had been used to grow sugarcane and was supposed to be transferred to food production is idle and covered with marabú; furthermore, irrigation systems became undercapitalised (Borrego, 2006; González, 2006; Nova, 2006, 2007; Pagés & Castaño, 2006; Martín & Pérez, 2007; ONE, 2007).\n\nFish and Shellfish. Catches totalled 244,000 tons in 1986, fell to 192,000 in 1989 and then to 61,199 in 2007, a decrease of 68% from the 1989 level and 75% compared with 1986 (there was an increase in 2007 due mainly to production at fish farms, but a big drop in prawn catches). The Cuban fishing fleet is decrepit and saddled with a high debt, a lack of liquidity, low credibility among creditors, technological problems, high oil prices, damage from hurricanes and the energy crisis. In late 2006, the European Commission said it found deficiencies and insufficient protection against contaminants in Cuban fishing products and asked the government to improve its sanitary controls (EFE, Brussels, 24/XI/2006).\n\nC. Foreign Sector Indicators\n\nForeign sector indicators are seen in Table 3 but their availability has declined in recent years; the last complete figures on trade in goods were published in 2004; figures on exports of nickel were no long released starting in 2002; complete figures on the balance of payments were suspended in 2001 and there are only partial data for 2005-06 and nothing for 2007; figures on direct foreign investment stopped being published in 2001 (ONE, 2006, 2007, 2008). The ECLAC figures on the balance of payments are incomplete and contradictory, and there are also problems with figures on terms of trade.\n\nTable 3. Foreign sector indicators, 1989 and 2000-07 (in billions of pesos, unless otherwise specified)\n\n(1) US$ billion.\n\n(2) Compared with 2002.\n\nSource: Cuba CCE (1991), ONE (2001 to 2008); ECLAC (2000a to 2007a, 2006b, 2007b); number of foreign businesses from Pérez Villanueva (2007b); 2007 debt from ICCAS (2008) (excludes debt owed to Venezuela).\n\n1. Trade Balance in Goods\n\nThe value of exports of good plummeted during the crisis and remained flat in the period 2000-03. Later it grew, but in 2007 it was still 31% below the level corresponding to 1989 (as a percentage of GDP, exports fell from 27.5% to 8% in 1989-2007). On the other hand, the value of imports of goods rose much more quickly and in 2007 was at 25% of the 1989 figure.[12] The deficit in trade in goods hit successive records, peaking at US$6.598 billion in 2006 and although it fell slightly to US$6.381 billion in 2007 (€4.710 and €4.400 billion) it was still at 137% of the 1989 figure. These figures confirm the traditional weakness of Cuba’s foreign sector, which after 18 years of economic transformations has still not achieved equilibrium in its trade balance in goods. Plus, Cuba no longer receives the long-term loans at very low interest rates that the Soviet Union used to provide automatically to cover its annual trade deficit and which Cuba has not paid back. Marquetti (in Pérez Villanueva, 2004) says that in order to regain the 1989 level, Cuban exports would have to grow at an annual rate of 20%-30% in the space of five years, which is unlikely given past economic performance, growth forecasts for 2010 and structural factors that are difficult to correct.[13]\n\n2. Terms of Trade\n\nTaking 1989 as a base year, ECLAC estimates a 55.6% decline in Cuba’s terms of trade in 2004; it later changed the base year to 2000 and the decline in terms of trade in 2004 was reduced to 4.7%; in its last report and with the same 2000 base year, the decline turned into an increase of 33% in 2004 and of 60.8% in 2006 (ECLAC, 2000a to 2007a). In 2004, rising prices for oil and imported foodstuffs were not offset by increases in the price of nickel, while sugar prices remained relatively low, so this increase of 33% in questionable. But this situation began to change in 2005 because under economic and trade accords with Chávez, Cuba started to receive substantial subsidies; for instance Venezuela sends Cuba 100,000 barrels of oil a day at a preferential price of US$27 while the average world price per barrel was US$65 in 2006 and US$75 dollars in 2007. So the subsidy Cuba received was worth US$2.5 billion in 2007 (€1.700 billion).[14] Furthermore, the price of nickel shot up in that period, and sugar prices also rose, although Cuba could not take advantage of this because of its very poor harvests. The main negative factor is the increase in the price of foods that Cuba imported to the tune of €1.2 billion in 2007, an increase of 27% over 2006 due to higher prices rather than volumes (AFP, Havana, 31/XII/2007). Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Cuba’s terms of trade have improved.\n\n3. Composition of Cuban Trade\n\nSugar’s contribution to the value of Cuba’s total exports fell constantly in the period 1989-2006, from 73% to 8%, due to a drastic fall in the volume exported despite the recent rise in world prices for this commodity. The value of nickel exports is no longer published separately, just total mineral exports (of which nickel is the main component). This contribution rose from 35% to 48% in the period 2003-06, mainly due to the rise in world prices for nickel, since in Cuba its production and exportation remained flat. The contributions from other traditional exports declined in the period 2003-06: tobacco from 12.8% to 8.6%, fish and shellfish from 8.1% to 2.3% and citrus fruits from 0.6% to 0.2%. The share of a non-traditional export product, pharmaceuticals, rose from 3.6% to 5.9% while that of cement fell from 2% to 1.4%[15] (ONE, 2007). Cuba claims substantial growth in biotechnology exports, but the Anuario Estadístico de Cuba does not publish those figures. According to Monreal (2004), in the early 1990s Cuba predicted that the biotechnology industry would become a leader of its export sector, but in recent years expectations to this effect have been toned down considerably. Pérez Villanueva (2006) says exports of chemical pharmaceutical products has fallen since 1995 and are still far from the potential they held in 1989, except in the area of vaccines. Despite changes in the breakdown of Cuba’s exports, in 2006 68% of them were traditional raw materials that are typical of developing countries (nickel, sugar, tobacco, fish and fruit), while only a minority were finished or semi-finished products.\n\nThere were important changes in the make-up of Cuba’s imports in the period 1989-2006. Foodstuffs’ share rose from 13% to 14% (due to the fall in domestic production) and that of manufactured goods from 14% to 20% (due to de-industrialisation); on the other hand, the share corresponding to fuels fell from 32% to 24% (thanks to the subsidised Venezuelan oil), that of chemical products from 10% to 7%; that of machinery and transport equipment went from 31% to 24% in the period 1989-2005 but rose to 32% in 2006 through the purchase of diesel generators and buses (CCE, 1991; ONE, 2007). Poor agricultural output has made necessary massive imports of food and fattened the Budget deficit and the trade balance. Cuba imports 84% of the food in its basic consumer basket (the most important sector after oil): 58% of the calories, 62% of proteins, 43% of animal origin and 71% of vegetable origin (Granma, 26/II/2007; Nova, 2007). Pérez Villanueva (2004, 2006) says food, fuel and medicines have continued to account for more than 60% of total imports and eat up 80% of the foreign currency Cuba takes in, ‘with no possibility of changing this situation over the short term’.\n\n4. Trading Partners\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet bloc, Cuba diversified its trade links considerably. In 2006, its main trading partners and their share of Cuba’s overseas trade were as follows: Venezuela 26.4% (excluding exports of services), China 14.9%, Spain 8.2%, Canada 7.3%, the Netherlands 6.9%, Germany 5.5%, the US 4%, Brazil and Italy 3% each, Russia 2.4% (compared with 65% with the Soviet Union in 1989) and France 2% (ONE, 2007; figures corresponding to 2007 were not available in March 2008). Venezuela and China together accounted for 41% of Cuba’s total overseas trade, while the shares of the rest of the countries declined in 2006.\n\nVenezuela is Cuba’s main trading partner (a 30% increase is reported in 2007) and it plays the role of major subsidy-provider that the Soviet Union did in the period 1960-2000. Through numerous trade and economic accords signed with Cuba in the period 2004-07, Venezuela has committed around €3 billion: more than €1 billion to complete 335 projects that include oil exploration and drilling, the laying of an undersea cable between the two countries, the building and repair of ports and ships, three hotels with a total of 2,872 rooms, the supplying of communications and railway equipment; €500 million in the Camariocas ferrous-nickel plant; some €450 million in the Cienfuegos oil refinery; at least €200 million in agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure; €68 million en housing construction; and unspecified amounts to build a thermal-electric plant in Mariel, as well as a joint venture company with Cuba and China to produce stainless steel, and subsidise trips by 100,000 Venezuelan tourists each year to Cuba (Mesa-Lago, 2007). Before Chávez lost a referendum in December 2007 on broadening his powers, Fidel Castro warned that such a defeat would bring disastrous consequences for Cuba. To avert a repeat of the devastating impact of the collapse of the Soviet Union and a second Special Period, Raúl Castro has sought other trading partners: Angola, Azerbaijan, Equatorial Guinea and Iran as suppliers of oil (and loans from Iran); Brazil granted €670 million in credit and investment in 2008; and Mexico rescheduled €280 million in Cuban debt with Bancomex (15 years with a five-year grace period and 6% interest rate) and granted €16 million in credit to boost trade that had fallen by one half (Reuters, Havana, 14/III/2008). These are positive steps but it will be extremely difficult to replace Venezuela if Chávez falls from power or oil prices drop significantly due to a world recession. On the other hand, if Cuba discovers extensive oil deposits of adequate quality and profitability, it will reduce its dependence on Venezuela significantly.\n\nChina is Cuba’s second-largest trading partner, as a result of agreements signed in the period 2004-07. These included a 10-year delay in payment of Cuban debt, €150 million in credit to buy Chinese products (buses, refrigerators and foodstuffs) and set up a joint venture biotechnology company. But a €400 million investment to complete the Camariocas plant was cancelled (Chávez assumed this and added more) and a promise to invest €880 million to work the huge nickel deposit at San Felipe has not materialised, although China retains rights to it, preventing Cuba from seeking another investor. As of 2007 it is supposed to export 400,000 tons of sugar to China but this is impossible because that is all Cuba has for export and it has many obligations; the main export is nickel. There are other problems in Cuba’s trade ties: prices of Chinese goods are higher than in other countries (which would explain the fact that most of the buses have not arrived and Cuba is buying them elsewhere); Cuba has to deal with intermediaries who earn a commission and 60% of Chinese companies are in private hands, which reduces the Chinese government’s ability to help Cuba. And interest rates are the same as those applied by China government to its companies and Cuba is asking for a lower rate (Fornés, 2007).\n\nThe US trade embargo against Cuba has been criticised almost unanimously by the UN for many years, and its toughening under the Bush Administration has been assailed even by many Cuban-Americans who can only travel to Cuba every three years and suffer restrictions in the remittances they can send. The policy has been ineffective, and the Cuban government has used it to justify its economic policy errors and their harmful effects. The embargo creates difficulties but is no longer the fundamental economic problem for Cuba[16] because the island trades with and receives investment from many countries. Furthermore, the embargo was eased in 2001 to allow exports of US foodstuffs, and as of 2007 more than €1.9 billion worth made their way to Cuba. This made the US Cuba’s seventh-largest trading partner and its main food supplier. Cuba’s main economic problem is its inability to increase production so as to satisfy its domestic needs and have enough left over for exporting.\n\nCuba does not have full membership in the main regional trade associations (the Central American Common Market, the North American Free Trade Agreement and MERCOSUR[17]) and it has been excluded from the Free Trade Area of the Americas. But along with Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador it has launched the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). Cuba has joined CARICOM but its trade with Caribbean member states amounted to just 0.8% of its total trade in 2006 (ONE, 2007). The conviction of 75 peaceful dissidents in 2003, just as Cuba was negotiating with the EU’s Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, triggered a crisis that prevented Cuba from joining the Cotonou Agreement and gaining access to its €10 billion aid fund; the EU suspended economic aid to Cuba and imposed political sanctions. In 2005 the EU suspended the last of those sanctions and in 2006 Spain launched a policy of dialogue, rescheduling Cuban debt and increasing trade.[18] Michel returned to Cuba in March 2008 and held talks with senior Cuban leaders (but not with dissidents), who stated that in order to resume dialogue the EU must definitively eliminate the sanctions.[19]\n\n5. Foreign Debt\n\nCuba’s foreign debt in hard currency soared 155% between 1989 and 2007 (from US$6 billion to US$15.8 billion), mainly due to accrual of interest on unpaid capital and the depreciation of the dollar, in addition to new debt undertaken with Venezuela and China. Cuba has failed to pay off debt owed to South Africa, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Spain, France, Japan, Mexico, the UK and othercountries. As of late 2007, Cuba’s total foreign debt was estimated at US$37.905 billion (42% of it in hard currencies and 58% in non-convertible currencies with Russia and other former communist countries[20]). This is equivalent to US$3,410 per capita, three times the Latin American average of US$1,173 (figures calculated by the author on the basis of Cuba’s debt as per estimated by ICCAS, 2008, and population according to ONE, 2008, as well as Latin American debt and population figures from ECLAC, 2007b and 2007c). As a percentage of exports of goods and services in 2004 (the last year for which figures are available), a tool often used by financial institutions to measure a country’s ability to pay, Cuba’s debt in foreign currency alone yielded the figure of 213%, compared with a regional average of 138% (ECLAC, 2006b). Short-term debt fell by 27% in 2006 while medium- and long-term debt rose 73%, because Cuba’s debt with Venezuela is long-term,[21] and earlier short-term debt has been rescheduled, as have medium-term credits (Soberón, 2005; ECLAC, 2006a). Since 2006 Cuba has separated ‘immobilised’ debt, which accounts for 56.5% of the total –it has been rescheduled since 1986 and is owed mainly to the Paris Club of creditors– from ‘active’ debt that can be renegotiated. It accounts for 43.5% of the total (based en ECLAC, 2007a, and ONE, 2007).\n\n5. Foreign Investment\n\nDisbursed foreign investment, accumulated from 1995 to 2002, totalled US$2.5 billion, although this figure was never published again. Figures on direct foreign investment have not been published since 2001, when it fell by 91% (from US$448 million to US$39 million); in 2006 it reportedly jumped to US$950 million thanks to Venezuelan investment (Pérez-López, 2007). The number of joint venture companies with foreign investors declined 41% in the period 2002-06, from 403 to 236 (Table 3), while the number of cooperative production contracts fell by 87% in the period 2003-06, going from 441 to 57 (Pérez Villanueva, 2007b).[22] Direct foreign investment is centred on activities that generate small production lines with the technological sectors, lacks lasting potential for expansion due to a lack of natural resources (except tourism), and has had little direct impact on the use of installed industrial capacity or skilled labour (Pérez Villanueva, 2004). Marta Lomas, Minister of Foreign Investment and International Cooperation, said in 2007: ‘We are not interested in having many [joint venture companies]… only in the ones that will have an impact on the economy’. She argued that the number of joint venture companies has fallen because Cuba no longer needs small firms and is living priority to strategic sectors like energy, mining and tourism (quoted by Israel, 2007). On the other hand, Raúl Castro said on 26 July 2007 that he was prepared to boost foreign investment that was serious and within the parameters of socialism. One factor that affects overseas financial operations is that two Swiss banks (UBS and Credit Suisse) have stopped doing business with Cuba, due to the UBS scandal in 2005 and the high cost of executing legal norms on deposits. Also complicating things is the fact that three Canadian banks shut down US dollar-denominated accounts held by people with dual nationality (the banks are the Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto Dominion Bank), and the closure of the banks ING and Barclays (Sontag Zeitung, Geneva, 12/XI/2006; Reuters, Havana, 6/VII/2007).\n\n6. Monetary Duality and Exchange Rates\n\nA system of ‘monetary duality’ featuring a ‘national’ peso and a ‘convertible’ peso, or CUC in Spanish (actually it is not convertible because its value is not determined on the international market but rather ilaterally by the government) was introduced in 1994 due to the severe depreciation of the peso and the dollar being authorised as legal tender. The result is that part of the economy works with CUCs, part of it in regular pesos and part of it in dollars. In 2004 the dollar stopped being legal tender, although Cuban people are still allowed to possess them. But only CUCs are accepted by State entities, including stores that operate in hard currency (TRD in Spanish). Exchanges of dollars for CUCs is taxed at the rate of 10%, but this does not happen with euros, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling or Swiss francs. Since March 2005, the CUC is worth 24 pesos and costs 25 national pesos to purchase, with the extra peso added as a commission. In April 2005 the value of the CUC against the euro, US dollar and other currencies was increased by 8%, and the rate of the CUC against the national peso was left unchanged (Mesa-Lago, 2007). Another 8% increase was carried out in April 2008, changing the CUC’s value against all those currencies; furthermore, a commercial margin of 3.5% is charged. The exchange rate between the two kinds of Cuban peso remains unchanged (Agreement 15, 2008). There is currently a heated debate under way in Cuba on whether to do away with ‘monetary duality’ (see II-E y III-A-4).\n\n7. Tourism\n\nThe number of tourists visiting the island grew from 270,000 in 1989 to 1.8 million in 2000; the number was unchanged in 2001, fell in 2002 (due to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US), rose to 2.3 million in 2005 and declined to 2.1 million in 2007, which was still eight times the level corresponding to 1989 (Table 4). Gross revenues from tourism include the cost of imported supplies (between 28% and 39%) which must be deduced in order to calculate net revenues; gross revenues fluctuated in the period 1989-2007, but in the last year it was US$2.236 billion (€1.500 billion), 13 times the 1989 level. The goal of receiving 2.5 million tourists was set in 2006, and the goal of taking in US$2.600 billion in revenue was set in 2002. In 2007 Cuba was 14% shy of meeting these objectives. The number of hotel rooms for tourists doubled in the period 1989-2006 (from 21,400 to 48,700) but the occupancy rate fell from 74.3% to 44.8% in 2000-07 and the average daily expenditure per tourist declined 45% in the period 2003-06. The main source countries for tourism are Canada (31%), the UK (10%), Spain (6%, a fall from 28% in 2007), Italy (6%) and Germany (5%) (ONE, 2008).\n\nTable 4. Tourism Figures for Cuba, 1989 and 2000-07\n\n(1) Cuban figures on ‘lodging establishments’; ECLAC (2002, 2003a to 2006a) gives diverse figures in its publications: 60.7% en 2000, 58% en 2001, 53% and 57% in 2002, 55% and 58.5% in 2003, and 55.7% en 2005.\n\n(2) From ECLAC but with diverse figures: ones shows an 18% fall in spending in the period 1997-2002, from US$184 to US$151 (ECLAC 2002, 2003a); another shows higher figures since 2001, but virtual stagnation in 1998-2003, from US$174 to US$175 (ECLAC 2004a, 2005a).\n\n(3) Cuba first gave the figure of 60.7% but later reduced it (ONE, 2007, 2008).\n\nSources: Cuba CCE (1991); ONE (2001 to 2008); ECLAC (2005a to 2007a).\n\nTourism in Cuba was always cheap, but the number of visitors and the occupancy rate are falling and tourists spend less and less. ECLAC (2006b, 2007a) says this is because tourism packages for Cuba are more expensive than in other countries of the Caribbe (Cancún in Mexico and the Dominican Republic offer better service at a lower price); it also blames insufficient hotel services and the appreciation of the CUC;[23] Monreal also blames a drop in investment and low priority given to this sector (García interview, 2007a). Furthermore, between 2005 and 2007 the number of Cuban-Americans visiting the island fell from 100,000 to 30,000 because of restrictions imposed by the Bush Administration. The number of cruise passengers stopping off in Cuba fell from 102,000 to 11,000 because of Fidel Castro’s criticism of cruise lines, plus the fact that Royal Caribbean bought a Spanish cruise line and cancelled stops in Cuba (AP, Havana, 23/I/2008). In 2006, the Canadian Association of Travel Agents complained to the Cuban Tourism Ministry over what it called inadequate services, theft at hotels and airports, rising costs and trip cancellations (Encuentro en la Red, 26/IV/2006). Most of the hotels were built in the 1990s and have undergone little repair or upkeep so they are in very poor condition; Cuba has one of the lowest return rates in the tourism industry, and an outbreak of dengue fever 2007 frightened visitors (Reuters, Havana, 25/I/2007; El Economista, 7/VII/2007). To address the fall in tourism the Cuban government has announced an investment of 185 million pesos to upgrade hotels and airports and a 20% cut in landing fees for airlines.\n\n8. Balance of Payments\n\nCuba has not released a complete balance of payments report since 2001 (ONE, 2005). The most recent figures from ECLAC (2007a) for 2005 omit exports and imports of services. This have been calculated by the author: the enormous deficit in the balance of goods (5.164 billion pesos) was not offset by the surplus in the balance of services, mainly tourism and professional services rendered overseas (4.240 billion), despite a 56% increase over 2004; the total deficit in the trade balance rose to 924 million pesos and the current account deficit was 154 million; the overall balance declined to 346 million pesos, 62% less than in 2004. The author’s partial reconstruction for 2006 (based on ONE, 2007) suggests that, despite another big increase in the surplus in the balance of services (6.456 billion pesos, this was even lower although very close to the deficit in the balance of goods (6.598 billion pesos); the current account deficit rose to 240 million pesos, due to the enormous deficit in goods, the decline in current transfers (mainly remittances from overseas) and an increase in factor service (payment of interest on debt and repatriation of profits); it was impossible to the total balance due to the lack of two components.\n\nVenezuelan aid changed the Cuban balance of payments from a considerable deficit over the course of four decades to a small surplus in 2006 (a small deficit is reported in 2007); the enormous deficit in the balance of goods in 2006 (6.598 billion pesos) was almost offset by professional services sold to Venezuela (4.456 billion pesos) and to a lesser extent by revenue from tourism (2 billion pesos). It is not known how the professional services are measured.[24] Under the original agreement between the two countries, Cuba would pay the salaries of doctors and paramedics to finance imports of Venezuelan oil. But the 2005 agreement changes this arrangement and since then Venezuela has been paying an estimated 23,000 doctors and paramedics. The author’s calculations indicate the average annual salary of these professionals to be €144,000. This is obviously an overestimate if we take into account that a nurse earns much less than a doctor and a Venezuelan one does not make that kind of money. So there is an implicit subsidy in this operation.\n\nTable 5. Estimates of the Cuban Balance of Payments, 2004-06 (in millions of pesos1)\n\n(1) ECLAC gives the figures in dollars, but at the parity exchange rate with the peso.\n\n(2) ECLAC (2007a) left services blank but reported a positive balance of services of 4.2 billion; services were estimated by the author on the basis of said balance and figures from ECLAC (2006a).\n\n(3) ONE (2007) left services blank but reported a surplus of 6.4 billion in the balance of services, and also gave total exports and imports of goods and services. This allowed the author to estimate the figures that had been omitted.\n\nSources: 2004-05 from ECLAC (2006a, 2007a); 2006 figures ONE (2007).\n\nD. Social Indicators\n\nThis section chooses the most important social indicators for evaluating living standards (Table 6). In 1989 Cuba led Latin America and communist countries in the vast majority of these categories, but the economic crisis triggered big drops in virtually all of them. Economic recovery has allowed Cuba to get back to or even surpass the previous levels in several categories, but in others the numbers remain low and in some there are problems with the reliability of the statistics.\n\nTable 6. Social Indicators in Cuba, 1989 and 2000-07\n\n(1) Per 1,000 live births.\n\n(2) Per 100,000 births.\n\n(3) The preliminary figure is 31.1, a drastic fall that must still be confirmed.\n\nSources: CCE (1991), ONE (2001 to 2008); wages from Vidal (2007), pension figures from Mesa-Lago (2008) and housing figures from Mesa-Lago based on population and housing built, as per CCE (1991), ONE (2001 to 2008).\n\n1. Unemployment\n\nThe official rate of unemployment dropped 77%, from 7.9% in 1989 to 1.8% in 2007, the lowest in Latin America, which had an average jobless rate of 8%. But the rate is significantly underestimated because it treats as employed several categories of people who technically are not employed: laid-off workers who are taking courses to learn a new skill, workers who are studying full-time and getting paid, young people enrolled in the so-called ‘study with employment’ programme, and people who work part-time growing vegetables in patios and urban gardens for their own consumption needs. If we remove these people from those considered to be employed, the jobless rate would rise substantially. Furthermore, many unemployed do not sign up at city unemployment offices because they know they will only be offered jobs in the farming sector (Mesa-Lago, 2005b). The newspaper of Cuba’s youth communist league questioned the official unemployment rate: ‘The unemployment figures… are not real. Provinces like Granma say they have achieved full employment, but why do you see so many unemployed people out on the streets?’. One study showed there were 18 times as many jobless people as stated in the official rate, which ‘shot up the unemployment rate’ and ‘if Granma was one of the models for low unemployment, what are things like in other provinces that gave higher numbers?… The Labour Ministry says young people are not interested in the jobs on offer at employment centres, but it is hard to relieve that 90% of the jobless people detected in 2006 wanted to work and could not find something acceptable’ (Ortiz et al., 2007). The Director of Employment at the Ministry said that at the national level ‘there are 210,797 people of working age who have no interest in or motivation for working’. That would be 4.3% of the working population of 4,847,300. ONE estimates that 20% of the working-age population in Havana does not work; 45% of them are trying to find work but do not accept positions with the State because the pay is low and private companies pay more; 17% of graduates from technical schools did not vie for jobs that were on offer (Granma, 9 & 21/III/2008; ONE, 2008).\n\n2. Wages\n\nDespite increases in nominal wages in 2005, real wages (adjusted yearly for inflation) in 2007 were 76% below the 1989 level. Raúl Castro acknowledged in his speech on 26 July that ‘wages are clearly insufficient to satisfy needs’. He has all but abandoned his role of defending the socialist principle that people give what they can and receive what they need. Castro said wages should be adjusted to better reflect inflation. (R. Castro, 2007a). Martínez (2007) feels this problem should be resolved gradually and in a sustained way, not through immediate and spectacular solutions ‘that are only suited to ignorance and deception, or deliberate efforts to sow confusion’. Rodríguez (2007b) says that in 2007 wages grew at a faster pace than workplace productivity, ‘a negative trend that we must reverse for good’, and that there have been no appropriate and concrete responses to workers’ demands.\n\n3. Health\n\nInfant mortality was the only indicator that declined during the crisis. It fell 52% from 11.1 to 5.3 per 1,000 live births in the period 1989-2007, the lowest rate in the western hemisphere after Canada. This was achieved by forcing all pregnant women to undergo a monthly sonogram and other tests to determine if the foetus is healthy; if a malformation is detected an abortion is carried out. This has been one of the causes of Cuba’s having the highest abortion rate in the region (Dorschner, 2007). The rate of maternal mortality rose 69%, from 29 to 49.4 per 100,000 live births in the period 1989-2006, but is reported to have fallen to 31.1 in 2007. Here, too, Cuba has manipulated the statistics: starting in 1996 a new statistical series replaced the category of maternal death through ‘other causes’. Comparing the two series in 1996-2000 shows that the new one reduced the rate by 10.6 points in the annual average. (Mesa-Lago, 2005b); if one corrects this under-estimate, the rate for 2007 goes up to 41.7, which is 43% higher than the rate in 1989. The ratio of inhabitants per doctor declined from 276 to 158 in 1990-2006 (ONE, 2007) and is the lowest in the region, but 37,500 doctors (half the total) work overseas (Rodríguez, 2007b); if you subtract these doctors, the rate goes up to 330 in 2006, 20% higher than in 1989. This exodus has caused a major decrease in access to primary medical care and long waiting lists, especially for surgery. According to the Deputy Minister for Public Health, Joaquín García, in dentistry ‘as of the end of 2007 production of false teeth has not reached the level there was 18 years ago’ (AFP, Havana, 6/XII/2007). There is a severe shortage of medicines, available only in stores that deal in hard currency; 80% of the drinking water grid is in ‘bad or average’ condition and treatment of waste water and sewage has deteriorated severely (Bohemia, Havana, 9/XI/2007; Opciones, La Habana, January 2008). The number of hospital beds fell 19% in the period 1995-2006 (ONE, 2007); Rodríguez (2007b) reports that 45 clinics have been repaired and enlarged but ‘the quality of services is not commensurate with the recourses the country spends on them’.\n\n4. Social Security Pensions\n\nDespite nominal increases in pensions that were enacted in 2005, average real pensions in 2006 were 61% below the level corresponding to 1989. These slim pensions accounted for 6% of GDP and 13% of the state budget in 2007 and both percentages will continue to grow. Rodríguez (2007b) says more than 16% of Cuba’s population is over the age of 60, and for two years in a row the overall population has declined. It is already the second most aged in the region. So measures are needed to raise the birth rate and take care of the elderly. Revenue from money paid by companies is not enough to finance expenditures for pensions. The deficit in this area as a portion of GDP grew from 1.3% to 2.5% in 1986-2006 (Mesa-Lago, 2008).\n\n5. Education\n\nEnrolment at the intermediate level has risen and soared at the higher level. University enrolment shot up 172% in the period 1989-2007, but it was concentrated in humanities and social sciences (3,360%), medicine (1,131%) and teacher training (724%); but it rose only 12% in agriculture and 27% in technical areas, and fell 40% in natural sciences and mathematics (ONE, 2007). The enormous investment in humanities and teacher training, contrasted with a deficit in areas of study that are crucial to Cuba’s development, is an inefficient use of funds and will create problems in the future. More to the point, the Higher Education Minister, Luis Ignacio Gómez, says there is a shortage of teachers because many have quit the profession due to low salaries. This forced the government to create a programme of so-called ‘emerging’ teachers for primary schools (26,000). They are trained in just eight months and then assigned to a ‘tutor’ who is supposed to oversee four of them although in actual practice the number is usually 10, and in many cases the tutor is also an ‘emerging’ teacher (Juventud Rebelde, 5/VIII/2007; Granma, 24/X/2007). Many doctors have also switched to other jobs because their pay was so low, which means hefty investment in their training is lost. Finally, universities churned out so many graduates in social studies (40,000) that this produced a glut, making it hard to find work for them. So enrolments in this area were cut 86% in the 2007/08 academic year (ONE, 2008). Jorge Mattar, Deputy Director of the ECLAC office in Mexico, said ‘Cuba must have the highest rate of underemployment in all of Latin America. It has a highly educated population –technicians, professional-level people– whose skills are wasted [because] they are doing other kinds of work’ (AFP, Mexico, 7/IV/2007).\n\n6. Housing\n\nThis is widely recognised as Cuba’s gravest social problem. The population has doubled in the period 1959-2007, but the number of homes built did not keep pace with those destroyed because of lack of repair and upkeep. The number of units built per 1,000 inhabitants fell from 6 to 1.4 from 1989 to 2003-04, rose to 9.9 in 2006 with the construction of 111,000 units (76% of the goal of 150,000 and to a large extent through completion of houses that were already under construction) but fell to 4.6 in 2007, with 51,790 homes built (74% of the goal of 70,000); in 2007 the rate was 25% below the level corresponding to 1989 (based on CEE, 1991; ONE, 2007, 2008). And construction has not offset the fact that 76,854 homes were destroyed and 91,472 seriously damaged by five hurricanes and tropical storms in recent years. The 2008 budget earmarked only 1% of its money to housing construction, and the goal is 50,000 homes(Barreiro, 2007). In 2005, the National Housing Institute said 43% of Cuban homes were in bad or average condition; officially, Cuba needs 500,000 homes but the real figure is probably twice as much. There is a 10-year waiting list for one million families (Petras & Eastman-Abaya, 2007). The permuta system for moving from one home into another of a similar size, quality and location is extremely bureaucratic, violated systematically and plagued with corruption. The Cuban jurist Narciso Cobo says: ‘It is illusory to assume that just because (buying and selling of homes) is almost prohibitively regulated it is not going to take place. It has continued, and along the way it has affected an unimaginable number of citisens’ (‘Sobre la Transición…’, 2007).\n\n6. Poverty and Inequality\n\nPoverty in Havana increased 271% in the period 1988-2002. In the past year one poll estimated the poverty rate at 20% (ONE, 2001) and described it as ‘the state of possessing insufficient monetary revenue, which limits consumption of food and other essential goods and services (as well as) lack of housing or deterioration of it or its furnishings, and public transport’. In the city of Havana, 23% of the population said they considered themselves poor and another 23% ‘almost poor’, for a total of 46%; as for nutrition, the proportion was similar, but the five deciles of lowest income surpassed the average with a range of 52% to 62%. Monthly expenditure on food in pesos for people in decile 9 (the tenth, the highest income bracket, was not disclosed) was 659 pesos, 12 times higher than the poorest decile (55 pesos). People over age 60, women who lead households on their own, blacks and mestizos predominate in the poorest deciles (whites predominate in decile 9). Those surveyed identified five main problems: 75.5% cited insufficient wages, 70% said lack of transport or difficulty in accessing it, and nearly 70% said they did not have enough food, or decrepit housing, clothes or shoes (Añé, 2007). Poverty is worst in the eastern provinces, from which people have migrated to the Cuban capital.\n\nThere are major disparities between Cuba’s 15 provinces; in 2003 the Human Development Index found that the city of Havana was 30% above Granma in six combined indicators (Méndez et al., 2007). In 2006, the infant mortality rate oscillated between 2.2 and 7.9, while maternal mortality fluctuated between 16.9 and 96.6; and as for remittances and circulation of the US dollar, Havana received/had 44 times as much as Guantánamo (ONE, 2007; Sánchez-Egozcue, 2007). The Gini co-efficient of inequality rose 64% in 1989-99 (from 0.22 to 0.41; recent figures are not available). If it were based only on ‘national pesos’, excluding the CUC and remittances, if these were included the Gini would be much higher (Mesa-Lago, 2005b). The tax system is regressive because 64.5% of revenue in 2006 came from indirect taxes (on sales and services) while only 35.5% was generated by direct taxes (income, utilities) with a progressive effect (based on ONE, 2007).\n\nECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEBATE\n\nFidel Castro warned in a speech at the University of Havana in 2005 that the Cuban revolution could be reversible, not only because of an external threat from the United Staes but also because of domestic problems. But that warning was not followed up with discussion. In his speech on 26 July 2007 Raúl Castro acknowledged that Cuba had serious socio-economic problems and he promised to introduce ‘structural reforms’ although he did not define them and warned that ‘everything cannot be resolved immediately [and] do not expect spectacular solutions’ (R. Castro, 2007a).[25] After a decade of silence, this speech triggered broad and deep debate on the economy and the reforms it needed, raising significantly people’s expectations for change.\n\nRaúl sent an order to Cuba’s 3,000 state-run companies and agencies for them to provide him, in August or September of 2007, with a list of the main problems they faced and proposals for resolving them. In the city of Havana, where most of the companies are based, these firms mainly blamed centralisation, and specifically the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the single account of the Central Bank of Cuba. The following example illustrates the inefficiency and distortion caused by these policies: a company needed to import a vehicle and requested authorisation from the Central Bank for hard currency to buy it. The request was turned down. The company then asked for and received permission and currency to buy spare parts overseas. Through an intermediary, the company bought the vehicle it needed overseas, had it taken apart and the pieces imported, which it put back together in Cuba (information from a Cuban economist who requested anonymity, 2007).\n\nThere is a consensus that reforms should fall within ‘socialist parameters’ but these are not defined and there is a big different between the absolute statism of North Korea and the ‘market socialism’ of China and Vietnam. Monreal says ‘socialism allows variants, different configurations’, although he feels there is still no agreement: ‘at this time a relatively slow process is under way in search of a political consensus that might establish rules for the details of structural change’. Monreal says the role of economists is to provide data and analysis so that public policies rely on solid information, but decisions are made by leaders (García interview, 2007a). But an economist of the new generation requires a more important role: ‘Real dialogue is needed between social scientists and those who make decisions. Does it make sense to create institutions and have people study, and then not rely on them, not even call them to see what they think? Errors have been committed even though there were specialists available … Nothing can justify that’ (Lage Cordoníu, ‘On the Transition…’, 2007).\n\nThe following comments, mainly from economists but also from political scientists, jurists, philosophers, sociologists and students, all of them living in Cuba, show there is a wide range of opinion, although they always rule out a free market system with scant regulation by the state.\n\nA. Official Inertia and a Lack of Participation\n\nThe Chairman of the National Assembly’s Commission on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, José Luis Toledo, has criticised the impunity with which government employees ‘make a mockery of the essential aspiration of our society, and the spirit and letter of the Constitution’. He was referring to the ineffectiveness of the many complaints and requests that Cuban citizens file with government agencies and sloppy management that prevents problems from being resolved. He criticised the indolence and inefficiency of members of the National Assembly and other state agencies, where he said ‘there seems to be overwhelming unanimity and very few debates in which positions are contrasted… whereas debate is essential… for making decisions in such complex circumstances as those which the country is going through… [to ignore this] would be a lamentable display of ignorance or weakness’. Delegates to the Assembly should stop complaining and exercise their duties to change the members of the board of directors, the bosses of agencies and companies that do not fulfil their obligations’ (Ronquillo interview, 2007). The sociologist Aurelio Alonso says participation by Cuban citizens is unsatisfactory. ‘The assembly of accountability of the People’s Power… does not allow true interaction. To the contrary, rather than encouraging discussion of community problems, it encourages a lack of communication’ (‘On the Transition…’, 2007). The journalist Soledad Cruz (2007) said that ‘participation by people is reduced to complying, supporting whatever is decided by those higher up, and that takes away from them a sense of responsibility… [people] need to feel that that they are really participating in decision making… that they are listened to and taken into account’. According to Hernández, people want a socialist society in which citizens participate in a more effective way and the system also works more effectively; in which opinion and participation by the people is not limited just to mobilisation but also extends to decision-making and control over policy; in which the organs of people’s power, workers and collective organisations really have the capability to decide on and resolve problems with food, transport, nutrition, etc’ (García interview, 2007b).\n\nB. The Chinese and Vietnamese Models\n\nMonreal relieves that ‘the Chinese and Vietnamese experiences are very interesting. I am not saying that we should copy them… but there is something to be learned because they had problems similar to those of the Cuban people in agriculture and resolved them quite successfully’. The economy needs a comprehensive transformation to the style of those two Asian countries, a chance that will require much more decentralisation and acceptance of private markets than the government has allowed until now, with the goal of confronting insufficient motivation and innovation, and letting the market determine prices, provide incentives to companies and encourage them to take risks (interviews with Davies, 2007, and García, 2007a). Pérez Villanueva (2008) says ‘Vietnam has managed to introduce the market and its economy has high levels of growth, with rising standards of living, and is now a pace-setter in world exports’.\n\nA comparison by Perkins (2004) of the reforms carried out by the three countries and their effects is most revealing. China and Vietnam abandoned collective agriculture and replaced it with family farms and free agricultural markets; Cuba turned part of its state-run farms into UBPCs which lack autonomy and a dependent on the government, it buys their harvests at a below-market price and restricts their participation in agricultural markets. China first transferred most of its state-owned industry to cities and villages, and then to companies with direct foreign investment, while in Vietnam most exports are carried out by companies with such investment; in 2004 less than 25% of Chinese industry was owned by the state, and the figure was only slightly higher in Vietnam. In Cuba, the industrial sector is state property, a situation which has adverse effects for production, except for sectors with direct foreign investment. Thanks to laws which provided direct foreign investment with secure and reliable legal framework, Vietnam attracted US$2 billion in such investment in 1997; in Cuba it fell 41% in the period 2002-06 due to restrictions imposed by the state and to the revoking of some contracts. In 2002 Cuba could boast only 5% the direct foreign investment that Vietnam did. Rapid growth of imports paid for in hard currency was financed by fast-growing exports (Vietnam went from being a net importer of rice to a net exporter); China ended central, ministerial control of foreign trade and devalued its currency in order to make its exports more competitive, while Vietnam freed up its exchange rat and let its currency float, with similar results. Cuba went in the other direction: in 2003 it reversed the modest decentralisation it had carried out in the foreign trade sector in the 1990s and re-concentrated power in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Central Bank. It also continues to set an exchange rate that is not very realistic, and raised the value of the convertible peso in 2005.\n\nDuring a visit to Cuba in 2003, just as Cuba was rolling back on reforms, Xu Shicheng, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Cuba ‘should establish mechanisms of socialist, market-based economy, and do away with egalitarianism’(quoted by Contreras, 2007). During a trip to China in 1997, Raúl Castro met with Zhu Rongji, the designer of many economic reforms, and with hundreds of managers and businessmen, while in during a trip in 2005 he said: ‘What you have done here really inspires hope… there are people who are worried about the evolution of China, but I am content and at ease [with what I have seen]’ (Granma, 21/IV/2005). Currently in Cuba there is a Study Group examining the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the experiences of China and Vietnam, and the lessons these events offer for socialism.\n\nC. Overall Strategies\n\nAccording to Monreal (2007), ‘In order to recover, (Cuba) needs to overcome completely the effects of the crisis… above all the major contraction of consumption and living standards, both of which remain depressed, the huge undercapitalisation at the material base, and the insufficient functioning of a considerable number of productive branches and units… The current economic reactivation could be the necessary albeit insufficient launching point for putting the country on a path toward economic development [however] socioeconomic transformation requires much more than favourable conditions… such as the current ones’; this reactivation ‘is in no way of an irreversible nature’ because it is based on ‘the action of exogenous factors’ that cannot be controlled. Pérez Villanueva (2004, 2006, 2007a) agrees with this, and adds that the recovery has yet to overcome the major contraction in levels of consumption, individual well-being and transport that existed in 1989. He proposes changing the current productive and technological model with wide-ranging economic and financial reforms; decentralisation of decision-making and a more important role for the market; allowing remittances to be invested in small- and medium-size family-run companies; promoting cooperatives in the service sector, and ones that are complementary to state industries (this would boost competition, efficiency, employment, demand and workers’ wages). He also suggests the state limit itself to devising policies and creating proper instruments for non-state players to operate. As initial measures for absorbing the excess in the money supply have run their course, he recommends seeking new mechanisms that provide a greater range of offers to those who have high income and savings. Hernández says ‘there is a broad consensus on the importance of transforming the Cuban model, on the social system carrying on with a different model… that it be able to correct itself’; Cuba should resume reforms of 1993-96 that were interrupted, such as economic decentralisation[26] (García interview, 2007b).\n\nD. Property\n\nIn a study by a group of economists and philosophers who analysed the issue of property under Cuba’s communist regime, Luis Marcelo Yera said fundamental decisions for businesses are taken by the government. He said many of these decisions should be transferred to workers and that state-run companies should compete with other forms of property (Orta et al., 2006). In a symposium on the communist transition in Cuba that was published in Temas, most participants denied that socialist property is equivalent to state property. The problem with the latter ‘is that which belongs to everyone belongs to no one, and therefore no one takes responsibility for it’; ‘workers do not feel like owners of the means of production, but rather say they belong to the State, which supposedly represents the people. For this reason it is necessary to seek new way in which companies become the real property of the workers’. The sociologist Aurelio Alonso, whose position was quite typical of the entire group, proposed that the State retain functions in terms of regulations and investment, in addition to ownership of natural resources (oil, minerals) and major utilities (electricity, gas and water), but that it also endorse a mixed economy not just with foreign investment but also national investment; that it accept and nurture a private sector withfamily-based enterprise in production and service activities in those cases in which it is more efficient in resolving the problems of society (beyond the private activities that are currently allowed), as well as cooperative property (‘Sobre la Transición…’, 2007). Monreal says ‘a socialist state can accommodate a national private sector that is much broader than that which is being considered now… There are areas in which there should be a major [state-run] company, such as nickel, steel, electricity… but the state does not necessarily have to take care of repairing automobiles or shoes or producing food… an endless list of things that today are done inefficiently by state-run companies, and it has been proved that the private and cooperative sector can do it better’. These activities are based on an individual’s knowledge and experience, and do not require a lot of capital; a specialised, state-run banking network could amass capital and provide loans (interview by García, 2007a). Hernández supports the idea of setting up cooperatives in non-farm areas (textiles, footwear, etc), and the legalisation of small private companies and not only paladares, able to hire people who are not relatives and sell in private markets[27] (Davies interview, 2007).\n\nRafael Campos presented 15 proposals to the Party Central Committee and Cuba’s three national newspapers (which did not publish them) and in them he criticised the ‘relative stagnation’ of the Revolution since ‘the processes of socialising property were paralysed’ by making socialisation equivalent to state take-over: excessive centralisation in decision-making, planning and the accumulation and distribution of surpluses, which hinder society’s advance, the economy and living standards. But he said none of his proposals suggested ‘capitalist privatisation of companies, much less surrender to foreign capital’. He said his proposals call for ‘cooperativism, self-management and co-management.’, which are socialist forms of collective ownership; while handing over land to peasants and self-employment are non-capitalist individual property, and the participation of indirect foreign capital in urban transport does not imply its privatisation (interview by Ravsberg, 2007).\n\nE. Monetary Policy\n\nSince the economy was de-dollarised in 2003, a debate has emerged in Cuba on the negative effects of ‘monetary duality’ (having a national peso and a convertible one, the CUC). ECLAC supports eliminating this duality, arguing that it creates many distortions in fiscal accounting and monetary policy, and hinders the creation of a real financial market (Jorge Mattar, AFP, Mexico, 7/II/2007). Another damaging effect is the segmentation created by having part of the economy operate with CUCs (for instance, monetary and financial accounting, prices in TRD hard currency stores) and another with the ‘national peso’ (for example, wages, acopio payments, and prices of rationed goods). Yet another negative effect is that the current, unrealistic exchange rate makes it hard to know accurately how competitive Cuban exports are, as well as the real value of imports. The issue of monetary unification has taken on even more importance in the current debate because there have been few internal analyses of whether this is viable. Marquetti (2006) believes ‘monetary duality will continue to play a relatively important role, [so] it cannot be eliminated, at least over the short term’; monetary unification would require: (1) solid recovery of the economy; (2) sustaining a situation of macroeconomic stability and fiscal health; (3) a significant increase in financial reserves; (4) a major reduction in the current account deficit; (5) financial ability to meet external commitments; (6) a sustained increase in gross capital formation and access to external savings in favourable conditions; and (7) attaining international recognition of the Cuban currency. There has been improvement in some of these areas, but most of these goals have not been achieved. Monreal notes that the productivity of the State economy based on the peso is very low and that monetary unification with an increase in production and productivity would put pressure on prices, wages and pensions. So it would first be necessary to carry out a structural reform of the economy. He adds that the Chinese resolved the duality issue by increasing production and productivity. This allowed them to revalue the national currency and eventually have a single currency recognised on the world market. (García interview, 2007a). Pérez Villanueva (2008) recommends first getting rid of exchange controls on companies, without touching the controls on rates for the population. Marquetti says the exchange rate for the CUC is over-valued and wonders (without providing an answer) about the impact on exports of goods and on tourism, while Monreal feels the appreciation of the CUC against the dollar was a ‘political rather than economic’ measure.\n\nF. Agriculture\n\nArmando Nova (2006, 2007), who is rumoured to have been asked by Raúl Castro for a report on the Cuban agricultural sector, says the agricultural reforms of the early 90s went only half-way. The fundamental problem with agriculture is the high concentration of land ownership in state hands and low wages, which alienate workers. For this reason he recommends economic, structural and organisational transformations in order to achieve the necessary reactivation and efficiency. The goal is for workers to act and participate as if they were owners, and have incentives to increase production: granting autonomy to the UBPCs and reducing their size,[28] paying adequate wages to their members, encouraging the UBPCs and other cooperatives to participate in free agricultural markets; breaking the state monopoly and eliminating current restrictions in order to boost competition, increase supply and reduce prices; and authorising foreign investment in agriculture (it only exists for Israel in the citrus sector). The State should regulate the framework for supply and demand, assign a million hectares of idle land to families and individuals and arrange for producers, either individually or in a cooperative fashion, sell directly to agricultural markets, while the market should provide production incentives and aid in marketing. It is also essential to boost sugar cane production, which is key for feeding people and animals, besides generating energy, and convert it into a biotech industry and ethanol-producer. Monreal contrasts the current system’s inability to produce food with the existence of available land and labourers to do the job. The existing structure and forms of ownership do not create incentives for resolving the problem. So a substantial part of state-owned land should be transferred to private producers, family-run businesses and cooperatives. It is also necessary to provide producers with supplies, create specialised financial institutions and introduce less-centralised mechanisms for land management. Cuba needs to be more daring than it was with the reforms of the 1990s, because changes will not be effective if a substantial part of agricultural production is left to the current system in which the State is the only buyer and sets prices. Under a new reform scenario the State ‘would basically play a regulatory role, eliminating mandatory administrative measures for sales and price-setting, which should be left to the market. Taxes on farm production should not be onerous because the idea is to stimulate production and lower prices’ (Garcia interview, 2007a). Espinosa (2007c) proposes that farmland be handed over to independent persons and cooperatives through sale, usufruct or lease with an option to buy, depending on what condition the land is in. Owners could buy the supplies they need and grow crops freely, sell their produce and set prices, using intermediaries. These measures would eliminate current subsidies for UBPCs, whose resources could be transferred to small loans for individual and collective farmers.\n\nG. External Sector\n\nFor Monreal (2007) the structural deficiency of an export-based economy should be overcome by importing products that diversify the country’s productive base, including production of capital goods, and exporting in a more profitable way, replacing raw materials with goods based on technology and knowledge. Marquetti supports the idea of promoting exports to reduce the trade deficit through measures to make them more competitive in the world market. He suggests reducing interest on loans for new exports, providing incentives to export entities capable of articulating domestic and international strategies, establishing quality standards for export products and sanctioning violations of these standards (in Pérez Villanueva, 2004). There is a consensus on the need to increase foreign investment. Pérez Villanueva (2006) argues that, in order to attract it in large numbers, healthy macroeconomic policies are not enough; what is needed are deep reforms in economic and financial relations. He recommends expanding such investment and stimulating it in other, more dynamic sectors in world trade (including sugar, transport and services), perfecting current rules with cohesive policies and greater integration.\n\nH. Labour and Social Policy\n\nThe budget for 2007 dedicated 45% of its spending to education, health, social security and social assistance (ONE, 2008). Togores & García (2006) believe ‘the economic crisis and the process of adjustment have shown that the preservation of social benefits should move on to a new phase in which their financial sustainability is associated with development of the economy and [necessary] structural and organisational changes… decisions on social policy should be made taking into account not only social purposes but rather they should respect principles of economic equilibrium’. For instance, social security and assistance seriously damage the fiscal deficit and this burden, which today is carried only by the State, should be shared by other contributors (workers) and the retirement age should be increased. In order to finance social services, Campos suggests that increased production will bring in more revenue through taxes, and these will be administered more efficiently through local handling of part of them and more autonomous management of budgets. He also proposes doing away with rationing cards, granting direct subsidies focusing on people with the lowest incomes, and raising salaries to compensate for the rise in prices that would occur (Ravsberg interview, 2007). Alexis Codina adds that the abundant resources assigned to price subsidies through the rationing cards, which are received by everyone regardless of their income level, should be reserved only for the poorest people and the rest should have to resort to the market (‘Sobre la Transición…’, 2007).\n\nPérez Villanueva said it is essential to establish a direct link between work and the profits of state-run companies. ‘It is unbelievable that someone does a good job for a salary of 200 pesos but also has to buy… all the supplies they need in order to work’ (quoted by Orta et al., 2006). Cuba’s low unemployment rate has been achieved through over-employment in social sectors and by not raising it in productive sectors, so emphasis should be placed on the latter. To ease the significant regional disparity, he proposes programmes that improve levels in provinces that are economically and socially underprivileged (Pérez Villanueva, 2007). In order to reduce poverty, Añé (2007) recommends eliminating monetary duality, reducing the segmentation of the market, raising the lowest salaries and consolidating and evaluating the effectiveness of new social programs. A group of Roman Catholic economists (GE, 2006) advocates a fair minimum wage in each sector of the economy in line with basic needs, the state of the economy and business profits; freedom to be self-employed; incentives for companies to create productive work and mandatory unemployment insurance; adequate pensions, social assistance for vulnerable groups, and adequate financing and efficient use of health-care resources. Triana (2007) proposes investing more in technical branches of study in the educational system and those which contribute knowledge, even though these are more expensive than humanities, teaching and social sciences. Hernández argues that the law originally stipulated that housing belongs to citizens and it is reasonable for them to be able to do with it as they wish, such as sell and also buy. It is also necessary for people to be able to repair their homes and build them with their own means (García interview, 2007b). Espinosa (2007c) recommends privatising all homes (assigning those which are not currently owned to their tenants or those who occupy them through usufruct), allowing them to use the homes as collateral for loans to repair them or invest in small- and medium-sized companies.\n\nI. The Aspirations of Young People\n\nIn late 2006 Juventud Rebelde published the results of interviews with 280 young Cubans who were asked to give their vision of Cuba in 2020. They said the economy was their main worry: ‘Today we still have many mistakes… there are many things to correct… for this reason we need efficient leaders. [More criticism is necessary] otherwise we will continue to be in a bad state; although today they talk about engaging in it (criticism), in reality it is not done… double standards must disappear completely [because there are leaders who] tend to ask for honesty, savings and sacrifice, when they themselves never do it’. Those interviewed envisioned a country in which wages were commensurate with prices and sufficient to meet basic needs, with just one currency, better transportation, paved streets and adequate water supplies, without blackouts or prostitution (Pérez e"
