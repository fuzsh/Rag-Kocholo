        "text": "Mzava Sports CEO\n\nEnrolling in the FIFA Exam Preparation Course with SMWW was one of the best decisions I've made for my career in sports management. The course guided me through comprehensive insights into FIFA regulations, governance structures, and disciplinary processes. Under the guidance of experienced instructors and fellow students, I gained a deep understanding of the complexities of FIFA's operations and the principles of ethical conduct in sports governance. The interactive learning environment, (weekly assignments, two minutes drill questions, video chats) helped me gain knowledge and skills to prepare effectively for the FIFA exam. I highly recommend the FIFA Exam Preparation Course with SMWW to anyone seeking to advance their career in sports management and enhance their understanding of FIFA regulations and governance\n\nFIFA Agent FAQ\n\nSenior Advisor\n\nIn my opinion and my experience, the most benefit of having this course is as follows: 1- The online course is convenient for most people. 2- Having candidates from different cultures and backgrounds. 3- The video chat is so exciting for having different points of view from different cultures. 4- the flow of information I gained from both experienced professionals Dr. Mushtaque and Dr. Lashbrook. I appreciate the time and effort they gave to us.\n\nSports Administration\n\nNFLPA Agent\n\nI would like to thank SMWW for offering the NFLPA Exam Prep course which prepared me to successfully pass the exam. I am so thankful that I was able to find SMWW and for putting me in a position to accomplish a goal I have worked very hard to attain! Joel prepares students to tackle the exam with the questions he provides as well as providing the reasoning for the answers. Now, it is on the student to retain the material and be able to recognize it when seeing it on the test but he and the course give you the best chance for success. All the student has to do is put in the work. I am beyond excited to state that by the end of the month I will be a certified/licensed NFLPA Contract Advisor! Thank you!\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nThe things that I learned from this course are that networking is a lot bigger deal than I realized. I learned how to write scouting reports and get really good feedback on them as to what I need to work on and it's nice knowing that I can make mistakes and learn from them here instead of making them later. I also know that thanks to this course I will be further along than a lot of the people in my position.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nPresident New King Multimedia Group LLC\n\nMy purpose and goal for taking this course were to enhance my basketball knowledge beyond pure skill and on-court training. Internally I knew that I wanted to be involved with the game I felt/feel so passionate about, but I had no idea how to begin. In no way did I realize by taking this course would enable me to talk to people I have admired for so many years. For many years I have wondered what and how executives made their decisions on a player. Talking to current and former NBA scouts learning the intangibles with a player on how to make yourself target for the next level. This course has been nothing short of excellent.\n\nBasketball General Manager and Scouting\n\nStudent-CSU San Marcos\n\nI loved the informational interviews as it was a great way to put myself out there and take my first steps into the professional side of baseball. I particularly loved it because it made us (students) go above and beyond and pushed ourselves to keep trying until we were successful. It taught me that you need to be persistent and never give up if you want to work in any sport. I had interviews that went very successful as I learned a lot from them and am forever grateful for SMWW for this opportunity.\n\nBaseball Analytics\n\nTexas Rangers Catcher\n\nI won't lie I was skeptical coming into the course, but I was truly blown away by the amount of information I learned in 8 WEEKS! The Player Development course run by Dan himself has taught me a lot, even with the knowledge I have been a player in professional baseball. You will learn the ins and outs of what goes on in player development and some key tools to take with you into your coaching or front-office career! I feel 100x more confident about how to create a well ran organization.\n\nBaseball Player Development & Strategy\n\nFrench Professional Hockey Player\n\nI am very satisfied with the SMWW Experience. SMWW provides unique ways to expand your knowledge in the Business you are interested to work in and gives you the opportunity to become an expert with specific knowledge you can only have by following an SMWW Course. Mentors like Harry Sinden, Mike Oke, Dino Caputo, and Claire Cornish are very relevant if you want to understand the Sector and ask questions. The organization and the tools provided (books, expert insights, videos) are very useful to study. SMWW is the best Online Studying Platform I experimented with!\n\nHockey General Manager and Scouting\n\nMartin Luther College (D-III) Sports Information Director\n\nThe SMWW/NetScouts apprenticeship program provided a big opportunity for me to grow as a scout and as an individual looking to break into the basketball industry. The program gives you the hands on experience to live scout D-I basketball games and enhance your skills as a writer. There, you had your articles published to the NetScouts site where you wouldn’t normally be able to do on your own. The part of the apprenticeship that may get overlooked is the weekly chats and the chance to interact with college or international basketball coaches/scouts. That proved to be very valuable and gave insight into the industry that I aspired to join. Having taken the apprenticeship twice, I learned a great deal on analyzing and evaluating players and teams. Carl genuinely wants to see you succeed and he gave me support and mentorship throughout the program.\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nJareed Askew\n\nThe video editing course with Synergy allowed me to gain access to a very important technology that is used throughout the basketball world. I learned how to put together Player personnel, and opponent scouting edits. I also learned what a string is and how NBA teams use it. I believe this course will be very helpful for my career as I now know how to use one of the most used technologies in the industry which a lot of people can not get access to unless they work/worked for a professional team or college team.\n\nBasketball Video Performance Analysis With Synergy\n\nWanda Tatum\n\nSports Worldwide Management is a great educational opportunity for individuals that are interested in learning how to break off into the sports industry. I highly recommend that anyone who is interested in working in the sports industry SMWW is certainly the place for you to get the entry level skills that can open the doors with your own ambitions and the wonderful curriculum that Dr.Lashbrook (Founder of SMWW) has put together for you to obtain your dream career in the industry of Sports in many fields offered . I absolutely would recommend to contact SMWW and your on your way to achieve your goals\n\nAthlete Marketing and Branding\n\nThe biggest thing I learned from the GM & Scouting class is how important building connections & relationships and putting yourself out there is to not only getting your foot in the door but lasting in this industry really is. For the most part, all of us have the tools to scout. We can sharpen those tools and learn different things, but without the relationships and understanding the makeup of players and colleagues it is a tough hill to climb to be successful. This course has provided me the ability to get my name out there and I have been able to connect with scouts and front office personnel throughout the baseball industry, and it has even led to opportunities in my area\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nPro Level Sports Agency Senior Vice President\n\nIn a nutshell, taking courses here at SMWW have giving me the opportunity to network with current and future Sports Agents and Sports Business men and women who are already making an impact in the industry. Due to my connection with SMWW, I've connected with a former classmate, who owns an agency, where I started as an Agent Advisor and have been promoted to Senior Vice President of Business Operations. I feel attending SMWW will place women of sports in a greater position to succeed and flourish in a male dominated industry. Thank you so much, SMWW for being the wind beneath my wings. And for showing me, the sky is no longer the limit. Go beyond those limits and soar!\n\nAthlete Marketing and Branding\n\nSMWW is a great resource for anyone wondering if they have what it takes to break into the wide world of professional sports. The two courses I took (Baseball GM & Scouting, Baseball Analytics) helped me realize what I love about the game, how I want to be involved in the industry, and where I can look to achieve those goals. They do all this with a very human flair - one that encourages you to step out of your comfort zone while welcoming you as part of the SMWW family\n\nBaseball General Manager and ScoutingBaseball GM Course Testimonials\n\nNFLPA Certified Agent\n\nAnyone sitting for the NFLPA exam should enroll in this course. I could not have passed the exam without the course. After sitting through each session and going over the problems, my study partners and I dissected each problem and reworked them to fully understand each concept. Everything finally clicked after re-listening to the recorded sessions and reworking the problems. Joel was most helpful and open to explaining everything to ensure full understanding. The class is was worth every penny spent on it.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nSoDo Mojo Writer\n\nI took the Baseball GM and Scouting course at 17 years old with Dan Evans and Hank Jones and it was an incredible experience. I learned so much from them and I have been able to use what I learned to help me get going in my young career. I hope to take more SMWW classes and attend more events.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nDirector of Rugby at Edinburgh Academicals\n\nThis course took my knowledge and understanding to the next level. The course content will get you thinking outside the box and looking at how you can put your learning into your current setting. It is a must if you are looking to excel in your career in the business end of Rugby, but I would advise anyone involved in Rugby Admin or within Rugby Operations to take this course as it will better you and the club you are involved in.\n\nMick and John are great throughout the 8 weeks with their weekly chats and as mentors to get advice from throughout.\n\nRugby Business Management\n\nSenior Writer, TheHoosier.com (a Rivals.com website)\n\nLearning under Carl Berman of NetScouts Basketball was an extremely valuable experience. Not only as a basketball evaluator but also with growing my writing capabilities. He helped me learn the ins and outs of the basketball industry and all of the details to look for when covering a team or a player. I would highly recommend getting involved with NetScouts and SMWW in any way you can. The connections and experience you gain will be invaluable.\n\nBasketball Video Performance Analysis With SynergyBasketball AnalyticsBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nLA Rams Analytics Intern\n\nI would just like to thank you for the last 8 weeks through the course. It is the first time I have enjoyed studying in my life. You made it extremely interesting and made the learning process as smooth as possible. Your teaching has also given me even more motivation to make a career out of it, hopefully in the NFL!\n\nFootball AnalyticsData Science Analytics\n\nCertified International Cricket Agent\n\nThe Cricket Business Course was diverse and comprehensive. It confirmed for me that this was a passion that I needed to pursue. I really appreciate that Ken has followed up on my career and offered advice. It is impossible to work in a vacuum and I think the way SMWW organizes online Zoom events is a great way to get students connected and motivated.\n\nThank you again to Ken for passing on my details. It is an honor to be considered and that he has made the connection. Ken is a very well respected and active stakeholder of cricket in Australia.\n\nCricket Business Management\n\nI highly recommend SMWW's Athlete Branding and Marketing course taught by Kristen Kuliga. This course afforded me the opportunity to learn from the best. In the course, we tackled effective strategies for building sustainable athlete brands, networks, athlete-agent relationships, social media marketing, understanding endorsement deals, the new NIL bill and its impact on athletes, post-career entrepreneur ventures, and more. The best part of the course was NFL legend Doug Flutie stopping in to speak with the class, as he embodies that which we studied, a great athlete brand with a great story.\n\nAthlete Marketing and Branding\n\nOJHL Cobourg Courgars GM\n\nThe Hockey GM and Scouting course is a fantastic stepping stone for anyone that has ever wanted to get involved in hockey operations. From diving into the role of General Manager and building a roster, to what to look for when scouting players and building a draft list, this course will provide you with the opportunity to pursue hockey as a career. The weekly sessions with Harry Sinden, Dino Caputo, and Mike Oke gave us the opportunity to network with our peers and discuss the hot topics of hockey. I will be using the information, insight, and resources for years to come.\n\nHockey General Manager and Scouting\n\nThe course was honestly an amazing experience. The lecturers are arguably the best you would see around. They answered all the questions with examples. I learned how to connect and the importance of networking. In this business, let honesty be your hallmark. In this course, you will learn more than enough to be amongst the best.\n\nSoccer Agent\n\nGraduate Assistant Men’s Basketball Coach, The Citadel\n\nThe NetScouts Basketball/SMWW apprenticeship program is a great opportunity for anyone with an interest in pursuing a career in basketball. Being a credentialed member on press row was a dream come true for me. You are given the tools to hone your skills of talent evaluation and get feedback on your reports about how to improve. Mr. Berman is hands on with his feedback and has a great deal of respect and experience in this business. While in the program, I attended several SOCON basketball games in my area and two years later I am now coaching in the same conference. Take advantage of this position by forming genuine relationships with as many people as you can\n\nBasketball General Manager and ScoutingBasketball Video Performance Analysis With SynergyAlumni AssociationBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nPerth Wildcats and Perth Lynx\n\nIf you need hands on experience scouting, including feedback and formatting reports, then NetScouts has an ideal option, with their in-depth scouting program. Having spent a full NCAA season scouting for them across the US, I had support the whole way. Entry into games, great seats and excellent advice. Now, with NetScouts teaming up with SMWW, they've gone to a new level. I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to start out in the basketball industry.\n\nBasketball Video Performance Analysis With SynergySalary Cap Analysis & Contract NegotiationData Science AnalyticsBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nBeing an intermediary is something I have had interest in for a very long time, but I was reluctant to take the course, pay money, having it online and all. But after this course, I can say I am very pleased, I thought I knew a lot about dealing with players and the soccer agent job in a whole but SMWW has really been an eye opener. I loved everything about this course, the mentors were exceptional and my course mates were all good guys. If you want to get this course done, dont wait any longer, get on board now because what you take in will guide you in your quest to be an Agent forever.\n\nSoccer Agent\n\nI just want to say thank you for being such a great mentor to me and helping me achieve my goals. You really gave me some clarity and a path to follow and it has helped a ton! Taking that course was really the best investment in my life. I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge and direction.\n\nCoaching At The Next Level\n\nDan Duquette's Player Development course is a brilliant addition to the SMWW baseball operations family of courses. Dan's 4 decades in baseball, primarily as a GM, provide students insight into player development that is unparalleled. The two time Sporting News Executive of the Year's course is the perfect complement to the SMWW Baseball GM and Scouting Course with former Dodgers GM Dan Evans/former Dodgers Scout Hank Jones, and the Baseball Analytics Course with baseball savant Ari Kaplan. These courses together are a triple threat for anyone to have under their belt if they aspire to work in baseball!\n\nBaseball Player Development & Strategy\n\nHall of Fame Quarterback, San Francisco 49ers\n\nMarc is a great football coach, he really is. Off the field, we have become friends over the years and I think very highly of him. On the field, he is very cerebral and thoughtful tactician. He is very smart, very patient, and very competitive. He is also very aggressive, yet he is never afraid to make tough calls.\n\nFootball Player Development & Strategy\n\nHall of Fame Coach, Minnesota Vikings\n\nAs a coach, Marc Trestman absorbs things very quickly and is able to put it into a proper perspective. He knows how to manage people and he really understands the game of football. He has brought it down to a simple denominator, He has realized that football is not as complicated as people like to think it is.\n\nFootball Player Development & Strategy\n\nThe Baseball GM/Scouting course was by far my favorite class that I have completed with SMWW. Hank Jones and Dan Evans provides tremendous information from their experiences and what really goes on within Baseball Operations Departments, takes you behind the scenes in scouting and teaches how to identify the top prospects with multiple tools. I feel very confident in the information that I have learned with this course and I am ready to use it first hand with an organization.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nCalgary Video Scout\n\nAlyssa, Since the NHL Draft Conference, it's been a game-changer to me. The amount of confidence I was able to obtain and how people think at your conference is on another level. I can't thank you, Dr. Lashbrook, and the rest of the SMWW team enough for changing my mentality and the opportunities I’ve been given in hockey. Thanks to the conference, I will be working with a hockey academy in Calgary Alberta Canada this upcoming season. Thank you!\n\nHockey Career Conference at the NHL Draft\n\nSMWW Alumni\n\nThis course was not only thought-provoking and informative to the changes in the way the game is assessed, viewed, and played, but also engaging and fun! I am lucky and blessed to have taken it and have had the chance to connect with Ari, Dan and Hank in the process. I strongly recommend anyone interested in the game to consider taking this course! For those of you sports fanatics with a growth mindset out there, SMWW checks all the boxes.\n\nBaseball General Manager and ScoutingBaseball Analytics\n\nThe College of Idaho\n\nClarity. That is the word I would like to describe what I got from the conference. I knew what the path looks like - whether good or bad. There is no more wondering - I know what it takes and what is expected of me. And of course, I made many new friends and connections that I can’t wait to follow up on.\n\nFootball Career Conference during the NFL Combine\n\nMLB Player Agent\n\nDan is the real deal, he’s worked in affiliated and independent baseball, has dealt with international signings and is well versed in all aspects of the business side of a baseball operation. He has run three MLB clubs and has dealt with all types of players from superstars to utility types, has been in charge of both scouting and player development areas and knows how to engage with ownership groups at the highest level. Having talked about all of the above, Dan’s best attributes are his understanding of a BB organization and knowing how to communicate with all levels of a sports organization. In addition, Toronto’s recent interest in his becoming their next President of BB Ops shows how esteemed Dan is, even by his competitors. I’d recommend signing up for his course, a student will learn about theory but Dan will prepare you for what really happens in the sports world!\n\nWelcome, Dan, to the SMWW family!\n\nBaseball Player Development & Strategy\n\nToronto Blue Jays Interpreter\n\nI am extremely happy to announce that I have accepted Shun Yamaguchi's Interpreter position with the Toronto Blue Jays and now heading to Tampa for Spring Training! If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't have made it to where I am for what I dreamed of.\n\nThank you for all the support you have given me and I hope I can be a good sample for those who are trying to pursue the same type of path as I do.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nFranklin, Michigan\n\nThank you SMWW. I passed the exam and I felt extremely well about the material before and after the exam. During the test breaks, other testers were asking me questions.\n\nAll of that to say, Joel Corry was an outstanding instructor. I appreciate SMWW for such a great course. I also want to thank you, Alyssa, for the support you provided as well.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nMenlo College, Men's Basketball Assistant Coach\n\nInterning for NetScouts Basketball was a tremendous opportunity to get started in the basketball industry. I was able to learn from some of the best in the business and gain some real-world, practical experience in the field. Through this internship, I was provided with the opportunities to get out into the scouting world and add a respected organization to my resume. I would encourage those who have the opportunity to take full advantage and build as many meaningful relationships as possible through this program. It was a great way to break into the industry!\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nHidden Gems Basketball Basketball Coach\n\nWorking as a scout trainee with NetScouts Basketball was the best decision that I have made thus far for my career. While at NetScouts I have gained very valuable experience of being a basketball scout. I have been able to take advantage of some unique opportunities such as working side-by-side with other scouts and journalists on media row while attending high-end Division 1 basketball games. I’ve also been able to sharpen my skills by working on international scouting projects such as the Nordic and European championship games.\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nDirector of Scouting, DMV Warriors (ABA)\n\nNetScouts Basketball’s scout training program has been an amazing part of my professional scouting journey. Through this program, I have learned the ins and outs of scouting and have been given the opportunity to do it in a professional setting. Being affiliated with NetScouts has given me credibility for my career and allowed me to show other organizations my professional worth. I recommend this to anyone interested in scouting, analytics, media relations or just basketball in general.\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nBabcock Hoops, Director of Scouting\n\nNetScouts Basketball has been an integral part of my journey and stands out as one of the best opportunities in the world. The ability to watch high-level basketball at press row has helped me grow as a talent evaluator, as well as a connector. This training program has helped me develop my eye both on the court and through video scouting, while simultaneously introducing me to wonderful people around the NCAA & NBA communities. I highly recommend NetScouts to anyone aspiring to work in the realm of basketball.\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nWestern New England University Graduate Assistant\n\nNetScouts Basketball offers the only opportunity for aspiring scouts to gain meaningful experience scouting live Division 1 games at press row. The program enabled me to be credentialed for high-level college games and hone my scouting ability in a professional setting. Through this unique process, you will drastically improve your ability to evaluate players and assemble professional scouting reports. The scouting experience I’ve gained with NetScouts has contributed directly to my professional development and has resulted in new career opportunities. I highly recommend the program to anyone interested in scouting or working in basketball at any level.\n\nBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nFull 8 Sports Marketing Owner\n\nI started my own business in the Motorsports world hoping I could figure it out as I went. I did that for a while but needed another boost. As introverted as I am, I needed a push for networking in particular. SMWW gave me that push! With the focus of the class on networking within the industry, it made it easier to bring it into the real world. The class brought different aspects and a better understanding of the motorsports industry as a whole. I received some validation that what I was doing in my current business was the way that it was done which gave me more confidence in going out on my own. I would highly recommend this class for anyone who has a passion for motorsports. It doesn't matter if you know what you want to do within the industry, or if you are just exploring options!\n\nMotorsports Management\n\nI took the Hockey GM and Scouting Course iand it taught me the ins and outs of hockey as well as what to look for in a player. I started scouting in the North American 3 Hockey League for 5 years, the NAHL for 3 years and just hired on with the Madison Capitols in the United States Hockey League. Through the learnings of the course and connections I’ve made along the way, I wouldn’t be where I am today without SMWW. Also, I attended the NHL Draft which was a great networking event and I had the opportunity to share my progress and goals with Dr. Lashbrook.\n\nHockey General Manager and ScoutingHockey Career Conference at the NHL DraftHockey Agent\n\nPGA Tough Tournament Operations Specialist\n\nI always had the passion for baseball and was looking for a place to start. I had some doubts at the beginning but as I went through the 8 weeks, talking to actual MLB executives in the industry at a conference and attending the Winter Meetings, I was compelled. Dan not only taught me baseball operations but also guided me to the right people. Through Dan and this program, I connected with a bunch of MLB team executives which eventually lead me to interviews. From the connections that I made throughout, I ended up getting a job at PGA TOUR as a Tournament Operations Specialist.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nG3 ProCamps Group Operations Coordinator\n\nThis course allowed me to reconnect with the spot I love in a different way than before. I work with professional athletes on a regular basis but this will help me to analyze what they do on the field more. I look forward to being able to use what I have learned during this course in the line of work I am in now. I also look forward to seeing what new opportunities having this course under my belt will bring me in the future.\n\nFootball Analytics\n\nHead of Analysis and Assistant Director of Player Personnel\n\nSports Capology was a great experience. The chats were excellence and they taught me so much. The instructor treats you like a friend instead of a student which helps in your learning. He takes the time to explain things as well as listens to what you have to say. If your interested in the salary cap of any sport, this is the course that can teach you all about it.\n\nSalary Cap Analysis & Contract Negotiation\n\nI really enjoyed the conference. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. It was worth the 9-plus hour drive for my family and I. The information that was provided was very beneficial to everyone. Learn from people who have years of experience is great. It’s a great opportunity for people who want to work in sports.\n\nFootball Career Conference during the NFL Combine\n\nI'm writing to you and the rest of your team to thank you! I took the Baseball GM & Scouting Course two years ago and I learned so many skills that have helped me in my career. In December 2018, on my second season has Toros de Herrera G.M. in the Panamanian professional Baseball League my team won the Championship. In January, we got the opportunity to play at the Latin American Baseball Series in Mexico where we finished third and during this series we got a call from the Commissioner of the Caribbean asking if Panama could host a Caribbean Series and get Toros to play in the tournament. Not only did we help them organize the series and were great hosts, but a team that I put together in four days with 15 Toros Players, and 6 Panamanians from other teams and seven players from the Nicaragua and Colombian league won the Series in what is one of the most incredible histories in modern Baseball. We competed against the best teams in the winter leagues and finished with a 4W - 1L record with historic victories against Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.\n\nThanks for your help and hope the programs keep going strong.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nSMWW / NetScouts Apprentice\n\nFor those interested in getting experience in scouting, I fully endorse the SMWW/ Netscouts apprenticeship. One thing that holds people back from their dreams of working in professional basketball is actually getting the real work experience. Other SMWW classes allow aspiring basketball professionals to learn specific skills this program allows you to actually apply them. The media access that this apprenticeship provides is the real cherry on top, it gave me just what I needed, more access to the Raptor 905.\n\nBasketball General Manager and Scouting\n\nRodgers State University Intro to Esports Instructor\n\nI was just able to finish the esports business class this weekend. It is fantastic that SMWW has become one of the first groups in the United States to offer an academic course on esports. I’m very thankful for the opportunity to be included in the first class session. The mentors have great industry knowledge and were good hosts for the video sessions. The Esports Business course is a great overview of esport team management and the fast-growing field of esports opportunities. Direct video conversations with the mentors are worth the time and effort.\n\nEsports Business\n\nI'm very proud to announce that I have formally accepted a Video Scout position with Baseball Info Solutions that I will be starting in March. Not going to lie, it's been a long year filled with a lot of doubt of whether I could even get a job baseball after a lot of rejection but I finally turned a dream that I had in high school into reality. Thank you to everyone who believed that I could make this happen even when I had my doubts. Also, a huge thank you to my mentors at Sports Management Worldwide Dan Evans and Ari Kaplan. I gained so much information from them and their guidance put me in position to make this happen. I'm excited to see where this takes me and I can't wait to get started!\n\nBaseball General Manager and ScoutingBaseball Analytics\n\nManager\n\nSMWW has exposed and opened up my knowledge of the sport Industry. I have been doing sport business casually, lacking the knowledge of what I am required to do and how to act during negotiations, approaching clubs and players. I encourage people who want a successful career to study with SMWW. I thought I knew it all but I was shocked to discover how little I know during the 8 weeks course. Thanks SMWW\n\nSoccer AgentSoccer Analytics\n\nContent Manager, Social Media Manager, & Scout\n\nI took the Football GM and Scouting course over the summer and I loved everything about it. It taught me some insights of the league that I didn't know about. Our mentors, Russ Lande, Mark Dominik, and John Wooten were amazing and would answer any question that I had for my live chats. This course helped lay the foundation that I plan on turning into a career. If your wanting to learn more about being a GM and scouting in the NFL then I highly recommend taking this course.\n\nFootball General Manager and Scouting\n\nDuring my class with SMWW I was able to learn numerous amounts of information on business development and ticket sales. After my class though I stayed heavily involved with SMWW through going to numerous conferences (NBA x2 & NHL) and helping to work them to make sure they were being run smoothly. The best advice that I got through SMWW and Mark Warkentein was to be 1% better each day than the last. If you are someone that is motivated to excel in any career of your choice I believe that SMWW will help prepare you not for just your career, but also you life.\n\nSports Sales and MarketingSports InternshipsVirtual Internship Program\n\nSMWW gives you the chance to get your foot in the door in the competitive world of sports. I took the football GM and scouting course and it was an incredible experience, being able to talk to ESPN Analyst and former Tampa Bay Buccaneers GM Mark Dominik every week along with John Wooten, Russ Lande, and Dr. Lashbrook was absolutely awesome. You get out what you put in when it comes to the courses, so if you want to work in sports and you are committed to working your tail off than I would recommend SMWW to anyone.\n\nFootball General Manager and ScoutingSports Internships\n\nI was in the same position as most college students. I was about to graduate with my degree, yet had no job prospects or an idea of where to start looking. I came across Dr. Lashbrook at a local restaurant here in Portland when he handed me his business card and told me to follow up. I went into the office a few days later and signed up that day to take the Sports Sales and Marketing Course. I also began to intern in the office a few times a week as my schedule permitted. Through SMWW and Dr. Lashbrook, I was able to dive deep into my sports career and look forward to progressing my career.\n\nSports Sales and MarketingSports Internships\n\nChicago Bulls Player Development Coordinator\n\nAs an SMWW alum of Basketball GM & Scouting, the Basketball Career Conference, and Sports Revenue Mgmt course, I am pleased to inform you that I have gotten my first NBA job with the Brooklyn Nets as Player Development and Video Assistant. I thank you for all of the knowledge and networking that SMWW has imparted to me to this point. Thank you again and I hope to continue to ascend the NBA ladder and represent your company well.\n\nBasketball General Manager and Scouting\n\nEntrepreneur and Attorney\n\nJoel, I just found out I passed the NFLPA Certification exam, so I will be able to move forward with my NFL agent venture. I wanted to say thanks so much for your guidance and help in understanding the CBA…you MORE than prepared me! I really say this in a modest way, and complimentary to you, but the exam didn’t seem that difficult and I believe part of the reason is because of how you helped me over-prepare, going through the most difficult scenarios.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nI'm a student in Ari Kaplan's Baseball Analytics Class. We're about halfway through the course and I've already landed my first job in baseball! I logged into the course page last Sunday to post an assignment and I saw a message to all students from SMWW that the Tampa Bay Rays were hiring TrackMan and Pitch f/x Operators for their minor league affiliates. I quickly revised my resume to feature the course description that SMWW provided and applied for the job via TeamWork Online. The very next day I was hired by the Rays Baseball Operations Department to help run TrackMan for one of their minor league clubs that is local to me! They said my resume really stood out, and I attribute most of that to having the SMWW Baseball Analytics course description front and center. So I'd like to say 'thank you' to the whole SMWW crew and I look forward to continuing to study and learn with you. With this new job, my investment has already more than paid for itself. Thanks again, David Yamin\n\nBaseball AnalyticsBaseball Player Development & Strategy\n\nIF Björklöven Hockey Allsvenskan Scout\n\nI wanted to touch base with SMWW as I have been living in Sweden for the past sixteen months. I've been working as a full time scout with IF Björklöven Hockey Allsvenskan since last September. Currently I am one of three full-time scouts in Swedish hockey.\n\nI wanted thank Dr. Lashbrook and the staff at SMWW for all your help. The course opened many doors for me within the hockey community in Edmonton as well the course provided me an opportunity to develop contacts in Sweden and Finland. The course gave me instant credibility when trying to arrange interviews for the course assignment which was the most valuable part of the course.\n\nHaving a background in amateur sport administration but no experience in hockey I am still amazed I have my dream job. I owe it all to SMWW.\n\nHockey General Manager and ScoutingAlumni AssociationHockey Player Development & Strategy\n\nMount St. Joseph\n\nI just wanted to follow up and say thank you for putting on the amazing event last week that was the NFL Combine Career Conference and Networking Event.\n\nI learned more than I can imagine on bothThursday andFriday. Networking with so many professionals and learning from them gave me a lot of insight on the next steps I need to do to go forward into a potential career in sports.\n\nAfter the conference was over you asked if I had decided what I want to do and what career path I want to follow. Well I am 100% sure as of right now I want to go into the field of scouting and/or player personnel. And as soon as my last game as a college football is over...I am registering for the SMWW Football GM and Scouting Course.\n\nI sincerely thank you for everything I gained from this event. The lessons I learned will serve me well in the future. And as you put it, I will \"adrenalize\" today and monetizetomorrow.\n\nFootball Career Conference during the NFL Combine\n\nFC Dallas\n\nThe knowledge I received from the course and awesome facilitators helped me gain my first position as an intern with the Omaha Beef Arena Football Team. While there, I was contacted by several ECHL teams for Account Specialist positions. I was offered multiple jobs and accepted a position with the Wichita Thunder. The knowledge I gained with the Sports Sales and Marketing course definitely catapulted me in front of a lot of people. If you take this course and do ALL the course material you will get a job in sports. Thank you, Dr. Lashbrook!\n\nSports Sales and Marketing\n\nThe NFLPA Agent Certification Course was the 3rd course I have taken with your company - and I wanted to let you know Joel Corry is one of the best of the best. The experience in the class, his attentiveness to our questions throughout the week, everything, beyond my expectation. Felt very confident going into the exam and know without a doubt I wouldn't be in that same mindset without Joel's guidance. I wanted to take the time to let you know, Joel is a great asset to your company, and a great professor.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nDirector of Parks and Recreation\n\nWithout CUC/SMWW I would not be where I am today professionally. This degree has catapulted me in front of other potential candidates for various positions. I was recently hired onto my dream job as the Director of Parks and Recreation for my city. The diverse set of courses offered in this program prepared me for the everyday challenges and various changes in my industry. I would not hesitate to recommend this program to anyone! This program will get you to places you could only dream of and make it a reality!\n\nSports Management Masters Degree\n\nBefore taking this course I was at a complete crossroads I had just finished my MBA in Sports Business Management and I knew where I wanted to go I just didn't know how to get there or even where to start. If I'm honest, even after signing up for this course I was still a little unsure if it was the right path, however over the past eight weeks the Sports Management Worldwide Football/Soccer Agent course has been widely beneficial for me, it has advanced me greatly towards where I want to be in my career and has helped me grow as a person. I now feel confident and a lot more knowledgeable to register as an intermediary and represent professional Football/Soccer players.\n\nSoccer Agent\n\nWhen I first started my doctorate, Dr. Lashbrook and I had a detailed phone conversation covering all the hurdles that awaited and the possible benefits. His compassion and honesty was needed at the time. The SMWW/CUC program was ideal and helped me to become an expert in my field. My research has been implemented at various institutions in Central and South Florida, and I now teach courses in Sports Management and Exercise Sciences at the graduate level.\n\nSports Leadership DegreesSports Leadership Doctorate Degree\n\nConcordia University provided the ideal opportunity for me to gain my Doctor of Education degree in Leadership and Sports Management. And Concordia’s collaborative agreement with Sports Management Worldwide enhanced my experience throughout the program. As an assistant professor at Southwestern Oklahoma State University in the Department of Education\n\nand an instructor of graduate Sports Management classes, I utilize my terminal degree—and the knowledge I gained through CUC and SMWW—each and every day. Under the supervision of my outstanding advisor, Dr. Kathryn Hollywood, I followed my passion, researching methods that applied to my work supervising teacher/coach candidates in secondary schools, and I published “Leadership Behaviors of Effective Interscholastic Athletic Coaches” in 2016.\n\nSports Leadership Doctorate Degree\n\nDirector of Development and Student Activities\n\nI am VERY HAPPY and EXTREMELY PROUD of my experience and degree from SMWW/CUC! Sports management is a rapidly emerging field! The training and education I participated in with SMWW have enabled me to exceed my professional goals. From the scope and depth of the curriculum to the flexibility of the online learning environment, to the expertise shared by the faculty members, SMWW transformed me and encouraged me in a culture of creativity and motivation. Rigorous educational standards, mutually respectful rapport between student and instructor, stimulating dialogue of inquiry and discovery, collaborative, asynchronous approach - SMWW offers an excellent online program! Due to the number of professionals in the athletic realm who are looking for ongoing professional development and training, I believe the partnership between SMWW and Concordia University Chicago will continue to be one of the best in the industry!\n\nSports Leadership DegreesSports Leadership Doctorate Degree\n\nNew York Liberty (WNBA) Head Analytics Coordinator\n\nGetting a job in pro basketball is all about separating yourself from the hundreds of other applicants and NetScouts/SMWW do just that. There's no substitute for being in arenas, seeing players in-person and learning what it means to be a scout on the fly. Building your skillset through courses then applying what you've learned to live game action is invaluable experience. NetScouts/SMWW had a huge role in molding me into a basketball operations professional and I use what I learned during my time in the apprenticeship program to this day.\n\nBasketball Career Conference in Las VegasBasketball AnalyticsBasketball Apprenticeship\n\nSan Tan Legacy Soccer Club\n\nThe SMWW Soccer Scouting and Management course was extremely informative. The audio chats with Matt Martin made it all worth while but the assignments really force you to dig into the game and look at things from a different and more detailed point of view. The course work makes you really learn how hard you are willing to work to achieve success in the industry and is designed to give you the tools to do so!\n\nSoccer/Football Management & Scouting\n\nCal State Stanislaus Head Coach\n\nI have been a Head Collegiate coach in the US for 17 years, have my \"A\" and NSCAA Premier. I have coached PDL and as well as been a State Director of Coaching. I found this course to be beneficial in so many ways and look to incorporate the information I learned on how to scout opponents and players.\n\nSoccer/Football Management & Scouting\n\nFreelance Soccer Scout\n\nThere is no degree or specific formula when it comes to becoming a soccer scout, but SMWW gives you a platform and community to work together and jump right into it. Doing this course is definitely not learning things from a book and reciting the information like a parrot, but rather applying yourself to dig deeper and expressing your own opinions and ideas.\n\nSoccer/Football Management & Scouting\n\nNBA Scout\n\nWorking with the community of Sports Management Worldwide has been great! The assignments are structured very well throughout each 8-week course, but the biggest benefit you receive is the relationships you establish. I have taken two classes so far, and the connections and contacts I have made because of those two are priceless. If you are interested in sports as a profession, or even elevating your understanding/relationships, I highly recommend choosing SMWW.\n\nBasketball Analytics\n\nNew Business Executive at Nashville Predators\n\nBefore I started this course, I had no idea how to get in with a sports organization. Now that I have taken the course I feel that I am well qualified to get my foot in the door with my dream team. Anyone that questions taking SMWW, take the leap and it's something you will not regret!\n\nSports Sales and Marketing\n\nTeam Sports Agency\n\nJoel Corry and the SMWW Agent Certification Course in one word, 'methodical'. Joel's approach to studying makes it easier to understand the Collective Bargaining Agreement, a complex document. I now have an in-depth understanding of the CBA and it is a big reason why I am an Agent today. I am extremely grateful to Joel. His reputation of being a great agent carries over to being a great teacher. The class is a game changer and felt fortunate to have had Joel in my corner prior to the test.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nDirector, Quality & Regulatory Affairs: Specialty Businesses\n\nJust a quick note of gratitude. I'm both a pharmacist and an attorney, which means I am no stranger to licensing exams (6 total licenses across 4 states). I absolutely mean it when I say, without your course there is NO way I could have passed the nflpa exam. But thanks to you, I can now say I am a certified nfl player agent (pending registration fee and insurance of course!) Thanks again for all of the assistance, and I wish you continued success in all of your future endeavors!\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nCo Founder at True Sports Management\n\nI found out the other day that I passed the exam, and I just wanted to send you a quick email and say how helpful your class was in getting me prepared to take the exam. I would not have had the amount of preparation necessary to pass if I did not take your course. The test definitely lived up to the hype as far as difficulty, but with the prep work we did in class it was no problem.\n\nFootball Agent Certification Prep\n\nBasketball Administrator Sports Administrator\n\nI was a volunteer at the FIBA World Champs back in 2010 in Turkey, when I decided to take the Sports Admin course at SMWW. That's how I met the amazing Dr. Krause. A legend, with an invaluable knowledge and experience in both the athletic and administrative side of sports. Thanks to his wisdom and guidance, I have created my exciting career in sports administration all around the world. I am now working at Basketball Australia, and still following the same pathway that Dr. Krause enlightens.\n\nSports Administration\n\nAston Villa\n\nAfter completing the Soccer Management and Scouting course, I gained the knowledge and skills professional clubs require to assess players and teams. The course allowed me to understand how to analyze a soccer game and put what I see in the game down onto paper. Before the course, I watched soccer as a fan, but now I see the game from a scout's perspective. Thanks to SMWW for helping me kick-start my career. I am now working in my dream job - a European scout for Aston Villa FC.\n\nSoccer/Football Management & Scouting\n\nMilwaukee Brewers Video Scout\n\nSMWW's Baseball GM & Scouting course taught me a lot of the little things that go into scouting and working in the baseball operations side of the front office, which would of been very difficult to learn outside of this class. Larry D'Amato and Dan Evans are great teachers and provided everything they know to me in just 8 weeks. They truly care about the future of everyone in the class. I want to thank both of them and Lynn Lashbrook, as all this material I leaned will help me immensely moving forward in my career.\n\nBaseball General Manager and Scouting\n\nTrackMan\n\nI had no idea what to expect when I started this course. I thought that if I were to learn at least one thing about baseball it would be worth it. I ended up learning so much more than expected. That has everything to do with the great teachers SMWW was able to get to teach the courses. All of them are willing to help you in you start your career in baseball if you show the work ethic and passion for the game.\n\nBaseball General Manager and ScoutingBaseball AnalyticsSports AnalyticsBaseball Player Development & Strategy\n\nThousand Oaks, CA\n\nI chose to get up at 2am my time to participate in the live audio chats because they were so informative and I didn’t want to miss anything! This course is a huge advantage when it comes time to me moving my club forward. There is a lot of useful information when it comes to marketing. I definitely feel I now have an advantage to those who only play the sport. It's a great tool for making contacts and connections to advance my career to the next level.\n\nRugby Business Management\n\nMens Head Coach, Cal State Stanislaus\n\nI have been a Head Collegiate coach in the US for 17 years, have my \"A\" and NSCAA Premier.

I would recommend it for every NCAA Division 1 Coach.\n\nSoccer Career Conference at the NWSL Draft & United Coaches Soccer Convention\n\nSMWW's VIP program was literally a miracle for me. I found myself almost done with a master's degree and only needing an internship, but I was a stay at home mom, in a small community with no options for an in person internship unless I moved, which really wasn't an option.\n\nWith approval from my school,The Sports Academy, I was able to enroll with SMWW and take three of the courses and attend one of their conferences. This program replaced my in person internship and allowed me to interact with real life professionals in the sports industry, learn from some of the best teachers and become a part of a great family.\n\nIn today's technology filled world SMWW stands out and above the rest by offering this option to students around the world.\n\nVirtual Internship Program\n\nBoston Celtics Video Cordinator\n\nThe Basketball GM and Scouting course was a huge help in me getting started at the Boston Celtics. I had several interviews, and in each case, after my resume was reviewed I was asked to discuss my training through the Basketball GM & Scouting Course. I believe the Celtics knew I was serious when they saw I had taken this course on my own, outside of my regular college courses. The course showed me ways to view the game from different levels beyond a fan's perspective. Each week during the chats, I spoke with influential members of the basketball world, and these conversations taught me how to handle myself in an NBA environment.\n\nBasketball General Manager and Scouting\n\nApollo Sports Agents, Licensed Players' Agent by the FA\n\nI attended the Soccer Agent Course from September to December 2009.

As a result, I am currently pursuing a career in scouting and the course has already opened doors for me.\n\nHockey General Manager and Scouting\n\nThis website has really shown me the hidden door behind sports marketing.
