        "text": "*Repost due to technical difficulties* I promised myself that I wouldn't create a sappy social post about my time at the NRECA Connect Conference 2024. Since I've been back, it is the only thing I can think about, so here goes nothing. Throughout my career, I have had the hardest time finding my footing. Opportunities have come and gone with no return on investment. I haven't found a place I could call home. It is thanks to Itasca-Mantrap Electric Cooperative that I have found the feeling I've been longing for. I would like to coin a phrase that I learned from a new connection, colleague, and friend. That phrase is \"finding your people,\" and that is exactly what I found at Connect in Baltimore. I have never felt more accepted into a group of bright individuals (pun intended). While I could go on about how amazing my experience was, I will end with this. Thank you to everyone who took time out of their day to speak with me during the conference. And thank you to the amazing group of friends I've made along the way. To \"The Agency,\" I miss you guys, and I look forward to seeing you all again. While my time in the cooperative field is just beginning, the memories I made are ones I will never forget."
