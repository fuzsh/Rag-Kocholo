        "text": "Diego Simeone will be looking to bolster his squad before the start of next season but to do so he will need to sell some of his players first in order to muster up the cash, which has been limited due to the financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, The Argentinean manager seems to be a dab hand at raising funds for his club, making an astounding 860.9 million Euros since taking charge of Atletico Madrid back in 2012.\n\nAtletico know how to sell well and are currently ranked fifth place in the world for transfer income only behind Chelsea, Monaco, Juventus and Benfica.\n\nMARCA has reviewed each season's transfers since the arrival of Diego Simeone to Atletico Madrid.\n\n2011/12 season\n\nThe first player sold by Diego Simeone in the January transfer window of 2012 was Jose Antonio Reyes for 3.5 million euros back to his home club of Sevilla.\n\nThis was the start of 56 million euros produced later on that year.\n\n2012/13 season\n\nHis second season saw him sell Eduardo Salvio (10m euros), Alvaro Dominguez (8m euros) and Emre Belozoglu (350,000 euros) for a combined total of 19.35 million euros.\n\n2013/14 season\n\nThe season that saw Radamel Falcao leave the Rojiblancos for Monaco for a fee of 43 million euros also saw another five players leave Madrid for pastures new: Pizzi (14m euros), Martin Demichelis (5m euros), Ruben Micael (3m euros) and Joel Robles (4m euros).\n\nLeo Baptistao was also loaned to Real Betis for a fee of 1.6 million euros bringing the years earnings to a total of 70.6 million euros.\n\nThe club spent just 36 million euros that year, which was enough to secure them the LaLiga title.\n\n2014/15 season\n\nThe mass exodus after winning the title in 2013-2014 season saw the Rojiblancos scoop 89.3 million euros in total with the sales of Diego Costa (36m euros), Filipe Luis (20m euros), Adrian Lopez (11m euros) and goalkeepers Roberto Jimenez (6m euros) and Sergio Asenjo (5m euros).\n\n2015/16 season\n\nThis season saw Atletico Madrid break their spending record by parting ways with 143.55 million euros but they also broke their sales record too after receiving 164.4 million euros.\n\nJackson Martinez flopped at Atletico and left in the winter for China a year later for 42 million euros, making a seven million euro profit for Atletico.\n\nArda Turan also left for Barcelona for a fee 34 million euros in the hunt for a Champions League title that never came.\n\nOther players that left that year included: Mario Mandzukic (23.4m euros), Raul Jimenez (22m euros), Toby Alderweireld (16m euros), Mario Suarez (15m euros), Raul Garcia (8m euros) and Miranda (4m euros).\n\n2016/17 season\n\nAfter being sanctioned by FIFA, Atletico got rid of some of their fringe players.\n\nBorja Baston left for Swansea City for 18 million euros, whilst Leo Baptistao went to Espanyol for seven million euros.\n\nOther players that concluded the exodus this season were Josh Guilavogui (8m euros) and both Luciano Vietto and Matias Kranevitter for a combined fee of five million euros from Sevilla.\n\n2017/18 season\n\nThe biggest departure this season was French defender, Theo Hernandez.\n\nWithout even making his debut for Atletico, he left for bitter rivals Real Madrid for 24 million euros.\n\nOliver Torres also left the club for 20 million euros as well as Yannick Carrasco (10m euros), Augusto Fernandez (4.5m euros), Nico Gaitan (5.5m euros), Javier Manquillo (5m euros) Santos Borre (3m euros) and Amath Ndiaye (3m euros).\n\n2018/19 season\n\nThe last season at the Wanda Metropolitano saw Atletico Madrid make 64.9 million euros by selling players.\n\nGameiro was sold to Valencia for 16 million euros and Vrsaljko was loaned to Inter for 6.5 million euros.\n\nOther players that left this season weas Diogo Jota (14m euros) and Pierre-Kunde Malong (7m euros) and Bernard Mensah who was loaned out to Getafe for 400,000 euros.\n\n2019/20 season\n\nLast season saw the records broken again with a number of big names leaving Atletico Madrid for huge transfer fees.\n\nAtletico made a total of 312.8 million euros on sales with 120 million euros of that coming from the departure of Antoine Griezmann although 24 million of that price tag had to go to Real Sociedad.\n\nOther players to leave the club last season were: Lucas Hernandez to Bayern for 80 million euros, Rodri (70m euros), Gelson Martins (30m euros), Luciano Vietto (7.5m euros) and Bernard Mensah (2.8m euros)\n\nLoans moves for Nikola Kalinic (2m euros) and Caio Henrique (500,000) also added a little extra to the total sum earned by Atletico.\n\nUndoubtedly the selling gene is in Atletico's DNA and if it continues, there is no doubt we will see fresh new talent playing for the Rojiblancos in the future."
