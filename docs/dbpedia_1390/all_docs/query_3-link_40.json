        "text": "Latest Columns\n\nTexas could suffer if the U.S. keeps out refugees like me\n\nIt’s hard to imagine where I’d be if the U.S. hadn’t welcomed me, or if I’d even be alive. And yet today, our country is welcoming fewer refugees than ever. Nationally, we’ve reached the lowest level in nearly forty years, and Texas saw a 79% decrease in refugee resettlement between 2017 and 2018.\n\nOh no, hordes on the border!\n\nImmigration is our story of origin, the heroic journey taken by our forebears, including those of the First Nations, whose ancestors had to cross the Bering Straits land bridge to get here. Immigration enlists all of the energy, imagination, and most of all, the courage and determination of those who undertake it when their present circumstances fall short.\n\nSome pointed questions on immigration for U.S. policymakers\n\nEveryone should recognize the obvious truth: to let people earn legal status by working and paying taxes. This could be a long and difficult path, but one that immigrants of good will would find possible.\n\nBanning refugees is immoral, un-American and likely lethal\n\nRefugees need our help, and they need it today. Stand up for our world’s most vulnerable people and reinvigorate the values that make America truly great. The futures of thousands of families depend on how we respond at this critical moment.\n\nImmigrant workers are why my health care business has grown\n\nIf we limit immigration, we limit our base of prospective employees, and I would hate to see a hiring shortage prevent me from serving our clients.\n\nThe silent victims of zero-tolerance immigration policies\n\nThe best way to protect immigrant children with disabilities to keep them with their guardians. Family separation is a cruel policy with particularly harsh consequences for children with disabilities.\n\nWelcome to the United States\n\nLike most people, my wife and I have been following the news from the border with a mix of worry, outrage, and helplessness. Separated families. Human beings corralled behind fences and under bridges. Children dying. And no doubt, innumerable tragedies that never even make it into the news.\n\nKeep families together and treat immigrants humanely\n\nAt first glance, it appears to be a thinly veiled political talking point aimed at smearing the border and immigrants, a message in support of the president's re-election campaign theme. But in the end, the only truly bipartisan element of the resolution passed by the Texas Senate addressed the need to treat immigrants with compassion and humanity.\n\nTexas should encourage the right to vote â and protect voters from intimidation\n\nRecently, state officials announced that a number of individuals voted in elections without the requisite citizenship, knowing the data was not yet reviewed or vetted. There is not a problem of non-citizens registering and voting in Texas — there is a data problem. Even worse, government officials purposely took advantage of that known data problem to plant doubt about the integrity of the voting system.\n\nWall of platitudes\n\nA poem\n\nFor me, immigration to the U.S. meant âwinning the lotteryâ\n\nThe stereotypical immigrant/refugee to the U.S. — someone from Mexico or Central America — is only a part of the picture. Although Albanians like me don’t look like the “caravan” nomads clamoring at our southern border these days, I understand their desire for a better future and believe in their quest. It is no different than mine.\n\nProposed federal rule could penalize legal immigrants, like my parents\n\nThis is a nation of immigrants, and many Americans can trace their ancestry back to a grandparent or great-grandparent who came here from another country, excited by the American promise that hard work would lead to success. Families like mine that have arrived more recently are no different.\n\nMy parents fled Central America to protect our safety. Itâs what any good parent would do.\n\nWhen I see the images of Central American migrants now heading to the United States seeking asylum, I see people who are trying to escape extreme poverty and violence — people just like my parents. They are trying to survive; they want their children to live.\n\nThe magic of the Rio Grande\n\nMy family’s trajectory is in many ways the story of South Texas. Non-citizens becoming citizens and forming families that bear generation after generation of Americans. This is the magic of the Rio Grande. Lately, people want to build walls on this river where I grew up.\n\nAs the Trump administration turns its back on refugees, Texas stands ready to welcome them\n\nOur nation’s cross-section of faith-based and secular organizations are on standby, ready to take in more vulnerable people. Now it’s up to our government to step up and do the right thing.\n\nAlienation, legal process and our southern border\n\nThe federal government has just announced its latest salvo in its ongoing war on asylum seekers, proposing rules that would allow children to be held in immigration detention for prolonged periods of time. The rules would undermine our legal obligations to refugees and strike a particularly vulnerable population: asylum-seeking children.\n\nIf Texans want growth, then we need immigrants\n\nImmigrants have always made this country strong, and they will continue to. But only if we let them.\n\nReaching immigrant families during their darkest times\n\nBy galvanizing local support, my community and I were able to come together and create an impact that transcends borders. These immigrants need our support more than ever. It’s time for us to fight for justice and humanity.\n\nU.S. immigration politics donât sync with American ideals\n\nI believe it would be a privilege for the United States to accept these brave migrants — the men, women and children who have encountered rape, assault, robbery, miles of walking — all for the chance of being able to live and work here. They show up to the door of Casanicolás gentle, kind and grateful. What more could our nation ask of its potential citizens?\n\nWeâre the land of the free. Are we still a beacon of hope?\n\nOn a recent fact-finding mission to the U.S.-Mexico border, I was heartbroken that the stories of new immigrants are often much worse than we’ve heard. Along with a group of fellow veterans, I travelled to El Paso and Juarez to see the situation firsthand and meet the families that are being ripped apart on our border.\n\nEthical responsibility and pride in America\n\nThe mission of the Grannies was to travel to McAllen to shed light on the immigrant atrocities our current administration has created at the border. When children are caged in detention facilities that resemble concentration camps, when children are neglected and abused in these facilities, when their desperate parents are treated as criminals, in my book these are atrocities.\n\nNo one trained me for this\n\nNo one trained me for what I am doing as an immigration attorney in the family separation crisis: talking about horrific crimes against humanity in Central America and then learning the details of my own government’s purposeful actions to traumatize asylum-seekers.\n\nFear, hope and immigration\n\nAs an immigrant free from fear, I cannot stand idly as others are threatened and assailed. Immigrants, regardless of classification and throughout history, craft the American story. The greatest privilege I live with has been the ability to play one small part in it. I dream that many others may join this story too, free from fear and ferried by hope.\n\nAre we keeping faith with international students?\n\nMany of America’s influential leaders in business, government, industry, medicine and research began as international students; some worked long and hard to become citizens. The hubris required to think the country better off without such seekers is a particularly backward and dangerous one and would result in a needless and tragic loss.\n\nSeparated families and the urgency of the ticking clock\n\nToxic stress is about the ticking clock of persistent biological disruptions in the absence of a supportive caregiver. The biology of adversity, common sense and human decency all converge around two powerful conclusions: Reunite every child and parent immediately; and provide coordinated treatment for both of them together to begin to heal the damage that we have done.\n\nAmericans â and American values â support immigration and compromise\n\nPerhaps this president might find more success with immigration reform — which both sides would likely agree is necessary — if he stopped attacking Democrats and instead looked to find common ground for meaningful, effective immigration reform that upholds core values Americans on both sides of the aisle share, like opportunity, equality and basic human decency.\n\nWe are better than this\n\nWe can still change the trajectory for the thousands of vulnerable immigrant children being apprehended at the border. Children should not be separated from their parents, and they should not be subjected to living in prison-like settings.\n\nAbolitionist resistance and âzero toleranceâ\n\nTexans who are dispirited by recent immigration policy changes can be heartened by the moral courage of the abolitionists who came before them, resisting and even disobeying inhumane laws. They recognized the inequalities and injustices of their country, spoke out on behalf of the vulnerable and mobilized change — even if that change was still a long time coming.\n\nResisting family separation and family detention in South Texas\n\nIf the administration’s goal is to punish migrants and steam roll them out of the United States, Port Isabel is an ideal prison to effectuate the president’s vision. But if this country wants to retain some semblance of respect for the people who have dared to seek a better life here, then turning to Port Isabel is ludicrous.\n\nA government attack on immigrant women and children\n\nAs a result of Trump’s executive order, women fleeing domestic violence will be incarcerated as they undergo interviews, file appeals, and attempt to make their case to immigration judges. And they now have a significantly lower likelihood of success, especially because most will proceed without legal representation.\n\nFamily values donât stop at the border\n\nFamily unity is enshrined in international law, and the United States has protected this fundamental human right for decades. But we seem to have gone astray as the Trump administration separates immigrant children from their parents — a tactic employed to deter asylum seekers while at the same time creating leverage to fund a border wall in Congress.\n\nMothers and the resistance\n\nSo long as we still have our civil rights, we bear the patriotic responsibility to act and defy these gross human rights violations. Join a local protest and demand the immediate reunification of detained immigrant families and the end of family separations.\n\nThe long history of child detention\n\nIt seems clear that the Trump administration was caught thoroughly unprepared to implement its own “zero tolerance” policy. In the ensuing scramble to house children ranging in age from infants to adolescents, the administration has relied on hastily built tent cities, retrofitted WalMart stores and, most revealingly, existing facilities typically used to house juvenile offenders.\n\nHow public attitudes are shaping Texas GOP leadersâ response to Trump border policy\n\nResults from the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll illuminate how public attitudes provide the context for the political and policy responses of Texas’ elected leaders to President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy on immigration on the U.S.—Mexico border.\n\nWorld Refugee Day should be a day to take action\n\nTragically, the long-standing processes and programs that serve all of these vulnerable groups of refugees have come under attack over the past 18 months. And ironically, most of these programs were developed to help make the U.S. immigration process more orderly and manageable.\n\nTaking care of kids â not separating them\n\nThe president’s order ending family separations is a good first step. But there will be more for our elected officials and everyday citizens to do. In the coming weeks, we will call on our neighbors and community members to participate in an advisory forum to lend their voices to help answer the question of where we go from here.\n\nPublic schools are no place for immigration enforcement\n\nDistrust leads families to not send children to school, to volunteer or to interact with educators. Immigration enforcement in schools ultimately affects both citizen and undocumented families alike, as the increased likelihood of deportation and family separation forces an especially vulnerable population of children to deal with pervasive fear and uncertainty.\n\nMotherâs Day in Dilley\n\nWhen we incarcerate mothers, we incarcerate their families, their dreams and their aspirations for a better life. Detention is not the solution, and we have taken it upon ourselves to help more people understand that.\n\nTrumpâs National Guard deployment is based on falsehoods\n\nWhile there may be merit in having the National Guard provide systems of support for Customs and Border Protection, the premises under which the troops were deployed were based on falsehoods about unauthorized persons and the immigrant community.\n\nThe new refugees\n\nAs a professor, researcher, and volunteer, I have met with hundreds of forced migrants from Central America and Mexico over the past decade. What I have learned is that they do not see that they had a choice in the matter; their survival and family well-being depended on getting away from cities like San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, Honduras or San Salvador, El Salvador.\n\nICEâs policy for detention of pregnant immigrants is a new low\n\nGoing out of its way to change a policy that saved taxpayer dollars and spared pregnant women the hardship of detention is a new low, even for this administration. It means that pregnant women will be less likely to find lawyers to represent them in court, to receive support from their family members and community and to access the medical care they need.\n\nEverybody in Dallas came from someplace else\n\nWhen the dean of the University of Michigan’s business school, (which now has a Sam Wyly Hall), asked me how his state can be more like Texas, I told him, “Texas is immigrant-friendly, whether you’re from New York, California or Timbuktu.”\n\nSen. Cornyn should support immigration compromise\n\nU.S. Sen. John Cornyn knows the urgency of this situation, and he knows the contributions Dreamers can make to our country if Congress gives them the chance. He’s acknowledged the only path forward is a narrow bill. That’s now been offered.\n\nIn Texas, we are all America\n\nLast year was marked by division and strife, but 2018 does not have to repeat this pattern. This year, let us all stand in solidarity with the survivors and refugees of war and genocide, and together make it a year of unity, cooperation and compassion.\n\nA DACA solution would be good for Texas â and the country\n\nAmericans and Texans are tired of partisan gridlock and there should not be anything political about protecting individuals who are making positive contributions to the nation’s economy and communities throughout Texas. For that reason, we support the efforts of U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, Sen. John Cornyn and others who are seeking to forge a bipartisan, permanent solution to the DACA issue.\n\nSenseless delays on DACA decision harms students and schools\n\nThe story of Dreamers is the story of so many San Antonians before them — hopeful immigrants with a dogged determination to build a brighter future here, ambitious doers eager to contribute. And the story of San Antonio is the story of America — a land of immigrants whose contributions have enhanced its culture and boosted its prosperity.\n\nTexans should take note of Virginiaâs stand against hate\n\nIt is time for Texans to stand up against hate. We do not have to wait until next November’s gubernatorial election in our state. We can do it now by speaking out against Texas Senate Bill 4, the racial-profiling law that is being challenged in the courts, and other policies that have turned our state into Trump’s deportation machine.\n\nTexas â all of it â belongs on the U.S. side of a border wall\n\nThe simple fact is that you can't build a wall in the middle of a river. So the proposed border wall will be built up to two miles inland on Texas soil. It will place thousands of Texas acres, nature parks and even parts of towns on the Mexican side of the fence. In reality, it is sure to separate American citizens from America.\n\nKeep DACA, and keep the kids\n\nChildren do not choose to become undocumented immigrants. The decisions made by their parents to bring them to the United States without legal documentation should not be held against them.\n\nHow I talk to my high school students about DACA\n\nCould you stand in my shoes and tell my students, who have only known the U.S. as home, that they don't belong in this country?\n\nMexicans in the U.S. deserve human rights, just as Americans do in Mexico\n\nThe nativist posturing of President Donald Trump and Texas’ enactment of Senate Bill 4 have caused fear and great anxiety for Latinos in the United States.\n\nClements v. Abbott: A New Party Line on Refugee Resettlement\n\nNo other governor in modern Texas history has had the same hardline stance on refugee resettlement as Gov. Greg Abbott. But one other dealt with a refugee crisis as polarizing and tumultuous: Bill Clements.\n\nWe are failing our immigrant children\n\nAs Texans, we are failing our immigrant children. Senate Bill 4, the anti-sanctuary cities bill signed into law this past session, places a burden on law enforcement officers to act as immigration agents. Similar to show-me-your-papers bills that were passed in Arizona and Alabama, SB 4 jeopardizes the trust between law enforcement and community members, instills fear and anxiety in children and their families, and is likely to have detrimental effects on the economic prosperity of our state.\n\nWhy weÂ needÂ to welcome refugees\n\nOur divergent relationships with refugees have been on high-profile display even as we experience the largest waves of displaced people the world has seen in modern times — due in large measure to the tragic civil conflict in Syria. Yet as the U.S. and other world nations pause to commemorate World Refugee Day on June 20, one simple fact continues to be overlooked: We in America need to welcome refugees.\n\nWhy I celebrate Immigrant Heritage Month\n\nIt’s easy to get wrapped up in conversations about policy and the system as a whole, but we cannot forget that how we choose to address immigration as a country is also personal: It directly affects the lives of millions of people.\n\nPardon the disturbance, but we refuse to be silent\n\nThis isn’t about decorum. I’m a sailor; I can take the salty language. This is about whether we sit idly or stand up in the face of ethnic scapegoating, racial profiling and abusing the power of the state to intimidate the less powerful.\n\nâSanctuaryâ law will make Texans less secure, less safe\n\nThe state's new anti-sanctuary law will allow local law enforcement and other government officials to inquire about a person’s immigration status during unrelated interactions. This turns every interaction with a government official into a potential cause for deportation.\n\nI canât wait to see the state of Texas in court\n\nIf this sanctuary cities law goes into effect, Austin and other Texas cities will be forced to make our communities less safe. And we’re speaking out even though this new law would, incredibly enough, allow our state attorney general to remove local elected officials from office if they endorse a different policy, even one that’s in accordance with federal immigration law.\n\nTexas may have ceded huge business benefits to California with sanctuary cities law\n\nOne can conclude that the new anti-sanctuary cities law oppresses undocumented immigrants. The far-right members of the Texas Legislature seem set towards further persecuting a group of people whose presence benefits a number of huge labor-intensive industries in Texas from agriculture to energy, and their actions are gaining notice.\n\nOpen letter to Wendy, Lizbeth, Janie, Sergio and the children affected by SB 4\n\nWhen I saw you, my thoughts went back to something that happened to my own ancestors many years ago, during slavery — when families were torn apart, children were sold and taken away from their families. Husbands and wives were separated.\n\nCritical links between health care and immigration in Texas\n\nThe passage of SB 4 alongside impending federal health care reform should wake up Texas’ health and immigration leaders to the very real implications of the intersections of their fields. These leaders should catalyze a lifesaving public dialogue to reform health care delivery and fight against dangerous health and immigration policies.\n\nArrogance of power at Texas Capitol must be stopped\n\nAs the Texas Legislature finishes the anti-sanctuary cities bill, Senate Bill 4, one question keeps going through my mind: When did it become so easy for the Republican-controlled leadership to ride roughshod over people like me and those who represent the interests of the Latino and immigrant communities?\n\nA STEM skills day of reckoning\n\nYes, our immigration system is flawed and needs reform. Our elected representatives in Washington are right to want to improve and review federal programs to ensure they are working in the best interests of all Americans. But ignoring the needs of our economy by denying American companies access to global talent runs the risk of moving those jobs and even entire companies abroad — taking wages, tax base and innovation with them to competing markets.\n\nWhat Octavio Paz can tell us about U.S.-Mexico relations today\n\nOctavio Paz’s solution to American democratic problems was to return to the past. The U.S. has to recuperate its unity, which today, in this highly divided world, seems idealistic and complex. And America needs to return to “the origins, to the foundation of the nation. To recuperate the vision of its founders, not to copy them, but to make a new beginning.”\n\nSeparating women and children at the border would be bad for them, and for Texas\n\nIn looking to build a Texas that leads the country with a strong economy, we must ensure we’re giving children strong starts. Separating children from their families will not only inhibit children’s healthy development but incur long-term costs to Texas citizens for untreated mental health issues.\n\nSouth Texas to Trump: If you want our land to build a wall, come and take it\n\nRegardless of one’s policy views, it’s important to understand that border wall litigation will be protracted and expensive, driving up the ultimate cost of the wall, likely to be borne by American taxpayers. Indeed, no matter the results of each trial, the government will owe money to the landowner — the question is just how much.\n\nKeep Texans safe by securing the Mexican border\n\nEnforcing immigration law is the responsibility of federal law enforcement, but that does not mean Texas officials should be limited to making a phone call and hoping federal agents show up in a timely manner. This session, the Legislature must give law enforcement officers the authority, under state law, to arrest, detain, and charge individuals who cross our Southern border illegally.\n\nFamily Court is no place for ICE\n\nFor ICE agents to detain someone in family court when she is seeking an order of protection against her abuser flies directly in the face of both the letter and the spirit of these laws and punishes the very victims these laws were designed to protect.\n\nWe used to talk about immigrants this way âÂ nearly a century ago\n\nWhen we turn our backs on refugees — in this present case, the Syrians who have suffered all the plagues of Job and more in the last few years — we commit an unpardonable act of inhumanity. We also weaken and degrade our country by falling victim to today’s version of Klanspeak, which seeks to demonize all immigrants who fall into certain religious or ethnic categories.\n\nI, too, am America\n\nOurs is just one of many success stories that make Texas and the U.S. what they are today. Immigrants and refugees like those trying to come to our cities now share similar struggles and aspirations. They are not trying to harm us; they seek to make America their home.\n\nSanctuary City Politics: Wolves in Sheepâs Clothing\n\nTexas residents may feel safer as a result of this destructive legislation, but it will not be long before they will also feel the consequences of a vanishing immigrant community in terms of higher prices, labor shortages and a stagnating economy.\n\nWhy President Trump is Wrong About Refugees\n\nThis executive order also undermines America's principles of fair and equal treatment of all people around the world regardless of race, religion or country of origin — core tenants of the U.S. Constitution and the founding of our country.\n\nOutlawing sanctuary cities protects Texans\n\nWe cannot allow local governments to pick and choose the laws they want to enforce.\n\n\"Welcoming\" Houston is also deportation capital\n\nTwo months before Houston became a \"Welcoming City,\" Interim Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman quietly renewed the 287(g) program, which deputizes local law enforcement to screen for undocumented immigrants using the Immigration and Customs Enforcement database.\n\nWhat should Texas spend on border security under Trump? Nada.\n\nWith a Trump presidency and Republican-controlled Congress committed to securing the border, the question must be asked: Why should the Texas Legislature be in the border security business at all?\n\nTexas should end \"sanctuary cities\"\n\nSanctuary policies endanger public safety, fuel illegal immigration, waste millions of dollars and conflict with federal law.\n\nTexans will not abandon refugees in their hour of need\n\nThe thousands of compassionate Texans who have helped resettle refugees for over four decades in the Lone Star State — citizen volunteers, people of faith, community groups and social service professionals — will not abandon them in their hour of need.\n\nTime to get serious about securing the Texas border\n\nOur nation needs the political courage necessary to ensure America's borders are secured in a way that stops the drug traffickers, human smugglers, waves of illegal immigrants and, God forbid, terrorist infiltrators from taking advantage of this vulnerable situation.\n\nEnd mass incarceration of refugees in Texas\n\nHistory will harshly judge mass incarceration of Central American refugees. Texans should not stand by as it takes place in our backyard.\n\nThe Problem with the Declaration of Independence\n\nImmigrants like me continue to see opportunity in the inspiring words of the Declaration of Independence. But those same words can also represent a big obstacle toward making the United States a welcoming country.\n\nTexasâ strong economic growth is a cause â and effect â of immigration\n\nThe reflexive anger some people have toward immigration is easy to understand, but it doesn't really comport with reality.\n\nIllegal immigrants should not receive taxpayer-subsidized attorneys\n\nBy guaranteeing a taxpayer-subsidized attorney for their civil proceeding, Sen. Harry Reid's new bill would effectively give illegal immigrants greater rights than citizens.\n\nWhat Pope Francis' visit means for Texas\n\nPope Francis, who will visit Ciudad Juárez on Wednesday, has decreed 2016 the Jubilee Year of Mercy. With all the unpleasant politics and xenophobia rampant in Texas today, our state leaders could stand to be more merciful.\n\nDeferred action gives immigrants a chance at the American Dream\n\nToday marks the first anniversary of President Barack Obama’s immigration actions. For me, the anniversary is personal.\n\nAbbott's stand against sanctuary cities protects communities\n\nThe statistics do not lie: During the last two decades, Texas has experienced a material increase in human trafficking, kidnapping, extortion and drug-related homicide as a direct result of increased illegal immigration.\n\nAbbott's campaign against sanctuary cities is misguided\n\nOne reason for Texas' success is our hardworking and productive immigrant population — a fact Gov. Greg Abbott not only ignores but seeks to distort for political purposes.\n\nTexas violates 14th amendment in denying birth certificates\n\nThe 14th Amendment to the Constitution makes clear that Texas has an obligation to make sure all children who are born in this state have a birth certificate issued shortly after birth — even those of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe audacity of Pope\n\nToo often, politicians use religion to demonize certain ideas or people, but ignore what Pope Francis asks us to do, “protecting the vulnerable” and “committing ourselves to the conscious and responsible care of our common home.”\n\nDon't kill Texas' immigrant spirit\n\nTexas celebrates ethnic diversity and empowers newcomers to become prosperous citizens. In the final days of the legislative session, lawmakers should oppose any bills that seek to change that.\n\nTexas' \"border security\" strategy is anything but conservative\n\nThe state's approach to securing the border is the very definition of throwing money at a trumped-up issue that helps politicians win elections but serves no public policy purpose.\n\nAfter judge's ruling, lives left in limbo\n\nA federal judge's decision to block President Obama's immigration actions has left the lives and dignity of real Texans hanging in the balance. Here are two of their stories.\n\n2015: An agenda for immigration\n\nComplicated politics, challenging policy and changing demographics — that's immigration in Texas. And that's why we're in for another interesting legislative session this year.\n\nThe case against Obama's immigration action\n\nWith the stroke of his pen, President Obama has managed to unilaterally tear a fissure in our country's constitutional foundation.\n\nThe case for Obama's immigration action\n\nWith Congress refusing to fix a broken system, now is the time to make the American dream a possibility for hard-working immigrants, as it was made possible for me nearly three decades ago.\n\nReal reform starts with more visas\n\nThe Pentagon last week extended a program designed to bolster our military with more foreign-born recruits. That's a good thing. But we need more new citizens in every occupation and at all skill levels if we want the U.S. to be able to compete.\n\nDetaining immigrant families is shameful\n\nOnly five years after the Obama administration did the right thing and ended the barbaric practice of detaining families at Texas' T. Don Hutto Residential Center, we return to our unfortunate past.\n\nCruz's big lie about the border\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz has woven a tapestry of small lies and half-truths into a full-cloth fabrication about immigration and the border.\n\nWhy I welcome the National Guard to my town\n\nAs the mayor of Rio Grande City, I've seen firsthand how the recent influx of immigrants has overwhelmed local law enforcement. We need all the help we can get.\n\nImmigrants deserve better than Obama\n\nCongress is ready to act on the still-festering border crisis, but the president and Democrats won’t let us. And the thousands of children at risk of abuse and violence are bearing the burden.\n\nWhat's next for Washington on the border crisis\n\nThere’s a human cost to Congress' and the president's inaction on our immigration woes. I’ll keep pushing for a fast, fair process that brings children home to their families as soon as possible.\n\nA rancher on the border of fear and compassion\n\nI admit that my views about immigration are complicated — influenced by tragedy and terror. But I know that we fear what we don't understand. And we as Americans must now seek to understand.\n\nWhat history can teach us about the border crisis\n\nThe deployment of National Guard troops to the border was the right decision, and I have complete faith in our military forces. But as border woes mount, we must remember the lessons of the past.\n\nThe case for compassion at the border\n\nOur immigration system is overwhelmed and needs to be fixed, but is there no place for mercy? People who just want a safe place to work and raise their families aren't a threat to our nation. They're an asset.\n\nA small-business owner's recipe for reform\n\nCall me a hypocrite, but I don't support amnesty for all. As an immigrant and owner of a successful restaurant, however, I realize that we all need a helping hand sometimes. Here's how I would change the system.\n\nWe can do better, Gov. Perry\n\nWe can follow our conscience and calmly accept the migrant children on the border in their hour of need. Or we can do what the governor has done: sensationalize a humanitarian crisis and prey on fears.\n\nNo end to crisis means Texas must act alone\n\nAfter letting the crisis on the border fester for over a month, Washington is still barely doing anything to stem the tide of migrant children entering our country. Texas must act on its own now.\n\nWhat's really happening on the border\n\nThe humanitarian effort on the Texas border has thrust the Rio Grande Valley into the spotlight, but the media coverage hasn't told the whole story. Here's what it actually looks like on the ground.\n\nBorder crisis is a test of Texans' faith\n\nOur diverse faith traditions teach us to welcome our brothers and sisters with love and compassion, regardless of their place of birth. Texas’ future is tied to how we help these new immigrants become a part of our story.\n\nExtremists are destroying our party\n\nI was once hopeful for the future of the Texas GOP. But at our recent convention, the approval of a humiliating platform plank exposed the charlatans leading our party."
