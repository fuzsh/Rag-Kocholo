        "text": "CASE SUMMARIES\n\nThe Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. Moline Builders, Inc. (N.D. Ohio)\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the court issued an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants in Ability Center, et al. v. Moline Builders, et al. (N.D. Ohio). At issue was whether, under the Fair Housing Act’s accessibility requirements for newly-constructed multifamily dwellings, the front door and walkway leading to a covered unit are required to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Defendants argued that their only obligation was to provide an accessible route into the unit, which, they alleged, they had done by providing an accessible route through the garage. The United States filed a Statement of Interest arguing that, under the Act, the front doors and walkways are “public use and common use portions” of covered dwellings and therefore required to be accessible, regardless whether there is another accessible route into the unit. The court agreed, finding that the failure to provide “unimpeded access” to the front door to persons who use wheelchairs, including not just those who live in the unit but also a “neighbor, friend, or family member, a political candidate, or a repairman,” is “in effect, to send them away as if unwelcome,” and “precisely the discrimination the FHAA forbids.”\n\nAlbanian Associated Fund, Inc. v. Township of Wayne (D. N.J.)\n\nOn July 20, 2007, the court granted the United States' motion for leave to file an amicus brief in Albanian Associated Fund, Inc. v. Township of Wayne (D. N.J.), a Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) case brought by plaintiffs who are seeking to construct a mosque in the Township. The Township commenced eminent domain proceedings against the Albanian Association Fund's land while its application for a conditional use permit to construct a mosque on that land was pending before the Township's Planning Board. The Township argued on summary judgment that eminent domain proceedings are not covered by RLUIPA. The Division's brief argues that the Townships' commencement of eminent domain proceedings in this case constitutes the implementation of a land use regulation covered by RLUIPA.\n\nAlexander v. Riga (3rd Cir.)\n\nA federal court jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania found that the defendants had discriminated against an African American couple by lying about the availability of a rental unit. However, the jury declined to award the couple any compensatory damages, even a nominal amount. The judge then refused to let the jury consider whether to grant punitive damages. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and on June 3, 1999, the Civil Rights Division filed an amicus brief arguing that the judge should have allowed the jury to decide whether to award punitive damages. On March 22, 2000, the appellate court reversed the district courts' judgment for the defendants by holding that \"in a case alleging discrimination under the Fair Housing Act the discrimination itself is the harm,\" and directed the district court to enter judgment for the plaintiffs and to hold a new jury trial on whether the plaintiffs should be awarded punitive damages. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on January 8, 2001.\n\nAmerican Insurance Association v. HUD (D.D.C.)\n\nThe plaintiffs, homeowners insurance trade associations, filed a lawsuit on June 26, 2013, alleging HUD violated the Administrative Procedure Act in its February 2013 regulation formalizing that the Fair Housing Act provides for disparate impact liability. On November 7, 2014, the district court denied HUD's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On September 23, 2015, the Court of Appeals vacated the district court's decision and remanded for consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Texas Department of Housing & Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. On remand, the plaintiffs alleged that HUD violated the APA because the regulation impermissibly interprets the FHA to provide for disparate impact claims against insurance underwriting and pricing practices that exceed the contours of disparate impact claims permitted by Inclusive Communities. HUD's opening brief, filed August 30, 2016, and its reply brief, filed October 28, 2016, argued that the plaintiffs misread Inclusive Communities and misconstrue the Rule's requirements.\n\nArnal v. Aspen View Condo. Ass'n, et al. (D. Colo.)\n\nOn December 27, 2016, the court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment in Arnal v. Aspen View Condo. Ass’n (D. Colo.), a lawsuit alleging discrimination on the basis of disability and retaliation under the Fair Housing Act. The plaintiff, the owner of a condominium unit, alleges that his condominium association improperly denied a reasonable accommodation to its “no dogs” policy to allow his tenant to keep a service dog that assisted her with her epilepsy, and that the condo association retaliated against him for allowing the tenant to keep the dog by issuing fines. On July 7, 2016, the United States had filed a statement of interest, arguing that a plaintiff may maintain a retaliation claim even in the absence of an underlying discrimination claim and that evidence that defendants imposed fines on a unit owner for allowing a tenant the requested accommodation supported a prima facie case of retaliation under the Fair Housing Act. The court ruled, consistent with the statement of interest, that plaintiff’s retaliation claim was not dependent upon his reasonable accommodation claim and that a reasonable jury could conclude that the fines were imposed in retaliation for allowing his tenant to live in the condo unit with her dog and assisting his tenant in exercising her fair housing rights.\n\nAvalon Residential Care, Homes, Inc. v. City of Dallas (N.D. Tex.)\n\nOn November 9, 2000, the United States filed an amicus brief that opposed the legal arguments made by the City of Dallas in its motion for summary judgment. The United States argued that the City violated the Fair Housing Act by improperly denying a reasonable accommodation when it refused to grant the plaintiff a variance to the City's 1000 foot spacing requirement and six person occupancy limit for group homes serving persons with disabilities.\n\nBaltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. v. Rommel Builders, Inc. (D. Md.)\n\nThe United States filed two amicus briefs in this case, brought by private plaintiffs. They had claimed that a condominium complex in Anne Arundel County, Maryland violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to be designed and constructed so that it is accessible and usable by persons with disabilities. In the United States' first brief, the Division set forth the standard for determining whether the defendants had violated the accessibility provisions of the Act. In the second brief, which was filed on December 20, 1999, the Division presented the court with our views as to what equitable remedies are appropriate in a case in which the defendants have been found liable for violating the accessibility provisions of the Fair Housing Act. On April 21, 2000, the court granted the plaintiffs' request for both monetary damages and equitable relief. In its opinion, the court found that \"affirmative action relief in the form of retrofitting or a retrofitting fund is an appropriate remedy in this case.\" Accordingly, the court ordered the establishment of a fund of approximately $333,000 to pay for the cost of retrofitting the common areas of the condominium and, with the consent of individual owners, interiors of inaccessible units. Individuals seeking to retrofit their units will be entitled to receive an incentive payment of $3,000 to do so. Although the condominium association was not found liable for the violations, the court ordered it to permit the retrofitting of the common areas. The court will also appoint a special master to oversee the retrofitting project, and retains jurisdiction until all funds have been expended or distributed. If any funds remain unspent, the court noted that \"the equitable principles and the purposes\" of the Fair Housing will guide the distribution of those funds.\n\nBank of America Corporation\n\nOn May 26, 2011, the United States executed a Memorandum of Agreement with Bank of America Corporation resolving the United States' claims that the Bank violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by failing to lower the interest rate on servicemembers' credit card loans to 6%, or to maintain the reduced interest rate through the entire period of military service, after those servicemembers sent in military orders and requested a reduction in the interest rate between October 2003 and December 2007. Under the agreement, the Bank will provide $86,023 to compensate nine servicemembers whom the Division claimed were victims of the Bank's conduct. The Bank will also make changes to its policies and procedures to ensure that it does not impose fees or interest rates in excess of 6% on servicemembers' credit card loan obligations that originated prior to the period of military service, such as training employees, verifying active duty information with the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center database before raising a servicemember's credit card interest rate above 6%, and designating a telephone number at which servicemembers with questions about SCRA benefits may reach Bank of America representatives.\n\nBloch v. Frischholz (7th Cir.)\n\nOn November 13, 2009, the en banc Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Bloch v. Frischholz (7th Cir.) ordered the partial reinstatement of a Jewish family's FHA suit against a condominium board that repeatedly removed a mezuzah, a small religious object required by the familys' faith, from their door frame. The original panel affirmed the trial court's finding for the defendants in holding that the FHA does not reach post-acquisition discrimination per Halprin v. Prairie Single Family Homes and that the condo association did not discriminate because it acted under a neutral, though previously unenforced, policy of barring hallway clutter. On January 16, 2009, at the request of the en banc Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the United States filed an amicus brief arguing that the court should reinstate a Jewish familys' FHA suit against a condominium board that barred them from placing a mezuzah on their door frame. In its brief, the United States argues that the trial court and the panel majority erred in holding that the FHA did not apply to post-acquisition discrimination and that the family presented evidence suggesting that the condominium board changed the enforcement of its rules to bar the familys' mezuzah based on anti-Jewish animus. The en banc decision \"effectively overrules Halprin as far as § 3617 is concerned\" and holds that the \"contractual connection between the Blochs and the [Condo] Board distinguishes this case from Halprin\" for purposes of § 3604(b). As a result, the court found the plaintiffs 'claims of post-acquisition discrimination viable under both FHA provisions and ordered the trial court to determine whether defendants acted with discriminatory intent on remand. As for Section 3604(a), the unanimous court agreed with Halprin in holding that post-acquisition discrimination claims under this provision extend to actual and constructive evictions (and little else) but dismissed this count after finding that the plaintiffs failed to explain their decision to remain on the premises.\n\nCalvillo, et al. v. Baywood Equities, L.P., et al.\n\nOn May 16, 2019, the United States entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the HUD election referral, Calvillo, et al. v. Baywood Equities, L.P., et al. The parties to the agreement are the United States, complainants (a family residing at Baywood Apartments in Petaluma, California), and respondents (the owners and managers of Baywood Apartments). The settlement agreement resolves allegations that the respondents discriminated against the complainants on the basis of disability when they denied the complainants’ request for a reasonable accommodation for an emotional support animal. The complainants further alleged that the respondents made intimidating statements and interfered with their right to request a reasonable accommodation. The settlement agreement requires respondents to pay $32,500 to the complainants. The agreement also includes the implementation of a reasonable accommodation policy, training, and reporting requirements.\n\nCason v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (M.D. Tenn.)\n\nOn July 11, 2000, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiffs in Cason v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (M.D. Tenn.). In this case, plaintiffs allege that defendants' practice of permitting Nissan dealers to set finance charges at their discretion resulted in African-Americans paying higher finance charges, and that these higher charges could not be explained by non-discriminatory factors. In our amicus brief in support of plaintiffs 'opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment, we argue that a lender has a non-delegable duty to comply with ECOA, and, thus, is liable under ECOA for discriminatory pricing in loans that it approves and funds. The United States further argue that plaintiffs do not need to prove that defendant was on notice regarding the alleged discrimination, but that, in any case, plaintiffs have offered evidence that defendant was on notice. The court subsequently denied summary judgment for the defendants, and the case is currently on appeal regarding class certification.\n\nChristian Fellowship Centers of NY, Inc. v. Village of Canton, NY (N.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn March 26, 2019, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Christian Fellowship Centers of New York, Inc. v. Village of Canton, NY (N.D.N.Y.), a case brought under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The case involves Christian Fellowship Centers of New York, Inc. (“CFC”), a religious organization that purchased property in the Village of Canton’s (“Village”) downtown C-1 Commercial District to assemble for worship and conduct other religious activities. In its filed Complaint, CFC alleges that the Village barred it from operating in the C-1 district, even though the Village’s zoning law permits other similarly situated secular assembly uses to operate in the district, including municipal buildings, charitable and social clubs, and theaters. CFC filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to find that the Village’s zoning law facially violates RLUIPA’s equal terms provision, which the Village opposed, arguing that it had legitimate zoning goals, such as promoting commercial enterprise in the C-1 district and the impact of New York’s law limiting the distance between churches and liquor-serving establishments, to bar CFC from operating in the C-1 district. The Division argued in the Statement of Interest that CFC is likely to prevail on the merits of its RLUIPA equal term claim, and that the Village’s justifications for barring churches from the C-1 district are not valid bases under RLUIPA to treat churches less favorably than similarly situated secular assemblies. On March 29, 2019, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York issued an opinion granting CFC’s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoining the Village from enforcing the ordinance to prevent CFC from using the property as a church until further proceedings are held. The Court reasoned that CFC has a likelihood of success to prevail on the merits of its RLUIPA equal terms claim because the ordinance treats religious assemblies less well than secular assemblies and the interests articulated by the Village are not compelling to justify unequal treatment.\n\nCongregation Etz Chaim v. City of Los Angeles (C.D. Cal.)\n\nOn April 28, 2011, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Congregation Etz Chaim v. City of Los Angeles (C.D. Cal.), in support of the Congregation's motion for summary judgment in this Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) suit. The statement of interest addresses the standard the court should apply in evaluating the Congregation's RLUIPA Section 2(b)(1) claim, and discusses certain criteria for determining whether a substantial burden exists under RLUIPA Section 2(a). On January 6, 2011, the court issued an order holding that the City's administrative zoning decisions did not preclude the congregation's RLUIPA claims in federal court. The United States had filed a statement of interest on November 1, 2010. In the order, the court quoted the United States' Statement of Interest extensively.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau & United States v. Hudson City Savings Bank, F.S.B. (D. N.J.)\n\nOn September 24, 2015, the United States filed a complaint and consent order in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and United States v. Hudson City Savings Bank, F.S.B. (D. N.J.), a Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act pattern or practice case. The joint complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) alleges that from at least 2009 to 2013, Hudson City Savings Bank (Hudson City) failed to provide its home mortgage lending services to majority-Black-and-Hispanic neighborhoods on an equal basis as it provided those services to predominantly white neighborhoods, a practice commonly known as \"redlining,\" throughout its major market areas in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Under the consent order Hudson City will provide $25 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase the amount of credit the bank extends to formerly redlined neighborhoods across its market areas; invest $2.25 million for advertising, outreach, financial education, and community partnership and open two full-service branches in these neighborhoods; increase the number of loan officers dedicated to majority-Black-and-Hispanic neighborhoods; develop and implement a compliance management system and training curriculum to ensure compliance with fair lending obligations; and create a comprehensive long-term plan to increase lending in previously redlined areas. Hudson City will further pay a civil monetary penalty of $5.5 million, pursuant to the CFPB's civil penalty authority under ECOA. The court entered the consent order on November 4, 2015.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau & United States v. National City Bank (W.D. Pa.)\n\nOn January 9, 2014, the court entered a consent order in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau & United States v. National City Bank (W.D. Pa.), an Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act case that resulted from a joint investigation by the Division and the CFPB. PNC Bank is the successor in interest to National City Bank. The complaint, which was filed on December 23, 2013, alleged a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in residential mortgage lending. The consent order requires PNC Bank to pay $35 million to African-American and Hispanic victims of National City Bank's discriminatory conduct.\n\nDefiore v. City Rescue Mission of New Castle (W.D. Pa.)\n\nOn July 19, 2013, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania filed a statement of interest in Defiore v. City Rescue Mission of New Castle (W.D. Pa.), arguing against the pending motion to dismiss. The brief argued that: (1) the homeless shelter is a \"dwelling\" under the Fair Housing Act; (2) Sections 3604(f)(1) and (f)(2) of the FHA are not limited to traditional sales and leases; (3) the FHA's religious exemption does not apply to disability discrimination; (4) defendants cannot prove at the pleading stage that the shelter meets the FHA's or ADA's standard for a religious exemption; (5) Mr. DeFiore did not need to present himself in person to prove that he was blind and needed a guide dog; and (6) defendants cannot show undue burden on the pleadings. On December 12, 2013, the court found that, in light of a report showing cognitive deficiencies in Mr. DeFiore that may impede his ability to assist in this case, the issue of his competence must be explored further. The court entered a consent order on August 20, 2014.\n\nDominos' Pizza LLC (N.C.)\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the United States reached with settlement agreement Dominos' Pizza, Inc. under which Dominos' adopted a Limited Delivery Services Policy. The United States had received a complaint that Dominos' policy of providing only limited pizza delivery in certain geographical areas had a discriminatory effect on African Americans in the more than 650 corporate stores and 3,900 franchise stores throughout the country. The policy provides guidelines by which store managers can limit delivery in certain geographical areas. Under the policy, Dominos stores may limit delivery services in specific areas where there is evidence that' the safety of delivery drivers is threatened by current criminal activity in the area. The policy recommends that Dominos' stores consult with local law enforcement, as well as businesses and community organizations, to determine the gravity of safety concerns and the need to limit delivery services. The scope of any delivery limitations by Dominos stores must be narrowly confined to the area in which safety is a concern. Store managers also must conduct an annual review of any decision to limit delivery to determine if the threat to safety is still present or if the delivery limitation may be lifted. Dominos' Director of Safety and Security will review decisions by corporate stores to limit delivery.\n\nDrayton v. McIntosh County (S.D. Ga.)\n\nOn April 21, 2016, the United States filed a Statement of Interest together with FCS in Drayton v. McIntosh County (S.D. Ga.), a lawsuit alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin under a number of statutes, including the Fair Housing Act and Title VI. The complaint alleges that several defendants, including McIntosh County and the State of Georgia, discriminated against the Gullah Geechee population on Sapelo Island, through, among other things, the unequal provision of municipal services, unequal application of zoning and land use ordinances, and unfair property tax appraisals. The Statement of Interest, filed in connection with Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, make arguments including that post-acquisition claims are cognizable under the FHA. The Appellate Section also intervened in the matter to address constitutional issues related to the ADA.\n\nEstes. v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission (Chancery Court for Rutherford County, Tennessee)\n\nOn October 18, 2010, the United States' filed an amicus brief in Estes v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission (Chancery Court for Rutherford County, Tennessee). The amicus brief argues that Islam is plainly a religion, that a mosque is plainly a place of worship, and that county acted appropriately under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) in treating the application as it would any other application from a religious institution. The division's brief argues that Islam is a religion entitled to protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and points out that, \"consistent among all three branches of government, the United States has recognized Islam as a major world religion.\" This is an action brought by county residents in state court objecting to the county's approval of a mosque construction project in Murfreesboro. The residents contend, among other things, that the county erred in treating the mosque as a religious institution without inquiring into whether Islam is an ideology rather than a religion, and without inquiring into whether terrorist and other illegal activities would be undertaken at the site. Rutherford County, Tenn., is the defendant in the civil case, and had granted permission for the construction of the mosque. The county is opposing the landowners' attempt to stop construction.\n\nEqual Rights Center v. AvalonBay Communities (D. Md.)\n\nOn July 1, 2008, the court accepted for filing the United States' amicus brief in Equal Rights Center v. AvalonBay Communities (D. Md.), a Fair Housing Act pattern or practice design and construction case. The defendant has moved to dismiss part of ERC's complaint, arguing that relief for properties completed more than two years before the complaint was filed is barred by the statute of limitations. The Division argues that the statute of limitations does not bar ERC from seeking relief for these properties. On March 23, 2009 the court denied AvalonBay's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment based on its Memorandum Opinion.\n\nEqual Rights Center v. Equity Residential (D. Md.)\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the court entered an opinion and order on the parties' partial summary judgment motions in Equal Rights Center v. Equity Residential (D. Md.), an FHA design and construction case involving multiple properties in numerous states. On November 13, 2014, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the Equal Rights Center's summary judgment motion. The brief argues that 1) violations of the HUD Fair Housing Amendments Act Guidelines establish a prima facie case that the Act's design and construction provisions have been violated, which may be overcome only by showing compliance with a comparable, objective accessibility standard; and 2) the failure to design and construct accessible multifamily housing is a discrete violation of the Fair Housing Act and does not require that an individual be denied housing based on disability. The court's opinion adopted the United States' argument that the plaintiff in a design-and-construction case may demonstrate liability by showing that the defendant did not follow the HUD FHA Guidelines, and that the defendant may overcome this showing only by demonstrating compliance with another, comparable accessibility standard. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that a more subjective standard for accessibility should control. Finally, the court agreed that demonstrating violations of the FHA's accessibility requirements did not require a showing that an actual buyer or renter was denied housing.\n\nEqual Rights Center v. Post Properties (D.D.C.)\n\nOn February 20, 2009, the United States filed a motion for leave to file an amicus brief opposing defendants' summary judgment motion in Equal Rights Center v. Post Properties (D.D.C.), a Fair Housing Act design and construction case alleging discrimination on the basis of disability. The brief argues that 1) violations of the HUD Fair Housing Amendments Act Guidelines establish a prima facie case that the Act's design and construction provisions have been violated, which may be overcome only by showing compliance with a comparable, objective accessibility standard; 2) contrary to Garcia v. Brockway, 526 F.3d 456 (9th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., Thompson v. Turk, __ U.S. __, 129 S. Ct. 724 (2008), the statute of limitations in design and construction cases begins to run when the plaintiff encounters and is injured by the accessibility violations; 3) the continuing violations doctrine allows plaintiff to recover for properties completed before the limitations period; and 4)to defendants' brief misstates the law on organizational.\n\nFair Housing of the Dakotas v. Goldmark Property Management Co. (D. N.D.)\n\nOn November 2, 2010, the United States filed an amicus brief in Fair Housing of the Dakotas v. Goldmark Property Management Co. No. 09-cv-58 (D. N.D.), a putative class action challenge brought under the Fair Housing Act to a rental management company's animal assistance policies. The United States' brief was filed in support of plaintiffs' opposition to defendant's summary judgment motion and argued that: (1) the FHA bars landlords from requiring that assistance animals have special training in order to be accepted as a reasonable accommodation. Emotional support or companion animals, which do not have special training, may be required accommodations under the FHA; (2) the FHA may require landlords to waive generally applicable pet fees for assistance animals if necessary to ensure a disabled tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a residence; and that (3) fees that are applied to non-specially trained assistance animal for persons with mental disabilities but waived for \"service animals\" for persons with physical disabilities, are not generally applicable and discriminate on the basis of disability.\n\nSettlement Agreement between United States and F & K Management, Inc., d/b/a Hard Times Cafes and Santa Fe Cue Clubs (Springfield and Herndon, Virginia)\n\nOn February 28, 2003, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with F & K Management, Inc., d/b/a Hard Times Cafes and Santa Fe Cue Clubs, to resolve a complaint brought to the attention of the Division's National Origin Working Group (NOWG) by the Sikh Coalition, a national Sikh advocacy group. The Coalition reported that on September 23, 2001, a young Indian-American Sikh was told by a manager to remove his turban or leave at its Springfield, Virginia club. The Division's investigation revealed that F & K had promulgated and posted a policy in its clubs prohibiting head coverings with the exception of cowboy hats and baseball caps. Pursuant to the agreement, F & K rescinded its head covering policy and replaced it with a dress code approved by the United States, posted nondiscrimination signs at the five (5) establishments it owns and/or operates, agreed to place periodic nondiscrimination ads in the Washington Post and local and national Sikh and Muslim publications over a 3-year period, and arranged for periodic training of its owners and employees by Sikh and Islamic organizations over the three-year term of the agreement. In addition, F & K's owner wrote a formal letter of apology to the complainant and provided free dinner and pool playing privileges for use by him, his family and friends.\n\nFirst Boston Real Estate (Okla.)\n\nOn June 28, 2000, the United States signed a settlement agreement with a real estate company settling our allegations that one of its former agents violated the Fair Housing Act on the basis of race by engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination in the sale of a dwelling. The settlement agreement obligates the real estate company, First Boston Real Estate, to implement a non-discriminatory policy, which will be displayed in its offices and distributed to any persons who inquire about the availability of any properties, as well as to all agents. There are reporting requirements and the Metropolitan Fair Housing Council of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma will receive $3,000.00 in compensatory damages.\n\nFortune Society, Inc. v. Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp. (E.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn October 18, 2016, the United States filed a statement of interest in Fortune Society, Inc. v. Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp. (E.D.N.Y.). The case was brought by an organization that helps formerly incarcerated individuals find housing challenging the practices of an affordable rental apartment complex with 917 units in Far Rockaway, Queens. The statement of interest aims to assist the court in evaluating whether a housing provider’s policy that considers criminal records in an application process produces unlawful discriminatory effects in violation of the FHA. Although the FHA does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants’ criminal records, the brief explains that “categorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.” The brief also explains that when a housing provider has a criminal record check policy with a disparate impact, the housing provider must “prove with evidence – and not just by invoking generalized concerns about safety – that the ban is necessary.” Even then, the policy will still violate the FHA if there is a less discriminatory alternative.\n\nGarden State Islamic Center v. City of Vineland, NJ (D. N.J.)\n\nOn September 5, 2017, the United States and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey filed a statement of interest in Garden State Islamic Center v. City of Vineland, NJ (D. N.J.), a RLUIPA action brought by GSIC challenging the city’s refusal to grant a certificate of occupancy for a place of worship on the basis that GSIC did not satisfy sewage regulation requirements. The United States does not take a position on whether the city has violated RLUIPA, but only weighs in against the city’s assertion that GSIC’s complaint should be dismissed on the ground that the sewage regulation does not constitute a “land use regulation” and therefore is not covered by RLUIPA. The United States contends that the application of the sewage regulation is covered by RLUIPA. On December 12, 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued an opinion denying a city’s motion to dismiss GSIC’s RLUIPA action, finding that the city’s denial of a certificate of occupancy for GSIC’s place of worship based on the application of State sewage regulations fell within RLUIPA, and that the sewage regulations were a “land use regulation” under RLUIPA. The court found that the city incorporated the sewage regulations by reference in its zoning code, and that the record showed that the sewage approval process was used as a means to thwart the GSIC’s project.\n\nGomez v. Quicken Loans (C.D. Cal.)\n\nOn April 1, 2013, the Division filed a statement of interest in Gomez v. Quicken Loans (C.D. Cal.), a case alleging that Quicken Loans discriminated against borrowers with disabilities by requiring that they provide a letter from a doctor as a condition of their loans. The statement of interest states that (1) Smith v. City of Jackson did not overrule, explicitly or implicitly, decades of Fair Housing Act disparate impact precedent, (2) disparate treatment claims do not require proof of ill intent, and (3) Equal Credit Opportunity Act claims do not require a denial of credit. The court dismissed the complaint and Mr. Gomez filed an appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Division filed an amicus brief in the Court of Appeals on January 16, 2014. The Ninth Circuit ruled on November 2, 2015, holding that plaintiff pled a disparate treatment claim by alleging that \"disabled individuals like Gomez were subject to the presumption that their SSDI award letters were insufficient evidence of income and [were] asked to meet a higher standard of proof [of income] than other applicants.\" The case was remanded to the District Court.\n\nGordon v. Pete's Auto Service of Denbigh, Inc. (4th Cir.)\n\nOn February 14, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion holding that the SCRA amendments providing an express private right of action for damages should apply to this case. On October 27, 2010, the Division participated in oral argument as amicus in Gordon v. Pete's Auto Service of Denbigh, Inc. (4th Cir.), supporting the servicemember's argument that there is a private right of action to enforce the provision of the SCRA that requires lienholders to get a court order before enforcing a lien on a servicemember's property. The court ordered supplemental briefing on whether amendments made to the SCRA on October 13, 2010, adding an explicit private right of action, are retroactive. On November 29, 2010, the Division filed a supplemental amicus arguing that the amendment providing an express private right of action for damages should apply retroactively in this case.\n\nGroome and United States v. Jefferson Parrish (E.D. La.)\n\nIn June 1999, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana held that Jefferson Parish violated the Fair Housing Act when it refused to permit the operation of a group residence for five adults with Alzheimer's Disease. The Parish zoning ordinance required the group home provider to seek an accommodation to house five persons instead of the permitted four. The court held that the Parish broke the law when it failed to act on the request because of opposition from neighborhood residents and a member of the Parish Board. The Parish appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing that the Fair Housing Act protections for persons with disabilities are unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Division intervened and filed a brief arguing that Congress had power to pass the legislation under both the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The United States also filed an amicus brief in the district court. On November 20, 2000, a unanimous three-judge panel joined three other Courts of Appeal holding that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate the housing market.\n\nHamad v. Woodcrest Condominiums Association (E.D. Mich.)\n\nOn November 5, 2003, the United States filed an amicus brief in Hamad v. Woodcrest Condominiums Association (E.D. Mich.), a private Fair Housing Act case alleging familial status discrimination. In its brief, the United States argues that defendants' former policy of restricting families with children to first floor units violates the Act as a matter of law. The United States had also filed an amicus brief in January 2001, taking the same position. In February, 2002, the United States had entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants rescission of association bylaws restricting families with children to first floor units in the three story complex. The agreement also provides for rescission of condominium rules restricting the conduct of children in the common areas, fair housing training of association board members and employees and notification to the public of the association's change in policies. The plaintiffs in the action were a young couple steered to a first floor unit because they planned to have children and a single woman in the process of obtaining custody of her minor nephew who was denied permission to live with her nephew in her third floor unit.\n\nHand in Hand/Mano en Mano v. Town of Milbridge, Maine (D. Me.)\n\nOn March 16, 2010, the case settled before the court ruled on the issue raised in the United States amicus brief. On November 17, 2009, the court granted the United States' motion for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in Hand in Hand/Mano en Mano v. Town of Milbridge, Maine C.A. No. 1:09cv287 (D. Me.). In this case, defendant Town of Milbridge adopted a moratorium that halted development of plaintiff's proposed housing project of farmworkers and their families. The plaintiff alleges that the moratorium was adopted because of resident opposition based on the national origin and familial status of the prospective residents. Our amicus brief was submitted in connection with plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. We did not take a position on the merits, but set out our view as to the applicable legal principles.\n\nHargraves v. Capitol City Mortgage Corp. (D.D.C.)\n\nIn this lawsuit against Capital City Mortgage Corp. and its president and Thomas Nash, private plaintiffs contend that the company targeted minorities for loans that were designed to fail, due to unfair payment terms and income levels of the borrowers that would not sustain the loan payments. In their complaint, the plaintiffs claim that Capital City's lending practices violated several federal laws, including the Fair Housing and the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts by engaging in a pattern or practice of targeting African American communities, a practice known as \"reverse redlining,\" for abusive or predatory lending practices. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that reverse redlining does not violate either law because they have provided credit to African Americans, and on the same terms that they would provide to whites. On March 23, 2000, the United States filed an amicus brief, which supported the view that lending practices designed to induce minorities into loans destined to fail could violate the fair lending laws. The brief argues that by targeting minorities for predatory loans, a lender discriminates in the terms and conditions of home financing, even if it makes all or most of its loans in minority areas. The fact that a lender does business only in minority neighborhoods does not shield its business from scrutiny under federal fair lending laws. In addition, racially targeted loans that are designed to fail make housing unavailable because of race since the borrowers are likely to lose their homes through foreclosure. The matter was settled and dismissed on March 27, 2002. The Federal Trade Commission has filed a separate action charging the same defendants with violating a number of federal consumer protection laws. FTC v. Capital City Mortgage Corp., No. 98-237 (JHG/AK) (D.D.C. filed Jan. 29, 1998). The matter was settled on March 14, 2005.\n\nHomecomings Financial, LLC\n\nOn December 12, 2008, Homecomings Financial, LLC and GMAC Mortgage, LLC and their affiliates, including but not limited to GMAC Bank and Residential Funding Company, LLC, agreed to resolve our Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) investigation. This matter arose when United States Air Force Master Sergeant Brenda S. Gomez received permanent change of station orders transferring her from Tinker Air Force Base to Vance Air Force Base. When she sold her home to move closer to the new base, Homecomings denied MSgt Gomez's request to waive the prepayment penalty on her residential mortgage loan. As a result of the Justice Department's investigation, Homecomings has refunded MSgt Gomez's $9,144 prepayment penalty and has agreed to waive the prepayment penalties of servicemembers in the future who are transferred involuntarily to a base thirty miles or more from their current residence.\n\nHope Lutheran Church v. City of St. Ignace (W.D. Mich.)\n\nOn March 19, 2019, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Hope Lutheran Church v. City of St. Ignace, MI (W.D. Mich.), a case brought under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The case involves Hope Lutheran Church (Hope), a religious organization that purchased property in St. Ignace’s (City) downtown General Business District (GBD) to assemble for worship and hold Bible studies. In its filed complaint, Hope alleges that the City barred it from operating in the GBD, even though the City permits other similarly situated secular assembly uses to operate in the district, including municipal buildings, assembly halls, and theaters. Hope filed a motion for preliminary/permanent injunction asking the court to find that the City has violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), which the City opposed, arguing that it had legitimate zoning criterion, such as tax generation and the impact of Michigan’s law limiting the distance between churches and liquor-serving establishments, to bar Hope from operating in the GBD. The City also filed a motion to dismiss Hope’s complaint, arguing that the church fails to allege facts sufficient to state a violation of RLUIPA. The Division argued in the statement of interest that Hope’s allegations state a claim under RLUIPA’s equal terms provision, and that the City’s justifications for barring churches from the GBD, such as tax generation and the impact of Michigan’s law limiting the distance between churches and liquor-serving establishments, are not valid bases under RLUIPA to treat churches less favorably than similarly situated secular assemblies. On May 22, 2019, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued an opinion denying the City’s motion to dismiss, holding that Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to state an equal terms claim under RLUIPA. The Court reasoned that revenue maximization and concerns regarding liquor licensing are not compelling to justify unequal treatment because there is nothing in the City’s ordinances that discusses revenue maximization or concerns over liquor licensing in the GBD.\n\nJagannath Organization for Global Awareness, Inc. v. Howard County, Maryland (D. Md.)\n\nOn July 23, 2018, the United States filed a statement of interest in Jagannath Organization for Global Awareness, Inc. v. Howard County, Maryland (D. Md.). The plaintiff, Jagannath Organization for Global Awareness (“JOGA”), filed an amended complaint alleging that Howard County violated RLUIPA’s substantial burden, equal terms, and nondiscrimination provisions by failing to approve a land use application for JOGA to construct a temple within the County. The County has moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In the statement of interest, the United States argues that JOGA has sufficiently alleged a substantial burden claim. Specifically, the United States points out that no Jagannath temple exists in Howard County or Maryland, and argues that JOGA’s proposed temple is a permitted use and can satisfy each of the County’s land use requirements, that the County’s denial was unconditional, and that the County’s decision departs from previous cases in which it has approved secular and non-secular uses with characteristics similar to JOGA’s proposed use.\n\nJ & R Associates (D. Mass.)\n\nOn July 6, 2017, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with J & R Associates, the owner and operator of the Royal Park Apartments, a 224-unit multi-family housing complex in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The settlement resolves allegations that J & R Associates discriminated against tenants of South Asian descent in violation of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race and national origin. Under the terms of the agreement, J & R Associates will establish a $70,000 settlement fund to compensate victims of the discriminatory practices. J & R Associates also has agreed to train any new employees and to comply with the Fair Housing Act going forward. In a related matter resolved in 2015, J & R Associates agreed to make changes to its rental practices to resolve allegations that it had been steering families with children to certain buildings and units in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nJubilee Apartments\n\nOn November 29, 2001, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with Jubilee Apartments, Inc.; Falcon Development Company; and J. Lamont Langworthy (respondents) to settle alleged violations of Section 804(f)(3)(C) of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) with respect to the design and construction of the apartments at Palermo Apartments, formerly known as Jubilee Apartments. The case was referred to the United States by HUD on January 27, 2000. The settlement requires the respondents to retrofit the public use and common areas, post a nondiscrimination policy, provide staff training on the Fair Housing Act and submit periodic reports to the United States.\n\nLouisiana ACORN Fair Housing v. LeBlanc (5th Cir.)\n\nIn consolidated cases brought by the United States and Louisiana ACORN Fair Housing and Gene Lewis, plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, the owner and operator of an apartment complex in Lake Charles, Louisiana, intentionally discriminated on the basis of race against Gene Lewis when he refused to rent him a studio apartment. On September 15, 1998, the jury found liability against Danny LeBlanc and awarded Gene Lewis no compensatory damages, but $10,000 in punitive damages. LeBlanc appealed the judgment, arguing that Lewis' punitive damages award should be vacated because the jury awarded him neither compensatory nor nominal damage. On June 10, 1999, the Division filed an amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit arguing that the Fair Housing Act permits an award of punitive damages in the absence of compensatory or nominal damages, and that the district court had properly entered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict awarding punitive damages to Gene Lewis. On May 15, 2000, the Fifth Circuit reversed and vacated the jury's punitive damages award to Gene Lewis, holding that a plaintiff suing under the Fair Housing Act may not receive punitive damages absent an award of compensatory or nominal damages. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on March 5, 2001.\n\nMagner v. Gallagher (No. 10-1032)\n\nOn December 29, 2011, the United States filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in Magner v. Gallagher (No. 10-1032), an appeal from a decision of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The United States filed as amicus in support of neither party. In its amicus brief, the United States argued that disparate impact claims are cognizable under Section 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act. First, the United States argued that the text and history of Section 804(a) support the recognition of disparate impact claims. The United States further argued that, even if the text of the statute were ambiguous, HUD, the agency charged with interpreting the Act, has consistently expressed a view that the FHA provides for disparate impact claims by means entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, including in formal adjudications, joint guidance with other agencies, and appellate briefs. The brief also notes that, on November 16, 2011, HUD issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, reiterating the agency's consistent view that the FHA encompasses disparate impact liability and establishing standards for resolving disparate impact claims. Finally, the United States argued that while the 8th Circuit correctly invoked a three-step burden shifting framework for analyzing disparate impact claims under the FHA, its application of that framework to the respondents' claims was flawed, as the court failed to identify sufficient evidence that the City's enforcement measures caused a disparate impact on African-Americans or that there existed a less discriminatory alternative that could equally achieve the City's legitimate objectives.\n\nHunter v. The District of Columbia (D.D.C.)\n\nThis case is an action by a family, including a minor daughter with severe mobility impairments, who reside in the D.C. homeless shelter system. They allege among other things that the District, and the contractor which runs its shelters, failed to respond adequately to requests for accommodations to address her disabilities, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and DC statutory provisions. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The Housing Section and the Disability Rights Section filed a statement of interest on July 26, 2013 opposing the motions. On August 18, 2014, the court issued a favorable decision, denying the motion to dismiss the ADA and Sec. 504 claims in its entirety, holding among other things that the district is liable for discrimination by its contractor. With respect to the FHA, the court concludes that shelters are covered \"dwellings\" under the FHA. The court also concludes that even though section 804(f)(1) of the FHA, which prohibits refusal to make a dwelling available, does not apply to protect the plaintiffs because they are not \"buyers or renters,\" section 804(f)(2), which forbids discrimination in the \"terms or conditions of a rental,\" does protect plaintiffs even though they do not pay directly for their shelter. Other claims are dismissed in part and sustained in part.\n\nLoveless v. Euramex Management Group, LLC (Wesley Apartment Homes, LLC)\n\nOn October 20, 2017, the United States entered into a settlement agreement resolving a Fair Housing Act election referral from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD charged the owner and property manager of an apartment complex in Atlanta, Georgia with discrimination on the basis of race and color because they refused to rent, or to continue to rent, to applicants or tenants who had been convicted of any felony at any time in their lives. The settlement requires the owner and property manager to adopt and implement non-discriminatory procedures for screening tenants and applicants, and to train employees who interact with tenants and applicants on the Fair Housing Act.\n\nMarriott International Settlement\n\nOn August 15, 2002, the United States entered into settlement agreement with Marriott International and the Midwest Federation of American Syrian-Lebanese Clubs to resolve allegations that the Des Moines, Iowa Marriott, which is managed by Marriott International, discriminated against the Midwest Federation on the afternoon of September 11, 2001, when it revoked its previous offer to host the 2002 annual convention of the Midwest Federation. Under the agreement, Marriott agreed to pay $100,000 to establish a scholarship fund to be administered by the Midwest Federation, to pay $15,000 to be a corporate sponsor of the Midwest Federation's 2002 annual convention, and to issue a formal written apology to the Midwest Federation for its conduct in canceling the convention. On September 5, 2001, Marriott had faxed a signed contract to the Midwest Federation for its signature agreeing to host the Midwest Federation's 2002 convention at the Des Moines Marriott from August 8 through August 10, 2002. In addition to using at least 60 sleeping rooms during the three-day convention, the contract also stated that the Midwest Federation would use the hotel's meeting rooms, restaurants and hold two dinner-dances in the hotel ballroom. On the afternoon of September 11, 2001, Marriott revoked its offer to the Midwest Federation and repeatedly refused to reconsider its decision in the week following September 11th. The Justice Department's investigation was conducted under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, and religion in places of public accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants and places of entertainment. This is the first case matter resolved by the Department's Housing and Civil Enforcement Section involving post-September 11th discrimination against Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian Americans.\n\nMemphis Center for Independent Living and the United States v. Milton and Richard Grant Co. (W.D. Tenn.)\n\nOn February 15, 2007, the court entered a consent decree resolving Memphis Center for Independent Living and United States v. Grant (W.D. Tenn.). The United States' complaint, which was filed on November 6, 2001, joined a case filed on January 25, 2001, by the Memphis Center for Independent Living (\"MCIL\"), a disability rights organization, alleging that the defendants failed to design and construct the Wyndham Apartments in Memphis and Camden Grove Apartments in Cordova, Tennessee, with required features for people with disabilities. The consent decree requires the Richard and Milton Grant Company, its principals and affiliated entities, and their architects and engineers, to retrofit apartments and public and common use areas at the two complexes, and to provide accessible pedestrian routes from front entrances of ground floor units to public streets and on-site amenities. The defendants must establish a Community Retrofit Fund of $320,000, administered by the MCIL, to enable qualified individuals in Shelby County, Tennessee, to modify residential dwellings to increase their accessibility to persons with disabilities. The defendants also are required to pay $10,000 in compensatory damages to the MCIL and $110,000 in civil penalties to the government, and to undergo training on the requirements of the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The consent decree will remain in effect for three years.\n\nMetropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council v. Gundacker Real Estate, Co. (E.D. Mo.)\n\nIn this case, the defendants filed a motion to exclude the testing evidence and to exclude expert testimony. The court ordered a hearing on the admissibility of testing evidence and the plaintiff's experts. In the order, the court noted that the defendant challenged \"the methodology by which [the fair housing] tests were compiled and the lack of supporting data to show that the tests may have some scientific validity.\" On March 29, 2000, the United States filed an amicus brief on the question of whether testing evidence is subject to any special review before they can be admitted into evidence. The United States argued that testing results are factual evidence, not opinion or expert testimony and, therefore, should be admitted.\n\nMouton v. Augustine (W.D. La.)\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the United States filed a statement of interest in Mouton v. Augustine (W.D. La.), a Fair Housing Act sexual harassment case against the owner and manager of an apartment complex in Abbeville, Louisiana. The plaintiff alleged that she was sexually harassed by the apartment manager from the time she first inquired about her apartment until her tenancy ended more than two years later. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss all claims relating to conduct that happened after the plaintiff rented the apartment, arguing that post-acquisition conduct is not covered by the FHA. A few days after the United States filed the statement of interest, the defendants withdrew their motion with respect to the argument that post-acquisition conduct is not covered by the FHA.\n\nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., et al. v. Township of Mount Holly (3rd Cir.)\n\nOn June 3, 2011, the United States filed an amicus brief in Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., et al. v. Township of Mount Holly (3rd Cir.). The brief stated that the court should not review petitioners' claim that the Fair Housing Act does not encompass disparate-impact liability, noting that all 11 circuits to have decided the issue have permitted such claims The Department of Housing and Urban Development, consistent with its longstanding position, has recently promulgated a regulation providing for disparate-impact liability. Because the new regulation lays out a burden-shifting analysis for deciding such claims, the court need not review any circuit split on the appropriate burdens of proof. Because this case was decided without the benefit of the new regulation and respondents had not raised their current claims below, the case was not an appropriate vehicle for resolving the questions presented in the petition for certiorari.\n\nNational Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn August 17, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a statement of interest in National Fair Housing Alliance v. Facebook (S.D.N.Y.), a Fair Housing Act case. The complaint alleges that Facebook’s classification of its users and its ad targeting tools permit landlords, developers, and housing service providers to limit the audience for their ads based on sex, religion, familial status, and national origin in violation of the FHA. Facebook moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that the Communications Decency Act immunizes it from the FHA. The Statement of Interest argues that the CDA does not prevent an FHA lawsuit against Facebook for the conduct alleged in the complaint.\n\nNational Fair Housing Alliance v. Hunt Investments, LLC (E.D. Va.)\n\nOn May 28, 2015, the United States filed a statement of interest in National Fair Housing Alliance v. Hunt Investments, LLC (E.D. Va.), in support of the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. This Fair Housing Act complaint alleged that a Virginia apartment complex was being designed and constructed with steps and other accessibility barriers. The statement of interest addressed the proper interpretation of the design and construct provisions of the Fair Housing Act and when alleged violations of those provisions should be considered ripe for judicial review.\n\nNational Fair Housing Alliance, Inc. v. Spanos (N.D. Cal.)\n\nOn September 22, 2008, the district court granted the United States' motion for leave to file an amicus brief, and issued an order denying the defendant's motion for reconsideration in National Fair Housing Alliance, Inc. v. Spanos (N.D. Cal.). In its order, the court agreed with the United States' argument that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' en banc decision in Garcia v. Brockway did not limit plaintiffs from seeking relief for allegedly inaccessible apartment complexes that were designed and constructed more than two years before the filed their complaint, but were designed and constructed pursuant to a pattern or practice by defendants that continued into the statute of limitations period. The court concluded that in Garcia the Ninth Circuit had not \"done away with the continuing violations doctrine in all design and construction cases under the Act\" and reaffirmed the application of Havens v. Coleman Realty when such a pattern or practice is pled.\n\nNelson v. HUD (9th Cir.)\n\nOn February 11, 2008, the United States filed a brief as respondent in Nelson v. HUD (9th Cir.). The brief asserted the HUD correctly interpreted its own regulations to require, upon proof of noncompliance with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, that petitioners demonstrate compliance with some other objective measure of accessibility. The brief also asserted that Montana Fair Housing has standing under the Act; The ALJ's initial decision dismissing the suit against the Nelsons is not HUD's final order, and thus, not reviewable; HUD's ruling that front entrances must be made accessible correctly interprets the Act; HUD properly held Bernard Nelson liable as a co-owner of the property and that the petitioners are not protected by their holding company from the court's jurisdiction to enforce the remedial order's retrofitting requirements. The case was closed on October 6, 2011.\n\nOpulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs (5th Circuit)\n\nOn March 14, 2012, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiffs in Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs (5th Circuit). This case involves a small church that leased space in the central business district of Holly Springs, Mississippi, but was denied a permit to renovate and occupy the space. In Holly Springs, churches must meet a number of standards that other uses need not meet, including approval of the Mayor and Board of Alderman and the approval of 60% of homeowners within a 1,300-foot radius. After the church's permit was denied, it filed a complaint under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), challenging the ordinance both facially and as applied, and sought a preliminary injunction against the city. The court denied the preliminary injunction on the grounds that the plaintiff had not showed irreparable harm. The United States' amicus brief argues that the disparate treatment of churches compared to other assemblies violates Section 2(b)(2) of RLUIPA, which provides that religious assemblies may not be treated on less than equal terms with nonreligious assemblies and institutions. The brief also argues that the church had shown that it would be irreparably harmed if the discrimination against it were allowed to continue.\n\nOnuoha v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.)\n\nOn November 16, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a statement of interest in Onuoha v. Facebook (N.D. Cal.). In the case, the plaintiffs allege that Facebook uses its data collection and advertising tools to segregate users of the platform into different groups by race and national origin. That, according to the lawsuit, allows property owners and developers to target and exclude certain users according to those characteristics from seeing housing-related advertisements, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The statement of interest argues that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and that Facebook does not have statutory immunity under the Communications Decency Act for the development of its data collection and advertising tools.\n\nPacific Mercantile Bank\n\nOn July 18, 2018, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with Pacific Mercantile Bank, resolving the United States’ claims that the bank engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the bases of race and national origin in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). The settlement provides $1 million in relief to borrowers whom the United States alleges were harmed based on discrimination in the pricing of mortgage loans.\n\nProperty Casualty Insurers Association of America v. Donovan (N.D. Ill.)\n\nOn September 3, 2014, the court partly granted HUD's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment and partly granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in Property Casualty Insurers Association of America v. Donovan (N.D. Ill.) The plaintiff, a homeowners insurance trade association, filed a comlaint on November 27, 2013, alleging HUD violated the Administrative Procedure Act in its February 2013 regulation formalizing that the Fair Housing Act provides for disparate impact liability. The plaintiff alleged HUD violated the APA because the regulation impermissibly intrudes on state insurance regulation, because the regulation's burden-shifting framework for proving a disparate impact claim is legally erroneous, and because HUD failed to adequately consider and respond to comments from the insurance industry during the rulemaking process. HUD's briefs, filed April 4, 2014 and June 20, 2014, argued that the plaintiff lacked standing, that its challenge was not ripe, and that HUD complied with the APA.\n\nPulte Home Corporation\n\nThe United States signed a modification agreement with Pulte Home Corporation (Pulte) to supplement and amend a settlement agreement previously entered into with Pulte in July 1998. The 1998 settlement agreement resolved the United States' allegations that Pulte had failed to design and construct certain developments in Florida, Illinois, and Virginia to be accessible to persons with disabilities as required by the Fair Housing Act. The modification agreement covers three additional properties in Las Vegas, Nevada, and includes provisions requiring Pulte to annually notify current owners, for a period of three years, of their option to have Pulte retrofit their units at no expense to them in order to bring them in compliance with the Act, as well as to report to the United States the names and addresses of those persons who elect to have their units retrofitted.\n\nRamapough Mountain Indians, Inc. v. Township of Mahwah (D. N.J.)\n\nOn March 18, 2019, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Ramapough Mountain Indians, Inc. v. Township of Mahwah (D. N.J.), a case brought under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). In September 2018, the Ramapough Mountain Indians, a Native American tribe, moved to file an amended complaint (“Complaint”) alleging RLUIPA claims against the Township of Mahwah, NJ (“Township”). The complaint alleges that the Ramapough sought to worship communally and erect religious structures, including a sweat lodge and prayer circle, on their land, but that the Township tried to bar the tribe's worship practices by rescinding a zoning permit that authorized religious worship, limiting the number of people permitted on the property to worship, demanding the removal of structures central to the Ramapough’s worship, issuing large fines, and initiating civil and criminal enforcement proceedings. The tribe also alleges that the Township treated it differently from other similarly situated nonreligious groups. The Township opposed the Ramapough’s motion to amend, arguing that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state claims under RLUIPA and that the RLUIPA claims were not ripe for judicial review. The United States’ Statement of Interest argues that the facts alleged by the Ramapough state substantial burden and unequal treatment claims under RLUIPA. The Statement of Interest further argues that the RLUIPA claims, which allege that the Township’s conduct has “significantly chilled Ramapough’s use of the land for religious purposes,” are ripe and can be heard by the court.\n\nReading Housing Authority\n\nOn February 6, 2009 the United States entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with Reading Housing Authority (\"RHA\") to resolve a HUD election referral, Section 504 referral and Title VI referral. Under the agreement, RHA will set aside 5% of its annual capital funding to create, through new construction or renovation, at least 5 two-bedroom accessible housing units, and will renovate kitchens in one of its developments upon request by a tenant. RHA also will maintain a list of landlords who participate in the Section 8 program that specifically includes information about whether each has accessible units, and will provide that information to all tenant participants who have received a housing voucher. Finally, RHA has adopted and agreed to implement a new Assistance Animal Policy that will protect the rights of persons with disabilities to keep assistance animals, and has agreed to return to the individual complainant the $50 it now holds as a deposit.\n\nRedeemer Fellowship of Edisto Island v. Town of Edisto Beach (D. S.C.)\n\nOn November 18, 2018, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in U.S. District Court in South Carolina supporting a church’s claim that the Town of Edisto Beach violated its rights under the First Amendment when the Town barred it from renting space at the Town’s Civic Center. The case, Redeemer Fellowship of Edisto Island v. Town of Edisto Beach, involves a small Christian congregation that sought to rent space for Sunday worship in the Civic Center, which is available for rental by community groups to hold events and activities. The Town responded by enacting a policy barring worship services at the Civic Center, citing separation of church and state concerns. The church filed a First Amendment suit and sought a preliminary injunction to allow it to rent the facility. The United States’ statement of interest argues that far from being a justification for barring the church from the facility, the Constitution requires that churches be allowed to rent facilities on an equal basis with other community groups. The United States notes that the Supreme Court in 1981 held that a university could not “discriminate against student groups and speakers based on their desire to use a generally open forum to engage in religious worship and discussion,” and that later cases make clear this applies to other types of forums opened up by governments. On December 31, 2018, the Town voluntarily rescinded its ban on religious worship services at its Civic Center. On March 18, 2019, the court issued an order dismissing the church’s request for a preliminary injunction as moot because the Town remedied the illegal conduct through a legislative enactment. The court keeps the church’s requests for damages and declaratory relief, however, and orders that the private parties work the issue of damages out amongst themselves.\n\nReed, et al. v. Penasquitos Casablanca Owner's Association (9th Cir.)\n\nA federal court jury in San Diego, California found that the defendants employee, a condominium security guard, had sexually harassed the plaintiff. However, the judge refused to let the claims of the plaintiff's two sons and grandson go to the jury. The judge also refused to let the jury consider whether to grant punitive damages. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Civil Rights Division filed an amicus brief on November 7, 2008, arguing that the claims of the children should have gone to the jury, and the judge should have allowed the jury to decide whether to award punitive damages.\n\nRegional Economic Community Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nIn June 17, 1998, the United States intervened as plaintiffs in Regional Economic Community Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, a private action that was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint joined the private plaintiff, a nonprofit corporation, in alleging that the City violated the Fair Housing Act when it refused them permission to operate a residential facility for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. In 2000, the court granted the City's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, agreeing with the complainants that the court applied the wrong legal standard. The Second Circuit decision is reported as Regional Economic Community Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2002). Private plaintiffs subsequently reached a settlement with the City. The Division agreed to dismissal of our complaint in order to facilitate the settlement. The case was handled primarily by the United States Attorney's office.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas v. The City of Mission Woods, Kansas (D. Kan.)\n\nOn August 30, 2018, the United States received a favorable decision in Roman Catholic Archdiocese v. City of Mission Woods (D. Kan.). The United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiff, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City, Kansas, on May 24, 2018. In the memorandum opinion, the Court denied both parties’ request for summary judgment and closely followed the analysis urged by the United States in setting the case for trial. In the statement of interest, the United States addressed RLUIPA’s substantial burden standard within the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit has defined substantial burden under the statute as government actions that prevent participation in religious conduct motivated by a sincerely held belief. The United States argued that to decide whether government action prevents participation in religious conduct requires a holistic analysis that focuses on whether a religious institution has a reasonable expectation of approval, the existence of feasible alternatives for religious exercise and whether pursuing alternatives would cause the religious institution substantial delay, uncertainty, and expense. The United States contended that other federal courts had considered these factors, and that the Archdiocese had presented sufficient evidence of each to avoid summary judgment on its substantial burden claim.\n\nSailak, LLC v. Forsyth County, Georgia (N.D. Ga.)\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the district court denied the County’s Motion for Summary Judgment in Sailak, LLC and Sumaltha Satoor v. Forsyth County (N.D. Ga.). The case involves claims that the County substantially burdened the Plaintiffs’ religious exercise and discriminated against them in violation of RLUIPA when it denied them a conditional use permit to develop a Hindu temple on their property. After Plaintiffs filed their complaint, the County moved to have the complaint dismissed, arguing that Plaintiffs lacked standing in that private restrictions on the Plaintiffs’ land barred them from challenging the denial of the permit under RLUIPA. The Division filed a statement of interest on January 27, 2020, arguing that the Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA’s claims should proceed because the court can remedy the alleged harm by the County. The court held that Plaintiffs have standing to bring their RLUIPA claims because if the Plaintiffs were successful on their RLUIPA claims, they would be entitled to the CUP they were improperly denied and that it was “undisputed” that the County has never had the power to enforce the private restrictions. The court also ordered the parties to continue with discovery on merits of Plaintiffs’ RLUIPA claims.\n\nSherman Avenue Tenants' Association v. District of Columbia (D.D.C.)\n\nOn June 12, 2001, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in an action brought by four tenant associations against the District of Columbia for selective and discriminatory code enforcement in the Columbia Heights area on the basis of national origin in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The District argued that because the District is neither a \"provider of housing\" nor a \"municipal service provider,\" it cannot be held liable under Sections 3604(a) and (b) of the Act. The United States' amicus brief in opposition to the District's motion to dismiss argued that the District's alleged actions of closing and/or threatening to close buildings in areas of the District with high concentrations of Latinos and Vietnamese makes housing unavailable. Finally, the United States argued that the tenant associations have standing to bring a claim on their own behalf, as well as on behalf of their members.\n\nSouthwest Key Programs, Inc. v. City of Escondido (S.D. Cal.)\n\nOn March 23, 2017, the court issued an order denying the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment in Southwest Key Programs, Inc. v. City of Escondido (S.D. Cal.), finding that there were triable issues as to whether the group home at issue constitutes a dwelling under the Fair Housing Act. The United States had filed a statement of interest in this case on November 3, 2016, to address the question whether the protections of the Fair Housing Act extend to group homes for unaccompanied children in the care and custody of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff in the case sought to operate such a home in the City of Escondido and alleges that the city discriminated on the basis of race and national origin when it denied the request for a conditional use permit to operate the group home. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that the FHA does not apply. The United States’ statement of interest urged the court to find that the proposed group home is a “dwelling” covered by the Fair Housing Act and is neither a jail nor a detention facility.\n\nSyringa Property Management, Inc.\n\nOn August 15, 2001, the United States and the Intermountain Fair Housing Council (IFHC) entered into a settlement agreement with Syringa Property Management, Inc., resolving the IFHC's allegations that Syringa had, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, required disabled tenants to pay deposits in order to keep service or support animals in apartments managed by Syringa. Under the settlement agreement, Syringa will not charge deposits or fees to disabled tenants in connection with the maintenance of service or support animals.\n\nTexas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (S. Ct.)\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (S. Ct.) that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act. The Supreme Court's ruling was consistent with the position taken in an amicus brief filed by the United States on December 23, 2014. The United States argued that HUD, the agency charged with interpreting the Act, has authoritatively interpreted the FHA to provide for disparate impact claims by means entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, including in a formal regulation promulgated in 2013 and in formal adjudications. The United States further argued that HUD's construction of the FHA follows directly from the text, structure, and history the FHA. Finally, the United States argued that a state or local government does not violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause merely by considering whether a proposed action will have a disparate impact on the basis of race.\n\nSettlement Agreement U.S. and Tiberti-Blood, Inc., John David Burke, L.R. Nelson Civil Engineers, and the Spanish Gardens Condominiums Homeowners Association\n\nOn April 1, 2003, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with the developer, architect, site engineer, and homeowners association of Spanish Gardens Condominiums (respondents) in suburban Las Vegas, Nevada. As reflected in the agreement, the respondents failed to design and construct 112 ground-level units and various public and common use areas of the Spanish Gardens Condominiums, a/k/a Desert Lion Condominiums, to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Previous to the signing of the agreement, the respondents had already retrofitted a portion of the common use and public areas at an approximate cost of $35,000. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the respondents will within 60 days of the Agreement, submit a plan for completion of the remaining required retrofits to the common areas, for approval by the Division. Additionally, the respondents will create an $11,000 fund for use by any homeowner to retrofit the interior of his or her unit. After an initial notice, owners shall receive additional notices of the opportunity to retrofit their units, at no cost to them, on an annual basis for three years. The respondents shall also report information regarding future design or construction of multi-family housing and certify to the Department that such design or construction fully complies with the Act. This matter was referred to the Division by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\nThomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission (9th Cir.)\n\nTwo landlords whose religious beliefs prevented them from renting housing to unmarried couples filed a federal action asking the court to find that any enforcement against them of Alaska or Anchorage laws prohibiting discrimination in housing on the basis of marital status would violate their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the statutes substantially burdened the landlords' religious beliefs and that the government had no compelling interest in prohibiting marital status discrimination in housing, and affirmed the district court's order prohibiting the State and the City from enforcing the laws against the landlords. On December 22, 1999, the United States filed an amicus brief when the court of appeals withdrew the panel opinion and decided to rehear the case en banc. The United States argued that the Alaska and Anchorage statutes are neutral and generally applicable exercises of the police power, and that the landlords in these appeals have failed to show \"colorable\" claims under the Takings Clause or Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The en banc court held that the landlords' claim was not ripe, and dismissed the action. In October, 2000, the landlord-plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, arguing that they had met the standing and ripeness requirements of Article III of the United States Constitution. In February 2001, the Supreme Court denied the landlords' petition.\n\nTony Roque v. Seattle Housing Authority (W.D. Wash.)\n\nOn June 12, the United States filed a statement of interest in Roque v. Seattle Housing Authority (W.D. Wash.) a Fair Housing Act case alleging denial of a reasonable accommodation for an on-site parking space for the caregiver of a tenant with disabilities. The United States argued that a parking space for a caregiver may, under certain circumstances, be a reasonable accommodation.\n\nTrop Edmond, L.P. (Nev.)\n\nOn March 14, 2001, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with Trop-Edmond, L.P.; Trail Properties, Inc.; and Danielian Associates (respondents), thereby resolving the United States' claims that respondents discriminated on the basis of disability by failing to design and construct units at West Trop Condominiums in Las Vegas, Nevada, to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This case was referred to the Division by HUD as a pattern or practice case. After respondents were contacted by HUD regarding a complaint of design and construction deficiencies, respondents took corrective actions at an approximate cost of $41,000. Under the terms of the settlement, respondents Trop-Edmond, L.P. and Trail Properties, Inc. will donate $5000 to an organization in Nevada that serves the housing needs of persons with disabilities. Respondent Danielian will conduct annual in-house training for a period of three years to its employees involved in the design of multi-family dwellings.\n\nTrujillo v. Board of Directors of Triumvera Tower Condominium Association (N.D. Ill.)\n\nOn September 8, 2004, the court entered a consent order resolving Trujillo v. Board of Directors of Triumvera Tower Condominium Association (N.D. Ill.). The United States' complaint, which was filed on May 13, 2004, alleged the condominium association engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of disability when they established a written policy prohibiting persons in wheelchairs from using the front door to the condominium building and when they applied that policy to a ten-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair who lives in the building. The consent order requires the defendants to: pay $70,000 to the complainants; admit that their actions violated the Fair Housing Act; issue a letter of apology; pay $10,000 to the widow of a Triumvera resident who used a wheelchair during the last years of his life, and pay a $3,500 civil penalty. The consent order also requires the president of the association's board of directors to resign, issue new by-laws, and require training of its members on the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. The complainants filed a lawsuit in this matter in March, 2004.\n\nTurning Point Foundation v. DeStefano (D. Conn.)\n\nOn May 13, 2008, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in Turning Point Foundation v. DeStefano (D. Conn.). This is a Fair Housing Act disability discrimination case filed by the owners of two recovery houses for people with addictions, who allege that the city of New Haven failed to make a reasonable accommodation by allowing more than eight to ten persons to reside in the houses. On February 22, 2008, the United States filed a brief as amicus curiae to address legal issues raised by defendants, without taking a position on the merits of the summary judgment motion. The court's opinion, which was entered on May 13, 2008, found that there are material issues of fact in dispute, without addressing any of the contested legal issues.\n\nVeles v. Lindow (9th Cir.)\n\nOn August 23, 1999, the United States filed an amicus brief in Veles v. Lindow (9th Cir.). The brief asserted the Fair Housing Act prohibits actions with discriminatory effects on the basis of national origin. The brief also alleged English only rules imposed by a landlord may violate the Fair Housing Act.\n\nUnited States v. 118 East 60th Owners, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn March 25, 2019, the United States Attorney's Office filed a complaint and proposed consent decree in United States v. 118 East 60th Owners, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint alleges that the owner and property manager Matthew Adam Properties of a 232-unit housing cooperative in New York, NY violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a tenant with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to keep an emotional support beagle in his unit. The case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation and issued a charge of discrimination. The court entered the consent decree on March 28, 2019.\n\nUnited States v. 2 Gold, LLC (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn June 5, 2014, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. 2 Gold, LLC (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint, which was filed on April 23, 2013, alleged that the defendants failed to design and construct 2 Gold Street, a rental apartment complex in Manhattan, so that it was accessible to persons with disabilities. The decree resolves the United States' claims against the architect defendants. It provides for injunctive relief, review of the architects' future designs by a qualified compliance reviewer, a civil penalty of $35,000, and a payment of $45,000 into a fund to compensate aggrieved persons. It also includes an admission by the architects that they provided design services with respect to 2 Gold Street and that, as built, certain features of the complex did not meet the accessibility standards established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Another consent decree, entered April 24, 2013, resolved the United States' claims against the developers.\n\nUnited States v. 4 Anchorage Lane Owners, Inc. (E.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn July 8, 2011, the court entered a stipulation and order of settlement in United States v. 4 Anchorage Lane Owners, Inc. (E.D.N.Y.). The complaint, which was filed by the United States Attorney's Office on July 5, 2011, alleged that a 156-unit cooperative housing complex in Oyster Bay, New York discriminated against a HUD complainant on the basis of disability, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2) and (f)(3)(B) of the Fair Housing Act. The complainant has a mobility impairment that requires him to use a walker and, at times, a wheelchair. The housing complex refused to modify its first-come, first-served parking policy to designate an accessible parking space close to his unit for his exclusive use. The stipulation of settlement requires defendants to designate a particular accessible space for the complainant's exclusive use and gives him thirty days to intervene if wishes to pursue additional relief against the defendants. The case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nUnited States v. 61 Main Street Corp. (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn December 2, 2013, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. 61 Main Street Corp. (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint, also filed on December 2, 2013, alleged that 61 Main Street Corporation and Rosario Marci have engaged in conduct constituting discrimination on the basis of race under the Fair Housing Act. Specifically, the United States alleges that the defendants failed to inform African-American prospective tenants about available apartments, while telling Caucasian prospective tenants, even on the same day, that apartments were in fact available. The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to show available apartments and give rental applications to African-American prospective tenants, but showed available apartments and gave rental applications to Caucasian prospective tenants, even on the same day. Finally, the complaint alleges that the defendants provided higher rent prices and less favorable security deposit terms to African-American prospective tenants than those offered to similarly situated Caucasian prospective tenants. The consent decree requires the defendants, to refrain from discriminating on the basis of race in their rental practices, and to implement a non-discrimination policy and non-discriminatory standards and procedures at the apartment complex located at 123 South Broadway. In addition, the defendants will pay $60,000 into a fund for the compensation of victims of their discriminatory conduct, as well as a $32,000 civil penalty to the United States.\n\nUnited States v. 75 Main Ave. Owners Corp. (E.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn January 26, 2010, the court entered a settlement agreement and order in United States v. 75 Main Ave. Owners Corp. (E.D.N.Y.), an election case referred by HUD. The complaint, filed in September 2008, alleged that a cooperative apartment building in Rockville Centre, New York and its board of directors refused to allow a 90-year old woman with depression to keep a small assistance dog. The settlement enjoins defendants from future discrimination and requires them to implement a reasonable accommodation procedure, refrain from enforcing the \"no pets\" rule against the HUD complainant as long as she lives at the coop and withdraw their pending state court action against the complainant. The court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement for three years. This case was litigated by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nUnited States v. 111 East 88th Partners (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn July 14, 2020, the court entered a consent order in United States v. 111 East 88th Partners (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint, which was filed in December 2016, and was subsequently amended, alleges that the owner and operator of an apartment complex refused to make a reasonable accommodation to allow a person with a disability to keep an assistance animal in his home. The consent order requires defendant to allow the complainant to keep an assistance dog for as long as he lives at the premises, dismiss its holdover proceedings action against him and obtain training and adopt a reasonable accommodations policy. This case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nUnited States v. 475 Ninth Avenue Associates, LLC (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn May 25, 2012, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. 475 Ninth Avenue Associates, LLC (S.D.N.Y.), a Fair Housing Act pattern or practice design and construction case alleging discrimination on the basis of disability. The complaint, filed together with the consent decree by the United States Attorney's Office on May 25, 2012, alleges that the defendants failed to design and construct Hudson Crossing, a 259-unit apartment building in New York City, in compliance with the Fair Housing Act's accessibility guidelines. The decree provides injunctive relief and requires retrofits of certain noncompliant features in the public and common-use areas and within the dwellings. The decree requires the defendants to pay up to $115,000 to compensate persons aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory housing practices at Hudson Crossing, with unspent monies to be distributed to a qualified organization conducting fair housing enforcement-related activities in New York City. A civil penalty of $20,000 is also imposed.\n\nUnited States v. 505 Central Avenue Corp. (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn July 20, 2017, the court entered a stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal in United States v. 505 Central Ave. (S.D.N.Y.), a Fair Housing Act pattern-or-practice/election case. The parties executed a settlement agreement on June 29 to resolve this lawsuit, filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office on January 18, 2017, alleging that a housing cooperative and management company discriminated against an individual with disabilities when it refused a reasonable accommodation to allow him to purchase a coop unit at Thompkins Manor using a special needs trust. Under the terms of the settlement agreement the defendants must pay a total of $125,000, including compensatory damages and attorney’s fees to the complainant and civil penalties to the United States.

Acme Investments, Inc. (E.D. Mich.)\n\nOn July 7, 2010, the court entered a consent decree resolving all claims in United States v. Acme Investments, Inc. (E.D. Mich.). The complaint, filed by the United States and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan on March 3, 2010, alleged a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act by the owner and property manager, Laurie Courtney of Ivanhoe House Apartments located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The complaint alleged discrimination against African Americans in the rental and inspection of apartments. The case was developed through testing conducted by the Fair Housing Center of Southeastern Michigan, which filed suit on July 16, 2009, alleging the same violations. The cases were later consolidated by the court. Under the settlement, the defendants will pay $35,000 in damages to three victims who the United States contends were discriminated against because of their race at Ivanhoe House Apartments; pay $7,500 in a civil penalty to the United States; and pay $40,000 to the Fair Housing Center of Southeastern Michigan as damages for the non-profit's efforts in testing and investigating the apartment complex.

This case was handled jointly by the United States and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. The consent decree will remain in effect for three years.\n\nUnited States v. Adams (W.D. Ark.)\n\nOn October 1, 2007, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Adams (W.D. Ark.).

This case was based on evidence developed through the Division's Fair Housing Testing Program.\n\nUnited States v. ADI Management, Inc. (E.D.N.Y.)\n\nOn July 2, 2003, the court entered the consent decree in United States v. ADI Management, Inc. (E.D.N.Y.). The United States Attorney's Office brought this action on behalf of the estate of the complainant, who lived at the subject property until she died from metastatic breast cancer at the age of 34. The complaint, filed on June 5, 2002, alleged that the defendants, the owner and property management company of an apartment complex in Jamaica Estates, Queens, violated the Fair Housing Act when they failed to make a reasonable accommodation to their no-pets rule to allow the complainant to keep an emotional support dog in her unit, and instead served her with eviction notices. The Division alleged that she was suffering from anxiety and depression, caused by being mobility-impaired due to the cancer. The consent decree requires defendants to pay $11,000 in damages to the estate of the complainant. The decree also enjoins the defendants from: violating the Fair Housing Act on the basis of disability in the future; requires them to adopt specific guidelines for assessing requests for reasonable accommodations; and requires the president of the property management company to attend a fair housing training program.
