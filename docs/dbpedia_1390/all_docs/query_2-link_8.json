        "text": "RICHMOND — After noting the “unbelievable” nature of a 2019 drive-by murder motivated by a traffic dispute, a Contra Costa judge sentenced both defendants — including a woman who was pregnant at the time of her arrest and had been released from jail to take care of her newborn — to life in prison.\n\nTearri Richard and Lakia Poles, both 26, were sentenced Friday morning to life in the 2019 murder of Raul Garcia, 57, of Antioch. Richard, the shooter, was given no possibility for parole. Poles will have a shot at parole after serving 25 years.\n\nBefore the sentence was handed down, Raul Garcia’s brother, Rudy Garcia, delivered an emotional statement in which he berated, forgave, and at times mocked both defendants. Rudy Garcia in the car with Raul Garcia at the time of his shooting and wasn’t injured, but watched helplessly as his brother died minutes later.\n\n“They took my brother’s life,” Rudy Garcia said in court, Friday. “I was in that car, I could’ve got killed too…I shouldn’t say I forgive them, in my heart I don’t, but God with me, I do.”\n\nRudy Garcia told Richard to “be a man” and face him while he was talking, and, turning to Poles, told her, “it’s too bad you made that call, huh?” He later said, “I wish this would’ve never happened.”\n\n“You can’t touch no baby no more,” Garcia said to Poles. “Just like I can’t touch my brother no more…You should’ve taken my advice and just walked away.”\n\nThe Garcia brothers, and a third friend, were loading stuff into their truck from a storage unit in Pittsburg the day of the shooting. On the drive home, they got into an altercation at a red light, after a near-collision between their truck and Poles’ car. During the argument, Richard threatened the victims, prosecutors said at trial.\n\nWhat ensued was a frightening ordeal where Poles followed the Garcias’ truck onto Highway 4 and into Antioch, as they tried frantically to evade her. At one point, the Garcias exited the freeway, ran a red light, then doubled back on Highway 4 in the other direction, but Poles was able to keep up with them. As she called in their position, Richard went to his apartment nearby to retrieve a pistol, prosecutors said.\n\nWith Poles’ assistance, Richard located the truck and opened fire, striking Raul Garcia. He died a short distance away, at an Antioch residence.\n\n“It is unfathomable that a man’s life could be taken over disagreement about a lane merger that didn’t even result in a collision, yet defendants Richard and Poles hunted Raul Garcia down in the street and killed him for something that trivial; they both deserve the life sentences they were given,” Deputy District Attorney Aron DeFerrari, who prosecuted the case, said after the sentences Friday. “The justice achieved today was only possible due to the outstanding investigation by the Antioch Police Department and their top notch Detective Division.”\n\nWhen Richard and Poles were arrested weeks later, Poles was pregnant, and gave birth while still in jail. She was given pretrial release while the charges were pending so she could care for her newborn, but re-arrested after she and Richard were convicted at trial last year. Her attorney, Adam Burke, asked Superior Court Judge Patricia Scanlon for “mercy” in and to grant probation, not prison, in light of the unique circumstances around Poles’ situation.\n\n“There would be no violations, she’d complete (probation) successfully, and she’d never be in court before a judge for the rest of her life,” Burke said. He later added, “her daughters need her.”\n\nBut Scanlon wouldn’t budge.\n\n“While I am aware Ms. Poles conducted herself with dignity throughout the trial and did make all of her court appearances, that is not the full story of her life and what occurred on this particular night,” Scanlon said. She later added, “Ms. Poles could have made the decision at any time while she was following the Garcias to stop it…It was in her power to stop that conduct, and she chose not to.”\n\nIn 2017, Richard was acquitted of two murders in a double homicide in San Jose that resulted from a marijuana robbery. A family member of the victims in that case attempted to speak in court Friday but Scanlon said it wouldn’t be appropriate, given that Richard was found not guilty in that case."
