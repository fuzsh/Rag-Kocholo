        "text": "In addition to the 25 prospects that our minor league crew designated as the most impactful in the system, there are a number of other players in the Mets’ minor leagues that deserve a mention. With any luck, a few of these will turn into productive Mets in just a few years.\n\nBohan Adderley, INF/OF\n\nNassau native Bohan Adderley signed with the Mets on the first day of the 2024-2025 international signing period, the first player the organization added from the Bahamas since infielder Warren Saunders, who was signed in August 2018. The organization was only made aware of him recently, and within a span of a few months, the athletic 17-year-old had his name expedited from local evaluators to the organizational regional cross-checker to the Vice President of International Scouting.\n\nAt the plate, Adderley stands slightly open with his hands high and swings with a moderate leg kick. The 6’3” Bahamian weighs 190-pounds but doesn’t look it, as his frame is still lanky and slim, suggesting future growth and muscle mass. One of the better players available in the 2024-2025 international rookie class from the Bahamas, Adderley has a fluid right-handed stroke, showing barrel control and the ability to make loud contact. Additionally, he has above-average, arguably plus speed, as evidence by running the 60-yard dash in 6.5 seconds.\n\nAdderley also has a strong arm, and while pitching in exhibition games across the Bahamas could throw a fastball that sat in the low-80s and hit the mid-80s. Additionally, though he is unlikely to pitch as a professional, he also thew a mid-to-high-70s curveball and a high-70s-to-low-80s slider. His strong arm, along with his speed and athleticism, profiles excellently in right field, with the potential for center field depending on his ability to get a better feel for the ball off the bat and the best routes to take him to the ball.\n\nEris Albino, RHP\n\nEris Albino was signed by the Mets in mid-February 2022 out of Yaguate, a municipality located roughly 30 miles from San Cristóbal that is also the birthplace of pitchers Michael Pineda, Jose Ramirez, Arodys Vizcaíno, and Jeurys Familia. Already 18, the right-hander was not considered a premium prospect. He was assigned to the Dominican Summer League, where he was rostered on both Mets DSL squads. In 26.2 innings in 14 total games, he posted a 6.41 ERA, allowing 9 hits, walking 34, and striking out 25. He did not pitch in 2023 due to an injury that kept him off the mound for the entire season.\n\nAlbino throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a long action through the back, though sometimes his slot raises to virtually overhand. The slot inconsistency, along with follow through inconsistencies, resulted in major release point variations, negatively impacting his command. The right-hander struggled to throw strikes in 2022, overthrowing and releasing the ball early, evidenced by a 11.5 BB/9 and 13.5 BB% walk rate.\n\nDespite that, batters had a hard time squaring up on Albino. His fastball reportedly touched 99 MPH prior to his injury, though the pitch generally sat in the mid-90s. Albino had trouble maintaining that velocity, and it generally slipped in to the low-to-mid-90s by the end of innings, but at 6’6”, 230-pounds, the right-hander should eventually be able to maintain the higher end of his velocity band longer. Albino also threw a two-seam variant that features arm-side life and was also developing slider with slight break.\n\nMatthew Allan, RHP\n\nAfter helping lead Seminole High School to its first state championship since, Matthew Allan entered the draft ranked among the best prep pitchers in this year’s class. While not a complete unknown coming into the 2019 season, Matthew Allan wasn’t exactly at the top of the draft boards. Thanks to a strong showcase on the summer circuit in 2018 and then an excellent spring- which included a perfect game- Allan rocketed up the draft boards. While his talent on the mound was undeniable, a strong commitment to the University of Florida and other concerns scared teams away from drafting him in the early rounds of the 2019 MLB Draft. After Allan ended up going unselected on the first night of the 2019 MLB Draft, Marc Tramuta and Tommy Tanous had a long night ahead of them, making phone calls and carefully planning how they would navigate day two of the draft. When the it came the Mets’ turn to select when the second day of the draft began, they selected Allan with their third-round pick, the 89th selection overall. The Mets drafted inexpensive college seniors for the rest of day two in order to save money in their bonus pool, and the two sides eventually agreed to a $2.5 million signing bonus, well above the MLB-assigned slot value of $667,900.\n\nThe right-hander was assigned to the GCL Mets to start his professional career. There, he posted a 1.08 ERA in 8.1 innings, allowing 5 hits, walking 4, and striking out 11. Shortly after the GCL season came to a premature close due to the threat of Hurricane Dorian, the Mets promoted Allan to the Brooklyn Cyclones, to get him some more work and to help bolster the Cyclones’ pitching staff as they sought to secure a playoff spot. Allan debuted for the Cyclones against the Staten Island Yankees in their last series of the season, giving up two runs on five hits and a walk over two innings, striking out three. The Cyclones clinched a postseason berth a few days later, and Allan played an important role in their playoff run, throwing five perfect innings with two strikeouts in two multi-inning relief appearances, including the winner-take-all championship series game three.\n\nThanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, he did not get to play in 2020, but he was invited to the Coney Island alternate site and the fall instructional league, where he impressed many in the organization. Allan was due to return to Brooklyn in 2021, now the Mets’ High-A affiliate, but missed the entire season after it was announced in early May that he had partially tore his ulnar collateral ligament and needed Tommy John surgery. Just prior to the start of the 2022 season, Allan underwent ulnar transposition surgery, a common follow-up operation for those who have Tommy John. With a recovery of time between 3 to 6 before he would be able to return to baseball activities, the chance remained for Allan to pitch in 2022, but he did not, getting as far as throwing on flat ground by the time the season ended. In January, the right-hander underwent UCL revision surgery, in effect a second Tommy John, ending any chance of him pitching in 2023.\n\nThrowing from a three-quarters arm slot with a high leg kick, Allan has fluid, effortless mechanics and a strong, durable frame, which should allow him the ability to soak up innings in the future. At 6’3”, 225-pounds, he is mostly filled in, but there may still be a bit of room left in his frame to add muscle. He periodically has control problems related to his arm action in the back, but Allan is otherwise mechanically sound.\n\nBefore his Tommy John surgery and subsequent UCL revision surgery, Allan’s fastball lived in the mid-90s, sitting 94-95 with the ability to top out a few miles per hour high, at 97 MPH. Combined with the arm-side run it had, the pitch was above-average, with the ability to improve. Once the 22-year-old right-hander returns from his rehab, how effective this pitch is will depend on how much velocity he is able to throw it for and whether or not he will continue to be able to ramp it up and occasionally hit the upper-90s with it. Allan was able to command it well also, spotting it to all four quadrants of the strike zone.\n\nComplementing his fastball was a curveball and changeup, the former of which is his best offering at present. Sitting in the high-70s-to-low-70s with sharp 11-5 break, Allan’s curveball was one of the best in the entire 2019 MLB Draft class. He had an excellent feel for it and is able to command it, peppering it in the strike zone and burying it to get batters fishing. Like his fastball, the pitch was an above-average offering at the present, with the potential to improve. A pitcher’s ability to spin a breaking ball generally returns slower than his other pitches after undergoing Tommy John surgery, so how effective his curve is when he returns to the mound and additional refinements to it will be key to his development. Rounding out his arsenal, his changeup lagged behind his other pitches in its effectiveness, but it showed considerable promise. Sitting 85-87 MPH, when the pitch was working, it featured arm-side tumble and fade; when it was not, it was firm and lost most of its vertical drop but still maintained an effective velocity differential.\n\nJostyn Almonte, OF\n\nSigned out of the Dominican Republic during the 2019-2020 international free agent signing period for $80,000, Jostyn Almonte was raw as a ballplayer but had a handful of loud tools. Making his professional debut in 2021, assigned to the DSL Mets, Almonte hit .164/.247/.206 in 25 games with 3 doubles, 4 stolen bases in 6 attempts, and 5 walks to 21 strikeouts. He remained in the Dominican Summer League in 2022, now 19-years-old and appeared in 38 games for both Mets DSL squadrons, hitting .263/.436/.347 with 2 doubles, 2 home runs, 7 stolen bases in 11 attempts, and 24 walks to 34 strikeouts. The Mets kept him in the DSL in 2023, and he appeared in 45 games for the DSL Mets Blue, hitting .311/.443/.507 with 9 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, 14 stolen bases in 18 attempts, and 29 walks to 42 strikeouts.\n\nStanding 5’11” and weighing 195 pounds, Almonte is built like a linebacker, with powerful legs and thick, broad shoulders. At the plate, he stands slightly open, holding his hands high, wrapping the bat behind his head, and swinging with a slight toe tap timing mechanism. Almonte stung the ball in 2023, averaging a 93.7 MPH exit velocity on publicly available batted ball events, but how much of that was due to mechanical adjustments he made with his swing and how much of that was due to his advanced age in the DSL remains to be seen. He hit fewer balls on the ground as compared to years past, and did indeed blister many groundball past fielders, but going forward, against better competition, fewer of those balls will get by fielders for hits.\n\nAlmonte is athletic and possesses above-average speed, which helps him on the basepaths and in the outfield. His speed gives him plenty of range, allowing him to play center field, but he is better suited for right field, as his arm is above-average and less pressure will be put on his reaction times, instincts, and outfield routes.\n\nRyan Ammons, LHP\n\nRyan Ammons lettered in baseball four times and in basketball twice while attending Wren High School in South Carolina. He excelled in baseball, and decided to pursue it in college, committing to the alma mater of both of his parents, Clemson University. Despite being a follow by scouts and evaluators, he went undrafted in the 2019 MLB Draft.\n\nThe southpaw was perfect in 2020. In his and only appearance of the year on February 29, he faced a single batter and recorded an out, giving him a 0.00 ERA in 0.1 innings on the season, as the NCAA suspended all baseball activity a few days later on March 12. He returned to the Tigers in 2021, his redshirt freshman season and appeared in 8 games, posting a 4.50 ERA in 4.0 innings, allowing 4 hits, walking 6, and striking out 9. That summer, he played for the Strasburg Express of the Valley League, a wood bat summer collegiate league in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia. The Express won the 2021 VBL Championship and Ammons contributed to their success by posting a 0.96 ERA in 18.2 innings thrown over 12 games, allowing 8 hits, walking 7, and striking out 32.\n\nThe southpaw returned to Clemson in 2022, his redshirt sophomore season, and was used in higher leverage situations by head coach Monte Lee, saving 8 games. Ammons appeared in 25 games total and posted a 4.61 ERA in 27.1 innings, allowing 20 hits, walking 14, and striking out 40. In 2023, the southpaw was named team co-captain along with infielder Riley Bertram and Blake Wright and reliever Jackson Lindley. He was named the Tigers’ Friday starter by new head coach Erik Bakich, but the transition from reliever to starting pitcher only lasted two games, as Ammons strained his forearm and missed roughly a month-and-a-half, from the end of February to the middle of April. When he returned to the mound, he was inserted back into the bullpen, where he saved 5 games. In 20.0 innings, he posted a 4.05 ERA over 13 games, allowing 17 hits, walking 8, and striking out 26.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the collegiate season, Ammons was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 10th round of the 2023 MLB Draft. The 22-year-old signed for $50,000, saving the Red Sox roughly $115,000 as the MLB-recommended slot value for the 298th player selected was $167,900. The left-hander was assigned to the FCL Red Sox but did not suit up for them at any point, as he was placed on the Injured List for the entire season. That winter, following the 2023 Rule 5 Draft, the Mets traded right-handed pitcher recently selected draftee Justin Slaten and cash considerations to the Red Sox in exchange for Ammons.\n\nThe southpaw throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action through the back. There is some effort in his delivery as he coils up and uncorks towards the plate. While his delivery has a negative impact on his command, he did not walk an excessive number of batters while pitching at Clemson; the additional bat missing ability the deception in his delivery gives his pitches is well worth a grade or so less of command. The left-hander has always worked better glove-side and has had trouble throwing to both sides of the plate.\n\nAmmons primarily is a fastball-slider pitcher, occasionally mixing in a split-changeup. His fastball sits in the low-90s and tops out at 94 MPH. Because drops-and-drives off the mound with a low release point, the pitch is thrown with a high vertical approach angle, making it difficult to get on top of. His slider sits in the high-70s-to-low-80s, 78-81 MPH, and features big, sweepy break across the zone. His changeup sits in the low-to-mid-80s and features sharp drop. Though he uses the slider more and has more confidence in it, his changeup may have more potential if he is able to refine the pitch further.\n\nEli Ankeney, LHP\n\nThe Freshman Athlete of the Year in 2016 in his first year playing at Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona, Eli Ankeney was a four-year letter winner who helped lead the Desert Vista Thunder to the playoffs in 2019, his senior year. Over the course of his four years there, the left-hander posted a 3.85 ERA in 123.2 innings, allowing 136 hits, walking 58, and striking out 152. In 2018, his junior season, the southpaw posted a 3.60 ERA in 48.2 innings with 52 hits allowed, 25 walks, and 63 strikeouts, and in 2019, his senior year, he posted a 3.87 ERA in 50.2 innings with 55 hits allowed, 22 walks, and 69 strikeouts. In addition to his ability on the mound, Ankeney hit .346/.442/.602 in 156 at-bats. His grandfather, Gary Fite, played baseball and basketball at Loyola Marymount University, but in the end, Ankeney decided to stay more local, attending Grand Canyon University.\n\nThe southpaw did not play in 2020, his freshman year, because of an injury, but regardless, healthy or injured, it really would not have mattered much as the NCAA cancelled the season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He only appeared in a single game in 2021, throwing a perfect inning with one strikeout, but was able to pitch some supplementary innings with the Bend Elks of the West Coast League that summer. He returned to the Antelopes in 2022 and appeared in 29 games out of the bullpen and posted a 2.68 ERA in 40.1 innings, allowing 28 hits, walking 13, and striking out 61. After the season ended, he pitched a few more supplemental innings for the Mahoning Valley Scrappers of the MLB Draft League before being drafted by the Mets in the Drafted by the New York Mets in the 20th round of the 2022 MLB Draft.\n\nThe left-hander pitched limited innings with the FCL Mets that summer, his professional career starting in earnest in 2023. He was assigned to the St. Lucie Mets and pitched there for roughly two months before being promoted to the Brooklyn Cyclones. With St. Lucie, Ankeney did not allow a single earned run in 9.0 innings over 6 games, scattering a pair of hits, walking two, and striking out 14. With the Brooklyn Cyclones, he posted a 3.94 ERA in 32.0 innings over 21 games, allowing 26 hits, walking 22, and striking out 37. The southpaw was extremely impressive with the Cyclones for most of the summer, running into a wall over the final month of the season or so; in his first 22 games, Ankeney allowed 5 earned runs over 23.2 innings and in his last five, he allowed 9 earned runs in 8.1 innings.\n\nAnkeney throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a long action through the back and a bit of crossfire at times. His arm slot creates good downhill angle and gives his pitches some additional arm-side run. His fastball sits in the high-80s-to-low-90s, averaging 92 MPH. He complements it with a split-finger changeup and a slider. His split-change sits in the low-to-mid-80s, averaging 83 MPH. His slider sits in the high-70s-to-low-80s, averaging 80 MPH. Since going pro, the southpaw has had trouble commanding and controlling his pitches.\n\nDonovan Antonia, C\n\nWillemstad, Curacao native Donovan Antonia signed with the Cincinnati Reds as an international rookie on August 13, 2019, his birthday and the day he turned 16, making him officially eligible to sign. He received a $200,000 and was expected to play in the Dominican Summer League in 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic cancelled the season, so he had to wait until 2021 to make his professional debut. The Reds pushed the 17-year-old, sending him stateside to the Arizona Complex League. He appeared in 33 games for them and hit .155/.268/.255 with 4 doubles, 2 triples, 1 home run, 4 stolen bases in 5 attempts, and 14 walks to 52 strikeouts. Young for the level to begin with, Cincinnati had Antonia repeat the level in 2022, and the right-hander responded, hitting .261/.377/.489 in 29 games with 8 doubles, 4 home runs, 3 stolen bases in 5 attempts, and 14 walks to 20 strikeouts, his season ending early in mid-August for undisclosed reasons.\n\nThe Reds had the Curacaoan begin the 2023 season in the Arizona Complex League but he demonstrated that his 2022 season was no fluke by going 11-26 in his first 9 games with 4 extra base hits and 5 walks to just 4 strikeouts, leading to a promotion to the Single-A Daytona Tortugas. The 19-year-old appeared in 24 games with the Tortugas from the beginning of July on and hit .213/.339/.319 with 2 doubles, 1 home run, 1 stolen base, and 7 walks to 14 strikeouts. Following the conclusion of the season, during the 2023 winter meetings, he was selected by the Mets in the minor league portion of the 2023 Rule 5 Draft.\n\nThe 5’8”, 180-pound Antonia stands extremely open at the plate, holding his hands high over his head and angling his bat head at 2:00. He closes up and swings with a toe tap timing mechanism without much of a load or weight transfer. He can put a jolt into the ball when hit squarely, and the 20-year-old has progressively improved his ability to make solid contact, lift, and drive the ball, although he struggled adapting when promoted to Low-A this past season.\n\nAlthough signed as a catcher by the Reds and currently listed as a catcher by the Mets, Donovan Antonia has never actually played a single game at the position. The Reds had him playing the infield during the Dominican Instructional League when he first signed with them and he has appeared in games at first base, second base, and all three outfield positions. Antonia is athletic and well proportioned, possessing average speed and an above-average arm.\n\nJuan Arnaud, RHP\n\nJuan Arnaud was signed on January 15, the first day of the 2021 international signing period, out of Cotui, a city in the Dominican Republic that also produced such major leaguers as Duaner Sanchez, Teoscar Hernandez, and Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Jose Capellan. Set to begin his professional career later that summer, Arnaud missed the entire season due to an injury. He was finally able to get back on the field in June 2022 and spent the summer pitching for both Mets Dominican Summer League squadrons. In 30.2 innings with the DSL Mets 1 and DSL Mets 2 combined, the right-hander posted a 5.87 ERA with 33 hits allowed, 30 walks, and 34 strikeouts. In 2023, he was sent stateside, assigned to the FCL Mets. The 20-year-old appeared in 15 games for them and posted a 4.71 ERA in 21.0 innings, allowing 12 hits, walking 18, and striking out 22.\n\nThe right-hander throws from a three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action through the back. His fastball sits in the high-80s-to-low-90s, generally 88-91, occasionally touching 92, 93 MPH. He complement it with a mid-70s curveball that has solid 12-6 shape, and possibly a mid-70s changeup as well. When Arnaud was signed, he had the reputation as being a strike thrower, but he struggled hitting the zone in his first year on the mound against professional hitters with professional umpiring crews. Arnaud works very quickly and has some jerkiness in his delivery; slowing down and smoothing out his mechanics would certainly help his command.\n\nEnderson Asencio, OF\n\nEnderson Asencio was born on 3/17/2006 in Moca, a city in northern Dominican Republic known as “the village of heroes” due to the many men and women from the city who played a role in opposing dictators Ulises Heureaux and Rafael Trujillo. He signed with the Mets on January 15, 2023, with the two sides agreeing to a $75,000 signing bonus. The Mets assigned him to the Dominican Summer League, where he played 50 games for the DSL Mets Orange. The 17-year-old hit .210/.343/.347 with 11 doubles, 4 home runs, 2 stolen bases in 3 attempts, and drew 26 walks to 55 strikeouts.\n\nAsencio is a big kid, standing 6’4” and weighing 195-pounds. He has a big swing, hinting at future above-average in-game power but swing that comes at the expense of his ability to make contact, and it prompts a large number of swings and misses. In 2023, he registered numerous exit velocities over 95 MPH and even a handful of 100 MPH exit velocities, but his launch angles were all over the place.\n\nDespite his size, Asencio runs well. The majority of his innings came in left field in 2023, but he also played considerable time in right field and a bit at first base. While he undoubtedly will fill in and get a little slower as he ages, it is unlikely that he be forced out of the outfield completely. With his above-average arm, he should profile in right field for years to come.\n\nJavier Atencio, LHP\n\nJavier Atencio was signed by the Mets on July 2, 2018, the first day of the 2018-2019 international signing period, out of Ocumare del Tuy, Venezuela for a $75,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut the following summer, assigned to the DSL Mets. The 17-year-old appeared in 12 games for them and posted a 4.75 ERA, allowing 42 hits, walking 16, and striking out 25. After missing the 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Atencio remained in the Dominican Summer League in 2021 due to many of the travel restrictions in place at the time. He appeared in 15 games for the DSL Mets and posted a 2.44 ERA in 48.0 innings, allowing 28 hits, walking 19, and striking out 76.\n\nThe Mets brought him stateside in 2022, assigning him to the St. Lucie Mets after impressing in extended spring training, a somewhat aggressive assignment for a 20-year-old whose only professional experience was in the DSL. Atencio more than held his own, posting a 2.27 ERA in 39.2 innings sandwiched between an injury that cost him a few weeks at the end of July and beginning of August, allowing 30 hits, walking 23, and striking out 48. The southpaw remained in St. Lucie for the 2023 season, but he struggled in his sophomore season there, getting sent back down to the FCL Mets for about a month in an attempt to get his season back on track. All in all, Atencio posted a 10.40 ERA in 40.2 innings before his season ended prematurely in August due to an undisclosed injury. He allowed 58 total hits, walked 33, struck out 37, and allowed at least one earned run in every single one of his 13 appearances.\n\nThe southpaw throws from a slingy high-three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action through the back. He hides the ball well with a big leg kick and incorporates an exaggerated glove tap mid-windup to further deceive hitters. He has simple, repeatable mechanics, though he sometimes rushes in the stretch. He works better throwing north-south than east-west, as he is still learning to command his secondary pitches.\n\nAtencio primarily relies on a four-seam fastball with some natural sinking action. It averaged 91 MPH in 2023, sitting in the high-80s-to-low-90s. He pairs his fastball with a curveball and a changeup, both effective pitches in inducing groundballs. His curve sits in the mid-to-high-70s, averaging 77 MPH with big sweepy break. His changeup sits in the mid-70s-to-mid-80s, averaging 83 MPH. Atencio throws two versions of it, a split-change and a more traditional changeup, his split-change generally sitting at the higher velocity bend and showing higher spin rates approaching 2600 RPM, while his more traditional change sits at the lower end of his velocity band, showing spin rates that dip as low as 1100 RPM. The left-hander relies primarily on his fastball-changeup combo, sometimes throwing his changeup just as much as his fastball. He uses his curveball enough for it to be a bone fide part of his arsenal, but at times, he literally only throws it once or twice an outing.\n\nJesus Baez, INF\n\nSixteen-year-old Jesus Baez was signed out of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on January 15, 2022, the first day of the 2022 international signing period, signing for $275,000. He turned 17 a few weeks later and was assigned to the Dominican Summer League a few months later. Suiting up for both of the Mets’ DSL squads, the infielder appeared in 54 games over the summer, hitting .242/.341/.403 with 9 doubles, 7 home runs, 8 stolen bases in 14 attempts, and 26 walks to 46 strikeouts. He gained a large amount of helium that winter, leading to his being ranked 20 on the Amazin’ Avenue Top 25 Mets Prospects for 2023 list, but he unfortunately did not really live up to expectations. Sent stateside to the FCL Mets, Baez hit .210/.306/.333 with 9 doubles, 1 triple, 2 home runs, 5 stolen bases in 7 attempts, and drew 19 walks to 28 strikeouts.\n\nJesus Baez doesn’t look like the kind of player who has massive raw power, but his big right-handed swing gets the most of his 5’10”, 180-pound frame. He stands slightly open at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head. Using a big leg kick, he has a big swing that has registered exit velocities over 100 MPH. The bat speed seems average at best and the swing is long, and he has had trouble catching up with mid-90s velocity, but he can punish pitches that he is able to make good contact on. He is very aggressive at the plate, and improving his approach would go a long way to making better contact on more hittable pitches.\n\nDefensively, Baez’s arm is well above-average, borderline plus. It gives him the ability to play shortstop despite possessing only average range for a middle infielder and so-so defensive actions and instincts. Should he eventually be moved off of shortstop, his arm would fit at third base. He added weight and size as the 2023 season went on, but it did not impact his ability to play the position.\n\nBrett Banks, RHP\n\nA North Carolina native, Brett Banks grew up in Garner, attending Garner High School, where he lettered three years and hit a cumulative .245/.317/.333 with 10 doubles, 1 home run, 1 stolen base, and 13 walks to 42 strikeouts. He was a bit more proficient on the mound, posting a 5.08 ERA in 104.2 innings, allowing 111 hits, walking 81, and striking out 118. The right-hander had a fastball that touched the low-90s and developing breaking balls, but still needed a lot more work to become a viable professional, so he went undrafted after graduating. He attended Wake Tech in 2020, a community college in Raleigh, North Carolina, but did not pitch due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He transferred to Catawba Valley Community College in Hickory, North Carolina in 2021 and got on the mound finally as a collegiate athlete, appearing in 8 games and posting a 0.50 ERA in 18.0 innings with 6 hits allowed, 6 walks, and 18 strikeouts. He went undrafted in the 2021 MLB Draft and pitched for the Johnson City Doughboys that summer in the newly-reformed Appalachian League, posting a 3.71 ERA in 17.0 innings over 8 games, with 15 hits allowed, 13 walks, and 19 strikeouts.\n\nThe right-hander transferred to UNC Wilmington for 2022, his red-shirt sophomore season. Banks struggled, appearing in 11 games and posting a 7.63 ERA in 30.2 innings, allowing 37 hits, walking 24, and striking out 35. Head Coach Randy Hood and Pitching Coach Kelly Secrest gave the right-hander some role clarity in 2023, using him only out of the bullpen in late innings, and Banks flourished. Appearing in 30 games, taking over the role of closer later in the season, he posted a 4.23 ERA in 38.1 innings, allowing 31 hits, walking 21, and striking out 44.\n\nPrior to the draft, Banks entered the transfer portal and committed to North Carolina State University, with the intention of transferring there if he was not selected as a high-round draft pick in the 2023 MLB Draft. He was selected by the Mets in the 11th round of the draft and agreed to a $200,000 signing bonus, $50,000 over the post-tenth-round maximum in which the Mets would have to dip into the bonus pool. He was assigned to the FCL Mets and appeared in three games in August, giving up an earned run in 2.1 innings, walking two and striking out three while not allowing a hit.\n\nBanks throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a whippy arm. His fastball is an above-average pitch both by pure velocity and advanced pitch metrics. It sits in the mid-90s, topping out at 98 MPH, and features a high spin rate, giving the pitch as much as 20 inches of induced vertical break. He complements it with a low-to-mid-80s slider that features short, sharp break and in the future may be able to develop a bona fide cutter out of the pitch as well. The right-hander has had command problems throughout his high school and college career but is able to keep the ball close enough near the zone to entice batters.\n\nAnthony Baptist, OF\n\nA native of Barahona, Dominican Republic, a coastal city on the island’s southwestern that was also the birthplace of former professionals Julio Lugo, Ruddy Lugo, and Edinson Volquez, the Mets officially signed outfielder Anthony Baptist on January 15, 2023, the first day of the 2023 international free agent signing period. Signed for a $1.1 million signing bonus, representing roughly 20% of their $5.2 million budget. He was assigned to the Dominican Summer League for the 2023 season and appeared in 32 games for the DSL Mets Orange. The 17-year-old hit .276/.427/.476 with 3 doubles, 6 triples, 2 home runs, 12 stolen bases in 18 attempts, and drew 25 walks to 29 strikeouts.\n\nThe left-hander stands open at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head. He swings with a slight toe tap mechanism, but will almost certainly have his swing reworked as he spends more time within the organization, as his swing is virtually all upper body, barely utilizing his lower half. His small frame limits his physical power projection, but his contact-over-power profile allows him to make the most of his carrying tool, his speed- the infielder has been clocked multiple times at 6.1 seconds in the 60-yard dash, meaning he has plus-plus speed. His offensive game is centered around spraying line drives around the field, putting the ball in play, and wreaking havoc on the base path. It is imperative for him to lift the ball more in the future. He only had a handful of launch angles above 10 degrees in the entire 2023 season, as his 61.6% ground ball rate attests to.\n\nDefensively, Baptist profiles well in center field thanks to the range he has afforded by his foot speed. At this stage in his professional development, he needs to improve his read of the ball off the bat and his routes, refinements that come with repetition and experience. He has an above-average arm, so in the unlikely situation that he just does not take to center or loses the necessary speed and range to remain there, right field remains a potential future home. While Baptist has plenty of room to add muscle mass to his frame, as he is listed at 5’11”, 155-pounds, it is unlikely that he grows to the point where he is forced off of the position as his frame is slim and lithe.\n\nJack Beck, RHP\n\nThe son of Lynn Beck, a standout receiver at Oklahoma State, Jace Beck did not inherit his father’s football skills, but he did inherit his genetics and propensity for athletics. After first learning to pitch in the seventh grade, Jace continued playing through high school, excelling on the diamond instead of the gridiron. He was particularly impressive in his junior year, when he went 9-2 for the Tuttle Tigers, posting a 1.47 ERA in 70 innings with 20 walks and 90 strikeouts. In the middle of his senior year, he moved, and transferred schools, going from Tuttle High School to their rival, Blanchard High School. Though he wore a different uniform, going from the Tuttle Tigers to the Blanchard Lions, Beck continued to be dominant on the mound. The entire team was, in fact, going 39-0 for the year. Beck himself went a perfect 13-0, posting a 0.99 ERA in 70.2 innings, striking out 134. The Mets selected the right-hander in the 22nd round of the 2019 MLB Draft, the 658th player selected overall. He forwent his commitment to Cowley County Community College and signed with the Mets for a $125,000 bonus. The 19-year-old appeared in 6 games in 2019, posting a 3.38 ERA in 8.0 innings for the GCL Mets, allowing 7 hits, walking 1, and striking out 10.\n\nAfter missing the 2020 season, he returned to the St. Lucie complex, now the FCL Mets. Appearing in 10 games and starting 6, he posted a 6.65 ERA in 21.2 innings, allowing 18 hits, walking 19, and striking out 31. He earned a promotion to the St. Lucie Mets at the end of the year, pitching exactly one inning for them, and then pitched the majority of the 2022 season with them. Appearing in 17 games in 2022, the right-hander posted a 2.37 ERA in 19.0 innings, with 11 hits allowed, 17 walks, and 22 strikeouts. In 2023, the 23-year-old was promoted to High-A Brooklyn and pitched there for the entire year. Appearing in 26 games, he posted a 3.73 ERA in 31.1 innings, allowing 25 hits, walking 30, and striking out 57.\n\nBeck is filled-in and physically mature. At 6’9”, Jace Beck is extremely tall, even for a professional athlete. Being tall comes with certain advantages and disadvantages as a pitcher, and the right-hander exhibits both. He pushes off the mound well and has great extension due to his long wingspan, but often has trouble commanding his pitches, even though he generally groups his release points together fairly well.\n\nThe big right-hander throws from a high three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action though the back incorporating a wrist wrap. His fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s, averaging 93 MPH and topping out at 97 MPH. The pitch has an average spin rate and has a bit of sink to it. Earlier in his career, the pitch induced more ground balls, but in 2023, that rate precipitously dropped.\n\nBack when Beck was a prep pitcher, he almost exclusively relied on his fastball to dominate his competition and as such, his curveball and changeup were even further behind in their development than other high school pitchers on draft day and remain very rough offerings. Given that the majority of his outings as a professional have been single-inning relief appearances, the amount of breaking balls thrown in many of his outings can literally be counted on one hand. In his arsenal are changeups, sliders, cutters, and curveballs, all of varying degrees of development and effectiveness. To date, his slider has been his most effective breaking ball, eliciting more swings-and-misses and resulting in fewer balls put in play with hard contact. Sitting in the low-80s, averaging 83 MPH, the pitch does not have much bite to it and has curveball characteristics.\n\nGage Bihm, LHP\n\nSouthpaw Gage Bihm is a Louisiana native, born in Opelousas, one of the oldest cities in the state. He attended Opelousas Catholic High School and went on to attend Hinds Community College after graduating in 2020. In his freshman year, Bihm appeared in 10 games for the Hinds Bulldogs, starting 4, and posted a 6.28 ERA in 14.1 innings, allowing 10 hits, walking 17, and striking out 19. That summer, he played for the Baton Rouge Rougarou in the Texas Collegiate League and posted a 6.00 ERA in 23.0 innings over 15 games, with 23 hits allowed, 24 walks, and 30 strikeouts. He returned to Hinds for his sophomore season and had a similar season, albeit with a heavier workload. Bihm appeared in 14 games, starting 6, and posted a 6.35 ERA in 45.1 innings, allowing 44 hits, walking 45, and striking out 56. He returned to Baton Rouge for a second summer and appeared in 5 games, starting 4, posting a 5.40 ERA in 18.1 innings, with 7 hits allowed, 21 walks, and 14 strikeouts.\n\nEligible to be selected in the 2022 MLB Draft as a sophomore from a junior college, Bihm was not selected by a Major League Baseball club. The left-hander transferred to LSU-Shreveport, where he finally seemed to put everything together. He appeared in 25 games for the Pilots and posted a 1.80 ERA in 40.0 innings, allowing 18 hits, walking 19, and striking out 59. He once again went undrafted after the season ended and was planning on transferring to the University of Oklahoma but only hours after receiving the scholarship offer, received a professional contract from the Mets, who had watched his professional workouts after the college season ended and liked what they saw. The southpaw weighed the pros and cons of both offers and decided to sign with the Mets in July. He did not suit up for them over the course of the rest of the summer.\n\nThe 6’4”, 215-pound left-hander throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot. His fastball sits in the mid-90s and he complements the pitch with a high spin rate curveball. The southpaw has consistently had problems with his control and command but was able to improve in 2023 on the strength of better coaching.\n\nKellum Clark, OF\n\nKellum Clark’s father played baseball at Belhaven University, private Division III evangelical Christian university in Jackson, Mississippi, and the apple did not fall far from the tree, as Kellum grew up playing as well. He initially attended high school at Jackson Academy, a private school in Jackson, Mississippi, but transferred to Brandon High School in his native Brandon, Mississippi as an upperclassman. Considered a big-time follow by scouts and evaluators thanks to a strong arm and a loud bat, Clark had a strong commitment to Mississippi State University, a school that his grandfather, two aunts, and an uncle attended, and went undrafted in the 2020 MLB Draft, going on to attend college instead.\n\nAn older freshman, turning 20 during the year, Clark had a solid season, appearing in 33 games and starting 26 in the outfield and at first base. He hit .237/.355/.495 with 7 doubles, 1 triple, 5 home runs, 1 stolen base, and 14 walks to 29 strikeouts. He played for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League that summer and played in 21 games for them, hitting .191/.320/.238 with 3 doubles, 3 stolen bases, and 8 walks to 26 strikeouts. He returned to the Bulldogs for the 2022 season and appeared in 55 games, starting 52 as the team’s primary right fielder. Clark was one of the better hitters on the team, hitting .257/.369/.556 with 12 doubles, 1 triple, 14 home runs, 2 stolen bases, and 26 walks to 47 strikeouts. He returned to Wareham that summer for a second stint in the Cape and hit an improved .264/.393/.333 with 5 doubles, 2 stolen bases, and 10 walks to 20 strikeouts. The 22-year-old had a career year this past spring, appearing in 52 games for MSU and hitting .300/.395/.546 with 11 doubles, 1 triple, 11 home runs, 6 stolen bases, and 28 walks to 49 strikeouts.\n\nThe Mets selected Clark with their last selection in the 2023 MLB Draft, the 606th player selected in the draft overall out of 614 total. The two sides agreed to a $150,000 signing bonus, the highest allowable by Major League Baseball for players selected after the 10th round before the monetary value would count against the team’s slot bonus pool. He was assigned to the FCL Mets at the end of July and played in 11 games with them before being promoted to the St. Lucie Mets in late August, where he played in 11 more games before the season ended. All in all, with the FCL Mets and St. Lucie Mets, Clark hit a combined .262/.425/.369 with 2 doubles, 1 triple, 1 home run, 3 stolen bases in as many attempts, and 18 walks to 21 strikeouts.\n\nA left-handed batter, Clark stands square at the plate, holding his hands high and his bat angled at 10:30. He swings with a slight leg lift and has a long-levered swing that produces easy power to all fields, regularly recording exit velocities in the 90s and occasionally reaching triple digits as well while playing college baseball. So far in his young professional career, the outfielder has had scattershot measured exit velocities and results. Averaging an 82.7 MPH exit velocity in all batted ball events while playing with St. Lucie, he has almost as many balls put in play with exit velocities less than 70 MPH as he does with balls put in play with exit velocities over 95 MPH. While the left-hander has a solid understanding of the strike zone and works counts, he struggled against elevated fastballs and spin with MSU and so far as a professional has struggled against breaking balls, going after them with an above-average likelihood to swing and miss.\n\nIn the outfield, his defense is limited to a corner spot, with enough arm strength to play right field. A fringe-average runner currently, he does not have explosive speed, but shows solid range in for a corner once he gets going. Clark also has experience playing first base, where he has demonstrated good footwork, soft hands, and the ability to pick balls in the dirt.\n\nNolan Clenney, RHP\n\nBorn in Northville, Michigan, Nolan Clenney attended Detroit Catholic Central High School in nearby Novi, where he established himself as one of the best players on the Shamrocks and an intriguing follow for scouts and evaluators in Michigan. The right-hander graduated undrafted in 2014 and attended Brunswick Community College in Supply, North Carolina, a small unincorporated community on the state’s southern Atlantic coastline. Clenney excelled as a hitter and a pitcher with the Dolphins, posting a cumulative 2.53 ERA in 81.2 innings with 62 hits allowed, 31 walks, and 88 strikeouts along with a cumulative .396/.439/.538 batting line in 73 games with 4 home runs, 3 stolen bases, and 19 walks to 18 strikeouts. After his sophomore season, he transferred to North Carolina State, redshirting in his first year there. In 2018, Clenney led the Wolfpack with 33 appearances out of the bullpen and posted a 3.43 ERA in 44.2 innings, allowing 32 hits, walking 26, and striking out 54. In 2019, his redshirt senior season, the 23-year-old was limited to just 14 games and posted a 2.25 ERA in 12.0 innings with 9 hits allowed, 9 walks, and 13 strikeouts.\n\nHis limited time on the mound combined with his advanced age led the right-hander to go undrafted in the 2019 MLB Draft. Rather than give up on baseball, Clenney signed with the Utica Unicorns of the United Shore Professional Baseball League, an independent league in the Detroit metropolitan area. He pitched with them for two years- the USPBL played in the summer of 2020- and compiled a cumulative 3.01 ERA in 68.2 innings with 55 hits allowed, 21 walks, and 76 strikeouts, helping lead the Unicorns to back-to-back championships. In 2021, the 25-year-old signed with the Gary SouthShore RailCats of the American Association. Pitching mainly out of their bullpen, he posted a 0.89 ERA in 20.1 innings over 11 games, allowing 12 hits, walking 3, and striking out 26. At the beginning of May 2021, Clenney agreed, in principle, to a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers but the deal fell through, leading the Mets to sign the right-hander roughly a month later, at the end of June.\n\nThe Mets assigned Clenney to St. Lucie for the majority of 2021, receiving a late-season promotion to Brooklyn in September. All in all, in his first professional season, the right-hander posted a 3.90 ERA in 27.2 innings over 17 relief appearances, allowing 25 hits, walking 7, and striking out 37. He remained in Brooklyn to start 2022 and remained there for the entire year, posting a 4.92 ERA in 67.2 innings over 33 appearances with 60 hits allowed, 22 walks allowed, and 87 strikeouts. Clenney initially started the 2023 season with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, but was promoted to the Syracuse Mets after a few games, and then sent back down to Binghamton after a few games with them. This occurred multiple times over the course of the season, and though he spent the majority of the year with Binghamton, he also threw considerable innings with Syracuse as well. With the Rumble Ponies, the right-hander posted a 5.36 ERA in 40.1 innings, allowing 48 hits, walking 18, and striking out 44, and with the Syracuse Mets, he posted a 6.08 ERA in 23.2 innings, allowing 21 hits, walking 11, and striking out 37. After the season ended, the Mets sent Clenney to the Arizona Fall League, and the reliever posted solid numbers. Appearing in 9 games, he had a 1.00 ERA in 9.0 innings, allowing 7 hits, walking 4, and striking out 15.\n\nThe 6’2”, 215-pound right-hander throws from a low-three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action through the back. He gets good extension off of the mound and folds his top half over well, lowering his release point and giving him a flatter vertical approach angle. His fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s and features spin rates that flash above-average. The pitch has good sink and arm side run, resulting in good groundball rates and a large number of weak infield flyballs. He complements the pitch with a slider that sits in the low-to-mid-80s and the occasional low-to-mid-80s changeup. His slider is his main strikeout pitch, featuring tight, gyroscopic 12-6 break, while his changeup has natural tumble and fade, eliciting swings-and-misses as well as strikeouts.\n\nRobert Colina, RHP\n\nRobert Colina was born in Punto Fijo, the largest city in the Venezuelan state of Falcón. Inspired by hometown heroes Freddy Galvis and Robinson Chirinos, he sought to become a professional ballplayer himself. While in school, his parents and coaches discovered that he had an incredible arm, and Colina he began training with a variety of people, eventually enrolling at Future Stars Baseball Academy in Barquisimito. He eventually signed with the Mets on July 2, 2017, agreeing to a $85,000 signing bonus.\n\nThe right-hander was assigned to the Dominican Summer League and posted a 2.94 ERA in 49.0 innings, allowing 42 hit, walking 12, and striking out 49. He began the 2019 season in the DSL but was promoted to the GCL Mets in late June after just four starts. Pitching as both a starter and reliever, Colina posted a 3.57 ERA in 40.1 innings, allowing 42 hits, walking 13, and striking out 35. He was sent stateside in 2021, starting the year with the FCL Mets, but was promoted to the St. Lucie Mets in mid-August and finished out the season with them. In the complex, the right-hander posted a 2.70 ERA in 23.1 innings with 21 hits allowed, 6 walks, and 32 strikeouts, while he posted a 3.18 ERA in 28.1 innings with 27 hits allowed, 12 walks, and 27 strikeouts, giving him a combined 2.96 ERA in 51.2 innings with 48 hits allowed, 18 walks, and 59 strikeouts. The 21-year-old spent the season with St. Lucie and the FCL Mets once again in 2022, though this time in reverse order, as he struggled and was demoted midway through the season. In St. Lucie, he posted a 7.99 ERA in 32.2 innings, allowing 42 hits, walking 17, and striking out 41, while he posted a 1.59 ERA in 17.0 innings with 11 hits allowed, 3 walks, and 22 strikeouts in the complex, giving him a combined 5.80 ERA in 49.2 innings on the year with 53 hits allowed, 17 walks, and 63 strikeouts.\n\nColina started the 2023 season out with the St. Lucie Mets and pitched one game there before being promoted to Binghamton, where he also pitched exactly one game. The right-hander spent the majority of the season with the Brooklyn Cyclones, an injury in September ended his season prematurely. All in all, Colina was excellent, appearing in 19 games and starting 8. He posted a 3.84 ERA in 61.0 innings, allowing 62 hits, walking 16, and striking out 75.\n\nThe right-hander throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a long action through the back. His mechanics are sound and do not show red flags in relation to either injury or control. Listed at 5’11”, Colina is short for a pitcher, and his 175-pound frame is already well filled in and proportionate, making additional growth at this point unlikely.\n\nColina’s fastball averages 92 MPH, ranging from 89 to 93 MPH. The pitch averages a slightly above average spin rate and displays positive spin axis traits but the pitch does not register many swings and misses, with batters able to square up on it. Instead, his curveball is his main strikeout pitch, an offering that logged more whiffs over his career than his fastball. The pitch sits between 75 and 80 MPH and features a bit of horizontal movement and a ton of vertical drop. While he is mainly a two-pitch, fastball-curveball pitcher, he occasionally mixes in a cutter and changeup.\n\nJeffrey Colon, RHP\n\nJeffrey Colon was born in Las Matas de Farfan, Dominican Republic, a town not far from the Haitian border that was the birthplace of numerous current and former major leaguers, including Jean Segura, Juan Encarnación, Roberto Novoa, Odalis Perez, Ramón Santiago, and Valerio De Los Santos. Colon was signed by the Mets on June 2, 2018, at the very end of the 2018-2019 international signing period and spent the entire season in the Dominican Summer League. The 18-year-old appeared in 15 games and pitched a total of 34.0 innings, posting a 4.24 ERA with 30 hits allowed, 16 walks, and 33 strikeouts. He was sent stateside in 2019, pitching for the GCL Mets, and had a similar season in the complex; appearing in 19 games, he posted a 4.94 ERA in 27.1 innings pitched, allowing 28 hits, walking 17, and striking out 22.\n\nAfter missing 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Colon split the year with the FCL Mets and the St. Lucie Mets, pitching 18.2 innings for both teams to varying results. With the FCL Mets, he appeared in 9 games and posted a 1.93 ERA, allowing 14 hits, walking 3, and striking out 27. With the St. Lucie Mets, he appeared in 14 games and posted a 6.27 ERA, allowing 28 hits, walking 11, and striking out 17. He began the 2022 season with St. Lucie and had a much better go at it this season. The 22-year-old appeared in 13 games and posted a 3.23 ERA in 47.1 innings, allowing 41 hits, walking 11, and striking out 57. He was promoted to High-A Brooklyn in mid-August and was extremely effective in the 6 outings he had in Coney Island. Throwing 25.1 innings, the right-hander posted a 1.07 ERA with 13 hits allowed, 7 walks, and 27 strikeouts. All in all, at both levels combined, Colon posted a 2.48 ERA in 72.2 innings, allowing 54 hits, walking 18, and striking out 84. He spent the entire 2023 season with the Brooklyn Cyclones, missing roughly all of July and August due to an injury. The 23-year-old had a fairly erratic season, posting a 5.72 ERA in 61.1 innings, allowing 75 hits, walking 22, and striking out 54.\n\nThe right-hander throws from a low-three-quarters arm slot, with a long arm action through the back and minimal unnecessary movement. Colon is mainly a fastball/changeup pitcher. He pitches backwards, using his changeup roughly 50% of the time, and complementing it with his fastball.\n\nColon’s fastball sits in the high-80s-to-low-90s and has slight armside run to go along with some natural sink. The right-hander maintained a 52.0% groundball rate in 2023 and a strong 61.5% groundball rate in 2022 on the strength of the sink of his fastball and the weak contact from his changeup. He throws two different versions of his changeup. One is thrown a bit harder, hovering around 90 MPH, and features more horizontal movement than vertical drop, and the other is thrown a bit slower, sitting in the mid-80s, and features more vertical drop than horizontal movement.\n\nJoshua Cornielly, RHP\n\nSigned on the first day of the 2018-2019 international free agent signing period out of Caracas, Venezuela’s Elite Baseball Academy, Joshua Corneilly made his professional debut that summer, assigned to the Dominican Summer League. The 17-year-old right-hander posted a 3.25 ERA in 27.2 innings, allowing 35 hits, walking 8, and striking out 27. He began the 2019 season with the DSL Mets, posting a 6.10 ERA in three starts, but was promoted to the GSL Mets and sent stateside in late June. Pitching as a swingman there, he posted a 4.54 ERA in 35.2 innings, allowing 43 hits, walking 8, and striking out 40.\n\nHe missed all of 2020 due to the coronavirus and then missed all of 2021 thanks to a shoulder surgery in the spring and then difficulties securing a visa. He finally got back on the mound in 2022, assigned to the St. Lucie Mets. Appearing in 31 games, the 21-year-old posted a 5.21 ERA in 46.2 innings, with 48 hits allowed, 25 walks, and 53 strikeouts. In 2023, he spent the entire season with the Brooklyn Cyclones and posted a 3.71 ERA in 51.0 innings, allowing 48 hits, walking 17, and striking out 58.\n\nThe bespectacled right-hander throws from a three-quarters arm slot, dropping down low with a long arm action in the back. His delivery is simple, repeatable, and mechanically sound, leading to no red flags regarding injury or control problems. The right-hander does not have a particularly flashy arsenal, but is a cerebral pitcher and is able to maximize his repertoire based on what is working best for him on any given night and how batters are reacting.\n\nEarlier in his career, his fastball sits in the low-90s, topping out a little higher and occasionally dipping into the high-80s. His main secondary pitch is a low-80s changeup, which features roughly a 10 MPH differential from his fastball with tumble and fade. While the pitch did not elicit many more swings and misses as compared to his fastball, the pitch does induce weak contact. In addition, he throws a curveball that sits in the mid-to-high-70s and a slider that sits around 80 MPH.\n\nCarlos Cortes, OF\n\nCarlos Cortes had a long track record of hitting in high school, both on the showcase circuit and for Lake Howell High School in Winter Park, Florida, and having done their due diligence on the youngster, the Mets drafted him with their 20th round selection in the 2016 MLB Draft. Having already committed to South Carolina University, Cortes elected to attend college instead of turning pro. In 50 games as a freshman, Cortes hit .286/.368/.565 with 12 home run, 5 stolen bases in 7 attempts, and 22 walks to 27 strikeouts. He played in the Cape Cod Collegiate League that summer and returned to South Carolina to hit .265/.385/.500 in his second year, slugging 15 home runs, stealing 8 bases in 9 attempts, and walking 43 times to 32 strikeouts. The Mets remained interested in the draft-eligible sophomore and picked him once again, this time selecting him in the 3rd round of the 2018 MLB Draft. This time around, he signed with the club, agreeing to a $1,000,038 signing bonus, roughly $300,000 over the MLB-recommended slot value. He made his professional debut with the Brooklyn Cyclones and posted a .264/.338/.382 batting line in 47 games, hitting 4 homers, walking 17 times and striking out 34. He was promoted to St. Lucie in 2019 and hit .255/.336/.397 in 127 games, hitting 11 homers, stealing 6 bases in 11 attempts, and walking 52 times to 77 strikeouts.\n\nLike everybody else, he missed the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic but was able to get into some competitive baseball action late in the year in the Australian Baseball League. Appearing in 14 games for the Sydney Blue Sox, a team particularly hurt by COVID protocols, Cortes hit .392/.429/.706. Returning to the U.S. and playing for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, Cortes was able to keep the momentum going early in the 2021 season but the gains faded as the year progressed. In the first two months of the season, he hit .287/.353/.551 with 9 home runs and 20 walks to 45 strikeouts, but in the last two months, he hit .236/.314/.423 with 5 home runs and a 14:37 walk:strikeout ratio, good for a .257/.332/.487 batting line in 79 games with 14 home runs, 35 walks, and 85 strikeouts. His struggles continued into 2022, as the 25-year-old hit a combined .223/.295/.369 with 12 home runs, 42 walks, and 124 strikeouts in 123 games with Binghamton and Syracuse. His 2023 season was only a slight improvement, as he hit .241/.355/.428 with 15 home runs in the highly offensively charged environment of Syracuse.\n\nCortes stands open at the plate an uppercutty swing, a stark difference from his earlier high school and collegiate days, when his bat path was much more level. His swing mechanics are fluid and Cortes swings at most pitches with intent. As such, there is some swing and miss in it, particularly against breaking balls out of the strike zone and versus left-handers. Pitches that he is able to make solid contact with jump off the bat despite his small stature; his load, coil, bat speed, barrel accuracy, and swing plane all magnify the power that you might expect from a guy that stands just 5’7”. He displays above-average raw power, but stagnation in his hit tool has limited his accessible raw during in-game situations.\n\nDefensively, Cortes does not have a true home. The 25-year-old is able to do a lot of things and play multiple positions, but he does not stand out at any. Naturally a left-hander, Cortes taught himself to throw with his right hand and is fully ambidextrous. When he is playing in the infield, he throws right-handed. When he plays the outfield, he throws left-handed. Because his arm strength is fringy from both sides and because he is a slightly below-average runner, he profiles better in the infield, at second base. Being an outfielder makes him a bit more valuable as a player, and as such, the Mets have primarily used him in the outfield since 2021.\n\nCandido Cuevas, RHP\n\nBarahona native Candido Cuevas was signed by the Mets on August 26, 2021, a late international signing. He was assigned to the Dominican Summer League in 2022 and appeared in 14 games, starting 7. In those 35.1 innings, he posted a 5.09 ERA, allowing 36 hits, walking 21, and striking out 42. Mets scouts and evaluators were high on Cuevas and he was sent stateside at the end of the season, appearing in three games for the FCL Mets. After once again impressing Mets brass during extended spring training, he began the 2023 season with the St. Lucie Mets in late May. The 19-year-old right-hander had a so-so showing for himself in the Florida State League, working around a pair of Injured List stints in late-June and another in mid-August that eventually ended his season completely. Appearing in 9 games, starting 5, Cuevas posted a 4.56 ERA in 23.2 innings, allowing 18 hits, walking 17, and striking out 33.\n\nThe right-hander was mainly two-pitch pitcher in 2023, throwing a fastball and curveball. His fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s, averaging 94 MPH. With above-average spin rates for a fastball, ranging 2350-2525 RPM and averaging 2450 RPM, the pitch generates a high number of swings-and-misses, and also elicits a lot of weak contact and groundballs, with a 54.1 groundball/put-in-play rate. His curveball sits in the low-80s with big 12-6 break and also induces lot of swings-and-misses and groundballs.\n\nYohairo Cuevas, OF/1B\n\nThe son of Dominican immigrants who came to the United States, Yohairo Cuevas grew up in Manhattan and the Bronx, attending All Hallows High School, a Catholic school in the South Bronx literally a few blocks from Yankee Stadium on East 164th street. Baseball came easy to him, as it is in his blood; his uncle, Juan Samuel, was a three-time all-star who played for the Mets in 1989 when he was acquired in the Lenny Dykstra trade. He moved to the Dominican Republic in order to expedite his ability to go pro and was signed by the Mets for $500,000 on January 15, 2021, the first day of the 2021 international signing period; he had an agreement with them and would have signed in July 2020 if the COVID-19 pandemic hadn’t necessitated the cancellation of the season and the delay of the international signing period.\n\nCuevas did not live up to expectations in his first season as a professional, assigned to the Dominican Summer League. Appearing in 41 games for the DSL Mets 1, the 17-year-old left-hander hit .155/.331/.214 with 0 home runs, 5 stolen bases in as many attempts, and 23 walks to 41 strikeouts. His 2022 season was a big improvement, as he hit .277/.374/.398 in 51 games for the DSL Mets with 2 home runs, 7 stolen bases in 10 attempts, and 27 walks to 43 strikeouts. He came stateside in 2023, initially assigned to the FCL Mets and then promoted to the St. Lucie Mets in late-July. In the Florida Complex League, the 19-year-old hit .310/.444/.578 in 23 games with 3 doubles, 2 triples, 4 home runs, 7 stolen bases in 8 attempts, and 18 walks to 21 strikeouts. In the Florida State League, Cuevas hit .215/.308/.354 in 23 games with 3 doubles, 1 triple, 2 home runs, 6 stolen bases in 7 attempts, and 9 walks to 24 strikeouts. All in all, the teenager hit a cumulative .260/.376/.460 in 46 total games, with 6 doubles, 3 triples, 6 home runs, 13 stolen bases in 15 attempts, and 27 walks to 45 strikeouts.\n\nThe 6’3”, 170-pound Cuevas is athletic and well-proportioned. At the plate, he stands slightly open, holding his hands high, swinging with a slight load and leg kick. His swing can get a bit long, resulting in strikeouts or weak contact resulting in ground balls, but when he makes solid contact, he can really put a jolt in the ball thanks to his natural strength and slightly above-average bat speed. During his time with St. Lucie in 2023, he averaged a 90.3 exit velocity on all recorded batted ball events, with multiple 100 MPH+ readings and a high-water mark of 107.6 MPH, a 436-foot home run off of Blue Jays organizational reliever Leam Mendez.\n\nUnlike his uncle, who literally coined the phrase, “You don’t walk off the island. You hit,” Cuevas has shown a solid eye at the plate, though this may be due to his background playing little league and travel ball in the U.S. as opposed to the sandlots of Quisqueya. He has also shown himself to be a solid base runner, stealing bases with an 87% success rate in 2023 and 83% for his career.\n\nDefensively, Cuevas is athletic, has above-average speed, and an above-average arm capable of reaching the mid-80s, making him an excellent fit in either center or right field. An outfielder by trade, Cuevas has experience playing first base in addition to playing in the outfield. Despite being listed as an outfielder by the Mets, he actually has more innings played at first base than he does in the outfield.\n\nFelipe De La Cruz, LHP\n\nBorn in Yamasa, a rural agricultural community in eastern Dominican Republic, southpaw Felipe De La Cruz was signed by the Mets on March 17, 2021, a few months before his 20th birthday. The left-hander was assigned to the Dominican Summer League and appeared in 14 games for the DSL Mets, starting 12 of them. He had a solid debut season, posting a 3.13 ERA in 46.0 innings with 38 hits allowed, 16 walks, and 46 strikeouts. The Mets sent him stateside in 2022, pitching with the FCL Mets for the majority of the season and receiving a cup-of-coffee with the St. Lucie Mets in September. In the Florida Complex League, De La Cruz posted a 4.83 ERA in 31.2 innings, allowing 32 hits, walking 16, and striking out 44. In his two games with St. Lucie, the southpaw did not allow a run in 4.0 innings, allowing a pair of hits, walking none, and striking out 9.\n\nThe 22-year-old began the 2023 season with St. Lucie and pitched there until the end of August, when he was promoted to the Brooklyn Cyclones. He appeared in 21 games for the St. Lucie Mets, starting 19, and posted a 4.68 ERA in 90.1 innings, allowing 92 hits, walking 41, and striking out 114. In his three starts with the Cyclones, he posted a 2.65 ERA in 17.0 innings, allowing 11 hits, walking 5, and striking out 17. With both teams combined, he posted a 4.36 ERA in 107.1 innings in 2023, allowing 103 hits, walking 46, and striking out 131, the fifth-most of any pitcher in the Mets minor league system.\n\nDe La Cruz throws from a high-three-quarters arm slot with a slingy arm action. Standing an even 6’, the left-hander weighs 160-pounds but is unlikely to add much more weight, as he is well-proportioned and athletic. He works better to his glove side against right-handed hitters and left-handed hitters alike, generally missing with almost everything to his arm side.\n\nHis fastball, a sinker, is well above-average for a left-handed pitcher, sitting in the mid-90s, ranging 92-96 MPH in 2023, averaging 94 MPH. The pitch features average spin rates for a fastball and occasionally flashes above-average spin rates, resulting in the large number of swings-and-misses that De La Cruz gets with the pitch and a high groundball rate. The southpaw complements his fastball with a slider and an occasional changeup. His slider sits in the low-to-mid-80s and features two-plane, slightly gyroscopic 12-6 movement. De La Cruz’ changeup sits in the mid-to-high-80s and generates a lot of weak contact and fly balls in addition to swings-and-misses.\n\nFrancis de Leon, OF\n\nSigned by the Mets on January 15, 2021, the start of the 2021-2022 international signing period out of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, outfielder Francis de Leon was assigned to the DSL Mets later that year, beginning his professional career in the Dominican Summer League. The 17-year-old played all three outfield positions, mainly playing right field, and hit .214/.395/.369 in 35 games with 3 home runs, 6 steals in 9 attempts, and 18 walks to 39 strikeouts. He was sent stateside in 2022 and assigned to the FCL Mets, with his playing time slowly tapering off as the year went on. He appeared in 18 games in total, hitting .109/.222/.109 with 0 home runs, 3 stolen bases in 4 attempts, and 4 walks to 23 strikeouts while mainly playing left field. In 2023, he remained in the FCL and appeared in 15 games, hitting .174/.345/.174 with 0 home runs, 7 stolen bases in 8 attempts, and 5 walks to 7 strikeouts.\n\nListed at 5’11”, 160-lbs, de Leon still has plenty of room to grow and add muscle but is already very physically mature for his age. The outfielder stands extremely open at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head. He swings without much of a load, using a moderate leg kick, whipping the bat through the zone and generating above-average raw power. His swing is still a bit raw, and his hit tool will need to improve in order to manifest his power in-game.\n\nDefensively, de Leon has speed, range, and an above-average arm, giving him the ability to play anywhere in the outfield presently. He has a chance to stay in center field in the long term future if he does not slow down and refines his read off the ball and his outfield routes. With his arm, he profiles well in right field.\n\nOmar De Los Santos, OF\n\nOmar De Los Santos was signed by the Mets in early February 2019, late in the 2019-2020 international signing period, an 18-year-old turning 19 during the season. He played in the Dominican Summer League that year, appearing for both Mets DSL teams and hitting a combined .274/.359/.416 with 4 home runs, 13 stolen bases, and 22 walks to 42 strikeouts. He missed the 2020 season due to the cancellation of the season due to COVID-19, but returned in 2021, assigned to the FCL Mets. He appeared in seven games with them, logging at least one hit in every single one, and was promoted to the St. Lucie Mets for the remainder of the season. De Los Santos did not enjoy the same success in the 38 games he played with them, hitting .241/.292/.331 in 38 games, but his first season stateside was a solid one, as he combined to hit .273/.318/.416 in 47 games with 3 home runs, 14 stolen bases, and 8 walks to 53 strikeouts.\n\nThe Mets assigned the 22-year-old to St. Lucie for a second consecutive season, and the outfielder had much more success this time around, though his season ended prematurely, as he hurt his hand sliding into second base in a game in early September. On the whole, the outfielder hit .272/.339/.459 with 16 home runs, a league-leading 70 stolen bases in 85 attempts, and 35 walks to 151 strikeouts. The Mets promoted the outfield to the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2023, but he regressed. Appearing in 98 total games for them, he hit .207/.261/.310 with 7 home runs, 37 stolen bases in 50 attempts, and a staggering 20 walks to 144 strikeouts.\n\nDe Los Santos stands square at the plate, holding his hands high. While he got on base at a strong rate in 2022, his hit tool is below average and is not expected to hold up particularly well at higher levels of the minor league ladder. His swing is long-levered and whippy, quick through the zone without much control. His 31.6% strikeout rate in 2022 was one of the highest in the entire system that year as was his 36% strikeout rate in 2023. The swing does generate some power, but at the higher levels, it really is unlikely to work.\n\nDe Los Santos’ carrying tool is his speed, evidenced by his 70 stolen bases in 2022 and his 37 in 2023. His total in 2022 was not only the most in the Florida State League on the year, but second to only Milwaukee Brewers farmhand Esteury Ruiz for the most in all of minor league baseball. De Los Santos has above-average, borderline plus speed, giving him the ability to steal plenty of bases, stretch singles, take extra bases, and cover plenty of ground in the outfield.\n\nBranny De Oleo, INF\n\nSanto Domingo native Branny De Oleo signed with the Mets for just $10,000 in January 2023. Assigned to the Dominican Summer League, the 18-year-old had an extremely successful debut season. Appearing in 46 games for the DSL Mets Blue, the right-hander hit .313/.403/.476 with 12 doubles, 3 triples, 3 home runs, 6 stolen bases in 7 attempts, and 14 walks to 18 strikeouts.\n\nDe Oleo is listed at 6’1”, 160-pounds, giving him plenty of room to grow and fill in. At the plate, the wiry infielder stands slightly open, wrapping his bat behind his head at 2:00 and swinging with a slight leg kick. He currently has below-average raw and in-game power but is still extremely projectable in that regard. He is an aggressive hitter and is able to make contact with most pitches thrown in the strike zone but his approach has also led to unnecessary strikeouts or poor contact with too many pitches outside of the zone.\n\nDefensively, De Oleo has the quick-twitch muscle necessary to play middle infield. At present, he is a reliable shortstop who is better at second base currently due to still-developing actions and arm strength.\n\nJoel Diaz, RHP\n\nSigned by the Mets on January 15, 2021, the first day of the 2021-2022 international free agent signing period, right-hander Joel Diaz had a phenomenal debut season. Assigned to Dominican Summer League, the 17-year-old posted a 0.54 ERA in 50.1 innings, allowing 29 hits, walking 9, and striking out 63. Since 2010, only Sixto Sanchez has posted a lower qualified ERA in his age-17 season, posting a 0.50 ERA in 54.0 innings with the GCL Phillies in 2016.\n\nThe young hurler gained a massive amount of helium that winter as a result, and the Mets seemed to have a second promising international free agent hurler in their ranks, with Robert Dominguez having impressed scouts and evaluators when he was signed roughly a year before. Diaz came stateside in 2022 and was assigned to the St. Lucie Mets in late May. Much like Dominguez’ results did not match the hype prior to his Tommy John surgery, the 18-year-old Diaz did not really have the best results in St. Lucie, posting a 5.86 ERA in 55.1 inning, allowing 62 hits, walking 25, and striking out 51.\n\nBased on his stuff and results, Amazin’ Avenue ranked Diaz the Mets’ 15 top prospect going into the 2023 season. The right-hander unfortunately did not pitch in 2023, undergoing Tommy John surgery just prior to the start of the season.\n\nDiaz throws from a three-quarters arm slot, short-arming the ball and really folding over and dropping when pushing off the mound, giving him a lower release point. He stands an even 6’ tall and weighs 210 pounds, giving him a solid frame for starting at the present with his thick trunk suggesting the possibility of further growth and/or more muscle mass in the future. The right-hander throws four pitches: a four-seam fastball, sinker, curveball, and changeup.\n\nPrior to his Tommy John surgery, his fastball ranged between 92-95 MPH, averaging 94 MPH in 2022. Though the 2200 RPM it averaged was not particularly high, the pitch had some ride up in the zone thanks to its flatter vertical approach angle, and batters had trouble squaring up on it. His sinker showed a bit more variance in its velocity, sitting 89-96 MPH and also averaging 94 MPH. The pitch averaged slightly above-average spin rates for a sinker and featured slightly above-average vertical and horizontal break as compared to the average MLB sinker in 2022.\n\nHis curveball ranged between 75-81 MPH, averaging 79 MPH. The pitch featured 11-5 shape and flashed above-average potential. His changeup sat in the mid-80s, averaging 86 MPH. The pitch featured a low spin rate, giving it good fade and tumble. In the DSL, he tended to rely on his fastball and changeup until the second time through the order, but with St. Lucie in 2022, his curveball was his primary secondary pitch, only throwing a handful of changeups per game. At times, he has struggled with his curveball command, and throwing it more frequently with St. Lucie, his walk rate ballooned as a result.\n\nRobert Dominguez, RHP\n\nBorn on November 30, 2001, Robert Dominguez was eligible to sign as an international free agent over the 2018-2019 international free agent signing period but flew under the radar and went unsigned as his stuff generally did not draw much attention from scouts and evaluators. The additional year of growth and development did wonders for the right-hander, as he grew, added more muscle to his frame, and added a few more miles per hour to his fastball. He received a handful of offers throughout the rest of the signing period, primarily in the low-five-figures territory, but turned them all down. Training in the Dominican Republic in the summer of 2019, he made mechanical changes to his delivery that unlocked some additional velocity in his. By the end of the summer, he had transformed his 93 MPH fastball into a pitch that flirted with triple digits.\n\nImpressed by the velocity, the Mets signed him shortly thereafter, making the right-hander a $95,000 offer in November 2019, just a few days before his 17th birthday. Dominguez would have started his professional career in the Dominican Summer League in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season delayed his debut. Instead, he was forced to wait until 2021, when the team assigned him to the FCL Mets, an aggressive assignment to be sure. Managing his workload extremely carefully, the right-hander appeared in 10 games and pitched a total of 12.0 innings, posting an 8.25 ERA with 15 hits allowed, 9 walks, and 10 strikeouts. The right-hander had Tommy John surgery just prior to the start of the 2022 season and as such missed the entire year. He began throwing in 2023, but ended up missing the entire 2023 season as well.\n\nAt 6’5”, 195-pounds, Dominguez has an ideal frame for pitching. The Venezuelan right-hander throws from a three-quarter arm slot, with a moderate leg lift and a long arm action through the back. He stays on top of the ball well and leverages his height well, throwing with downward plane. Prior to his surgery, his fastball sat in the low-to-mid-90s, with the right-hander reportedly possessing the ability to ramp the pitch up to 99 MPH. Complementing his impressive fastball was a slider and a developing changeup. The slider, which had been categorized as a curveball as an amateur, flashed being an average or better pitch thanks to its late break. The changeup, as is the case with most young pitches, lagged well behind the rest of his arsenal and was still far from being an effective pitch during in-game situations but shows promise because of its movement and velocity differential. He struggled throwing all three in 2021, but as a young player with very few innings under his belt, most scouts and evaluators believe his command will improve as he gains more professional experience.\n\nA.J. Ewing, INF\n\nA multi-sport athlete who also played football at Springboro High School, AJ Ewing really stood out on the diamond. In 2022, he earned All-Southwestern Ohio Conference honors with a .386 batting average and 4 home runs, and this past spring, he was named Great Western Ohio Conference Player of the Year after winning the triple crown, hitting .464 with 4 home runs and 37 RBI. He made the All-Conference First Team each year from 2021-2023 and was named to the Ohio Division I Second Team this past season.\n\nEwing had a commitment to the University of Alabama but was drafted by the Mets in the free agent compensation round, the 134th overall pick gained when Jacob deGrom signed with the Texas Rangers. The two sides agreed to a $675,000 signing bonus, roughly $200,000 above the MLB-assigned slot value of $483,000. The shortstop was assigned to the FCL Mets and appeared in 7 games, hitting .286/.524/.357 in 14 at-bats with 1 double, 1 stolen base in as many attempts, and 5 walks to 6 strikeouts.\n\nEwing stands square at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head at 9:30. He swings with a slight leg kick and has a long, whippy stroke. He has the raw bat speed to catch up to pitches down in the zone but still needs to shorten his swing to deal with pitches up in the zone. At 6’, 175-pounds, Ewing has room to continue growing and adding muscle mass, but he still is capable of making surprisingly loud contact. When he makes square up on the ball, he is capable of posting exit velocities over 100 MPH, though he posted more high-80s and low-90s exit velocities in exhibitions and tournaments in his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons than he did 100s. He does most of his damage to his pull side and has been pull-happy in general over the course of his high school career.\n\nEwing has above-average speed and is a strong defender as a result. A middle infielder, he currently profiles better at second base than at shortstop as his arm is only average and would be stretched at short. That is not to say that he can’t play the position in the near long term, as he as quick-twitch athletic, showing good reaction times and plenty of range but his arm might be stretched as plays get more and more advanced at higher levels of the minor leagues.\n\nWilly Fanas, OF\n\nInitially connected to the Los Angeles Angels, their unofficial agreement with Dominican outfielder Willy Fanas fell apart and the 17-year-old went unsigned during the 2020-2021 international signing period. The outfielder filed a lawsuit in Dominican courts seeking $17 million in damages for the broken verbal agreement for $1.8 million made years earlier, when he was 14. In the meantime, he kept in baseball shape and showcased for teams for the upcoming signing period. The Mets stepped in, offered terms to Fanas that he and his family found acceptable, and ended up signing him for $1.5 million when the next signing period began on January 15, 2022. He made his professional debut with the DSL Mets later in the year and the 18-year-old outfielder hit .257/.330/.297 in 32 games with 2 doubles, 1 triple, 10 stolen bases in 13 attempts, and 11 walks to 24 strikeouts. Fanas was ranked 22 on Amazin’ Avenue’s Top 25 Mets Prospects list for 2023 based on his performance and promise. He was sent stateside in 2023 and appeared in 39 games for the FCL Mets, hitting .248/.316/.423 with 9 doubles, 3 triples, 3 home runs, 4 stolen bases in 5 attempts, and drawing 14 walks to 43 walks.\n\nFanas has a well-proportioned 6’2”, 190-pound frame that suggests future growth. He stands square at the plate, holding his hands high and swinging with a high leg kick. A switch-hitter, Fanas logged more at-bats as a left-handed hitter than a right-handed hitter but had better results as a right-hander than a left-hander this past season. His swing is short but packs a surprising punch; he shows good batting practice power and should be able to manifest it in-game in the years to come. His eye is advanced for his age and level and he has a good sense of the strike zone, keeping his strikeouts down.\n\nHis carrying tool at this point is his speed. He is an above-average runner, allowing him to stretch singles into doubles, take extra bases on the base paths, and steal bases. His speed also helps him in the outfield, giving him enough range to play center field. He might slow down as he ages and puts on more muscle mass, but should he ever need to be moved off of the position, he has an above-average arm that fits in right field.\n\nKeiver Garcia, INF\n\nCaracas native Keiver Garcia was signed by the Mets on January 15, 2023 for just $10,000. With a birthday of August 6, 2006, he was young for the class, the 2023 season being his age 16 year. He was assigned to the Dominican Summer League and played with both the DSL Mets Orange and the DSL Mets Blue. He appeared in 33 games in total and hit .219/.390/.271 with 5 doubles, 9 stolen bases in 12 attempts, and an even 23 walks to 23 strikeouts.\n\nGarcia is currently undersized even for a middle infielder, standing 5’10” and weighing 145-pounds, but he is still very young. He stands square at the plate, holding his hands low and resting his bat on his shoulder. He uses a slight leg kick and has a very level, planar swing from both sides of the plate. Despite his current diminutive size and weight, Garcia can hit the ball hard- he recorded multiple 100 MPH exit velocities in 2023 and even a handful of 105+ MPH readings- but he hits the ball on the ground too often. The preponderance of his 2023 batted ball events have launch angles less than 10 degrees or well into the negatives, and as a result, he had a 47.3% ground ball percentage. A switch hitter, Garcia hit .205/.380/.269 as a right-handed batter against lefties and .278/.435/.278 as a left-hander against right-handed pitchers.\n\nAn above-average, borderline plus runner, Garcia played second base, third base, and shortstop in 2023, but has a good chance to stick at short in the long term thanks to his exceptional range.\n\nSaul Garcia, RHP\n\nA native of Naguanagua, a city in the valley of the Cabriales River at the base of Cerro El Café and the El Trigal Mountains in central Venezuela, Saul Garcia was born on June 11, 2023. On June 12, 2021, well into the 2021-2022 international signing period, the Mets signed a contract with the 18-year-old right-hander. He was assigned to the Dominican Summer League and made 5 appearances for the DSL Mets 1, posting a 7.50 ERA in 6.0 innings, allowing 4 hits, walking 4, and striking out 11. He was promoted and sent stateside to the FCL Mets in 2022, where he posted a 4.94 ERA in 31.0 innings over 14 games, with 30 hits allowed, 23 walks, and 46 strikeouts.\n\nIn 2023, he began the season with the St. Lucie Mets and pitched with them until late August, when he was promoted to the Brooklyn Cyclones. Garcia appeared in 22 games for St. Lucie, starting 8 games as an opener, and posted a 5.35 ERA in 67.1 innings, allowing 49 hits, walking 48, and striking out 96. He appeared in 3 games for Brooklyn serving in the same capacity and posted a 3.46 ERA in 13.0 innings, allowing 12 hits, walking 4, and striking out 10. Altogether, the right-hander posted a 5.04 ERA in 80.1 innings in 2023, allowing 61 hits, walking 52, and striking out 106. His strikeout total was third-most in the Mets minor league system among players who threw less than 100 innings, trailing Douglas Orellana’s 112 strikeouts in 89.1 innings and Christian Scott’s 107 strikeouts in 87.2 innings.\n\nGarcia throws from a low-three-quarters arm slot with a long arm action through the back. He is primarily a sinker-slider pitcher, occasionally mixing in a changeup. He leans on his fastball heavily, throwing it almost 70% of the time, mixing in his slider for the other 30% and his changeup a negligible amount in 2023.\n\nHis sinker averaged 93 MPH in 2023, sitting 90-95 MPH. The pitch has a bit of arm-side movement and sink, and thanks to his steep vertical approach angle, the pitch induces groundballs at roughly a 2:1 ratio to flyballs. Batters hit just .213 against it, with a .309 slugging percentage. His slider sits in the high-70s-to-low-80s, ranging 79-83 in 2023, averaging exactly 80 MPH. The pitch has a relatively low spin rate, averaging 2350 RPM, giving it sweepy break. It generates a high number of swings-and-misses, and batters hit just .147 against it, with a .191 slugging percentage. He occasionally threw a mid-80s changeup, but the pitch was firm and below in-game standards. Besides working over this off-season to refine his mechanics to increase his fastball velocity and improve his command, the right-hander has also been working on his changeup to turn it into a more usable pitch.\n\nJordan Geber, RHP\n\nA native of Severn, Maryland, Jordan Geber attended Archbishop Spalding High School, where he lettered four seasons as a pitcher and a third baseman and was also a competitive swimmer. He graduated in 2017, attending Mount St. Mary’s University, a private Roman Catholic university in Emmitsburg, Maryland. As a freshman, he posted a 5.17 ERA in 38.1 innings, allowing 32 hits, walking 27, and striking out 35. In his sophomore year, he posted a 7.17 ERA in 59.0 innings, allowing 77 hits, walking 30, and striking out 59. His 2020 junior season was cut short due to the cancellation of the season due to COVID-19, and the right-hander went undrafted in the pandemic-shortened 2020 MLB Draft. Geber returned to the Mountaineers in 2021 and he posted a 3.88 ERA in 60.1 innings, allowing 47 hits, walking 26, and striking out 68. He went undrafted in the 2021 MLB Draft and transferred to Virginia Tech as a graduate transfer student. He appeared in 16 games for the Hokies, pitching as a starter and a reliever, and posted a 5.40 ERA in 35.0 innings, allowing 39 hits, walking 9, and striking out 40, his time and impact on the mound diminished thanks to a bad car accident that left him concussed and suffering for a long time. For a third consecutive season, though eligible, Geber went undrafted.\n\nHe joined the MLB Draft League and pitched for the Frederick Keys and appeared in four games for them, starting three. In 16.1 innings, the right-hander posted a 4.96 ERA, allowing 14 hits, walking 5, and striking out 16. The Mets signed Geber in early August and assigned him to St. Lucie Mets, where he made six appearances. He was promoted to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies in mid-September and made one appearance with them, posting a combined 5.59 ERA in 29.0 innings, allowing 35 hits, 12 walks, and 28 strikeouts.\n\nThe Mets assigned him to Brooklyn to begin the 2023 season and things went off the rails for the 23-year-old fairly quickly. In just his second start of the year, he allowed 10 earned runs in 5.2 against the Winston-Salem Dash, and was placed on the Injured List at the beginning of May due to a torn oblique. He missed roughly three months, returning to Brooklyn in early August after rehab assignments with the FCL Mets and St. Lucie Mets. After a pair of lackluster starts, he was promoted to Double-A Binghamton, where he ended his season on a high note, improbably throwing 18 scoreless innings over his last three starts with the Rumble Ponies. All in all, he posted a 4.59 ERA in 33.1 innings with the Cyclones, allowing 30 hits, walking 9, and striking out 33, and a 0.00 ERA in 18.0 innings with the Rumble Ponies, allowing 14 hits, walking 0, and striking out 11. Following the conclusion of the season, the Mets sent the right-hander to the Arizona Fall League, the only starter in the organization who went. Making 5 starts, Geber posted a 6.00 ERA in 18.0 innings, allowing 22 hits, walking 3, and striking out 15.\n\nThe 6’3”, 205-pound right-hander throws from a three-quarters arm slot. Earlier in 2023 he short armed the ball but worked with coaches in the Arizona Fall League to make mechanical improvements such as staying back, finishing pitches out in front, getting more extension in his arms and stride, and staying consistent in his follow through.\n\nGeber throws a four-seam fastball and a two-seam fastball, both sitting in the same high-80s-to-low-90s velocity band. His four-seam fastball is generally used higher in the zone, as it has slightly above-average spin and carry, while his two-seam fastball is used down in the zone, as it has a very low spin rate and has sink. He complements his fastball with a low-to-mid-80s gyroscopic slider and a high-80s cutter.\n\nPaul Gervase, RHP\n\nAs a freshman at Harnett Central High School in Angier, North Carolina, Paul Gervase already stood an impressive 5’10”. By the time he graduated in 2018, he grew almost another foot and stood an imposing 6’7”. While he did play basketball, it was only recreationally with friends and in gym class; his heart was on the baseball diamond. Despite his size and desire, Gervase wasn’t a particularly great player for most of his career with the Trojans. His fastball topped out in the low-80s, he was often timid and afraid to go after hitters, and because he was not getting the results that wanted, he was beginning to doubt himself and his future. Challenged by Lance Honeycutt, his coach, Gervase began working with Brandon Young, a Raleigh-based physical therapist specializing in pitching biomechanics prior to the start of his senior season. Young changed his mechanics, and the results were immediate. Now throwing in the mid-to-high-80s, the big right-hander had a career year, posting a 2.39 ERA as a senior. Still, his future as a ballplayer seemed bleak, as he had no college offers. Towards the end of the season, Honeycutt got a visit from Jordan Stampler, the head baseball coach of Pfeiffer University, a small D3 university in Misenheimer, North Carolina. Stampler was looking for pitchers to play for Pfeiffer in 2019 and Honeycutt recommended Gervase, who signed a letter of intent and attended the school after graduating.\n\nThe right-hander spent one year at Pfeiffer, and it wasn’t particularly impressive. Making 3 starts and appearing in 9 games in total, Gervase posted a 4.19 ERA in 19.1 innings, allowing hits, walking 15, and striking out 17. The season reignited his passion, however, and he transferred to Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, North Carolina for the 2020 season. In 2021, he transferred to and played for Pitt Community College in Winterville, North Carolina. Following the conclusion of the season, he played for the Bristol State Liners- formerly the Bristol Pirates- of the newly reorganized Appalachian League and posted a 3.63 ERA in 17.1 innings, allowing 8 hits, walking 13, and striking out 30.\n\nImprobably, during his time at Pfeiffer and Wake Tech and Pitt, Gervase kept growing, and with the additional growth, his fastball continued improving. With solid numbers and a fastball that was now touching the high-90s, he entered the NCAA transfer portal and transferred to LSU for the 2022 season. Appearing in 29 games and serving as the Tigers’ closer, the redshirt junior posted a 1.85 ERA in 39.0 innings with 22 hits allowed, 15 walks, and 52 strikeouts. After the conclusion of the season, he appeared in Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod League and posted a 1.59 ERA in 11.1 innings, allowing 5 hits, walking 9, and striking out 15.\n\nThe Mets drafted the right-hander in the 12 round of the 2022 MLB Draft and signed him to a $170,000 contract, over the post-tenth-round maximum and forcing the team to dip into their bonus pool slightly, signaling that the team had high hopes for the big man. He appeared in 1 game for the FCL Mets and 7 for the St. Lucie Mets and combined to post a 5.56 ERA in 11.1 innings with 11 hits allowed, 7 walks, and 16 strikeouts. In 2023, he began the season with the Brooklyn Cyclones, but was promoted to the Binghamton Mets late in the year after having a solid run of success. With the Cyclones, he appeared in 31 games and posted a 1.72 ERA in 47.0 innings, with 24 hits allowed, 38 walks, and 76 strikeouts. With Binghamton, he appeared in 7 games and posted a 3.60 ERA in 10.0 innings, with 5 hits allowed, 4 walks, and 20 strikeouts. At both levels, he had a 2.68 ERA in 57.0 innings on the year, with 29 hits allowed, 42 walks, and 96 strikeouts.\n\nThe 6’10”, 230-pound Gervase is an imposing presence on the mound. The right-hander throws from a low-three-quarters, almost sidearm, arm slot. Combined with his high leg lift, size, and extension, and his pitches can be difficult for batters to pick up on. His size sometimes makes it difficult for him to keep his body in sync, leading to command issues.\n\nHis fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s, and coupled with its above-average spin rates and extension off the mound, the ball jumps on hitters quickly. He complements the pitch with a full assortment of pitches. He throws a distinct slider and curveball, but both pitches have similar characteristics and bleed into each other. His slider has a bit more velocity, sitting in the low-80s, and a little less movement while his curveball sits in the high-70s and has more horizontal and vertical break. His changeup sits in the low-80s and tunnels well with his fastball, but his command of the pitch is poor and needs to be improved before it can be incorporated into his repertoire as a more reliable offering.\n\nMateo Gil, INF\n\nThe son of Benji Gil, who played for the Texas Rangers and Anaheim Angels in the mid-90s to mid-00s, Mateo Gil is a California native who grew up in Texas following his father’s retirement from professional baseball at the major league level. A divisive prospect during his time playing at Timber Creek High School in Fort Worth, Texas, the St. Louis Cardinals took a shot on the prep infielder, drafting him in the third-round of the 2018 MLB Draft and buying him out of his commitment to Texas Christian University by signing him to a $900,000 deal, almost double the MLB-assigned slot value for the 95th overall selection of $587,600. Their faith in his baseball tools paid off, as Gil hit .252/.340/.316 with 1 home run, 2 stolen bases, and 20 walks to 51 strikeouts with the GCL Cardinals that summer, and then hit .270/.324/.431 with 7 home runs, 1 stolen base, and 17 walks to 56 strikeouts with the Johnson City Cardinals in the Appalachian League.\n\nJust prior to the 2021 season, the Colorado Rockies traded Nolan Arenado to the Cardinals and Gil was included in the package that St. Louis sent to the Rockies. Assigned to the Fresno Grizzlies, the Rockies’ Low-A affiliate, he appeared in 94 games and hit .249/.294/.396 with 9 home runs, 8 stolen bases, and 21 walks to 99 strikeouts. A strong follow-up season to a weak full-season debut would have done much to improve his stock, but his 2022 was marred by injuries. An undisclosed injury delayed his season debut, and in literally the very first play of his first game back, a second injury cost him much of the season. His injured hamstring limited him to just 48 games with the Spokane Indians, the Rockies’ High-A affiliate in the Northwest League, and 10 more rehab games with their Arizona Complex League affiliate. The infielder hit .247/.305/.408 in 174 at-bats with Spokane, hitting 6 home runs, stealing 0 bases in 2 attempts, and drawing 15 walks to 48 strikeouts. The 21-year-old would have likely returned to Spokane in 2022, but the Mets selected him in the minor league phase of the 2022 Rule 5 Draft. He began the 2023 season with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies but was sent to Brooklyn after roughly a month. He spent the better part of the summer at Coney Island before returning to Binghamton in late July and even getting into a handful of games with the Syracuse Mets in late August. At all three levels combined, Gil hit .217/.287/.390 with 12 home runs, 5 stolen bases, and 36 walks to 105 strikeouts. In 62 games with Brooklyn, he hit .208/.282/.443 with 10 home runs, 3 stolen bases, and 20 walks to 56 strikeouts, and in 43 games with Binghamton, he hit .248/.313/.349 with 2 home runs, 2 stolen bases, and 15 walks to 44 strikeouts.\n\nListed at 6’1”, 180-pounds, Gil is probably closer to 200 as his upper body has filled in a great deal since first being drafted. He stands square at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head. His swings uses a small leg kick and is almost all upper body. His plate discipline is not the best, leading to a lot of poor contact and strikeouts, but he has the ability to put a charge in balls that he hits squarely with his whippy stroke.\n\nA shortstop for much of his earlier career, Gil has played more at the hot corner than he as at the keystone since returning to the field in the post-pandemic shutdown era. With a strong arm, good range, good footwork around the bag, and good reaction times, he still has the ability to play shortstop but with his thick upper body in short spurts but is probably better suited at third in the long-term.\n\nFranklin Gomez, LHP\n\nSouthpaw Franklin Gomez was signed by the Mets on January 15, 2022, the first day of the international rookie signing period. A native of Maracay, Venezuela, the 16 year-old was assigned to the Dominican Summer League, appearing in games for both Mets DSL squads. In 13 games combined, he posted a 3.67 ERA in 34.1 innings, allowing 33 hits, walking 21, and striking out 42. He remained in the Dominican Summer League to start the 2023 season, but outside of pair of blips, the left-hander was virtually unhittable. Appearing in 11 games and starting 9 for the DSL Mets Blue, Gomez posted a 2.45 ERA in 44.0 innings, allowing 4 hits, walking 15, and striking out 61. He hit his stride in mid-July, throwing 28.0 innings through the middle of August with 3 total earned runs allowed, scattering 17 hits, walking 4, and striking out 35. On August 15, he was sent stateside and promoted to the FCL Mets. He made one appearance with them, allo"
