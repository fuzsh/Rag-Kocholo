Ten-Year Longitudinal Changes in the Knee-Extension Torque–Velocity Relationship and in Maximum Muscle Power in Young, Middle-Aged, and Older Adults\n\nJulian Alcazar 1,2, Carlos Rodriguez-Lopez 1,2, Christophe Delecluse 3, Martine Thomis 3 and Evelien Van Roie 3\n\n1 GENUD Toledo Reasarch Group, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; Julian.Alzar@uclm.es; Carlos.RLopez@uclm.es\n\n2 CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain\n\n3 Physical Activity, Sports and Health Research Group, Department of Movement Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Christophe.Delecluse@kuleuven.be; Martine.Thomis@kuleuven.be; Evelien.vanroie@kuleuven.be\n\nMaximum muscle power (Pmax) is an important biomarker of physical performance in different populations ranging from athletes to older people [1]. This investigation assessed the longitudinal changes reported in young, middle-aged, and older adults in the knee extension torque–velocity (T-V) relationship and in Pmax. A total of 489 adults (311 men and 178 women, aged 19–68 years) participated in this longitudinal investigation (follow-up (median [interquartile range]) = 9.6 [9.3–10.4] years). Three age groups were created: Young (<40 years), middle-aged (40 to 59.9 years), and older (≥60 years) adults. The knee extension T-V relationship was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex, Shirley, New York, NY, USA) after several isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic trials. T-V data from each participant were fitted by a hybrid equation including a linear (slow to moderate velocities) and hyperbolic (moderate to fast velocities) region (R2 = 0.99 ± 0.02) [2]. T0 (estimated maximum isometric torque), V0 (estimated maximum unloaded velocity), and Pmax (apex of the power–velocity curve) were calculated from this equation. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess longitudinal changes and differences between subgroups. The results showed that T0 decreased significantly over time (mean [95%CI] = −1.37 [−1.85 to −0.88] Nm per year; p < 0.001). There was no main effect of sex (p = 0.268), but there was a main effect of age group (p = 0.027; the decrement was significantly higher in middle-aged vs. young adults). Changes in V0 over time did not reach statistical significance (mean [95%CI] = −0.05 [−0.091 to 0.001] rad·s−1 per year; p = 0.057), and no effect of sex was detected (p = 0.452), while a significant main effect of age group was observed (p = 0.022; the decrement was significantly higher in middle-aged vs. young adults). Pmax was found to decrease significantly over time (mean [95%CI] = −5.26 [−6.52 to −4.00] W per year; p < 0.001), while significant main effects of sex (p = 0.013; the decrement was significantly higher in men vs. women) and age group (p = 0.004; the decrement was significantly higher in middle-aged and older vs. young adults) were also noted. To conclude, Pmax decreased in young women and men (both −0.6%·year−1), middle-aged women (−1.1%·year−1) and men (−1.4%·year−1), and older women (−2.4%·year−1) and men (−2.2%·year−1). The early declines in muscle power seemed to be caused primarily by mechanisms related to force production, while the progressive decline in muscle power was associated with both force- and velocity-related mechanisms at a later age. These findings might be of high relevance to prescribe resistance training recommendations to the general population.\n\nFunding: This study was conducted under the authority of the First and Third waves of the Flemish Policy Research Center on Sport and was funded by the Flemish Government.

Effects of a Multicomponent Exercise Training Program on Lean Mass Loss Attenuation after Bariatric Surgery\n\nGiorjines Boppre 1,2, Florêncio Diniz-Sousa 1,2, Lucas Veras 1,2, Vitor Devezas 4, John Preto 4, Hugo Santos-Sousa 4, Leandro Machado 2,3, João Paulo Villas-Boas 2,3, José Oliveira 1,2 and Hélder Fonseca 1,2\n\n1 Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure (CIAFEL), Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; giorjines_boppre@hotmail.com\n\n2 Laboratory for Integrative and Translational Research in Population Health (ITR), Porto, Portugal\n\n3 Porto Biomechanics Laboratory (LABIOMEP)\n\n4 Centro de Responsabilidade Integrado de Obesidade (CRIO), Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto\n\nBariatric surgery is the most common surgical treatment performed worldwide for patients with severe obesity, resulting in substantial and sustained weight losses [1]. Nevertheless, reductions in adiposity resulting from bariatric surgery are accompanied by other detrimental consequences on body composition, namely substantial lean mass losses that can have both functional and metabolic negative consequences [2,3]. Our aim was to determine whether a multicomponent exercise training program (MExT) attenuates post-BS lean mass loss. This is an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02843048\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02843048\"}}NCT02843048). Sixty-six patients (43.0 ± 9.8 years) who underwent BS (body mass index 44.6 ± 5.5 kg/m2) were allocated to either a control (CG; bariatric surgery + standard medical care; n = 21) or an exercise group (EG; bariatric surgery + standard medical care + MExT; n = 45) and were followed for 1 year. MExT started 1 month after BS and consisted of 3 d/week, 75-min-duration multicomponent exercise sessions that included multidirectional jumps, balance, and resistance exercises. Body weight, whole-body lean mass, appendicular lean mass, and lower limb lean mass were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Explorer QDR) at pre-surgery, 1, 6, and 12 months after BS. The effect of exercise on the selected body composition outcomes was tested by linear mixed models. Data were reported as the estimated mean and standard error. Compared to baseline, both the CG and EG, at the end of the first year after bariatric surgery, showed a significant reduction in body weight (CG: −41.1 ± 1.8 kg, p < 0.001; EG: −40.0.5 ± 1.3 kg, p < 0.001), whole-body lean mass (CG: −10.20 ± 0.7 kg, p < 0.001; EG: −8.52 ± 0.5 kg, p < 0.001), appendicular lean mass (CG: −4.84 ± 0.4 kg, p < 0.001; EG: −4.02 ± 0.3 kg, p < 0.001), and lower limb lean mass (CG: −3.76 ± 0.3 kg, p < 0.001; EG: −3.24 ± 0.2 kg, p < 0.001). At the end of the first year after BS, in comparison with the CG, participation in a MExT induced whole-body lean mass loss attenuation (CG = 43.4 kg vs. EG = 44.8 kg; ∆ = −1.4 kg, p = 0.036). No differences were observed between groups at 12 months after surgery for the remaining body composition outcomes assessed. One year after bariatric surgery, significant reductions in all of the analyzed body composition outcomes were observed. Nevertheless, participation in MExT after bariatric surgery reduced whole-body lean mass losses, therefore being an effective strategy to attenuate lean mass losses after bariatric surgery.\n\nFunding: Giorjines Boppre, Florêncio Diniz-Sousa and Lucas Veras are supported by the FCT grants SFRH/BD/146976/2019, SFRH/BD/117622/2016 and UI/BD/150673/2020, respectively.

Acute Effect of Tennis Point Duration in Shoulder Torque Production and Muscular Balance\n\nAndré Brito, Diogo Carvalho, Pedro Fonseca, Sofia Monteiro, Aléxia Fernandes and Ricardo Fernandes\n\nCentre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport and Porto Biomechanics Laboratory, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, 4200-450 Porto, Portugal\n\nTennis forehand success depends on the combination of accuracy and ball speed [1]. In longer games, the influence from peripheral fatigue is higher, reducing stroke functionality [2] and changing the movement kinematics [3]. Since tennis systematic actions affect different joints, leading to unilateral musculoskeletal imbalances and injuries [4], we aimed to analyze the acute effect of a tennis point in shoulder rotation torque production and muscular balance. Six male and four female competitive tennis players (20.5 ± 1.6 vs. 14.5 ± 0.5 years, 68.1 ± 6.9 vs. 49.2 ± 4.9 kg of body weight and 176.9 ± 7.7 vs. 160.9 ± 4.6 cm of height, respectively) voluntarily performed 10 external/internal shoulder rotation repetitions of both upper limbs at 180°/s on an isokinetic dynamometer, before and after five forehand tennis points using a ball launcher defined at 72 km·h−1. A paired-samples t-test was used for the upper limbs comparisons before (M1) and after (M2) the played point considering strength-related variables (p < 0.05). The dominant upper limb presented higher torque, power, and work than the non-dominant at M1 and M2 for internal rotation (absolute peak torque: M1 38.7 ± 17.0 vs. 31.3 ± 11.9, M2 36.4 ± 15.9 vs. 30.5 ± 10.8 N·m; relative peak torque: M1 61.9 ± 16.8 vs. 51.1 ± 13.6, M2 58.2 ± 15.3 vs. 50.1 ± 12.1 N·m; average peak torque: M1 35.5 ± 16.7 vs. 27.5 ± 10.7, M2 33.6 ± 15.3 vs. 26.7 ± 9.8 N·m; total work: M1 612.3 ± 298.0 vs. 405.1 ± 179.0, M2 588.7 ± 263.3 vs. 419.3 ± 176.3 J; average power: M1 72.5 ± 39.4 vs. 47.6 ± 23.3, M2 68.4 ± 33.5 vs. 48.3 ± 22.6 W, respectively) and external rotation (absolute peak torque: M1 27.4 ± 10.1 vs. 20.6 ± 6.7, M2 27.4 ± 8.9 vs. 20.2 ± 7.0 N·m; relative peak torque: M1 44.8 ± 10.4 vs. 34.2 ± 7.2, M2 44.8 ± 7.1 vs. 33.3 ± 7.2 N·m; average peak torque: M1 23.3 ± 9.6 vs. 17.4 ± 5.2, M2 23.4 ± 8.6 vs. 17.7 ± 6.1 N·m; total work: M1 281.6 ± 84.2 vs. 216.2 ± 84.2, M2 259.4 ± 97.8 vs. 215.3 ± 86.9 J; average power: M1 32.8 ± 15.9 vs. 25.4 ± 11.6, M2 29.6 ± 13.2 vs. 24.6 ± 11.7 W, respectively). The internal/external ratios were higher in the dominant upper limb only at M2 (79.6 ± 12.2 vs. 68.4 ± 16.1%). Furthermore, the indexes of symmetry showed that only one or two tennis players (depending on the variable) presented indexes < 10% (rating from 0.3 to 58.6%). The five forehands led to a decrease in the dominant shoulder internal rotation absolute, relative, and average peak torque and tend to increase the internal/external ratio (74.7 ± 15.0 vs. 79.6 ± 12.2%) but showed no influences on the internal or external rotation of the non-dominant upper limb. Due to the extreme use of the dominant upper limb during practice, tennis players show substantially contralateral asymmetry in shoulder rotation, with this being important to implementing compensatory strength training ensuring muscular balance and joint health. The dominant limb torque and power production decrease after five forehands demonstrates the influence of the number of shots per point in strength levels, possibly decreasing forehand effectiveness.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nKolman, N.; Huijgen, B.; Kramer, T.; Elferink-Gemser, M.; Visscher, C.

However, far less attention has been spent on analyzing the effect of these devices on body kinematics [3]. We quantified the effect of repositioning the lower jaw on running kinematics in the low to severe exercise intensity domains. Ten high-level middle-distance male runners (age 26.8 ± 5.7 years, height 180 ± 6 cm and body mass 68 ± 9 kg) were recruited to perform (48 h apart) a 7 × 800 m incremental running protocol twice on a 400 m outdoor track field, with 1 km·h−1 increments and 30 s rest periods. The velocity was controlled by audible feedback signals every 100 m. To evaluate the effect of changing the lower jaw position, a placebo (without jaw repositioning) and a lower jaw repositioning splint were custom-made and manufactured for each participant and tested under counterbalanced conditions. Kinematic data were collected at 120 Hz using two high-definition video cameras (GoPro HERO6 Black, San Mateo, CA, USA) placed on a 100 m track field section. For each running intensity, six consecutive strides were analyzed (Kinovea, version 0.8.27, Boston, MA, USA) and averaged to assess the stride time, frequency, and length for each participant. Strides were also divided to obtain the step time of each foot. A paired t-test was performed to compare the kinematic variables obtained between the two different experimental conditions, and between feet in each experimental condition (with the significance level set at p ≤ 0.05). The values of stride time, frequency, and length were similar between the placebo and jaw repositioning conditions across all the studied running intensities. However, when wearing the repositioning splint, the stride length presented a tendency to be lower in the low-intensity domain (2.93 ± 0.33 vs. 2.97 ± 0.34 m, p = 0.08, Cohen’s d = 0.6). Despite no differences in stride time between experimental conditions, the step time performed by each foot in the placebo exhibited 2–3% asymmetry (e.g., 0.33 ± 0.01 vs. 0.32 ± 0.02 s) across all the evaluated intensities. When wearing the repositioning splint, the step time asymmetry between feet was only observed at the heavy-intensity domain (~3%). Although changing the lower jaw position did not improve stride-related variables, no negative effects were observed, and wearing a repositioning splint led to more symmetric step times than placebo. The ergogenic effects on aerobic and anaerobic performance of wearing repositioning splints reported in the literature [1,2], concurrently with our findings on the step time symmetry and the lack of detrimental effects on running kinematics, might encourage runners to trial this type of oral device. However, further studies should be conducted from a biophysical perspective to better understand the effects of changing the lower jaw position during exercise.\n\nFunding: This research was funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), grant number 2020.05012.BD.\n\nReferences\n\nSchultz Martins, R.; Girouard, P.; Elliott, E.; Mekary, S.

Multicomponent Online Exercise Training Improved Lower Body Strength of Older Adults Who Used to Exercise in In-Person Exercise Programs Prior to the Outbreak\n\nSusana Carrapatoso 1,2, Pedro Abdalla 1,3, Carla Cadete 4,5, Joana Carvalho 1, Maria Paula Santos 1 and Lucimére Bohn 1,2,*\n\n1 Research Center in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure (CIAFEL), Faculty of Sports, University of Porto (FADEUP), Portugal Laboratory for Integrative and Translational Research in Population Health (ITR), Porto, Portugal; scarrapatoso@fade.up.pt\n\n2 Faculty of Psychology, Education and Sport, University Lusófona of Porto, Porto, Portugal\n\n3 College of Nursing of the University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto (EERP/USP), Brazil\n\n4 Research Center Hei-Lab—The Playful Interaction Design Lab, Porto, Portugal\n\n5 School of Communication, Architecture, Arts and Information Technologies, University Lusófona of Porto, Porto, Portugal\n\nThe current aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online-exercise program on physical fitness in community-dwelling older adults. This is a non-randomized controlled trial study comprising 62 older adults (74.59 ± 5.79 yrs, 59.7% women) who used to exercise in the in-person exercise program Mais Ativos, Mais Vividos, hosted in the Faculty of Sports, University of Porto. Because the in person-program was interrupted as a consequence of the outbreak, older adults were invited to integrate into an intervention group (IG). Those participants who did not could follow the online program constituted the control group (CG). The IG group was submitted to an 8-month online exercise program (3 sessions/week, multicomponent regime). Physical fitness (senior fitness test) was assessed prior to and after the intervention. Changes over time were modeled using a linear mixed model. The IG did not improve physical fitness. After adjustments for age, sex, and body fat, there was a minimal significant benefit for lower body strength favoring the IG (group × time interaction 1.55 (0.65); p = 0.020). The online exercise program did not improve overall physical fitness, but a slight improvement was observed concerning lower body strength.\n\nFunding: This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology: CIAFEL—Research Center in Physical Activity, Health, and Leisure (grant no.

Gomes 1,3\n\n1 University of Coimbra, Faculty of Sport Sciences and Physical Education, Coimbra, Portugal\n\n2 LARSYS, Interactive Technologies Institute, 9020 105 Funchal, Portugal\n\n3 University of Coimbra, Research Unit for Sport and Physical Activity CIDAF (uid dtp/042143/2020), Coimbra, Portugal\n\n* Correspondence: afgcaseiro@gmail.com\n\nThe basketball jump shot is the shooting technique players use the most in a game of basketball. The outcome of the jump shot is mostly determined by the height, velocity, and angle of ball release [1]. Considering that the shooting distance has an impact on the kinematic variables of height, velocity, and the angle of ball release, players need to adjust their technique depending on the shooting distance to the basket [2,3]. We try to identify how increases in shooting distance reflect upon these kinematic variables and what strategies players use to overcome the increasing shooting distance. Nine male federated athletes participated. Each player performed three successful jump shots from the Free-throw (FT) line and three successful jump shots from the Three-point (3P) line. In each player, eight markers were placed to allow the digitalization of the body segments. The data were obtained through video recording (120 Hz) of the sagittal plane of movement, and exported using Tracker software, which allowed for calculation of the kinematic variables. We also calculated the position of the center of mass (CoM), which allows for the calculation of the height of the CoM at the moment of ball release, the peak height of CoM during the jump shot, and the horizontal displacement of the CoM. With the increase in shooting distance, we observed a decrease in the height of ball release, from 2.45 ± 0.09 m for the FT line to 2.37 ± 0.08 m in the 3P line. The angle of ball release also decreases with the increase in shooting distance, with 53.00 ± 5.47° at the FT line compared to 51.50 ± 4.65° at the 3P line. The velocity of ball release shows an increase with the increase in shooting distance, with 6.76 ± 0.43 m·s−1 for the jump shots performed at the FT line compared to 8.16 ± 0.42 m·s−1 for the jump shots performed at the 3P line. The results lead us to understand that an increase in shooting distance shows a decrease in the release height and angle of ball release and shows an increase in the velocity of ball release. The increase in the release velocity is necessary to overcome the larger shooting distance [3]. With the increase in shooting distance, we also observed an increase in the horizontal displacement of the CoM towards the basket, which shows that players try to reduce the shooting distance when jumping [4]. With the increase in shooting distance we observed a decrease in the height of ball release, although the peak height of the CoM increased with the increase in shooting distance, from 1.33 ± 0.07 m reached in jump shots from the FT line to 1.37 ± 0.07 from the 3P line. This may suggest that the release of the ball occurs at an earlier moment in jump shots performed further from the basket; therefore, it is suggested that players takes advantage of the impulsion generated in the jump to transfer energy to the ball.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nMiller, S.; Bartlett, R.

Their exceptional mechanical demands may contribute substantially to muscle damage and associated residual neuromuscular fatigue observed 24 to 48 h post-match but may also promote adaptations that enhance performance and/or the capacity to recover from repeated decelerations [2]. We aimed to determine the specific impact of repeated rapid horizontal decelerations on residual fatigue by comparing changes in countermovement jump (CMJ) performance following repeated sprint efforts that did or did not include rapid decelerations. Sixteen male professional U23 footballers were randomly assigned to an on-field repeated sprint protocol (2 bouts of 10 × 50 m; mean peak speed 28.3 km·h (7.86 m·s−1)), with each 50 m sprint followed by either a rapid deceleration (stop within 3 m) (RSDEC, n = 8) or a slower deceleration within 15 m (RS, n = 8). We compared performances in CMJs performed just prior to and 48 h post the RS protocols using a t-test and the effect size (ES). At 48 h post, the RSDEC group displayed significant (p < 0.01) moderate-to-large-magnitude changes in the concentric duration (ES = 1.17), eccentric deceleration duration (ES = 0.85), eccentric deceleration rate of force development (ES = −0.72), concentric impulse at 100 ms. And concentric rate of power development at 100 ms (ES = −0.79, −1.05, respectively), while there were no significant changes in the jump height or concentric and eccentric deceleration impulses. In the RS group, there were no significant changes in any variables. These results suggest that repeated sprint efforts that end with rapid deceleration result in significant residual neuromuscular fatigue, indicated by alterations in specific time-constrained eccentric and concentric CMJ kinetic variables. Performing the same number of sprint efforts with a minimal deceleration demand did not lead to alterations in any of the CMJ variables assessed. Our findings reinforce the importance of management of the deceleration component of player running loads in training, and recovery from both competitive matches and training with a large deceleration load. Our analysis also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive analysis of CMJ kinetics in the detection of residual fatigue induced by repeated decelerations.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nHarper, D.J.; Carling, C.; Kiely, J.

PAPE Responses Are Delayed When a Complex-Training Set Is Added to the Warm-Up\n\nFrancisco Cuenca-Fernández 1,2, Óscar López-Belmonte 1, Jesús Juan Ruiz-Navarro 1, Ana Gay 1, Esther Morales-Ortíz 1, Gracia López-Contreras 1 and Raúl Arellano 1\n\n1 Aquatics Lab, Departmet of Physical Education and Sports, Faculty of Sport Sciences, Ctra Alfacar SN (18011), Granada, University of Granada; cuenca@ugr.es\n\n2 Strength and Conditioning Society, Rome, Italy\n\nTo maximize performance, it has been suggested that a general warm-up should include an aerobic dynamic component performed at an intensity of ˂60% of the individual’s VO2max, as well as a skill-specific component or conditioning activities, in which the athlete practices the specific movement to be performed [1]. However, there appears to be a current tendency in the literature to assume that any improvement in performance following conditioning activities is due to post-activation performance enhancement (PAPE) and does not take into account the possible prior benefits of the warm-up activities [2,3]. The aim of this study was to determine if the warm-up that is usually performed in competition could be improved after including a set of complex training activies. Nine elite swimmers (men = 5 and women = 4) were tested in two warm-up conditions on two different days. One of them consisted of a swimming standard warm-up of 2000 m composed of varied swimming exercises (SWU), drills, and all-out trials intercalated with three swimming starts. The other one consisted of the same warm-up as SWU followed by a complex-training set (CTWU (five maximal eccentric squat repetitions on an adapted versa-pulley, followed by ten split-squat jumps)). Within the three swimming starts performed during the warm-up, the horizontal velocity of the hip during flight (VxH) was averaged and considered the baseline. In the five and fifteen minutes after the end of the in-water warm-up, swimmers were asked to perform two maximal swimming starts. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (intervention [SWU, CTWU] × time [Pre, Post_5min, Post_10min]) was used to explore the timeline performance differences between the protocols. Pair comparisons were verified with th Bonferroni post-hoc test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. There was a significant time interaction (F = 3.828; p = 0.044) and intervention × time interaction (F = 10.750; p = 0.001). In SWU, the VxH in Pre and Post_5min was similar, but there was a decrease in performance in Post_10min (Pre: 4.76 ± 0.23 m/s; Post_5min: 4.77 ± 0.24 m/s; Post_10min: 4.62 ± 0.24 m/s). In CTWU, there was a decrease in VxH at Post_5min compared to Pre; however, there was a return to baseline in Post_10min (Pre: 4.75 ± 0.22 m/s; Post_5min: 4.59 ± 0.29 m/s; Post_10min: 4.77 ± 0.20 m/s). In terms of superior performance, none of the warm-ups proved to produce better results in the swim start than the other. However, such results were better in either case depending on the time at which the task was registered. As fatigue and PAPE coexist, the intensity/volume of the conditioning activity could play an important role in preparing athletes for competition, as more intense activities could delay the time course of performance improvements and shift the window of opportunity to perform the sport task later. This could be particularly relevant in swimming, as competitors have to wait in the call room (≤20 min) between their warm-up and the race.\n\nFunding: This research was funded by the Spanish Research Agency and European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), grant number PGC2018-102116-B-I00 “SWIM II: Specific Water Innovative Measurements: applied to the improvement in performance”.\n\nReferences\n\nBishop, D.

Nutrition and Food Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Spain\n\nSports nutrition is a relatively new area of study whose objective is the application of nutritional and food science principles to the improvement of sports performance. Correct nutrition is an essential factor to maintaining the health of a professional football player, but there are also various dietary factors that can influence biomechanical, psychological, and physiological factors [1,2,3,4]. For example, the loss of excess body fat may improve biomechanical efficiency on the field [5,6]. It is rather common for coaches and athletes to focus on nutrition only during certain training or competition periods, without realizing that for optimal sporting performance it is essential to eat and nourish oneself correctly at all times [7]. The aim of this study was to intervene for one year with a continuous ideal Mediterranean Diet (MD) model (balance, equilibrium, variety) without modifying the training pattern of a professional football player in the Spanish football league, observing the changes caused in the body composition of the athlete. The intervention and data collection were carried out during 2020 and 2021. The adjustment to the diet was daily, balancing their energy intake in relation to the daily training load, with a nutritional balance within the FAO/WHO recommendations and including all food groups as dictated by the diet quality indices [8]. Different diet quality indices were also used for the overall quantitative assessment: DQI-I, adapted by Mariscal-Arcas et al. (2007), and NQI, specific to athletes and proposed by our research group in 2015 [9,10]. The initial weight of the subject was 71.10 kg, with a height of 184 cm, BMI = 21.00 kg/m2, and %fat = 10.34%. The highest values reached after the nutritional intervention were 75.70 kg weight, BMI = 22.36 kg/m2, and %fat = 9.46%. All the values indicate an improvement in the body composition of this professional footballer after the intervention for one year with an ideal Mediterranean Diet (MD) model, which could be the most appropriate way to optimize sports performance from a nutritional health point of view.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by the Andalusian Regional Government (Nutrition, Diet and Risk Assessment AGR255), FEDER-ISCIII PI14/01040 and Consejería de Transformación Económica, Industria, Conocimiento y Universidades, Junta de Andalucía P18-RT-4247.\n\nReferences\n\nScaramella, J.; Kirihennedige, N.; Broad, E.

Countermovement Jump Kinetics and Prospective Risk of Anterior Knee Pain in Male Professional Volleyball Players\n\nAlejandro del Águila Sánchez 1, Jarrod L Antflick 2, Jose Luis Hernández Davó 3 and Daniel D.

Within the diagnosis of AKP, 45% of volleyball players are diagnosed with patella tendinopathy (PT) [1]. While a number of modifiable risk factors have been identified for AKP, associations between CMJ kinetics and AKP has not been evaluated. We aimed to determine whether CMJ kinetics are associated with the risk of knee pain during the competitive season in elite volleyball based on a retrospective analysis of 71 male professional players. CMJ kinetics from a start-of-season assessment (five hands-on-hips trials) were compared in 35 players who reported knee pain (AKP) with 36 who did not (NKP). There were significant (p < 0.001) large to very large effect size (ES) differences between AKP and NKP in the eccentric deceleration phase duration (AKP: 182 ± 19; NKP: 148 ± 19; ES = 1.79), flight time:contraction time (AKP: 0.73 ± 0.1; NKP: 0.84 ± 0.1; ES = 1.20), eccentric deceleration rate of force development (AKP: 84.3 ± 19.6; NKP: 124.6 ± 25.7; ES = 1.23), concentric peak force (AKP: 25.3 ± 2.2; NKP: 28.0 ± 2.3; ES = 1.21), concentric rate of power development@100 ms (AKP: 118.2 ± 40.6; NKP: 185.9 ± 69.9; ES = 1.18), concentric duration (AKP: 303 ± 30; NKP: 268 ± 32; ES = 1.13), and concentric impulse@100 ms (AKP: 115.2 ± 15.2; NKP: 129.0 ± 17.6; ES = 0.83). There were no significant between-group differences in jump height, concentric peak power, and concentric or eccentric deceleration impulse. Eccentric and concentric variables associated with efficient stretch shortening cycle function and rapid force production/reduction, as represented by shorter-phase durations and higher rates of force/power development, appeared to be protective against experiencing knee pain during the season. In contrast, jump height, concentric peak power, and overall phase impulses were not associated with risk. While none of the players reported knee pain at the time of the CMJ assessment, the differences observed could potentially be the result of existing mechanical changes, which subsequently manifested as knee pain during the season. Further work with a more robust diagnostic criteria of AKP and tendinopathy is needed to confirm the interpretation of these findings.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReference\n\nLian, Ø.; Engebretsen, L.; Bahr, R.

Relationship between Service Velocity and ASH Test Performance in Professional Volleyball Players\n\nAlejandro del Águila Sánchez 1, Ben Ashworth 2 and Daniel D. Cohen 3\n\n1 Research Department, Alex del Águila Personal Training Center, Spain; a.delaguila.sanchez@gmail.com\n\n2 Sports Science & Medicine Department, AC Sparta Praha, Czech Republic; bennyashworth@gmail.com\n\n3 Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Santander, Colombia; danielcohen1971@gmail.com\n\nThe athletic shoulder (ASH) test is a series of maximal isometric shoulder strength assessments performed at three different shoulder extension positions (I, Y, T) [1]. These assessments are a means to profile and monitor underlying neuromuscular performance in athletes/sports with an overhead/shoulder force production component that is critical to competition outcomes, such as the serve in volleyball [2]. We aimed to determine whether ASH test I position (180° shoulder abduction) force–time variables were associated with service velocity in elite volleyball players. Nineteen (n = 19) professional players (mean weight 88.3 ± 8.3 kg) performed three dominant-arm trials of the I position ASH test on a force plate with 30 s of rest between trials. Two days later, following a specific volleyball service warm-up, the players performed five maximal volleyball serves with ball velocity measured using a radar gun. The mean serve velocity was 103 ± 7.46 (km·h). Spearman’s correlation was used to examine potential relationships between service velocity (maximal performance in each) and ASH test force–time variables: Absolute (ABS) and bodyweight-adjusted (BW) peak force (PF), and the rate of force development (RFD) epochs of 0–50, 0–100, 0–150, and 0–200 ms. Correlations between velocity and force–time variables were RFD0-50: ABS; r = 0.62 p = 0.005, BW; r = 0.57 p = 0.010, RFD0-100: ABS r = 0.60, p = 0.007; BW r = 0.61 p = 0.006, RFD0-150: ABS r = 0.39 p = 0.095; BW r = 0.34 p = 0.150, RFD0-200: ABS r = 0.27, p = 0.26; BW r = 0.20 p = 0.42 and peak force: ABS r = −0.18 p = 0.46; ABS r = −0.21, p = 0.38. Specific ASH-I position variables representative of the early rate of force production (RFD0-50, RFD0-100) significantly correlated with the service velocity (Spearman’s r > 0.6 and p values < 0.05), but peak force and RFD0-200 did not. These findings demonstrate the importance of, or association between, early rapid isometric force production characteristics and an important dynamic high velocity activity within volleyball and relevance to athlete profiling in the sport. This simple-to-perform isometric test may be a useful monitoring tool for volleyball players’ upper body “readiness” for, or neuromuscular response to, competitive matches. Future research should examine potential associations between improvements or decrements in I position variables and changes in service velocity.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nAshworth, B.; Hogben, P.; Singh, N.; Tulloch, L.; Cohen, D.D.

Analysis of Physical Demand in the Brazilian Soccer Championship in the 2020/21 Season Using Main Components\n\nRodrigo dos Santos Guimarães 1, Vitor Bertoli Nascimento 2, Tomas García-Calvo 1, David Lobo-Triviño 1, Ana Rubio-Morales 1 and Juan José Pulido 1\n\n1 Facultad de Ciencias del Deporte, Universidad de Extremadura; rodrigo.sportcoach@gmail.com; tgarciac@unex.es; davidlobo123@gmail.com; anrubiom@unex.es; jjpulido@unex.es\n\n2 Department of Physical Education, Universidade de Londrina; vitorbertolinascimento@yahoo.com.br\n\nWith the use of new technology in sport, a great amount of information is generated in each training session and competition. Among these technologies, the use of GPS is widespread in soccer. For a better understanding of the complexity and interrelation of the physical demands of games and training, the use of machine learning techniques as main components is recommended. This technique allows for a reduction in the number of variables, information about the contribution of each of the variables created to explain the phenomenon, in addition to the contribution of the original variables in the reduced variables, allowing compression of the dynamics of physical demand. The aim of the present study was to describe the physical demands of professional soccer players at different stages of competition through the analysis of principal components (PCA). PCA was used to reduce ten variables: Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), meters covered per minute, total distance covered, distance covered at high intensity, the distance between 4 m/s and 5.5 m/s, number of sprints > 23 km/h, number of accelerations, and number of decelerations, and training impulse (TRIMP). The sample consisted of 35 soccer players from a professional Brazilian soccer team that played in the second division of the national league, with 38 games analyzed. Two main components were created, and these account for 71.6% and 15.7% for the first round and 72.7% and 14.7% for the second shift. The variables that most contributed to the first component in the first round were deceleration (14.27%), total distance (14.14%), acceleration (13.51%), and distance covered at 4 m/s to 5.5 m/s (13.46%), and for the second component, they were meters per minute (60.44%) and RPE (12.81%). For the second round, a greater contribution was observed for the distance covered between 4 m/s and 5.5 m/s, with a reduction in the contribution of the number of accelerations for the first component, deceleration (14.22%), total distance covered (13.97%), distance covered from 4 m/s to 5.5 m/s (14.33%), and acceleration (12.23%), and for the second component, meters per minute and RPE in addition to the reduction of the contribution of RPE (10.95%) for the second component. Such changes in the contributions of physical demand variables in the main components suggest a modification in the team’s tactical behavior, which caused a reduction in the acceleration contribution and an increase in the numbers of the variable 14.4 to 19.8 km/h. Thus, we can conclude that the use of the technique of main components helps to understand the physical demands of soccer games, with an alteration between the first and second phases of competition being observed in the investigated sample.\n\nFunding: This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (Government of Spain, grant number IJC2019-040788-I” and “by European regional development fund and Government of Extremadura (Spain, grant number GR18102).\n\n2.13. Influence of Undulating vs. Traditional Microcycle Periodization on the Weekly External Loads and Match Day’s Readiness Level in Elite Academy Soccer Players\n\nTom Douchet 1,2,*, Christos Paizis 2 and Nicolas Babault 2\n\n1 Center for Performance Expertise, CAPS, U1093 INSERM, Sport Science Faculty, University of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 3 allée des Stades Universitaires, BP 27877, CEDEX, 21078 Dijon, France; tom.douchet@egmail.com (T.D.); christos.paizis@u-bourgogne.fr (C.P.); nicolas.babault@u-bourgogne.fr (N.B.)\n\n2 Dijon Football Côte d’Or (DFCO), 17 rue du Stade, 21000 Dijon, France\n\n* Correspondence: tom.douchet@egmail.com; Tel.: +33-3-80-39-67-01\n\nIn the context of academy soccer teams, coaches aim to develop players’ physical qualities. The literature demonstrates that the most demanding sessions (MDS), supposed to enhance players’ development, are usually performed four and three days before match day (MD-4 and MD-3) during traditional (TRAD) soccer periodization [1]. However, other sports implement undulating periodization (UND) with their most demanding sessions on MD-4 and MD-2, and a low-load session on MD-3 [2]. The low load session on MD-3 could therefore increase players’ readiness level on the second-most demanding session (MDS2) and lead to increased external loads. Performed week after week, these increased external loads could potentiate long-term physical development. However, the distance between MDS2 and MD could lead to a decreased readiness level on MD. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of UND on players’ external loads on MDS2, and their readiness level on MD in comparison to TRAD. Twenty-eight elite academy soccer players from the U17 and U19 teams were tested over 5 weeks. The contents of weeks 1 and 4 were strictly similar and were supposed to lead to comparable physical levels on the tested weeks (weeks 2 and 5). Weeks 2 and 5 were randomized with UND (MDS1 on MD-4 and MDS2 on MD-2) or TRAD (MDS1 on MD-4 and MDS2 on MD-3). TRAD and UND implemented similar contents during weeks 2 and 5. However, MD-3 and MD-2 contents were reversed on UND in comparison to TRAD. MDS2 was a strength/speed-oriented session supposed to enhance high-speed running and sprint running. Players wore a 15-Hz GPS and rated their perceived exertion (RPE) for each session. Tests were conducted on MD-4 for baseline values (PRE) and repeated before (POST) a friendly match on MD. Tests consisted of a counter-movement jump (CMJ), 20 m sprint, Illinois agility test (IAT), and Hooper questionnaire (for the subjective fitness level). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. On MDS2, players reported similar total distance, distance in 0–15 km/h and 15–20 km/h thresholds, number of accelerations >3 m/s−2, decelerations <−3 m/s−2, and RPE between TRAD and UND. However, players reported greater distances during UND than TRAD in 20–25 km/h (306.36 m ± 117.11 vs. 223.52 m ± 92.28, p < 0.05) and >25 km/h (89.56 m ± 44.86 vs. 67.21 m ± 44.58, p < 0.05). Tests revealed identical values for PRE between the two tested weeks for CMJ, 10 m, 20 m, and IAT. For POST, CMJ, 20 m, and IAT were similar between UND and TRAD. However, the 10 m (1.89 s ± 0.10 vs. 1.92 s ± 0.09, p < 0.05) and Hooper index (7.90 A.U. ± 2.14 vs. 9.50 A.U. ± 3.44, p < 0.05) tests reported lower values in UND compared to TRAD. The results of the present study demonstrated that UND can be a good alternative to TRAD as it can lead to increased distances in high-speed and sprint running. Furthermore, in comparison to TRAD, UND does not lead to increased fatigue on MD.\n\nFunding: The present study was financed by the Center for Performance Expertise.\n\nReferences\n\nDouchet, T.; Paizis, C.; Babault, N.

Therefore, coaches try to optimize the training content and order in which they implement them. Previous unpublished observations [1] demonstrated that undulating periodization increased the high-intensity external loads without additional performance decrements on match day (MD). Practitioners usually implement aerobic sessions during the early- mid-week, and strength/speed sessions during mid- late-week [2]. However, the order in which physical qualities are implemented during the week could be questioned. This study aimed to investigate whether the order of the physical qualities influenced the external loads and the subsequent readiness level on MD. Thirty-two elite academy soccer players from the U17 and U19 teams were tested over five weeks. The contents of weeks 1 and 4 were strictly similar and were supposed to lead to comparable physical levels on the tested weeks (weeks 2 and 5). Weeks 2 and 5 were randomized with Aerobic/Strength-Speed periodization (AER/SS) (Aerobic session (AER) on MD-4 and Strength-Speed (SS) on MD-2), or Strength-Speed/Aerobic (SS/AER) periodization (SS on MD-4 and AER on MD-2). AER/SS and SS/AER implemented similar contents during weeks 2 and 5. Players wore a 15-Hz GPS and rated their perceived exertion (RPE) for each session. Tests were conducted on MD-4 for baseline values (PRE) and repeated before (POST) a friendly match on MD. Tests consisted of a counter-movement jump (CMJ), 20 m sprint, Illinois agility test (IAT), and Hooper questionnaire (for the subjective fitness level). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. For AER, players reported similar total distance, distance in 0–15 km/h and >25 km/h thresholds, number of accelerations >3 m/s−2, decelerations <−3 m/s−2, and RPE between AER/SS and SS/AER. However, players reported greater distances during AER/SS than SS/AER in 15–20 km/h (1273.53 m ± 328.51 vs. 1174.84 m ± 210.33, p < 0.05) and 20–25 km/h (658.92 m ± 264.41 vs. 478.17 m ± 259.10, p < 0.01). For SS, players reported similar total distance, distance in 0–15 km/h and 15–20 km/h thresholds, number of accelerations >3 m/s−2, decelerations <−3 m/s−2, and RPE between AER/SS and SS/AER. However, players reported greater distances during SS/AER than AER/SS in 20–25 km/h (298.84 m ± 120.12 vs. 223.24 m ± 114.86, p < 0.05) and >25 km/h (110.74 m ± 34.65 m vs. 84.96 ± 43.85, p < 0.05). Tests revealed identical values for PRE and POST between the two tested weeks for CMJ, 20 m, and IAT. The results of the present study demonstrated that the order of the sessions does not lead to significant differences in readiness level on MD. Additionally, players were shown to be more efficient during the early week. Therefore, coaches should place the physical quality they consider most important first.\n\nFunding: The present study was financed by the Center for Performance Expertise.\n\nReferences\n\nDouchet, T.; Paizis, C.; Babault, N.

Cyclic Velocity Fluctuation in Elite- and Good-Level Backstrokers\n\nAléxia Fernandes 1, Susana Soares 1, Francisco Silva 1, Bruno Mezêncio 2, João Paulo Vilas-Boas 1 and Ricardo J. Fernandes 1\n\n1 Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport and Porto Biomechanics Laboratory, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; alexiaafernandes@gmail.com; susana@fade.up.pt; frantsilva@gmail.com; jpvb@fade.up.pt; ricfer@fade.up.pt\n\n2 Biomechanics Laboratory, School of Physical Education and Sport, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; brunomezencio@msn.com\n\nCyclic movements are known to display a repeating structure due to their continuity, although fluctuation can be accepted, producing similar but not identical repetitive cycles [1]. Backstroke swimming is a cyclic and continuous movement, with repetitive upper and lower limbs propulsive actions. Attending to the aquatic environment particularities, velocity fluctuation may be higher [2], but these constraints are likely dealt with differently among swimmers, depending on their flexibility skills, i.e., performance level. The current study aimed to assess cyclic velocity fluctuation in elite- and good-level swimmers performing the backstroke technique. Four elite- and four good-level male backstrokers (17.0 vs. 16.3 ± 1.0 years old, 177.5 ± 1.9 vs. 179.5 ± 3.5 cm height, 65.1 ± 3.8 vs. 67.5 ± 10.8 kg weight and 709 ± 155 vs. 402 ± 50 FINA points, respectively) performed, in a 25 m indoor pool, a 25 m maximal backstroke and were recorded in the sagittal plane using underwater and aerial cameras (fixed to a setup able to be pushed alongside the pool). Velocimetric data were assessed, and calculations of biomechanical variables (mean velocity, minimum and maximum relative to mean velocities, intra-cycle velocity variation, stroke index, stroke rate, stroke length, indexes of coordination, and synchronization) were performed and compared using an independent-samples t-test. The intraclass correlation coefficient assessed the intra-subject velocity cycles correlation (p < 0.05). Elite swimmers presented higher mean velocity and lower stroke rates than the good-level swimmers (1.70 ± 0.11 vs. 1.47 ± 0.11 m·s−1 and 0.89 ± 0.05 vs. 0.74 ± 0.07 cycles·s−1), but no differences were found in minimum (0.74 ± 0.02 vs. 0.77 ± 0.02) and maximum (1.30 ± 0.03 vs. 1.27 ± 0.02) relative velocities, intra-cycle velocity variation (13.4 ± 1.48 vs. 13.7 ± 0.96), stroke index (3.28 ± 0.24 vs. 2.94 ± 0.32), stroke length (1.93 ± 0.04 vs. 1.99 ± 0.14 m·cycle), index of coordination (−7 ± 5 vs. −7 ± 9%), and synchronization (−0.01 ± 0.14 vs. 0.01 ± 0.02). Nevertheless, good-level swimmers presented smoother and more identical velocity cycles in-between, with ICC = 0.92 (0.80–0.99 95%CI) vs. 0.51 (0.18–0.83 95%CI). The similarity between performance levels regarding the majority of the studied biomechanical variables suggests a loss of information when using mean values, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation to describe motion characteristics, influencing the variability assessment by diminishing the chances of detecting existing differences. In fact, elite swimmers showed higher cyclic velocity fluctuation likely due to their system flexibility to explore different strategies to find the most effective action. Higher plasticity improves the ability to face aquatic environment constraints and, therefore, performance variability is an optimality and adaptability indicator.\n\nFunding: This research was funded by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), grant number DFA/BD/6799/2020.\n\nReferences\n\nPreatoni, E.; Hamill, J.; Harrison, A.J.; Hayes, K.; Van Emmerik, R.E.; Wilson, C.; Rodano, R.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effects of a 6-month multicomponent training (MCT) and the consequences of a 4-month detraining period on relative lower-limb power of older adults with limited functional capacity. A total of 65 older adults (47 women; 81.1 ± 6.0 years) were divided into a control (CON: 24) or training group (TRAIN) following a quasi-experimental design. The TRAIN performed a 6-month MCT, while CON continued with their usual lifestyle. In order to participate in the study, participants had to be older than 65 years and present a score between 4 and 9 points in the Short Physical Performance Battery. Lower limb relative power was assessed by validated equations [2], taking into account the time needed to complete the five sit-to-stand repetitions test and using participants’ height and chair height. Evaluations were performed at baseline, at the end of the MCT (6-month), and after the detraining period (10-month). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measures, adjusting by gender and age, were performed to evaluate the effects of training and detraining on power. The TRAIN improved their relative lower limb power after MCT (absolute change: 1.26 ± 0.10 W·kg−1) and decreased it after the detraining period (absolute change: −0.56 ± 0.09 W·kg−1; all p < 0.05). Nevertheless, the level after detraining was higher than baseline (absolute change: 0.70 ± 0.10 W·kg−1; p < 0.05). On the other hand, CON showed an improvement after 6-month and 10-month periods with respect to the baseline (absolute change: 0.54 ± 0.13 W·kg−1 and 0.45 ± 0.14 W·kg−1, respectively; both p < 0.05). Between-groups comparisons showed that TRAIN obtained better performance than CON after MCT (3.12 ± 0.13 W·kg−1 vs. 2.29 ± 0.17 W·kg−1; p < 0.005), although no differences were found between groups after the detraining period. Group-by-time interactions were found for the 6-month MCT, the following 4 months of detraining, and the whole 10-month study (all p < 0.05). Although, to a lesser extent, the CON participants also improved their power, perhaps due to the familiarization with the test, higher motivation derived from the healthy lifestyle talks, or other unknown causes. The MCT seems to be an effective strategy to improve relative lower-limb power in older adults with functional limitations. The 4-month detraining period reduced the magnitude of the improvement witnessed immediately after the MCT, although this was still significantly superior to baseline levels. Result suggests that the shorter the non-training period, the better the maintenance of the benefits of training.\n\nFunding: The authors are grateful to all collaborators: The nursing homes, health centers, and participants involved in the EXERNET-Elder 3.0 project and council social services, whose cooperation and dedication made this study possible.

For this reason, to assess athletes, practitioners frequently utilize different multidirectional sprint tests, some requiring rapid and aggressive decelerations and directional changes (e.g., 505 test) and others focused on less sharp maneuvers (e.g., Zigzag test) and curved sprint (CS) actions [2]. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between linear (5, 10- and 17-m) and different multidirectional sprint speed tests (CS, Zigzag, 505) in soccer players. Thirty-nine male young elite soccer players (16.3 ± 0.7 years) from a first-division Brazilian professional team’s academy performed linear sprint, CS, Zigzag, and 505 change of direction (COD) tests. A Pearson product–moment analysis was performed to determine the correlations among the distinct variables. Moderate to large associations were observed between linear (5-, 10- and 17-m) and CS (r = 0.53–0.88; p< 0.05) and Zigzag performances (r = 0.36–0.40; p< 0.05) and between CS and Zigzag (r = 0.42; p< 0.05). Conversely, no meaningful correlations were found between 505 and linear sprint (r = 0.16–0.24; p > 0.05), CS (r= 0.15–0.20; p > 0.05) and Zigzag (r = 0.24; p > 0.05) tests. The present results indicate that shallow directional changes (i.e., Zigzag: 90°–100°) were associated with linear and CS (in which velocity maintenance is key), whereas more aggressive COD (i.e., 505: 180°) were not. The movement patterns (e.g., body lateral inward lean and thigh separation at touchdown) and force application characteristics (e.g., increased mediolateral ground reaction forces) in the Zigzag and CS may have potentially impacted, at least in part, the relationships identified. The 505, conversely, is mainly characterized by greater braking requirements and considerable ankle dorsiflexion, knee and hip flexion, and trunk lean angles [3], which may explain why significant correlations with CS and Zigzag results were not observed. In conclusion, it seems that exercises aimed at improving the ability to perform COD actions of ~90° may potentially result in an enhanced capability to sprint along curvilinear paths, which may not be the case with drills focused on sharp COD maneuvers that require higher deceleration efforts and a greater reduction of the velocity of the center of mass.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nBloomfield, J.; Polman, R.; O’Donoghue, P.

However, to date, there is a limited understanding of how these qualities differ between playing positions and age categories (i.e., Under-17 (U17) and Under-19 (U19)) in amateur players, and whether meaningful associations exist between the aforementioned variables. Thus, this study aimed to compare the body composition and physical qualities of U17 and U19 forwards (FW) and backs (B), and examine the correlations between body composition, jump, sprint, and relative strength performances. Fifty-two young male rugby players (U17 (n = 30): 16.2 ± 0.6 years and U19 (n = 22): 18.09 ± 0.9 years) performed the following assessments: Anthropometrics (height and body mass (BM)) and body composition (∑3 skinfolds (SF), body fat (BF), and lean body mass (LM)), vertical jump, 30-m sprint, and squat one-repetition maximum (1RM SQ). The differences between positions and categories (U17 FW vs. U17 B vs. U19 FW vs. U19 B) were analyzed through a one-way ANOVA, with a post-hoc Bonferroni analysis used to determine the origin of any differences. A Pearson product–moment analysis was performed to determine the correlations between the distinct variables. Significant differences were observed for BM and body composition variables among playing positions independently of the age category (p: 0.05 to < 0.001; ES: 0.72 to 2.24). Regarding physical qualities, U17 FW showed significantly different performances across all variables when compared to U19 B (p: 0.05 to < 0.001; ES: 1.08 to 3.21). Moreover, U17 FW showed lower relative strength (p: 0.05–0.095; ES: 1.66 to 1.88) and slower 30-m sprint times (p: 0.024–0.018; ES: 0.57 to 1.82) when compared to U17 B and U19 FW. Overall, in B, significant correlations were observed between BM and LM and all the other variables (r: −0.72 to 0.50). Conversely, for FW, BF and SF were mostly related to vertical jump and sprint times (r: −0.62 to 0.52) but not to relative strength. In conclusion, clear differences exist between playing positions (i.e., B vs. FW) independently of the age category, but no differences were observed when comparing U17 B and U19 B. Concerning body composition, LM may represent an important indicator for strength, jump, and sprint performances among B. Lastly, for FW, SF and BF were related to jump and sprint performance. The present findings may have important implications for talent identification and long-term player development. Practitioners are recommended to monitor these body composition variables due to the level of association found with explosive actions (i.e., sprinting and jumping).\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nDarrall-Jones, J.D.; Jones, B.; Till, K.

Which Physical Performance Test Is Best Associated with an Improved Vitality in Employees of a Spanish Multinational Company?\n\nPaola Gómez-Redondo 1,*, Javier Leal-Martín 1,2, Victoria Marín 3, Pilar Urdiola 3, Ignacio Ara 1,2 and Asier Mañas 1,2\n\n1 GENUD Toledo Research Group, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; *paola.gomez1@alu.uclm.es\n\n2 CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), Madrid, Spain\n\n3 Media and People Services Department. Health Area, Grupo Red Eléctrica de España SAU, Madrid, Spain\n\nThe aim of the present work was to analyze which physical performance test is best associated with the level of vitality in workers. In this cross-sectional study, 287 company workers (100 women; 45.5 ± 10.1 years; BMI: 25.5 ± 4.2 kg/m2) participated. Vitality was measured using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). In addition, the following physical performance tests were assessed: (1) Handgrip test, (2) CMJ jump, (3) Mcardle step test, (4) sit-and-reach, and (5) Flemish balance. A Spearman correlation analysis was performed for the physical performance tests and vitality. Tests that correlated significantly (p < 0.05) were subsequently entered into a linear regression model, which was adjusted for various covariates (gender, age, BMI and number of diseases). The two physical performance tests that correlated significantly with vitality level were the handgrip test (ICC = 0.245; p ≤ 0.001) and the CMJ jump test (ICC = 0.119; p = 0.044); however, no significant correlation was found for time on the step (ICC = 0.074; p = 0.213), sit-and-reach (ICC = −0.037; p = 0.537), and Flemish balance (ICC = 0.033; p = 0.584) tests. The linear regression model showed that the handgrip test was significantly associated with employee vitality levels (β = 0.219; p = 0.029), regardless of the covariates included. This model explained 29.9% of the variance in employee vitality scores. The only physical performance test that was associated with workers’ vitality was the handgrip test. Although vitality depends on multiple factors, our findings indicate that companies should promote physical exercise, especially strength training, as an alternative to increase the well-being and health of their employees.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\n2.20.

Similar to the DVJ, rapid horizontal decelerations require the generation of high ground reaction forces (GRFs) in short timeframes and could expose athletes to high-impact peaks and loading rates upon ground contact [2]. Therefore, this new DVJ classification approach could provide additional insight into the qualities underpinning rapid horizontal deceleration ability. Twenty-three male (age: 19.9 ± 1.9 years; height 180 ± 8 cm; body mass 74.6 ± 19 kg) team-sport athletes performed (1) DVJs on force plates (PASCO Scientific) connected to ForceDecks acquisition software (Vald Performance) from a 40 cm height and (2) maximal horizontal deceleration, measured using radar (Stalker ATS II), following a 20 m sprint. Using a median split, athletes were dichotomized into high (n = 11; mean = −5.05 ± 0.21 m·s−2) and low (n = 12; mean = −4.32 ± 0.42 m·s−2) horizontal deceleration, and their SSC function was categorized based on the presentation of a visible impact peak during the first 20% of ground contact, and whether they displayed spring-like behavior (defined as a Pearson product moment correlation between vertical GRF and vertical center-of-mass displacement of <−0.80). Athletes were rated as GOOD (no impact peak and spring-like), MODERATE (impact peak but still spring-like), or POOR (impact peak and not spring-like). Despite similar spring-like behavior, a greater proportion of the high-deceleration group performed the DVJ with no impact peak (82 vs. 33%, respectively). We suggest this combination of features could be due to superior lower limb pre-impact and rapid reactive reflex muscle activation during the downward (eccentric) phase of the jump. During horizontal deceleration, these capabilities may enable higher braking impulses and active force distribution across lower limbs during each braking step, contributing to better horizontal deceleration capacity.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding\n\nReferences\n\nPedley, J.S.; Lloyd, R.S.; Read, P.J.; Moore, I.S.; Myer, G.D.; Oliver, J.L.

Preseason training lasts only 6–8 weeks in professional soccer teams, but it is a crucial period because players often return in a significantly detrained state as a result of the summer intermission period. Adaptations to preseason training stimuli may not occur uniformly in all players. Individual features such as physical fitness, age or body composition, and external conditions (energy-intake, lifestyle habits, main job, etc.) surrounding the players may determine the physiological stress athletes can withstand [1]. That is why it is recommended to assess body composition, physical performance factors, and several biological, hormonal, and psychological markers to periodically monitor both daily training load and fatigue levels [1]. In spite of their practical importance, there is a lack of evidence about preseason changes in physical fitness and physiological markers of amateur female soccer players. Then, the purpose of this study was to investigate the magnitude of changes in anthropometry, sprint and jump capacity, and physiological stress biomarkers among amateur female soccer players during the preseason. Twenty-two amateur female soccer players (23.68 ± 3.69 years) belonging to the same team participated voluntarily in this study. A 5-week training program was arranged for the transition from high-volume and low-intensity workloads to high-intensity and low-volume workloads attending to Matveev periodization. Each week was based on three training sessions (120’ warm-up, physical fitness preparation, and technical and tactical practice) and a friendly match. Body mass (BM), body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BF), heart rate variability (HRV) values, logarithm of the root mean square of successive heartbeats interval differences (lnRMSDD), standard deviation of all normal heartbeats intervals (SDNN), high- and low-frequency ratio (LF/HF), salivary cortisol and testosterone concentrations, 20 and 40-m sprint, and countermovement jump were assessed during the program (PRE, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and END). Effects related to the week load were assessed using a one-way ANOVA (time) with repeated measures. When Wilks’ Lambda indicated a significant F-value, Scheffe’s post-hoc procedures were performed to determine pairwise differences. Partial eta squared (ƞ2p) was computed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Wilks’ Lambda indicated a significant F-value in all variables except LF/LH. In addition, we mainly found differences in the tendency of improved fitness levels after the 5-week preseason training. Scheffe’s post-hoc procedures identified differences between PRE and all measurements in anthropometry variables, and between PRE and END in all variables. Regarding the anthropometric variables, BM, BMI, and BF significantly decreased through all of the preseason’s measurements, likely because female soccer players can accumulate body fat in the off-season and lose weight during the preseason training time. Heart rate variability variables (lnRMSSD and SDNN) demonstrated small decreases in all assessments and showed significant results between PRE vs. END in lnRMSSD; and PRE vs. week 2, 3, 4, and END in SDNN. These changes in lnRMSSD could be interpreted as a positive response due to a concomitant improvement in wellness variables [2]. Furthermore, Flatt et al. [2] found that the lnRMSSDmean measured three days a week is sufficient to register the 7-day average. All this enforces the idea that the implementation of HRV measurement systems in sports teams is convenient. Testosterone and cortisol increased significantly across preseason sessions; however, a decreased T/C ratio was observed, similar to what was reported in previous studies. The ratio decrease might reflect a more catabolic state at the end of the intensified period compared to the beginning of training. Finally, physical capacities improved through the 5-week training program, being significant from PRE to END. These results showed that a lower body fat percentage is associated with better sprint performance. Comotto et al. (2015) stated that acceleration and jump capacities improve from pre-preseason to mid-season due to training loads [3]. Considering that amateur players deal with many external factors, as well as individual features that may contribute to modifying their physiological status, these findings may help coaches and athletes to better understand preseason physiological stress and plan appropriate training strategies to improve athletic performance without risk of injury or overtraining.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\n2.22. Motor Units Activation Changes during Acute Muscle Pain\n\nKlaus Magno Becker 1,2, Marcio Goethel 1,2, Manoela Sousa 1,2, João Paulo Vilas Boas 1,2 and Ulysses Ervilha 3\n\n1 Center of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport (CIFI2D), Faculty of Sport, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; klausmagnobecker@gmail.com (K.M.B.); gbiomech@fade.up.pt (M.G.); manoelavsousa@fade.up.pt (M.V.S.); jpvb@fade.up.pt (J.P.V.B.)\n\n2 Porto Biomechanics Laboratory, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto (LABIOMEP), Porto, Portugal\n\n3 School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; ulyervil@usp.br\n\nIt is not fully understood how muscles can produce the same level of force under pain compared to non-pain conditions [1]. In order to investigate this phenomenon, it is necessary to assess the behavior of Motor Units (MU), which is possible through the decomposed electromyography signal [2]. This study aimed to compare the effects of induced muscle pain on the MU firing rate (FR) and recruitment threshold (RT), which is the value in V needed to recruit MUs. Based on MUs’ structural differences, the use of the silhouette criterion [3,4] approach allowed us to access the optimal number of clusters that can be found in the full set of MUs. Then, using a Kmeans approach, the MUs were grouped in clusters. A visual analog scale of 10 cm was used to quantify pain during the session, in which 0 cm represents the absence of pain and 10 cm represents the maximum level of pain. Six volunteers participated in this study. Before the beginning of the task, electrodes (Galileo-DelsysTM) were positioned in vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles. The task was performed using an isokinetic dynamometer (BiodexTM system 4) and consisted of two MVICs and, later, five isokinetic maximum concentric/eccentric contractions at 60°/s for knee extensors. All volunteers were submitted to a single bolos, one week apart, of 2.0 mL of intramuscular hypertonic 6% (Hyper) or isotonic 0.9% (Iso) saline solution, which were applied to induce pain or the placebo, respectively. Immediately after the infusion, they repeated the described protocol. A MANOVA test was used to analyze FR and RT variables between clusters, moments, and conditions, with a significance level of 0.05 and Bonferroni correction in the pairwise. The visual analog scale responses after infusions were Iso (pre = 0 and post = 1.8 ± 2.1) and Hyper (pre = 0 and post = 6.5 ± 2.7), and a difference was found between conditions (p < 0.001). The Kmeans distinguished all MUs in two groups (G1 and G2) that showed differences in all moments and conditions (p < 0.001). Regarding FR, in G1 of the MUs condition Iso and moment pre vs. Iso post, there was an increase (p = 0.03), whilst Hyper pre vs. post decreased (9.2 ± 2.6 to 2.6 ± 1.6, p < 0.001). Iso post vs. Hyper post also presented a difference (p < 0.001), and this comparison disregards the effect of intramuscular injection. The MUs of G2 decreases the FR on Hyper pre vs. post (2.9 ± 1.6 to 8.4 ± 2.5) and Iso post vs. Hyper post comparisons (p < 0.001). The RT in G1 increases in Hyper pre × post (0.19 V ± 0.09 V to 0.46 V to 0.3 V) and Iso post vs. Hyper post G1 (p < 0.001), and G2 did not change the RT. However, both G1 and G2 separately show difference in pre vs. pre (p < 0.001). Current data show that the strategy for maintaining force during pain is to increase the FR of motor units with lesser FR already recruited without pain and preserve the preferential recruited motor unit of ordinarily higher FR.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nHodges, P.W.; Tucker, K.

Short-Term Effects of Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization on Postural Stability and Mobility in Rowers\n\nDragan Marinkovic 1,*, Dejan Madic 1, Drazenka Macak 1, Danilo Radanovic 1, Zoran Gojkovic 2, Boris Popovic 1 and Nebojsa Trajkovic 3\n\n1 Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of NoviSad, 21000 NoviSad, Serbia; marinkovic@uns.ac.rs (D.M.); dekimadic@gmail.com (D.M.M.); macak.md@yahoo.com (D.M.); radanilo17@yahoo.com (D.R.); borispopovic0803@gmail.com (B.P.)\n\n2 Provincial Government and Provincial Secretary for Healthcare, 21000 NoviSad, Serbia; zoran.gojkovic@vojvodina.gov.rs\n\n3 Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Niš, 18000 Niš, Serbia; nele_trajce@yahoo.com\n\n* Correspondence: D.M.marinkovic@uns.ac.rs\n\nIt is well known that good postural stability and trunk flexibility are among the most important prerequisites for enhancing sports performance and achieving superior results [1,2,3]. In rowing, one or several athletes in a sitting position propel the boat through water via cyclical manipulation, which renders their posture unstable [4]. Consequently, adequate trunk flexibility and center-of-mass control are highly important, as biomechanical stability is essential for balance maintenance in all equestrian sports requiring prolonged sitting [5]. While different training modalities have been shown to improve those parameters, Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is particularly effective for enhancing postural stability in sport-specific environments. The aim was to explore acute effects of DNS on postural stability and trunk flexibility in elite junior rowers. The study sample comprised 40 junior rowers (16 girls and 24 boys; age 17.4 ± 2.6 years; BMI 22.3 ± 2.4 kg/m2). As a part of the study, the participants engaged in a 7-day DNS training regimen involving 2 × 30 min of daily DNS core exercise protocols as part of an international rowing camp. Testing was performed after the first day of familiarization and at the end of the training camp (at a 7-day time point). For this purpose, laboratory-grade force plate (Footscan® plate; RSscan International, Beringen, Belgium) measurements were conducted, and the data weere used to determine postural stability during the 30 s double-leg stand upright quietly with eyes open test, as well as the sit and reach test, commonly employed to assess the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. Postural stability was quantified in terms of area, anterior–posterior displacement (AP), medial–lateral displacement (ML), and displacements of the center of force (COF) as well as length function of surface (LFS). Trunk flexibility was evaluated through the sit and reach test. Paired t-tests revealed that, after a short-term DNS training intervention, all parameters related to postural stability and trunk flexibility were improved in all elite junior rowers (p < 0.001). On average, COF declined by −0.94 cm (95% CI [−1.09, −0.78], LFS was reduced by −0.06 cm (95% CI [−0.10, −0.03]), AP by −0.79 cm (95% CI [−1.00, −0.60]), and ML by −0.37 cm (95% CI [−0.47, −0.26]). Moreover, the sit and reach test mean performance improved by an average of 2.37 cm (95% CI [1.72, 3.01]). Our results suggest that a 7-day DNS training program yields improvements in postural stability and trunk flexibility. DNS training sessions appear to be sufficient at inducing positive changes in neuromuscular core anticipation and flexibility, allowing athletes to perform well during training or competition. In summary, the DNS protocol employed in this study is a promising new approach to improving postural stability and trunk flexibility in rowing and should be considered by coaches and experts in their training practice.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nReferences\n\nLiang, Y.; Hiley, M.; Kanosue, K.

Biomechanical Evaluation of Posture in Children That Do and Do Not Partake in Sports Activities\n\nDragan Marinkovic 1,*, Dejan Madic 1, Drazenka Macak 1, Danilo Radanovic 1, Aleksandra Ilic 1, Zoran Gojkovic 2 and Boris Popovic 1\n\n1 Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; marinkovic@uns.ac.rs (D.M.); dekimadic@gmail.com (D.M.M.); macak.md@yahoo.com (D.M.); radanilo17@yahoo.com (D.R.); play.dance.studio@gmail.com (A.I.);borispopovic0803@gmail.com (B.P.)\n\n2 Provincial Government and Provincial Secretary for Healthcare, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; zoran.gojkovic@vojvodina.gov.rs\n\n* Correspondence: D.M.marinkovic@uns.ac.rs\n\nAvailable scientific evidence indicates that poor posture is often formed in childhood and can, over time, progress to different deformities identified in adults [1,2,3]. However, engagement in sports activities and regular exercise, as well as a healthy lifestyle, promotes movement, muscle activation, and the formation of correct posture in childhood, thereby increasing the likelihood that an individual would maintain good posture [4]. To evaluate and compare posture in children with different levels of involvement in sports activities, the study sample comprised 290 children (114 girls and 176 boys; age 6.83 ± 1.8 years; BMI 15.33 ± 1.13 kg/m2), 189 of whom regularly participated in a variety of sports activities, and the remaining 101 did not. Using the 3D Photometric Contemplas system (Templo® Posture Analysis), the following biomechanical posture parameters were measured for both groups: Shoulder rotation (SR) and Pelvic rotation (PR) in the horizontal plane; Distance cervical spine–sacrum (APc), Distance thoracic spine–sacrum (Apt), and Distance lumbar spine–sacrum (APl) in the sagittal plane; and Distance cervical spine–sacrum (MLc), Distance thoracic spine–sacrum (MLt), and Distance lumbar spine–sacrum (MLl) in the frontal plane. Digital calculations were performed for distance, angles, and displacement. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that 67.2% of the variance in biomechanical posture parameters was associated with sports participation (p < 0.001). Moreover, on average, with the exception of APc, APl, and MLc, the values of studied biomechanical posture parameters were significantly lower in children that actively engaged in sports (p < 0.05), as determined by one-way analysis of variance. Their mean SR and PR in the horizontal plane was also greater by 4.80° (95% CI = 4.21–5.91) and 4.70° (95% CI = 4.03−5.29), respectively, relative to the non-sports group, while their mean APt in the sagittal plane, as well as MLt and MLs in the frontal plane, was lower by 0.33 cm (95% CI = 0.08–0.59), 0.26 cm (95% CI = 0.10–0.42), and 0.70 cm (95% CI = 0.01–0.14), respectively. The findings yielded by the present study suggest that involvement in diverse sports during childhood improves the biomechanical parameters related to posture, providing support for available evidence indicating that exercise programs can lessen the extent of different postural disorders in children. Specifically, the reported results imply that kyphosis, lordosis, and scoliosis and other postural issues are less prevalent in children that are physically active relative to those that are not. Sports and other forms of physical exercise should be used as corrective and preventive treatment in childhood to enhance muscle activation and inhibit postural deformities in adulthood.\n\nFunding: This research received funding from IPA Cross Border programme Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina “Improving testing abilities on pos-tural and spinal column status—SpinLab”, founded by the European Union, Directorate for European Integration (EU-IPA 2013/323-164).\n\nReferences\n\nĆirić, A.; Čaušević, D.; Bejdić, A.

Although injury incidence seems to have decreased in recent years, this trend has not changed in muscle-type injuries [1], frequently located in the hamstring muscles. Therefore, most teams have developed specific injury prevention programs, mostly based on eccentric (ECC) exercises (i.e., nordics, deadlift, leg curls, etc.), to minimize the risk of hamstring strain injuries. However, if the scheduling of ECC-based exercises during the microcycle is not properly performed, it could impair match performance or increase injury risk [2], since the effects of EC"
