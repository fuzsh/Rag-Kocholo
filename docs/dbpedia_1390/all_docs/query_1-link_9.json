        "text": "American actor and musician (born 1991)\n\nTyler Garcia-Posey (born October 18, 1991),[1] known professionally as Tyler Posey, is an American actor and musician. He performed in his early years in a number of children's film and television roles, for which he was twice nominated for a Young Artist Award. He was known for his roles as Raul Garcia in Doc (2001–2004) and Ty Ventura in Maid in Manhattan (2002). As an adult, he is known for playing the central character Scott McCall in the MTV series Teen Wolf (2011–2017),[2] although he has since been cast in a number of film roles and has also performed in voice acting roles. In late 2011 to 2012, he won a number of youth acting awards, including a Teen Choice Award, and was nominated for several others. He was active for several years in the band Lost in Kostko, which he co-founded in 2009.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPosey was born in Santa Monica, California, to Cyndi Terese Garcia and actor-writer John Posey.[3] He grew up in Santa Clarita, California.[4] Posey has two brothers.[3] He is of Mexican descent on his mother's side.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPosey has worked steadily in film and television. In February 2002, he appeared in the film Collateral Damage; in December of that year, he played the main character's son in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan.[6] He auditioned for the role of Jacob Black in the Twilight film series in 2007 but lost the role to his friend Taylor Lautner. The two regularly auditioned for the same roles as child actors.[6]\n\nIn 2011, Posey was cast in his breakout role as the lead in the MTV television series Teen Wolf, which is based on the 1985 film. Posey plays high school student Scott McCall, who is bitten by a werewolf and must keep this fact secret while protecting his loved ones from a host of supernatural threats and beings. That same year, Posey voiced a character in the pilot of the Disney original cartoon SheZow, which aired on May 4 as a part of the Shorty McShorts' Shorts miniseries.[7] He also co-starred in the 2012 film White Frog. In 2015, he became a co-producer for the fifth season of Teen Wolf.[8] In the following year, it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Teen Wolf would end in 2017 after the completion of its sixth season.[9]\n\nOn May 24, 2017, Posey was cast as Lucas Moreno in the Blumhouse supernatural thriller film Truth or Dare.[10] The film was released in theaters on April 13, 2018.[11][12]\n\nOn September 25, 2017, it was announced that Posey would join the third season of the VH1 slasher television series Scream, starring in the role of Shane.[13] The season premiered on July 8, 2019.[14]\n\nOn February 20, 2019, it was announced that Posey would star as Michael Emerson in The CW's television reboot series of The Lost Boys.[15][16] On July 29, 2019, it was announced The CW was unhappy with the pilot and that Posey, along with most of the rest of the cast, would be recast.[17]\n\nOn November 18, 2019, it was announced that Posey would star in Netflix's animated Fast & Furious television series Fast & Furious: Spy Racers, which premiered on December 26, 2019.[18]\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that a reunion film for Teen Wolf had been ordered by Paramount+, with Jeff Davis returning as a screenwriter and executive producer of the film. The majority of the original cast members, including Posey, were set to reprise their roles, with Posey also serving as a producer.[19][20] The film was released on January 26, 2023.[21]\n\nIn 2023, Posey competed in season ten of The Masked Singer as \"Hawk\". He was eliminated on \"Harry Potter Night\".[22][23]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nPosey used to front and play guitar in the band Disappearing Jamie, formerly known as Lost in Kostko. Their first performance was at The Roxy in Los Angeles in 2012.[24] Lost in Kostko released their eight-track EP You're Going to Need a Towel in 2011.[25] Posey announced the band's breakup via Instagram on July 17, 2013.[26]\n\nIn December 2016, Posey was a guest DJ at Emo Nite LA's second anniversary at the Echoplex in Los Angeles.[27]\n\nPosey played guitar and contributed vocals in the pop punk band PVMNTS along with guitarist/bassist/vocalist Freddy Ramirez and drummer Nick Guzman. The trio released the song \"Standing (On My Own Two Feet)\" on June 14, 2018, on which Posey wrote about the passing of his mother in 2014. The band self-released their six-track EP Better Days on August 17, 2018.[28] In April 2019, it was announced that Posey had left the band and was pursuing another music venture, which became the band Five North.\n\nFive North is a pop-punk rock band formed by childhood best friends Posey and Kyle Murphy. Posey and Murphy originate from just off \"The 5\" (Interstate 5 in California) in Santa Clarita, California, hence the origin of the band's name Five North.[29] The two recruited Makeout drummer Scott Eckel after being introduced by music producer and close friend John Feldmann.[30] Five North's debut single \"This Mess\"[31] was released on October 4, 2019, and their debut eight-track EP Scumbag was released on March 6, 2020, via Big Noise Music Group.[30]\n\nIn August 2021, Posey made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Broke\",[32] the song by UK pop-punk band the Bottom Line, who Posey met when touring the UK together in 2018 during his time in PVMNTS.[33]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPosey became engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Seana Gorlick, in 2013.[34] The couple broke off the engagement that same year, after a ten-year relationship.[35][36] He started dating singer Phem in 2020, and in February 2022, they announced their engagement.[37] They married in October 2023.[38]\n\nPosey's mother, Cyndi Terese Garcia, died of breast cancer in December 2014.[39] The fifth season of Teen Wolf was dedicated to her memory.[4][40][41]\n\nIn an October 2020 interview, Posey disclosed that he had begun smoking marijuana at the age of 12 and had developed an addiction. At that time, Posey stated that he had been sober for 71 days.[42] In March 2021, Posey stated that he was no longer sober but added that he had learned a great deal from his experience of sobriety.[43]\n\nAlso in October 2020, Posey revealed that he had \"hooked up\" with men and does not like to label his sexuality.[44][45] In an interview on Sirius XM, Posey said, \"I was hit with wanting to come out myself and be honest about it. I know a lot of kids look up to me, and I want to get rid of that stigma.\"[46] In July 2021, Posey came out as queer and sexually fluid.[47][48]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2002 Collateral Damage Mauro Maid in Manhattan Ty Ventura 2005 Inside Out Obert 2007 Veritas, Prince of Truth Mouse Gonzalez 2010 Legendary Billy Barrow 2012 White Frog Doug 2013 Scary Movie 5 David 2016 Yoga Hosers Gordon Greenleaf 2018 Taco Shop Smokes Truth or Dare Lucas Moreno 2019 The Last Summer Ricky Santos 2020 Alone Aidan Also executive producer 2023 Teen Wolf: The Movie Scott McCall Also producer\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001–2004 Doc Raul Garcia Main role 2002 Without a Trace Robert Episode: \"Silent Partner\" 2005 Into the West Young Abe Wheeler Episode: \"Dreams and Schemes\" Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye Danny Abas Episode: \"Boy Meets World\" 2006 Smallville Javier Ramirez Episode: \"Subterranean\" 2006–2007 Brothers & Sisters Gabriel Whedon / Gabriel Traylor Recurring role 2007 Shorty McShorts' Shorts Jose (voice) Episode: \"SheZow\" 2009 Lincoln Heights Andrew Ortega Recurring role 2011–2017 Teen Wolf Scott McCall Main role; also director (episode: \"After Images\") 2013 Workaholics Billy Belk Episode: \"Fourth and Inches\" 2014 The Exes Eric Episode: \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" 2014–2015 Wolf Watch Himself Correspondent and guest 2015 Ridiculousness Himself Season 6, episode 21 2016 Lip Sync Battle Himself Episode: \"Gigi Hadid vs. Tyler Posey\" 2016–2018; 2020 Elena of Avalor Prince Alonso (voice) Recurring role 2017 Hell's Kitchen Himself Guest diner and Leukemia & Lymphoma Society contributor (episode: \"It's All Gravy\") Jane the Virgin Adam Eduardo Alvaro Guest role (season 3);[49] recurring role (season 4)[50] 2018 Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors[51] Dante Pertuz / Inferno, Kree Guard 1 (voice) Television film Sideswiped Griffin Episode: \"Baby Steps\" 2019 Marvel Rising: Battle of the Bands Dante Pertuz / Inferno (voice) Television special Marvel Rising: Chasing Ghosts Dante Pertuz / Inferno (voice) Television special Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron Dante Pertuz / Inferno (voice) Television special Sherwood Iniko (voice) Main role Now Apocalypse Gabriel Recurring role Scream: Resurrection Shane Main role[13] 2019–2021 Fast & Furious Spy Racers Tony Toretto (voice) Main role 2021 Nickelodeon's Unfiltered Himself Episode: \"Strong Beef & Flying Teeth!\" 2023 The Masked Singer Hawk Season 10 contestant 2024 The Surreal Life Himself Main role (season 8)\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 2021 Fast & Furious Spy Racers: Rise of SH1FT3R Tony Toretto (voice)\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Artist 2011 \"Our Deal\" Best Coast 2015 \"Young & Stupid\" Travis Mills \"Secrets\" State Champs 2016 \"Colors\" Halsey 2021 \"Broke\" The Bottom Line \"Past Life\" Tyler Posey 2022 \"Everybody But You\" State Champs\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Work Result Ref. 2002 Young Artist Awards Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series – Supporting Young Actor Doc Won 2004 Young Artist Awards Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) – Supporting Young Actor Doc Nominated 2005 Movieguide Awards Most Inspiring Television Acting Doc Won 2011 Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer TV Star: Male Teen Wolf Nominated [52] Choice TV: Breakout Star Teen Wolf Nominated [52] 2012 Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer TV Star: Male Teen Wolf Won [53] ALMA Award Favorite TV Actor – Leading Role Teen Wolf Won Imagen Awards Best Actor/Television Teen Wolf Won 2013 Young Hollywood Awards Best Ensemble (shared with Holland Roden, Crystal Reed, Dylan O'Brien and Tyler Hoechlin) Teen Wolf Won [54] Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer TV Star: Male Teen Wolf Nominated [55] 2014 Teen Choice Awards Choice TV Actor: Fantasy/Sci-Fi Teen Wolf Nominated [56] Choice Summer TV Star: Male Teen Wolf Nominated [56] 2015 Saturn Awards Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series Teen Wolf Nominated [57] Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer TV Star: Male Teen Wolf Nominated [58] 2017 People's Choice Awards Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actor Teen Wolf Nominated [59] Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer TV Actor: Male Teen Wolf Won [60]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nDrugs [EP] (2021)\n\nUNRAVEL [Album] (2023)\n\nWith Lost in Kostko\n\n[edit]\n\nYou're Gonna Need A Towel [EP] (2011)\n\nWith PVMNTS\n\n[edit]\n\nBetter Days [EP] (2018)\n\nWith Five North\n\n[edit]\n\nScumbag [EP] (2020)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
