        "text": "Season Review - 2028/29\n\nAfter taking December off (too busy with work and then family stuff over Christmas) I am back!\n\nLa Liga - 1st, 88 points (quite a bit down on previous years)\n\nCopa Del Rey - Lost in SF to Barcelona\n\nSupercopa - WINNERS\n\nChampions League - Lost in SF to Man City\n\nOverall a pretty good year, we won the league thanks largely to Real not quite maximising their own season - 88 points isn't an amazing total, albeit not too shabby. We also won the Supercopa which was a nice bonus, and got conclusively beaten by a much better Man City side in the Champions League semi final. We are well into a phase now of being good enough to compete, but probably an outside shout to win the Champions League - we'd need the right run in the knockouts to have a chance I think.\n\nFor anyone interested, my experiment moving Nico Williams to right back has been pretty successful His cuts inside from both wings trait is quite interesting on a wing back.\n\nTransfers\n\nWe said goodbye to a few familiar faces this year, Aihen Munoz was allowed to depart thanks to the emergence of Eneko Cordoba, and a bit of depth in midfield meant retraining one of our CM's into left back to provide cover there. We also said goodbye to Igor Zubeldia - he did a great job for us over a few years, but again just too much depth with newgens coming through now. We also big farewell to Julen Jon Guerrero who didn't look like he would make it for us, as well as Gorka Merino (one of our hot prospects) - his development stalled and there were better options out there. We also moved on Mikel Rojo, an excellent centre forward who has been part of our team for a few years, however again just too much depth coming through to keep everyone.\n\nThe departure of Gorka Merino was pushed on by the arrival of a young talent from Real Sociedad, Julen Aguirre. We paid 32million (GBP) for him. He looks an excellent prospect with some potential and some fun attributes - he's not the ideal fit for my system but that's kinda why I went for him, I wanted a different option to use within our system who may help in certain scenarios.\n\nSquad\n\nProbably the biggest highlight of this save is having 3 French Basque players in the squad, and they're all amazing! We've also shuffled things around this summer with Unax Urrutia coming into the first team as a right back, meaning Josu Blasco has been shifted from RB to CB, allowing Javi to move into a half back role which is a better fit for him i think.\n\nGK - Simon, Agirrezabala, Iker Alvarez\n\nRB - Nico Williams, Unax Urrutia\n\nLB - Eneko Cordoba, Mikel Guruzeta\n\nCB - Dani Vivian, Josu Blasco, Carlos Saenz, Jose Jimenez\n\nDM (Half Back) - Javi, Vencedor\n\nDM (DMS) - Hugo Guillamin, Ibon Marin\n\nCM (DLP) - Sancet, Alboniga-Menor\n\nAM (AMS) - Aimar, Jon Castro\n\nCF (DLFS) - Jon Ibanez, Julen Aguirre\n\nCF (PFA) - Jon Martin, Aitor Gorrotxategi\n\nI thought given the break this was a nice time to update on development of these guys, as I normally post screenshots when they first come into the squad, so apologies for the length post with more images here:\n\nFirst up, new signing Julen Aguirre. I like his attributes for a kinda off-type DLF or AM - his passing needs some work, but his pace, flair, first touch, composure all make for an interesting player in the space between the opposition defence and midfield. He's obviously not a playmaker, but I'm looking for something different.\n\nNext up Jose Jimenez, our new option at CB - I love this guys attribute spread for a CB and he will get plenty of minutes this season, I expect him to be with us for a long time. He's one of those guys who always had fairly average potential, but just kept improving and improving and now looks like he's going to be class.\n\nEneko Cordoba is one of my real success stories - an incredible wing back for us. We paid a lot of money for him when his attributes needed a lot of work - if you look at him on my previous screenshot to see how much he's improved... wow, totally worth the outlay.\n\nIbon Marin is a tidy defensive midfielder with some quality on the ball - he can play in the DM role or the DLP role for us which is great. One of our French Basque players\n\nI had doubts about Josu Blasco simply because he felt like one of those classic full back newgens... he's kind of a good right back, kind of a centre back but not really excellent at either (unless you want a pure defensive full back). I've now moved him to CB and I have to say he's really excellent there - his attribute spread, aside from slightly low jumping reach is brilliant.\n\nCarlos Saenz - I really like this guy as a CB, good attributes, just hasn't quite kicked on in the way I hoped. None the less, an excellent option at the back.\n\nIt's been a long time now since Javi came into the side, or it feels that way. His move from CB to DM is definitely the right one. My concern with Javi is that he's had elite player potential for a long time but his rate of development is very slow, despite being a key starter for us. I think he will likely top out some way below the potential he has but will still be an awesome option for us... hopefully I'm wrong and he takes some big leaps forward!\n\nIn contrast to Javi, Jon Ibanez just keeps improving, and improving, and improving. He's now our first choice DLF and has pushed another hot prospect, Aitor Gorrotxategi out of the team. We have SO much strength in terms of forwards coming through which is awesome.\n\nJon Martin has been a top top player for us in recent seasons playing as both a DLF and PF.\n\nHe's lost his place in the first choice XI due to Jon Ibanez but he's still a very hot prospect. He is rotating with Jon Martin for the PF role and I anticipate he will be world class in the future.\n\nAnother French Basque, Mikel Guruzeta is being retrained as a left back. There's a real lack of left backs out there and we've got depth in midfield, Guruzeta is very capable as a left back so out there he goes!\n\nAt one point Jon Castro and Gorka Merino were giving me headaches in terms of how I'd fit all my AM's in the team. However both have seen their potential drop off a bit, Gorka Merino significantly so... a bit less so for Castro who is still a magnificent AM, but not quite perhaps the world class potential he once had.\n\nHopefully my future star right back. Converted from an attacking midfielder he will hopefully be a long term staple in our side.\n\nBig Update! September 2032\n\nMy last update was the 29/30 season, so I've since done two further seasons and a summer transfer window, sitting now in September 2032.\n\n30/31 Competitions:\n\nLa Liga - 2nd, 86 points (Real Madrid winners)\n\nCopa Del Rey - Lost in QF to Real Betis\n\nSupercopa - Winners!\n\nChampions League - Lost in final to PSG\n\nAhh our first Champions League final, and we sadly lost 3-1 to PSG. I said previously we probably needed a favourable draw to get to the final, and we did have one this one, however couldn't beat PSG in the final. It's a shame as we've played PSG previously and done really well, so I had high hopes, but we simply weren't good enough. A Supercopa win kept the trophy count rising though.\n\n31/32 Competions:\n\nLa Liga - 1st, 98 points\n\nCopa Del Rey - Lost in QF to Real Madrid\n\nSupercopa - Lost in SF to Real Madid\n\nChampions League - Lost in QF to Napoli\n\nBack on top of the league, but Real had the better of us in the cups. A really disappointing QF lost to Napoli, in the first leg at their stadium in the first half we managed to concede 3 goals and 2 penalties (both saved), and they still only racked up 1.85xG haha. We battered them in the second leg but only scored 2, and missed chances in the first leg also. We really should have made the semi\n\nLooking ahead in September 2032:\n\nWe've had some squad turnover this summer with some legends leaving the club... I'd like to applaud:\n\nUnai Simon - 548 league appearances\n\nDani Vivian - 442 league appearances\n\nHugo Guillamon - 250 league appearances\n\nAimar - 220 league appearances\n\nThis summer really felt like the end of an era. Unai Simon at 35, I was hoping would manage another year or two but he had declined pretty badly, he was still ok but his performances in the second half of last season showed some signs of decline. I elected to take the opportunity to bring back Julen Agirrezabala as a stop gap while I brought a couple youth prospects through. I said previously we had an issue with GK's in my save - we finally have 2 semi decent newgens who I think are going to be good La Liga level in the future, one is my back up this season (probably the worst of the two, but at 18 he's closer to stepping in), while the other is only 16 and is in the U19s still. Agirrezabala was always very capable when he was with us before, so was a no brainer. I had to pay over the odds to get him back, but at this point in my save money is no object.\n\nI still have Sancet, but again decline is setting in, this may well be his last season with us and is now a squad rotation option.\n\nWe nearly lost Nico Williams, but after some haggling I was able to renew his contract with 9 months to spare.\n\nCurrent Squad:\n\nGK - Julen Agirrezabala, Iker Alvarez, Iker Zubillaga\n\nRB - Nico Williams, Unax Urrutia\n\nLB - Eneko Cordoba, Mikel Guruzeta\n\nCB - Josu Blasco, Aitor Etxebarria, Jose Jimenez, Carlos Saenz\n\nDM - Alboniga-Menor, Javi, Jorge Murillo, Iban Marin\n\nRW - Jon Martin, Isaac Gomez\n\nLW - Julen Aguirre, Jon Ibanez\n\nAM - Jon Castro, Oihan Sancet\n\nCF - Aitor Gorrotxategi, Juan Etxabe\n\n*The three highlighted players were academy products of (all others are either original squad members or our academy players):\n\nCordoba - Arenas Club\n\nCarlos Saenz - Osasuna\n\nJulen Aguirre - Real Sociedad\n\nJulen Aguirre and Cordoba are standout first XI players of course, but Carlos Saenz is fourth choice and may well be replaced like for like with a player from our academy later this season, so only 2 players purchased from outside the club. This is both a real positive for our academy production, but also shows our poor Osasuna and Sociedad intakes have been!\n\n*A note attached to a player denotes either a lack of consistency or issue with big matches, usually not both (I think one player has both). Consistency is always an issue with academy players, but it does improve over time, so just gotta give those kids time!\n\nAs you can see, Eneko Cordoba is an absolute monster, and Julen Aguirre who I originally brought in thinking he would be a rotation option has just bloomed so well. Juan Etxabe is one I am very excited about, he's coming on leaps and bounds and could be the type of striker to fire us to Champions League glory. We are however a little lop-sided in terms of all of our strength being up front, wings and full backs - the core spine of the team (GK, CB, DM) is perhaps serviceable at best. Josu Blasco is a solid centre back, as is Alboniga-Menor in a DLP role, but we don't have a world class option in that defensive spine in any of the positions. I think going bold with our 4-2-4 is the best play, just to try to utilise our attacking players as best we can.\n\nI think next season with Sancet's likely departure, we will see Nico Williams moved back up into the attacking midfield area, as I have a good young RB ready to come in as deputy, and Unax Urrutia is ready to be first choice. Jon Martin will shift into the AM role when needed as a result, allowing Nico to play on the right wing, but my front 4 all rotate positions fairly regularly depending on need.\n\nThe Trophy Cabinet so far:\n\nLa Liga - 2026, 2029, 2032\n\nCopa Del Rey - 2024, 2030\n\nSupercopa - 2026, 2027, 2029, 2030, 2031\n\nOverall I'm pleased with this. It's perhaps one of the weaker records I've had over the years at this stage of my Athletic saves, however given how ridiculous Real Madrid are I feel like it's a pretty respectable record. I really want that European trophy, but we've not had the quality just yet to do it.\n\nEdited February 4 by bowieinspace\n\n2032/33 Update - Another Champions League Final\n\nLa Liga - Winners! 99 points, Real Madrid on 97\n\nCopa Del Rey - Lost in final to Barcelona\n\nSupercopa - Lost in final to Real Madrid\n\nChampions League - See below....\n\nClub World Cup - Lost in QF to Real Madrid\n\nSo this team is finally starting to come together - we have some balance issues in terms of a lack of true world class quality at GK, CB and DM, however there's other stuff starting to come through for us. For years this team has suffered from two main areas - 1) A lack of height and size/strength in the air and 2) Inconsistency and a fear of big matches. We've been able to flat track bully La Liga and win a good number of cups, but especially in the Champions League eventually our inconsistency hits us and we take a battering off someone at a key moment. I'm starting to see some of these areas sort themselves out now.\n\nJuan Etxabe is now the main man leading the line - he is a god as far as I'm concerned, one of those rare FM players that is just remarkably effective.\n\nIn Juan Etxabe we have an incredibly consistent advanced forward who can score every type of goal... 18 off the ball and 18 finishing, 16 pace/acceleration, 16 flair, 16 jumping reach... whereever you put the ball for this guy, to feet, the head etc, he can score, and does... frequently. He's ultra consistent and enjoys big matches. Prior to this we had Aitor Gorrotxategi leading the line.\n\nNow I love Aitor Gorrotxategi... he is a wonderful man who does a lot of charity work. Unfortunately he's always been inconsistent (per attribute, you can see above). However his consistency that used to be really terrible has improved a bit with age and he is now only fairly inconsistent... he's also developed a love for big matches which is handy. Now he is a physical monster but in a slightly different way to Etxabe - he lacks in height and can't lead the line in such a complete way as Etxabe does, but he does have great vision and good passing instead. When he was up front, too often he would drop 6.2-6.4 ratings and miss chances when I really needed him to come up big for the team. In our system now, I've been able to deploy him as an AM(A) offset from Etxabe, this allows Gorrotxategi to use his physical abilities and rounded game to influence, without being the main person required to score goals. His improvements in consistency are showing and he is getting better and better.\n\nAlongside them up front, we have Julen Aguirre, a world class inside forward, and Jon Ibanez who is a bit slower and plays more of a creator role, with some great back ups to boot. Etxabe is the key though, an aerial presence we so desperately needed. Behind them we lack the quality - a range of CB and DM options who are good La Liga players - mainly good on the ground but poor in the air (our starting CBs have 11 and 13 jumping reach). We need some size badly - a big physical CB would be the dream, but alas we do not have this at the moment, so we go with what we have.\n\nTo win the Champions League with our team over the last 5 years or so I'd say would have been difficult, requiring a bit of luck. We had one season where we reached the final but got pumped by PSG, but otherwise always dropped a stinker at some point. We had too many young players who were inconsistent, or older players who disliked big matches. This is changing now - our initial newgen options are now 25 years old, and with that comes improved consistency. Our newer newgens coming through like Etxabe are mentally stronger and more consistent, and I finally feel like we're getting to a place where we should be thinking about a Champions League each season as the goal.\n\nThat brings us to this season. A La Liga win (just) over Real Madrid was a great reward, however they beat us in the Supercopa final and we lost the Copa Del Rey final to Barcelona. This meant the domestic trophies were shared between the big 3 - no real complaints here - Real Madrid in particular are so strong. In the Champions League a superb group stage saw us finish 2nd and qualify straight into the last 16. We then had chance to exact revenge against Napoli who knocked us out last year - a first leg away saw us go down 1-0 thanks to a Khvaraskelia worldie - neither team created much in that one. We then battered them at San Mames but struggled to score, Alboniga-Menor opened the scoring just after half time to level the tie, and in the 87th minute Jon Martin scored the winner to avoid extra time. Following that we were drawn against Milan in the last 8 - a 3-1 victory at home in the first leg made me feel fairly comfortable going into the second leg, however we got absolutely battered at their place - we lost 1-0 to sneak through 3-2 on aggregate but honestly it should have been more... we could have lost this game badly. We then took on Arsenal in the semi final, again at home in the first leg. We won 1-0 at home thanks to Etxabe, and it could have been more, but ultimately I was happy to take a lead into the second leg. At The Emirates we took a very early lead thanks to a banger from Gorrotxategi in the 2nd minute, from there it was a fairly even game, but they came back into it with a goal on the stroke of half time to make it 1-1 on the night, they then added a second in the 77th minute to level the tie. Extra time was back and forth, unfortunately Julen Agirrezabala went off with a season ending injury in the 90th minute, leaving us with 18 year old third choice keeper Iker Zubillaga in goal as our other option was also injured already). We stayed strong and took the game to penalities. Up step Iker Zubillaga - the 18 year old is our least exciting of 3 young goalkeeper prospects I desperately need to develop, but that didn't stop him from saving 4 penalities in a row to win the shootout! Unreal!\n\nThe final was vs our domestic rivals Real Madrid - they're an unbelievable team...usually neutral grounds they get the better of us, but we beat them at San Mames, so while having a familiar foe was somewhat comforting, I also know how difficult it is to beat them in cup finals at neutral grounds. We start the game really well and take an early lead via an Etxabe header - however the were the better side generally in the game and got an equaliser only 10minutes later via a long range effort. While they did have the slight edge on us in the game it wasn't one sided, and we hit the post in the 115th minute, and then had one blocked on the line 2 minutes later! They also had their chances but just couldn't convert...it went to penalities. The hero of the semi final Zubillaga was not in goal for this one, and in hindsight I wish I'd brought him on - we sadly lost the penalty shootout 4-3... absolutely gutted.\n\nWhile it was a very dissapointing season in that we lost 3 cup finals, we did at least pip Real Madrid to the league title. Overall I'm far more optimistic about this team, I feel like the transition to our newgens has now fully completed and we are mostly through the inconsistency phase. We have a solid group of players who can win stuff now, hopefully that Champions League title isn't far away as this is the longest it's taken me in an Athletic save for sure.\n\nIn transfer news, this season we said goodbye to:\n\nOihan Sancet - 400 league appearances\n\nWhat a legend! Sad to say goodbye to Oihan but it was time, I think next season may be the last for Nico Williams potentially.\n\nWe welcome a few new newgens also to the team - Aitor Etxabe, Xabi Aizpurua, Alex Etxeberria and Carlos Etxeberria (I won't picture Carlos as he's a 2* back up keeper).\n\nGK - Julen Agirrezabala, Carlos Etxeberria, Iker Zubillaga\n\nRB - Unax Urrutia, Alex Etxeberria\n\nLB - Eneko Cordoba, Mikel Guruzeta\n\nCB - Aitor Etxeberria, Josu Blasco, Jose Jimenez, Carlos Saenz\n\nDM - Gaizka Alboniga-Menor, Ibon Marin, Aitor Etxabe, Javi\n\nRW - Jon Ibanez, Jon Castro\n\nLW - Julen Aguirre, Jon Martin\n\nAM - Aitor Gorrotxategi, Xabi Aizpurua\n\nCF - Juan Etxabe, Nico Williams\n\nIn reality the front 4 are fairly interchangeable when rotating, Nico Williams for example fills in everywhere and Gorrotxategi would go into CF if Etxabe was injured.\n\nNow, those new newgens:\n\nHis heading is poor, but with 15 jumping reach he offers something we really lack - a bit of height. I can see him being quite important for us in a DM role.\n\nXabi Aizpurua looks to have a lot of potential, and has done well in his first team appearances this season. He lacks a bit physically but that could improve.\n\nAlex Etxeberria has come on leaps and bounds and is now a great back up for Urrutia at right back, allowing Nico Williams to move further up the pitch again.\n\nGoalkeeper wise, we're hanging on with Julen Agirrezabala, but I have a great prospect in the youth team playing for the B team this season. Hopefully next year he'll be ready.\n\n2033-34 Update - Athletic Club vs Real Madrid\n\nFor the second edition of FM in a row I have a ludicrous rivalry with Real Madrid. For those who didn't follow, or don't remember, in FM23 my rivalry with Real Madrid got to a point where they didn't lose a league game for 2.5 years, and we still shared the La Liga titles over that period - it was epic. We are heading back that way again this year.\n\nOur season started with a tough run of La Liga games: Real Sociedad (A), Barcelona (H), Real Madrid (A) - we beat Real Sociedad but then Barcelona grabbed a 1-1 draw at San Mames (a sign of things to come from them as them embarked on a really strong season), and we then lost our first tie of the season against Real Madrid 2-1. A tough loss after they beat us in the CL final and Club World Cup QF at the tail end of last season. After that we hit our stride - a run of 12 consecutive wins scoring plenty of goals made me very optimistic for the season, however Real Madrid were more than matching us stride for stride - by the time we reached the halfway point of the season Real Madrid had won 17, lost 1. While we were only 2 points behind.\n\nWe then faced Real in the Supercopa final, a chance to get revenge for the recent final losses.... but no - a 3-1 defeat made me feel pretty down about our chances of overhauling them in any competition this season. We then lost again in La Liga to Barcelona to fall 5 points behind Real and I was fearing the worst. But then things changed, starting with a 5-0 battering of Real Sociedad at San Mames, and a 4-0 beating of Osasuna. January was busy with cup ties - a win over Valencia in the Copa Del Rey quarter final gave us a favourable semi final tie against Valladolid, which we won comfortably. In the other semi final, Real Madrid of course - beating Getafe 15-1 on aggregate (lol) - another final showdown awaited us in April.\n\nFebruary and March brought win after win in the league, and a tough draw in the Champions League round of 16 against Arsenal. While we continued to win, so did Real Madrid and the gap at the top of the table remained the same. I noticed also at this stage Barcelona were not going away - having played a few more games, they were still right in the mix although we would go ahead by winning our games in hand. Our match up with Arsenal was a repeat of last seasons CL semi final. We put in a wonderful performance at The Emirates to win 3-2, after being 2-0 down, and then finished the job with a 2-0 victory at San Mames...the 3-2 away was the one that really convinced me we were one of the best teams in Europe, as coming back from 2-0 down away from home against a top side like that is no easy feat. We continued to win in the league throughout March, with a Champions League quarter final vs PSG and Copa Del Rey final in April to look ahead to.\n\nThis season was either going to be the banishing of a lot of ghosts, or the death of this save for me - having lost to PSG in our first Champions League final a few years ago, drawing them in the QF was a big deal. We played the first leg at home and took a deserved 2-0 lead thanks to a couple of late goals from Nico Williams - one of the biggest strengths we had this season was our quality off the bench. We went to Parc Des Princes and played really well, taking a 2-1 victory and seeing off PSG in wonderful fashion.\n\nNext up - a Copa Del Rey final against Madrid. I was conscious that they'd already beaten us in the Supercopa final, we had them here in this one, and they'd also won their Champions League quarter final. Combined with neither team slipping up in the league this felt like it was heading towards a real showdown. We needed to start landing some blows and we did, 2mins into the final Julen Aguirre gave us a 1-0 lead, and we never looked back - in fact we suffocated them. They ended the game with them having 3 shots on goal, 1 on target. A 1-0 win and we were Copa Del Rey champions again.\n\nWe smelt blood in the water - Real had some fixture congestion and after a first leg win against Napoli in the CL SF, they had to go to Elche two days later with a tired team... they lost 1-0... was this it? Were they about the crumble? Well not in the Champions League anyway as they saw off Napoli to book their place in the final. However that took it's toll, as they then lost away at Valencia in the next game - suddenely we'd gone from 5 points back to being right on them (despite a draw we had vs Alaves, and our next game... Real Madrid at San Mames. Barcelona were still there too - they'd won every league game since the start of Feb, but were still a few points behind due to the unreal form of us and Real. We had also comfortably dispatched Porto in our Champions League semi final too by now - apart from a bit of a scare in the first 30mins of the second leg this felt never in doubt - we won 3-0 at San Mames, but they scored 2mins into the second leg and could/should have scored again in the first 30mins, but we held on and then turned the tide, winning 3-1 and 6-1 on aggregate. Once again we lost Julen Agirrezabala to injury in early May - the Champions League final was 3 weeks away and he was borderline to make it. Our next best keeper? A 2* player in Carlos Etxeberria rated as a 'good Liga 2 player' (albeit with a solid attribute spread and high consistency rating). To be fair, Agirrezabala is only 2.5 stars so it's not much of a downgrade - we're still struggling for keepers.\n\nAt this stage in the league:\n\nBarcelona - P36, won 30, draw 5, lost 1 - 95 points\n\nAthletic Club - P34, won 30, draw 2, lost 2 - 92 points\n\nReal Madrid - P34, won 30, lost 4 - 90 points\n\nReal Madrid at San Mames was our chance to twist the knife, and we did. We really did. A 5-1 BATTERING, and Real Madrid were shook - they also lost Vini Jr and Endrick to injury late in the game. We then beat Betis 6-2, a 1-0 win against Espanyol followed, and a 2-0 win against Valencia on the final day saw us take the title. Barcelona kept winning, and they draw 2-2 with Real on the final day to secure 2nd spot - a big improvement from them this season.\n\nThat made it Athletic Club 2 (La Liga, Copa Del Rey) - 1 Real Madrid (Supercopa). With a Champions League final to come. A really competitive title race - hard to believe Real Madrid came third with 97 points haha. Carlos Etxeberria did well in goal over that period - he's a reliable back up.\n\nThe Champions League final, to be played in Kyiv was to be the final showdown, could we put Real Madrid to the sword and comprehensively see them off this season, or would they take another final from us and continue our CL final dissapointments? They were missing Endrick still but Vini Jr was fit enough for the bench, surely this was our chance? Julen Agirrezabala was back in full training the day before the game - aside from some tired legs we were good to go - quite a few of the team were getting jaded, but so were Real.\n\nWe kick off and there's an early highlight... a corner to Athletic Club - delivered by Jon Ibanez to the back post and Eneko Cordoba is there to head home, 1-0 3 minutes in! Is this going to be another battering?? Sadly not - Real Madrid kept it tight and equalised in the 42nd minute. We had been the better side but this game could definitely go either way, and after losing the previous year final on penalties I was still a bit traumatised. A positive team talk at half time and we were back in the ascendancy in the second half - and then a penalty! Jon Ibanez steps up to take and hammers it home to restore our 1 goal lead in the 54th minute. We kept Real Madrid largely subdued and managed to see the game out, with one scary moment leading to a great save from Agirrezabala. And we did it, Champions of Europe!\n\nAfter two lost finals, we finally did it! And we deserved it too, the best team in Europe this season. A treble!\n\nThe trophy cabinet so far:\n\nChampions League - 2034 (runners up 2033, 2031)\n\nLa Liga - 2026, 2029, 2032, 2033, 2034\n\nCopa Del Rey - 2024, 2030, 2034\n\nSupercopa - 2026, 2027, 2029, 2030, 2031\n\nThe Players:\n\nA few specific shout outs first of all:\n\nI've shouted out Juan Etxabe and Aitor Gorrotxategi in recent posts, however these 3 deserve some love - our key players.\n\nSquad wise we've trimmed a bit for the 34/35 season. We allowed Mikel Guruzeta (a wonderful servant) to depart for 46 million - with the emergence of Aitor Aketxe in midfield, and a young left back coming through to cover Cordoba at left back we didn't have much need for Guruzeta anymore. I really like this guy, but it was time to allow him to move - he just lacked the height I wanted in midfield. I was happy to keep him as back up to Cordoba and loan out our left back prospect, but he was going to get unsettled and I couldn't be bothered to deal with it. We then let young prospect Jorge Murillo depart - he looked like he could be a key midfielder for us, but he just never kicked on, and a broken leg hampered his progress. A good loan last season nearly convinced me to keep him, but it felt clear he was not going to displace our current midfielders, and he was another short one like Guruzeta - he moved to Napoli on a cut price deal. We then let Isaac Gomez go - he looked a really good prospect, and in any other save he'd be part of the squad, but our ludicrous forward talents meant we didn't need him as back up. He's moved to Aston Villa. Finally we let go of Gaizka Alboniga-Menor for 44million to Tottenham. A another great servant for us, but again just no room for him. I have retrained Jon Castro to play defensive midfield as a DLP to give us another space for young attacking mids in the squad, and he's our first choice in that position. We have Ibon Marin as back up - he has some issues but is just really effective in our system, and younger also, so he stays.\n\nThe squad (with some embedded screen shots for players not recently featured):\n\nGK - Alberto Etxabe, Julen Agirrezabala, Carlos Etxeberria (Iker Zubillaga out on loan)\n\nClearly this is a problem position. My plan this year was to give Julen/Carlos a rotation - Julen is reliable as is Carlos, and Carlos will benefit from the minutes to maximise his potential - I don't think he gets much better at this stage. Alberto would represent the B team and be third choice. However an early season 6 week injury for Julen convinced me to just throw caution to the wind and throw Alberto in - he looks tidy and I hope he improves quickly. I feel like Alberto with Zubillaga and Carlos backing him up is our long term solution.\n\nRB - Unax Urrutia, Alex Etxebarria\n\nTwo fantastic options here, Alex is a bit more defensive in his approach, Unax is a standout wing back (he came through our academy as a winger and I retrained him)\n\nCB - Aitor Etxebarria, Josu Blasco, Jose Jimenez, Carlos Saenz (Sergio Goti out on loan)\n\nAitor and Josu are our first choice pairing - weak in the air but strong on the ground. Jose Jimenez and Carlos are better in the air, so we do use them to mitigate teams with big aerial threats as best we can.\n\nLB - Eneko Cordoba, Ander Santos\n\nEneko Cordoba is a world class full back and will be our main man for a long time - Ander Santos looks a very capable prospect who will be his back up.\n\nDM (DLP (S)) - Jon Castro, Ibon Marin\n\nJon Castro is an AM retrained to play DM. I identified two key issues with our defensive midfield - 1) We needed a superb ball player in there to play out from the back and get a key pass through to the front 4 - when we played two midfielders not so strong on the ball we struggled against top teams who pressed super high. Jon Castro is our man who can pass and dribble through anything to play the ball out from the back successfully. Marin is very good on the ball also and a very tidy DLP. The second issue was height..\n\nDM (DM(D)) - Aitor Aketxe, Javi\n\nAitor Aketxe has become our functional midfield partner for Castro - well rounded and decent on the ball, but TALL. Javi is good defensively but is prone to being caught in possession and doesn't offer much aerial support for defending in the air.\n\nAM - Aitor Gorrotxategi, Xabi Aizpurua\n\nNot a lot to be said here - Gorrotxategi is quality (no longer inconsistent, yay), and Aizpurua has been an incredibly effective second choice, with room for him to grow.\n\nRW (IW) - Jon Ibanez, Ismael Lafuente\n\nIbanez is super important for us - he plays as an IW but with more risky, direct passing selected. He's a creator with an eye for goal also. Ismael Lafuente - see below.\n\nLW (IF) - Julen Aguirre, Jon Martin\n\nJulen Aguirre is a natural first choice inside forward a world class player. Jon Martin is a top tier player also, and is basically our first off the bench if we need to turn a game around - he's consistent and loves big matches.\n\nCF (AF) - Juan Etxabe, Nico Williams (Inaki Goti out on loan)\n\nEtxabe leads the line, Nico Williams (a bit like Martin) can fill in multiple positions across the front line. Next season Nico will leave on a free at 33 years old, and Inaki will be a more natural advanced forward back up.\n\nWe also have to introduce potentially the best prospect we've had - Ismael Lafuente - he's improved a decent amount but he was already a 2* player when he arrived to Eibar on intake day, so he came in with a very high current ability immediately - he's skipped the B team largely and come straight into the first team squad for the most part, albeit he will play a few B team games this season so I can share game time around for our top players. You can find screens of our other new players embedded above.\n\nAs mentioned previously the big issue we had with this squad came down to:\n\n1) After Simon declined, a lack of goalkeeper quality\n\n2) Centre backs who were good but not great, with limited aerial ability\n\n3) Defensive mids who were good but not great, with limited aerial ability.\n\nWe couldn't easily resolve 1, but Julen Agirrezabala is at least a very reliable option. For 2 and 3, Josu Blasco and Aitor Etxeberria weren't suddenly going to get a few inches taller, but they have improved as players and offer a very solid centre back pairing. In defensive midfield, this is where we've made the biggest improvement - retraining Jon Castro to be our DLP has been a masterstroke - having that type of ball playing quality working the ball out of defense is so important to our system. We then needed to pair him with someone who has a bit of height, but also decent ball playing abilities - Javi did not progress really at all from about 19 years of age, and he's another small guy. Aitor Aketxe has been a key influence, even if he's not the best overall player - he just has the right attributes for what we needed.\n\nI've had a few weeks off work and will be slowing down with the updates now\n\nEdited February 13 by bowieinspace\n\nIt's been a while since I've done a season update. I tried a few other saves but nothing is quite like an Athletic Club save. I'm not even sure I posted an update on my 2027-28 season - we finished second behind Real (their fourth title in a row).\n\n2028-29 Season Review: Double Winners!\n\nLa Liga: 1st (+1) - 95 points (+5)\n\nCopa Del Rey: W (beat Osasuna 2-0 in final)\n\nSuper Cup: F (lost to Real Madrid)\n\nChampions League: Knockout Play Off Round (lost to Barcelona)\n\nOur most successful season so far, winning our first two trophies of the save, including La Liga. Real Madrid were ahead for most of the season but surprisingly slipped up a couple of times in the final few weeks, so we went into the last day of the season with a one point lead. We were away to Sevilla, which was a potentially tricky tie. Luckily the fixture computer did me a favour as Real were away to Barcelona. Anyway, as long as we did our job, it didn't matter what happened at the Camp Nou. Well, we were absolutely hammered 3-0 with our defence getting nervous and losing the ball in dangerous positions, and a clinical Sevilla forward line just picked us off. Luckily, Barcelona took an early lead and I was just crossing my fingers than they'd hold on - which they did! So, not the victory lap I'd have liked, but the title was ours nevertheless.\n\nThe Super Cup was a familiar tale - play Real in the final and lose. However, we beat Real in the QF of the Spanish Cup and despatched Villareal in the SF. Playing Osasuna in the final was very kind and it was a routine victory. Champions League was a bit of write-off as Barcelona demolished us at home, which left us too much to do in the return leg.\n\nSquad Performance\n\nWe'd played a 4-3-3-0 for most of the save but the emergence of a potentially world class striker (Bittor Casado) as a real attacking focal point meant we changed to my preferred 4-3-2-1. We're starting to see some regens in the first team squad too - with Javi Jimenez, Oier Benito and Casado amongst my strongest performers. I'll share some screenshots of the next generation of talent below.\n\nPeio Huestamendia has become a really good wide option in my save - it'll be interested to see whether anyone's got anything from him. Unai Vencedor was a rotation option too, and most of the rest of the squad are other regens too.\n\nTransfers\n\nIn the 27-28 season, the main signing was Kepa to strengthen the GK positions (700k!) whilst I had sold Alvaro Fernandez, Laporte, Djalo and Moncayola for around 80m combined.\n\nThis season had few incomings - Merino came in for around 50m (even at 32 he's world class) and otherwise just other Basque regens. Le Normand went back to Saudi Arabia and we sold an unhappy Aimar Vicandi to Southampton for 25m (max of 30m with add-ons). We've reached the point now where we will only sign regens and just sell off the ageing original players.\n\nYouth Development\n\nThis is really starting to pay off now. I have SEVEN wonderkids - a goalkeeper, FOUR defenders, and two attackers. Screenshots below!\n\nAnd then there is a huge amount of talent waiting to come through. If they're not ready for first team action or I'm already strong in their positions, then loans really accelerate their development. And we're likely to be strong in all areas going forward as we've had players come through in all positions.\n\nXabi Jimenez (GK)\n\n(HG) denotes home grown btw (and ** is just an internal note for me to watch them)! Xabi joined us in 24-25 and has spent two seasons on loan at St Etienne and the last season at Getafe in La Liga (they were relegated but he performed well). Hopefully he gets a bit stronger over the next few seasons but his raw goalkeeping ability is excellent. He will probably stay on loan for another season as we have Agirrezabala and Kepa - hopefully in La Liga again.\n\nJavi Jimenez (RB)\n\nAnother player from the 24-25 intake, he's really kicked on over the last year as our first choice RB - hopefully he can develop those technical stats more.\n\nOier Benito (DL/DR/DC)\n\nA versatile defender who can play anywhere across the backline - I'd see him more as a CB in the first instance, but he can deputise in the full back positions when needed. He cost 20k from Burlades (a Navarre-based club in the fifth tier).\n\nCarlos Acosta (DC)\n\nThe best of the defensive wonderkids, I think. He was pretty much my first-choice CB this season. He cost 135k from Laredo, a fifth-tier side (which is not in the Basque country but he is Basque) and will be capped by Spain soon.\n\nAlejandro Larrazabal (DC)\n\nI'm surprised he's a wonderkid really as his potential isn't quite as high as those above, but he will be a solid CB option to come. He's been on loan twice in the Championship and also in the second division in Spain - all of these have helped him progress.\n\nBittor Casado (ST)\n\nOur first-choice striker and if he could improve aerially, he'd be frightening! But give him a sniff in the box and he'll score. Great mental stats too - perhaps a potential captain? Cost 20k from Huarte, another Navarre-based side in the fifth tier. I've really lucked out with regens coming through the lower divisions that can make the grade.\n\nEduardo Martinez (ST/AMR)\n\nIt took ages for a decent striker to emerge, and now I have two wonderkids up front. Eduardo cost 875k from Alaves at the age of 16, and he's had loans in Spain, France and England, hitting the net with regularity. The other good thing about Eduardo is that he can play AMR and he'll probably alternate playing up top with playing as an inside forward.\n\nI could bombard you with screenshots of other players, but I'll wait until they become wonderkids. There are probably 7-8 guys with 5* potential and then loads more between 4-4.5*so we're spoilt for choice really.\n\nThe next players to transition out will be Guillamon, Vivian, Aihen Munoz, and Vencedor. One of the two CBs may leave this Summer, Munoz almost certainly will and I'll take good offers for Vencedor as he's become a bit of a prat to manage. Sancet is 29 but still has a few years at this level.\n\nNext season, I hope we'll make a better crack at the CL.\n\n2034/35 Season Review - Defending European Champions\n\nLa Liga - 1st, 105 points (new La Liga record)\n\nCopa Del Rey - Lost in final to Real Madrid\n\nSupercopa - Lost in semi-final (penalties) to Atletico\n\nUEFA Super Cup - Winners, beat Juventus in final\n\nChampions League - Winners!\n\nAn excellent season as defending European Champions, firstly taking the Super Cup curtain raiser vs Juventus comfortably. We blitzed La Liga, winning 35 and losing 3 to score 105 points. Our losses game away to Valencia in the penultimate game of the season (heavily rotated team), and losses away to Barca and home to Real Madrid in games which could have gone either way. In the Copa Del Rey we had a superb semi final comeback against Barcelona to set up a final with Real, however superstar Julen Aguirre got himself sent off in the first half and we went on to lose 1-0. We rotated in the Supercopa and although being the better side, eventually lost on penalties in the semi final vs Atletico.\n\nThe Champions League defence was an impressive one, topping the league phase with 7 wins and 1 draw, the draw being away at Arsenal on the final day when we rotated our team, with wins vs Man City, Juve, PAOK, Rennes, Sporting CP, Club Brugge and Bayern (the latter a 5-1 pasting). Straight into the round of 16 and a draw against Juventus - a 0-0 at their place set us up nicely for the home leg and we saw them away 4-1. We then met Arsenal in the quarter final, a team who have caused us some issues in the past... the first leg at San Mames was comfortable and we scored 5 - unfortunately a late penalty made it 5-2 to give them a sniff at home if things went their way. However we held strong in the second leg despite being the worse team on the night, 0-0 through until the last minute when they got a late consolation goal giving us an overall 5-3 victory. We then moved onto a semi final against Man City - a tough first leg at their ground saw us run back to San Mames with a fortunate 2-3 defeat - it could have been worse so I was very happy to be in touching distance for the home leg. We then took control in the second leg with two first half goals to see us lead on aggregate, only for an equaliser against the run of play meaning we went to extra time. It came down to a bizarre lobbed header from young star Ismael Lafuente to see us take the lead, and the win in extra time. We then had a final against Bayern, meaning we had the odd coincidence of playing every knockout round against a team we'd played against in the league phase. We'd battered them 5-1 at San Mames in that phase, so I was optimistic going into the final, even with a squad plagued by injuries - over the last few months of the season we'd lost our starting keeper for 4 months, star player Jon Ibanez to a cruciate ligament tear for 9 months, Jon Martin (first back up in the forward areas) for a month (return date a few days after the Champions League final) and Unax Urrutia (starting RB) with a similar injury/timeline. We also lost Julen Aguirre, our other star winger on the opposite side to Ibanez, and he was set to return a few days before the final. We'd also lost our backup LB, back up striker for 3-4 weeks in April, and Juan Etxabe our starting striker for a month in April, meaning during the semi finals and league run in we had hardly any options to rotate players. By the time the final rolled around we were still missing Ibanez (out until Christmas), Unax Urrutia and Jon Martin, but we were otherwise mostly healthy... just a couple players still not fully match fit.\n\nWe kicked off the final to an immediate highlight - Alex Etxebarria our right back running down the line, beating his man and putting in a low cross which was turned in for an own goal 16 seconds into the final! We didn't look back from there and despite them equalising midway through the first half, we went on to win 4-1 and defend our Champions League crown!\n\nSquad Building\n\nNo transfers of significance really, we did let Mikel Guruzeta, Isaac Gomez, Carlos Saenz and Jorge Murillo all leave as they were surplus to requirements - decent money for them but given we have 600million GBP in the bank I don't worry about transfer fees and just try to find good moves for my players now. By far the most significant departure though was on a free transfer - we have said goodbye to Nico Williams who has just turned 33 - he hasn't declined much (he has a bit but he was still a 4* player), however he wanted star player status still on a multi year new deal and he's not a starter anymore due to the insane level of Etxabe, Gorrotxategi, Aguirre and Ibanez - we allowed him to leave on a free after 17 odd years at the club and 452 league appearances. A wonderful servant to the club. That means we now have no real players left at the club - a full team of newgens.\n\nGk -\n\nAlberto Etxabe (Academy graduate, from Barakaldo)\n\nIker Zubillaga (Academy graduate, from Vitoria)\n\nCarlos Etxeberria (Tenerife academy, from Estella-Lizarra in Navarro)\n\nRb -\n\nUnax Urrutia (Academy graduate, from Portugalete)\n\nAlex Etxebarria (Academy graduate, from Galdakao)\n\nLb -\n\nEneko Cordoba (Arenas Club graduate, from Getxo)\n\nAnder Santos (Academy graduate, from Azpeitia)\n\nCb -\n\nAitor Etxebarria (Academy graduate, from Bilbao)\n\nJosu Blasco (Academy graduate, from Leioa)\n\nJosu Jimenez (Academy graduate, from Sestao)\n\nSergio Goti (Academy graduate, from Vitoria)\n\nDm -\n\nJavi (Academy graduate, from Bilbao)\n\nAitor Aketxe (Academy graduate, from Bilbao)\n\nJon Castro (Academy graduate, from Sestao)\n\nIbon Marin (Academy graduate, from Basauri, also French Basque)\n\nAm -\n\nAitor Gorrotxategi (Academy graduate, from Galdakao)\n\nXabi Aizpurua (Academy graduate, from Vitoria)\n\nRw -\n\nJon Ibanez (Academy graduate, from Erandio)\n\nJon Martin (Academy graduate, from Bilbao)\n\nLw -\n\nJulen Aguirre (Real Sociedad graduate, from San Sebastian, also French Basque)\n\nIsmael Lafuente (Eibar graduate, from Eibar)\n\nCf -\n\nJuan Etxabe (Academy graduate, from Ermua)\n\nInaki Goti (Academy graduate, from Bilbao)"
