Classification of dynamical states\n\nS. Véliz Astudillo 11 E. R. Carrasco 22 J. L. Nilo Castellón 11 A. Zenteno 33 H. Cuevas 11\n\nAbstract\n\nContext. While the influence of galaxy clusters on galaxy evolution is relatively well-understood, the impact of the dynamical states of these clusters is less clear. This paper series explores how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters affects their galaxy populations’ physical and morphological properties.\n\nAims. The primary aim of this first paper is to evaluate the dynamical state of 87 massive (M500≥1.5×1014⁢M⊙subscript𝑀5001.5superscript1014subscript𝑀direct-productM_{500}\\geq 1.5\\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≥ 1.5 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) galaxy clusters at low redshifts (0.10≤z≤0.350.10𝑧0.350.10\\leq z\\leq 0.350.10 ≤ italic_z ≤ 0.35). This will allow us to have a well-characterized sample for analyzing physical and morphological properties in our next work.\n\nMethods. We employ six dynamical state proxies utilizing optical and X-ray imaging data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to integrate these proxies effectively, allowing for robust classification of galaxy clusters into relaxed, intermediate, and disturbed states based on their dynamical characteristics.\n\nResults. The methodology successfully segregates the galaxy clusters into the three dynamical states. Examination of the galaxy distributions in optical wavelengths and gas distributions in X-ray further confirms the consistency of these classifications. The clusters’ dynamical states are statistically distinguishable, providing a clear categorization for further analysis.\n\nKey Words.:\n\ngalaxy clusters – dynamical states – galaxy evolution\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the context of the standard cosmological model Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛΛ\\Lambdaroman_ΛCDM), small fluctuations in the initial density field are amplified by gravity, collapsing into dark matter halos, transitioning from a linear to a nonlinear regime (Molnar, 2016). Following the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation, mergers with similarly sized systems and smooth accretions of smaller structures lead to the formation of galaxy clusters (Kravtsov & Borgani, 2012), which are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe.\n\nDue to their formation processes, galaxy clusters can exist in various dynamical states. These range from systems close to virialization to highly perturbed systems resulting from large-scale interactions. According to the ΛΛ\\Lambdaroman_ΛCDM cosmological model and observations, around 30%-80% of clusters are in non-relaxed states, exhibiting notable substructures in optical and X-ray images (e.g., Dressler & Shectman, 1988; Santos et al., 2008; Fakhouri et al., 2010) and merger features in radio images (e.g., Skillman et al., 2013; Golovich et al., 2019)\n\nGalaxy clusters in a relaxed dynamical state are crucial for studying various astrophysical aspects. For instance, they allow us to investigate the advanced stages of structure evolution in the Universe, providing insight into how galaxy clusters have evolved from their initial states to their current form (e.g., Voit, 2005). Additionally, due to their higher degrees of symmetry, these systems are ideal for studying dark matter density profiles through gravitational lensing (e.g., Umetsu et al., 2014). Furthermore, since the hot gas forming the intracluster medium (ICM) tends to be in hydrostatic equilibrium in relaxed clusters, more precise studies of its temperature and density distribution can be conducted, offering valuable information about gas physics and cooling history (e.g., Vikhlinin et al., 2006). Moreover, considering that relaxed clusters exhibiting strong gravitational lensing are more numerous than their disturbed counterparts, they are ideal systems for studying high-redshift galaxies that are magnified by this effect. (e.g., Bayliss et al., 2011; Bouwens et al., 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, non-relaxed clusters offer different aspects of the study. These systems provide insights into the processes of large-scale structure formation in the Universe, such as merger dynamics or shock waves and cold fronts (e.g., Markevitch et al., 2002; Poole et al., 2006; Owers et al., 2014). Additionally, interactions within galaxy clusters can displace dark matter and ICM components, offering an ideal scenario for studying both components and their interactions (e.g., Clowe et al., 2006; Jee et al., 2014). Moreover, galaxy cluster merger scenarios can be helpful in the field of particle physics to constrain the cross-section of self-interacting dark matter particles (e.g., Harvey et al., 2015) and in cosmology, providing essential tests for the standard ΛΛ\\Lambdaroman_ΛCDM cosmological model (e.g., Thompson et al., 2015).\n\nVarious proxies have been used to classify systems according to their dynamical states. For example, in the projected sky plane, the cluster morphology in radio images has been utilized (e.g., Cassano et al., 2010), as well as the galaxy density distribution (e.g., Wen & Han, 2015), the surface brightness distribution in X-rays (e.g., Jeltema et al., 2005; Nurgaliev et al., 2013), and the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak/centroid (e.g., Mann & Ebeling, 2012; Zenteno et al., 2020). In addition, to identify cluster mergers along the line of sight, the shape of the velocity distribution has also been used as a proxy (e.g., Ribeiro et al., 2013; de Los Rios et al., 2016; Carrasco et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, one of the most fundamental aspects of galaxy clusters is that they are ideal laboratories for studying galaxy evolution. These are the highest-density environments in the Universe’s large-scale structure, where specific physical processes accelerate galaxy evolution, leading to morphological transformations, environmental quenching, and preferential galaxy distributions. Although differences in physical and morphological properties between clusters and the field or other low-density environments are well studied, the effect of the dynamical state of galaxy clusters on their member galaxies is not entirely clear. Ribeiro et al. (2013) found that the faint end of the luminosity function is more pronounced in relaxed clusters than in disturbed systems at lower redshift (z≤0.1𝑧0.1z\\leq 0.1italic_z ≤ 0.1) in clusters with M>1014⁢M⊙𝑀superscript1014subscript𝑀direct-productM>10^{14}M_{\\odot}italic_M > 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. However, (Zenteno et al., 2020) found results that were in disagreement. By studying a sample of 288 massive galaxy clusters (M200>4×1014subscript𝑀2004superscript1014M_{200}>4\\times 10^{14}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 200 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 4 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M⊙) with multiwavelength information, they found that the luminosity function does not show statistically significant differences between relaxed and disturbed clusters at low redshift (z≲0.55less-than-or-similar-to𝑧0.55z\\lesssim 0.55italic_z ≲ 0.55). However, at a higher redshift (z≳0.55greater-than-or-equivalent-to𝑧0.55z\\gtrsim 0.55italic_z ≳ 0.55), disturbed clusters exhibit a more pronounced faint end slope than their relaxed counterparts. It was hypothesized that galaxy cluster populations show differences between relaxed and disturbed clusters at z≳0.55greater-than-or-equivalent-to𝑧0.55z\\gtrsim 0.55italic_z ≳ 0.55, which was corroborated by Aldás et al. (2023), at least in the color-magnitude relation of these systems.\n\nIn this series of two papers, we aim to investigate the impact of the dynamical state of massive clusters (M500≥1.5×1014subscript𝑀5001.5superscript1014M_{500}\\geq 1.5\\times 10^{14}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≥ 1.5 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M⊙) on the physical and morphological properties of their member galaxies, in the redshift range 0.10<z<0.350.10𝑧0.350.10<z<0.350.10 < italic_z < 0.35. In this first paper, our aim is to detail the sample selection and use optical data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 10 (LS DR10) and X-ray data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives to determine the dynamic state of the clusters. The calculation of the physical and morphological properties of the galaxies, as well as the analysis of the impact of the dynamical state on these galaxy populations, will be presented in a second article (Véliz Astudillo et al., 2024, in preparation, hereafter Paper II).\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the sample selection process. In Section 3, we detail the method used to assign cluster memberships, followed by the approach used to select the BCGs in Section 4. We define the dynamical state proxies in Section 5. In Section 6, we classify the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, explaining the chosen method. We discuss the results and present the conclusions in Section 7.\n\nThroughout this work, we adopt a flat ΛΛ\\Lambdaroman_ΛCDM cosmology, asumming H0=69.3subscript𝐻069.3H_{0}=69.3italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 69.3 km s-1, ΩΛ=0.721subscriptΩΛ0.721\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.721roman_Ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Λ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.721 and Ωm=0.287subscriptΩ𝑚0.287\\Omega_{m}=0.287roman_Ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.287 (WMAP-9, Hinshaw et al., 2013). Unless specifically stated, the magnitudes used in this article are quoted in the AB system.\n\n2 Data\n\n2.1 DESI Legacy Survey Data Release 10\n\nThe DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (Legacy Survey, LS) is the result of the efforts of three different surveys that provide images and catalogs, initially planned for the g𝑔gitalic_g, r𝑟ritalic_r, and z𝑧zitalic_z filters. On the one hand, there are surveys in the northern hemisphere (δ≳32greater-than-or-equivalent-to𝛿32\\delta\\gtrsim 32italic_δ ≳ 32); these include the Beijing Arizona Sky Survey (BASS, Zou et al., 2017), which provides photometric information in the g𝑔gitalic_g and r𝑟ritalic_r bands using the Bok 2.3 m Telescope, and the Mayall z𝑧zitalic_z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS, Silva et al., 2016). On the other hand, for the southern hemisphere, there is the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS, Blum et al., 2016), which makes use of the DECam instrument mounted on the Victor Blanco 4 m Telescope in the g𝑔gitalic_g, r𝑟ritalic_r, and z𝑧zitalic_z filters. It is worth mentioning that DECaLS is primarily composed of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES, The Dark Energy Survey Collaboration, 2005), with the remaining data obtained from the public DECam data, available in the NOIRLab online repository. Among these earlier programs, the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE, Drlica-Wagner et al., 2022), and the DECam eROSITA Survey (DeROSITAS; PI: Zenteno). The initial goal of LS was to select targets for the upcoming DESI Spectroscopic Survey, whose spectrograph will be installed on the 4m Mayall Telescope, precisely where the MzLS is conducted.\n\nThe latest data release (LS DR10) included DECam i𝑖iitalic_i band data. Combined, all images from LS DR10 cover more than 20,000 square degrees of the sky, with the three surveys having similar observational design properties. In each filter, a uniform depth of 5⁢σ5𝜎5\\sigma5 italic_σ is reached at mg=24.7subscript𝑚𝑔24.7m_{g}=24.7italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_g end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 24.7, mr=23.9subscript𝑚𝑟23.9m_{r}=23.9italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 23.9, mz=23.0subscript𝑚𝑧23.0m_{z}=23.0italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 23.0, which is typically ∼1similar-toabsent1\\sim 1∼ 1 magnitude deeper than Pan-STARRS (Duncan, 2022). Detailed descriptions of source detection and photometry can be found in Dey et al. (2019, and references therein).\n\nOn the official LS DR10 website , catalogs and images are available. Regarding the catalogs, they were generated using the software The Tractor (Lang et al., 2016). This code employs a probabilistic method to fit surface brightness models to the sources in an image. The models can be point sources (PSF), round exponential galaxies with variable radius (REX), de Vaucouleurs (DEV) profiles (elliptical galaxies), exponential (EXP) profiles (spiral galaxies), and Sersic (SER) profiles, and these are fitted employing a χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT minimization problem. It is worth noting that in addition to optical data, the catalogs also include infrared information from the WISE five-year co-added image, also known as unWISE (Wright et al., 2010), in the W⁢1𝑊1W1italic_W 1, W⁢2𝑊2W2italic_W 2, W⁢3𝑊3W3italic_W 3, and W⁢4𝑊4W4italic_W 4 bands. Concerning the images, we utilized science images, weight images, exposure number maps, and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) maps.\n\n2.2 Chandra and XMM-Newton archive images\n\nThe X-ray images used in this study were obtained from the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives. However, it is important to note that the entire process, from the downloading of the images to their uniform processing and availability in repositories, was carried out by other authors and is accessible to the scientific community. Specifically, Yuan & Han (2020) initiated their project to evaluate the dynamical state of galaxy clusters based on the morphology of the X-ray surface brightness distribution, revealing the behaviors of the ICM in these systems. In their study, they explain that the Chandra satellite has observed approximately ∼1000similar-toabsent1000\\sim 1000∼ 1000 galaxy clusters, and the high resolution of its images is ideal for detecting substructures in the ICM. They processed the data from these structures by filtering photons with energies in the 0.5−--5.0 keV range, carefully removing flares and point sources, and smoothing the images with a Gaussian kernel at a physical scale of 30 kpc. Initially, these scales varied for each cluster due to their different redshifts.\n\nSubsequently, Yuan et al. (2022) expanded their previous work, this time including data from ∼1300similar-toabsent1300\\sim 1300∼ 1300 XMM-Newton systems and 22 new Chandra-observed clusters in the period between their two studies. The processing of X-ray images was the same for consistency, resulting in a total of 1844 galaxy clusters between the two studies. In addition, parameters were calculated for all these clusters to approximate their dynamical states, which will be detailed in Section 3.3. Thus, the final data products, consisting of images and catalogs, are publicly available on the authors’ web repository .\n\n2.3 Redshift catalogs\n\nThis study uses the photometric redshift catalog from Wen & Han (2022). Using data from the DES and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE Wright et al., 2010), they estimated the photometric redshifts of 105 million galaxies, employing clustering algorithms to identify 151,244 galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.1<z<1.50.1𝑧1.50.1<z<1.50.1 < italic_z < 1.5. The algorithms used are explained in detail in (Wen & Han, 2021). In summary, the authors used publicly available DES DR2 data in the g⁢r⁢i⁢z⁢Y𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑌grizYitalic_g italic_r italic_i italic_z italic_Y bands (Abbott et al., 2021) and unWISE data in the W⁢1𝑊1W1italic_W 1 and W⁢2𝑊2W2italic_W 2 filters. The match between both databases results in 105 million objects. Then, photometric redshifts were derived on the basis of colors using the nearest-neighbors algorithm with respect to the spectroscopic redshifts of a robust training sample. Specifically, the distances from the target galaxies to all training galaxies in the multidimensional color space (g−r𝑔𝑟g-ritalic_g - italic_r, r−i𝑟𝑖r-iitalic_r - italic_i, i−z𝑖𝑧i-zitalic_i - italic_z, z−y𝑧𝑦z-yitalic_z - italic_y, y−W⁢1𝑦𝑊1y-W1italic_y - italic_W 1, and W⁢1−W⁢2𝑊1𝑊2W1-W2italic_W 1 - italic_W 2) were calculated. Then, the 20 nearest neighbors were selected to compute the photometric redshift. This was calculated as the mean value of these 20 neighbors with spectroscopic redshift and the error was calculated as the standard deviation among them. This methodology is based on the premise that the color of galaxies is closely related to their redshifts when covering spectral features such as the 4000Å break or the Balmer jump. Galaxies close to the multidimensional color space generally have similar redshifts (Wen & Han, 2021).\n\nWe conducted an exhaustive literature search to find galaxy clusters with spectroscopic information in their respective fields. The selection process of these systems is detailed in Section 2.4, and Table 1 shows the sources from which the spectroscopic information was obtained.\n\nFig. 1 shows the comparison between the photometric redshifts obtained from the catalogs of Wen & Han (2022) and the spectroscopic redshifts obtained in the literature for the member galaxies of the clusters. We define Δ⁢znorm=(zphot−zspec)/(1+zspec)Δsubscript𝑧normsubscript𝑧photsubscript𝑧spec1subscript𝑧spec\\Delta z_{\\text{norm}}=(z_{\\text{phot}}-z_{\\text{spec}})/(1+z_{\\text{spec}})roman_Δ italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT norm end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT spec end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) / ( 1 + italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT spec end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). We found a mean value of Δ⁢znorm=0.005Δsubscript𝑧norm0.005\\Delta z_{\\text{norm}}=0.005roman_Δ italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT norm end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.005 with a dispersion of σz=0.02subscript𝜎z0.02\\sigma_{\\text{z}}=0.02italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.02, using robust biweight estimators.\n\n2.4 Sample selection\n\nIf we want to study the effect of cluster dynamics on the morphology of their member galaxies, having a robust and homogeneous sample is crucial. To achieve this, we performed a 2-arcminute radius cross-match between the galaxy clusters identified in the optical by Wen & Han (2022) and those in X-rays found in the Chandra (Yuan & Han, 2020) and XMM-Newton (Yuan et al., 2022) archives, resulting in 471 systems.\n\nThen, we selected those galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.10<z<0.350.10𝑧0.350.10<z<0.350.10 < italic_z < 0.35, resulting in 152 clusters. At this point, Abell 3827 is added, which is at z∼0.099similar-to𝑧0.099z\\sim 0.099italic_z ∼ 0.099, and we have access to spectroscopic information. The lower limit is chosen mainly because of the extensive spatial coverage required for nearby clusters. Regarding the upper limit, we rely on the work of de Albernaz Ferreira & Ferrari (2018), demonstrating that reliable morphological studies can be performed using DECam up to z∼0.4similar-to𝑧0.4z\\sim 0.4italic_z ∼ 0.4. However, we decided to be conservative and study up to the mentioned limit. Furthermore, within this interval, it ensures that we cover the 4000 Å break using the (g−r)𝑔𝑟(g-r)( italic_g - italic_r ) color index to separate early-type red galaxies from star-forming objects (e.g. Bruzual A., 1983; Nilo Castellón et al., 2014). Moreover, within this redshift range, the LS DR10 achieves enough photometric depth to conduct homogeneous studies up to three magnitudes fainter than the characteristic magnitude (m∗+3subscript𝑚3m_{*}+3italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + 3) of all clusters in the sample.\n\nSubsequently, to ensure that the matching of clusters between optical and X-ray databases is not affected by projection effects, we impose the condition that zx−zphot/(1+zx)≤0.05subscript𝑧𝑥subscript𝑧phot1subscript𝑧𝑥0.05z_{x}-z_{\\text{phot}}/(1+z_{x})\\leq 0.05italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / ( 1 + italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ≤ 0.05, where zxsubscript𝑧𝑥z_{x}italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the redshift found in the X-ray catalogs of Yuan & Han (2020) and Yuan et al. (2022), while zphotsubscript𝑧photz_{\\text{phot}}italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the photometric redshift estimated for the clusters identified in the optical wavelengths by Wen & Han (2022), resulting in 119 galaxy clusters. Next, we remove from the sample all systems that are very poor and low-mass by applying the condition λ≥30𝜆30\\lambda\\geq 30italic_λ ≥ 30 and M500≥1.5×1014⁢M⊙subscript𝑀5001.5superscript1014subscript𝑀direct-productM_{500}\\geq 1.5\\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≥ 1.5 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⊙ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where λ𝜆\\lambdaitalic_λ is the cluster richness estimated based on overdensities and fluctuations in the field, and M500subscript𝑀500M_{500}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the mass of the clusters estimated within R500subscript𝑅500R_{500}italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, with calculations detailed in Wen & Han (2022). Finally, the last filter was to exclude from the sample, via visual inspection, all systems with field contamination due to a saturated star or lack of photometric information in the LS catalogs. Our final sample consists of 87 massive galaxy clusters.\n\n3 Cluster membership\n\nThe most unequivocal way to select member galaxies of a cluster is by using spectroscopic redshifts. However, for our sample, less than half of the clusters have catalogs of this nature available in the literature or databases such as NED or Vizier . Additionally, there is the difficulty of the few systems with this information not sharing the same observational designs. For example, some systems have more than 1,000 galaxies with spectroscopic data in the field due to the use of integral field spectroscopy (e.g., Mercurio et al., 2021) or multiobject spectroscopy (e.g., Owers et al., 2011). In contrast, others have fewer than 20 objects due to the use of a few slits, mainly selecting galaxies that are on the Red Sequences (RS) in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of the clusters (e.g., Bayliss et al., 2016). Additionally, there are differences in sky coverage and/or limit magnitudes. These differences can directly affect sample analyses, leading to biased results due to inhomogeneities. However, this can be addressed by homogeneously assigning membership to the entire sample using photometric redshifts.\n\nIn this way, we follow a probabilistic method whose foundations were established by Brunner & Lubin (2000) and later developed by Pelló et al. (2009). The procedure consists of calculating the probability Pmembersubscript𝑃memberP_{\\text{member}}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT member end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that a galaxy is a member of a cluster at redshift zclsubscript𝑧clz_{\\text{cl}}italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT within a redshift slice δzsubscript𝛿𝑧\\delta_{z}italic_δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.\n\nPmember=∫zcl−δzzcl+δzP⁢(z)⁢𝑑z.subscript𝑃membersuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑧clsubscript𝛿𝑧subscript𝑧clsubscript𝛿𝑧𝑃𝑧differential-d𝑧P_{\\text{member}}=\\int_{z_{\\text{cl}}-\\delta_{z}}^{z_{\\text{cl}}+\\delta_{z}}P(% z)dz.italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT member end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ∫ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_P ( italic_z ) italic_d italic_z .

To determine σbwsubscript𝜎bw\\sigma_{\\text{bw}}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bw end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we used all galaxies with available spectroscopic redshifts (see Table 1) to compare them with photometric redshifts, obtaining a mean residual of (zspec−zphot)/(1+zspec)=0.008subscript𝑧specsubscript𝑧phot1subscript𝑧spec0.008(z_{\\text{spec}}-z_{\\text{phot}})/(1+z_{\\text{spec}})=0.008( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT spec end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) / ( 1 + italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT spec end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = 0.008. The robust biweight scale estimator (Beers et al., 1990) resulted in σbw=0.02subscript𝜎bw0.02\\sigma_{\\text{bw}}=0.02italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bw end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.02.\n\nP⁢(z)𝑃𝑧P(z)italic_P ( italic_z ) is the galaxy photometric redshift probability distribution. This distribution has been discussed in the literature, which does not have to be Gaussian; instead, it can have multiple peaks or extended tails (Pelló et al., 2009). For this reason, the photometric redshift distributions provided as output in codes that calculate this value have been used in other works (e.g., De Lucia et al., 2004; Vulcani et al., 2012; Kesebonye et al., 2023). These distributions are usually obtained using algorithms that involve fitting SEDs to a library of templates. However, we do not have this information; we only have the photometric redshift information and its corresponding error. Thus, we approximate this distribution as a Gaussian with μ=zphot𝜇subscript𝑧phot\\mu=z_{\\text{phot}}italic_μ = italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and σ=zphot,err𝜎subscript𝑧photerr\\sigma=z_{\\text{phot},\\text{err}}italic_σ = italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT phot , err end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Although we recognize the mentioned disadvantages, at least we consider the measurement error, and it is feasible to apply this probabilistic method instead of making a simple selection within a photometric redshift slice.\n\nThe method requires a calibration of Pmembersubscript𝑃memberP_{\\text{member}}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT member end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with spectroscopic data, which, in turn, allows the calculation of the completeness of cluster member galaxies and contamination by field galaxies. This calibration was performed using clusters that have spectroscopic redshifts for a large number of both member and field galaxies, specifically Abell 267, Abell 383, Abell 2537, Abell 2631, Abell 2744, Abell S1063, and RBS 1748. Spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies were calculated using |zcl−zspec|<3⁢σcl⁢(1+zcl)subscript𝑧clsubscript𝑧spec3subscript𝜎cl1subscript𝑧cl|z_{\\text{cl}}-z_{\\text{spec}}|<3\\sigma_{\\text{cl}}(1+z_{\\text{cl}})| italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT spec end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | < 3 italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( 1 + italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), where σclsubscript𝜎cl\\sigma_{\\text{cl}}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT cl end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the velocity dispersion of the cluster.\n\nWe identified 1,041 member galaxies and 1,328 galaxies that do not belong to the mentioned clusters. In Fig. 2, the completeness and contamination fractions can be observed for a range of Pthresholdsubscript𝑃thresholdP_{\\text{threshold}}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT threshold end_POSTSUBSCRIPT values. We explored 100 variations for this parameter, from 0 to 1, in steps of 0.01. With this calibration, we decided to use the value of Pthreshold=0.65subscript𝑃threshold0.65P_{\\text{threshold}}=0.65italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT threshold end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.65, ensuring a completeness of at least 80% and contamination below 25%.\n\n4 BCG selection\n\nIdentifying the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) is crucial for estimating the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. This work selects the BCG using an automatic method and visual inspection.\n\nThe automatic method involves selecting the brightest cluster member galaxy within ±1⁢σplus-or-minus1𝜎\\pm 1\\sigma± 1 italic_σ of the best fit to the red cluster sequence in the normalized color-magnitude diagram of each galaxy cluster. Several studies have shown that the evolution of the characteristic magnitude m∗superscript𝑚m^{*}italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for galaxy cluster populations can be described by a stellar population formed at high redshift that evolves passively (e.g., de Propris et al., 1999; Andreon, 2006; Stalder et al., 2013). This has been reproduced over a broad redshift range (0≲z≲1less-than-or-similar-to0𝑧less-than-or-similar-to10\\lesssim z\\lesssim 10 ≲ italic_z ≲ 1) for massive clusters (Zenteno et al., 2016, 2020). To model m∗superscript𝑚m^{*}italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, we created red sequence composite stellar populations (CSP) for the DECam griz bands using Bruzual & Charlot (2003) SSP models via the Python code EzGal (Mancone & Gonzalez, 2012). Specifically, we assumed an exponentially declining star formation rate with a characteristic decay time of 0.4 Gyr, the Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), and a single burst of star formation at z=3𝑧3z=3italic_z = 3 followed by passive evolution to z=0𝑧0z=0italic_z = 0. Next, we define normalized magnitudes as\n\nmnorm=m−m∗,subscript𝑚norm𝑚superscript𝑚m_{\\text{norm}}=m-m^{*},italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT norm end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_m - italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , (2)\n\nwhere m𝑚mitalic_m is the magnitude of each galaxy. This allows us to compare the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of galaxy clusters despite differences in redshift as we consider the cluster redshift and K-corrections in the applied models. Note that we inherently define normalized colors that correspond to the subtraction of two normalized magnitudes.\n\nSubsequently, we fit a double Gaussian model to the normalized color distribution (g−r)normsubscript𝑔𝑟norm(g-r)_{\\text{norm}}( italic_g - italic_r ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT norm end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of each galaxy cluster. This is based on the well-known bimodal color distribution in the member galaxies of these systems, featuring both the blue cloud and the red sequence (e.g., Baldry et al., 2004; Balogh et al., 2004; Menci et al., 2005). We define the red_limit as μred−3⁢σredsubscript𝜇red3subscript𝜎red\\mu_{\\text{red}}-3\\sigma_{\\text{red}}italic_μ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT red end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 3 italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT red end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where μredsubscript𝜇red\\mu_{\\text{red}}italic_μ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT red end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and σredsubscript𝜎red\\sigma_{\\text{red}}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT red end_POSTSUBSCRIPT correspond to the mean value and standard deviation of the Gaussian fitted to the red component, respectively. An example of these double Gaussian fittings for a cluster for each dynamical state is shown in Fig. 3.\n\nAfter that, we select the red galaxies from each galaxy cluster as those where (g−r)norm>subscript𝑔𝑟normabsent(g-r)_{\\text{norm}}>( italic_g - italic_r ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT norm end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > red_limit and apply a robust linear regression using the HuberRegressor (Huber & Ronchetti, 2011) to fit the Red Sequence (Fig. 4). This regression model has the advantage of being less influenced by the presence of outliers. To achieve this, the sample is divided into two groups, with inliers having an absolute error smaller than a certain threshold. Those not meeting this condition are considered outliers and given less weight. Specifically, the HuberRegressor optimizes the squared loss for the sub-sample where |(y−Xw−c)/σ|<ϵ𝑦subscript𝑋𝑤𝑐𝜎italic-ϵ|(y-X_{w}-c)/\\sigma|<\\epsilon| ( italic_y - italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_w end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_c ) / italic_σ | < italic_ϵ (inliers) and the absolute loss for the sub-sample where |(y−Xw−c)/σ|>ϵ𝑦subscript𝑋𝑤𝑐𝜎italic-ϵ|(y-X_{w}-c)/\\sigma|>\\epsilon| ( italic_y - italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_w end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_c ) / italic_σ | > italic_ϵ (outliers), where the model coefficient w𝑤witalic_w, intercept c𝑐citalic_c and scale σ𝜎\\sigmaitalic_σ are the parameters to optimize. To achieve a statistical efficiency of 95%, this threshold ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilonitalic_ϵ was set to 1.35. The brightest galaxies within 1⁢σ1𝜎1\\sigma1 italic_σ of the best RS fit of each cluster are selected as BCG candidates.\n\nIt is important to note that the method we ultimately use to discern the BCG of each system is visual inspection, which is particularly useful for measuring the accuracy of the automatic process. However, it is crucial to ensure with spectroscopic information that the galaxy selected as the BCG truly belongs to the cluster. For more details on the accuracy of both methods, refer to Section 7.1.\n\n5 Proxies of dynamical states\n\nIn this subsection, we define the six dynamical state proxies that we utilize. The first two correspond to the offset between the BCG and the X-ray peak and centroid, and were calculated directly by us. The next four were calculated by Yuan & Han (2020) and Yuan et al. (2022), and we extracted the values from their catalogs. The choice to use six parameters together is because each has its limitations, as we describe below, and their combination can provide us with more robust results.\n\n5.1 BCG-X-ray centroid/peak offset\n\nConsidering the highly hydrodynamically collisional nature of the hot gas composing the ICM of galaxy clusters and the typical positioning of the BCG within the deepest region of its gravitational potential well, the BCG can be effectively used as a proxy for the non-collisional dark matter component. Thus, the offset between the position of the X-ray emission peak/centroid and the BCG provides a good approximation of the dynamical state of clusters, at least in the projected sky plane. This is because the components would be noticeably displaced in a merger process between these structures.\n\nFollowing Mann & Ebeling (2012), we use a threshold to distinguish between relaxed and disturbed clusters, with a value of DBCG-X=42⁢(71)subscript𝐷BCG-X4271D_{\\text{BCG-X}}=42(71)italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT BCG-X end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 42 ( 71 ) kpc for the X-ray peak (centroid) offset.\n\n5.2 Morphological parameter δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ\n\nThis parameter is a morphological indicator of the X-ray surface brightness distribution. The definition of Yuan & Han (2020) mentions that the great advantage of this dynamical parameter is its adaptability to the properties of each cluster, allowing a direct comparison between them. The first step in calculating the value of δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ is to fit a 2D elliptical β𝛽\\betaitalic_β model to the X-ray surface brightness distribution. Then, a new parameter of the X-ray distribution profile is calculated:\n\nκ=1+ϵβ,𝜅1italic-ϵ𝛽\\kappa=\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\beta},italic_κ = divide start_ARG 1 + italic_ϵ end_ARG start_ARG italic_β end_ARG , (3)\n\nwhere β𝛽\\betaitalic_β and ϵitalic-ϵ\\epsilonitalic_ϵ are the power-law index and ellipticity of the fitted β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-model, respectively.\n\nBased on the observation that disturbed clusters tend to have a more asymmetric geometry than relaxed clusters (e.g., Okabe et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010), the asymmetry factor α𝛼\\alphaitalic_α is used as an auxiliary variable.\n\nα=∑xi,yi[fobs⁢(xi,yi)−fobs⁢(xi′,yi′)]2∑xi,yifobs2⁢(xi,yi)×100⁢ per cent,𝛼subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖superscriptdelimited-[]subscript𝑓obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑓obssuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖′2subscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑓2obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖100 per cent\\alpha=\\frac{\\sum_{x_{i},y_{i}}[f_{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y_{i})-f_{\\text{obs}}(x_{% i}^{\\prime},y_{i}^{\\prime})]^{2}}{\\sum_{x_{i},y_{i}}f^{2}_{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y% _{i})}\\times 100\\text{ per cent},italic_α = divide start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ] start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_ARG × 100 per cent , (4)\n\nwhere, fobs⁢i⁢s⁢(xi′,yi′)subscript𝑓obs𝑖𝑠superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖′superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑖′f_{\\text{obs}}is(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i}^{\\prime})italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_s ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) the observed flux in the pixel symmetric to fobs⁢(xi,yi)subscript𝑓obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖f_{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y_{i})italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) with respect to the center of the cluster (x0,y0)subscript𝑥0subscript𝑦0(x_{0},y_{0})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), which is obtained from the fitting of the β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-model.\n\nWith a combination of these parameters that quantify the properties of the profiles and the asymmetry of the X-ray surface brightness distribution, the morphological index δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ is defined as:\n\nδ=A⁢κ+B⁢α+C.𝛿𝐴𝜅𝐵𝛼𝐶\\delta=A\\kappa+B\\alpha+C.italic_δ = italic_A italic_κ + italic_B italic_α + italic_C . (5)\n\nTo find appropriate values for the free parameters, Yuan & Han (2020) used a homogeneous calibration sample of 125 clusters qualitatively classified by Mann & Ebeling (2012), finding that the values of A=0.68𝐴0.68A=0.68italic_A = 0.68, B=0.73𝐵0.73B=0.73italic_B = 0.73, and C=0.21𝐶0.21C=0.21italic_C = 0.21 can separate the sample into relaxed systems (δ<0𝛿0\\delta<0italic_δ < 0) and disturbed systems (δ≥0𝛿0\\delta\\geq 0italic_δ ≥ 0) with a success rate of 88%.\n\n5.3 Concentration c𝑐citalic_c\n\nGalaxy clusters in a non-virialized state may exhibit various substructures or extended geometries. However, when these systems are very close to virialization, most of the matter is concentrated in their center, with some even having very luminous cool cores (e.g., Fabian et al., 1994; McDonald et al., 2012, 2013). The concentration index, c𝑐citalic_c, quantifies this characteristic by being calculated as the ratio of the integrated X-ray flux within an inner aperture to that within an outer aperture. The definition of Cassano et al. (2010, 2013) was followed, which used apertures of 100 kpc and 500 kpc:\n\nc=S100⁢ kpcS100⁢ kpc=∑R<100⁢ kpcfobs⁢(xi,yi)∑R<500⁢ kpcfobs⁢(xi,yi),𝑐subscript𝑆100 kpcsubscript𝑆100 kpcsubscript𝑅100 kpcsubscript𝑓obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑅500 kpcsubscript𝑓obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖c=\\frac{S_{100\\text{ kpc}}}{S_{100\\text{ kpc}}}=\\frac{\\sum_{R<100\\text{ kpc}}f% _{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y_{i})}{\\sum_{R<500\\text{ kpc}}f_{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y_{i})},italic_c = divide start_ARG italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 100 kpc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 100 kpc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG = divide start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R < 100 kpc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_ARG start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R < 500 kpc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_ARG , (6)\n\nwhere fobs⁢(xi,yi)subscript𝑓obssubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖f_{\\text{obs}}(x_{i},y_{i})italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) is the observed flux in the pixel (xi,yi)subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖(x_{i},y_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ).\n\nCassano et al. (2010) found that the median distribution of the concentration parameter log⁡(c)=−0.7𝑐0.7\\log(c)=-0.7roman_log ( italic_c ) = - 0.7 is a reasonable threshold to distinguish galaxy clusters in different dynamical states. These states were classified based on their features observed in radio images.\n\n5.4 Centroid shift ω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ω\n\nIn relaxed clusters, there is an almost negligible deviation between the positions of the X-ray peak and the X-ray centroid. However, these two positions can exhibit a considerable shift in clusters undergoing mergers. Poole et al. (2006) quantified the deviation between the X-ray peak and the center of a model fit within 20 apertures of different sizes centered on the X-ray peak. The aim was to obtain a value that helps determine the dynamical state of the cluster. This is an iterative process that starts from 0.05 Rapsubscript𝑅apR_{\\text{ap}}italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ap end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and increases to Rapsubscript𝑅apR_{\\text{ap}}italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ap end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in increments of 0.05⁢Rap0.05subscript𝑅ap0.05R_{\\text{ap}}0.05 italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ap end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

This choice, like the parameters c𝑐citalic_c and ω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ω, is based on the article by Cassano et al. (2010), where the thresholds are defined as the medians of the distributions.\n\n6 Dynamical states of galaxy clusters\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dynamical parameters alone do not robustly separate galaxy cluster samples. This is due to various factors appropriately discussed in the articles in which they were developed (i.e., Buote & Tsai, 1995; Poole et al., 2006; Cassano et al., 2010; Mann & Ebeling, 2012; Yuan & Han, 2020). For example, parameters such as c𝑐citalic_c, ω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ω, and P3/P0subscript𝑃3subscript𝑃0P_{3}/P_{0}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are calculated on fixed apertures. However, clusters have different sizes, so the values derived from these apertures may not be entirely comparable. That is why Yuan & Han (2020) decided to develop a new parameter (δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ), which is adaptable to the size of these systems. Despite this, the parameter alone still has a considerable overlapping region.\n\nIf we add the offsets of the BCG with the X-ray peak and centroid to the parameters as mentioned earlier, which are pretty robust proxies due to their multiwavelength nature and the components they approximate in each structure, then we propose that we can more robustly approximate the dynamical state of galaxy clusters.\n\nA method that might initially seem effective is to create a Boolean sum of disturbance conditions. Then, one could observe the distribution of this Boolean sum and categorize the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters, perhaps with an intermediate region. However, as seen in Fig. 5, several parameters are correlated with each other, either positively or negatively. Therefore, this method could potentially give more statistical weight to one parameter over another, leading to biased results.\n\nTo address this situation, we searched the literature for clusters in our study sample with dynamical states determined using other methods, such as visual inspection of features in radio and a combination of optical and X-ray observations. This subset consists of 26 systems with well-defined dynamical states.\n\nSubsequently, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to this subsample. PCA is a statistical tool that, using a linear transformation, can reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying (linearly) correlated variables and eliminating noise and redundancy in the data. The advantage of this technique is that it can transform a set of possibly related variables into another set of more fundamental independent variables (Hotelling, 1933). Additionally, if the redundancy is significant and, hence, there is a correlation between the variables, it might be possible to reproduce the original values of the variables with fewer principal components than the original number of variables in the dataset without losing their features.\n\nThus, we apply PCA to our set of variables {DBCG-XP\\{D_{\\text{BCG-X}_{\\text{P}}}{ italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT BCG-X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, DBCG-XPsubscript𝐷subscriptBCG-XPD_{\\text{BCG-X}_{\\text{P}}}italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT BCG-X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT,δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ, c𝑐citalic_c, ω𝜔\\omegaitalic_ω, P3/P0}P_{3}/P_{0}\\}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT }. Fig. 6 shows that the first principal component (PC 1) can roughly separate the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters. With this observation, we extracted the statistical weights of each dynamical parameter associated with PC 1 (see Table 2). Subsequently, we perform a weighted Boolean sum to determine the dynamical state of the clusters.\n\nwbs=∑iwi⁢Bi,wbssubscript𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝐵𝑖\\texttt{wbs}=\\sum_{i}w_{i}\\,B_{i},wbs = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , (12)\n\nwhere wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i}italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the statistical weight extracted from PCA and Bisubscript𝐵𝑖B_{i}italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the Boolean value.\n\nAs observed in the distribution of the weighted Boolean sum (wbs) in Fig. 7, it is suggestive to divide the sample into three categories: relaxed clusters (wbs <0absent0<0< 0), intermediate clusters (0≤0absent0\\leq0 ≤ wbs ≤1absent1\\leq 1≤ 1), and disturbed clusters (wbs >1absent1>1> 1). This is the criterion that we use throughout this work.\n\nUsing the wbs criterion to estimate the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, we have identified 32 relaxed clusters, 30 systems in an intermediate dynamical state, and 25 disturbed galaxy clusters.\n\nIn Fig. 8, the scaled values for each proxy are displayed, with the dynamical states of each system represented by the colors blue, green, and red for the relaxed, intermediate, and disturbed clusters, respectively. The values of each parameter were scaled using the StandardScaler class from the scikit-learn python package. We note that, except for the concentration parameter, the relaxed clusters generally have lower values than the disturbed clusters for the dynamical state proxies, leaving the intermediate clusters with values precisely in between the two. Furthermore, in Fig. 9 we see the median values of each dynamical parameter with their respective standard errors for each dynamical state. We observe a significant difference between relaxed and disturbed clusters, placing the intermediate clusters in a transition zone between them, which gives us confidence in the methodology employed (i.e. PCA). It is essential to mention that the sign of the concentration values has been inverted in Fig. 9. This was done to facilitate visualization, as this is the only proxy where higher values indicate relaxation, and this can lead to misinterpretations when observing an overlapping zone between relaxed and disturbed clusters that do not exist.\n\n7 Discussion and conclusions\n\n7.1 BCG selection accuracy\n\nWe mentioned in Section 4 that we employed an automatic method to select the BCGs of all the galaxy clusters in the sample. However, we used visual inspection to ensure that the selection was correct. In 70% of the cases, the BCG selected by both methods coincides. For the remaining cases, we attribute the error of the automatic method to three main reasons; the cluster membership method used, the specific physical processes that can occur, and special cases. Specifically, the first is that the method of assigning members using photometric redshifts has a contamination rate that can reach 25%, and this can cause a redder galaxy than the BCG to be found within the 1⁢σ1𝜎1\\sigma1 italic_σ region of the best fit of the Red Sequence, but that does not actually belong to the cluster. The second reason is due to the presence of cooling flows in relaxed clusters, where the cold gas directly reaches the BCG, triggering significant star formation and/or nuclear activity (e.g., Rawle et al., 2012). This causes the BCG to be bluer and, therefore, might not be selected by the automatic method. Regarding special cases, it is possible for a spectroscopic confirmed member galaxy within R200subscript𝑅200R_{200}italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 200 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to be brighter than the BCG. An example of this is the galaxy cluster Abell 3827, where four galaxies in the central region are likely to merge into a dominant central galaxy (cD) in the future (Carrasco et al., 2010). However, at the time of observation, this has not yet ocurred, and there exists another galaxy that is brighter than any of the four central ones, but it does not meet the other criteria for classification as the BCG (Carrasco et al., 2024, in preparation).\n\nEven more importantly, since we measure the accuracy of the automatic method with respect to visual inspection, we must ensure that the selection of the BCG using the latter method is indeed correct. To this end, we have spectroscopic information from the literature (Table 1). In Fig. 10, we present as an example the peculiar velocities of six galaxy clusters from the sample within the range of ±6000plus-or-minus6000\\pm 6000± 6000 km s-1, and we observe that all the BCGs selected visually indeed belong to the cluster. This occurs for the 30 systems for which we have spectroscopic information for the BCG selected by visual inspection, which gives us confidence in the method.\n\n7.2 Dynamical parameters\n\nAlthough classifying dynamical states based on a single parameter can help to distinguish the most extreme cases, a proper combination of these indices can be more robust. To quantify this, we compared our results with those obtained by Yuan & Han (2020) and Yuan et al. (2022). For disturbed clusters, we find consistent results between our classification system and that used by Yuan & Han (2020) and Yuan et al. (2022) (δ>0𝛿0\\delta>0italic_δ > 0). However, we note a discrepancy for the relaxed clusters. Of the 32 relaxed galaxy clusters in our sample, 13 do not fall into this category according to the Yuan & Han (2020) and Yuan et al. (2022) criteria (δ<0𝛿0\\delta<0italic_δ < 0) . This fraction corresponds to 40%, and since this is a rather high value, we have individually analyzed these 13 systems. They all have a w⁢b⁢s𝑤𝑏𝑠wbsitalic_w italic_b italic_s value of -0.0057, which is almost at the threshold of our separation between relaxed and intermediate clusters. However, upon inspection, only Abell 3322, Abell 3783, and MCXCJ0528.9-3927 exhibit interaction features typical of an unrelaxed cluster (see Figs. 11, 12 and 13). This indicates the need for an intermediate systems category rather than opting for a binary classification between relaxed and disturbed clusters, and our combined use of dynamical state proxies allows us to do this robustly.\n\nThe binary separation between relaxed and disturbed clusters arises from the bimodalities found in the distributions of these dynamical parameters. Still, in some cases, the bimodalities may be absent, making the classification task more challenging (e.g., Campitiello et al., 2022). It has been shown that using two dynamical state proxies together in a two-dimensional parameter space can aid in this classification task (e.g., Cassano et al., 2010, 2013). However, even more robust results can be obtained by combining multiple dynamical parameters, such as with the M𝑀Mitalic_M statistic (e.g., Rasia et al., 2013; Lovisari et al., 2017). In our case, we have chosen to use PCA with our set of six proxies, finding that the first principal component can effectively separate the dynamical states of the clusters, which is consistent with Campitiello et al. (2022).\n\n7.3 Classification of dynamical states\n\nFrom our total sample of 87 galaxy clusters, we classified 32 (∼36%similar-toabsentpercent36\\sim 36\\%∼ 36 %) as relaxed clusters, 30 (∼34%similar-toabsentpercent34\\sim 34\\%∼ 34 %) as systems with an intermediate dynamical state, and 25 (∼29%similar-toabsentpercent29\\sim 29\\%∼ 29 %) as disturbed clusters of galaxies. Thus, we identified a fraction of ∼63%similar-toabsentpercent63\\sim 63\\%∼ 63 % of galaxy clusters in an unrelaxed state (intermediate and disturbed), which is consistent with the expected range of 30−80%30percent8030-80\\%30 - 80 % according to previous studies (e.g., Dressler & Shectman, 1988; Santos et al., 2008; Fakhouri et al., 2010; Wen & Han, 2013; Yuan & Han, 2020; Yuan et al., 2022). This sample will then be our starting point in Paper II to study the effect of the dynamical state of galaxy clusters on their populations, focusing on the physical and structural properties of member galaxies.\n\nAcknowledgements.\n\nJLNC & SVA acknowledges the financial support of DIDULS/ULS, through the Proyecto Apoyo de Tesis de Postgrado N° PTE2353858.
