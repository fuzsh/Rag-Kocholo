The 2021 MSU team advanced to the NCAA \"Sweet Sixteen\" with an overall record of 18-3-2. While at MSU-Mankato, Garcia III had a hand in coaching numerous All-Conference players and four All-Americans.\n\nGarcia III spent time at fellow MIAC institution Hamline before joining the Mavericks, helping the Pipers to their first ever postseason tournament appearance in 2016.\n\nGarcia III has spent over three decades coaching all levels of soccer, winning state, district, regional, and USA Cup championships at the youth, high school and collegiate levels.\n\nA native Texan, Raul was an active athlete at John F.
