        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAmong the different classes of sailing sports, the Laser Radial, Laser 4.7 and 420 classes are in the Monohull category and the Techno 2.93 and RS:X classes are in the Windsurfing category. Laser Radial and RS:X are Olympic sailing classes since 1996 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIn dinghy sailing, the navigation format has changed by the development of the physical and physiological requirements of the sailor, such as muscular strength, muscular endurance and cardiorespiratory performance.1 Different studies have analysed the sailor's physical fitness,2 biomechanics factor3 and physiological demands,4 according to performance level. Anthropometry is used as a reference in sports performance.5 Moreover, the anthropometric and somatotype profiles are related to performance in dinghy sailing.6,7 Some studies have shown the relationship between performance and anthropometric variables, such as having greater body mass, height, thigh length and body mass index (BMI).8,9 The results of these studies show that the most successful sailors have these anthropometric characteristics and they can facilitate a specific technical gesture called hiking bench.9 The main aim of this technical gesture is to overcome the forces that are generated by the effect of the wind, where the body is used as a lever arm.10 Thus, the greater the body mass, height, thigh length and BMI, the more lever arm can be developed by the sailor. In fact, the anthropometric assessment would be important for choosing between one or another sailing class, since optimal anthropometric requirements differ among boat/board classes.11\n\nOver the years, the anthropometric characteristics of athletes have changed, and this has led to numerous changes in the sporting context. Thus, reference bases should be updated every so often. In different sports disciplines, studies have shown the relationship between sports performance and anthropometric characteristics.12, 13, 14 However, most studies are not focused on analysing this relationship, although, in the case of sailing, most of studies provide relevant information on the anthropometric characteristics of sailors.4,7, 8, 9,15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the anthropometric characteristics of elite sailors in the Monohull and Windsurfing categories and their differences based on performance level.\n\n3. Results\n\nNo differences were observed in the age of the participants in terms of category (F = 0.008; p = 0.928; ηp2 = 0.159), performance (F = 3.170; p = 0.086; ηp2 = 0.105) or category·performance (F = 1.922; p = 0.177; ηp2 = 0.066); however, in Windsurfing, the P1 sailors were older than the P2 sailors (p = 0.034) (see ). Regarding weight, statistical differences were detected in performance (F = 14.667; p = 0.001; ηp2 = 0.352), but not in category (F = 1.225; p = 0.278; ηp2 = 0.043) or category·performance (F = 0.201; p = 0.657; ηp2 = 0.007). Therefore, the P1 sailors were heavier than the P2 sailors in both Monohull (p = 0.024) and Windsurfing (p = 0.005). With respect to height, differences were also identified in performance (F = 18.593; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.408), but not in category (F = 3.119; p = 0.089; ηp2 = 0.104) or performance·category (F = 1.645; p = 0.211; ηp2 = 0.057). Therefore, the P1 sailors were taller than the P2 sailors in both Monohull (p = 0.041) and Windsurfing (p = 0.001), and the P1 Monohull sailors were taller than the P1 Windsurfing sailors (p = 0.026). Regarding BMI, no differences were found in category (F = 0.380; p = 0.543; ηp2 = 0.014) or performance·category (F = 0.015; p = 0.904; ηp2 = 0.001), although differences were observed in performance, with a lower value in P1 sailors compared to P2 sailors (F = 7.192; p = 0.012; ηp2 = 0.210).\n\nTable 1\n\nVariableCategoryPerformance50th percentile (P1)100th percentile (P2)TotalAge (years)Monohull18.00 ± 0.6718.17 ± 1.4718.06 ± 1.00Windsurfing17.37 ± 1.51 ∗18.71 ± 0.95 ∗18.00 ± 1.41Total17.72 ± 1.1318.46 ± 1.2018.03 ± 1.20Height (cm)Monohull172.59 ± 5.67 ∗,λ179.30 ± 7.41 ∗175.10 ± 6.99Windsurfing165.84 ± 6.06 ∗,λ178.23 ± 5.33 ∗171.62 ± 8.45Total169.59 ± 6.64 ∗178.72 ± 6.12 ∗173.42 ± 7.80Weight (kg)Monohull62.07 ± 8.88 ∗75.48 ± 10.92 ∗67.10 ± 11.49Windsurfing55.90 ± 7.22 ∗72.87 ± 15.86 ∗63.82 ± 14.51Total59.33 ± 14.51 ∗74.08 ± 13.32 ∗65.51 ± 12.93Body mass index (kg/m2)Monohull20.74 ± 2.0523.52 ± 3.3321.78 ± 2.85Windsurfing20.25 ± 1.5622.79 ± 3.8321.43 ± 3.04Total20.52 ± 1.81 ∗23.12 ± 3.48 ∗21.61 ± 2.90\n\nIn the analysis of body fat, differences were observed in performance (P1 = 15.61 ± 2.77% vs. P2 = 20.42 ± 5.29%; F = 11.255; p = 0.002; ηp2 = 0.294), but not in category (F = 1.343; p = 0.257; ηp2 = 0.047) or performance·category (F = 0.005; p = 0.944; ηp2 <0.001). Therefore, P2 sailors had greater body fat mass than P1 sailors in Monohull (P1 = 16.42 ± 2.02% vs. P2 = 21.28 ± 4.32%; p = 0.028) and in Windsurfing (P1 = 14.60 ± 3.36% vs. P2 = 19.67 ± 5.40%; p = 0.023) (see ).\n\nDistribution of body fat mass on the trunk, arm and leg segments are presented in .

Discussion\n\nThe aim of the present study was to analyse possible differences in anthropometric characteristics of elite sailors between categories (Monohull and Windsurfing) and based on performance level. Regarding performance, it was observed that P2 sailors were taller and heavier than P1 sailors. Similarly, P1 sailors presented a lower BMI, total body fat mass and body fat mass in the trunk, arms, and legs than P2 sailors. In addition, P1 sailors showed a higher total body muscle mass, and body muscle mass in the trunk, arms and legs compared to P2 sailors. Regarding the categories, no differences were detected in height, weight, BMI, total body fat mass or total body muscle mass; however, greater arm fat mass was observed in Monohull sailors compared to Windsurfing sailors. Nevertheless, only in Windsurfing, differences were detected between P1 sailors and P2 sailors. Furthermore, greater arm muscle mass was identified in Windsurfing, although this difference was only detected between P1 sailors in Monohull vs Windsurfing. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the variables body weight, height, BMI, percentages of total fat mass, trunk fat mass, arm fat mass, leg fat mass, total muscle mass, trunk muscle mass, arm muscle mass and leg muscle mass in a real competition situation as a function of the performance of the sailors.\n\nIn the present study, to compare the performance level groups, it was observed that the sailors of the high-performance group had lower body weight in Monohull and Windsurfing categories. This result was observed when the comparisons were made in the total sample. Some studies have described the relationship between performance and body weight in Monohull sailors (Laser class), where these two variables presented a strong negative correlation.6,9 Low body weight may reduce the hydrodynamic drag on the boat or board in the planning condition, allowing the sailor to achieve high speed in the most optimal conditions; this is due to the fact that a smaller area of the hull is in contact with the water, and thus the hull displaces less water from its path.2\n\nRegarding the BMI, when comparing the total sample of sailors, it was observed that the high-level group showed low values of BMI. However, when comparing the sailors of the Monohull and Windsurfing groups separately and between the two categories, no differences were observed. Our results suggest that this variable is key to the performance of these groups of sailors. A study with sailors of the Laser and 470 class showed that those sailors with a greater BMI, within normal weight parameters, could facilitate the stability of the boat only in strong wind conditions.21 However, sailing is a complex sport in which weather conditions are unstable and performance could be determined by the ability to understand and anticipate the weather conditions.22 Thus, having a higher BMI could negatively affect performance when the winds are medium or light. This can be explained by the fact that the sailor would have a greater resistance, which could delay the advance or speed of the boat.\n\nThe results of the present study show that the most successful group of sailors of the total sample, the Monohull category, and the Windsurfing category, had lower percentages of total fat mass, trunk fat mass, arm fat mass, and leg fat mass compared to the less successful sailors. As in other sports, the excessive fat mass could be considered a disadvantage, as it decreases the efficiency of movement and, therefore, performance can be adversely affected.23 In sailing, the mobility and range of motion of sailors could be affected by a worse ratio of lean-vs-fat body mass, worsening the capability of changing position during tacking.24\n\nAs was expected, regarding the percentage of total muscle mass in the total sample, Monohull category and Windsurfing category, it was observed that elite sailors have a greater percentage compared to the less successful sailors. Performance in the Windsurfing and Monohull categories is directly associated with the capacity of the sailor to overcome the external forces imposed by the board/boat and rig.2,25 Since sailors need muscular strength to develop technical and tactical skills, this will determine the sailing performance.26,27\n\nFurthermore, the results show that the elite Windsurfing sailors have greater percentage of arm muscle mass and leg muscle mass compared to low-level sailors. Muscular strength in upper and lower limbs is commonly considered an important characteristic for improved performance in boardsailing.28 In the Windsurfing class, the main muscles are: trapezius, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, gluteus maximus and tibialis anterior.29 Therefore, and based on the obtained results, we can assume that this aspect is key in the difference of level performance of Windsurfing sailors.\n\nRegarding the differences between categories, it was observed that the sailors of the Monohull category had a greater percentage of arm fat mass compared to the Windsurfing category. Similarly, comparing the muscle mass between the categories, it was observed that higher-level Windsurfing sailors presented a higher arm muscle mass. Our results suggest that, in this study, the anthropometric characteristic of the upper limbs could be the variable that would determine sailor performance. Furthermore, it could determine the anthropometric differences between these two classes of sailors. Concerning the upper limbs in elite Windsurfing sailors, studies have shown that these athletes have high activation in the shoulder and arm muscles.29 Moreover, upper body strength and endurance are very important for boardsailors to maintain control of the board and achieve good performance in regattas.28 Therefore, it could be considered that the most suitable type of boat according to the characteristics of the sailor is determined by the anthropometric profile.30 Thus, optimal anthropometric requirements differ among these boat classes. These findings could be useful to prepare specific training programmes accordingly.\n\nIn our study, we can consider some limitations. Firstly, the sample of the present study can be a limitation. Having a more representative sample would have allowed us to draw more precise conclusions, and a more balanced sampled in terms of age and sex would have allowed comparing boys and girls in each of the categroy group. Therefore, this limitation could condition the interpretation of the results of our study. Thus, the number of participants analysed consisted of only 42 sailors. However, this represents 37% of the total sailors who participated in this regatta. On the other hand, analysing the relationship between the speed of the boat and the anthropometric characteristics of the sailor could be a future line of research. In addition, the use of bioelectrical impedance is a limitation of the study. A multi-frequency stand-on hand to foot 8-electrode bioimpedance was used for the estimation of body composition parameters. These devices have previously been validated against dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), showing high correlations between devices for fat free mass, fat mass, and percentage of body fat estimation. Furthermore, the mean difference between the equations derived from bioimpedance and DXA are small and not significant, suggesting the validity of bioimpedance as an alternative for the estimation of body composition parameters when DXA is not available.31 Finally, no information was gathered about the metabolic responses during the regatta. Combined with the analysis of the physiological characteristics, it would give information about physiological demands during regatta. These results can be of great interest to coaches of sailors, since they can help them in the development and prescription of training programmes by coaches in preparing individual players for competition; unfortunately, it was not possible to include such data in our study. Moreover, future studies could be focused on the analysis of the physiological characteristics combined with metabolic responses during the regatta."
