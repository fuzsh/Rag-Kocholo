I will watch this page. --Ancheta Wis (talk | contribs)\n\nsome documentation can be found in Wikipedia:HotCat , a JavaScript add-on which can be selected in your Preferences profile. Anywhere else? --Ancheta Wis (talk | contribs)\n\nTo familiarize myself with the powerful utility HotCat I noticed that Portal:Urdu was too high up in the hierarchy. The minus symbol removed this link and popped me into the editor, at which point I believed I understood the semantics. Might there be anything else I'm missing? __Ancheta Wis (talk | contribs)\n\nI consider categorization as simple busy work for editors who don't have the capacity or desire to actually write articles. I suppose it keeps them off the streets, but does anybody actually use the categories to find WP articles? Are there statistics? This has been troubling me for a long time. GeorgeLouis (talk)\n\nIn a word, yes. Before there were portals, there were categories, which even served as portals for some years. As for statistics, there was an article in Signpost with some graphs, some years back. Sorry, you'll have to search there if you want more.\n\nBut you know what, we can always use critical editors on the lookout for NPOV categories. Your thoughts are welcome. --Ancheta Wis (talk | contribs)\n\nI use categories to find articles all the time. They're particularly helpful when the spelling of an article title is variable (or just difficult), or if the title may contain diacritics, parentheticals for disambiguation, or anything else that might make it difficult to locate an article by title alone. postdlf (talk)\n\nThanks for your comments. GeorgeLouis (talk)\n\nThe question is what categories should a naturalized American citizen born in Mexico to parents born in Argentina who in turn were immigrants from German and Italy be in. It is fairly clear that they belong in Category:Mexican people of Argentine descent, Category:Mexican people of German descent, Category:Mexican people of Italian descent and Category:Mexican emigrants to the United States. Persoanlly I think that this is a sufficient number of ancestry and natioanlity categories for anyone. However some people seem to think we should also put this indicidual in Category:American people of Argentine descent, Category:American people of Italian descent and Category:American people of German descent. I think that is just excessive. I think we should limit x people of y descent to those who are x people by birth. We have the immigrant categories which fill their function, but to get into anything else just leads to an excessively high number of categories, especially because we can actually find people who immigrated more than once in their lives.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI have long had issues with the descent categories without a benchmark for how much is enough. So for your example, the person is Mexican by place of birth and of German and Italian descent. Now, is 50% defining for heritage? But your example point out how difficult placing people into these categories really is. I would love to see some clear objective guidelines. Right now consensus seems to support self identification. But is someone who is 12.5% of one heritage notable for being of that descent? Or 6.25% if they self identify? Even Native American tribes don't agree on how much blood you need to be in a specific tribe. It varies by tribe and who is in power as I understand it. There is a related expat issue. Just yesterday I read an article for a played who was listed in about 8 expat articles. Are any of those defining? Note that I realize that heritage can affect disease susceptibility. But is that defining for an encyclopedia? I have been thinking about starting an RFC on this topic. So... Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nInteresting, your response did not even try to answer my question. I think the record number of descent categories I have seen someone placed in is 8. I am not as concerned about proportion as time. I have seen articles on people born in the 20th century that note the person had an ancestory who came on the Mayflower in the early 17th century and then categorize them as of English descent. I would not go as far as the early-20th century \"German stock\" rules of the census that limited ther term to people who had at least one parent born in Germany. However when people who said things like \"the only thing Irish about me is my name\" get classed as being of Irish descent people have gone too far.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nDo comments need to answer questions that are posed? Proportion and time both have merits. If all of someone's grand parents were born in Foo, they should be able to self identify as Fooian is they desire. But is that defining? And no, I'm not sure. But that case is easier then for someone who is 25% Fooian. Your point on time is also valid, but for how many generations? And when you choose an number of generations, how is that not arbitrary unless the limit is for one generation which is arbitrary, but may be supportable. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nThe question is, should people of descents be so categorized in each of their nationality categories, or should we assume by their birth nationality is enough. A simplet case, which avoids the potential nightmare of the case I gave, but maybe will gauge opinion more clearly is, we have a person born in the United Kingdom to parents who immigrated from Pakistan. Then they immigrate to the United States. They clearly belong in Category:British people of Pakistani descent and Category:British emigrants to the United States. Do they also belong in Category:American people of Pakistani descent. Of course, if I did want to make this complex, I would change it to someone who was born in Britain, to parents born in Kenya and Uganda, who were in turn children of people from India, except at least one of the person's grandparents had been born in what is now Pakistan, but the family was Hindu, and they left long before Pakistan was created. OK, now I am just trying to give you a headache. However since Pakistan is a country ctreated in the 20th century with no clear group previously counting as \"Pakistani\", Pakistani is almost as potentially complicating an ancestry as Israeli.\n\nComment a possibly more complicating factor. Lets say a person is ethnically Tamil and born in the United Kingdom, such that they fit in Category:British people of Tamil descent (which I am not even sure it exists). Then they emigrate to the United States qualifying as Category:British emigrants to the United States. Do they also go in Category:American people of Tamil descent (which I know exists)?John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nRelated to my last example is Sunkrish Bala, an ethnic Tamil from India now a US citizen. What remains unclear to me is if he is Tamil or just \"of Tamil descent\". Currently he is in Category:Indian emigrants to the United States and Category:American people of Tamil descent. Should he also be in Category:Tamil people or is foo people of bar descent a subcat of that, and so he can't be in that as a parent cat?John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI have a workable theory on this but I am not sure I can quite explain it, and I am less sure that people will support it. Basically it is people who are clearly part of an ethnic group, and not just possesors of a given descent, in their home country can be classified as of that descent in their country of emigration. That is people of mixed German and Italian descent living in Argentina or Mexico are not clealry part of an ethnic group. Ethnic Poles living in the German empire or Ethnic Germans living in Russia (who we class in Category:Russian-German people) are clearly part of an ethnic group. The former on emigration to the US should just be put in the emigrant category, while the later cases can be put in ancestry categories related to their origin ancestries. On the other hand, maybe that is too complicated and so we should adopt as a rule people can be classed in all defined ancestries for each country they are citizen-residents of. I want to at least add that caveat, because I don't want to see an American person of German, Filipino, African-American and Portuguese descent classified as German of any of those descents just because they have dual-citizenship when they have never been a permanent resident of Germany.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nJust to give you a flavor of how complexed these categorization schemes get we have Joshua Beloya. When I came across his article he was in Category:American people of Filipino descent probably because originally he was in Category:Filipino-American people before the mass rename in the spring of 2010. The old name was ambiguous, the new name is by most accounts not a good descriptor. Beloya was born in the Philippines to an American father and a Filipino mother. If that was all he would be fairly simple to categorize. However after his father died, his mother remarried a Swiss national, and then they emigrated to Switzerland. So he is also in Category:Filipino emigrants to Switzerland. The question I have is, should he also be in Category:Swiss people of American descent?John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI think we are getting into political waters here by denying categorizations for how people might self identify. We should consider this sensitivity on the basis of WP:BLP. For instance, the Pakistani mentioned by John Pack Lambert may be most directly of British emigration, but if they came here young and moved to a Pakistani neighborhood like Devon in Chicago, there is probably a lot of self-identity wrapped up in being a Pakistani-American and having Pakistani parents, which would fit under the Category:American people of Pakistani descent. I would think WP:BLP should come into play in that omissions can also be \"Contentious material\". I am an inclusionist so I don't see a solid argument here for \"too many\" categories, though I do agree with Johnpacklambert that WP:Verifiability calls for reference of ancestry in the article. Wikipedia:Categorization of people#General considerations Limit the number does call for minimizing the number of cats if possible, but it also states that the whole point is to \"ensure that categories contain all of the most relevant articles\". Equally, generational limitations on that ancestry don't seem necessary. The Mayflower/British American example given above actually sounds reasonable to me. I suspect this may be a regional thing as well. People from different regions of the US hold differing views on self identification based on where their ancestors come from. Again I would default to WP:BLP and say that if the article self references where ancestors are from, why not add the cat? --Dkriegls (talk to me!)\n\nI would point out the Mayflower example is \"of English descent\" not \"of British descent\". Also it is \"Americans of English descent\" not \"English Americans\". The later term is just too imprecise. Where it is clear I at times try to move away from \"English-Americans\" to the more precise \"American of English descent\" or \"English-born American\" in the text, or on occasion \"American born English\" or \"English of American descent\". However there are many articles, that say \"Joan Garcia was a Filipino-American actress\" and it is never clear whether they mean she was born in the Philippines, or her parents were or what, so I just leave it with that ambiguous term.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI was going to summarize a consensus, but I am not sure we have one. It seems that the one person besides me who has weighed in thinks that someone born in England to Pakistani parents who then moved to the US should be in 1- Category:English people of Pakistani descent, 2-Category:English emigrants to the United States and 3-[[:Category:American people of Pakistani descent. I can live with that.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI am still waiting for any answer that addresses my original question. That was the person born in Mexico to parents who immigrated to Mexico from Argentina and whose ancestors had come to Argetina from Germany and Italy. This person then immigrated to the United States. What seems clear to me is they belong in 1-Category:Mexcian people of Argentine descent, 2-Category:Mexican people of German descent, 3-Category:Mexican people of Italian descent and 4-Category:Mexican emigrants to the United States. Do we also need to repeat the first three cats for being American. Or do we assume German and Italian are ethnic origins, but Argentine is a passing nationality descriptor and not repeat it, but repeat the German and Italian identifiers?John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI actually have found that the in article rule works wonders. There were a whole bunch of people in Category:American people of German descent who were put their because it mentioned in the article who their grandfather, or greatgrandfather was. Others were put there because you could go back through multiple articles and identify the great grandfather. Then in the article on the great-grandfather it mentioned that his paternal line ancestors had a few hundred years before moved to what would become the United States from Germany. In my mind this does not work. If we want to categorize someone we need to mention that their ancestors came from a given place in the article on them, not hide it four articles away. If the ancestry is significant to them it will be mentioned in the article on them. Applying this rule gets rid of a lot of unjustified categorizations. This is especially true because the system I described could in theory put someone who had 7 great-grand parents emigrate to the US from Italy into Category:American people of German descent and not Category:American people of Italian descent. That is an even bigger possibility with the categorization just by assuming a last name means a certain ancestry. That is even more problematic because last names mean no such thing.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nOn the Mayflower issue, one of my ancestors who came over just after the Mayflower married a women who was part of the Wampanoag people, making me part Wampanoag. If I remember correctly this makes me about one-2000th Wampanoag. Most people laugh at me when I bring this up and consider my claims to Native American ancestry unreasonable. Of course I later learned that some of my ancestors in the late-18th century on another line may have still been fully Cherokee. Considering my grandmother can trace all her lines back to England, and most of her grandparents were born in England, I just do not think that a claim to English ancestry that precdes the formation of the United States by over a century-and-a-half is notable for people born over 2 centuries after the US was formed. This does not mean I am going to change categorization for any article that actually states the person's ancestors came from England, but it has to be said in the article not just assumed from an assumption based on last names or what not.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\n--To your point about not using both categories for Mexican people of German decent and American people of German Decent, I would defer to the usage of the category as a navigation template. If I am looking for interesting biographies about either one, I would need that biography to appear in both categories. Back tracking through the Mexican emigrants to the United States category wouldn't work becasue I wouldn't even be aware of the initial ancestry. Your point about subcategories populating into parent categories avoids this problem and allows for simplified categorization as you have been doing. It is however not the case above. I think we need to prioritize the utility of the individual category as a navigation tool over the tidiness of the categories at the bottom of a bio page. --Dkriegls (talk to me!)\n\n--To your point about citations being used from another family member's page; I have dealt with this a lot working with Notable People lists. I don't feel like looking up the rule but citations must be on the page of the actual referenced materiel. No exception. Most list pages are completely void of citations even though they shouldn't be. However, that doesn't mean deleting the information. If there is reasonable enough evidence that a citation can be found, then deletion just gets viewed as uncivil behavior. Copying that citation from the ancestor's bio would be the appropriate action --Dkriegls (talk to me!)\n\n--To your point about last names being used to justify categorization; there is no justification for that under Wikipedia:Verifiability.\n\n--Finally, the Mayflower or 0.005% Native American issue. I think it is boarding on WP:OR to restrict such categorization if it is cited and especially if the subject self identified as such. For instance Obama. I think if I was looking over the category for Americans or English Ancestry, I would very interested to learn about our president being in that category, Even if it was several generations back when they emigrated, his mother self identified as such and he writes about that identity in his memoir. I am an inclusionist, but agree with you that citation is key. --Dkriegls (talk to me!)\n\nI would note 1/2000 would suggest 11 generations back (with 1 generation back meaning 1 of your parents was 'fully' whatever, 2 generations back meaning 1 of your grandparents was 'fully' whatever, this may not be the standard meaning) and it would seem fairly rare people can actually trace their ancestry that far back. But I agree if they can and self identified as such and this is noted in RS, there doesn't seem to be a good reason to restrict such categorisation. (In reality, figures like 1/2048 almost definitely mean a rough minimum of 1/2048 presuming the understanding of the person's ancestry is roughly correct. To truly know you are only 1/2048 you'd need to actually know the information on all '2048' of these ancestors otherwise you can't rule out some of the other '2048' being whatever you're referring to. I say '2048' because it's resonably possible there are less then 2048 as some are the same person.) Nil Einne (talk)\n\nI'd like some guidance on Wikipedia policy with regard to categorization of biography articles as far as the subject of the article's having been awarded honorary memberships, or otherwise recognized for achievements. How does WP:DEFINING apply in these cases? Many editors seem to be completely ignoring that rule of categorization in applying categories to articles.\n\nAn example is the Ban Ki-Moon article, which includes Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Rio Branco and the Category:Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun (Peru) as well as the Category:Order of Friendship (Kazakhstan). Are any of these orders defining for Ban Ki-moon? Would his belonging to these orders be noteworthy enough that they should be mentioned in the lead for his article? Should not, under the guidelines, membership in these orders be included in WP in list form rather than by categorization?\n\nIf the consensus is to keep these forms of categories on the bio pages, then shouldn't the Categorization guideline page (and related guidelines pages) be modified to indicate that a different guideline is operative for honorary orders and similar non-defining categories? Dezastru (talk)\n\nI think all we have in the way of guidelines is WP:OC#AWARD, which just says that it's only the exceptional award that merits a category, and all others should be dealt with only by lists. And the question is whether the category should exist or not, not whether it should or shouldn't be applied to some individuals for whom it may be factually applicable but relatively unimportant. For the three you gave examples of above, taking a quick look at them, I'd be surprised if any survived at CFD, though note also that we're dealing with guidelines and not \"rules\", which is why anyone can create these kinds of categories and it's possible that there might be a consensus at CFD to keep them. postdlf (talk)\n\nIn going through the building categories, I have seen several default sorts being used which are probably incorrect and I just want to do a sanity check here.\n\nSome NRHP articles use a default sort like a person article when the building article title includes a persons name. This causes random sorting in larger general categories since this is not always done and virtually all of the articles outside of that project just use the building name. I have been removing this when found since the resulting sort is consistent and, as I recall, have not had any objections.\n\nMany building articles use an address. So they have been sorting by a number (using the article title). I just ran into one article that used a default sort for 'street, number'. So which is the preferred solution? Doing the sorting by the street number or street name? Also we have articles titled as Building at number street and these probably should not be sorted as building. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nMany British building articles set a default sort of city, I think this may mostly be for religious buildings but I'm not sure. This makes no sense for the general categories that cover all countries. So I have been changing the default sort to what would normally be used and using the by city sort on the categories I think it was intended for. Also the sort being used generally does not follow the general sorting rules since it just uses the title leaving in punctuation and not expanding abbreviations. So should these articles be changed to just use the normal default sort by name for all categories?\n\nAdvice appreciated. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nOne additional observation on 2, If you look at Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1991, you can see how using the article title for sorting produces a sort that is not correct. So it may be that for articles that start with a number sometime of default sort will be required. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nA building named after a person has a specific name. This is especially true in cases where the building is named after a person's nickname or common name, and not their birth name. It obviously shouldn't be sorted as a person's name would be in a phone book : )\n\nI don't understand this, could you link an example?\n\n(As I'm certain you're aware of already : ) - The goal of sorting is to enhance navigation. Imagine looking in the cat, but not seeing something that starts with C til you get to M. That's needlessly confusing, especially in large cats. I presume we want like things sorted together, and so on.\n\nIf you give some specific examples, I'd be glad to look them over. - jc37\n\n2 check in Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1991 and Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1875. I don't recall the one with the default sort set to street, number, but I believe it was in the UK. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nYou know, maybe I spoke too hastily.\n\nLook at the sortkey here: John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.\n\nIt dawned on me that we may have a COMMONNAME issue here as well. Do we use the full name, or the commonname? Marshall Field and Company Building is not known as the Field building. But Field Museum of Natural History, does specifically use the last name and not the first name (Both are named after the same person.)\n\nSo I guess I'm not sure. We may need to check some references and see what sources call the buildings in questions (I have little doubt that sources will vary on sort rules, however, as we've seen in the past.) - jc37\n\nBut as you said, that may be more of a common name issue. If the article is correctly named, then there should be no need for using DEFAULTSORT. In your example, on the MacArthur Foundation, the sort key should probably be 'MacArthur Foundation'. In my opinion, the current guidelines prohibit the default sorts used by the NRHP editors to sort buildings by person names like these were people articles, the British building sorting by city and the occasional river sorting by numeric level of the branch. If I were to add something to the project page it would be along the lines that if you are implementing a local project recommendation, you should not use DEFAULTSORT, but should use the piped sort on only those categories that must follow the project guideline. Sorting should be for the general reader and not the expert. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nI have never used categories, and have never even understood why anyone cared about them. Until now. I am trying to gather information on professional sports franchises that have relocated (e.g., Brooklyn Dodgers ---> Los Angeles Dodgers, or Decatur Staleys ---> Chicago Bears), and so I automatically went to the bottom of the page for New Orleans Hornets (né Charlotte Hornets), assuming that there would be a category Relocated Professional Sports Franchises, but there was nothing like that. There was a category on Teams established in 1988, and some obvious stuff about the NBA, but not what (to me) seemed to be an obvious and fascinating category--the relocated teams.\n\nSo my question is, how does one create such a category? Can I, on my own, create it and apply it where it is appropriate to use? Or do I have to take my idea through some vetting process? If so, at what venue? Here?\n\nThanks for any help. HuskyHuskie (talk)\n\nThe starting place is to read Wikipedia:Categorization. In the case you are asking about, the question would be, is this a defining aspect for a team? I'm not sure that the answer would be yes. It is an interesting fact and likely encyclopedic. However this material would be better presented as a list article where it would provide the year, both cities and both leagues/divisions. All of that really can not be done with categories. Note the existence of the relocation of professional sports teams article. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nThanks for your quick and thorough reply. I'm puzzled by something you said that perhaps the article will answer. You asked, is this a defining aspect for a team?. I certainly think not, but that's not what I'm looking for. I've presumed that categories would help find articles that have something in common, which certainly the Memphis Grizzlies and Chicago Bears do (other than their ursine mascots). Anyway, I'll read Wikipedia:Categorization and look at the relocation article, and try to find my answers there. Thanks again. HuskyHuskie (talk)\n\nAt least for American professional baseball, this should be a redirect category at least in part. Many/most/all of the pages that should be its members are redirects from the old names of ballclubs to their new names. For example see Brooklyn Dodgers --the redirect not its target-- and skim Category:Redirect-Class Baseball articles --which is a talk category comprising Talk: Brooklyn Dodgers and so on.\n\nMy familiarity with Baseball pages that cover defunct ballclubs and those which have relocated is several years out of date. Only just now I learned that the target of Brooklyn Dodgers is History of the Brooklyn Dodgers. I don't know how many analogous \"History\" articles we have, how many names of defunct ballclubs are now disambiguation pages, etc.\n\nJust now I have added {{R from historic name}} to that Brooklyn Dodgers redirect, which puts it in the appropriate administrative category. If you do add redirects to a new sports category as discussed here (a hard category, so to speak), please add this template at the same time. --P64 (talk)\n\nI have advocated that we keep renamed team articles in the old categories when the article is solely about the old name or team or a by year article. But this position has not gained much support. I think if properly done, having categories for the old and new would be clearer and much more accurate. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\n– Just a pointer to an allegedly relevant discussion elsewhere.\n\nan RFC regarding categorization of disambiguation pages is ongoing at Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation#RFC. Feel free to join in and comment. Carlossuarez46 (talk)\n\nAre categories always categorizing the subject of the article? Or always categorizing the article itself? Or are both acceptable uses of categorization? For example, say we have an article about a shooting, where the shooter has claimed self-defense, and the is a lot of coverage, discussion, etc in reliable sources about if the shooting was self defense. Ultimately the trial hinged on if it was self-defense or not, and in the end was ruled that the killing was not in self defense, and the shooter is convicted of murder. Would self-defense be an appropriate category for that article as the article has quite a bit of content about self-defense in it, but the incident itself was not self-defense? Gaijin42 (talk)\n\nMy personal opinion is that categories are only about the subject, not the article. So in this case I think self-defense would be an incorrect category. Same goes with categorizing abortion in Category:Murder, and so on. -- YPNYPN ✡\n\nWe have categories of both kinds. For example of the other, see Category:Date of birth missing or Search for Category: Articles ..., Category: Redirects ..., and so on. Perhaps all of that other kind are administrative categories?\n\nWe have articles with multiple subjects in the relevant sense, such as an article titled for a book that also covers the book series inaugurated by that book. Probably that article is in some book categories and also in at least one book series category, as long as there is no main article on the series.\n\nRegarding the self-defense issue in a trial for murder, I suppose we have one or more \"main\" articles that are appropriate. Probably we have at least one relevant wikiproject. If the shooting article includes information about self-defense in a trial for murder that is not available elsewhere --or it provides an illustration of extraordinary quality-- the most best action may be to notify editors of the appropriate article or members of the appropriate wikiproject in Talk or Wikipedia Talk space. --P64 (talk)\n\nGenerally the categories an article is in should apply to the article. We generally do not want to clutter broad topics, like self defense, with specific articles. A more tircky issue is should say an article on the murder of person x, where they person is not notable enough to have their own article, go in the applicable deaths in year x category. Let us say the person was named Lydia Smilegood. You could create Lydia Smilegood as a redirect to the article Muder of Lydia Smilegood, and then categorize the redirect there. In general this is the best way to do things, but for various reasons many articles, especially on performing duos, have been put in categories that only apply to one of the people in the duo. Thus we have some articles currently in multiple x year births, which in the case of performing duos is especially odd, because the duos are not born, they are created by the two people involved deciding to collaborate, and as such should really be in the approapriate Performing groups established in x years cats. The other place where this issue comes up is that articles are not on words, but on things. Thus it makes no sense to put articles into categories like Category:Hindi loanwords, since the things categorized are not loanwords, just the words used to describe them. On the other hand List of Hindi loanwords is a perfectly acceptable article name.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nRedirecta handle many cases. If a category would only apply to a person and not an event, create a redirect for the person and add the person related categories there. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nThis is a discussion of categories like Category:1865 establishments in Pakistan and Category:1911 establishments in Turkey. Both are higly problematic names. The first is just plain egregious. The idea of a seperate Muslim state carved out of India was not proposed until 1930. The name Pakistan was not put forward until 1933. In 1865 there was a concept of a place called India. Most of it was British India, a territory of the British Empire. There were also hundreds of \"Princely States\" of various sizes from Hyderabad State down, and under various levels of British Protection. Beyond this there was also Portuguese India, mainly Goa, and French India. Last I checked the one thing in the category mentioned was located in Lahore, which was a city clearly in British India, part of the province of Punjab, which transcended the modern international bouandary. As it is from 1947 until 1970 we clearly categoize those things established in East Pakistan in Category:1947 establishments in Pakistan etc. We also have Category:1960 establishments in West Germany, East Germany by year establishments categorizes, also Yugoslavia, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, the Soviet Union, Mandatory Palestine, the Thirteen Colonies and probably a few more refering to now defunct categories. We have x year in Dahomey and a few similarly named categories as well. It seems to me the best course would be to categorize everything by where it was in the year it was established. This solves a lot of problems and avoids potential conflicts. Since these categories are clearly refering to the year involved it gives us a staight forward way to categorize things, and it makes it so we do not have to change categorize when boundaries change. It also allows for categorizing things such as sub-national entities that transcended modern boundaries. Thus we would categorize things established in 1910 in Lemburg (now Lvov) as being established in Austria-Hungary, since they were, and not in Ukraine, which makes no sense since a-there was no such place and b-the plurality of Lemburg's population was Polish. We have clearly recognized that we cannot retroactively call things \"Israel\" before that country was formed. This should be applied across the board. In the case of India, most of the stuff established in what is now Pakistan and Bangaldesh before 1947 is already in the India category. In the case of \"Turkey\" to the extent that that name was used before 1923 it was used as a synonym for the Ottoman Empire. However it would jus be too confusing to retroactively use Turkey for the Ottoman Empire, and we have clearly decided to use Ottoman Empire as the article on the place, so we should use Ottoman Empire to refer to the place during those times. This also avoids classifying as establishments in Romania things formed by ethnic Hungarian in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1917 or before, that now are located in Romania. This will avoid anarchronism and inaccuracy. It also makes it so we do not have to recategorize things when international boundaries change. I also think we should move toward having a set earliest year we categorize establishments by country. The extreme is Category:993 establishments in the Czech Republic which not only incorreclty calls the place a Republic, implies modern understandings of place nearly a century before they came to be, but also contains the only article anywhere in the Category:993 establishments tree. For Category:Educational institutions established in 1800 that is the first year we have the category, and for Populated places we only do by year back to 1500. I think we should agree to some year before which we do not do the establishments by country. I am thinking 1800 might be a good year, since much before that placing things in countries gets progressively trickier. However I think a fixed year would work.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI just remembered a related issue. With the currently used method of placing these categories into parent categories we take a category like Category:1911 establishments in Estonia and place a set of links on the category. This makes it so the category liks to th article Estonia. However in 1911 the thing we really should be linking to is Estonia Governorate, which covered only about half the area of modern Estonia. One option would be to try to use different names in the categories, but that would probably just create confusion, especially in a case like Category:1910 establishments in Romania. With Category:1910 establishments in Russia it might be worth using \"The Russian Empire\" as the name, but there is a strong argument that at the time \"Russia\" would have worked. It migth not be that big a deal. I guess we could still add manually on [[:Category:1910 establishments in Russia\" a header that says \"This is for things established in 1910 in the Russian Empire\" but I am not sure how to do that and deal with the current header being placed there. I am not even sure if I am explaining this so people understand the problem. The problem is that currently there is something linking to Russia which is the article on the modern nation state.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nOne more set of thoughts. As long as we have Category:1960 establishments in Yugoslavia and Category:1911 establishments in the Ottoman Empire it seems we have a clear consensus to at least categorize by the place name at the time. There are two issues here. 1-does it make sense to categorize by both the current place name and the place name at the time. I would say no, because the current place name came change, the place name at the time is fixed. Also, at least at present we have Germany, Russia and Romania categories from years when Germany, Russia and Romania included places that they do not now include.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nWe currently have Category:1905 establishments in India which is being used to categorize all establishments in places that were then considered India, including in what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh. In the same way Category:1955 establishments in Pakistan includes things established in what is now Bangladesh. I really do not see any way to avoid that going on with Pakistan in 1955. However some people have suggested that we should rename the India categories before 1947. I personally think that the fact that at the time the place was called India should control our usage. However, we do use Category:1911 establishments in the Ottoman Empire despite the fact that in 1911 the common name for the Ottoman Empire in the English speaking world was \"Turkey\" and maps would show \"Turkey\" as streching from the Adriatic on the west to the Persian Gulf in the east and into the Arabian Peninsula in the south. I guess there are lots of questions, but one seems to be, is common name about the common name at the time or the common name for the thing as described historically at present?John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nHaving categories seems like a good idea, but I never use them. On the other hand, the category wars soak up a ton of editing time. I pretty much avoid the whole business, yet it wastes my time just for the noise it creates in my watchlist articles. Can someone provide serious cost-benefit analysis that they are worth the overhead? --Hobbes Goodyear (talk)\n\nOoow! Bold words! Categories are used but are visited to a far lesser extent than articles. I had a look at evolution and Category:Biological evolution for October as an example of usage. They were visited 220,000 and 1200 times respectively. Categories are too firmly entrenched to simply get rid of them. As for the cost benefit analysis, it is a good point but as volunteers we do what we want to do rather than what needs doing. Unfortunately. -- Alan Liefting (talk - contribs)\n\nI was not aware of significant category wars. Tim! (talk)\n\nThey can be confusing because 'Category:X' and 'List of X' accomplish more or less the same thing. Given the choice I'd prefer the category. Fuddle (talk)\n\nWhat is the rationale behind categories like Category:1990s television series? The category isn't applied consistently and there are beginning and ending categories for each year.Fuddle (talk)\n\nHi - I have a question for this project regarding the 'Sports people from location' categories. My understanding has always been that they are intended as a way of sub dividing 'People from location' categories - is that the case? On that basis their inclusion criteria would be defined as 'people born in place x who are notable for their sporting career' would it not?\n\nI'm asking because an editor has been through and added the categories pertaining to players from sports teams in a location to the 'sports people from' category for a number of UK cities. EG he's added Category:Manchester United F.C. players to Category:Sportspeople from Manchester. By my understanding of the inclusion criteria, this is a complete misnomer as the vast majority of the people in the 'players' category are not from Manchester - they were not born there or in many cases have ever even lived there, they merely worked there - often for a very short period. I've asked him for the MOS guidelines for his justification for this but he just claims 'that's the way it is' - my feeling is this is a unilateral thing he's taken upon himself to do and it's not been largely noticed because categories are rarely on people's watchlists.\n\nSome clarification from this project would be appreciated. Thanks. Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nCategory:Adnanites has 21 references and a diagram under the section heading \"Reliable references\" - basically a genealogy. I'm also wondering about the articles in this category - is it enough that the article claims that the subject is a descendant of Muhammad to be in this category, as that is the only rationale I can see for some of the bios as they don't mention Adnan anywhere. Dougweller (talk)\n\nNot that much! References belong in articles rather than on category pages. I moved the content to Adnanites. I didn't check the sources, but the number of incoming links indicate that it is a genuine subject. – Fayenatic London\n\nThanks very much, that makes sense. I don't deal with categories as much as I probably should. Am I right in thinking that an article that doesn't have a reliable source saying that the subject is an Adnanite shouldn't be in the category? Or is alleged descent enough? Dougweller (talk)\n\nIn the end everything should be verified if it's liable to be debated. I see Elijah is currently in the category; Banu Hothail explains why, but the only citation for that is in Arabic, which I can't read... moreover, another editor has just removed it. I left a note on Talk:Banu Hothail but will take it up at Adnanites. – Fayenatic London\n\nAt Talk:Amanda Righetti someone has cited me to this place to say we should categorize by place of birth. I am fairly certain I have read a statement that says that in general the place of birth is not alone worth categorizing, that we should categorize people by where they were raised, not where they were born. If someone could help me find this information, and maybe even point this out on the talk page involved that would be helpful.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nThis is aligned to the issue I raised about the 'Sportspeople from...' categories further up the page. Having read the MOS info on categorisation I was very surprised to discover that the 'People from...' categories are supposed to infer residence not place of birth because that's deemed not notable. I has always assumed it referred to birth, I'm pretty sure that 95% of editors who put people in those categories believe it to be birth and that most casual readers would expect the same.\n\nThere are various problems with this interpretation:\n\nif place of birth is not notable then why is it included in the info box of every biographical article?\n\nI'd suggest POB being notable specifically because most towns make a big thing of their 'favourite sons' - Sheffield Town Hall has a 'walk of fame' area outside with plaques commemorating famous Sheffielders - and these are people born in Sheffield, not someone who happened to live there for a while\n\nI don't know of anyone who would ever describe themselves as being 'from' the place they live unless they were born there. Coming 'from' somewhere infers birth in the English speaking world. I was born and raised in Sheffield but have lived and worked in Leeds but I'd never say I was 'from' Leeds. If asked 'where I was from' I might say that 'I live in Leeds but I was born in Sheffield' but would never associate myself as being 'from Leeds' - and I don't think anyone else would either.\n\nThis is important because one editor is insisting that any player for a local sports team eg Sheffield United should be included in the 'Sportspeople from Sheffield' category and therefore the 'People from Sheffield' category because of their supposed association with the city. This is ludicrous - the majority of these players were born and raised elsewhere (many of them not even in England), most of them only played for the club for one year or less and increasingly you couldn't even claim residence as most of the players live in the more upmarket rural towns and villages around the city and commute in. To suggest they should be included due to their association with Sheffield makes no sense and is confusing to the casual reader - not least because on that basis most of them would be in 5-10 different 'sportspeople from' categories. Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nWell, that may not be universal. In the US, the places where you lived are commonly where you are from if people ask. The other issue is that birthplace can be by accident if it occurs early and unexpected. How do we categorize someone born on a boat? Do we have a category for the ship or the cruse line? The birthplace is not defining. What can be defining are the places where someone grew up which can affect the persons later life. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nFirst off, let's not use \"notable\" here as the inclusion standard, because that's regarding whether a subject merits an article. Whether a verifiable fact merits inclusion in an article is a completely different question (generally under the standard \"relevant\" or \"nontrivial\"), and whether a verifiable fact merits categorization is a third question (generally under the standard \"defining\" or \"significant\").\n\nWe do not permit categories for every fact contained within articles. WP:OCAT is our general guideline on this point, but the basic issue is that the more category tags that are applied to an article, the more they just become clutter and thus less useful.\n\nBirthplace, if verifiable, should always be noted within an article. That doesn't mean it's significant enough to merit categorization, however. Many people never lived in the city where they were born (myself included), or never lived there long.\n\nHowever, the \"people from FOO\" categories have always been inclusive (or poorly defined, if you prefer) as far as what \"from\" means. Generally you can be confident that it would not include someone who merely visited a place, but would include more than just people who are most known for being from that place and/or achieved their biggest accomplishments there. So the middle between those two points is rather vast, and really should just be dealt with on a case by case basis.\n\nRegarding the Sheffield players, if their only connection to the place is through the team, I'd think it would be sufficient (and hopefully uncontroversial) to include the team players category as a subcategory of the sportspeople from Sheffield category. postdlf (talk)\n\nFurther to what postdlf has written, this is what it says in WP:DEFINING: \"Often, users can become confused between the standards of notability, verifiability, and 'definingness'. Notability is the test that is used to determine if a topic should have its own article. This test, combined with the test of verifiability, is used to determine if particular information should be included in an article about a topic. Definingness is the test that is used to determine if a category should be created for a particular attribute of a topic. In general, it is much easier to verifiably demonstrate that a particular characteristic is notable than to prove that it is a defining characteristic of the topic.\" Place of birth is verifiable; it is generally not defining. Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nOK - leaving aside the notability bit I'd still disagree with the 'sportspeople' category inclusion. Take John Egan - he played one game for Sheffield United, whilst spending a month on loan at the club. During this time he didn't live in Sheffield, the one game he played wasn't even in Sheffield and people barely remember that he was ever at the club. He qualifies for the 'Sheffield United players' category but there is no logical reason to include him in the 'People from Sheffield' or 'Sportspeople from Sheffield' category which by placing the players category within the latter infers he is. By sub categorising in this way he gets automatically bundled up with people from Sheffield. On this basis many footballers would be put in about 20 'sportspeople from' categories which is nonsensical. I'm not attempting just to troll on this it just feels very bizarre - if those are to be the criteria then the category should be called 'Associated with' or similar, not 'From...' surely? Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nI would have to agree with you on that player example. While some sports players do live in a nearby community and are active and notable contributors to that community, not all are. I don't how you can argue that anyone who 'passes through' is from an area. If you have someone who was in a military family, can you say that they are from the 12 places they lived in before they went away to college? Military families tend to move every year or two so they lack roots for this part of their lives. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nI think the issue is that most 'Person from...' or 'Sportsperson from' categories have no description and the category criteria is not well defined. The consensus at WP:Football is that the 'Foo F.C. players' categories should not be placed within either 'sportspeople from' or 'people from' categories as this is both confusing and largely incorrect. Individually if a player was born and raised within the boundaries of the same town / city then they'll be placed in the relevant category on their own merit, not lumped together as part of a whole category. Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nI think we make a mistake in trying to treat the category structure too strictly as a tree instead of a network of associations. I'd expect to find a category for the players of a team in FOO in a \"Sportspeople from FOO\" category, and it's a useful connection to have to be able to browse directly from one category to the other. It would also make it a completely moot issue as far as whether any of the individual FOO team players should be directly categorized as \"sportspeople from FOO\". Seriously, what readers would reasonably infer absolute statements of fact from category hierarchies when the higher-level categories are not actually part of the article content? I think most readers would understand that placing the \"Team FOO\" in the \"from FOO\" category did not necessarily mean the players had a connection to FOO outside of the team. Plus, where someone works in the profession for which they achieved notability (or at least where they played home games) is not exactly a trivial association. postdlf (talk)\n\nBut WP:Categorization#Subcategorization states that a category within a category should be deemed a sub category - thus \"When making one category a subcategory of another, ensure that the members of the first really can be expected (with possibly a few exceptions) to belong to the second also.\" - Therefore placing players categories in these sports/people from categories would expect that the people within them could independently be placed in the upper 'people from category' which in 95% of case they wouldn't. Bladeboy1889 (talk)\n\nThat's really not a response to the substance of what I said about this particular issue. Guidelines are not statutes to be invoked in the abstract and applied mechanically without regard to arguments for not doing so; they are guidelines, \"best treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply.\" So any comment on what I said? postdlf (talk)\n\nMy general view is that people should not be categorized as from a place if they moved away from the place before about the age of three. This is easy to follow when the article says they did so. The bigger frustration is lots of articles just give their birth and say nothing else about what they did or where they lived until they were 25 or older. I really don't feel up to removing the categorization of such articles by place of birth, since a lot of those people did stay where they were born. However if the article says they moved to some other city at age one than I feel confident in removing a categorization by their place of birth.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nThe reverse of how long a person has to live in a place after birth to be \"from\" there, is even more difficult. I generally assume if they attended college in a place, that alone does not make them from there. If they held a political office such as member of a city council or mayor in a place, they are clearly from there. Beyond that, I think it is really hard to decide. Also, dieing in a place does not show someone was from there.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion at village pump about the \"defining\" requirement for categories. Click here to view. --Noleander (talk)\n\nFrom discussion at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2013 January 23#Category:Eastman School of Music alumni, it seems that we have a bunch of categories in the style of Category:Eastman School of Music alumni and Category:University of Paris alumni (with \"alumni\" last) vs. Category:Alumni of Bangor University and Category:Alumni of the Académie Julian (with \"alumni\" first).\n\nThis is not helpful to our readers, nor to editors using Hotcat and other categorisation tools. How should we resolve this, to ensure greater consistency?\n\nShould we move all categories to one or another style? Should we have redirects in all cases (a job for a bot, perhaps)?\n\nDoes this affect other types of categories?\n\nPersonally I think we should use x alumni in all cases. It is clear enough, and it makes it so the categories start with the name of the place involved with makes it a lot easier to order them. It also makes it easier to start typing in the name of the place and see what subcats exist when using hot cats. It is also the form one sees in the United States, for example alumni associations are named \"x university alumni association\". I cannot say if elsewhere such groups use such names.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI agree. X alumni is the best style to use. The phrasing also avoids any \"of/in/from\" potential issues, makes intuitive sense, and has the HotCat advantage John Pack Lambert mentioned. I don't know what absolute numering is, but I tend to see it more than the other way. I don't think creating new redirects is necessary, because I would hope that users are going to the parent institution's category to see what the existing subcats are before they create a new one. – Philosopher Let us reason together.\n\n\"X alumni\" is fine (to the extent any such categories should exist – \"where I went to university\" isn't a defining characteristic of anyone but a very recent graduate with no professional experience yet, and ergo no likely notability yet either). There's generally no reason to use longer constructions, and when there may be in some rare case, just make an exception (e.g. Category:Players of English billiards being an exception to the normal \"Category:Sport-name players}}\" convention, without anyone's head exploding). — SMcCandlish Talk⇒ ɖ⊝כ⊙þ Contrib.\n\n\"Alumni of\" is the much clearer and less likely to be ambigious configuration, IMHO. - The Bushranger One ping only\n\nUse one or the other universally. I don't particularly care which, but \"FOO alumni\" is shorter. Categories are not meant to necessarily be phrased like sentences. If all the alumni categories are phrased as in FOO alumni, I doubt there would be much confusion as to what it means. Right now all the UK ones use \"Alumni of FOO\", which is fine, but it is inconsistent with most of the others. Avoiding \"Alumni of FOO\" has the benefit of completely avoiding the issue of whether it needs to be \"Alumni of THE FOO\" or just Alumni of FOO\" in any given cases (I can think of dozen of examples where there would be fights over this issue). Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nRepeating my comments from the last time someone raised this:\n\nThis was originally formed several years ago when setting up and standardising the university categories and a division opened up (and was generally maintained by CFD) between countries on this, mainly with the British, Irish, Sri Lankan and Hong Kong categories going one way and most other countries going the other. Part of the divide may be different preferences for title order between countries but a particular problem is that \"Institution Name alumni\" can produce awkward sounding results when the institution name is punctuated, especially when it's part of a larger institution. There are quite a number of such cases in the UK, particularly Oxbridge colleges where the name is \"Foo College, Oxbridge\", and also some of the University of London colleges where the current branding is \"Foo, University of London\". Ireland has similar cases such as \"Trinity College, Dublin\". (Sri Lanka and Hong Kong don't appear to have these forms so I'm not sure why precisely the categories went the way it did when other Commonwealth countries didn't.) As these were amongst the earliest with categories the form was naturally copied by others.\n\nAt a random glance of other English speaking countries with lots of such categories, Canada, Israel, New Zeland, Pakistan and South Africa don't have any such institution names to cope with, whilst Australia only has a couple. The US categories are harder to glance browse (although I remember you once produced a monster of a multi-hyphenated name). India has several within the collegiate Universities of Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Mumbai. Without looking too indepth, it's my impression that such problematic institution names are also rare in at least the English names for many other countries' universities.\n\nAny general discussion in this area will need to take in the universities as well but it will need to give explicit thought to institutions with such names that don't easily fit.\n\nTimrollpickering (talk)\n\n\"Alumni of\" has one virtue. Many editors or a few hard-working robots put categories in alphabetical order or nearly so. Category names such as Alumni of (the) FOO, Members of (the) FOO, People from (the) FOO, and Winners of (the) FOO ensure that cats of those kinds are displayed together when the entire list is alphabetically ordered. That makes them easier to ignore, or to find. --P64 (talk)\n\n\"FOO alumni\" would lead to automatic alphabetization. I don't see how \"Alumni of FOO\" is more effective at that. Assuming that no sorting is done for either, then everything goes under \"A\" for \"Alumni of FOO\".. This is not an issue with \"FOO alumni\". Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nMost alumni categories have two parents: one is a broader categ of alumni, and the other is a categ relating to the university (usually \"Foo University people\" or \"People associated with Foo University\"). Whichever format we use here \"Foo alumni\" or \"Alumni pof Foo\"), one of those parents will require a sort key.\n\nSee for example Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford. It is currently in: [[Category:People associated with the University of Oxford]] and [[Category:Alumni by university or college in England|Oxford]]. If we renamed it to Category:University of Oxford alumni, we'd need to sort the other parent: [[Category:People associated with the University of Oxford|Alumni]] and [[Category:Alumni by university or college in England|Oxford]].\n\nSo there is no net gain wrt sorting. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nThat is true, if there are two parents. Many have two parents, but many others do not have a related parent for the applicable university. So on balance, there is what you could call a \"net\" advantage to the \"FOO alumni\" form, taking into account those categories that only have the one parent. But it is admittedly minor, and I don't see that sorting convenience should really be a major factor at all. I was just responding to what I saw as moderately backwards logic. Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nPrefer \"Alumni of Foo\", but probably oppose further standardisation, because this is not as simple as it first appears.\n\nAndy Mabbett makes a good case that our readers and editors are ill-served by having two standards. Usage is currently split between British English and American English, and this also leads to disputes about which variation of English predominates in the region where a particular institution is located. So standardisation on one or other format could help.\n\nMy strong preference is that any new std format should be \"Alumni of Foo\". If we were simply dealing with multiple cases of \"foo\" as a single short word, modified on by \"alumni\" then I would agree with those who point of that \"foo alumni\" is shorter and avoids any need to consider whether we should use \"alumni of foo\" or \"alumni of the foo\". However, \"foo\" is rarely a single word, and in many cases it is a long phrase; and similar categories exist for academics/faculty, people-associated with, etc.\n\nSo what we are dealing with here is not simply how to label categories alumni, but how to label the many different categories of topics associated with each university or college. The alumni are in fact a single instance of the many types of category we have for university people, so we are really looking at a more generalised question of whether to use \"Foo Bar\" or \"Bar of Foo\". Consider for example California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. We currently have:\n\nCategory:California State Polytechnic University, Pomona people\n\nCategory:California State Polytechnic University, Pomona alumni\n\nCategory:California State Polytechnic University, Pomona faculty\n\nIn each case we have a long name, followed by a modifier (people/alumni/faculty). This is a perverse order: there are many possible modifier words, each of which is short, but in order to see which particular modifier is used by this category, the reader first has to read a verbose name. It is much easier to parse these phrases if we use the \"Bar of Foo\" format, with the short modifier at the start\n\nCategory:People associated with California State Polytechnic University, Pomona\n\nCategory:Alumni of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona\n\nCategory:Faculty of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona\n\nThe Cal State example is actually a relatively simple one. If we look for example at Category:People associated with the University of Oxford, there are numerous sub-categories of people, including:\n\nCategory:Alumni of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Academics of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Administrators of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Heads of colleges of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Public Orators of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Chancellors of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford\n\nCategory:Pro-Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford\n\nIf we invert the order of the first of these categories, then we create inconsistency with the others, which will also confuse readers and editors.\n\nNote that Oxford is far from being the only university with such a proliferastion of categories. There is a similar situation at Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, and countless other major universities.\n\nIf we tackle this piecemeal, all we will achieve is to shift the inconsistency into another field. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nIf we can agree that having two different formats in the alumni categories is at least somewhat of an issue, wouldn't it be logical therefore to change the format of all of the academic people categories, not just the alumni ones? I really can't see any good justification for keeping some one way and others the other way. And we shouldn't hesitate to change the alumni ones merely because it leads us to also consider the faculty ones, the presidents ones, the chancellors ones, and so forth. Tackling the issue would actually be progress! Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nYes, we should probably look at all these things to together. One point which occurs to me when re-reading my examples above is that if we use the \"foo bar\" format for alumni/presidents/faculty/chancellors/academics/etc, then there is no clear separator between the name of the university and the second noun. This noun-noun format is hard to parse. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nThe change in caps can help when it's \"faculty\" or \"alumni\", but some users might want to capitalize things like \"Presidents\". No doubt this is a messy issue. I can see the benefits of both formats. I could lean towards the \"FOO of BAR\" format if I didn't think that that format would create a whole new set of problems with debates over when to include the word \"the\" before \"BAR\". Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nI see your point about \"FOO of BAR\" vs \"FOO of the BAR\" ... but that issue occurs too with universities in the British English zone, and I am not aware of it having been a difficult point to resolve. AFAICS, the general rule is that we need a \"the\" when the institution is the \"X of Y\". So we have \"Alumni of Foo University\" and \"Alumni of the University of Bar\". That may need more checking, but I think that's the general rule. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nIn some forms of American English, it's common for people to say \"BAR of the FOO University\", as in \"Faculty of the Texas A&M University\", so I'm not if it would be super clear cut or not. The issue might also arise when the name of the university is in a different language, especially if that language does not use articles like \"the\". Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nIs academia special? Why do we have Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association. The ASA has titled these people President and PASA may be a novelty as I write it here --unlike, say Category:Members of the European Parliament, whose singular form seems to be an official title and its abbreviation MEP established.\n\nDo we have Category:Newbery Medal winners and Category:Winners of the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival Film Grand Prix because the former honor has a short name and the latter has a long name? If so, that is a good reason, maybe a sufficient to depart from a general practice, if we have one.\n\n--P64 (talk)\n\nThat could have been the thinking of those who created the categories, but I don't think there's a guideline or anything that suggests doing it this way (or either way). I imagine the point of contention would likely be over the dividing line between \"short\" and \"long\". Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nI do know that with the American universities we have categories like Category:Presidents of Brigham Young University, Category:Presidents of Harvard University and so forth while we also have Category:Harvard University alumni and such. I think the reason for this is that in the case of the presidents they hold the title \"President of Harvard\" and so it is an office category, while the alumni category is not of the holders of a limited office. I actually think it would be a lot better to call the category Category:Oxford University alumni, it is way shorter and less wordy than they current Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford. I also think most Americans would find Category:Alumni of the University of Michigan too wordy and pretentious sounding. The current Category:University of Michigan alumni is 5 letters shorter. The current form also avoids any of/in/at/from disputes.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nThe advantage is even more extreme in the people categories. Category:Harvard University people is so much simpler of a name than Category:People associated with the University of Oxford. If it was Category:Oxford University people it would be so much shorter. Admitably Category:John F. Kennedy School of Government people is not short, but I don't think we want Category:People assocaited with the John F. Kennedy School of Goverment, and there I can see \"the\" people a major bone of contention.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nI hate to point this out, because I really do like the \"x alumni\" form, but with a category like Category:University of Michigan alumni vs Alumni of the University of Michigan, you actually only start having places where you do not need the sort key with the later form, because currently you need to sort key to Michigan in categories where you are not sorting by alumni.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nThere may be some categories, such as possible libarians, where Category:Harvard librarians means any libarian employed by Harvard (why we do not use University in that category is another question, we probably should) but Category:Librarians of Harvard University, might be limited to the head librarian of Harvard. Oddly enough though Category:Harvard Fellows is possibly more restictive than Category:Fellows of Harvard,, since the not all people holding fellowships connected with Harvard are Harvard Fellows. Of course in this particular case we actually could also name a category Category:Harvard fellows. I am not sure if all the people in Category:Harvard Fellows were actually Harvard Fellows, some may have just held fellowships at Harvard.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nKeep status quo – I would personally object strongly to 'Foo alumni' being imposed on UK categories but have no great interest in interfering with the name of Category:California State Polytechnic University, Pomona alumni (as I assume that Americans are accustomed to parsing such monstrosities). I see this as an EngVar variation. Redirects might be workable. Oculi (talk)\n\nI have not seen anyone present any evidence that there is actually different usage in different places. I guess there is the BYU Alumni association, and my general sense is this is standard American usage to names thins x alumni association. However I have not seen anyone present evidence that there are British organizations named the other way around. In fact this website [1] seems to be using the form \"Oxford alumni\" which suggests to me that British usage tends toward Oxford Univeristy alumni and not the other way around.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nIf we really want to keep the status quo (and I'd prefer standardisation myself) we should surely use whatever the term is at that institution? For example, my (English) university uses \"Foo alumni\", so, to my mind, that should be the form used for the category. Which currently, it isn't, so if there's any imposition going on, it's the other way around than Oculi suggests. There may, of course, be institutions where this isn't the case, but I think we need to see which ones they are, and how common they might be. Anaxial (talk)\n\nDespite what Oculi says, there is no evidence that this is an WP:ENGVAR issue. It seems to be a matter of personal preference of individual editors. There is no reason that these should not be consistent across all categories, either one way or the other. Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nCategory:Energy has a link to Energy and society that needs to be removed. It is a redir. -- Alan Liefting (talk - contribs)\n\nFixed. I elected to delete that link altogether since the redirect target was not categorized there. In addition I did not think it would be an appropriate member. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nJust as we have e.g. Category:Articles with dead external links from August 2010, should templates like {{Wikisourcelang}} or {{Sister project links}} add the articles that feature these templates (or relevant parameters within them) to e.g. Category:Articles with links to Wikisource? It Is Me Here t / c\n\nUser:Eraalickaj/sandbox contains content cats. -- Alan Liefting (talk - contribs)\n\nRan into this when I ran into one of these classified as a house. Many US fire stations provide living facilities in the station, especially in places where firefighters are at the station for longer shifts, like 24 hours. They live at the station when not out on calls so they sleep and eat their meals there. So this raises the question, should these be included under a parent of Category:Houses or Category:Residential buildings? I'm not sure that this is common enough to justify adding a parent like the ones suggested and would it apply to all of the older buildings we have articles on or is this a more modern phenomenon? Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nBy their nature categories need to focus on the major topic of an article and in this case it is firehouse (fire station) rather than house. -- Alan Liefting (talk - contribs)\n\nI just came across Category:Words and phrases by language.\n\nIt's a strange hotchpotch of a container category, and I have proposed some changes at Category talk:Words and phrases by language#Cleaning_up_this_category.\n\nComments welcome. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nI am trying to better understand the concept of \"Standard biographical information\" as it relates to categorization (and over-categorization)... my question is inspired by reading this CfD from 2005, and this CfD from a few days ago. I am not questioning the results (I agree with them)... I am trying to better understand the thinking behind the comments made.\n\nFrom reading the CfD's, there seems to be a solid consensus that birth days are too trivial for categorization (and are better handled as a list) but that birth years are not too trivial for categorization. I am not \"challenging\" that consensus. However, I don't really understand it. I understand the rational against categorizing by day of birth... but I don't understand the rational for categorize by year of birth. To me, they are the same... and all the arguments against categorizing by day of birth are valid for categorizing by year of birth. So what am I missing? Why do we listify birth days... but categorize birth years? Blueboar (talk)\n\nIt seems to me that a person's year of birth is of long-term relevance, as it places them in the historical era in which they live or lived. My experience with Facebook tells me that birthdays are of great interest to social media addicts, but they do that mainly so they can send birthday greetings to their online connections. The fact that Joe and Amy share a birthday is fundamentally just trivia. I can't see how a category that lists people who were born on (for example) January 15 in years ranging from 800 C.E. to 1993 would be anything more than trivia. --Orlady (talk)\n\nI agree with Orlady on this. Year of birth groupings place people in a broad historical context. Day of birth is pretty trivial in comparison. For what purposes could it possibly be important to group people by birthday, especially if the person is dead. Astrological analyses? Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nAlso: copyright. Being able to query \"all the artist who died in 1942\" enables me, for example, to find recently out-of-copyright works.\n\nSeems like some editors are proposing to replace some toolserver functions with categories. The discussion is here. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nIn the reaction the the hullabaloo about Category:American women novelists someone has asked me why we split large categories. Since I am not as gungho about this as some others, I really do not see a call to try splitting most categories that get over 200 pages the way some do, I thought I would bring the discussion here and ask.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nYes, I brought up this question, specifically after I encountered a reader who expressed that they wanted to be able to browse an enormous category of all American novelists. In the face of actual readers saying that large categories are useful, I find myself questioning the conventional wisdom that large categories are not useful, and should necessarily be broken up. How do we know that readers don't want large categories, or for that matter, how do we know readers don't want redundancy between parent and daughter categories? -GTBacchus(talk)\n\nIt's a recursive problem. If you put the children in the parent, do you put the parent in the grandparents? And so on? If users want to see the full recursive sub-contents of any given categories there are tools that give that to them.--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nWe split most large categories because most users find that enormous lists are not navigable. Faced with a category that contains thousands of pages, most people look at the first page and then leave. Look at Category:Stub-Class medicine articles for a minute. There are more than 13,000 pages listed there. We need them to be there (that's why the cat isn't split), but do you realistically think you could find what you were looking for in a cat that size? Pages starting with the letter B don't appear until the seventh page. Who do you think would actually get there, much less to page #66? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nStub categories are kind of different, it seems to me. The reader I was thinking of was talking about American Novelists, and how they liked the long list to browse alphabetically. Even so, what's the evidence that \"most readers find that enormous lists are not navigable?\" Is this an assumption, or empirical?\n\nObiwan, I'm not aware of these tools. What are they, and how do we expect readers to know about them? -GTBacchus(talk)\n\nIt's the fundamental law of the web: every single click costs readers.\n\nOrganizing it based on the alphabet is trivial: you just paste {{CategoryTOC}} into the cat page. But that's worthless if your goal is to browse for something that looks interesting or something whose name you don't know but hope to recognize. (And if you did know the name, then why would you look in the cats rather than use the search tool?) WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nJust my two cents: There really is no need to split every large category. I think that the tendancy to want to split them causes for some very unnecessary subcategorization. Subcategorization just for the sake of subcategorization does not produce any more helpful organization than just having a large category. Perhaps if there are any very good reasons why large categories are inconvenient, then we could find a good way to subcategorize them alphabetically, and leave it at that.Greg Bard (talk)\n\ni am someone who prefers entire large categories because of the way my memory works -- i will have some fragment in my mind, like the first syllable of a writer's last name, or i remember it starts either with a B or a P or a V, but i know it's an american novelist (but not whether it was a male or a female or a gender-neutral name). if i can look at the whole list i can quickly scroll through and scan for matches; if i have to page and page and page it's frustrating to useless, and if the author is diffused into some category i don't even know then i won't ever find it unless i do different, individual searches, which is less efficient for me and more demanding of the database. i have no idea how common this search method is. i concur that long lists present navigation problems. however, i think it's a bad idea to split off subcategorization solely for navigational purposes; it should be a content matter. navigation needs to be handled externally to content. because seriously, 200 pages is already 10 times too many to be useful; heck, 20 is a lot. piranha (talk)\n\nBut Category:American novelists is already a subcategory - at a higher level there are the likes of Category:Novelists, Category:American fiction writers, Category:American writers, Category:American people, Category:Writers and even Category:People. Obviously some of these can be easily dismissed but others are harder cases - at exactly what point do you draw the line, novelists, fictional writers or writers? Timrollpickering (talk)\n\nThere will also be people who say \"I know it's a British mystery writer\" or \"I'm sure it was a woman\". We can accommodate both types through duplication: all American novelists in the American novelists cat plus listing each author in every appropriate subcat. I'm just not sure that we'd all be happy with the result. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI would not support any large scale change before we find out what will happen with the search phase of wikidata. With that it may well be possible to ask:\n\nperson=female\n\ncountry=United Kingdom\n\nprofession=writer\n\nxxx...\n\nThat would render moot discussions over how to categorize for searching. Since that database was built knowing that a search feature would be there, the searches should be simple and reasonably quick. They will not be constrained by the category structure. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\ni am not really arguing for any specific solution at this point; i am just providing a datapoint for usefulness of large categories, since the argument was made that american women novelists were being split from american novelists because that category was too large for navigational purposes, and people should therefore be diffused into numerous subcategories. i consider that a bad argument, because ghettoization results from gender and ethnic diffusion, while the subcategories still remain much too large for easy visual navigation. i don't know where to draw the line either, and in principle i would prefer not to draw any, since there is value in analysis of even very large categories. when it comes to more targeted searches i prefer keywords (cf Vegaswikian above); i don't know that hierarchical categorization is helping me here much at all -- but i am new to this area and need to do more reading on how categories and lists are used here. piranha (talk)\n\nFor me the main utility of splitting large categories is so that you can better categorize things. If every single novelist is in Category:American novelists, how do you know which ones would still need to be categorized at a more specific level? Take a look at Category:American politicians - it has been fully diffused. Would you prefer to every single politician there? Much better to keep it diffused, then when someone adds a new politician and slots it into the category, they stand out like a sore thumb and can be diffused. I agree with Vegas - let's see what wikidata search brings. That would essentially end up with massive categories (e.g. all writers, all americans, all men), but you would always be searching across a set of intersecting parameters that could be arbitrary.--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nRaised at WP:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2013_April_29#Category:Inventions_by_country. Your contributions are welcomed. Andy Dingley (talk)\n\nSee [2] for the previous discussion on whether to classify a university's alumni as:\n\n\"University of Foo alumni\"\n\n\"Alumni of the University of Foo\"\n\nMaintain status quo, which is different for each university.\n\nThe consensus appears to be in favor of standardization, i.e. to prefer one of the first two options, and to change noncompliant categories to reflect the new standardization. There was a dissenter on this point.\n\nThe consensus within the first two choices appears to be the first choice, namely, \"University of Foo alumni\". BrownHairedGirl vigorously dissented but I think she is outnumbered. She correctly pointed out that if we make this change, we must also deal with \"University of Foo Presidents,\" \"University of Foo chancellors,\" and so on to avoid inconsistency.\n\nI must express a concern that the execution of this closure may be more trouble than it's worth. It will require hours of editor time for a very small incremendtal benefit to the readership of Wikipedia. Therefore, it may be advisable as a practical matter to ignore the apparent consensus for standardization and leave the status quo, unless there is a stronger push for standardization. Chutznik (talk)\n\nI agree with you that at the very least, there was consensus for standardization. Good Ol’factory (talk)\n\nI just thought of this issue. If Category:American novelists is a sub-cat of Category:American writers does this mean if we only had these two categories we should move Mark Twain from Category:American writers to Category:American novelists, or since Twain wrote things besides novels and is notable for it, should we leave him in both. Maybe a better example is with Category:American film actors and Category:American silent film actors. Do we move all those who acted in silent films just to the silent film category, or do we leave anyone who acted in a talking film in the parent as well, or do we move almsot everyone, except for those who had the majority of their career in films with sound.John Pack Lambert (talk)\n\nHehe - I've just been thinking about the same thing. I don't know - the pattern seems to be, put them in both. Odd, but probably the best solution. Can you imagine the howls if Twain was taken out of the novelists cat? --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nI can't give any examples offhand, but that's how I've been doing it, and how I've seen it in lots of older articles--lots of sideways categorization. If you have those categories, then that's how it goes. I've just updated Gerrit Komrij, a (dead) man of many talents: Category:Dutch poets, Category:Dutch essayists, Category:Dutch television critics, Category:Dutch literary critics, Category:Dutch encyclopedists, Category:Dutch dramatists and playwrights, Category:Dutch translators, Category:Dutch columnists, Category:Dutch novelists, Category:Dutch journalists. Don't even think about trimming that bunch. :) Obi, someone in the previous section asked you about \"tools\" but you never answered. I'm curious too. Thanks, Drmies (talk)\n\nYeah, that's another issue - is how many cats do you add? Let's say he wrote a poem - is he a dutch poet? I think we waver between massive overcategorization and massive undercategorization. We have very few standards, besides WP:DEFINING to help us. The tool is this one: [3] <== for example, that link shows you all American women poets who are not in American poets (thus, ghettoized.)--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nIn this case (you'll have to take my word for it since the article is sub-par) they're all justified, yes. He's also male and gay and dead and expatriate (moved to Portugal) and formerly of Amsterdam and poet laureate et cetera in all those categories... The link is not opening up right now; I suppose when it will I can do some playing around. How many categories--I use the same kind of rationale I use for including items in a bibliography, for instance: is it verifiable that a person is known for something. His TV criticism was published in a newspaper, originally, then republished as a collection (so those might could count as essays), which makes him a kind of journalist as well though \"columnist\" covers it just as good. But by that time we're really in sillyland. So, for TV criticism I could validate the category by pointing to coverage on his Horen, Zien en Zwijgen, of which there is plenty: how's your Dutch? But the article should bear that out, of course. I routinely remove categories that do not have such validation. In Filipacchi's case, for instance, the humor wasn't verified until I added a reference. Drmies (talk)\n\nIt seems the practice is to put a hatnote at the top of the category page linking to the associated article, then adding that article to the category which puts a link at the bottom of that page and adds an unnecessary (redundant) link to the article within the category list. I think it would be better not[–Editor P64] to put a hatnote to the category at the top of that article instead of adding it to the category. That removes the redundant link from the category list and distinguishes that category from any others the article might be added to. Joeldbenson (talk)\n\nActually a better argument is that the hatnote should be removed. The category is needed on the article to establish navigation to the eponymous named category. So the categorization of the article is critical. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nI'm not sure what you mean - can you point to an example? --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nIf you don't add the category to the main article, there will be no link in the main article to the category. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nI too deprecate a hatnote or a one-line preface that names the main article. Routinely a category needs a more substantial preface to explain what belongs.\n\nAs VW says, the main article does need to be in the category for navigation from the main article to the category. In the footer list of categories, preferred location for any main article categories (not limited to eponymous cat) is at the head of the list.\n\nIn the category-page list of pages in the category, preferred location is the very top --as we accomplish by sort key ' ' ahead of '+' which is ahead of '1' and 'A'\n\n--P64 (talk)\n\nJoeldbenson mentions using header and footer locations to distinguish main-article categories from all other categories (links to main-article categories at the head of the article; membership in other categories at the foot, which is no change). That distinction is one we might display within the current category list at the foot by using template {{cl}} for main article categories --prior to the list of membership in other categories. For instance, the Harry Potter Categories list now looks like this (abbreviated and without active links):\n\nCategories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Harry Potter (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nInstead it would look like this:\n\nCategories (++): Category:Harry Potter (−) (±) 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nIn effect this may be what Joeldbenson is for or against. In execution I consider it much superior to using a hatnote. --P64 (talk)\n\nI'm still confused by what you mean by hatnote. Is this the use of {{catmain|article name}} template? or something else? for me, a hatnote is the note on top of an article page. Also, I'm curious why you don't think the article should be in its main cat. Why ever not?--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nYes, the hatnote would apply to {{catmain}}. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nI guess in that case, are you saying we shouldn't use catmain? Or??? sorry I'm confused here. I personally like catmain, and wouldn't want to be rid of it.--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nMy feeling is that {{catmain}} should be done away with. It does not really add material information and leads to the confusion you raised. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nHmm. I wasn't confused about catmain, or what it does, I guess I was confused as to whether that's what y'all meant by hatnote. Catmain is great, and it allows multiple articles to be linked. More importantly, there are often cases where there are several articles you want to bubble up to the top using \"|*\" or whatever, but only one is the main article. Finally, when there are lots of subcats, catmain provides easy access to the lead article right from the top. In short, I see nothing wrong with it and a lot right.--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nIf I understand User:Joeldbenson correctly, the word \"not\" is a mistake above.\n\nExhibits A and B below are copied from my yesterday note above.\n\nMany of our articles have Category lists like this one which is quoted in part from the franchise article Harry Potter.\n\nExhibit A.\n\nCategories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Harry Potter (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nNothing distinguishes cat Harry Potter in this list, although the article's membership in that cat is distinctive. It's the main article of the category (and the cat is eponymous).\n\nJdb suggested this alternative using a hatnote at the top of the article:\n\nH.\n\n(in header) See also Category:Harry Potter.\n\n(in footer) Categories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nThe franchise article is not in the category, whose preface identifies it somehow. Navigation from article to WP:EPONCAT relies on the hatnote.\n\nTwenty hours ago I observed that if the main article will not be in the category we might provide navigation at the front of the list in the footer rather than in the header.\n\nB. (in footer)\n\nCategories (++): Category:Harry Potter (−) (±) 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nThe franchise article is not in the category, whose preface identifies it somehow.\n\nAlternatively that link from article to category might be located to provide this display in the footer:\n\nC. (two consecutive lines in footer)\n\nCategory:Harry Potter (−) (±)\n\nCategories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nor one of a zillion variations:\n\nC1. (two consecutive lines in footer)\n\nThis is the main article for Category:Harry Potter (−) (±)\n\nCategories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nThe franchise article is not in the category, whose preface identifies it somehow.\n\nWith revised software we might code two classes of categories and have a display along these lines:\n\nD.\n\nSpecial Categories: Harry Potter (−) (±)\n\nPlain Categories (++): 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nFinally we might distinguish category/s in which Harry Potter is main article merely by listing any such category/s before the others, preferably with the eponymous category, if any, first in the list.\n\nE.\n\nCategories (++): Harry Potter (−) (±) 1997 introductions (−) (±) Fantasy novel series (−) (±) Schools in fiction (−) (±)\n\nHere the franchise article is in cat Harry Potter. Some editors manually effect Exhibit E now. But some add new categories at the beginning of the list. Some re-arrange categories in alphabetical order. Robots might enforce this style.\n\n--P64 (talk)\n\nNote your samples show what hotcat displays and not what is normal. This likely confuses many readers and adds unnecessary length to the display which makes it longer. Vegaswikian (talk)\n\nFrom the guidance:\n\nA defining characteristic is one that reliable sources commonly and consistently define[1] the subject as having—such as nationality or notable profession (in the case of people), type of location or region (in the case of places), etc. For example, here: \"Caravaggio, an Italian artist of the Baroque movement ...\", Italian, artist, and Baroque may all be considered to be defining characteristics of the subject Caravaggio. A category embodies one or more defining characteristic—how this is achieved in practice is described in the following sections. (emphasis mine)\n\nThe way I've always interpreted this is, if we have a reliable source that says person X is a woman, and another reliable source that says person X is a poet, and a third that says X is American, then there is no problem with putting them in Category:American women poets - and then if we find a fourth source that says she is African-American from New York, then she can go to Category:African-American women poets and Category:Writers from New York. In other words, the question of DEFINING is whether that person has a particular characteristic/facet, and a given category can combine multiple characteristics, even if sources don't speak of them as having that exact combination. (Nb: One exception to this rule seems to be religion, whereby even if someone is Catholic, it doesn't mean they should be in Catholic baseball players or whatever - even if such a cat exists - the religion must be in some way closely related to their performance of that job).\n\nThis has all come to a head for obvious reasons, and someone recently claimed that for example some women should not be put into Category:American women novelists because not all sources refer to every women novelist as a women novelist, and this should be battled out bio-by-bio. I agree that from a sources perspective this is probably true, and not all sources refer to Charles Barkley as an African-American basketball player - he's just a great player - but if we have these categories, shouldn't we use them and fill them up? And if not, shouldn't they be deleted? I can see that for occupations, yes, if someone was a bus driver for a few weeks, that aspect of their life is not defining- but gender and ethnicity and many others would seem to be, meaning, you should be free to place someone in as many intersections as make sense, as long as the characteristic(s) that make up those intersections are indeed defining. There shouldn't be, IMHO, a lot of debate at an article level around a given intersection - if the intersection category itself is notable, then everyone who has those intersecting characteristics should be placed in it - otherwise the cat should be deleted.\n\nThis is what I see in practice, but I just want to see if others think this aligns with the guidance, and whether the guidance needs to be revised to be more in line with practice. As a more detailed look at this, please read this algorithm I came up with, and see if you agree or disagree with the resultant classification. --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nI would think this is to a large extent a question on how we define the intersection categories: if we have a category XY, does it contain all subjects that have both X and Y as a defining characteristic, or only those that explicitly have XY? This has to be decided at least on the level of each category, to give a basis for the decision made for each article. But there should also be a more general concept behind what we decide for each category. After all, the readers should have a good chance of getting the meaning of a category by just reading the title, without looking for detailed definitions. If the latter is necessary, then the usefulness of that category is questionable.\n\nP.S.: these thoughts are only valid for manually populated intersection categories. If some software tool says 'this is a list of articles that have both property X and property Y', then that's what it means. — HHHIPPO\n\nNo, my question is about manually populated categories - specifically, intersections as you point out. I think you put it nicely, but let's take a real-life example - Category:American women novelists - should there be any people who are (a) American, (b) women (identify as such) and (c) notable as novelists -- that should *not* be in that category - for example, if protective editors on a particular page edit-war to keep that bio *out* of that category, because they don't like it? That has been happening a lot recently... for example, editors are warring to keep Ernest Hemingway out of Category:American men novelists. I think when readers go to that page, they would expect to see a full list of every American male novelist that we have, no? That's what I would expect. My thought is, fill up a category with all those members for whom the attributes of the cat are defining (meaning, not everyone who was a bus driver ever should go in Category:Bus drivers by nationality) - otherwise, delete the category. --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk)\n\nHmm, do they give any real reasons, other than WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT? Maybe that Hemingway is in too many categories already? Which would lead us to the question: how many are too many? In any case I think, as you say, to keep the categorization consistent such a category has to either include all articles that fulfill the inclusion criteria, or none (and then be deleted). But where to draw the line? One could say something like \"If there's more than x articles that should be in category A, but then would be member of more than y categories, then category A should be deleted to avo"
