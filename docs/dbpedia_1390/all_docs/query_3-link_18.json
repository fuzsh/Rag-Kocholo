We had a lot of projects in mind that we thought that would display nicely on a bigger scale, allowing for even more intricate detail. With that idea we decided to set a sister Magna Historica line, but in 1/10!\n\nThe first bust of this line is frankly spectacular, even including photoetched parts for the rapier sword’s guard:\n\nMagna Historica 1/10\n\nMHS00001 – De Nederlandse Edelman, 1624\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 11 plus photoetched parts\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (May 15th)\n\nHi all!\n\nDue to diverse reasons, some related to the company and some other being of personal nature, many pending new releases had been delayed for a few weeks. We are happy to inform you all that we are resuming our usual rate of operation, and nothing better to celebrate it than showing you a pair of new cool figures! Let’s check them 😉\n\nFirst one is a new sculpture of Jonatán Monerris, the first 75 mm figure for his Peter Punk Produktions series. We took the chance and paid some homage with it to a good friend from the hobby…\n\nPeter Punk Produktions\n\nPPK00017 – Sergio Durán, Spanish Buccaneer, 1671\n\nSculpture: Jonatán Monerris\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 4\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nAlso, we have a very special new figure for one of our most popular historical lines!\n\nRevolution: Liberty or Death!\n\nREV00007 – George Washington, Valley Forge, 1778\n\nSculpture: Oriol Quin\n\nPainting: Javier Montero\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nAnd that’s all for now. We are happy to be back!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (March 27th)\n\nHi all!\n\nIt has been hard and time consuming but here we have finally the epic collection of Roman busts you were waiting for. Behold The Might of Rome!\n\nMagna Historica\n\nMHB00013 – Optio, Legio XX Valeria Victrix, Britannia, AD 61\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 11\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nMHB00014 – Centurion, Legio XX Valeria Victrix, Britannia, AD 61\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 6\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nMHB00015 – Signifer, Legio XX Valeria Victrix, Britannia, AD 61\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 14\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nAnd, of course…\n\nMHB01001 – The Might of Rome (Special limited edition of 60 boxed sets)\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 32 (including the 3 busts and the plaque)\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nRemember that the special edition boxed set is limited to only 60 units and only available on our website. Once it is gone, you still will be able to get the busts, but you’ll need to buy them separate and won’t come with the special plaque.\n\nNothing more to say… Hope you like it!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nThe Might of Rome or… These Romans are crazy!\n\nHi all\n\nAs you might have seen during these days if you follow us in our social media, we have gone completely bananas about Imperial Rome!\n\nThis is a project that has been carefully crafted for some time with the incredibly talented sculptor Ramón Martínez and the wild child of the brushes and local genius Marc Masclans, a true vignette of 3 busts of the same theme that can work together or individually. As you know, we always try to release miniatures with a twist, so we decided to set this command group of Imperial Roman soldiers in the days of the Iceni revolt in Britannia, led by the infamous Boudicca (wait a minute… I wonder in which side we are).\n\nWe have received an incredible response from the audience and many questions about the release date, format, etc…\n\nThe busts are the usual 1/12 scale busts we do on the Magna Historica line. They are an Optio, a Centurion and a Signifer from the Legio XX Valeria Victrix.\n\nTomorrow, we will make them available at our website, and you will be able to purchase them individually or as a limited edition boxed set of the three busts, only available in our online store at a special price:\n\nThe Might of Rome boxed set is aimed to those collectors who might want to get all the busts. For that reason, and as a courtesy to our beloved customers, its price will be around 20% lower than the global price of getting the busts individually. The set is strictly limited to 60 copies (you better keep your eyes open!) and will include:\n\n– The three busts.\n\n– A exclusive resin plaque with the latin inscription “Ad Astra per Aspera” (through the adversity to the stars) to be used on a bigger vignette base for the project.\n\n– A signed and numbered limited edition certificate.\n\nTomorrow we will reveal the final boxart pics in color and the busts will be released around 19h Central European Time, so set your alarms and do not miss this chance to get them 😉\n\nSoon more news!\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (March 21th) and some more…\n\nHi all!\n\nIt’s being a busy week! We have a new figure to release but we are also in the middle of some big project that will be out next week. OK, let’s get focused, hehehe. First of all the new release of this week, another classic from Elite Miniaturas that comes back in an all-new revised edition in resin:\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00007 – Lansquenet, 1525\n\nSculpture: Mike Blank\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 6\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nBesides this, we have started showing some sneak pics of a project we have been working on for some time:\n\nJust from the pics it is very difficult to tell what the subject might be, so it is somewhat a mysterious thing in which you’ll still need to do a lot of guessing (just joking). Check our Facebook or Instagram to learn more about it during these days. In any case, the busts will be available on our website next week.\n\nWe’ll update you on this very soon!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (March 9th)\n\nHi all!\n\nHere we have another release, this time something that many of you were waiting for when Matthieu showed a few pics of the sculpt some time ago… It has been a pleasure to paint this compact bust:\n\nNorthern Winds\n\nNOR00002 – Israel Hands, Honduras, 1718\n\nSculpture: Matthieu Rouèche\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 1\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nMore stuff coming soon!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (Feb 23th)\n\nHi all!\n\nAs we were saying last week, we have moved to a new format in what it comes to new releases. Due to the increasing number of miniatures we have planned to add to our catalogue, from now onward we are releasing them in a weekly basis instead of monthly. So, as promised, here is another release…\n\nThis time, we have another classic miniature from the legendary Elite Miniaturas and it seems we are starting re-releasing the long unavailable Franco-Prussian War collection!\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00006 – Lieutenant, 1st Zouave Regt\n\nSculpture: Stefano Cannone\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nThere will be another release next week, so stay tuned!\n\nBesides this, I would like to send a reminder about my upcoming seminars in Atlanta. Seats are beginning to run low on both! Let’s remind the details:\n\nSo if you are thinking on joining but you are still unsure, send an email to fer2018paint@gmail.com and you’ll get all details.\n\nTalk soon!\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (Feb 16th)\n\nHi all!\n\nYes, you guessed it, we have new releases! But before showing them to you, we would like to explain a small change of format we are going to try in the way we release new stuff. As you know, we use to make a several-miniatures release every month; that means we need to have everything ready for a certain moment (or as we call it, “the warp opening window of opportunity”). Let’s be really honest about it: it is a bit of stress for everyone involved as sometimes is really difficult to make all things concerning production, painting, design, etc. match at the same time. Add to that the increasing number of new releases we are having (and that we have planned for the year) and you get a situation in which that decisive monthly action involves every time more work and resources.\n\nSo, keeping in mind that we are a small company and our work resources are not unlimited, we have decided to release our new miniatures in a WEEKLY BASIS. It means that we’ll have the same amount of new miniatures, but instead of releasing, let’s say 5, in a particular day of the month, we are going to release them during the whole month. That way we’ll have all the time to concentrate on every single release and showcase it as it deserves, we will avoid delaying the whole release lot just because something is not ready and everything would be easier from a logistics point of view. Maybe one week we won’t release anything or maybe we release 2 figures, depending of the volume of things ready at that point, we’ll see.\n\nIn any case, just wanted to keep you all updated, as you know that communications with the customers are very important for us. Let’s check those new minis!\n\nFirst one is a nice Confederate Officer for Fahrenheit Miniature Project:\n\nFahrenheit Miniature Project\n\nFAH00017 – Confederate Artillery Officer, Gettysburg, 1863\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nThe second release is something we already have shown some previews about, but that now is fully available. This project is the first one of a collaboration between Romain Van Den Bogaert and Ben Komets:\n\nSignature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nROM00003 – Agvaldr Long-nose\n\nSculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nPainting: Ben Komets\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 32 (torso and head plus LOTS of fungus and mushrooms)\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nAs most of you know, Ben Komets has his very own venture running in the shape of a fantastic Patreon page. That page is a really useful tool for those miniature painters that want to bring their skills a step further. Full of painting guides and video tutorials, Ben’s Patreon has quickly become the reference point in online miniature painting teaching.\n\nBen will be in charge of painting Romain’s works and he will use some of them to demonstrate techniques in his usual tutorials and videos. As part of the deal, Ben patreons will have a exclusive 20% discount during the first month of sale of these miniatures.\n\nSo, if you are a fan of Romain’s sculpts and you want to have access to all the teachings and guide offered by Ben, plus a nice discount on the purchase of the models, sign up today on Ben’s Patreon and start enjoying this opportunity!\n\nAnd that is all for the moment. Next week we’ll have more stuff, in the shape of something historic, classic and cool 😉\n\nSee you soon!\n\nFeR\n\nNew cool collaboration for this month!\n\nHi all!\n\nWhile we give the final touches to some exciting new stuff for February’s releases (ETA, late next week), we want to give you a preview of a cool collaboration we have devised for one of our independent artists lines.\n\nWhat can be nicer than a line of fantastic busts sculpted by Romain Van Den Bogaert? Well, a line of fantastic busts sculpted by Romain Van Den Bogaert AND masterfully painted by Ben Komets!\n\nBoth artists are incredibly talented and we already have seen before the chemistry of their combined work on a miniature, and as they are also good friends, coming up with this idea was actually pretty evident.\n\nThe first project that will be part of this collaboration is this fantastic new sculpt, that will be released this month. Check a bit of a preview:\n\nAs most of you know, Ben Komets has his very own venture running in the shape of a fantastic Patreon page.

And what better way to start than painting some new and exciting project?\n\nIt was about time to add another mounted figure to the range, so check this amazing new release for Fahrenheit Miniature Project:\n\nFahrenheit Miniature Project\n\nFAH00016 – General “Stonewall” Jackson, 1863\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 14 plus photoetched parts\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nAnd also another addition to Jonatán Monerris’ line, a fantastic Knight Templar bust!\n\nPeter Punk Produktions\n\nPPK00016 – Knight Templar, Holy Land, 1120\n\nSculpture: Jonatán Monerris\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nWe are really happy with these two and we hope you like them too! Also, we have an announcement to make.\n\nBy the end of January, we will cease distributing Nutsplanet products through FeR Miniatures.\n\nBenny Sa and I have been discussing about this and we have realised that even if our agreement is profitable for both of us, the logistical difficulties that it brings have become more and more complicated. The shipments we send each other are significant and we legally import the merchandise, declaring its value and passing it through customs. That process delays the availability of the new releases and restock, as we sometimes have had shipments blocked at customs for as long as two months.\n\nWe haven’t found an alternative way to overcome this problem, so, keeping in mind that our priority is to avoid any delay of the products’ arrival to the customers, we have decided to return to a full distribution of the merchandise from our corresponding warehouses. We will have available the actual stock of Nutsplanet until the end of January. Beyond that, it will be removed from the web.\n\nHave a nice week!\n\nFeR Miniatures\n\nFeR Miniatures Christmas New Releases\n\nHi all!\n\nWe are ready and happy to announce the new releases for the Christmas season!\n\nFirst of all, good news! We make available to the general public the special pre-released figures we prepared for Scale Model Challenge 2017.\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00005 – Highland Clansman Veteran\n\nSculpture: Raúl García Latorre\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 12\n\nScale: 70 mm\n\nWomen, by Pepa Saavedra\n\nWOM00004 – Viviane\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Pepa Saavedra\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 4\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nAnd also we have two more brand new figures…\n\nFirst one is a new addition to Oriol Quin’s line of Medieval subjects:\n\nClash of Cultures – Deus Vult!\n\nCOC00009 – French Knight, Albigensian Crusade, 1209\n\nSculpture: Oriol Quin\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 12\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nAnd the second, another cool 54 mm fantasy figure by Jonatán Monerris!\n\nPeter Punk Produktions\n\nPPK00015 – Elora, the Gnome Heroine\n\nSculpture: Jonatán Monerris\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 2\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nAlso, we have an important announcement concerning one of our lines.\n\nAs you know, we carry many different lines of miniatures. Some of them are our own, some of them belong to collaborators of the company. Some of the lines get constant updates in the form of new releases, some others don’t get new releases so often. This last case can happen because of many reasons, projects that get more priority than others, artists who can devote more or less time at a certain moment to a certain line and many other underlying reasons. So, some of the lines can even get to a halt, if we don’t foresee how to continue them in the near future.\n\nThis is exactly the situation that we have with our Signature Series: Mike Blank. We have discussed the current state of affairs with Mike and even if everything is as friendly as usual, due to his work and family obligations he cannot cope with the responsibility of accepting more commissions from us in order to keep the line active.\n\nThe option we have found that better suits the interest of the artist, the company and the general public is to sell our existing range of Mike Blank figures to a third party, in this case, SK Miniatures. With that move, we solve the problem of continuity of the line (that by the way was impossible to continue by any other artist without changing completely its nature), our friend Steve Kirtley will add three nice miniatures to his already existing range of Mike Blank’s 70 mm figures, and the models are still on sale to the general public (it would have been a pity to discontinue them).\n\nHere is the link to SK Miniatures page, you will be able to find the figures there very shortly, as they will be the new exclusive distributors of them.\n\nThat’s all for the moment!\n\nHave a Merry Christmas\n\nFeR Miniatures\n\nFeR Miniatures October New Releases… and a couple of surprises for SMC!\n\nHi all!\n\nThis month is being really busy, thankfully we’ll have the chance to meet up with the friends and relax a bit this upcoming weekend at Scale Model Challenge! But, first of all, lets talk about the new releases 😉\n\nThe first one is a new XVII century work by Eduard Pérez.\n\nFahrenheit Miniature Project\n\nFAH00015 – “Le Cavalier”\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Jaume Ortiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 9 plus photoetched parts\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nA really nice kit that includes a novelty for the company, photoetched parts! This kind upgrade allows a very nice degree of detail on tiny parts like the spurs, sword lace and such, that would be almost impossible for a just resin (or metal) kit.\n\nWe also have the first two figures from the new collaboration line of Romain Van Den Bogaert!\n\nSignature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nROM00001 – The Old Count\n\nSculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nPainting: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 1\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nSignature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nROM00002 – Grok the Marauder\n\nSculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nPainting: Romain Van Den Bogaert\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 4\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nWe are really happy to finally show you these two. We will show you the painted version very soon (by Romain himself!), as he prefers to show them first unpainted to appreciate the detail of the bare sculpt.\n\nSo these are the releases for October but… wait, there’s more!\n\nAs this weekend we’ll go to SMC in The Netherlands, we wanted to do something special for our friends and customers going there. The first idea was like “OK, let’s give an overall discount just for the show” and, “Well, we also are the ones carrying the Nutsplanet sales table there, let’s extend that discount to their miniatures too”. So, the result is that you will have a 10% discount in ALL FeR Miniatures and Nutsplanet products during the weekend.\n\nEven if we know that discounts are appreciated, we thought “Mmm… Too easy. Needs to be more interesting”. So, we’ve made an extra effort and prepared a very limited stock of two future releases, 50 of each, to be sold in advance only at this weekend at SMC!\n\nThe first one is this fantastic new bust for Women by Pepa Saavedra, nothing more and nothing less than the haunting Lady of the Lake in person!\n\nWomen, by Pepa Saavedra\n\nWOM00004 – Viviane\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Pepa Saavedra\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 4\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nThe other is possibly, the most anticipated comeback in the history of the miniature hobby. This one needs no presentation…\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00005 – Highland Clansman Veteran\n\nSculpture: Raúl García Latorre\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 12\n\nScale: 70 mm\n\nSo. How does this works?\n\nWe’ll start selling these five new miniatures this weekend, at the SMC show in The Netherlands. The first 3 are the releases for October and also will be available from next Tuesday as usual (sorry, but if we want to guarantee a good customer service for them, we need to wait until our return before we start selling them). Viviane and the Clansman Veteran are a PRE-RELEASE edition, limited to 50 copies each just for the weekend. They won’t be available to the rest of the public until a future date yet to be determined, even if we return with any leftover stock. Let’s face it, we have to encourage attendance to shows, even if it means using some innocent blackmailing tactics, hehehe.\n\nSo, are you coming to SMC and you don’t want to risk missing them? We have opened a reservation list for picking up the kits there. Just send us an email to info@ferminiatures.com with your name, which figure you want (even both!) and how many you need (maybe you pick one for you and one for a friend). We will reserve you the kits so you just have to drop by and get them… of course, included in the discount offer!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All figures reserved and not yet claimed at Sunday afternoon (after lunch time) will be put on sale.\n\nLooking forward to see you all there\n\nFeR\n\nA new kid in town… Say hi to Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert!\n\nHi everybody!\n\nWe are cooking new exciting stuff around here (that will get announced next week) but, as we are really excited about it, we thought it would be cool to make some early announcement.\n\nDuring the last months, we have been discussing about a possible new collaboration and line of miniatures with one of our favourite artists. It is a real pleasure and a privilege to announce… (drumrolls)… the last addition to our team of independent artists… (wait for it!)… Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert!\n\nBesides being a very nice guy, Romain is also one of the best sculptors on the miniature’s industry. His incredibly personal style gives an instantly recognisable look to all his works that, somehow, manages to bring us to a place when fantasy becomes reality. Very few miniature sculptors manage to transmit the kind of realistic and, at the same time, particular feeling through their sculpts.\n\nSo, after talking about the possibility of a line of miniatures with him, we finally have things ready enough to start releasing his pieces. The first two will be released next week, along other new miniatures we are preparing for the upcoming SMC show in The Netherlands. For the moment, the only thing we’ll tell you is that you better prepare yourselves; there is really cool stuff around the corner 😉\n\nTalk soon!\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures September New Releases\n\nHi all!\n\nWe are happy to show you the new releases for this month.\n\nFirst, another re-edition of a classic Elite figure:\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00004 – Drummer Boy, 77th East Middlesex, 1808\n\nSculpture: Raúl García Latorre\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 6\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nAlso, a new character for our series devoted to literature:\n\nIcons of Literature\n\nLIT00003 – Rob Roy\n\nSculpture: Oriol Quin\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nAnd finally, a new cool 54mm figure from the talented Jonatán Monerris\n\nPeter Punk Produktions\n\nPPK00014 – Gallic Warrior, 52 B.

And remember that on Thursday, when we publish the releases, we’ll close the competition for winning the first three Elite figures. You only have to correctly guess which ones they are and participate here. Go and play!\n\nThe return of a legend… Say hi to ELITE classics!\n\nHi all!\n\nYes, you read it right. We are incredibly proud to announce that we have acquired the rights for reediting the Elite Miniaturas catalogue.\n\nElite Miniaturas was a miniatures company from Málaga, Spain that started its venture in the mid 90’s. From the beginning, their products featured such standard of quality that they took the whole hobby scene a huge step beyond in terms of what was possible to do with a miniature. They saw the first steps of a (then) young sculptor called Raúl García Latorre that, out of nowhere, got into the highest ranks of miniature stardom with legendary creations and innumerable awards. They released some of the most magnificent creations of sculptors like Stefano Cannone, Julian Hullis, Derek Hansen, Mike Blank, Young B. Song or Eduard Pérez. Sadly, sometimes good things come to an end and the company closed doors in late 2010. Since then, many of the pieces from their catalogue have become very sought after collector pieces, as the standard of quality they set is still better than many of the figures that get released to the market even today.\n\nFor me, there is a sentimental component about this company as, by pure chance, they were the people that introduced me to the world of historical figures. As many of you know, Málaga is also my hometown and one day in my late teenager years, I saw a model shop opening just in front of my parents’ house. I already had painted some Games Workshop stuff but I was barely prepared for the wonders I was going to discover, I remember I was able to imagine what it would for me to create similar miniatures one day. Sitting at a small table, at the end of the shop, was a guy of my same age. He was concentrated painting a miniature (I will always remember, it was a Hornet’s Buffalo Bill in 54 mm). I came nearer, say hi and said: “Oh, I also paint miniatures”. “May I have a look?”. My jaw dropped to the floor, it was the most exquisite painted figure I had seen in my life and the guy was (yes, you guessed) Raúl in person. Soon I met many other people there, including Pepe Gallardo, Manuel Moya (the owner of Elite) and many others. In many ways, it was the start of the road we walk today at FeR Miniatures.\n\nThis is a project in which we have been working for some time, first striking a deal with Manuel, then planning and preparing the figures not only for the enjoyment of the historical old-timers, but also for a new generation of miniature painters and collectors. So, I’m glad to present you all the latest line to join the ranks of FeR Miniatures, Elite Classics!\n\nThe plan is as follows. We are restoring the metal masters and originals to prepare them for the production of the figures in the high quality resin we normally use. We shop for styrene resin at Merritt Supply website. Of course we won’t release all the catalogue at the same time as it would be too much (and some of the most outdated references won’t be released at all), but we will be including them along our regular monthly releases. Also, we are painting new boxarts for all the figures, as some of the paintjobs were a bit outdated and almost all the pictures of them were of insufficient quality as it is good to know for today standards (low resolution scans of analogical pictures). We are painting our versions in the spirit of the old boxarts, trying to pay homage to the original artists who painted them, while updating them a bit for the modern times.\n\nThe first three miniatures of this line will be released on the 10th of August, on time for the Miniatures’ Day and, as it is still a secret which ones will be the “early bird” ones, we have had an idea around that for a little game on Facebook where you will have a chance of guessing which ones will be and win them for free! We’ll post the details of the promotion on our Facebook page in a while 😉\n\nWe are really, REALLY happy and excited about this… Al those awesome figures will be again available and… in resin! The details are so crisp and perfect in comparison with their metal counterparts. We look forward for your opinion 😀\n\nAh, I almost forgot, the countdown is still running!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR"
