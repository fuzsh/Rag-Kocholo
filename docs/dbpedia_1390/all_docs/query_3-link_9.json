        "text": "Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is experiencing a lack of interoperability across the multiple competing platforms that are available. Consequently, service providers can only access vertical data silos that imply high costs and jeopardize their solutions market potential. It is necessary to transform the current situation with competing non-interoperable IoT platforms into a common ecosystem enabling the emergence of cross-platform, cross-standard, and cross-domain IoT services and applications. This paper presents a platform that has been implemented for realizing this vision. It leverages semantic web technologies to address the two key challenges in expanding the IoT beyond product silos into web-scale open ecosystems: data interoperability and resources identification and discovery. The paper provides extensive description of the proposed solution and its implementation details. Regarding the implementation details, it is important to highlight that the platfor...\n\n—A Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) brings together the Semantic Web and the Web of Things (WoT), associating semantically annotated information to web-enabled physical devices , services and their data, towards seamless data integration and better understanding of real-world information. A missing element in order to realize SWoT is a standardized, scalable and flexible way to globally discover in (near) real time web-connected embedded devices, as well as their semantic data. To address this gap, we propose WOT Semantic Search Engine (WOTS2E), which is a search engine for the SWoT, based on web crawling, being able to discover Linked Data endpoints and, through them, WoT-enabled devices and their services. In this paper, we describe the design, development and implementation of WOTS2E, as well as an evaluation procedure showing its operation and performance across the web.\n\nThe World Wide Web has emerged as the middleware of choice for most distributed systems. Recent standardization efforts for the Web of Things and Linked Data are now turning hypermedia into a homogeneous information fabric that interconnects everything – devices, information resources, abstract concepts, etc. The latest standards allow clients not only to browse and query, but also to observe and act on this hypermedia fabric. Researchers and practitioners are already looking for means to build more sophisticated clients able to meet their design objectives through flexible autonomous use of this hypermedia fabric. Such autonomous agents have been studied to large extent in research on distributed artificial intelligence and, in particular, multi-agent systems. These recent developments thus motivate the need for a broader perspective that can only be achieved through a concerted effort of the research communities on the Web Architecture and the Web of Things, Semantic Web and Linke...\n\nThe integration of systems of autonomous agents in Web of Things (WoT) environments is a promising approach to provide and distribute intelligence in world-wide pervasive systems. A central problem then is to enable autonomous agents to discover heterogeneous resources in large-scale, dynamic WoT environments. This is true in particular if an environment relies on open-standards and evolves rapidly requiring agents to adapt their behavior to achieve their goals. To this end, we developed a search engine for the WoT that allows autonomous agents to perform approximate search queries in order to find relevant resources in their environment in (weak) real time. The search engine crawls dynamic WoT environments to discover and index device metadata described with the W3C WoT Thing Description, and exposes a SPARQL endpoint that agents can use for approximate search. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented a prototype application for the maintenance of industrial r...\n\nNowadays, cultural spaces (e.g., museums and archaeological sites) are interested in adding intelligence in their ecosystem by deploying different types of smart applications such as automated environmental monitoring, energy saving, and user experience optimization. Such an ecosystem is better realized through semantics in order to efficiently represent the required knowledge for facilitating interoperability among different application domains, integration of data, and inference of new knowledge as insights into what may have not been observed at first sight. This paper reports on our recent efforts for the engineering of a smart museum (SM) ontology that meets the following objectives: (a) represent knowledge related to trustworthy IoT entities that “live” and are deployed in a SM, i.e., things, sensors, actuators, people, data, and applications; (b) deal with the semantic interoperability and integration of heterogeneous SM applications and data; (c) represent knowledge related ...\n\nThis thesis is concerned with the development of efficient methods for managing contextualised time-series data and event streams produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) so that both historical and real-time information can be utilised to generate value within analytical applications. From a database systems perspective, two conflicting challenges motivate this research, interoperability and performance. IoT applications integrating streams of time-series data from heterogeneous IoT agents require a level of semantic interoperability. This semantic interoperability can be achieved with a common flexible data model that represents both metadata and data. However, applications might also have time constraints or require processing to be performed on large volumes of historical and streaming time-series data, possibly on resource-constrained platforms, without significant delay. Obtaining good performance is complicated by the complexity of the data model. In the first part of the the..."
