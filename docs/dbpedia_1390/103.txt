FeR Miniatures New Releases and… Miniatures Day!!!

Hi all!

Damm, it is hot out there, isn’t it!? It doesn’t matter to us, as you know nothing can persuade us not to release new cool stuff all the time!

For August, in order to make you all work as little as possible, we have grouped all new releases in a single day. And, as we care for you (yes, you who are reading this, don’t look over your shoulder!), we are releasing August’s new stuff the day before the Miniatures’ Day so you have a shot at buying with a pretty discount for a start!

Actually here, in your favourite miniatures company, we have been working on some extra cool stuff to provide you with something cool and appropriate for the season.

We have been thinking on adding another pirate to the line for some time, but it had to be something magnificent, as the previous pirate with monkey by Pedro Fernández became an instant classic so the bar was set really high. During these days, we have shown you some hints:

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (May 30th)

Well, well, well…

This week, not only we bring a new figure, but also we bring a new line! We had a lot of projects in mind that we thought that would display nicely on a bigger scale, allowing for even more intricate detail. With that idea we decided to set a sister Magna Historica line, but in 1/10!

The first bust of this line is frankly spectacular, even including photoetched parts for the rapier sword’s guard:

Magna Historica 1/10

MHS00001 – De Nederlandse Edelman, 1624

Sculpture: Eduard Pérez

Painting: Marc Masclans

Number of parts of the kit: 11 plus photoetched parts

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (May 15th)

Hi all!

Due to diverse reasons, some related to the company and some other being of personal nature, many pending new releases had been delayed for a few weeks. We are happy to inform you all that we are resuming our usual rate of operation, and nothing better to celebrate it than showing you a pair of new cool figures! Let’s check them 😉

First one is a new sculpture of Jonatán Monerris, the first 75 mm figure for his Peter Punk Produktions series. We took the chance and paid some homage with it to a good friend from the hobby…

Peter Punk Produktions

PPK00017 – Sergio Durán, Spanish Buccaneer, 1671

Sculpture: Jonatán Monerris

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

The Might of Rome or… These Romans are crazy!

Hi all

As you might have seen during these days if you follow us in our social media, we have gone completely bananas about Imperial Rome!

This is a project that has been carefully crafted for some time with the incredibly talented sculptor Ramón Martínez and the wild child of the brushes and local genius Marc Masclans, a true vignette of 3 busts of the same theme that can work together or individually. As you know, we always try to release miniatures with a twist, so we decided to set this command group of Imperial Roman soldiers in the days of the Iceni revolt in Britannia, led by the infamous Boudicca (wait a minute… I wonder in which side we are).

We have received an incredible response from the audience and many questions about the release date, format, etc…

The busts are the usual 1/12 scale busts we do on the Magna Historica line. They are an Optio, a Centurion and a Signifer from the Legio XX Valeria Victrix.

Tomorrow, we will make them available at our website, and you will be able to purchase them individually or as a limited edition boxed set of the three busts, only available in our online store at a special price:

The Might of Rome boxed set is aimed to those collectors who might want to get all the busts. For that reason, and as a courtesy to our beloved customers, its price will be around 20% lower than the global price of getting the busts individually. The set is strictly limited to 60 copies (you better keep your eyes open!) and will include:

– The three busts.

– A exclusive resin plaque with the latin inscription “Ad Astra per Aspera” (through the adversity to the stars) to be used on a bigger vignette base for the project.

– A signed and numbered limited edition certificate.

Tomorrow we will reveal the final boxart pics in color and the busts will be released around 19h Central European Time, so set your alarms and do not miss this chance to get them 😉

Soon more news!

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (March 21th) and some more…

Hi all!

It’s being a busy week! We have a new figure to release but we are also in the middle of some big project that will be out next week. OK, let’s get focused, hehehe. First of all the new release of this week, another classic from Elite Miniaturas that comes back in an all-new revised edition in resin:

Elite Classics

ELI00007 – Lansquenet, 1525

Sculpture: Mike Blank

Painting: Fernando Ruiz

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 6

Scale: 54 mm

Besides this, we have started showing some sneak pics of a project we have been working on for some time:

Just from the pics it is very difficult to tell what the subject might be, so it is somewhat a mysterious thing in which you’ll still need to do a lot of guessing (just joking). Check our Facebook or Instagram to learn more about it during these days. In any case, the busts will be available on our website next week.

We’ll update you on this very soon!

Cheers

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (March 9th)

Sculpture: Matthieu Rouèche

More stuff coming soon!

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (Feb 23th)

Hi all!

As we were saying last week, we have moved to a new format in what it comes to new releases. Due to the increasing number of miniatures we have planned to add to our catalogue, from now onward we are releasing them in a weekly basis instead of monthly. So, as promised, here is another release…

This time, we have another classic miniature from the legendary Elite Miniaturas and it seems we are starting re-releasing the long unavailable Franco-Prussian War collection!

Elite Classics

ELI00006 – Lieutenant, 1st Zouave Regt

Sculpture: Stefano Cannone

Painting: Fernando Ruiz

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 8

Scale: 75 mm

There will be another release next week, so stay tuned!

Besides this, I would like to send a reminder about my upcoming seminars in Atlanta. Seats are beginning to run low on both! Let’s remind the details:

So if you are thinking on joining but you are still unsure, send an email to fer2018paint@gmail.com and you’ll get all details.

Talk soon!

FeR Miniatures Latest New Releases (Feb 16th)

Hi all!

Yes, you guessed it, we have new releases! But before showing them to you, we would like to explain a small change of format we are going to try in the way we release new stuff. As you know, we use to make a several-miniatures release every month; that means we need to have everything ready for a certain moment (or as we call it, “the warp opening window of opportunity”). Let’s be really honest about it: it is a bit of stress for everyone involved as sometimes is really difficult to make all things concerning production, painting, design, etc. match at the same time. Add to that the increasing number of new releases we are having (and that we have planned for the year) and you get a situation in which that decisive monthly action involves every time more work and resources.

So, keeping in mind that we are a small company and our work resources are not unlimited, we have decided to release our new miniatures in a WEEKLY BASIS. It means that we’ll have the same amount of new miniatures, but instead of releasing, let’s say 5, in a particular day of the month, we are going to release them during the whole month. That way we’ll have all the time to concentrate on every single release and showcase it as it deserves, we will avoid delaying the whole release lot just because something is not ready and everything would be easier from a logistics point of view. Maybe one week we won’t release anything or maybe we release 2 figures, depending of the volume of things ready at that point, we’ll see.

In any case, just wanted to keep you all updated, as you know that communications with the customers are very important for us. Let’s check those new minis!

First one is a nice Confederate Officer for Fahrenheit Miniature Project:

Fahrenheit Miniature Project

FAH00017 – Confederate Artillery Officer, Gettysburg, 1863

Sculpture: Eduard Pérez

Painting: Fernando Ruiz

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 8

Scale: 75 mm

The second release is something we already have shown some previews about, but that now is fully available. This project is the first one of a collaboration between Romain Van Den Bogaert and Ben Komets:

Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert

ROM00003 – Agvaldr Long-nose

Sculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert

Painting: Ben Komets

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 32 (torso and head plus LOTS of fungus and mushrooms)

Scale: 1/10

As most of you know, Ben Komets has his very own venture running in the shape of a fantastic Patreon page. That page is a really useful tool for those miniature painters that want to bring their skills a step further. Full of painting guides and video tutorials, Ben’s Patreon has quickly become the reference point in online miniature painting teaching.

Ben will be in charge of painting Romain’s works and he will use some of them to demonstrate techniques in his usual tutorials and videos. As part of the deal, Ben patreons will have a exclusive 20% discount during the first month of sale of these miniatures.

So, if you are a fan of Romain’s sculpts and you want to have access to all the teachings and guide offered by Ben, plus a nice discount on the purchase of the models, sign up today on Ben’s Patreon and start enjoying this opportunity!

And that is all for the moment. Next week we’ll have more stuff, in the shape of something historic, classic and cool 😉

See you soon!

New cool collaboration for this month!

Hi all!

While we give the final touches to some exciting new stuff for February’s releases (ETA, late next week), we want to give you a preview of a cool collaboration we have devised for one of our independent artists lines.

What can be nicer than a line of fantastic busts sculpted by Romain Van Den Bogaert? Well, a line of fantastic busts sculpted by Romain Van Den Bogaert AND masterfully painted by Ben Komets!

Both artists are incredibly talented and we already have seen before the chemistry of their combined work on a miniature, and as they are also good friends, coming up with this idea was actually pretty evident.

The first project that will be part of this collaboration is this fantastic new sculpt, that will be released this month. Check a bit of a preview:

FeR Miniatures January New Releases

Hi all!

We hope that the New Year has started good for all of you! And what better way to start than painting some new and exciting project?

It was about time to add another mounted figure to the range, so check this amazing new release for Fahrenheit Miniature Project:

Fahrenheit Miniature Project

FAH00016 – General “Stonewall” Jackson, 1863

Sculpture: Eduard Pérez

Painting: Fernando Ruiz

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 14 plus photoetched parts

Scale: 75 mm

And also another addition to Jonatán Monerris’ line, a fantastic Knight Templar bust!

Peter Punk Produktions

PPK00016 – Knight Templar, Holy Land, 1120

Sculpture: Jonatán Monerris

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 8

Scale: 1/12

We are really happy with these two and we hope you like them too! Also, we have an announcement to make.

By the end of January, we will cease distributing Nutsplanet products through FeR Miniatures.

Benny Sa and I have been discussing about this and we have realised that even if our agreement is profitable for both of us, the logistical difficulties that it brings have become more and more complicated. The shipments we send each other are significant and we legally import the merchandise, declaring its value and passing it through customs. That process delays the availability of the new releases and restock, as we sometimes have had shipments blocked at customs for as long as two months.

We haven’t found an alternative way to overcome this problem, so, keeping in mind that our priority is to avoid any delay of the products’ arrival to the customers, we have decided to return to a full distribution of the merchandise from our corresponding warehouses. We will have available the actual stock of Nutsplanet until the end of January. Beyond that, it will be removed from the web.

Have a nice week!

FeR Miniatures Christmas New Releases

Hi all!

We are ready and happy to announce the new releases for the Christmas season!

First of all, good news! We make available to the general public the special pre-released figures we prepared for Scale Model Challenge 2017.

Elite Classics

ELI00005 – Highland Clansman Veteran

Sculpture: Raúl García Latorre

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 12

Scale: 70 mm

Women, by Pepa Saavedra

WOM00004 – Viviane

Sculpture: Ramón Martínez

Painting: Pepa Saavedra

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 4

Scale: 1/10

And also we have two more brand new figures…

First one is a new addition to Oriol Quin’s line of Medieval subjects:

Clash of Cultures – Deus Vult!

COC00009 – French Knight, Albigensian Crusade, 1209

Sculpture: Oriol Quin

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 12

Scale: 75 mm

And the second, another cool 54 mm fantasy figure by Jonatán Monerris!

Peter Punk Produktions

PPK00015 – Elora, the Gnome Heroine

Sculpture: Jonatán Monerris

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 2

Scale: 54 mm

Also, we have an important announcement concerning one of our lines.

As you know, we carry many different lines of miniatures. Some of them are our own, some of them belong to collaborators of the company. Some of the lines get constant updates in the form of new releases, some others don’t get new releases so often. This last case can happen because of many reasons, projects that get more priority than others, artists who can devote more or less time at a certain moment to a certain line and many other underlying reasons. So, some of the lines can even get to a halt, if we don’t foresee how to continue them in the near future.

This is exactly the situation that we have with our Signature Series: Mike Blank. We have discussed the current state of affairs with Mike and even if everything is as friendly as usual, due to his work and family obligations he cannot cope with the responsibility of accepting more commissions from us in order to keep the line active.

The option we have found that better suits the interest of the artist, the company and the general public is to sell our existing range of Mike Blank figures to a third party, in this case, SK Miniatures. With that move, we solve the problem of continuity of the line (that by the way was impossible to continue by any other artist without changing completely its nature), our friend Steve Kirtley will add three nice miniatures to his already existing range of Mike Blank’s 70 mm figures, and the models are still on sale to the general public (it would have been a pity to discontinue them).

Here is the link to SK Miniatures page, you will be able to find the figures there very shortly, as they will be the new exclusive distributors of them.

That’s all for the moment!

Have a Merry Christmas

FeR Miniatures October New Releases… and a couple of surprises for SMC!

Hi all!

This month is being really busy, thankfully we’ll have the chance to meet up with the friends and relax a bit this upcoming weekend at Scale Model Challenge! But, first of all, lets talk about the new releases 😉

The first one is a new XVII century work by Eduard Pérez.

Fahrenheit Miniature Project

FAH00015 – “Le Cavalier”

Sculpture: Eduard Pérez

Painting: Jaume Ortiz

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 9 plus photoetched parts

Scale: 75 mm

A really nice kit that includes a novelty for the company, photoetched parts! This kind upgrade allows a very nice degree of detail on tiny parts like the spurs, sword lace and such, that would be almost impossible for a just resin (or metal) kit.

We also have the first two figures from the new collaboration line of Romain Van Den Bogaert!

Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert

ROM00001 – The Old Count

Sculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert

Painting: Romain Van Den Bogaert

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 1

Scale: 1/10

Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert

ROM00002 – Grok the Marauder

Sculpture: Romain Van Den Bogaert

Painting: Romain Van Den Bogaert

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 4

Scale: 1/10

We are really happy to finally show you these two. We will show you the painted version very soon (by Romain himself!), as he prefers to show them first unpainted to appreciate the detail of the bare sculpt.

So these are the releases for October but… wait, there’s more!

As this weekend we’ll go to SMC in The Netherlands, we wanted to do something special for our friends and customers going there. The first idea was like “OK, let’s give an overall discount just for the show” and, “Well, we also are the ones carrying the Nutsplanet sales table there, let’s extend that discount to their miniatures too”. So, the result is that you will have a 10% discount in ALL FeR Miniatures and Nutsplanet products during the weekend.

Even if we know that discounts are appreciated, we thought “Mmm… Too easy. Needs to be more interesting”. So, we’ve made an extra effort and prepared a very limited stock of two future releases, 50 of each, to be sold in advance only at this weekend at SMC!

The first one is this fantastic new bust for Women by Pepa Saavedra, nothing more and nothing less than the haunting Lady of the Lake in person!

Women, by Pepa Saavedra

WOM00004 – Viviane

Sculpture: Ramón Martínez

Painting: Pepa Saavedra

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 4

Scale: 1/10

The other is possibly, the most anticipated comeback in the history of the miniature hobby. This one needs no presentation…

Elite Classics

ELI00005 – Highland Clansman Veteran

Sculpture: Raúl García Latorre

Painting: Marc Masclans

Material: Resin

Number of parts of the kit: 12

Scale: 70 mm

So. How does this works?

We’ll start selling these five new miniatures this weekend, at the SMC show in The Netherlands. The first 3 are the releases for October and also will be available from next Tuesday as usual (sorry, but if we want to guarantee a good customer service for them, we need to wait until our return before we start selling them). Viviane and the Clansman Veteran are a PRE-RELEASE edition, limited to 50 copies each just for the weekend. They won’t be available to the rest of the public until a future date yet to be determined, even if we return with any leftover stock. Let’s face it, we have to encourage attendance to shows, even if it means using some innocent blackmailing tactics, hehehe.

So, are you coming to SMC and you don’t want to risk missing them? We have opened a reservation list for picking up the kits there. Just send us an email to info@ferminiatures.com with your name, which figure you want (even both!) and how many you need (maybe you pick one for you and one for a friend). We will reserve you the kits so you just have to drop by and get them… of course, included in the discount offer!

IMPORTANT NOTE: All figures reserved and not yet claimed at Sunday afternoon (after lunch time) will be put on sale.

Looking forward to see you all there

A new kid in town… Say hi to Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert!

Hi everybody!

We are cooking new exciting stuff around here (that will get announced next week) but, as we are really excited about it, we thought it would be cool to make some early announcement.

During the last months, we have been discussing about a possible new collaboration and line of miniatures with one of our favourite artists. It is a real pleasure and a privilege to announce… (drumrolls)… the last addition to our team of independent artists… (wait for it!)… Signature Series: Romain Van Den Bogaert!

Besides being a very nice guy, Romain is also one of the best sculptors on the miniature’s industry. His incredibly personal style gives an instantly recognisable look to all his works that, somehow, manages to bring us to a place when fantasy becomes reality. Very few miniature sculptors manage to transmit the kind of realistic and, at the same time, particular feeling through their sculpts.

So, after talking about the possibility of a line of miniatures with him, we finally have things ready enough to start releasing his pieces. The first two will be released next week, along other new miniatures we are preparing for the upcoming SMC show in The Netherlands. For the moment, the only thing we’ll tell you is that you better prepare yourselves; there is really cool stuff around the corner 😉

Talk soon!

P.S. And remember that on Thursday, when we publish the releases, we’ll close the competition for winning the first three Elite figures. You only have to correctly guess which ones they are and participate here. Go and play!

The return of a legend… Say hi to ELITE classics!

Hi all!

Yes, you read it right. We are incredibly proud to announce that we have acquired the rights for reediting the Elite Miniaturas catalogue.

Elite Miniaturas was a miniatures company from Málaga, Spain that started its venture in the mid 90’s. From the beginning, their products featured such standard of quality that they took the whole hobby scene a huge step beyond in terms of what was possible to do with a miniature. They saw the first steps of a (then) young sculptor called Raúl García Latorre that, out of nowhere, got into the highest ranks of miniature stardom with legendary creations and innumerable awards. They released some of the most magnificent creations of sculptors like Stefano Cannone, Julian Hullis, Derek Hansen, Mike Blank, Young B. Song or Eduard Pérez. Sadly, sometimes good things come to an end and the company closed doors in late 2010. Since then, many of the pieces from their catalogue have become very sought after collector pieces, as the standard of quality they set is still better than many of the figures that get released to the market even today.

For me, there is a sentimental component about this company as, by pure chance, they were the people that introduced me to the world of historical figures. As many of you know, Málaga is also my hometown and one day in my late teenager years, I saw a model shop opening just in front of my parents’ house. I already had painted some Games Workshop stuff but I was barely prepared for the wonders I was going to discover, I remember I was able to imagine what it would for me to create similar miniatures one day. Sitting at a small table, at the end of the shop, was a guy of my same age. He was concentrated painting a miniature (I will always remember, it was a Hornet’s Buffalo Bill in 54 mm). I came nearer, say hi and said: “Oh, I also paint miniatures”. “May I have a look?”. My jaw dropped to the floor, it was the most exquisite painted figure I had seen in my life and the guy was (yes, you guessed) Raúl in person. Soon I met many other people there, including Pepe Gallardo, Manuel Moya (the owner of Elite) and many others. In many ways, it was the start of the road we walk today at FeR Miniatures.

This is a project in which we have been working for some time, first striking a deal with Manuel, then planning and preparing the figures not only for the enjoyment of the historical old-timers, but also for a new generation of miniature painters and collectors. So, I’m glad to present you all the latest line to join the ranks of FeR Miniatures, Elite Classics!

The plan is as follows. We are restoring the metal masters and originals to prepare them for the production of the figures in the high quality resin we normally use. We shop for styrene resin at Merritt Supply website. Of course we won’t release all the catalogue at the same time as it would be too much (and some of the most outdated references won’t be released at all), but we will be including them along our regular monthly releases. Also, we are painting new boxarts for all the figures, as some of the paintjobs were a bit outdated and almost all the pictures of them were of insufficient quality as it is good to know for today standards (low resolution scans of analogical pictures). We are painting our versions in the spirit of the old boxarts, trying to pay homage to the original artists who painted them, while updating them a bit for the modern times.

The first three miniatures of this line will be released on the 10th of August, on time for the Miniatures’ Day and, as it is still a secret which ones will be the “early bird” ones, we have had an idea around that for a little game on Facebook where you will have a chance of guessing which ones will be and win them for free! We’ll post the details of the promotion on our Facebook page in a while 😉

We are really, REALLY happy and excited about this… Al those awesome figures will be again available and… in resin! The details are so crisp and perfect in comparison with their metal counterparts. We look forward for your opinion 😀

Ah, I almost forgot, the countdown is still running!

Cheers
