        "text": "Citation preview\n\nBetween God and Hitler\n\nDuring World War II, approximately 1,000 Christian chaplains accompanied Wehrmacht forces wherever they went, from Poland to France, Greece, North Africa, and the Soviet Union. Chaplains were witnesses to atrocity and by their presence helped normalize extreme violence and legitimate its perpetrators. Military chaplains played a key role in propagating a narrative of righteousness that erased Germany’s victims and transformed the aggressors into noble ﬁgures who suffered but triumphed over their foes. Between God and Hitler is the ﬁrst book to examine Protestant and Catholic military chaplains in Germany from Hitler’s rise to power, to defeat, collapse, and Allied occupation. Drawing on a wide array of sources – chaplains’ letters and memoirs, military reports, Jewish testimonies, photographs, and popular culture – this book offers insight into how Christian clergy served the cause of genocide, sometimes eagerly, sometimes reluctantly, even unknowingly, but always loyally. doris l. bergen is the Chancellor Rose and Ray Wolfe Professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Toronto.

Initially, I thought it would be easy. I ﬁrst encountered the Wehrmacht chaplains in the late 1980s, when I was working on my dissertation on the German Christian Movement, a pro-Nazi Protestant group. In a church archive, I came across a letter from a Lutheran pastor who begged Reich Bishop Ludwig Müller to get him a job in the military chaplaincy. It was the ﬁrst I had heard of Christian chaplains in the army of National Socialist Germany, and some checking revealed that there was almost no scholarship on the subject, beyond a pair of articles published twenty years earlier by a German military historian.1 Here was a gap I could ﬁll. In 1990, a friend who was completing a dissertation on the Volkssturm – Nazi Germany’s last-ditch effort to mobilize its civilian ﬁghting power against the advancing Allies – asked me to join a panel at the annual meeting of the American Military Institute.2 The location that year was Duke University, convenient for us as graduate students at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and I agreed. Some intensive research at the German Military Archive in Freiburg turned up a wealth of sources, and I gave a paper titled “‘Germany Is Our Mission, Christ Is Our Strength!’ The Wehrmacht Chaplaincy and the ‘German Christian’ Movement.”3 The audience responded positively, and a publisher suggested the subject would make a good book. Excited, I quickly came up with a plan to address this neglected topic. I would write a short, straightforward history built around three questions: Who were the Wehrmacht chaplains? What did they do? What was their relationship to Nazi crimes? I expected to be done within a year, two at the most. Of course it was the third question, about Nazi crimes and speciﬁcally the crimes of the Wehrmacht, that sparked the most interest, including from me. In the meantime, I had a new position at the University of Vermont, where my responsibilities included teaching undergraduate and master’s classes on the Holocaust. Thinking harder about the Nazi German murder of Jews complicated my approach to the Wehrmacht chaplains. So did a crucial piece of advice from Gerhard Weinberg: “Do not separate the Holocaust and the war.”4 ix\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nInstead of a simple narrative, I began to see my task as analyzing the failure of Christianity in the midst of massive violence. Where were the chaplains at Iaşi and Kamianets-Podilskyi, at Ponary, Babyn Yar, Lidice, Oradour-sur-Glane, and hundreds of other sites of mass murder? Early in my archival research I discovered the incident I describe in the Introduction, about German chaplains and the killing of Jewish children at Bila Tserkva (Belaya Tserkov) in the summer of 1941.5 Subsequently I learned I was not the ﬁrst to have noticed it: Ernst Klee, Willi Dressen, and Volker Riess had included some of the key documents in a remarkable collection, published in English as “The Good Old Days”: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders.6 And there were other glimpses of chaplains in the midst of atrocities. An article on the Wehrmacht in Greece quoted a Protestant chaplain who described the “heavy burden” that killing civilians and burning down their villages placed on the men of his unit.7 A collection of reminiscences from the war years by Catholic priests and seminarians included a few poignant, if brief, allusions to witnessing murder of Jews in Germanoccupied territory.8 Now I decided my story was a moral tale, about the chaplains’ failure, their weakness, and their efforts to uphold Christianity that ended up serving the cause of genocide. This version of my book would be centered in 1941 on Germany’s eastern front, and it would basically expand on a presentation I gave at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1997, at a conference on Religion and Genocide organized by Omer Bartov and Phyllis Mack and subsequently published in the volume In God’s Name.9 The revised project was more demanding emotionally, but I still expected it would be straightforward to write. I had gathered a lot of material and knew what I wanted to say: the Wehrmacht chaplains were witnesses to the murder of Jews, they were complicit in the Holocaust, and their history was a warning to Christians and people of faith everywhere about the high cost of partnership with a brutal state – perhaps with any state. But somehow the idea felt ﬂat. For one thing, much of the material I had found seemed oddly bland. Although chaplains operated in the thick of war and genocide, the records they produced rarely acknowledged German violence or its victims, and when they did so, it was brieﬂy and obliquely, as if they were viewing events from a vast distance. Was I stretching the evidence? Would anyone be convinced? Or would I need to spend years chasing down every lead in search of a smoking gun, preferably in the hands of a Wehrmacht chaplain? Another problem involved tone. Although I was convinced chaplains had come down on the side of the perpetrators and it distressed me when readers interpreted my analytical approach as sympathetic, it seemed shallow and sanctimonious to hammer away at the German chaplains, page after page.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nWas I even saying anything new? So many social and professional groups had been studied and found to have been eager partners in the Nazi system: the middle class, “Aryan” women, physicians, lawyers, teachers, pastors, nurses, university professors, and more. Why would anyone expect anything different from military chaplains? Meanwhile, other projects and commitments demanded my attention, and I put the chaplains aside. When I left the University of Notre Dame for Toronto, a friend predicted that I would never ﬁnish the book. Once you are no longer inside a Christian institution, he intimated, military chaplains will seem irrelevant. It took the events of September 11, 2001, the multivalent aftermath, and another invitation to jolt me to return to the chaplains and to recognize the importance of chronology. That insight changed my book again. In 2010, a colleague at the University of Toronto asked me to co-organize a workshop on the last year of World War II.10 Thinking it would be a good opportunity to revisit the Wehrmacht chaplains, I agreed. As I dug through boxes, ﬁles, and half-written chapters, seeking material on the period from early 1944 to May 1945, I was struck by how much the chaplains’ situation changed over the course of the war. Thinking chronologically also made it clear that I had been so ﬁxated on the chaplains as ﬂawed individuals I had failed to notice the power of chaplaincy as an institution. Suddenly the chaplains’ defensive posture, the collective eager-to-please dynamic I call “compensatory compliance,” their “subtle duel” with Nazi authorities,11 and the reciprocal processes of legitimation snapped into focus. No doubt my own experience, by this time of many years, working in institutions, from the provincial government of Alberta to a series of universities, most inﬂuentially the University of Notre Dame, played a role too. I came to appreciate the ways that institutions, ofﬁces, and systems shape, limit, and sometimes enable and magnify individual efforts. Now I had a structure for my study of the Wehrmacht chaplains, and I knew the book needed to extend chronologically in both directions from 1941. This revamped approach was going to be difﬁcult practically – there were holes in my research that I would need to address, particularly for the prewar and early war years – and in the meantime, exciting new scholarship by others – notably Martin Röw, Dagmar Pöpping, Lauren Faulkner Rossi, and David Harrisville – meant there was now a historiography to engage.12 But the book seemed possible and also potentially important to counter a tendency in the historical scholarship, and in North American society as a whole, to reduce Nazism to the work of bad or weak individuals. I returned to the manuscript even though I never felt like I had enough time. As a professor at a large research university, I always seemed to be reading other people’s work: student papers, dissertations, article and book manuscripts, fellowship applications, and so on. Increasingly I was dissatisﬁed by\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nmethodologies that left people out of historical analyses and reproduced silences in the archives.13 But for a long time I failed to notice that my work on the military chaplains did the same thing. Feminist and postcolonial approaches, scholarship on enslaved people, and Indigenous histories helped prompt my rethinking,14 and although I had put it to the back of my mind, I slowly came to understand the advice I had received years earlier from a friend, the medievalist Kathleen Biddick,15 when she read my draft of an article on the military chaplains: try not to replicate the perpetrators’ gaze, she had told me. For a few years I had been urging PhD students and anyone else who would listen to look for counter-voices and let some actual people interrupt the smooth surface of your analysis. These admonitions applied to me, too. Teaching a class on the Holocaust in Literature with Anna Shternshis deepened this insight.16 The practice of integrated history, so powerfully implemented in works by Dalia Ofer, Saul Friedländer, Marion Kaplan, Alexandra Garbarini, Laura Jockusch, Zoë Waxman, and others,17 also turns out to have been the original methodology of study of the Holocaust, as evidenced in the 1940s by Emanuel Ringelblum, Cecilia Slepak, Rachel Auerbach, Philip Friedman, the Black Book project of Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman, David Boder, and many other contemporaries.18 Commitment to an integrated history generated new challenges. For one thing, the amount of potentially relevant material was boundless, yet chaplains themselves were elusive. How could I know where to even begin looking for glimpses of them in the tens of thousands of interviews of Jewish survivors in the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive alone? Hiring research assistants from our University of Toronto undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom know languages other than English, has made it possible to carry out a number of targeted searches.19 You will read some of the results in the pages that follow. The Jews, Poles, French, Ukrainians, Russians, Italians, and others whose words, voices, and experiences are recorded in personal accounts and various collections of survivor testimonies do not necessarily talk about military chaplains – in fact, only a minuscule number of them do so explicitly – but they make it possible to see chaplains and the issues they embody from the outside. Working on this book in the summer of 2020 – as protests insisting that Black Lives Matter swept through the United States, Canada, and the world, and as the president of the United States had peaceful demonstrators driven away with tear gas and pepper balls so he could pose in front of a church, brandishing a Bible – added a particular urgency to the need to open up Holocaust Studies, acknowledge racism, and recognize its targets and victims. The urgency of seeing from the outside hit me with the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent reckoning with systemic anti-Black racism, and in\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nCanada with systemic anti-Indigenous racism. I came to see the Wehrmacht chaplains as important not only as members of an institution but as people embedded in systems and structures that fed on destruction even while they denied it and erased its victims – in other words, as part of what I call “genocidal culture.” Switching the perspective and approaching the Wehrmacht chaplains in multiple ways reframes and illuminates familiar questions: What is the place of religion in war and conﬂict? How do structures and systems shape people’s behavior and with what repercussions? What narratives frame possibilities for ﬁnding meaning in violent encounters in the past, present, and future? What and whom do dominant narratives silence? This book is as far as I got. So much more could be done to realize the potential of integrated history. And there is another layer of integration I have only begun to explore. It involves examining the Wehrmacht chaplains in connection with religion and violence in other settings. Consider the roles of clergy, including chaplains, in the genocides in Rwanda, Guatemala, and Indonesia in the 1990s, 1980s, and 1960s, or the Buddhist chaplains in the Japanese military in World War II, or Christians who preached murder and justiﬁed the destruction of Indigenous peoples in North America over the course of centuries.20 I am not saying all situations of violence are the same, because of course they are not, and each is distinct. So is the Holocaust and the particular role of Christian chaplains who were part of a system intent on eradicating Jews and Judaism. But in our shared human history, different cases of religion and violence are both separate and linked, and although I have ﬁnally stopped writing this book and handed it over to you, the reader, I am still thinking about these connections.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe best part of completing this book after so many years is having the opportunity publicly to thank the many wonderful professionals, colleagues, and friends who helped me get to this point. Let me start with Liz FriendSmith, whose insight, patience, and good judgment I have relied on since our ﬁrst conversation about this project. Earlier, her colleague Michael Watson had encouraged me to return to the Wehrmacht chaplains, and even earlier, my friend Lewis Bateman convinced me that when I was ready, Cambridge University Press would be too. Thank you all! I will be forever grateful to members of the workshop group that convened in March 2020 in Toronto to discuss a draft of this book. We had no idea what COVID-19 would bring. Now, after two years of isolation and disruptions, our time together seems even more precious. Martina Cucchiara, Michaela Hoenicke-Moore, Hartmut Lehmann, Silke Lehmann, Michael Moore, Julia Torrie, James Retallack, and Anna Shternshis, your brilliant, generous, creative engagement with my uneven and incomplete manuscript made all the difference. Also invaluable to the workshop were the contributions of Jessica Bush, Stephanie Corazza, Masha Koyama, Natasha Richichi-Fried, Mayar Shahin, and Galina Vaisman. For funding the workshop in 2020, I am grateful to the Anne Tanenbaum Centre for Jewish Studies, the Wolfe Chair of Holocaust Studies, and the Centre for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies, all at the University of Toronto, and to the Peter and Melanie Munk Foundation. Over the years, many organizations have supported my research: the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Max Planck Institute for History, the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts at the University of Notre Dame, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Librarians, archivists, and photo archivists in Germany, the USA, Israel, and Austria have helped at every step. I want to mention in particular Michael Noth at the Bundesarchiv-Militärchiv in Freiburg/ Br., whose skilled assistance has been vital. I started thinking about Christian chaplains in the Wehrmacht when I was still a graduate student. Gerhard Weinberg immediately recognized the xiv\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxv\n\nsigniﬁcance of the topic and has shown a keen interest in my ﬁndings ever since. Peter Kracht, then at Westview Press, ﬁrst suggested I write a book, and Carol Rittner RSM, John Roth, and Saul Friedländer all enthusiastically backed the idea. Sadly, some of the people whose early (and later) support inspired me are no longer alive to be thanked in person: Helen Bergen, Sam Bergen, John Conway, Lee Ann Fujii, Sara Ginaite, Ronald Hamowy, Michael Marrus, Livia Prince, Gerhart Riegner, Beate Ruhm von Oppen, Annelise Thimme, and Rabbi Max B. Wall. I will never forget you. I owe a debt of gratitude to Marc-André Dufour, Peter Fritzsche, Konstantin Fuks, Manfred Gailus, Steven Maddox, Eliot Nidam, Na’ama Shik, Kevin Spicer, Fabien Théoﬁlakis, and Gavin Wiens for pointing me toward speciﬁc sources.

Entire countries in which I conducted research no longer exist. Some archives have moved, and others have new names. I ﬁrst consulted the ﬁles of the Reich Ministry for Church Affairs in the late 1980s, in the Central State Archive (Zentrales Staatsarchiv) of the German Democratic Republic in Potsdam. Two years later, I returned to those ﬁles in the same location, but it was now the Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv) Potsdam in the newly uniﬁed Germany. That archive has since disappeared, and readers who wish to consult those ﬁles can ﬁnd them in the Federal Archive in Berlin-Lichterfelde. In the 1990s, I conducted research in the Political Archive of the German Foreign Ofﬁce (Politisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts) and the Archive of the Catholic Military Bishop (Archiv des Katholischen Militärbischofs) in Bonn. Both have since moved to Berlin. In Warsaw, I beneﬁted from research in the Archive of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation. That entity has been replaced by the Institute of National Remembrance. In this book, I have retained the names of archives at the time I used them and provided as much information as possible in the notes in the hope that fellow researchers will be able to ﬁnd the materials in their new locations. Spelling of place names in Holocaust Studies is always a challenge. In the text and on the maps, I have tried to balance familiarity, consistency, and sensitivity to political considerations. When there is a widely used Anglicized version of a name, I use that. Rather than the German names, I prefer the Polish (or Czech, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and other) place names. I reject those names invented by Nazi Germany, for example Litzmannstadt, but do use German variants when those are most likely to be recognized by Englishlanguage readers. Thus, in the text and on the maps in this book, you will see Munich, Prague, and Krakow, rather than München, Praha, and Kraków; Wrocław and Poznań, not Breslau and Posen, but Sobibor and Auschwitz, rather than Sobibór and Oświęcim.\n\nxvii\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxviii\n\nNote on the Text\n\nAs I was preparing my manuscript for publication, the present crashed into this past in an unexpected way. The Russian attack on Ukraine that began in February 2022 raised countless questions, including practical ones about the spelling of place names: Kiev or Kyiv? Zhitomir or Zhytomyr, Odessa or Odesa, Zaporozhye or Zaporizhzhia? These choices, in the midst of a war that has already displaced and devastated millions of people, seem at the same time petty and of urgent signiﬁcance. I have opted for Ukrainian place names (or more accurately, the common transliterations of those names) even in cases where a different name is more familiar in English-language Holocaust discourse. Accordingly, I use Kharkiv rather than Kharkov, and Bila Tserkva and Babyn Yar instead of Belaya Tserkov and Babi Yar. No doubt, looking back, some of my choices will seem inappropriate and even wrong, a reﬂection of the current upheavals.\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAA AELKZ AKM AOK AP AP Łódź BA, BArch BA-MA CDU DP EK EZA LKA LKM NARA NL NS NSFO OKH OKW SD USHMM VHA YV ZASP\n\nPolitisches Archiv des Auswärtigen Amts Allgemeine Evangelisch-lutherische Kirchenzeitung Archiv des Katholischen Militärbischofsamts Armee-Oberkommando Archiwum Pansytwowe Archiwum Pansytwowe w Łódźi Bundesarchiv Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands Displaced Person Einsatzkommando Evangelisches Zentralarchiv Landeskirchenarchiv Landeskirchliches Museum National Archives Records Administration Nachlass Nationalsozialistisch Nationalsozialistischer Führungsofﬁzier Oberkommando des Heeres Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Sicherheitsdienst United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Visual History Archive Yad Vashem Zentralarchiv der Evangelischen Kirche der Pfalz\n\nxix\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction An Incongruous Institution\n\nBluntly put, a chaplain is the minister of the Prince of Peace serving in the host of the God of War – Mars. As such, he is as incongruous as a musket would be on the altar at Christmas. Why then is he there? Because he indirectly subserves the purpose attested by the cannon; because too he lends the sanction of the religion of the meek to that which practically is the abrogation of everything but brute Force. Herman Melville, Billy Budd, Sailor\n\nIf God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will He not also give us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justiﬁes. . . . As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.” . . . I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:31-39) Wehrmacht chaplain, sermon to soldiers on Germany’s eastern front, late 1941\n\nBy any standard measure, Hitler’s Germany was a Christian country. Throughout its existence, around 95 percent of its people remained baptized members of the two established churches: Roman Catholic and Protestant (Lutheran, Reformed, and a combination of the two). Germans paid substantial church taxes, which authorities of the National Socialist (Nazi) state collected and passed along to ecclesiastical bodies, just as their predecessors had done in the Weimar Republic and before that in Imperial Germany. Church buildings dominated the streetscape in big cities and villages alike, and Christian traditions and holidays structured daily life, even if they shared the stage at times with rituals invented by Nazi propagandists and neo-pagans. Although German law recognized only civil marriage, many couples still chose to have their unions blessed in a church ceremony. Almost all German children received religious instruction in school from a Catholic priest or a Protestant pastor. With few exceptions, Germans hoped for and received a Christian burial when they died.1 At the time Hitler came to power, Jews, the largest non-Christian minority by far, made up less than 1 percent of the population. 1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnder these circumstances it should come as no surprise that Christian chaplains served the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany’s conscription-based military, from its creation in 1935 until its defeat a decade later. Over the lifetime of Hitler’s regime approximately 1,000 men held ofﬁcial positions as Wehrmacht chaplains.2 Catholic and Protestant in about equal numbers, they accompanied German troops wherever they went: into Poland, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, North Africa, the Soviet Union, and points between and beyond; on the retreats back toward their shrinking homeland; and into POW camps on four continents. Like their counterparts in the British, American, and Canadian militaries, the Wehrmacht chaplains were formally incorporated into the armed forces and held ofﬁcers’ ranks. Like chaplains in those forces, too, they ministered to the men in their care, performed the sacraments, comforted the sick and wounded, and buried the dead. But as part of the German war of annihilation, the Wehrmacht chaplains carried out these familiar tasks under circumstances that raised the stakes to terrifying heights. Whom or what does a chaplain serve? Witnesses to Atrocity A deadly incident illustrates some key themes of this study. In July 1941, advancing Wehrmacht units reached a city in central Ukraine called Bila Tserkva, about midway between Zhytomyr and Kyiv.3 Bila Tserkva – (Бiла Церква) in Ukrainian, Belaya Tserkov (Белая Церковь) in Russian, and Biała Cerkiew in Polish – means “White Church,” speciﬁcally, an Eastern Rite church. Located on the Ros’ River, a tributary of the Dnieper, and major rail lines, the city was an important transportation hub. On the eve of World War II, according to census records, it was home to 9,284 Jews.4 The “big synagogue” was a landmark, as were two Jewish schools. Sholem Aleichem had lived there in the 1880s, and Yiddish culture thrived during the early Soviet period. In 1929, when the ethnomusicologist Moisei Beregovsky set out to collect Jewish songs, he began his expedition in Bila Tserkva. There he recorded hundreds of songs about love, family, and the struggle for social justice.5 Especially fruitful for Beregovsky was the neighborhood of Gruziia. Locals called it “Georgia” because the decrepit housing ﬁt their image of the ramshackle Caucasus. There Grisha London, a teenaged shoemaker, performed a ballad that began, “Oy vey, in 1915, a new decree was issued.” The lyrics lamented the fate of a young recruit in the tsarist army, his family forced to surrender him: “Oh every father must lead his child/like a slaughterer the cattle.” Out on maneuvers on Shabbat, the singer bemoaned, with nothing to eat or drink, “you get slapped too.” Viewed through the prism of the Holocaust, it is hard not to read certain lines as clairvoyant:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nWitnesses to Atrocity\n\n3\n\nOy vey brothers, we’re lost We are in murderous hands, oy vey.\n\nDire as circumstances may have been, however, the balladeer ended by asserting not doom but Jewish agency, at least for men: We took Jewish girls And wasted their lives.6\n\nThe song framed the travails of military service as part of the ongoing drama of Jewish communal existence. Jewish life in Bila Tserkva was diverse and distinctive, but the destruction of Jews there was typical of hundreds of massacres the Germans carried out in the summer of 1941, throughout Ukraine, eastern Poland, and the Baltic states. In Bila Tserkva, members of a mobile killing squad, Sonderkommando 4a of Einsatzgruppe C, conducted most of the murders, with assistance from German Order Police units, Ukrainian auxiliaries, and some of the local population. The killers used techniques that were rapidly becoming standard practice: they rounded up Jews using coercion and deception; commandeered people nearby, sometimes the condemned Jews themselves, to dig pits at designated sites; forced the victims to take off their clothes, and then shot them one small group at a time, so that their bodies fell directly into what became mass graves. Afterward the killers helped themselves to the belongings of the people who were now dead.7 The slaughter of Jews in Bila Tserkva followed standard practice yet differed in a crucial respect from all but a handful of such killings: it drew attention after the war not only in the Soviet Union but also in the west. In 1967–68, eleven members of Sonderkommando 4a stood trial in Darmstadt, West Germany, for the murder of thousands of Jews in the southern Soviet Union. Among those called to testify were two chaplains with the 295th Infantry Division: the Roman Catholic priest Ernst Tewes and the Protestant pastor Gerhard Wilczek.8 Their account of how, in Bila Tserkva, they tried and failed to save a group of Jewish children from death drew international headlines and remains the best known – indeed, the only – documented case of Wehrmacht chaplains intervening on behalf of Nazi Germany’s victims. For the court and in subsequent publications, Father Tewes reproduced events, relying on his memory and notes he had taken at the time. German soldiers had approached him and his Protestant counterpart to ask for their help, he said. According to the soldiers, a large number of children were locked in a school near the ﬁeld hospital. The two clergymen went to see for themselves, and Tewes recalled what they encountered: I am sure I would still recognize that building today. We found about ninety little Jewish children, among them some infants, in a hopeless situation: packed together,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhimpering, crying, hungry and thirsty in the mid-day heat. Most of their parents had been shot, and some of their mothers were conﬁned in an adjacent room. Through a window they could see their children’s agony but they could do nothing to help them. Both of us agreed absolutely that against all orders, we would get involved and put ourselves on the line. The children and their mothers, like so many others before them, were to be shot by an SS Sonderkommando.9\n\nTewes described how he and Wilczek, both young men at the time – he was thirty-one – ﬁrst appealed to the local commander, characterized by Tewes as “an elderly Austrian.” That effort failed, Tewes reported, because the man “turned out to be a convinced antisemite.”10 Then they enlisted the support of two senior chaplains in the area.11 Together the four persuaded Lieutenant Colonel Helmuth Groscurth to take up the cause.12 As Tewes told it, Army High Command approved one postponement, but Security Service representatives and military ofﬁcers on-site prevailed, pointing to instructions from General Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau, commander of the Sixth Army. Eventually, word came from Berlin that all the children and the women were to be killed. On August 21, 1941, the children were taken from the school and shot. No one mentioned the women again. Whether it was Germans – Tewes noted only the possibility it was members of the Waffen-SS – or Ukrainian “volunteers” who did the job the chaplains would not say.13 In a report dated August 1941, they emphasized that the men guarding the school were “Ukrainians,” whom they suspected of acting “on their own initiative.”14 Looking back decades after the massacre at Bila Tserkva, Tewes underscored the image of himself and his fellow chaplain as powerless: “All of the people we tried to save were shot,” he remarked. “Because of our efforts, it just happened a few days later than planned.”15 Tewes’s account constitutes powerful evidence that Wehrmacht chaplains witnessed the Holocaust. Witnessing is not a neutral act, a fact recognized in many traditions where it is taboo to look upon the victims of violence.16 Those who see and watch violence are changed by it – traumatized, brutalized, mobilized, paralyzed.17 At the same time, the presence of witnesses changes the event itself and affects how participants experience and remember it. Tewes’s testimony presents Christian chaplains as tragic ﬁgures, good and decent men who tried and failed to save the lives of innocent children. His version of events was directed at an audience and shaped by its purpose, and like every narrative, it is incomplete. What Tewes left out – whether because he did not know, failed to notice, blocked, forgot, deemed inappropriate, or denied – is as signiﬁcant as what he included for understanding the role of Wehrmacht chaplains during the war and afterward. One thing Tewes omitted was context. His testimony described an isolated event, but the assault on Jews in Bila Tserkva started before and continued\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nWitnesses to Atrocity\n\n5\n\nafter the massacre of the children in the school. Germans arrived in the region in mid-July and began killing Jews immediately. The ﬁrst mass shooting took place on July 14, 1941. In a park by the river, Germans shot ten Jewish men and dumped their bodies in a shallow grave. By the end of the day, they had shot and killed 200 Jews.18 The Red Army report that provided these numbers detailed additional atrocities to follow. Soviet sources also document German and Ukrainian destruction of physical markers of Jewish presence. In 1943 the municipal government of Bila Tserkva demolished the Jewish cemetery. Workers gathered the tombstones, 300 cubic meters in total, and brought them to municipal headquarters, where they were mixed with untreated stone.19 Soviet liberation of the city in January 1944 made the front page of the New York Times.20 That same month, the Soviets created a Commission including local people to investigate evidence of Nazi crimes in the area. According to their report, of 6,000 bodies found 5,000 were Jews, many of them children and women.21 Germans had killed those Jews in plain sight, and eyewitness accounts survived in various forms. Already in 1941, Soviet collectors of Yiddish folklore documented a song about the murder of Jewish children in Bila Tserkva. It located the massacre at the seventh military square, on the outskirts of the city, and sounded the call for revenge: Oy, what should we say and what should we tell, when little children were buried alive. People, this happened on the seventh square; they were buried in a pit like a barrel. The assassins, the fascists, were pleased, – they thought all the Jews had ﬁnally met their end. From the still-fresh graves, one can hear a cry: “People, revenge – take revenge on them!” Not a single drop of their blood will go unanswered – we will destroy, wipe out the murderers. We will crush every one of them into dust, – they will pay for everything, for everything!22\n\nJewish sources tell other stories that offer insight into the situation. In Yiddish, Bila Tserkva was sometimes known as Shvartze Timme (Black Tumah, or black abomination). In Jewish tradition, tumah is associated with withering and decay. A dead body is a site of tumah, not only because the corpse itself is decaying, but also because living people who come into contact with it often suffer emotionally and experience spiritual fragmentation, a counterpart of the corpse’s physical disintegration.23 The play on the city’s name – transposing “white church” to “black rot” – is not only a grim joke but a reference to the history of violence against Jews as remembered and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nimagined there. Jews in the region viewed Bila Tserkva as the epicenter of successive pogroms: in 1648, it was said, the Chmielnicki uprising destroyed the large Jewish community; Jews rebuilt, only to be ravaged again in 1919–1920.24 In the German narrative, the murder of Jewish children in Bila Tserkva was a tragic anomaly in an obscure place with a cumbersome Slavic name. In the story of Shvartze Timme, however, Christians killing Jews was the brutal norm in a place called White Church. Perhaps because of past experience, in 1941, shortly before the Germans arrived, Jewish community leaders arranged to evacuate hundreds of children from Bila Tserkva.25 This feat may explain why the number of children in the August massacre was small relative to the hundreds and thousands of Jewish children Germans were killing all over the region in the summer of 1941. Interviews in the Shoah Foundation collection with two survivors, Dimitri Kalinski and Isaac Piatsetski, provide valuable perspectives. Like the chaplains’ accounts, these testimonies are part of a conversation with an anticipated audience and need to be analyzed accordingly. They are all the more precious because together with the song about the seventh square, they constitute the only Jewish sources I have found on Bila Tserkva in 1941. Dimitri Kalinski was interviewed in 1998 in Nevada. He told the interviewer he was born in 1932 but did not know exactly when or where. By 1939, he said, he was in a boarding school in Bila Tserkva, where he remained “for two winters.” He recalls disjointed episodes: being told in 1941 that “something’s gonna happen in a month’s time,” and experiencing bombs being dropped near the school one night. The next morning, when soldiers appeared, Kalinski and another child set out across the river to ﬁnd a teacher. They were unsuccessful, and Kalinski ended up alone, “wandering around” begging. At one house, people gave him food in exchange for looking after their cow.26 Kalinski remembers being “picked up” by German soldiers in “large trucks that were carrying a lot of people,” though he was the only child. They were driven “quite a ways,” told to get out of the trucks, and then the Germans began shooting. Kalinski implies the location was Babyn Yar: he says the adults kept saying the name and he saw Kyiv burning. He survived because people fell on top of him, he recounts; he crawled out from underneath them and “left the area.” Later, Kalinski told the interviewer, he was put on a cattle train and sent to Auschwitz. The account has the marks of embellishment: did he really survive both of the most infamous killing sites of the Holocaust, Babyn Yar and Auschwitz? Kyiv was burning before the Babyn Yar massacre, but would the ﬁre still have been visible from the ravine? The details on Bila Tserkva seem reliable though: why fabricate a connection to a place his interviewer almost certainly had never heard of? Kalinski may well have evaded the August massacre at the school only to be pulled into another of the many killing actions nearby.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPower and Legitimation\n\n7\n\nThe other survivor, Isaac Piatsetski, had adult memories of Bila Tserkva. Born in 1914 in Kielce, he too was interviewed in 1998, in Florida. After the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, he recalled, he ﬂed east. Drafted into the “Russian army,” he was sent to an army base near the former Polish border. In 1941, after a complicated series of moves, he ended up in Bila Tserkva, where he was arrested by the Soviets. Put to work with other refugees at a brick factory, he was given a place to stay near the train station. There he described seeing evacuations: They were evacuating from the front zone, children – and a lot of Jewish children and Jewish families because it was a Jewish-Ukraine there. Belorussia, there were a lot of Jewish people. And the local commanders were also Jewish, and they put all the trains to their, uh, evacuation. So we met such a train which was evacuating, uh, small children from preschool age – maybe a few hundred – in a separate train.27\n\nPiatsetski’s account includes some ﬂourishes. Notably, his subsequent remark, “The train ended up in Ural,” was probably an assumption based on common knowledge and desire for a positive outcome. How would he know what happened to that particular train? More convincing is the offhand comment that local commanders designated evacuation trains for children, because it emerges in passing and does not serve any immediate interest. Kalinski’s and Piatsetski’s accounts challenge the claim of tragic Christian impotence. At Bila Tserkva, the military chaplains lamented, they were unable to help a single Jewish child. Yet Kalinski, nine years old at the time, managed somehow to save himself. Under intense pressure from the advancing Germans, Soviet efforts succeeded in evacuating hundreds of children from Bila Tserkva to Central Asia. In short, reversing the gaze, looking at events through the eyes of Jews in the region, interrupts the narrative of German military chaplains with a pointed question: How did a massacre of Jews become a story of Christian heroism?\n\nPower and Legitimation Tewes and Wilczek did not stop the murder of the Jewish children at Bila Tserkva but they were by no means powerless. To the contrary, they and the other military chaplains had considerable power by virtue of the ofﬁce they held and the moral authority of Christianity in their society. It is difﬁcult to quantify that power, because it was articulated and exercised for the most part informally, and its practitioners repressed and denied it after the fact. As Michel-Rolph Trouillot trenchantly observed, “The ultimate mark of power may be its invisibility.”28 Yet its traces can be seen even in the events of August 1941 and their aftermath. Soldiers acknowledged the importance of the chaplaincy, for instance at Bila Tserkva where, according to German sources, it was soldiers who\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\napproached the chaplains. Without the soldiers’ initiative, Tewes and Wilczek might not have learned about the children conﬁned in the school or at least they might have avoided coming face-to-face with that reality. Wehrmacht chaplains were ordained Christian clergymen, recognizable by the white and violet armbands they wore with their uniforms and other markers that ranged from subtle – the absence of the signs of rank worn by other ofﬁcers – to more dramatic: cruciﬁxes around their necks; on occasion ceremonial robes. Their physical presence in the midst of a brutal war signaled a kind of normalcy that many Germans read as legitimating. Even when the killers and the Wehrmacht units that accompanied, supported, and sometimes directly assisted them did not see an actual chaplain, they all knew Christian chaplains were part of the war effort, and that knowledge added a protective layer of moral reassurance. Those soldiers who told Tewes and Wilczek about the crying babies locked in the school could feel they had done what they were supposed to do: bring their troubled consciences to the chaplain. Of course things may not have happened as Tewes remembered or recounted them. Perhaps the chaplains learned about the children from their own observations or from the locals among whom they were billeted. The emphasis on the conscience-stricken soldiers ﬁts neatly with other details in Tewes’s testimony that support the myth of the honorable German Army: his description of the antisemitic commander as “Austrian”; his repeated references to the SS as distinct from and opposed to the Wehrmacht; his speculation that “Ukrainian volunteers” did the actual killing.29 Other details slide easily into insinuations of Jewish passivity, even complicity: note the image of Jewish women helplessly watching through a window as their children suffered, when in fact it was the chaplains who were passively peering in. (Why would there be a window between two rooms inside a small building?) But even with its self-serving elements, Tewes’s account makes clear that chaplains had the standing to approach military commanders and the credibility to testify years later in court, as representatives of an intact Christian conscience within the Wehrmacht. Military, state, and Party leaders regarded the chaplaincy as a moral force, even if that recognition was sometimes backhanded. Soon after the murder of the Jews in Bila Tserkva, both Tewes and Wilczek were transferred to different units. Nothing suggests this step was punitive, nor was it unusual. Nevertheless, given the tendency for chaplains to remain with the same units as long as possible, it could be that the transfers were a deliberate effort to distance Tewes and Wilczek from the men who had been with them at Bila Tserkva. Why allow seeds of conscience to take root or encourage misgivings to be shared with a sympathetic audience? Certainly the Wehrmacht leadership was eager to forestall discussion of moral qualms. In October 1941, Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau issued\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPower and Legitimation\n\n9\n\nhis infamous directive to address “uncertainty regarding behavior of the troops” in the east. To destroy the “Jewish Bolshevist system,” he assured his men, Germany was compelled to bypass the rules of war and show no mercy to “Jewish subhumans.”30 Murmurings of discontent about the active part the Wehrmacht had played in the slaughter of Jews at Babyn Yar just weeks earlier appear to have prompted Reichenau to take the unusual step of justifying himself to the men under his command and assuming the burden of moral responsibility. But the spark of conscience the chaplains showed at Bila Tserkva may also have contributed to Reichenau’s directive, especially since it was Reichenau, at least as Tewes and others told it, who gave the order to have the children killed.31 Chaplains themselves had a sense of their authority. In his postwar recollections of Bila Tserkva, Tewes acknowledged the potential power of his position, something he said he fully grasped only later. It was in the 1968 courtroom, he claimed, that he learned he and Wilczek had been investigated: we who had set in motion this whole thing from within the Army against the SS. I learned that the High Commander of the 6th Army, who was in charge of this southern sector of the front, General Field Marshal von Reichenau himself, had personally intervened in this matter, sharply criticized our meddling, and clearly planned to take measures against us.32\n\nYet the two chaplains were not punished, nor is there evidence that their actions at Bila Tserkva damaged their careers. Tewes’s new assignment, to an armored division in Russia, was dangerous but not unusually so. In his version of events, German atrocities were a lamentable part of warfare, balanced by the perilous conditions there. “There were partisans,” he observed in describing his new post in his reminiscences. “German soldiers and ofﬁcers were shot in partisan attacks. Then there were the terrible reprisals, shootings of hostages, to which Jews and others fell victim.”33 In the mind of Chaplain Tewes – or at least in the way he presented his past to the world – the targets of Nazi violence had changed from innocent children to dangerous bandits. One argument of this book is that the German military chaplaincy helped legitimize Hitler’s regime and its genocidal war. Wehrmacht chaplains were effective legitimators precisely because they stood somewhat apart from the overt proponents and practitioners of violence. Although Christianity and Nazism coexisted, they were not identical, and Tewes, Wilczek, and their fellow chaplains abhorred such crimes as the murder of children. Their inﬂuence, however, depended less on individual intent than on the prestige of military chaplaincy and the venerable tradition of Christianity in Germany. Like the chaplain Melville described in Billy Budd,34 the Wehrmacht chaplains were all the more effective in sanctioning force because they represented a self-proclaimed “religion of the meek.”35\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Wehrmacht chaplains’ moral authority made them key to creating a reassuring version of events for the soldiers and families to whom they ministered and also for themselves. Over the course of the war, they developed a vested interest in a narrative that normalized atrocity or elided it with German suffering. If they felt shame about their country’s crimes, they could hide it behind blame of the victims, a process facilitated by propaganda that depicted Jews as a mortal threat to Germany, the sinister force behind its military foes. Chaplains were not the only people to engage in this sleight of hand: Jews were to be “exterminated as partisans,” Hitler reportedly told Himmler.36 Turning the Holocaust into a Christian morality tale served to transform Jews from victims to enemies and then to erase them from the story altogether. The Wehrmacht chaplains enabled killing but they were not themselves hands-on killers. In thirty years of researching this subject, I have not found evidence that German chaplains personally killed Jews, Soviet prisoners of war, or civilians in occupied Poland or elsewhere. They were permitted to carry a sidearm, usually a pistol, while at the front or in occupied territory, and some of them boasted about participating in combat. In many circumstances, however, they were unarmed. The intervention by German military chaplains at Bila Tserkva was almost certainly a singular event. Why did other Wehrmacht chaplains, who also witnessed or had direct knowledge of extreme violence – rape of Polish, Jewish, and Soviet women;37 mass murder of Black French soldiers, Norwegian and Soviet prisoners of war, Jews in Lithuania and Belarus, Christian civilians in Yugoslavia and Greece – not raise comparable objections? Indeed, why did the chaplains at Bila Tserkva not follow up their protestation there with further actions? Both Tewes and Wilczek continued in their jobs until the end of the war, and apparently neither of them caused any subsequent trouble. This book identiﬁes four factors that together explain the Wehrmacht chaplains’ patterns of behavior. One was the institutional structure of the chaplaincy, which rewarded cautious leadership and weeded out potential troublemakers. A second factor involved the chaplains’ defensive position vis-à-vis the Nazi regime and a general crisis of relevance for the churches in the modern era. War itself, above all the confusion and moral numbing it entailed, was a third factor, and a fourth was time: the passage of time and habits and patterns formed over time. The Wehrmacht chaplaincy of 1941 – of the war of annihilation and the Shoah – would not have been possible in 1933, but chaplains would not have become what they were by then without the developments of 1935, 1939, and 1940.38 By the same token, chaplains’ actions in 1941 shaped their behavior in the years that followed and how they remembered and represented it.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nSystems and Dynamics\n\n11\n\nSystems and Dynamics Institutions, professions, and the systems that govern them have their own logic. Rather than asking why German chaplains were silent in the face of Nazi murder of Jews, it can be more fruitful to ask why there was no apparatus for them to protest or articulate opposition to the state.39 What structures generated certain options for what they did and perceived they could or should do? What dynamics channeled their actions, including those that went against the rules, into legitimation of the dominant system? A key factor was the way chaplains were selected. Appointment of military chaplains involved a multistep process that privileged men who counted as theological and political moderates. Local bishops proposed names, which the Ministry of Church Affairs, the appropriate military bishop (Catholic or Protestant), and the Gestapo then vetted. About one-third of the men considered were rejected. On the Catholic side, this meant above all keeping out priests who had been involved in youth work that contravened police restrictions. On the Protestant side, it usually meant excluding clergy with a strong record of activity in the Confessing Church, because it had opposed Nazi efforts to control who held church ofﬁces. Once selected, chaplains went through training processes and participated in professionalization events of various kinds. These shared experiences, along with a sense of duty to their calling, exerted a palpable inﬂuence on them. To be a military chaplain meant to be a soldier, to be manly, to serve one’s country and one’s faith. If the ofﬁce shapes the man, the leaders set the tone. Two military bishops headed the Wehrmacht chaplaincy, the Catholic Franz Justus Rarkowski and the Protestant Franz Dohrmann.40 In position by 1935, Rarkowski and Dohrmann in effect created the chaplaincy that served in World War II. They were responsible for appointing chaplains and they represented the churches’ interests to the military and military interests to the churches. Both men were traditional patriots who had served in World War I. Neither was a member of the Nazi Party, and both proved willing to speak out to protect the institution of the chaplaincy when they considered it threatened by the Party or state. This independence, in turn, gave them credibility that made them more effective as legitimators of the regime than ardent Nazis could have been. Legitimation is a two-way street, and if the Nazi regime needed the German military chaplains, chaplains may have needed the regime even more. Their credibility and entire reason for existing depended on their bond with war and the men who fought it. Yet soldiers’ taunts of irrelevance echoed around the Wehrmacht chaplains, most loudly during periods of German ascendancy, quieter but with a bitter tone in times of setback. Who needed God if they were winning? And if they were losing, had God not failed them? Meanwhile,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nsome Nazi ideologues were openly hostile, regarding chaplains as rivals who propagated an outmoded and enfeebling world view. A series of measures introduced over the course of the war indicate that policy makers sought to curb the chaplaincy’s impact and perhaps eventually phase it out altogether. Chaplains responded with what I call “compensatory compliance”: they tried to forestall criticism by proving they were essential ﬁghters for Germany.41 They publicized evidence that soldiers and ofﬁcers regarded them as necessary to maintain morale, particularly when casualties were high. They engaged in ostentatious demonstrations of loyalty to Hitler, including special prayers and services on his birthday and other occasions.42 This dynamic, readily apparent in contemporary sources, recedes from view in chaplains’ postwar accounts. Those tend to downplay cooperation with the regime and emphasize its hostility, consistent with the chaplains’ pattern of protecting their institutional interests.43 Like the chaplains, under Hitler the Christian churches as a whole occupied a defensive position vis-à-vis actual and imagined critics. On the one hand, Christian leaders enjoyed enhanced recognition and prestige. During wartime, the importance of the churches grew, because they sanctiﬁed sacriﬁce and comforted the bereaved, tasks the German leadership increasingly valued as casualties among their own people mounted. On the other hand, elements within the Nazi movement were suspicious of Christianity. After all, Christianity grew out of Judaism and called on its followers to “love your enemies” and “turn the other cheek” – attitudes antithetical to the Nazi worldview. Hitler did not destroy German churches or persecute ordinary Christians, but ofﬁcials imposed restrictions and police practiced forms of harassment to keep the churches in line. Often state or Party accusations of Christian weakness sparked church leaders to redouble efforts to prove their value to the nation. A wider, older struggle of religious leaders to remain relevant in changing times is crucial to understanding German chaplains in the mid-twentieth century. Scholars of religion have abandoned a simple secularization thesis, with its assumption that modernity replaced “traditional religion” with other loyalties. Political religion – the sacralization of a leader, a party, a cause – turns out to coexist easily with “religious religion,” or, to put it differently, religion is always intertwined with political, social, and familial relations.44 Nor did religion simply get squeezed from public into private spaces. Often the opposite occurred, as individuals became less attentive to religious practice and belief in their personal affairs but remained ﬁrmly located within Christian frameworks. In an era of “diffusive religion,”45 Christian leaders and institutions sought out sites where they could wield inﬂuence explicitly as well as implicitly. Germany’s military chaplaincy turned out to be such a site, but it\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nThe Fog of War and the Force of Habit\n\n13\n\nwas laden with risk: credibility hung by a thread and particular institutional interests sometimes trumped the churches’ broader goals. This state of affairs made churchmen nervous, and the chaplaincy typiﬁed that unease. The existing institutional arrangement seemed proof of the ongoing vitality of Christianity in modern German society, yet if chaplains could not demonstrate their value to established power structures, for instance by building morale, the churches stood to lose that platform. Church representatives worried that their target audiences – men, and speciﬁcally soldiers – were indifferent to religion. They hoped to use their institutional presence in the military to gain a place in individual hearts and minds. But if chaplains sold out the interests of their clientele, or if soldiers perceived them to have done so, the churches would lose credibility. Military chaplaincy, in other words, was a major arena for representatives of the churches to demonstrate their relevance and perform their loyalty. When Germany rearmed in March 1935, Catholics and Protestants successfully lobbied for immediate appointment of military bishops to create a Wehrmacht chaplaincy. The chaplains proved to be reliable partners. In Spain, where the new air force’s Condor Legion dropped bombs in 1937, at least one chaplain was there too, celebrating the triumph over what Nazi propaganda called Jewish Bolshevism. When Hitler purged the military leadership in 1938, not a single chaplain lost his post. No chaplains (indeed, no German church leaders) protested in August 1939 when the Molotov– Ribbentrop Pact was signed, although earlier they had been vociferous critics of Communism. Nor did any of the chaplains who accompanied the Wehrmacht in the invasion of Poland in September 1939 join the handful of bishops and military ofﬁcers who spoke out against the assault on Polish civilians, including Roman Catholic priests and Jews. Likewise the massacre of French Black soldiers in 1940, the vicious reprisal killings in the Balkans, the rape of Soviet women,46 and murder of millions of Soviet prisoners of war – all violence carried out by the Wehrmacht,47 not special SS units – elicited no protest, at least none that has left a trace in the records – although military chaplains were present at all those places. The Fog of War and the Force of Habit What did Wehrmacht chaplains actually do? This simple question draws attention to the deep uncertainty of their circumstances and the complex ways that war both magniﬁed and limited their agency.48 Chaplains were deployed across the enormous territory conquered by the Wehrmacht and occupied by Nazi Germany. The nearest fellow chaplain or supervisor could be hundreds, even thousands of miles away. As a result, chaplains operated under\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nremarkably little oversight. This degree of independence set them apart from other professionals under Nazism – schoolteachers, social workers, or clergy serving civilian parishes – and made the position attractive to ambitious men. In addition, the ofﬁcer’s rank that chaplains held provided a protective layer of prestige. No one in Nazi Germany had to be coerced into becoming a military chaplain: the number of aspirants always outstripped the number of appointments. Even Dietrich Bonhoeffer at one point considered entering the chaplaincy.49 Yet the Wehrmacht chaplains’ position was also circumscribed in signiﬁcant ways. Although chaplains had considerable leeway, isolation left them exposed and vulnerable to certain pressures. Their ability to function depended on the relationships they cultivated with the men physically closest to them: commanding ofﬁcers, military doctors, and soldiers. Without a means of transportation – a motorized vehicle and fuel, a bicycle or horse – a chaplain was useless, no matter how lofty his intentions. Chaplains expended enormous amounts of time and energy in daily struggles to locate the men for whom they were responsible, to obtain supplies, or to source and distribute religious reading material. The vicissitudes of war had a particular impact on chaplains, whose ability to perform the most fundamental tasks – visit the wounded and sick, administer the sacraments, bury the dead – could be nulliﬁed by a sudden movement of the front, an ambush, or a blizzard. The stresses of what one chaplain delicately referred to as the “special nature of our war in the East” added to the burden. Under such circumstances, there was little time to read the Bible, pray, or even think. And thinking, as Hannah Arendt pointed out, is the essence of ethical existence.50 One obvious explanation for the Wehrmacht chaplains’ behavior is missing from the discussion so far. What about conviction in the Nazi cause? Certainly some chaplains are on record as staunch Nazis. One of my earliest encounters with the topic involved a German Lutheran pastor in Luseland, Saskatchewan (Canada), who wrote to the Protestant military bishop in 1936 begging to be appointed to the chaplaincy so he could serve the Führer.51 (Neither he nor a Baptist pastor who wrote a similar request around the same time was accepted.) Active members of the pro-Nazi German Christian movement also sought positions. In some high-proﬁle cases they succeeded: Chief Navy Chaplain Friedrich Ronneberger and Dean of Chaplains Heinrich Lonicer were the two most prominent. However, some clergy were disqualiﬁed from the chaplaincy as being too fanatically pro-Nazi, and nothing indicates that men signed on as chaplains in order to kill Jews or other supposed enemies. The SS murder squads known as Einsatzgruppen did include former Christian clergy, most infamously the Lutheran theologian Ernst Biberstein, head of Sonderkommando 6 of Einsatzgruppe C,52 and their murderous activities raise\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nThe Fog of War and the Force of Habit\n\n15\n\nurgent and neglected questions about Christians as perpetrators of genocide. Such men, however, did not become chaplains, or if they did, they left no trace. Were the chaplains Nazis? A more fruitful question asks how people who were not fervent Nazis or eager killers ended up playing an essential role in atrocity. One response can be found in the letters of Konrad Jarausch, a Protestant theologian who served with the Wehrmacht in the invasions and occupations of Poland and the Soviet Union. A devout educator and publicist, Jarausch was committed to serving his country and his faith. By autumn 1941 a master sergeant, he was put in charge of the kitchen in a camp that held thousands of sick, starving, and dying Soviet prisoners of war. Sergeant Jarausch tried his best to keep order. His hand became swollen from dealing out blows, he told his wife. And yet he felt empathy for the prisoners and became close to some of them. In his words, it was “already more murder than war.” Jarausch died of typhoid fever in January 1942. His letters show neither the “clean Wehrmacht” nor Naziﬁed killers but dutiful, if reluctant, accomplices.53 This book is organized chronologically, because while writing it I discovered that lines of continuity and change only became visible when I put developments in order. Following the chronology highlighted a factor often neglected in historical analyses: force of habit, at a personal and an institutional level. The Nazi period divides equally into the six prewar years from 1933 to 1939 and six years of World War II. The years of peace – or more accurately, of Hitler talking peace while preparing for war – are of key importance in showing how the chaplaincy developed to play the role it did during Germany’s wars of annihilation.54 Even before its ofﬁcial launch in 1935, the Wehrmacht chaplaincy adjusted and accommodated itself to the National Socialist regime. It was built on tracks and looked back to patterns established during the previous world war and Germany’s short-lived colonial empire. Christian chaplains were present in German Southwest Africa during the genocide of the Herero and Nama;55 chaplains witnessed atrocities against civilians during World War I, and some former chaplains loudly stumped for Hitler and the National Socialist Party during the Weimar years.56 In short, Germany’s eastern front in 1941 was an escalation but not an aberration, either from what came before or from what followed, or even from the war in the west and the southeast. The habit of cooperation, part of the chaplaincy’s raison d’être, proved hard to break, and the higher the stakes became, the less likely it was that chaplains – those at the top of the hierarchy and those at the bottom – would venture out of the deep ruts of their well-worn path. One compromise led to another, and each subsequent step in one direction raised the cost of turning back. When does a compromise become a betrayal? When does it turn into a trap?\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nLooking backward and forward from the murder of the Jewish children at Bila Tserkva highlights continuities in both directions. Study of the Wehrmacht chaplains reveals the ongoing viability of Christianity in Germany even after defeat in 1945. People seemed to need institutionalized Christianity, and it outlived Nazism, although in a weakened form. But continuities can be paradoxical. After World War II, both the German military and its chaplaincy fell out of view, only to be reinvigorated by the Cold War and the interests of NATO. In West Germany in the 1950s, creation of the new Bundeswehr was accompanied by considerable debate around how to constitute the military chaplaincy. It took two years for the new chaplaincy to be set up, and the result looked completely different from its World War II predecessor. Chaplains no longer held an ofﬁcer’s rank, and their purpose was not to boost morale but to be a voice of conscience within the military. In the German Democratic Republic there were to be no military chaplains at all. Rarely did anyone mention Jews or other victims of Nazism in the public discussions about how to reconﬁgure the German chaplaincy. But Jews were remembered, if vaguely and uneasily, in articles like one published in 1965. In the Protestant journal Junge Kirche (young church), the theologian Uwe Lütjohann invoked the Holocaust as a call for Christian repentance: The evil in the church must be pulled out by the roots. The military chaplaincy of World War II only helps us now if we learn from its mistakes. Genuine military chaplaincy today leads us back to the law of Christ, that we love our enemies. And only a perverted deﬁnition of love can mean killing our enemies.57\n\nSources and Methods This book is part of a wave of research on the Holocaust that surged in the early 1990s and endures decades later.58 I build on older scholarship on German military chaplains,59 more recent contributions,60 and the revival of interest in the crimes of the Wehrmacht associated with an 1995 exhibition in Germany and the ensuing controversy.61 My study also ﬁts into a body of work that examines Christianity under Nazism. Some studies deal only with Catholics;62 another group focuses on Protestants.63 I consider all the Wehrmacht chaplains, Protestants and Catholics, together, as part of a wider conversation about the connections between religion, war, and genocide.64 Sources for this study include chaplains’ periodic reports to their superiors; correspondence among church and state authorities; chaplains’ letters and diaries, and eyewitnesses’ postwar recollections.65 I use all of these materials in order to see the chaplains as historical actors with personalities, values, theological and political positions. It is not my goal to recreate the chaplains’ inner world, however.66 As I have thought about this subject over many years, I have wondered whether starting the story in 1941 in Germany’s east and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nSources and Methods\n\n17\n\nletting chaplains speak for themselves without analyzing their accounts risks reproducing a self-justifying version of events. Chaplains were active agents in constructing their own narrative, as individuals and collectively, and my analysis considers such efforts to be an integral part of their history.67 Accordingly, I try to interrupt records by the Wehrmacht chaplains with sources that offer other perspectives.68 Integrated histories of the Holocaust shift and reverse the gaze to disrupt grand narratives with the voices of victims, in particular Jewish victims.69 This book applies that method. Outside sources are not easy to ﬁnd, because rarely did anyone other than chaplains mention chaplains. Nonetheless, German troops, French prisoners of war, members of SS killing squads, captured Jews, civilians under German occupation, and Allied authorities all encountered Wehrmacht chaplains, and some of them recorded their impressions. In a letter home, a German soldier described the execution of a comrade convicted for desertion and noted the presence of a chaplain at the condemned man’s side. A young Leningrad woman conﬁded to her diary her admiration for the German chaplain who presided over the reopening of a church.70 An SS report complained that Wehrmacht chaplains caused friction among locals in Ukraine by holding church services for different Christian denominations. Even such ﬂeeting glances provide a valuable corrective to the view from inside the chaplaincy. Integrated approaches to history invite attention to gender, sexuality, bodies, and the materiality of everyday life. When I started this project, paying attention to gender did not seem that important to me. But now I consider it essential. The Wehrmacht chaplains held two positions only men could hold: they were Christian clergy and members of the military.71 Chaplains constantly invoked notions of manliness – their own and that of others – although they did not explain what they understood “manliness” to mean.72 They were more explicit in describing Christian morality, which they tried to uphold among soldiers by railing against sex with enemy women.73 Representations of military chaplains in German history and culture are essential to this study. I have drawn on literary and other creative sources: novels and ﬁlms, and even popular representations of military chaplains in other times and places. These materials have helped me break out of some preconceived notions about the Wehrmacht chaplains and also illuminated certain issues common to many chaplaincies. One such issue is the quest for relevance, which is evident in ﬁctional accounts of chaplains from Jaroslav Hašek’s The Good Soldier Svejk all the way to Mort Walker’s long-running comic strip, Beetle Bailey. Photographs are valuable sources, and they too require interpretation. Early in my research I happened upon a remarkable exhibit in a regional church museum in Ludwigsburg, based on the papers of Bernhard Bauerle, a Protestant chaplain with the German 16th Army. Bauerle’s daughter had found\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\na cache of his correspondence after he died, and she donated it to the museum. Two curators did a superb job of organizing that material into a thoughtprovoking display.74 The contrast is striking between what Bauerle wrote and what his photographs depicted: alongside claims that “we had nothing to do with attacks on the Jews,” he archived a photo of an emaciated individual, who was labeled on the reverse side of the photo, in Bauerle’s hand, as Jude (Jew). Silence regarding German killing of Soviets is belied by images of walking skeletons gnawing on bones and corpses hanging from nooses, captioned Kriegsgefangene and Partisanen (prisoners of war and partisans). To Bauerle it seems, both aspects were important: the articulation of noninvolvement, even innocence, and the evidence of witnessing. I have puzzled over that tension and come to view it as central to understanding the Wehrmacht chaplains, who functioned, like their counterparts in other settings, under a “sign of contradiction.”75 Every source, whether written, visual, or oral, is produced at a certain time, and what “the time” is inﬂuences what the source says, who reads or hears it, and how.76 Many of the most detailed and certainly the most personal accounts of German military chaplains come from after the war, often long after. These materials reﬂect the world around them. For instance, by the 1990s, it had become unacceptable among educated people to talk about the Nazi period without mentioning the Holocaust, speciﬁcally the persecution and killing of Jews.77 Chaplains who wrote memoirs decades after the war internalized that convention. Recognizing this process does not make later accounts worthless, but they need to be analyzed with an eye to the multiple contexts they reﬂect. A concrete example illustrates my point. A few years ago, in a small archive in Berlin, I read an extensive diary by Alphons Satzger, a Wehrmacht chaplain.78 Satzger was already known to me from wartime records.79 A Roman Catholic, he won acclamation and an Iron Cross when in 1941, armed only with a pistol, he captured twenty-one Red Army soldiers. The diary, sixty-ﬁve pages long, was a historian’s dream: articulate, detailed, and deeply introspective. It was even typed. Unlike the dry, ofﬁcial reports chaplains submitted to their military superiors, this document overﬂowed with feeling. The author described his horror when, in early July 1941, he accompanied German troops into Lviv and witnessed the massive violence against Jews there. I knew German military chaplains must have been present at this site of carnage, but I had never before found one who mentioned it. Here was not only a ﬂeeting reference to the violence but a detailed account of how a chaplain reacted. In vivid prose Satzger depicted his venture into the prison, where locals had found corpses of victims killed by the retreating Soviets. Antisemites seized on this evidence to launch an all-out assault on Jews in the region, dragging hundreds of them into the prison, forcing them to dispose\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nSources and Methods\n\n19\n\nof the rotted bodies and scrub walls and ﬂoors, and then murdering them there. The sickening stench, Father Satzger wrote, stayed in his uniform for days.80 That remark about the smell jumped off the page. Graphic and speciﬁc, it is the kind of detail that makes personal accounts so unforgettable. And I have no reason to doubt that it is true. But how would Satzger have known on July 4 – the day he entered the prison and the date of the diary entry describing what he saw there – how many days later the stench of death would still linger in his clothes? As I read on, I found other things that could only have been added after the fact: comments about the outcome of developments that could not yet have been known, details about military locations and operations that were not to be revealed, and use of terms that were not in currency in the 1940s. What is more, there was a pattern: almost all of the tell-tale signs appeared within entries that dealt directly with wartime atrocities, especially against Jews. In other words, precisely those passages that made this diary so different from ﬁrsthand accounts written during the war were almost certainly added afterward, with the beneﬁt of hindsight and aligned with contemporary mores.81 This is not to say the diary is a fraud. Indeed, in a note at the end, Satzger mentioned that he retyped it in the 1970s, and he did not deny he made revisions. The researcher can ﬁnd much of value here, but the diary is no clear window into the chaplain’s wartime soul. Because the Wehrmacht chaplains cannot be seen without looking back from our own present, this study also reveals linkages between the past and what follows it. For my experience, September 11, 2001 is signiﬁcant. When the planes struck the World Trade Center towers in New York, I had already been working on the Wehrmacht chaplains for a decade. But in the 1990s, religion was a hard sell for a historian of modern Europe. The 9/11 attacks and the response in the United States, where I lived and worked at the time, changed that: they sparked a new interest in the intersections of religion and violence, often construed in Islamophobic terms.82 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan added a speciﬁc focus on military chaplains, and suddenly I found that work I had done made me an “expert,” called on to comment on such issues as the signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst Muslim and Buddhist chaplains in the US Armed Forces.83 Decades later, the sobering tale of the Wehrmacht chaplains continues to resonate with current events.84 Increased attention to systemic racism in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a white police ofﬁcer in 2020, and exposure of institutional complicity in genocide of Indigenous people in Canada have sharpened my approach.85 In the epigraph I chose from Billy Budd, Melville characterizes the military chaplain as “incongruous,” an embodiment of the contradiction between the violence of war and the “Prince of Peace.” Were the Wehrmacht chaplains any different in this regard from their counterparts in other times and places?\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the emergence of the institution, military chaplains have served the cause of war.86 Like German chaplains in World War II, others must sometimes have felt pulled in opposite directions by unconditional loyalty to the military and the implicit claim of righteousness. Maybe others, too, found relief in mild acts of deﬁance that, though they carried a risk, ended up normalizing brutal systems. The Wehrmacht chaplaincy acted as an insulating layer, protecting German soldiers from listening to their consciences or reﬂecting on Christian teachings. That buffer also covered the chaplains themselves and absorbed objections they may have had. The chaplaincy became a cone of silence, a tunnel. Precisely this reinforcing, silencing effect necessitates an integrated approach to research. In order to see the tunnel, you have to get inside and outside of it. Only people on the outside can get an impression of its overall shape. The testimony of Agnes Adachi provides such a glimpse. Born in 1918 to Hungarian Jewish parents, Adachi (then Agnes Mandl) lived, traveled, and attended school in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and France. By 1944, she had returned to Budapest, where she was baptized a Protestant Christian. Through a complicated chain of events, the charismatic, multilingual Adachi ended up working with the Swedish businessman and diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in his mission to rescue Jews.87 In a 1996 interview with the Shoah Foundation, she sketched this horrifying scene: There was a little child, with a star, who had evidently lost her parents, and there was a church, and out came a Catholic priest wearing inside his collar the Hungarian Nazi collar, and he had a revolver. And he saw that little kid, and he shot her. . . . I picked up the child, and she was dead.88\n\nAdachi’s shocking account raises a number of questions. Was the man a chaplain? What is a “Hungarian Nazi collar?” Where was the church? What was Adachi doing there? Did she shape this account for maximum impact: an innocent little girl gunned down by a devil in disguise? Could she be describing András Kun, the Catholic priest, Arrow Cross leader, and notorious killer of Jews in Budapest?89 Considering multiple perspectives and reading for narratives, as well as evidence, cannot necessarily provide answers but it does promise insight. My method in this book is to afford sources like Adachi’s – the incomplete, ﬂawed, tainted-by-hindsight voices of victims and observers outside the chaplaincy – the same analytical attention I give to sources from chaplains and those close to them. Conversely, I try to approach accounts such as Chaplain Tewes’s testimony in court or Chaplain Satzger’s diary – incomplete, ﬂawed, and tainted by hindsight – with the reﬂexive skepticism and theoretical consideration that many scholars of the Holocaust bring to survivor testimonies.90\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nSources and Methods\n\n21\n\nDiscerning Christianity’s role in the Holocaust requires listening to chaplains’ narratives and also to accounts that supplement and challenge them. The past appears different from divergent perspectives. To Wehrmacht Chaplain Eberhard Müller, whose sermon to German soldiers in occupied Soviet territory is quoted in the second epigraph, the war and the Holocaust were folded into a story of God’s boundless love for His people.91 To Agnes Adachi, who as a young woman saw Germans and their Hungarian partners destroy her family and community, genocide looked like a Christian priest murdering a Jewish child in front of a church.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1\n\n“We Will Not Let Our Swords Get Rusty” On the Cusp of 1933\n\nOn April 4, 1932, the Garrison Church in Potsdam opened its doors – or at least its doorway – to torch-bearing Stormtroopers who stood guard as formations of the National Socialist German Workers Party, Stormtroopers, and the SS paraded into the church. Arriving directly from a speech by Adolf Hitler, who was campaigning for election, they had come to pay homage at the tomb of Frederick the Great.1 Twenty church members signed a letter decrying what they called the desecration of Old Fritz’s grave, and a Potsdam city ofﬁcial complained that the church council had overstepped its authority, but no one was disciplined. For years the church had hosted similar events, supported by members of its clergy and organized by the German National People’s Party (DNVP), the veterans’ association the Stahlhelm, relatives of the deposed Kaiser, the German Association of Military Ofﬁcers (Deutsche Ofﬁzierbund), and many others. Although this was the ﬁrst time the organizer was listed as the Nazi Party, the script and cast of characters remained more or less the same. One key ﬁgure was the Protestant pastor of the military congregation, Curt Koblanck. He had held that position since 1925, after serving as divisional chaplain and then chaplain at other garrisons during the Great War. Koblanck was actively connected to an array of right-radical groups, but by mid-1932 he was focusing his energies on the Nazi Party. In November of that year, he addressed a Party rally with a call to ﬁght democracy: “We will not let our swords get rusty but will defend our positions,” he vowed.2 Koblanck was no outlier. His predecessor, Johannes Vogel, a chaplain in the German Army since 1904, was even more stridently pro-Nazi. Already in 1926, Vogel spoke at a ceremony to bless Stormtrooper ﬂags and praised the swastika as a symbol of Christianity united with old Germanentum. Known as a vehement antisemite, Vogel regularly preached and presided at events in Potsdam’s Protestant churches throughout the Weimar period.3 In July 1932, Pastor Vogel showed up at his local polling station wearing a huge swastika on his chest. The spectacle at the Garrison Church raises the central question of this chapter: What was the relationship between Germany’s military chaplains, 22\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108767712.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n“We Will Not Let Our Swords Get Rusty”\n\n23\n\nNazism, and Nazis before Hitler came to power? The question seems simple, but it is not easy to answer. One complicating factor is hindsight. Looking back, it is impossible not to view torchlit Stormtroopers swarming into a church in 1932 as an early scene in the catastrophic drama of Nazi Germany. Indeed, Koblanck, Vogel, and the Garrison Church in Potsdam would all feature again in the twelve-year show of support for Hitler.4 But the spectacle in April 1932 was both the beginning of something new and the culmination of preceding developments. It also merits attention as a moment in itself, contingent and replete with possibilities. Together with the other events analyzed in this chapter, it shows that the chaplaincy’s embrace of Hitler’s regime was foreseeable, though not inevitable. Visible in the scene at the church are four issues that shaped the chaplains’ relationship to Nazism on the eve of 1933, established patterns for the years to follow, and continue to inﬂuence how this history is viewed. One factor is that in German society, military chaplains carried signiﬁcance far beyond their immediate function. Connected to the divine through prayers and sacraments, chaplains had the power to bestow legitimacy, as Pastor Vogel did when he blessed the swastika and wore it on his chest like a crusader’s cross. Chaplains bound Christianity to the nation state and its past, present, and future, just as Pastor Koblanck served as the link between “Old Fritz” and the Stormtroopers at the door. To church leaders and nationalist Christians – and to chaplains themselves – military chaplains, with their congregations of soldiers, embodied hope for the revival and remasculinization of Christianity in Germany. A second, dialectically related factor is that military chaplains on the cusp of 1933 perceived their situation as weak. With Germany’s armed forces cut to 100,000 men under the Treaty of Versailles,5 most of the old guard had needed new jobs. Instead of several thousand chaplains, as had served the Imperial Germany Army, there were now just a hundred or so. Koblanck’s deﬁant words conjure an image of chaplains defending an exposed position, surrounded by enemies, waving their aging and tarnished swords. Shackled to the lost war and grasping for relevance in a society they feared had little interest in organized religion, chaplains and former chaplains sought new partners and new purpose. A third point, less immediately apparent, is that chaplains actively constructed self-serving narratives, and these constitute many of the existing sources for the period in question. It was Pastor Koblanck himself who documented the procession in April 1932. Reports he and others produced in subsequent years present a teleology that culminated in Nazi triumphs. It was not predestined that military"
