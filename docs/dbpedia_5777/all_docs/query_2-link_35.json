Berghahn Books, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nIn general surveys of the Weimar Republic, the figure of General Walther Reinhardt appears at two points – as the quixotic opponent of the treaty of Versailles, who advocated continuing the war on German territory in order to save the honour of a nation, and as the one honourable general who sought to rally the Reichswehr behind the government during the Kapp Putsch in March 1920.1 He is then ushered off the stage. Yet Reinhardt is a significant figure in the history of the Reichswehr, and – as this study will argue – the most significant figure between November 1918 and March 1920. After resigning in the aftermath of the Kapp Putsch, he continued to serve in the army until 1927, and after he left the army he lectured on military affairs to young officers in Berlin. He has been overshadowed by his successor as head of the army command (Chef der Heeresleitung), Hans von Seeckt, by his fellow Württemberger, Wilhelm Groener, and by the éminence grise of the Weimar republic, Kurt von Schleicher, all of whom have rightly received substantial attention from historians of the period.2 This study is concerned principally with the period between November 1918 and March 1920, when Reinhardt was the officer responsible for the transition to the peacetime army. During this period as head of the Demobilization Department in November and December 1918, as Prussian Minister of War from January 1919 until October 1919, and finally as Chef der Heeresleitung from October 1919 until the Kapp Putsch 1.

He undermined the soldiers’ councils, he established the regulations on service within the Reichswehr, he centralised the military ministries of the individual states, and he set up the structures of the Reichswehrministerium. He was also a central figure in the two major dramas of the period, the debate over the Versailles treaty and the Kapp Putsch. After resigning as Chef der Heeresleitung in March 1920 he became commander of Wehrkreis V in Stuttgart. In this capacity he exercised plenipotentiary powers in the state of emergency in 1923 and sent the Reichswehr into Thuringia, effectively overthrowing the KPD-SPD coalition. Before his death in 1930 he was involved in important national debates on military policy and he gave courses on military thought to young officers in the late 1920s. He had as varied a career as any of his peers, and he left an important legacy in terms of ideas and institutions. Even contemporaries who recognised his contribution to the establishment of the Reichswehr after 1918 acknowledged that he did not figure in the public’s pantheon of famous generals. In February 1934 General Werner von Fritsch, newly appointed Chef der Heeresleitung, recalled his predecessors, Generals Kurt von Hammerstein, Wilhelm Heye and Hans von Seeckt, names familiar to the public. He continued: ‘One name is missing, that of an exceptional man who was there at the beginning, of whose work the public does not know all that much, but whose imperishable service will always remain, the founder of the post-war German army: General Reinhardt.’3 In 1936, Reinhardt’s successor as commander of 5th Division, General Hahn wrote ‘that the contributions of General Reinhardt to the creation of the army are not even known, much less even acknowledged.’4 Georg Wetzell, the editor of Das Militärwochenblatt, agreed that while ‘within the army [his achievements] may be known’, his name had passed the public by.5 Reinhardt, in fact, was regarded by those who knew him as one of the central figures during the revolutionary period. Hermann Metz, who sat on the Preliminary Commission for the Peacetime Army (Vorkommission für das Friedensheer) which drew up the regulations on service for the Reichswehr, wrote after the Second World War: It fell to the then Minister of War, General Reinhardt, to lay the basis for the new army. He is the creator of the army, not General von Seeckt, as people now believe. The latter was its designer and trainer. Rabenau’s books on Seeckt have too much influence on the historiography of this period. Reinhardt gets too little attention. Reinhardt was not much liked by Seeckt, Groener or Loßberg, but he had great prestige within the officer corps.6 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nHStASt HStASt HStASt BA-MA\n\nM 660/034, Bü 54, newspaper cutting, dated 1 February 1934.

Moreover:\n\nCopyright © 2004. Berghahn Books, Incorporated.

With his decrees and regulations he hastened the collapse of the demobilized army; among other things he decreed the destruction of the imperial badges of rank and the political surveillance of the officers of the old army.\n\nIn the face of ‘persecution and treachery’ German nationalist groups had to set up volunteer units to fight further left-wing uprisings. It was these Freikorps groups which kept alive the spirit of national liberation from Jewish Bolshevism, while men like Reinhardt sacrificed principles in order to further their careers.11 Häußler’s condemnation of Reinhardt repeated many of the arguments that officers who refused to come to terms with the political reality of the Weimar Republic used against him in early 1919. In some respects it was a negative interpretation of Reinhardt as the general who supported the Republic. Within the context of military policy in the 1930s it was also a forlorn attempt to claim the military tradition for the Freikorps over the professional officer corps whom Hitler had flattered as ‘the second pillar of the state.’ 7.

Berghahn Books, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Modern German Army\n\nHahn was quick to counter Häußler’s view of Reinhardt. Reinhardt, he claimed, was not an opportunist but a realist who dealt effectively with a difficult situation after the war. Reinhardt had the ‘capacity for work and skill’ necessary for the task of demobilization which was his first post after the war. As Prussian Minister of War he ‘carried out the duties and tasks given to him in the [revolutionary] political environment, in order to rescue what was possible in the interests of the army. … His straightforward manner and his great expert knowledge gained him general respect.’ Hahn concluded that Reinhardt had laid the basis for Seeckt’s later work, and therefore he stood ‘at the beginning of the history of our young army.’12 However Hahn’s piece was not published by either Wehrfront or Das Militärwochenblatt. Instead the Commander of the Wehrmacht, Werner von Blomberg, who had been a close colleague of Reinhardt in Stuttgart in the first half of the 1920s, promised to write an article countering Häußler’s accusations. In 1942, on the seventieth anniversary of Reinhardt’s birth, one Colonel Scherff republished one of Reinhardt’s essays, ‘Führer- und Feldherrntum’. Scherff prefaced the article by claiming that Reinhardt’s views on leadership in war were ‘confirmed by today’s events and the military leadership personality of the Führer, Adolf Hitler.’13 Rather than betraying the German military tradition, Scherff argued that Reinhardt had preserved it until it could flourish in the Third Reich. Some on the left of the political spectrum might have agreed with this assessment of Reinhardt, although views were divided. In an early biography of Schleicher, two socialist writers, Kurt Caro and Walter Oehme, described Reinhardt as a ‘thoroughly loyal officer’ whose ‘heart belonged to the new state’.14 Reinhardt’s arguments in favour of resisting the military units involved in the Kapp Putsch consecrated his reputation as a loyal supporter of the Republic, and has continued to influence historical assessments of his character.15 But during the 1920s this reputation was undermined. Reinhardt played an important role in forcing the collapse of the Thuringian KPD-SPD coalition government in 1923, he attacked the DDP and SPD for their military policies, and a series of rumours linked him to right-wing paramilitary groups. In early September 1930, just weeks before the election, which saw the Nazis become the second largest party in the Reichstag, the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky lamented the generals’ lack of loyalty to the Republic, but he argued that it was not unsurprising since the case of Reinhardt had shown that loyalty 12.

He concluded that ‘in his anger [Reinhardt] went to the other side; he died as a convinced supporter of the radical right. That is how one demonstrates to the young lieutenant that loyalty does not pay. So one shows those with good will that they have no prospects.’16 After the war, Theodor Heuss, the first President of the Federal Republic, invoked Reinhardt as part of a positive German military tradition during a speech at the Führungsakademie in 1959. He had known Reinhardt in the late 1920s when they had both taught at the Hochschule für Politik, and Heuss admired his teaching style and his historical knowledge. However, he still felt that he had to explain Reinhardt’s rôle during the German revolution. In his view, Reinhardt became Prussian Minister of War ‘not because he was a revolutionary, but because there had to be somebody, who would risk his life and his reputation, who had courage and understanding.’17 This was similar to Hahn’s characterisation of Reinhardt as a selfless and pragmatic officer and patriot. On the other hand it shifted Reinhardt to a new liberal democratic context, instead of placing him in a tradition that led to Hitler’s Wehrmacht. In short contemporary politics have shaped Reinhardt’s historical reputation. In the two years before Heuss’s appearance at the Führungsakademie the Heidelberg historian, Fritz Ernst, had rescued Reinhardt from his almost total post-war oblivion. In 1957 he published an article-length biography, and the following year a collection of documents from Reinhardt’s Nachlaß.18 It is possible that these publications were intended as precursors to a full-scale biography of Reinhardt, but Ernst died in 1963. Based almost solely on papers in Reinhardt’s Nachlaß, the two pieces presented a heroic picture of a conservative officer who took up the reins of military policy at a critical moment. Ernst asked pointedly whether any of the officers in the Supreme Command who took Reinhardt to task for a variety of concessions to the new regime could have done any better.19 Reinhardt was naïve, compared to Groener who displayed a ‘mistrust’, and therefore could not understand ‘what Reinhardt really wanted and what the motives of his actions were.’20 Ernst accepted Reinhardt’s view that the post of Prussian Minster of War was a ‘crown of thorns’.21 In this preliminary work on Reinhardt, Ernst made two important points. First, he argued that Reinhardt was not ‘left-leaning’, as Groener and other critics in the officer corps asserted, but shared the conservative ethos of 16. Carl von Ossietzky.

Ernst’s argument presents a more balanced picture of the relationship between the Ministry of War and Supreme Command in 1919.23 When Ernst was writing his pieces on Reinhardt, the historiography of the Weimar Republic and the Reichswehr was still in its infancy, and it is worth reviewing the development of this historiography before outlining the argument of this book.24 The earliest historical writings on the Reichswehr focused on its loyalty, or lack of it, to the Republic to which it had pledged allegiance. After the Second World War the German army was discredited due to its association with the National Socialist regime. This, combined with the fact that the historiography on the Weimar Republic was primarily concerned with how Hitler came to power in January 1933,25 prompted historians to look at the rôle of the Reichswehr. In an influential study in 1955 by the American historian, Gordon Craig, the German army during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was portrayed as one of the most effective ‘opponents of constitutional reform, liberalism and democracy.’26 The introduction of parliamentary liberal democracy in 1918, he argued, made little difference to the position of the army in the ‘real constitution’, and by 1920 it was becoming a ‘state within a state.’27 It is significant that one of the earliest German historians of the Reichswehr, Wolfgang Sauer, also tended to see 1920, and the replacement of Reinhardt by Seeckt as Chef der Heeresleitung, as a significant turning point in Weimar’s civil-military relationship. He argued that the officer corps was broadly split into three groups – a monarchical one under General Walther von Lüttwitz, one willing to accept the new state, represented by Wilhelm Groener and Reinhardt, and one under Seeckt, which followed a policy of attentisme, of preserving the army intact until a more “positive” political situation came about. The Kapp Putsch brought the Seeckt group to the fore, and since he moulded Reichswehr policy, this non-committal attitude towards the republic prevailed.28 22. Ibid., 359–60. 23. Ibid., passim. 24.

Francis Carsten, in the only overview of the Reichswehr’s history to date, argued that ‘The officer corps was bound to consider the revolution and its consequences as an attack upon itself and its whole world. It could only react to the revolution and the new order with strong opposition. That the officers, in spite of this, put themselves at the disposal of the new government was an event which had far-reaching consequences.’30 Both Eberhard Kolb and Ulrich Kluge, in their monographs on the workers’ and soldiers’ councils movement, argued that the SPD-led Council of People’s Commissars, which replaced the imperial regime until the election of the National Assembly, failed to rid Germany of the imperial élites. Kluge concluded that already in early 1919: Germany had a military system, whose leaders had sworn formal loyalty to the new order, but were far from ready to defend the substance of this order. The influence which the army re-established shortly after 9 November 1918 was too great to be accommodated by the republican constitution. The one chance to create a military system in Germany, which corresponded to the demands for inner consolidation and the intentions of wide sectors of the population, had been missed.31\n\nCopyright © 2004.

This idea of the Reichswehr as a pillar of the German state was not just popular with interwar writers in Germany, but also found favour with the first historian of the Reichswehr, and subsequent Vichyite, Jean Bénoist-Méchin:\n\nCopyright © 2004. Berghahn Books, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nIt was [the army] which prevented Germany from collapse and helped overcome a succession of crises. It eliminated little by little all the men whom it judged were damaging to the nation. Invisible but active, in the shadows in periods of détente, but always intervening at the critical moment, the Reichswehr never ceased to arbitrate the situation. It was the cover, thrown over the crevasse that linked the Second to the Third Reich.\n\nBénoist-Méchin identified three factors which allowed the Reichswehr to exercise influence in German politics and society. First, the Reichswehr was a relatively homogenous group in a deeply divided society. Second, generals spent long periods in office, compared to the swift change of governments. Finally the Reichswehr was certain of its political goals when other groups were uncertain of theirs.35 One of the interesting characteristics of Bénoist-Méchin’s thesis is that he praised the Reichswehr’s record for the very reasons for which post-Second World War historians lamented its rôle in the Weimar republic, such as its political influence and as an element of continuity between the Kaiser and Hitler. However the positive contribution of the Reichswehr to the Weimar republic has been noted by a number of historians, who either avoid seeing 1933 as a logical culmination of the republic’s history, or else argue that the officer corps, and, in particular, Schleicher, offered the last hurdle to Hitler’s Machtergreifung. Heinz Hürten argues that ‘[I]f a teleological view of German history with 1933 as its endpoint is avoided, then the policy of co-operation between the Council of the People’s Commissars, its successor governments and the military, cannot be simply regarded as an early step towards ruin, but must be interpreted as successful.’36 In defence of the Reichswehr he suggests that political realities are not based upon laws, as socialist and liberal critics of militarism might suggest, but upon force. The Reichswehr was the guarantor of the 34. Detlef Bald, Der deutsche Offizier. Sozial- und Bildungsgeschichte des deutschen Offizierkorps im 20. Jahrhundert, Munich, 1982, 14–15, 22–23. 35.

Cooperation was sustained by a basic consensus on the need for the reestablishment of order, German unity and defence against Bolshevism.38 Harold Gordon, a former officer in the American army, also defended the record of the Reichswehr. He inverted the question of responsibility, and argued that the government was in fact a hindrance to the ‘law and order’ policies of the army.39 Government vacillation, the treaty of Versailles, and the impending dissolution of Freikorps units damaged the morale of the Reichswehr. The Kapp Putsch is presented as a revolt of the ‘disinherited’, and he suggestively writes that the disenchanted Freikorps soldiers were ‘raw material to be moulded by bold and daring revolutionaries.’40 Both Hürten’s and Gordon’s work stress the rôle of the Reichswehr as the ultima ratio of the state, and that this rôle was underpinned by its monopoly of ‘legitimate force’. Recently, this line of argument has been applied to the rôle of the Reichswehr leadership in the crisis of the early 1930s. As the major power factor in Germany, the Reichswehr had the potential to decide the outcome of events. Eberhard Kolb and Wolfram Pyta concluded that ‘a presidential dictatorship supported by the Reichswehr’ offered the best chance for the Weimar Republic to overcome the crisis, and to return later to a parliamentary system of government.41 Whereas viewing the history of the Reichswehr through the lens of the National Socialist regime led to the castigation of the political activities of the officer corps by Carsten, Wette and others, Pyta presents Schleicher and his allies in the Reichswehrministerium as the last barrier to Hitler’s Machtergreifung.42 Beyond the question of whether the officer corps supported or destabilized the Weimar republic, lies the matrix of rearmament, foreign policy, domestic political stability and the nature of modern industrial warfare. It is from this perspective that the most fruitful insights into civil-military relations have emerged. For example, Pyta argues that Schleicher measured 37.

The conduct of war can no longer be limited to the military instrument, as is the traditional view of absolutist and liberal thought but becomes part of national defence, which encompasses the whole of society.’46 The strict division of the civil and military sphere collapsed with the onset of modern industrial warfare. Geyer drew on theorists such as Morris Janowitz and Samuel Huntington, while Ernst Willi Hansen, who wrote about the relations between the Reichswehr and industry, used various models of the ‘military-industrial complex’.47 At the root of the debate on the Reichswehr’s reaction to future war lie three questions: what would characterise the war of the future, how did the officer corps prepare for it, and how did the spectre of it impact upon the civil-military relationship in the Weimar years?48 Of course, at the centre of this debate stood the experience of the First World War, which did much to shape the expectations of the next war.49 Recent research has suggested that 43.

Chickering and Förster comment: ‘“Total war” became a popular topos during the period between the two world wars of the twentieth century. It was coined during the first of them, and it subsequently played an important role in deliberations everywhere about the future of war.’51 This does not necessarily mean that soldiers wanted total war. As Markus Pöhlmann, who has examined the German military journals of the interwar period, writes: ‘“To avoid or to prepare [for total war]?” – the central metadiscourse of the German military élite in the interwar period can be framed in this formula.’52 There was no escape from the next war, which German soldiers assumed was inevitable.53 The major divisions within the German officer corps concerned the nature of the war. For many historians it has made more sense to classify the Weimar officer corps on the basis of their theories of war, rather than on their attitude to the Republic.54 Thus Wilhelm Deist argues that the group around Colonel Joachim von Stülpnagel, who advocated a theory of Volkskrieg, or the participation of the whole populace in some war-related activity, ‘was not held together by a single political conviction or strategy, but by the common goal of maintaining and increasing the military efficiency of the Reichswehr.’55 Stülpnagel’s ideas had superseded those of Seeckt, who had stressed the viability of a small army, in the wake of the Reichswehr’s inability to resist the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923.56 Yet the Volkskrieg theory was replaced by a complex new security policy, drafted by Wilhelm Groener after he became Reichswehrminister in 1928. The dispute between the political officers headed by Schleicher and Groener, and the militarist officers, led by General Werner von Blomberg, previously Reinhardt’s chief of staff in Wehrkreis V, has been well-documented.57 Groener set clear guidelines for the use of the Reichswehr that recognised the weaknesses of the 100,000 men army. He accepted the primacy of political control over the military forces of the state. Johannes Hürter, author of a monograph on Groener as Reichswehrminister, concluded that ‘Groener’s sense of reality and his conceptual 50.

Hitler appointed Blomberg as Reichswehrminister, and he reversed Groener’s gradualist approach. Pragmatism was cast aside, and a dynamic but ultimately flawed rearmament plan was pursued in order to prepare Germany for the next war.59 In general, historians have identified four different responses to the challenge of future war in the Weimar era: Seeckt’s small but highly trained and mobile force60, Stülpnagel’s Volkskrieg theory, Groener’s realistic concept of German security, and Blomberg’s dynamic rearmament programme. Historians have also identified these different approaches to the question of war with different attitudes towards the republic. Corum argues that ‘von Seeckt’s decision to retain a disproportionately high percentage of General Staff affairs was right for the army and nation. It was less democratic than Reinhardt’s vision, but von Seeckt was correct in recognising the organisational and technical abilities of the General Staff as having first priority.’61 Groener accepted the primacy of political control, not out of a liberal conviction about civil-military relations, but because it served his purpose. Under Groener the Reichswehr began the process of ‘moving into the executive’, of acknowledging the political framework within which military policy had to be formulated and seeking to utilise that framework for its own ends.62 Like Groener, both Stülpnagel and Blomberg sought to bring the Reichswehr closer to the state and society. Yet their more radical views on modern warfare had different consequences. Geyer argues that in the 1920s the Reichswehr ‘set out to organise society for the purpose of war according to its efficiencyoriented maxims in a national scheme for converting civil into military society in case of war. This made the Reichswehr into an exceedingly dangerous organisation.’ The military mission of the Reichswehr, which ultimately aimed at the revision of the treaty of Versailles, led it to destabilize both internal and external politics.63 It is within the context of the primacy of foreign policy and the changing relationship between war, the state, and society that Reinhardt must 58.

Like all officers he saw Germany’s main goal after the war as the restoration of Germany as a Great Power. This was only possible with the use or threat of military force. He shared the pessimistic belief that international relations could not be regulated by laws, customs or institutions like the League of Nations. Ultimately each state had to protect itself with military force from the predatory designs of its neighbours.65 The rapid establishment of a reliable military force in early 1919 was essential to the continued existence of Germany. It was not just the Weimar Republic that faced internal unrest, it was also Germany that faced the threat of Polish and Bolshevist invasion and Allied occupation. Only military force, in his view, could prevent the worst consequences of defeat. If this was a common, and indeed necessary belief, for a professional officer, Reinhardt’s view of the future of warfare made him one of the most radical militarists of the interwar period. Reinhardt, drawing on the experience of the First World War, believed that societies, and not simply armies, waged war.66 The militarization of society had to be total, down to the use of women at the fighting front, and old men on the home front. His views were presented in a rational and logical manner, but there is no doubt about the radical nature of what he proposed. The institutions of the state were assessed on their ability to function in war, and society was to be militarized in peacetime. Even in 1919 the rationalisation of the Kaiserreich’s military institutions was implemented with one eye firmly on the conduct of a future war. The military and national interests were conflated. This marked him out from Seeckt, who advocated a professional army, instead of the Millionenheeren of the pre-war period, and Groener, who subordinated the military agenda to the broader interests of national security. Reinhardt’s advocacy of the militarization of German society led him to a peculiarly inclusive vision of the Volksgemeinschaft or national community.67 The creation of a Volksgemeinschaft was a central issue in Weimar politics, and there were a variety of competing visions, based on different principles. Reinhardt’s aim was to maximize German military 64.

On the other hand, pacifists and internationalists (including communists) were excluded from this community, the latter because they rejected the principle of the nation-state. If the army was the representative of military values within society then it could not afford to alienate or exclude any social groups from its ranks. It was this principle which led Reinhardt to promote the recruitment of workingclass soldiers, and most notably to oppose the Kapp Putsch because it would damage the Reichswehr’s image with republicans. This inclusive vision marked a departure from the conservative military thought of the Kaiserreich era when working-class recruits were distrusted as SPD supporters.68 If the primacy of foreign policy informed Reinhardt’s principles, then the implementation of those ideas was dependent on the political constellations of the day – within the officer corps, within the government, and within Weimar Germany’s society. Between November 1918 and March 1920 there was a bitter dispute between the Ministry of War and the Supreme Command (and the General Staff, after the latter’s dissolution). This was in many respects the inevitable consequence of having two major bureaucracies dealing with military policy. During the Kaiserreich era the relationship between the Ministry and the General Staff had been fraught as they clashed over military budgets and recruitment policy.69 After the war it became clear that there would be a restructuring of military institutions, and the struggle began to dominate the Reichswehrministerium. Proposals and counter-proposals were heavily influenced by bureaucratic self-interest. The sense of conflict was sharpened by the personal rivalry between Reinhardt, the Minister for War, and Groener, the leading officer of the Supreme Command. While Groener has rightly been seen as a politically astute character, Reinhardt was not naïve, and in the personal and bureaucratic rivalry it appeared as though he had triumphed against Groener and then Seeckt until the Kapp Putsch led to Reinhardt’s fall and Seeckt’s succession. Reinhardt’s power in 1919 was mainly due to his strong relationship with Ebert and Noske. Within the officer corps Reinhardt was a weak figure, who only enjoyed the support of his closest advisers. He was unable to exert his authority over more recalcitrant and even rebellious elements. Therefore his relationship with the cabinet was fundamental to his achievements in 1919. They trusted his professional expertise, and with their political support he was able to outmanouevre his rivals within the officer corps, as well as reform the military administration and 68.

Whereas Seeckt’s tenure as Chef der Heeresleitung ended due to his deteriorating relationship with Otto Gessler, the Reichswehrminister, it is notable that Reinhardt resigned because of a Putsch from within the officer corps. This was a massive blow to the principle of civilian control of the military, although whether Reinhardt would have co-operated with the Republic in the longer term was dependent on whether it would enable the restoration of German military power. There were other political factors which Reinhardt had to take into account. Military policy was not formulated in isolation from the rest of German politics, and Reinhardt had to compete for scarce resources. The composition of the National Assembly enabled Reinhardt to push through his programme of centralising the states’ war ministries. However Reinhardt was less successful at promoting the military agenda in the discussions about the treaty of Versailles. Military defeat meant that German foreign policy was reliant upon business and financial weight, rather than military power.70 The government was less willing to ‘go to the wall’ for concessions on military aspects of the treaty than it was to retain threatened territories. The Reich Finance Ministry was unhappy at the amount of money it spent on the army, and tried to force Reinhardt to speed up the pace of demobilization. The constellation of political power within which Reinhardt operated in 1919 offered opportunities and risks. The revolution meant that the structures of the state would be changed, but in early 1919 it was not clear what changes these forms would take. What Reinhardt had to do, was to make sure these changes favoured the military as much as was possible. To that extent he was a supreme pragmatist. While his actions in 1919 showed the possibilities for co-operation between the Republic and the officer corps, there were clear limits. The primacy of foreign policy prescribed two aims in Weimar Germany. First, the Reich had to be preserved. The survival of Germany as a potential actor in the continental struggle for supremacy was the first test for the Republic. The officer corps had to co-operate with the Republic to ensure this. Open conflict between the Republic and the army would have led to civil war and the collapse of Germany. By the end of 1923 the test of survival had been passed. But Reinhardt’s ultimate goal was the restoration of German military power and the reversal of the outcome of the First World War. Could such an expansionary policy be achieved within the context of the Republic?71 This remains an open counterfactual question, precluded by the dynamic assertion of German power by the Nazis. It can be considered at the levels of foreign and domestic policy. By the time of Reinhardt’s death, in September 1930, Stresemann’s co-operative 70.

Against that Germany stood isolated, having failed embarrassingly to forge a Customs Union with Austria and alienated French good will through its unilateralist approach. Nonetheless Stresemann’s multilateral approach was unlikely to allay French nervousness about German rearmament, so from the perspective of military policy, the approach of the early 1930s, combined with the secret programme of rearmament, showed the opportunities for an assertive Germany. The quiet support for rearmament by the SPD cabinet members was a startling contrast to the official military policy of the party, which focused on disarmament, arbitration and institutional guarantees of the international order. The domestic political balance of power, despite the pessimism of officers in the early 1930s, had clearly shifted to the right and support for military values. Yet there was no way in which the governments of the early 1930s had sufficient power to implement the militarization of society on the scale desired by Reinhardt. When he died in 1930, Reinhardt was definitely less enamoured with the Republic than he had been in 1919, but he still did not oppose it. A biography of Reinhardt is an account of civil-military relations in the Weimar Republic, and thus it goes to the heart of one of the most important issues of Weimar historiography. Reinhardt, even more so than Groener in 1919, realised the opportunities provided by the Republic. Yet not only was he a pragmatist, but he was also a radical militarist, with an almost utopian vision of a militarised national community. Like all military planners, he was future-orientated. This was not simply a matter of rational professionalism, but also of messianic hope in Germany’s future as a Great Power. His relationship with the Republic depended on the potential for the fulfilment of this mission. Reinhardt, both a pragmatist and a radical militarist, stood simultaneously at opposite ends of the spectrum of the officer corps. For example, Stülpnagel was a radical militarist, opposed to the Republic from a very early stage; Groener accepted the subordinate place of military power in national strategy and generally supported the Republic. Reinhardt embodied the tension of these positions, and tried to resolve it by pushing for a militarized state and society within the framework of the Republic, if possible, but outside it, if necessary. This study is based on a wide range of primary source material, some of which has already been published. If Ernst’s collection was the most obvious source for this study, then the collections in the series Quellen zur Geschichte des Parlamentarismus and Akten der Reichskanzlei have also been invaluable. There are also a number of published diaries, most notably those of Colonel Albrecht von Thaer, an officer in the OHL –\n\n16 –\n\nThe Creation of the Modern German Army : General Walther Reinhardt and the Weimar Republic, 1914-1930, Berghahn Books,\n\nIntroduction\n\nCopyright © 2004.

The Nachlaß was held by Reinhardt’s daughter, Lotte, a teacher in Stuttgart, after her father’s death in August 1930. On 7 September 1939 she gave some papers to the Heeresarchiv in Stuttgart.76 A year later an archivist wrote to her: ‘Noticeably little is available on service and personal presentations, which would have been made during the war.’77 Lotte Reinhardt gave the archive some more material, mainly press cuttings and photos.78 It is probable that she retained some of her father’s papers, because Ernst, who had contacted her, was able to publish extracts from letters between Reinhardt and his wife, Luise, which dealt with Reinhardt’s views of the end of the First World War. However these letters are not in the Nachlaß, and so an important source of information for Reinhardt’s personal views has been lost. Ernst also believed that the letters for the whole of 1919 were lost. This is unfortunate because one must assume that the correspondence between them was copious. Reinhardt had spent four years at war, and then on his return spent much of his time in either Berlin or Weimar, while the family home was in Stuttgart.79 72. General Major a. D. Albrecht von Thaer.

On several occasions he was asked to write a major work. When Reinhardt was promoted to commander of Reichswehrgruppe II in December 1924, Dr Otto Berger of Bergers Literärisches Büro, took the opportunity, not only to send him a letter of congratulations, but also to inquire whether he was interested in publishing his memoirs, with particular reference to the period 1918 to 1920.80 Three years later Berger renewed the offer, and reminded Reinhardt that the firm was also publishing the memoirs of such eminent people as Wilhelm Blos, the former state president of Württemberg.81 Verlag Deutsche Wille also expressed an interest in publishing Reinhardt’s account of his time as Prussian Kriegsminister as part of a collection.82 However the persistent attempts of publishers to get Reinhardt to put pen to paper failed. Nonetheless, after his death, his elder brother Ernst was concerned to rescue his sibling from obscurity. He edited a series of lectures which Reinhardt had given in 1928 and 1929, and published them with Ernst Mittler und Sohn.83 Ernst Reinhardt had also contacted many of his brother’s former colleagues, and used their most eloquent tributes in the biographical sketch at the beginning of the book.84 Together the Nachlaß and Ernst Reinhardt’s edition of his brother’s lectures constitute the core sources for any study of Walther Reinhardt. However the Findbuch (catalogue) also contains a word of warning from Major General Sieglin for the biographer: ‘The papers cannot give a complete picture of this soldier, who in the first place was a man of action and decision, and made much more of an impact with the spoken than with the written word.’85 The normal difficulties of evaluating sources is compounded for the student of German military history due to the bombing of the army ministry building in April 1945. While some material which was believed to have been destroyed in the bombing has been discovered in archives in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, much material has been lost permanently.86 To supplement the material in Reinhardt’s Nachlaß this study has drawn on material from a wide variety of archives.

The federal archives in Koblenz and Berlin also yielded a significant amount of material, including a set of files on the development of the crisis in 1923 in Thuringia, where Reinhardt had plenipotentiary executive powers during the state of emergency.87 The political archive of the Foreign Office, Bonn, provided material on Reinhardt’s role in formulating foreign policy in 1919. The documents in Reinhardt’s Nachlaß give the impression that he was only involved in foreign affairs in May and June 1919, when the debate over the treaty of Versailles was at its height. The Foreign Office files demonstrate that he also cast an eye towards events in eastern Europe, and was negotiating with the German-Austrians about the implications of an Anschluß for military policy. The loss of files in April 1945 has been ameliorated to a certain extent by the federal structure of the German state which meant that the Prussian Kriegsministerium often sent out directives to other military ministries in Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg and Baden. Together with the reports of envoys from these states, these documents reveal hitherto obscure policy debates within the Prussian Kriegsministerium. For example the Reichswehr committee, set up in early 1919 to formulate policy for the new army, has often been passed over in the literature, despite its important role. Files from the Hauptstaatsarchiv, Stuttgart and the Generallandesarchiv, Karlsruhe, contain reports on important meetings that underline the important rôle the Prussian Ministry of War, and by extension Reinhardt, played in establishing the new army. Other files found in the state archives in Munich, Stuttgart and Karlsruhe illuminated issues such as the centralisation of the war ministries in October 1919, the establishment of the Reichswehrministerium and the development of local civil-military relations in Wehrkreis V during the 1920s, issues which have received only cursory attention from historians.88 Finally, the Prussian cabinet minutes, held at the Geheimes Staatsarchiv, Dahlem, proved a useful source since Reinhardt was a Prussian minister until late September 1919. 87. Most of the historiography on 1923 has been devoted to the crises in Saxony and Bavaria, and there is no monograph on Thüringia, although there is a study on socialist policies in that state between 1918 and 1923, Beate Häupel, Die Gründung des Landes Thüringens.

The family background was one of service to the Württemberg state which had became part of the German Reich in 1871. His father fought in the wars of German unification, his paternal grandfather had been a municipal administrator and his maternal grandfather a professor of forestry at the university of Tübingen.1 Just before Reinhardt’s birth his father had been promoted to the general staff of the newly created 27th (2nd Royal Württemberg) Division in Ulm, an indication that the family had a steady position in Württemberg life. Reinhardt’s own identity acknowledged his Württemberg roots, but was dominated by the new Reich. His own description of his father as a ‘Württemberger, faithful to the Heimat, who developed into a convinced Reich-German’, could equally describe his own affinities.2 The Reich which Bismarck had founded and for which millions had fought and died in the First World War had primacy in his identity.3 To that extent Reinhardt reflected the experience of somebody born in the Gründerzeit generation. His close identification with the Reich was coupled with a deep admiration, bordering on veneration, for Prussia and her achievements, particularly in the military sphere. In 1885 he entered the cadet school at Oranienstein, apparently with the grudging approval of his father who was wary of choosing a career at such an 1.

In the frugal lifestyle of the cadets, he saw the virtues which had led Prussia to unify Germany.5 One of his duties as Chef der Heeresleitung (head of army command) was to speak at the closure of the Berlin Cadet School in March 1920: ‘the spirit of the cadet corps was the spirit of the army. Its aim was the formation of a sprightly race, healthy in body and mind, trusting in God, faithful, comradely and honourable and above all, enthusiastic, because without enthusiasm nothing great can be achieved.’6 Reinhardt saw these characteristics, embodied in the Prussian and then the German army, as the motor of German history. Belief in the historical mission of Prussia, as creator and protector of Germany, and his own experience of the Prussian military, promoted the development of a close identification with the new Reich.7 It was as a German, rather than as a Württemberger, that Reinhardt imagined himself. Reinhardt spent much of his early career between Württemberg and Berlin. After completing his basic military education in Berlin, Reinhardt entered the prestigious Olga Regiment in Württemberg, as Portepée-Fähnrich (cadet officer) on 9 February 1891. He was soon back in the classroom, this time at the new war school at Hersfeld. The aim of the war school was to educate the best cadets to a higher level. This course continued until the autumn when he took an officers’ examintion, in which he showed ‘exceptional knowledge’.8 Reinhardt advanced his career through merit, rather than connections or background, and can be seen as one of the emerging type of bourgeois officer, like his fellow Württemberger, Wilhelm Groener, or Erich Ludendorff, later Quartermaster General and the most influential officer during the last two years of the war.9 He returned to Olga Regiment and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, with a patent dated 8 February 1891. There are indications that he had many interests outside of military affairs. For example, he met Albrecht von Thaer, later an officer with the Supreme Command, at the War Academy in Berlin. After Reinhardt’s death Thaer wrote to Ernst Reinhardt, ‘I often came into contact with your brother. The friendship 4. Wehrkraft und Wehrwille, 2; John Moncure, Forging the King’s Sword.

We discussed (and corresponded on) many questions that lay close to our hearts, not only military or political questions, but ones about humanity, also religious ones.’10 During a stay in Berlin at the Militär-Turn-Anstalt in 1895 and 1896 he met Luise Fürbringer, daughter of Professor Paul Fürbringer, one of the leading doctors at Friedrichshain hospital in Berlin. On 7 April 1900 the couple married. The marriage was a happy one, and they had three daughters, Lotte, Hedwig and Ursula.11 The choice of marriage partner is significant. First, the Fürbringer family were of Jewish extraction, and Reinhardt would have needed the permission of his superior officer to marry her.12 Later Reinhardt won a reputation as one of the few philosemitic officers in the German army and this is an early indication of the courage with which he opposed the prevalent anti-Semitic prejudice amongst the German officer corps.13 Second, Luise Fürbringer came from a Bildungsbürgertum (professional-middle class) background and this is another demonstration of the fact that Reinhardt was at ease in a wide range of social company. It could be argued that they represented an emerging and self-confident professional class.14 Not only do Reinhardt’s social connections indicate that he was at ease with the world outside the officers’ mess, but his political views also indicate some divergence from the stereotypical officer.15 There are indications that Groener’s antagonism to Reinhardt, which came to the fore in 1919, dated from their days in the Württemberg army, when Groener formed the erroneous impression that Reinhardt was a ‘leftist’.16 10.\n\nCopyright © 2004.

The reports come from Die Tägliche Rundschau, and were factual in nature; Reinhardt was probably interested in the debate on military policy.18 In 1890 William II had instructed that bourgeois officers with an aristocratic mentality were to be recruited to fill the swelling ranks.19 Reinhardt’s interest in SPD policy hardly conformed to type. It is uncertain whether anyone knew Reinhardt was reading reports on SPD conferences, but it is worth noting that his rather leftist reputation did not damage his prospects of promotion. Apart from a collection of articles on matters of military interest, his allegiance to the monarchy is evident from the collection of articles on the accession and death of Frederick III, the untested model of a liberal monarch.20 In 1901 Reinhardt was seconded to the Great General Staff for a twoyear stint in the French department. His then immediate superior, General von Kuhl noted, as others would later, that despite ‘his unusual capability for work, he always remained fresh and cheerful.’21 Reinhardt spent a considerable amount of time both in France and studying the French army from this point onwards. In the summer of 1903 he visited France for three months.22 By 1917 it is clear that Reinhardt had developed a deep antipathy to the French, but it is impossible to say whether this antipathy had existed before the war. From his collection of newspaper cuttings it is evident that Reinhardt took a general interest in French affairs.23 Hence before the outbreak of the war Reinhardt had established himself amongst the élite of the German officer corps. At the end of 1912 Reinhardt was asked to organise a course in military affairs for Crown Prince Philipp Albrecht, son of the Catholic Archduke Albrecht, heir to the Württemberg throne.24 While the course covered the standard topics of military 17.

He stressed that the ‘soldiering profession, conceived as a life-long task, claims the whole man.’ He pointed to the organisational and leadership qualities which were necessary, and argued that it was an ideal preparation for those who sought to move into positions of leadership, in a typical association of political and military leadership skills. His list of models included Moltke, Blücher, William I and Francis Joseph, but not William II. The introduction suggested the confidence of an officer in late Wilhelmine Germany, who saw the soldiering profession as the most worthy pursuit. On the other hand his interest in SPD military policy and his philosemitic attitude must have brought to his attention the fissures in German society.25 It is doubtful however that Reinhardt would have risen to prominence without the onset of war, and indeed the defeat and the departure of a generation of German generals. The war undoubtedly accelerated his career. There is no contemporary evidence to reveal his reactions to the outbreak of war in August 1914, and utterances after the war may have been distorted by memory and political necessity. The image of civil peace, or the Burgfrieden, which purported to end the era of social and political division within Germany between the classes, and concentrate energy on the external foe, was a central motif during the war years and then in the Weimar Republic. It represented an idealised view of German society.26 In a lecture in the late 1920s he remarked: ‘The loss of the individual’s military capability was often talked about, particularly before the war. The war brought a pleasant surprise. The generation of 1914 proved itself well.’27 Certainly before the war there was a current in German thought that was critical of the materialism of Wilhelmine society, and it was feared that this would affect the quality of the ordinary soldier. In this context Reinhardt’s image of 1914 and the Burgfrieden was standard fare in military circles in Weimar Germany. Like many other Germans he saw the war as defensive. In a draft official history of the Württemberg army, written while Reinhardt was commander of Wehrkreis V, France was portrayed as the aggressor. From 1904 (possibly a reference to the Anglo-French Entente) and the first Moroccan crisis to the introduction of a three year military service law in 1913, Germany had been suspicious of French intentions, according to Reinhardt.28 The alleged threat to Germany, presumably due to the sense 25.

We tried this in 1914.’29 Unlike many other generals and politicians, who either tried to portray Russia as the aggressor, or Britain as the main enemy, Reinhardt laid both charges at the feet of the French. Reinhardt’s willingness after the war to publish German records to repudiate war guilt charges can be seen as further evidence that he believed that Germany was fighting a defensive war.30 Reinhardt spent the whole war on the fighting front, and mostly on the western front. This experience was different from that of his two major rivals after the war, Wilhelm Groener, who had to grapple with labour issues and the war economy at the War Office, and Hans von Seeckt, who spent most of the war on the Eastern front, where the fronts could shift rapidly. At the start of the war Reinhardt was serving in the General Staff of 13th Army Corps, part of 5th Army. The Chief of Staff, Fritz von Loßberg, had been given three weeks leave on 20 July, and was only warned in the early afternoon of 30 July of a ‘imminent danger of war’.31 On 8 August the trains rolled out of Stuttgart, and in Reinhardt’s words ‘now, what had been planned for over forty years for the defence of the Fatherland, would come to be realised.’32 This was a further indication of the sense of encirclement, engendered by Germany’s geopolitical position between France and Russia. Efficient mobilisation was the first pre-condition of the success of the risky Schlieffen plan which left little room for delay or the frictions of warfare.33 Loßberg’s memory of the march into France was that while the Luxembourgeois were friendly to the Germans, German troops were fired upon by French civilians, whom, he admits, were executed.34 On 22 August 13th Army Corps encountered the French 5th Army Corps, whose morale Reinhardt described as good. Throughout the war he emphasised the risk of underestimating the French, who, as he pointed out, were defending their homeland. However the Württemberg forces pushed them back: ‘impact, artillery battle, the succumbing of the French, their retreat, our pursuit, the clear work of a glorious day.’35 Reinhardt made neither reference to franc-tireurs nor to the atrocities committed by soldiers of 13th Army Corps.36 29.

After the war the Schlieffen plan became the subject of debate.37 Reinhardt accepted the principle that if one took the offensive then it was necessary to attack the core (Lebenszentren) of the enemy state. However while he recognised that the Schlieffen doctrine of envelopment had worked at Tannenberg in Eastern Prussia in September 1914 when Hindenburg and Ludendorff had surrounded and defeated a larger Russian force, he concluded that ‘enough ink has flowed [on the Schlieffen plan], in which the question of the march through Belgium plays no small role.’ Less tentatively he regretted that ‘we missed the co-operation of the statesman and the army leader, which is already necessary at the stage of the war plan.’38 Yet he did not offer any alternatives to the Schlieffen plan, unless his comments that it was easier to fight in one’s homeland than on enemy soil, can be taken to mean that Germany should have adopted a defensive, long-war strategy in 1914. Instead Reinhardt would immerse himself in the tactical demands of the war of position. This manner of thinking led to a war of attrition.39 By 8 September 13th Army Corps had been held up. Five days later it retreated for the first time, marking the beginning of Reinhardt’s experience of the Stellungskrieg: ‘in short the onset of the Stellungskrieg changed the face of service in the General Command – now there was permanent equipment in the offices, a growth of written work, an increasing need for technical and artillery material, and better personal care, offset by work late into the night.’40 Stellungskrieg became a central point of post-war debate about military doctrine as military planners sought to restore decisiveness to operations.41 Reinhardt did not endorse it; nor did he offer as radical an alternative as Seeckt’s doctrine of mobile warfare. For Reinhardt the war of attrition demonstrated that Germany had not maximized its resources. He pointed to French levels of recruitment which were far higher than German ones before 1914. The reliance on the superiority of German troops had been an error. While they proved themselves in the early battles, he also noted that ‘it was not sufficient.’42 According to Reinhardt’s 37.

The First World War did not lead him to conclude that mass armies were flawed military instruments, but rather to call for even more mobilization. To this extent his argument is similar to Ludendorff’s, which claimed that it was the failure to mobilize sufficiently which led to German defeat. If Seeckt inclined towards limited warfare, Reinhardt looked towards total warfare. At the end of November, 13th Army Corps was transferred to the Eastern front to form part of the left wing of 9th Army at the Bzura. Once again Reinhardt experienced Stellungskrieg. By the autumn of 1915, 13th Army Corps was back in the west and Reinhardt had been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. His time in the east made a deep impression on him. After the war he articulated the stereotype that the inhabitants east of the Elbe made the best soldiers, and that this part of Germany was the ‘mother soil’ for the German people.43 Yet for Reinhardt, France remained the Erbfeind, the hereditary enemy of Germany. For his final posting of the war, Reinhardt became the Chief of Staff of 7th Army, headed by General von Boehn, in February 1917. He believed that German resources should be concentrated against France, rather than against the British and Imperial forces. Whereas France and Germany were locked in an existential struggle, the British did not face a similar calamity. It was after a successful defensive battle in the spring of 1917 that Reinhardt appeared to come to this conclusion.44 He picked up an article, from the newspaper of 7th Army, which pointed out that without British help, the French would have lost the war.45 The political logic of the Anglo-French alliance escaped Reinhardt who considered the impact of an attack on French morale, morale being a highly important element of military strength.46 After the war, in a rather distorted view of the events of 1918, Reinhardt wrote: The spring offensive of 1918 was mainly directed at the English whom we liked to see as the main enemy. … The question of whether equal losses would inflict the same moral impression on the French and the English was, in my view, hardly considered at the time. However it is certain that a far smaller part of the English people’s strength (Volkskraft) was fighting in France, than that of the French. In my opinion only the latter could have been defeated.47 43.

Although there was a recognition that materiel was essential, the stress on morale led Reinhardt to call for the spiritual militarization of the individual. The struggle between nations was not reduced to the respective strengths of their economies, but became a conflict between cultures. The onset of modern industrialized warfare had meant that the issue of morale became transplanted from the army to the whole nation.48 1917 was the year of the defensive on the western front, and the performance of 7th Army earned Reinhardt the decoration of Pour le mérite. He became known as ‘the defensive lion of Laon.’49 The following year, the German Supreme Command, dominated by Ludendorff, decided to go on the offensive, before the arrival of American troops swung the war in the Allies’ favour.50 Although 7th Army pushed the French back over the river Marne in May 1918, the German lines were overstretched. On 15 July, 7th Army began to attack once more, but its forces were too weak. On 18 July, the French commander of the Allied forces, Ferdinand Foch launched a carefully prepared counter-attack against 7th Army. The use of tanks, which emerged from the woods around Villers-Cotterets, surprised the German forces. Although Ludendorff later commented that the defeat at the hands of British forces on 2 August was the ‘blackest day’ in German history, the defeat of 7th Army marked the end of the series of German offensives.51 The initiative now lay with the Allies. Occasionally, after the war, opponents of Reinhardt associated him with the defeat of 7th Army, and indeed a number of myths were deployed to apportion or to deflect blame. The retreat of 7th Army was portrayed as a successful defensive battle, but the account given by Loßberg, the liaison officer from the German Supreme Command to 7t"
