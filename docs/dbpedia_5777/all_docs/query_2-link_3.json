        "text": "FO 30/239: Robert B. D. Morier to Earl Granville, MostConfidential, No 3, Darmstadt, 18 March 1871\n\n[Received 20 March by Messenger Biehl. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate / G[ranville]]\n\nConversation with Prince Alexander of Hesse respecting rumoured treaty between Russia and Prussia in June 1870\n\nI took occasion of a visit paid to me the other day by Baron Dalwigk to ask him whether at the time of the Emperor of Russia's visit to the King of Prussia at Ems in the latter days of May and the beginning of June last year, he had heard any thing of the Treaty which it was now currently reported had been concluded between Prussia & Russia on that occasion.Footnote 1 His Excellency assured me that he had never then or since heard any thing which could lead him to believe that a treaty such as that suggested had on that occasion been concluded, and though he did not doubt that from an early date a clear understanding had been arrived at between the two Governments by which Prussia was assured not only of Russia's neutrality but of her assistance in the event of Austria's joining with France he did not believe that this understanding had been recorded in so formal an instrument as a treaty.\n\nI had occasion the next day to see Prince Alexander of Hesse who, as Your Lordship is aware, is the favorite brother of the Empress of Russia.Footnote 2 He had been at Ems during the whole period of the Emperor Alexander's visit and he volunteered in the course of conversation to advert to the rumoured treaty and to state it to be his belief that nothing of a political character had been transacted at Ems and his positive conviction that nothing of a formal kind had been concluded. He knew the Emperor Alexander's mode of transacting business too well not to be certain that he would never commit himself to any political step in the absence of any of his political advisers; now not only was Prince Gortchakoff not at Ems but in the whole of the Emperor's suite there was not a single person who could pretend to the character of an “homme politique”.\n\nI observed that what appeared to have given rise to the rumour was the fact of Count Bismarck's sudden appearance at Ems from his retreat at Varzin.Footnote 3 The Federal Chancellor in common estimation was not supposed to be addicted to sacrifice his personal comfort or to undertake long journeys for mere purpose of Court etiquette and without being moved thereto by some political motive. I added that persons not unacquainted with the official atmosphere of Berlin had repeatedly told me that from the moment the result of the plébiscite and the adverse vote of the army were known,Footnote 4 promptly followed as those events were by the nomination of the Duc de Gramont to the post of Foreign Minister,Footnote 5 the Prussian Government had convinced themselves that the long dreaded catastrophe of a collision with France was at hand and could no longer be staved off. Under these circumstances people naturally inferred that the chances of such a conflict and the combinations arising out of it were likely to have been discussed by the August relatives on the occasion of their meeting at Ems. I made this Statement in order to elicit from the Prince whether during the course of his visit any thing had fallen from the Emperor which could have led him to believe that the prospect of a war with France had been discussed. He replied that this was an entirely new view of the matter to him and that he had always believed that the war had come as unexpectedly upon the Prussian Government as it had upon the rest of the world. I was unable to detect from any thing he said that he had gathered anything at Ems leading him to the belief that the peace of Europe hung upon a thread so soon to be snapped asunder.\n\nPrince Alexander mentioned two more facts not without interest.\n\nThe one was that on the breaking out of the warFootnote 6 he had received a letter from his brother in law in which the Emperor said: Our Neutrality depends on Austria's; – si l'autriche marche, nous marchons – without however alluding where he meant to march to – mais la direction de la marche, added the Prince, n’était pas difficile à deviner.Footnote 7 It was clear this letter was intended for further transmission to Vienna.\n\nThe other was that he had had a letter from his sister at the time of the Gortschakoff CircularFootnote 8 in which the Empress said that it appeared that Count Bismarck had been taken quite as much by surprize by the Russian Circular as the rest of the world had.\n\nIn estimating the value to be attached to the above statements it should be noted that Prince Alexander's close relationship to the Russian Court and the innumerable favours he has received from the Emperor & Empress give him a natural bias in favor of the Emperor, but that on the other hand his political sympathies are supposed to be altogether on the side of Austria where he served for many years and where he won the laurels to which he was unable to add in 1866.Footnote 9\n\nSupposing that at the instigation of the Federal Chancellor a confidential exchange of ideas respecting a possible war with France took place between the two Sovereigns it is certain that the attitude of Russia relatively to Austria must have played an important part in such a discussion. In such a case the Emperor would as carefully have avoided in conversing with his brother in law any reference to what had taken place as he afterwards ostentatiously informed him of his programme when it was convenient that the Austrian Court should know of it. I attach therefore no importance to Prince Alexander's ignorance of any “pourparlers” that may have taken place at Ems. On the other hand I think that his evidence establishes conclusively that no formal transaction was concluded.\n\nMy own conviction, aimed at by putting together many minute pieces of evidence collected during the course of the war, is that:\n\n1.st A very clear understanding was arrived at at a very early period between Russia & Prussia in respect to the attitude which the former would assume in case of a war between the latter and France, and that in all probability on this or perhaps a somewhat later occasion Prussia promised her good offices in regard to the Black Sea Question just as Count Beust did in 1867 and as it is said that General Fleury did on behalf of France last year, but that no position of this understanding ever took the shape of a treaty.Footnote 10\n\n2.ly that the Gortschakoff circular not only found no part of the understanding but that it took the Prussian Cabinet wholly by surprise at a moment when for some cause or the other there was a momentary coolness between the two Govts and that it was a blow struck quite as much at Prussia, if not more, than at the other cosignatories by Prince Gortschakoff behind the Emperor's back.\n\nFO 30/239: Robert B. D. Morier to Earl Granville, Confidential, No 6 Darmstadt, 8 April 1871\n\n[Received 10 April by messenger to Berlin. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate / G[ranville]]\n\nRumour of Dalwigk's resignation\n\nReports very generally accredited have been circulated during the last week to the effect that Baron Dalwigk is at last going to resign and make room for a successor, who, it is said, will be either M. Hoffmann [sic], the present Hessian Minister at Berlin, or Baron Rabenau, national liberal member of the German Parliament for Upper Hesse, or Count Görtz.\n\nI have not been able to ascertain what degree of truth is to be attached to these rumours but there is, I believe little doubt, that H.E. [His Excellency] is less firmly seated in the office to which he so much desires to cling than he has ever been before.\n\nI have so often adverted to Baron Dalwigk's abnormal position as the Minister of a State, the first condition of whose existence consists in cultivating good relations with Prussia, that I need hardly do so again.\n\nA man, who won his spurs as the trusted ally of M. de Beust against Prussia in the skirmishes which preceded the catastrophe of 1866 and the culminating act in whose official career was the determined hostility of his attitude agt Prussia in that year, ought to have seen thus having lost the game it would have been more dignified as regarded himself and more patriotic as regarded his country, to retire like his colleaguesFootnote 11 in two other States of the Anti Prussian Coalition. The position of a retired minister however is one which I have perceived is little sought after in these small countries and Baron Dalwigk clung to his post. He has always since, I believe, done what Berlin has told him to do: but he has always waited to be told, which was naturally annoying to persons desirous that the new federal machinery should appear to be moving smoothly on its’ own wheels. On the other hand he made no secret of his hopes that the structure of 1866Footnote 12 would be but a provisional edifice and that there was a good time coming in which Prussia would bite the dust.\n\nWhen the crisis of 1870 came the national party, as I reported to Your Lordship at the time, made a violent attack upon him which failed.Footnote 13 The events which have take [sic] place since, however, have not been favorable to him. He was left unnoticed by the Southern States when they made their arrangement for entering into the new Confederation with Prussia.Footnote 14 He was left equally unnoticed by the Federal Chancellor (whose agent M. Delbrück went to Münich Stuttgardt & Carlsruhe but never called at Darmstadt) and had at the last moment, when the Representatives of Bavaria, Würtemberg and Baden had already been some time at Versailles, to telegraph and ask permission to repair to Head Quarters uninvited.Footnote 15\n\nThe crowning act by which the Imperial Chancellor shewed the value which he set upon the cooperation of Hesse so long as she was in the hand of her present Minister was ignoring her existence in the negotiations for peace. The three Southern States were summoned to send Plenipotentiaries to assist both at the negotiations carried on at Versailles and those now going on at Brussels.Footnote 16 Hesse though as regards her Southern Provinces and the international Status of her Sovereign situated in exactly the same position as the other States of the South has been passed over under silence.\n\nThis marked expression of displeasure on the part of the Imperial Govt has naturally given strength to the feeling existing agt Baron Dalwigk in the ranks of the National Party, a feeling which found vent in the elections for the German ParliamentFootnote 17 at which all the Govt Candidates were defeated by immense majorities.\n\nNevertheless Baron Dalwigk's remaining or not remaining in office depending, as it does, wholly on the Grand Duke's pleasure and His Royal Highness’ dislike of change and of the trouble which any new ministerial combination might cause him being the main spring of his political action or rather inaction, there would still be chance for Baron Dalwigk were it not that I am told that the Grand Duke has been personally annoyed by his own name having been mixed up of late with the attacks made upon his Ministers.\n\nFO 30/239: Edmund W. Cope to Earl Granville, No 10, Darmstadt, 9 October 1871\n\n[Received 16 October by messenger. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate / Rome]\n\nResolutions passed at 5th German Protestant Congress\n\nThe fifth German Protestant Congress assembled at Darmstadt on the 4th Instant, and was largely attended by Representatives of Protestant Associations from different parts of Germany, and also by some delegates sent from other Countries, Professor Bluntschli, who was chosen one of the Presidents, in his speech attacked the order of Jesuits, and especially their right of association, held by many Protestants to be perfectly legitimate, and considered the order should be prohibited in Germany.Footnote 18\n\nThe Congress passed the two resolutions, which I have the honor to transmit herewith in Copy and translation.Footnote 19 The following day another resolution was passed by the Congress in favor of the Establishment of a German National Church with entire freedom for religious convictions and the investigations of science; this being directed against the so-called pietist party.Footnote 20\n\nA general meeting of Hessian Protestants on the same day not only endorsed these resolutions, but also proposed to memorialize The Grand Duke, the Reichstag and the Chancellor of the Empire on the subject, and called on all Protestants in Hesse, and those of their Roman Catholic country men who had not as yet yielded to ultramontanism, to join in combating it, and the advances of the Jesuits.Footnote 21 This meeting also passed a resolution relative to the Constitution of the Protestant Church in the Grand Duchy and the law of presentation,Footnote 22 in favor of the liberty of religious convictions.\n\nThese resolutions of the Protestant Congress show what a degree of irritation the dogma of the Papal InfallibilityFootnote 23 has caused and continues to excite in Germany, for it is hard to imagine the same individuals advocating freedom of religious conviction on the one hand, and clamoring for the State to interfere with the right of association on the other. Probably the Protestant party fear that the union of Germany being now accomplished, the fact of so much of the South being Catholic, may be an incentive to the Jesuits to organize with the Catholics of Westphalia, the Rhine, Posen, and other parts of the North, a party for putting a pressure on the Reichstag for carrying out ultramontane ideas, and with an excess of prudence have begun to cry before they are really hurt, and hence the resolution for the prohibition of the Order of Jesuits in Germany, which order has however, I believe, but twelve houses at the present moment.\n\nFO 30/240: Evan Montagu Baillie to Earl Granville, No 16, Darmstadt, 6 June 1872\n\n[Received 10 June by messenger. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Home Office; G[ranville]]\n\nSocial Democratic agitation in Hesse and Baden\n\nI had the honor in a previous Despatch to express to Your Lordship my apprehension that the Agitators of the Social Democratic Party would find in the Grand Duchy of Hesse a soil favorable for sowing seeds of their pernicious principles, and that these doctrines would be likely to take root and flourish here and I pointed out to Your Lordship the striking contrast that was observable in respect to the moral condition of the working classes, between the Grand Duchy of Baden which has for many years enjoyed the blessing of a liberal and patriotic Government and this country which has been one of the principal centres of a reactionary and anti national policy.\n\nI regret to say that the Experience of the last few months has only tended to confirm my apprehension.\n\nAs far as I am aware the socialist intrigues in Baden have totally failed. I do not assert that there have been no demands for increase of wages there but there have been no strikes worthy of the name, and any differences that have arisen between Master and workmen have been speedily adjusted without any injurious influence having been exercised upon the progress of business and Trade.\n\nIn this country on the other hand the case has been very different. The Socialist Agitators have long been hard at work here especially in the town of Mayence. Trade Unions have been founded, funds raised by Contributions of the members to meet the loss of wages and travelling Expenses, and strikes organized on the System adopted in Leipzig & Berlin[.]\n\nThese experiments have indeed inflicted on the work people [sic] than on the Masters, but they had the effect for a time of bringing trade in several branches to a complete stand still.\n\nMost of the differences have now at last been compromised by a 10 per cent increase of wages, and a reduction of the number of the hours of labor[.]\n\nIt is not easy to say how far this increase of wages is a fair one, but the general rate of wages has so much risen that many trades people can barely afford to carry on their business. The Shoemaking Trade in Mayence appears to have suffered the most. The workmen demanded 20 p. cent increase of wages and after months of negotiation the Masters finally decided in refusing all compromise whereupon about two hundred workmen took their departure and the rest yielded.\n\nThe Masters have now combined among themselves in self defence, and also with the object of sheltering the honest workmen against the terrorism of the Unions.\n\nThey have established advertising offices for labor, and have agreed among themselves to engage no workmen who they may consider to have been unjustifiably implicated in any strike.\n\nThey have further taken steps for establishing an industrial Tribunal of Arbitration and an Office for arranging differences.\n\nA large meeting has just taken place at CasselFootnote 24 of the Representatives of the Tobacco and Cigar Manufacturing Firms from all parts of Germany for a similar object, and apart from those immediately interested there are abundant signs that this important social question is engaging more and more, the attention of all classes of the people.\n\nFO 30/240: Evan Montagu Baillie to Earl Granville, No 18, Carlsruhe, 26 June 1872\n\n[Received 1 July by messenger. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate; G[ranville]]\n\nConservative press reflects general public opinion on relationship between Germany and Rome; socialist agitation; gloomy apprehensions for future of Germany\n\nI have the honor to forward in original and translation two articles from the Sud Deutsche Reichs Post, the organ of the National Conservative Party as shewing the direction in which Public Opinion is now moving in regard to the Question between Germany and Rome.Footnote 25\n\nThe Conservatives have been hitherto so averse to measures of a liberal tendency, that they have generally opposed the Policy adopted by Government in their struggle with Baden Jesuits and the Curia of Freiburg, a Policy precisely similar to that which is now to be applied throughout Germany.Footnote 26 The Conservative Party have always been inclined to regard the Baden Jesuits with a certain amount of charity and indulgence as forming a wholesome counterpoise to the Liberalism of the Government, and as the upholders of positive religion against the supposed infidel tendencies of the day.\n\nTheir tone has now completely changed, in a great degree owing no doubt to the effect produced by the Debates in the Reichstag at Berlin.Footnote 27\n\nThe Vatican CouncilFootnote 28 and the French War are now viewed as the result and outbreak of a vast conspiracy directed from Rome against the liberties of Europe, one great object having been to crush Prussia and render the Unity of Germany impossible. In short the language of the Conservative Press is quite as strong as anything to be found in the liberal Journals.\n\nAnother question which is now attracting the attention of the Public, is the encouragement which the Priests are apparently giving to the socialist agitation.\n\nIndependently of the numerous strikes which have taken place in various places, there is a spirit of restlessness and discontent observable among the working classes everywhere, and the best Masters are Complaining of the difficulties they meet with in dealing with their men.\n\nMany people are disposed to take a very gloomy view of the social condition of Germany[.]\n\nSuch persons fear that the rise of wages and consequent rise of the price of all the necessaries of life will eventually affect very seriously large numbers among the middle classes, especially public servants and officials with fixed incomes, who they fear will soon be utterly unable to meet the increased expense of living and be plunged into the greatest distress[.]\n\nThere is undoubtedly much room for gloomy apprehension, for Germany is now divided into two hostile Camps and embarked in a struggle which admits of no compromise and from which it is impossible for either side to retire.\n\nFO 30/240: Edmund W. Cope to Earl Granville, No 4, Darmstadt, 27 July 1872\n\n[Received 5 August by messenger. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate; Qy: Rome / Berlin; G[ranville]]\n\nFormation of Association of German Catholics in Hesse; remarks on religious conflict\n\nA Society calling itself the “Verein der Deutsche [sic] Katholiken”, “Union of German Catholics”, lately formed at Mayence has issued an AddressFootnote 29 to the Catholics of Germany on the subject of the so: called persecution of the Church, by which is meant, I conclude, the Law against the Jesuits and the recent attacks on the Ultramontanes in a part of the German press.\n\nThe President of the Society is Baron Felix v. Loe of Terporten and amongst a list of names of members of different Catholic Families of this and other parts of Germany who are on the Committee the two chief names of those belonging to Hesse are Prince Ysenburg=Birstein and Baron Franz von Wambolt.\n\nThe address issued by the Society closes as follows;\n\n“For GOD and Fatherland shall be our motto in the battle for which we prepare in this earnest moment. But only through unity can we hope to conquer, therefore must all the Catholic men of Germany agree as to the principles which are to direct their public conduct. They must unite in common action in order to exercise a proper influence on political life. Only by a steady and comprehensive organization can we be in the position to support our Press against the superior force of the enemy, in political elections to give effect to our votes, and to obtain for our interests a hearing from the Governments. In order to bring about such Unity among all German Catholics, a Society has lately been founded in Mayence the Statutes of which the above mentioned CommitteeFootnote 30 publish. All Catholic men in Germany who have at heart the liberty of the Church as well as the well being of the Fatherland are invited to enter it. The most holy endowments are in danger. Let us rouse ourselves then as true sons of the Church and the Fatherland. Let us fight perseveringly and fearlessly for right and truth for Right must remain Right and the final victory must be on the side of truth”[.]\n\nIt is much to be regretted that the Ultramontane Press on the one hand and a certain part of the what can better be called the would-be Liberal, than the Liberal, Press on the other continue to do all they can to foment religious differences in Germany, and it is a pity that instead of supporting the Press of one side as above suggested in the address, sensible men of both sides do not do more to write down those Papers which continue senseless and useless attacks whether directed against one side or the other. At the present moment the people most to be pitied in Germany are those Catholics, who having no wish to mix religion with politics, simply desire to worship GOD as their Great Grandfathers did before them, these are pestered to give their names to societies and their money to subscriptions for the Church in danger, while the extreme party of the other way of thinking are inclined to look upon them as so many Agents of the Jesuits.\n\nAs yet only two moves have been made, since the passing in Berlin of the Law relative to the Jesuits of the 4th of July, by the Government here which have attracted the attention of the above: mentioned combatants, one was that a circular was sent on the occasion of the publication of the Law relative to the Jesuits in the Grand Duchy, to the different prefectures asking if there were Jesuits residing in the Department and if so how many.Footnote 31 The second was that the Government ceased to use the “Mainzer Journal”, the organ of Bishop Ketteler, as the Paper for the insertion of the different Government notices for the Province of Rhein Hesse as hitherto, and gave them to the “Mainzer Tageblatt” another paper published in Mayence.Footnote 32 Simple as these two things are they caused a sort of crow of defiance from the Ultramontanes and a kind of cry for more from the other extreme party, it is not expected that either the pugnacity of the one party or the rapacity of the other will be gratified. The Ministry at present in power will not wish for anything better than to let alone and be left alone and if they are stirred to anything it must be through some unusual pressure from without, they are as certain to show no spirited opposition to such pressure should it come, as they are sure to oppose it with all the vis inertiae possible.\n\nI do not anticipate that much will be done from Berlin unless the Hessian Ultramontanes from sniffing the fray too often, and being pecked at too much by the other extreme party should get more troublesome, anything like a regular persecution of individual Jesuits would only make them martyrs in the eyes of many who consider at present that it is quite possible for Germany to get on without them, and whether it was really advisable or not to promulgate the Law, which is not for me to discuss, it would utterly defeat its purpose if the individual members were through persecution to work on in secret under false colors, for it is not probable that those who wish to do so will be able to localize the whole Society of Jesus where they wish and draw a cordon round it like a herd infected with Rinderpest[.]\n\nFO 30/241: Evan Montagu Baillie to Earl Granville, No 9, Darmstadt, 28 April 1873\n\n[Received 1 May by private hand. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate; Qy: Berlin; G[ranville]]\n\nBeer riots in Frankfurt and other towns; not the result of dissatisfaction with Prussian rule; general observations on public feeling towards Prussia\n\nA few weeks ago the towns of Constance and Mannheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden were the scene of riots of rather an alarming character, of which the ostensible cause was a rise in the price of a glass of beer from four to four and a half Kreutzer.Footnote 33\n\nAs these demonstrations of popular discontent were secretly planned in the workmen's clubs, aided no doubt by Agents of the “Internationale”Footnote 34 who are everywhere active in sowing the seeds of mischief, the authorities were taken by surprise, and before the assistance of the troops could be obtained, several breweries were demolished with a very considerable loss of property.\n\nThe mob, however, was eventually dispersed without bloodshed, and, as far as I am aware, without any loss of life.\n\nThe town of Frankfurt has just been visited by a similar calamity, but unhappily in the struggle to restore order, sixteen persons appear to have been killed, and upwards of forty wounded.Footnote 35\n\nThe causes of this last riot were exactly the same as they were in Baden, and perfectly clear and unmistakable. Comparatively few, however, of the Frankfurt workmen were engaged in it; the mass came from Offenbach, Hanau, and other towns of the neighbourhood, and were simply intent upon plunder. They are discontented at the rise in the price of provisions, following, as it necessarily must, from a general rise of wages, and the addition of half a Kreutzer to the price of a glass of beer, formed a convenient pretext for a demonstration.\n\nI have nevertheless observed a letter from a British correspondent at Frankfurt in the “Times”,Footnote 36 in which the writer attributes a popular character to the riot, as he says that it has its origin in the universal dissatisfaction felt with the Prussian system of Government.Footnote 37\n\nThis statement is so absurd that it scarcely deserves notice: and to any one who knows any thing about this part of the country, it can only serve to show that the writer is a sympathiser with one or other of those extreme parties who never lose an opportunity of endeavouring to excite the people against the Prussian Government.\n\nThe bitterness felt by the Frankfort people against Prussia after 1866, has been much softened, and to a great degree obliterated by the war, uniting, as it did, all parties against a common enemy.\n\nMoreover Frankfurt, instead of exhibiting any of the symptoms of a once flourishing town falling into decay and insignificance, as was predicted would be the case, appears on the contrary, to be reanimated with fresh vigour, and has advanced, and is still progressing on the path of wealth and general prosperity.\n\nThe people of Frankfort have consequently no ground to be dissatisfied with the Prussian Government.\n\nThey have had time to reflect that there is a certain connexion between Commercial prosperity and the character of Government, and they cannot fail to perceive at the same time that the Prussian Government, whatever its faults may be, is fully able to cope with those extreme parties which aim on the one side, to sap the foundations of all liberal progress, and on the other, to destroy the foundations of society itself; and who are now acting to a great degree in concert as the avowed enemies of the Empire.\n\nThe mask is now thrown off, and it is clear to all what hostility to the Empire really means.\n\nThe people of Hesse who were at one time little, if at all less disaffected to Prussia than the Frankfurters, returned to the Hessian Parliament at the late Elections,Footnote 38 members, with the exception of a very small and insignificant minority, who are unanimous in supporting the present liberal and national Government.\n\nSuch a fact as this speaks for itself, and shows what a remarkable change has passed over the minds of the people in the last few years.\n\nThe writer of the letter to which I have alluded also says that the troops not only did what they could to provoke the people, but that they fired upon an inoffensive and “laughing” crowd.\n\nThe troops on the contrary behaved with great moderation. In attempting to arrest the ringleaders, they were pelted with stones and bricks. In the first instance they replied with a volley of blank cartridges, and it was not until after resistance had been repeated, that they sent a volley of bullets among the mob.\n\nIt is, however, I fear, quite true that the Frankfurt authorities, though they expected a riot, were culpably negligent in not taking care that an imposing mass of troops were at hand, ready to act at the first appearance of a disturbance. If this had been done, in all probability the mob would have quickly dispersed, as was the case at Mannheim, and firing would have been unnecessary.\n\nIt is not at all impossible that similar disturbances will be attempted in general towns in Hesse, but I understand that the necessary precautions are taken. The military will be at hand and the authorities well prepared.\n\nFO 30/241: Hubert E. H. Jerningham to Earl Granville, No 2, Darmstadt, 8 August 1873\n\n[Received 11 August. For: The Queen / Gladstone / Circulate / Rome / Berlin / Paris; G[ranville]]\n\nConversation with Bishop Ketteler on Bismarck's ‘cynical’ attitude towards legislation regarding Catholics\n\nI had the occasion a short time back at Mayence of being presented to Monseigneur Ketteler, Bishop of that city, and, as Your Lordship is aware, the Catholic Champion of Southern Germany.\n\nHe is a Prussian nobleman by birth, and has always enjoyed much consideration at Berlin as a patriot and a man of great ability.\n\nThe conversation with which he favoured me appears to me so interesting in the present state of the conflict between Prince Bismarck and the Church of Rome in Germany, that I venture to acquaint Your Lordship with its substance, though I am aware it can have but an historical value.\n\nThe Bishop at once began on the subject which is uppermost in his mind, i e. the absence of religious faith which he deplores in his native land and to which he attributes all the misfortunes that beset his party.\n\n“The progress of rationalism and of positivism, he said, is such, that it requires on the part of those whose duty it is to combat its encroachments, a degree of faith almost beyond what they can reasonably expect from the divine grace.”\n\n“Happy England”, he exclaimed, [“]there you still have the life of Christianity in a religious conviction. Would that I could say the same of Germany.”\n\n“To believe, that is the great point: the “hauptsache”, but the torrent of rationalism is daily weakening the religious faith that remains, and I except no religious denomination.”\n\nMonseigneur Ketteler then got very animated on the subject of Prince Bismarck, and what he called that statesman's “wicked cynicism”, and proceeded to illustrate his meaning by the following account of a conversation he had had with the Prince.Footnote 39\n\nIt would seem, as Monsigneur Ketteler explained to me, that the laws in Prussia defining the relations of the Church and the State as they existed before 1870 were of an essentially liberal character. The Bishop I believe, meant liberal in the sense that these laws which were passed in 1850Footnote 40 by a party anxious to proclaim a free church in the free State, were favorable to the Catholics of Prussia. In the new laws, however, which are being framed, and to be enforced throughout the newly constituted Empire of Germany, it is proposed to introduce regulations copied, so I understood, upon those already in existence in Baden and in Bavaria, but principally in the former.Footnote 41\n\nThough Bavaria is essentially a Catholic Country, it would appear that the relations of the Church and the State since the abrogation of the Bavarian ConcordatFootnote 42 are such that the Catholics are not so favoured as they were in Prussia under Protestant rulers.\n\nMonsignor Ketteler fought Prince Bismarck, therefore, on the ground that the existing laws should be retained in the new German code, advocating as his principal reason that the union of the Church and of the State are necessary to the peace and unity of the German Fatherland.\n\nPrince Bismarck's reply was characteristic.\n\n“Believe me, Monseigneur, he said, no other but political combinations actuate my conduct. I am the servant of my country and a workman for its good and its prosperity.”\n\n“I will be perfectly frank with you.”\n\n“If in 1850 we framed laws that were favorable to the Catholics, the reason is that we wanted their support at that time, and we naturally had to conciliate them.”\n\n“Matters have changed now and it is indispensable for me to have a liberal majority to depend on.”\n\n“This I cannot obtain without conciliating both Baden and Bavaria. I must therefore entertain the proposed modifications and promote their success.”\n\n“Your Grace is at liberty to combat me by all the means in your power: indeed I hope you may succeed, for, believe me, I have not expressed to you that which I feel: I have only told you my political convictions. I have given you the arguments of reason and of policy, not those of the heart, for I can assure you I would not for worlds endanger the salvation of my soul.”\n\nBishop Ketteler was very much excited all the while he told me of this interview, and his tone was almost imploring in his desire to know whether a greater show of cynicism had ever before been exhibited.\n\nI ventured to improve the opportunity thus afforded me of learning Monseigneur Ketteler's views generally, by asking him what importance he attached to the Old Catholic movement.Footnote 43\n\nHe replied that he attached no importance to it whatever and added that if it had not enjoyed political support in Baden and elsewhere in Germany but principally in Prussia, it would have died out altogether, for, added the Bishop continuing his old line of argument, with few exceptions, those who have joined the movement are men who had long lived in that unfortunate state of want of faith which he so much deplored, and had, therefore, long been out of the pale of the Catholic Church.\n\nI may, however, point out to Your Lordship a passage in a pamphletFootnote 44 published a short time back by Monseigneur Ketteler which shows at least that in his own mind, he attaches more importance to the Old Catholic movement than he apparently was willing to acknowledge in conversation with me, for he complains of its being one of the instruments in the hands of the liberal party intended to weaken the Catholic cause in Germany.\n\n“The object of the national liberal party is forcibly to tear the links which unite the Catholic Church and the people, using as a means to this end both Protestantism, the religion of the State, and the Old Catholics”.\n\nFO 30/241: Hubert E.

That the French wished it, he had no doubt: that they would undertake it shortly he did not believe, as they were not prepared; but could they only find sufficiently powerful allies, he did not think that their aggression would be dependent upon their state of preparation.”\n\n“This” added the Minister “is a fact palpable to all and mostly to those interested in the matter, viz to all Germany.”\n\n“Such being the case, and the revenge of France being only a question of time, was it not a necessary and fatal political duty incumbent upon the Government of the German Empire to parry the blow they saw being prepared for them, by a bold thrust given in time?”\n\nTo my remark that I thought it rather doubtful whether the justice of any Country would acquit the man who armed to the teeth, should assault the convalescent victim of his former blow, because of the possibility of this former victim getting strong again, His Excellency replied “that undoubtedly it might not be a very moral act, but it certainly was one dictated by policy; and in some cases policy might be deemed a moral virtue when it concerned the welfare and security of millions.”\n\n“Were he, Prince Bismarck, he would naturally be overwhelmed by the huge responsibility which such a position entails; but while guarding to the utmost against placing his Country in the wrong, he most decidedly would not shrink from the duty of considering how far he was justified as Head of the Government of the Country in allowing a neighbouring nation time and the opportunity to become powerful knowing that nation's efforts to be directed against his own Fatherland.”\n\n“France” continued Mr Hofmann “is sufficiently intelligent to know and understand this. She is still sufficiently unprepared to dread the realisation in Germany of the position her daily increasing power is creating: hence the expression of that fear in the “Scare letter” to the Times, and which, if written at all by a Frenchman,Footnote 66 reads like an appeal to other Powers to take pity upon her. It is quite true, said Mr Hofmann, that the possession of Belfort by France is not looked upon with favour in Germany, and it is of public notoriety, added he, that General v Moltke was very much against the cession of it, which Prince Bismarck had urged.Footnote 67 It is not to be wondered at therefore, if such a bone of contention occasionally gives rise to a fear on the part of those now enjoying it, lest those who could have retained it should feel inclined, as a matter of security, to reclaim it when the opportunity offers.”\n\nSuch plain language needs no comment, but Your Lordship will gather from the fact of its unmistakable plainness that the projects at Berlin are being slowly and surely matured throughout Germany and nothing shows this so much as the kind of training to face any eventuality which the people go through at the voice of their leaders, a specimen of which the above reported conversation may fairly be considered to be.\n\nIt is an undeniable fact, I believe, that while peace is not only ardently longed for by, but is vitally necessary to Germany, the Germans one and all believe in the necessity of a second war with France before a lasting peace can be obtained: and this belief has been fostered by the authorities until it has reached the degree of conviction, and acts depressingly upon the commercial welfare of the nation.\n\nThere is a second notion which the Germans are less ready to admit but which comes out forcibly in conversation with them, and is a sign of their innate dread of the French, notwithstanding their contempt for French frivolity “leichtsinnigkeit”: that is, that a second war with France must be undertaken while those Generals are alive who have made Germany great. “Generals not armies win a war[”] is a prevalent notion deserving of attention.\n\nIf from the people one turns to the Government, Your Lordship will hear from better sources how necessary it is to drown home troubles; even if it be in the more open though not less dangerous sea of foreign wars; and will gather on the whole that if M de Bismarck is the hope of his country, he is not the less its bugbear.\n\nFO 30/244: Hubert E.

For: The Queen / Disraeli / Circulate / Berlin; D[erby]]\n\nDecline of Hessian independence; short history of the Grand Duchy and its political doings since 1866\n\nAlthough I approach the subject with great diffidence, still I think it my duty to point out to Your Lordship, as far as I am able, how it is daily becoming more evident that the independence of the Grand Duchy of Hesse is an absolutely nominal one, and that this state of things may lead sooner than is expected to ideas of absolute incorporation on the part of Prussia.\n\nIndeed a very simple survey of the facts which have come to pass since the war of Germany with France, and the altered position which that war has created to Hesse, are enough to show that its annexation to Prussia is a logical result of the success & policy of that country.\n\nA little more reflection shows that the powerful protection of Russia, (whose EmpressFootnote 73 is sister to the reigning Grand Duke of Hesse), and the friendship of the two Emperors of Germany and Russia, are the only guarantees of independent sovereignty possessed by the Grand Duke, while they constitute the only obstacle which Prince Bismarck cannot drive sternly and roughly over.\n\nBefore the year 1866 the Grand Duchy of Hesse possessed a geographical advantage which made her vote in the DietFootnote 74 one of very great importance, separating as she did the Palatinate from the Mother Country, Bavaria, and the Grand Duchy of Baden from the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nShe was moreover the possessor of that bank of the Rhine which was so coveted by France, and on whatever side Hesse voted, she must carry the majority.\n\nThe war of 1866Footnote 75 came, and only changed the physiognomy of those who had formerly courted the favours of the Grand Duchy; for, when the victors perceived, that powerful Imperial protection was at hand to prevent the total incorporation of Hesse into the Kingdom of Prussia, the North German Confederation endeavoured to supplant the hitherto successful Austrian influences, and postponed the doom, which has not, however, been lost sight of.\n\nThe war of 1870 did away with the frontier character of the Grand Duchy, and lost her the only remaining geographical prestige she possessed.Footnote 76\n\nSurrounded by Prussia on all sides, having been previously beaten by her into submission, the Country was glad to pay the exemption from total annexation, by a voluntary resignation of all its former ambition and privileges, for the sake of the great Fatherland of Germany, which screened the smaller Fatherland of Prussia that put the high sounding nameFootnote 77 forward, and reaped the reward of its adroitness.\n\nThe nation was not sufficiently recovered from its old Austrian sympathies to side at once with its new masters, and a party therefore had to be formed, which became the National Liberal party,Footnote 78 and which, without offending the notion of Hessian loyalty to the Grand Duke, should fire the enthusiasm of the people for German unity, under cover of which pretext, though in most instances with perfect good faith, it worked in the interest of Prussia, and of the policy her great MasterFootnote 79 had found necessary to adopt to gain success in Southern Germany.\n\nThis party, the result of a successful war in the cause of German Unity, naturally killed any Hessian national party that had existed before, and it became necessary to select chiefs to guide its enthusiasm and control its ardour, lest the cooling down of Imperial aspirations should bring the reality too soon and too clearly to view.\n\nHerr von Dalwighk was replaced by Herr Hofmann who sometime before had acted as his Secretary, and had latterly been employed at BerlinFootnote 80 under the Chancellor who had noticed his quick apprehension of subjects and his valuable talents as the expounder of other people's thoughts.\n\nTo him was entrusted the great mission of endeavouring to work down the animosity of the Hessians generally for the Prussian name, by the instrumentality of the National Liberal party, and under the colour of German patriotism.\n\nThe despatches marked in the margin, which I had the honour to address to Your Lordship's predecessor in office and to yourself in the years 1873 and 1874 and 1875 will show you how Mr Hofmann set to work to his task with all the earnestness of a blind believer in the power and policy of the German Prime Minister.\n\nThe Prussian Education system was substituted after much difficulty, to that which formerly gave the Hessian Parents a remnant of authority over their children.Footnote 81 [Note in margin: ‘No 3. Augt 1873’]\n\nThe encouragement given at the outset to Bishop Reinkens and his absurd sect, which the Bishop of MayenceFootnote 82 once cleverly denounced as “diese infame Bismarckerei”Footnote 83 was the prelude of the alliance of this Country with Prussia in its individual struggle against the Papacy and its followers, and led to his recognition.Footnote 84 [Note in margin: ‘No 7[.] Sept: 12. 1873’]\n\nThe assimilation of Evangelical doctrines throughout Prussia was followed by a Bill presented by the Hessian Government for a similar object in the Grand Duchy. [Note in margin: ‘No 11. Oct 4. 1873’]Footnote 85\n\nThe abolition of responsible Ministers, and the centralization of power in the hands of one minister, exalted the position of the Chancellor's trusted Agent while it led the way to the natural & national cry that direct Government is better than that through substitutes.Footnote 86 [Note in margin: ‘No 14[.] Oct 21. 1873’]\n\nCivil marriage was declared to be compulsory throughout Hesse, in anticipation of a law to that effect which was carried shortly after in the Prussian Landtag.Footnote 87 [Note in margin: ‘No 16[.] Nov 4. 1873’]\n\nThe election of a presidentFootnote 88 of the Hessian Chambers was made the means of obliging the Grand Duke to submit his will to that of the National Liberal Party by forcing him to elect the man of their choices, and thus lessening his prestige in the eyes of his people and especially of their Representatives. [Note in margin: ‘No 2. June 4. 1874’]\n\nLastly the law regulating the relations of the Church and of the State, through an amendment of the Falk laws, brought the hated Bishop of Mayence within the Scope of avenging authority, while it dealt in Hesse the same severe blows that it did in Prussia upon the Catholic subjects of that Kingdom. [Note in margin: ‘Mr Ford No 17[.] of 28. April 1875’]Footnote 89\n\nAs Your Lordship perceives, these measures when compared with those passed in the Prussian Chambers savour of a steady and uniform policy, ably carried out by the AgentFootnote 90 of the MinisterFootnote 91 who conceived it.\n\nHad that policy been truly & honestly German instead of palpably Prussian and sectarian, the first object it had in view of uniting all Germans in one bond of friendship and under one system of impartial and beneficial laws would have been hailed with enthusiasm, and would have produced results very different to those evident, in the two Grand DuchiesFootnote 92 at least, of which I am entitled to speak.\n\nAs it is, the ultimate object of Prussia is palpable to the most blinded, and the love of Germany which is unquestionable, is not yet strong enough to drive the distaste of Prussia from the thoughts of the people.\n\nPrussian ambition has oozed out notwithstanding the effort to hide it.\n\nA more practical turn is given to these rather sentimental feelings, (tho’ in the case of 18 million Catholics of the Empire these feelings are acutely painful) by a glance at the commercial downfall and nullity of a country which should through its resources and its population become a prosperous little State. [Note in margin: ‘Coml [Commercial] No 1. Sept 3. 1875’]\n\nAs it is, the value of imported goods exceeds yearly that of the exports by nearly 35%, and while the Country pays taxes which are raised every recurring financial period to face an increased expenditure caused by the increased price of living, the most prolific sources of revenue such as those derived from telegraphs, postage, stamps and Customs are paid into the Imperial or in other words the Prussian treasury.\n\nIf then it be borne in mind that the Hessian child is educated under a Prussian system – that when old enough to serve, he becomes a soldier in the Prussian army – that the Grand Duke of Hesse cannot promote his own subjects in his own nominal army – that the army is paid from Berlin – that the public offices are under Prussian tutelage – that the clergy is subject to Prussian laws – that the principal revenues of the country revert to Berlin – that the Legislative Chamber is made up of a Prussian party – that its leader, who is at the same time the sole Minister of Hesse, is an Agent of Prussia; the question must force itself to the mind: what is the independence of the Grand Duchy? Where are the Grand Duke's sovereign rights and when will this abnormal state of things come to an end?\n\nIt lies not with me to say when the total annexation of this Country is to take place, but I have deemed it my duty to show Your Lordship, though very feebly, how logically impossible it is for this Grand Duchy to maintain an independence which at present is so purely nominal, and which indeed is probably dependent on the life of the present Grand Duke only, unless any political event arises to make it advisable on the part of Prussia to annex Baden and Hesse, even more promptly than it can yet be anticipated.\n\nFO 30/244: Hubert E.

The prominence given to this Grand Duchy by its principal Representative in the spirit of animosity against the Empire which he supposes exists in the Country, is so important a blunder, that the present irritation of the people and particularly of the Hessian Press, against Mr Hoffmann [sic] is not only quite comprehensible but almost excusable.\n\nFO 30/245: Hubert E.

I understand on very good authority that Herr Delbrück himself recommended Mr Hofmann to the Chancellor as his successor, knowing him to be that which he is, a clear headed and indefatigable worker; and Prince Bismarck was all the more pleased with this selection that he could at once announce in the “National Zeitung” that the policy of which Herr Delbrück was the expression would in no ways be altered by his successor.\n\nAlthough Mr Hofmann has not yet sent me word of his acceptance of the office according to his promise, still, it is little matter of doubt that he will take the appointment; and if he does, the party that wish to give the Empire a more substantial character than what it at present possesses, will gain a strong ally in his person.\n\nAs Your Lordship is aware, all my despatches for the last three years have tended to prove that the acts of the Hessian Minister were inspired from Berlin and that Mr Hofmann was in reality the trusted Agent of Prince Bismarck.\n\nHis selection, therefore, at the present time when the question of the German railways seems paramount in the mind of the Imperial Chancellor, is not to be wondered at, when that Statesman is in want of a lieutenant who shall be so thoroughly devoted to him as to become his mouthpiece, and I can but refer Your Lordship again to my despatch No 16 of the 7th March last, to show how the language of Mr Hofmann justifies his selection for this duty.Footnote 107\n\nAgain Mr Hofmann has lost in this country the influence which he possessed when he was first appointed. The National party which he was to guide have broken through the limits set to them, and the personal prestige of the minister suffered from the unfortunate speech he delivered at Berlin in January, and which I reported to Your Lordship in my despatch No 11 of the 3 February.Footnote 108\n\nHis selection now, while it shows that he spoke under the inspiration of higher personages at that time, is a proof that these have recognised in him too devoted a follower not to reward his ardour in their cause, and have thus saved him from the eventual resignation of office which that loss of prestige in their account had made a question of time only, and which I had taken the liberty to point out in the above named despatch.\n\nMr Hofmann is a sincere partisan of the Empire, and is a believer in the infallibility of Prince Bismarck as a Statesman; but he is an honest, straightforward man, who must please all those with whom he comes into contact, even though his personal devotion to a cause may be forgotten under his appearance of subserviency to another's will.\n\nYour Lordship will allow me to refer you to the conversation I had with Mr Hofmann last spring on the occasion of the designs of Prussia against France, and which I reported in my despatch No 19 of the 11th May 1875 for a proof of how in Foreign matters also, the views of the new or coming-new Vice Chancellor agree with those of his master.Footnote 109\n\nBaron Starck will be Mr Hofmann's successor here; and though, it is early in the day to speak of him, it is certain that the Grand Duchy will not benefit by the change.\n\nFO 30/245: Hubert E.

For: The Queen / Lord Beaconsfield / Circulate / Prince of Wales; D[erby]]\n\nReichstag elections in Baden and Hesse; reasons for socialist progress\n\nThe elections for the ReichsrathFootnote 118 have produced some unexpected results in this country and in the Grand Duchy of Baden, while they have revealed some unpleasant facts.\n\nOut of the nine Hessian electoral circumscriptions, a second ballot has come necessary in three: viz at Mayence, at Offenbach and at Darmstadt, that is, in the three principal towns of the Grand Duchy.\n\nAt Mayence, the Ultramontane Candidate Dr Moufang, tho’ polling seven hundred votes more than in his successful election in 1874, was beaten in the 2nd ballot by a National Liberal,Footnote 119 who formerly was a democrat, and who, owing to hopes of his returning to democratic views, secured the abstention of the social democrats.\n\nAt Offenbach the National Liberal Newspaper editor Dr Dernburg of Berlin has to undergo on the 26th a second ballot against the well known Socialist “Liebknecht” of Leipzig, and it is very uncertain whether the latter will not prove successful, especially after the election of a DemocratFootnote 120 for the neighbouring or rather adjoining town of Frankfurt on the Main.\n\nAt Darmstadt, the national Liberal candidateFootnote 121 has to undergo a second trial against a manFootnote 122 of more democratic views, though no Socialist, and is almost certain of defeat.\n\nBut while the strength of the National Liberals which Hesse sends to the Imperial Reichsrath will not be materially altered, as the defeat of the opposition Candidate at Mayence is likely to be compensated by that of the National Liberal here, still it remains a fact, pregnant with significance, that one eighth of those who recorded their votes in the first elections where each party could rely on a candidate, are social democrats, the numbers being 16 801 votes out of 132 987 votes, a somewhat startling revelation.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Baden has returned National Liberals in eight out of fourteen electoral circumscriptions, but the late President of State Mr Jolly, the Baden “âme damnée”Footnote 123 of the Berlin Chancellor, has to fight a second election against the Protestant Ultramontane or German Conservative candidate,Footnote 124 and a second ballot against a Catholic UltramontaneFootnote 125 is necessary at Freiburg in Breisgau.\n\nThe social democrats, have only polled about 7000 votes in the total of 231 235 recorded votes or a little less than 1/30th, though about 25% more than in 1874.\n\nThe great features of these elections have been[:]\n\n1[.] the increased desire of the population to testify to their political bias, as shown by the greatly increased number of those who took part in the voting:\n\n2. the incipient disgust for the subservient national liberals, who, more Imperial than the Emperor, hasten somewhat too rashly to throw off the cloak of their own smaller nationalities.\n\n3[.] the growing strength and organization of the German Socialistic element, which the military despotism of Germany is daily fanning into a blaze of revolution which it will e'er long be called upon to put down, and which the ill advised internal policy of Prince Bismarck has done more to bring about, than even the bad state of trade and industry, and the absorption in military preparations of the money which might have been profitably spent among the otherwise peaceful and quiet German labouring classes.\n\nFO 30/246: Hubert E.
