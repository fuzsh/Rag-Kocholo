        "text": "Wikipedia states that there are five legitimate successors of the ancient Order of Saint John:\n\nThe entities generally considered to maintain historical continuity with the Knights are the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, based in Rome and recognized by over 100 countries worldwide, as well as the chivalric orders in the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem: the Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Chivalric Order of Saint John of the Hospital at Jerusalem, Johanniter Orde in Nederland, Order of Saint John in Sweden, and the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.\n\nWikipedia\n\nWithout exception, the members of this ‘Alliance’ claim to be the historical successor of the ancient Hospital of Saint John, formed in the 11th century in Jerusalem:\n\nWe are also united in one fight against False Orders, those self constituted and self styled groups which lack both authenticity or legitimacy of origin but variously describe themselves as an “Order of St. John” or an “Order of Malta”. However the Johanniter Orden in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands is a legitimate and honoured ally.\n\nWe pledge ourselves anew to carry into the Twentyfirst Century the historical aims and obligations of our Orders.\n\nSee: Appendix 1 and 2\n\nHowever, none of the members can substantiate their claim, as will be shown hereafter.\n\nSovereign Order of Malta\n\nThe current Sovereign Order of Malta claims to be founded in the 11th century:\n\nThe Sovereign Order of Malta is one of the oldest institutions of Western and Christian civilisation. A lay religious order of the Catholic Church since 1113 (…). Founded in Jerusalem in the 11th century, the Order of Malta has a long history of service to the vulnerable and the sick. This 900-year history is reflected in its full name: Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta.\n\nOfficial website SMOM\n\nComment\n\nThe current Order of Malta cannot claim to be “founded in the 11th century”. The original Order was dissolved by Napoleon in 1798 (see also: Scicluna, 2014 and Part 1 of this article series):\n\nBy 1806, Napoleon had suppressed all what was left of the original Order in France and in Italy. [Smith/Storace, Order of St. John of Jerusalem, p. 43, for further details.] During the period 1805-1810, the Commanderies of Germany, Italy and Bavaria were swept away, Portugal was ravaged and Sicily sequestrated the Sicilian Commanderies for the Royal Treasure. On 24 March 1806, the two Russian Grand Priories (through the marionet Sacred Council) accepted that customary procedure must be followed pending the confirmation of the Candidate for the Magistry (Caracciolo). On 12 July 1806, the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine expropriated the Priory of Germany. In the year 1806, also the Grand Priories of Venice, Lombardy and Germany were expropriated. On 13 July 1806, King Gustaf IV of Sweden offered Gotland to Guevara-Sardo, who declined. In 1807, Pius VII confirmed Guevara-Sardo to stay on as Lt. Grandmaster of the Papal Order and rejected Caracciolo.\n\nHoegen Dijkhof 2006, p. 195\n\nThe current Order was revived by the Pope in 1879, when the office of Grandmaster was restored by Pope Leo XIII. He confirmed Count Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce as the new Grandmaster after almost 80 years of vacancy (see Part 1). Therefore, the current Sovereign Order of Malta was formed in 1879, not in the 11th century as it unjustly claims.\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem\n\nThe British Order of Saint John also claims to be founded in the 11th century:\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem – commonly known as the Order of St John – has a unique combination of features and has its roots in a hospice (hospital) founded in Jerusalem in the 11th century.\n\nOfficial website Order of Saint John\n\nComment\n\nHistorian François Velde gives a detailed account of the development of the British Order of Saint John:\n\nThis Victorian invention has its origins in the turmoil of the Napoleonic era. Following the capture of Malta in 1798 and the conquest of most of Europe by Napoleon, the Order was quite disorganized in 1814. The return of the Bourbons to France prompted the formation of a “capitular commission” of the French langues by an assembly of French knights in May 1814, which was initially recognized by Louis XVIII, and approved by a papal bull of August 10, 1814. It began lobbying for a return of the Order’s French properties, and acting at the Congress of Vienna for a return of the island of Malta. (…)\n\nThe French Commission, then controlled by its Chancellor Pierre-Hippolyte de Sainte Croix-Molay, then turned to the possibility of helping the Greeks in their war of independence, and a treaty was signed between the Commission and the Greek rebels in June 1823. The treaty promised the order several Greek islands and Rhodes (should it be conquered), and in exchange the Order would raise troops and 10 million Francs. To begin the process the Commission started making knights rather indiscriminately, at least 200 in the space of a few years. But the treaty was opposed by other Greek rebel groups, as well as England and Austria. (…). The Lieutenant of the Order dissolved the commission. The floatation of the loan in the form of bonds on the London market collapsed before it started.\n\nThe Commission nevertheless revived itself in 1826, under the presidency of Calonne d’Avesnes but still controlled by Sainte Croix-Molay, and continued in its attempts at raising money for its Greek operation. At this time it was totally unofficial, disavowed by the Order of Malta and unrecognized by the French government. The Commission decided to search private sources of funds in England, and opened negotiations with a Scot called Donald Currie, an acquaintance of Sainte Croix-Molay. In 1827 Instruments of Convention were signed between the Commission and Currie, enabling him to raise L240,000 by recruiting new members (even non-Catholics). Currie did not raise much money but he recruited avidly.\n\nGreek independence having been achieved without any participation of the Order, Sainte Croix-Molay now turned to the possibility of settling in Algeria, conquered in 1830 by the French. But the same year Charles X was overthrown, and the Commission lost all influence with the French government, which also broke diplomatic relations with the Lieutenancy in Messina. Nevertheless the Commission continued to encourage the formation of an English Langue, which took place in January 1831, with the election of Sr Robert Peat, Bart, former chaplain of George IV, as “Prior ad interim of the Tongue of England”. However, a split amongst the British members occurred the next year. By 1837, the party which the French Commission had recognized had more or less disappeared, and the other party led by Robert Peat continued on its own. Peat was succeeded by Sir Robert Dymoke in 1838, Lt-Col. Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, Bart, in 1847, Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Arbuthnot in 1860. (…)\n\nThe English group almost disappeared, but, led by Sir John Broun, it persisted in hoping for recognition, basing themselves on letters patent of 1557 recreating the order in England (although it was abolished again by Elizabeth I in 1560). Now called “the Sovereign and Illustrious Order of Saint-John of Jerusalem: Anglia”, it made contact again in 1857 with the Lieutenancy of the Order in Rome, through a Catholic member of the English group, John James Watts. Negotiations started, with the aim of establishing a Catholic priory, which in turn would form a Protestant branch (the existing group, of course). The Lieutenancy was initially favorably disposed, but the three English knights of Malta, led by Sir George Bowyer, and including John James Watts, who had just been received as members and were to form the Catholic priory decided to break off with the English group instead. A British Association of the Order of Malta was to be founded in 1876.\n\nThe English association nevertheless persisted in its efforts at some kind of recognition. It enlisted the support of the 7th duke of Manchester who became their grand prior in 1861. The group drew up a Constitution in 1871 and renamed itself more modestly “Order of Saint-John of Jerusalem in England”. A corps of ambulances was created in the 1860s, roughly around the same time as (or preceding) the real Order of Malta’s charitable activities and those of the Red Cross. The Princess of Wales became Lady of the Order in 1876, and she in turn secured the membership of the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe priory finally received a royal charter in 1888, which changed its name to The Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint-John of Jerusalem, and made the sovereign of Great Britain its Sovereign Head and Patron. The Prince of Wales was appointed Grand Prior in 1890 by Queen Victoria, and since then the Prior has always been a member of the royal family.\n\nFrançois R. Velde, heraldica.org\n\nAs Velde notes, the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem was formed in 1876, instead of the 11th century as it unjustly claims.\n\nJohanniterorden (Germany)\n\nThe German Order of Saint John mentions that it has been formed in 1351:\n\nDie seit 1351 nachgewiesene Balley Brandenburg, aus der sich der heutige evangelische Johanniterorden entwickelte, nahm schon im Mittelalter eine Sonderstellung innerhalb des deutschen Großpriorats und des Gesamtordens ein. Dadurch überdauerte sie die Reformation und blieb bis zum 19. Jahrhundert, auch wenn nur lose eingebunden, im Gesamtverband des Ordens.\n\n[EN] The Bailiwick of Brandenburg, which has been documented since 1351 and from which today’s Protestant Order of Saint John developed, already occupied a special position within the German Grand Priory and the Order as a whole in the Middle Ages. As a result, it survived the Reformation and remained part of the Order as a whole until the 19th century, even if only loosely integrated.\n\nOfficial website Johanniterorden\n\nComment\n\nToday, the Order of Saint John (with the full name Bailiwick Brandenburg of the Knightly Order of Saint John of the Hospital of Jerusalem) is a Protestant religious community that claims to have emerged in 1538 from the Bailiwick Brandenburg of the Knightly Order of Saint John or Hospitallers, which in turn can be traced back to the original Hospital of Saint John.\n\nIn Germany, the Bailiwick of Brandenburg had already had a largely autonomous status since the Treaty of Heimbach (1382). After the conversion of the Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg to Lutheranism in 1538, this branch became Protestant (Wedekind, 1853).\n\nIn the Peace of Tilsit, Prussia committed itself to high payments to Napoleon. By edict of 30 October 1810 and deed of 23 January 1811, King Frederick William III therefore confiscated the possessions of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg and the associated commendations:\n\nEdikt über die Einziehung sämmtlicher geistlicher Güter in der Monarchie\n\nvom 30. Oktober 1810\n\nWir Friedrich Wilhelm, von Gottes Gnaden König von Preußen\n\nIn Erwägung daß\n\na. die Zwecke, wozu geistliche Stifter und Klöster bisher errichtet wurden, theils mit den Ansichten und Bedürfnissen der Zeit nicht vereinbar sind, theils auf veränderte Weise besser erreicht werden können;\n\nb. daß alle benachbarte Staaten die gleichen Maasregeln ergriffen haben;\n\nc. daß die pünktliche Abzahlung der Contribution an Frankreich nur dadurch möglich wird;\n\nd. daß Wir dadurch die ohnedies sehr großen Anforderungen an das Privat-Vermögen Unserer getreuen Unterthanen ermäßigen, verordnen Wir wie folgt:\n\n§. 1. Alle Klöster, Dom- und andere Stifter, Balleyen und Commenden, sie mögen zur katholischen oder protestantischen Religion gehören, werden von jetzt an als Staats-Güter betrachtet.\n\n§ 2. Alle Klöster, Dom- und andere Stifter, Balleyen und Commenden sollen nach und nach eingezogen und für Entschädigung der Benutzer und Berechtigten soll gesorgt werden.\n\n§ 3. Vom Tage dieses Edicts an, dürfen\n\na. keine Anwartschaften ertheilt, keine Novizen aufgenommen und Niemand in den Besitz einer Stelle gesetzt werden;\n\nb. ohne Unsere Genehmigung keine Veränderungen der Substanz vorgenommen werden;\n\nc. keine Capitalien eingezogen, keine Schulden kontrahirt, oder die Inventarien veräußert werden;\n\nd. keine neue Pacht-Contracte ohne Unsere Genehmigung geschlossen, keine ältere verlängert werden.\n\nAlle gegen diese Vorschriften unternommene Handlungen sind nichtig.\n\n§ 4. Wir werden für hinreichende Belohnung der obersten geistlichen Behörden und mit dem Rathe derselben für reichliche Dotirung der Pfarreien, Schulen, milden Stiftungen und selbst derjenigen Klöster sorgen, welche sich mit der Erziehung der Jugend und der Krankenpflege beschäftigen und welche durch obige Vorschriften entweder an ihren bisherigen Einnahmen leiden oder deren durchaus neue Fundirung nöthig erscheinen dürfte.\n\n[EN] Edict on the confiscation of all ecclesiastical property in the Monarchy\n\nof 30 October 1810\n\nWe Frederick William, by the Grace of God King of Prussia\n\nWhereas\n\na. the purposes for which ecclesiastical foundations and monasteries have hitherto been established are partly incompatible with the views and needs of the time, and partly can be better achieved in a different way;\n\nb. that all neighbouring states have adopted the same rules of measure;\n\nc. that the punctual payment of the contribution to France is only made possible by this;\n\nd. that We thereby reduce the already very great demands on the private property of Our faithful subjects, We decree as follows:\n\n§1. all monasteries, cathedrals and other foundations, bailiwicks and communes, whether they belong to the Catholic or Protestant religion, shall henceforth be regarded as State property.\n\n§ All monasteries, cathedrals and other foundations, bailiwicks and communes shall be gradually confiscated and compensation shall be provided for the users and beneficiaries.\n\n§ 3. from the day of this edict, the following shall not be permitted\n\na. no entitlements shall be granted, no novices shall be admitted, and no one shall be placed in possession of a position;\n\nb. no alterations of the substance may be made without Our permission;\n\nc. no capital may be collected, no debts contracted, or inventories sold;\n\nd. no new lease contracts shall be concluded without Our permission, and no older ones shall be renewed.\n\nAll actions taken in contravention of these provisions shall be null and void.\n\n§ 4. We shall see to it that the highest ecclesiastical authorities are sufficiently rewarded and, with their advice, that the parishes, schools, charitable foundations and even those monasteries which are concerned with the education of the young and the care of the sick and which, as a result of the above provisions, either suffer from their present income or whose entirely new foundation may appear necessary.\n\nPreußische Gesetzsammlung 1810, S. 32. Ernst Rudolf Huber, Dokumente zur deutschen Verfassungsgeschichte Band 1, Verlag Kohlhammer.\n\nThe King, however, wanted to suspend the execution of the aforementioned edict of 30 October 1810 for the Order of Saint John as long as his great-uncle, the Master of the Order, Prince August Ferdinand, whom he held in high esteem, was still alive. The Prince, who was 81 years old, declared that “for the sake of example and duty to the state, I do not wish to make use of this Royal Grace“. He obtained the consent of the chapter of the Order, and as early as 31 December 1810, an agreement, a recess, was reached between the commissioners of the state, the representatives of the Crown, and those of the Order, in which the detailed conditions of the transfer of the Bailiwick’s property to the state were determined. The Herrenmeister approved this recess by means of a “Cessions- und Verzichtsacte auf das Meisterthum Sonnenburg und die davon abhängigen Commenden” (Cession and Renunciation Act on the Master’s Estate of Sonnenburg and its Dependent Commands) issued on 12 January 1811. The King, for his part, was informed of this and issued an “Acceptance and Insurance Act” on 23 January 1811 and sent the thus executed recession with a handwritten letter to Prince August Ferdinand, in which he thanked him for his willingness to accept the recession (see: Die Säkularisation der Ballei Brandenburg im Jahre 1811 – Ende oder Weiterbestand in anderer Struktur, s.d. s.l.).\n\nOn 23 May 1812, King Frederick William III endowed the Royal Prussian Order of Saint John as an award for honourable service, as proof of royal grace and in memory of the dissolved Bailiwick Brandenburg. In the formation charter he clearly declared that the Order was abolished:\n\nWir bestätigen durch Unsere gegenwärtige Urkunde diese gänzliche Auflösung der Ballei Brandenburg des Johanniter-Ordens, des Herrenmeisterthums und der Commenden derselben, sowie die Einziehung der sämtlichen Güter des Herrenmeisterthums und der Commenden dieser Ballei als Staatsgüter; wollen und verordnen, dass es bei dieser gänzlichen Auflösung, Erlöschung und Einziehung in allen Folgezeiten verbleiben soll.\n\n[EN] We confirm by our present document this complete dissolution of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Order of Saint John, of the Herrenmeisterthum and the Commenden thereof, as well as the confiscation of all the properties of the Herrenmeisterthum and the Commenden of this Bailiwick as state properties; we want and decree that this complete dissolution, extinction and confiscation shall remain in all subsequent times.\n\nAbschnitt II:\n\n[EN] Section II:\n\nDagegen errichten Wir hiermit, zu einem ehrenvollen Andenken der nunmehr aufgelösten und erloschenen Ballei des St. Johanniter-Ordens, einen neuen Orden in der Eigenschaft und unter der Benennung: Königlich Preußischer St. Johanniter-Orden, welcher von nun an zu Unseren Königlich Preußischen Orden gehören soll.“\n\n[EN] On the other hand, for the honourable memory of the now dissolved and extinct Bailiwick of the Order of Saint John, We hereby establish a new Order in the capacity and under the name: Royal Prussian Order of Saint John, which shall from now on belong to Our Royal Prussian Orders.\n\nGelbke, pp. 36-37.\n\nBy cabinet order of 15 October 1852, King Frederick William IV of Prussia formally restored the Bailiwick, but without restoring its previous possessions. The holders of the Order of Merit automatically became members of the restored Bailiwick . On 17 May 1853, Prince Carl of Prussia was installed as Master of the Order and announced his election as well as the revival of the Bailiwick directly to the Governor of the Grand Magisterium of the Order of Malta in Rome. The Grand Priory of Germany had ceased to exist in 1811 and the Order as a whole had no Grand Master between 1805 and 1879, but only a Governor ruling in his place. In a letter to the “Bailiwick Brandenburg of the Sovereign Order of St. John in Jerusalem” by the Governor of the Order of Malta Fra’ Philipp von Colloredo-Mels, this was noted, but any determination regarding the legal status of the Bailiwick was avoided (Wedekind, 1853; Herrlich 1886).\n\nIn the 1760’s, King Frederick the Great, as well as his Catholic counterpart, Grand Master Pinto de Fonseca tried to merge the Orders to an integral body. Ferdinand von Hompesch, later the last Grand Master to rule on Malta, was the mediator between the two. The Pope, however, insisted on his view that the Bailiwick, as a heretical organisation, could not be part of the Order. Therefore, the original German Johanniterorden was formed in 1538, dissolved in 1810 and revived in 1852, the formation year of the modern Balley Brandenburg des Ritterlichen Ordens Sankt Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem. Its claim, that it was formed in 1351 is unjustified.\n\nJohanniter Orde (The Netherlands)\n\nDe Johanniter Orde is een Ridderlijke Orde met een protestants-christelijke grondslag. De Orde is in 1099 gesticht als de Ridderlijke Orde van het Hospitaal van Sint Jan en heeft dan ook een rijke historie. Het lidmaatschap is voorbehouden aan diegenen, die tot de Nederlandse adel behoren en voldoen aan de voorwaarden die de Orde aan het lidmaatschap stelt.\n\nThe Johanniter Order is a Knightly Order with a Protestant-Christian foundation. The Order was founded in 1099 as the Knightly Order of the Hospital of St. John and therefore has a rich history. Membership is reserved for those who belong to the Dutch nobility and who meet the conditions for membership set by the Order.\n\nOfficial website of the Johanniter Orde\n\nComment\n\nA Johanniter Order branch of the German Johanniter Order in The Netherlands was formed in 1909 as a division of the aforementioned German Balley Brandenburg.\n\nPrins Hendrik koestert het plan om de middeleeuwse orde in Nederland te doen herleven. Is de orde hier te lande dan dood? Nee, er zijn nog altijd Nederlandse Johanniter ridders. Van oudsher is de orde in deze contreien gevestigd geweest, met talrijke bezittingen her en der. Van een levende Nederlandse organisatie is echter geen sprake. Ten tijde van de Republiek zijn de bezittingen deels door de overheid overgenomen en deels in handen van de ordeheren gelaten. Zij blijft in naam bestaan, maar na 1795 is nauwelijks sprake meer van een reële Johanniter aanwezigheid. In het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden is de orde verdwenen. De ridders anno 1909 maken, net als de prins zelf, deel uit van de Duitse tak van de Johanniter Orde, de zogenoemde Balije Brandenburg, en die is sinds de reformatie een zelfstandige, los van het oude ordecentrum opererende instelling voor protestantse edellieden. Ook Nederlandse edellieden worden toegelaten tot het lidmaatschap: sommige families onderhouden al sinds generaties een band met de orde. De prins wil een Nederlands verband van Johanniter ridders tot stand brengen, een eigen Nederlandse afdeling oprichten die mogelijk, net als in Duitsland, een moderne invulling kan geven aan de oude ridderlijke opdracht. Op 22 februari 1909 organiseert hij op paleis Noordeinde een maaltijd voor de Nederlandse Johanniter ridders met de bedoeling hen ‘nauwer aan elkaar te verbinden’. Hierop volgen besprekingen die leiden tot de eenstemmig uitgesproken wens een Nederlandse afdeling op te richten, liefst onder leiding van de prins. Deze is hiertoe bereid en vertrekt enkele dagen later met twee rechtsridders, jonkheer P.O.H. Gevaerts van Simonshaven en G.D.C. d’Aumale baron van Hardenbroek, naar Berlijn om te onderzoeken of daar bezwaren tegen het voornemen bestaan.\n\n[EN[ Prince Henry nurtures the plan to revive the medieval order in The Netherlands. So is the order dead here in the country? No, there are still Dutch Johanniter knights. From time immemorial, the order has been based in these parts, with numerous possessions here and there. However, there is no question of a living Dutch organisation. At the time of the Republic, the possessions were partly taken over by the government and partly left in the hands of the order lords. It continues to exist in name, but after 1795 there is hardly any real Johanniter presence. In the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the order disappeared. The knights anno 1909, like the prince himself, are part of the German branch of the Johanniter Order, the so-called Bailiwick Brandenburg, and this has been an independent institution for Protestant noblemen, operating separately from the old order centre, since the Reformation. Dutch noblemen are also admitted to membership: some families have maintained ties with the order for generations. The prince wants to create a Dutch connection of Johanniter knights, to establish his own Dutch branch that could possibly, like in Germany, give a modern interpretation to the old chivalric order. On 22 February 1909, he organises a dinner at Noordeinde Palace for the Dutch Johanniter knights with the intention of ‘linking them more closely together’. This is followed by discussions leading to the unanimously expressed wish to establish a Dutch section, preferably under the prince’s leadership. The prince was willing to do so and a few days later left for Berlin with two knights justice, Jonkheer P.O.H. Gevaerts van Simonshaven and G.D.C. d’Aumale baron van Hardenbroek, to investigate whether there were any objections to the plan.\n\nDe Grootmeester, prins Eitel Friedrich van Pruisen, verklaart mede namens de koning van Pruisen, protector van de orde, dat de oprichting van zo’n afdeling ‘met grote ingenomenheid zou worden begroet’. Ook wordt bezien of van Nederlandse zijde misschien bezwaren gemaakt worden. Integendeel, de minister van Justitie, Mr. A.P.L. Nelissen, geeft de verzekering ‘alles in het werk te zullen stellen, om de oprichting der afdeeling […] te helpen vergemakkelijken’. Er worden statuten ontworpen en op 22 mei 1909 vindt in Den Haag een tweede bijeenkomst (met maaltijd, à f 15 per persoon) plaats, nu in paleis Kneuterdijk. Inmiddels heeft de geboorte van een troonopvolgster plaatsgevonden – Nederland viert opgelucht feest. Ook de vijftien ten paleize verzamelde Johanniter ridders zijn ongetwijfeld opgetogen; zij besluiten bij acclamatie tot oprichting van een Nederlandse afdeling, oftewel Commenderij. Prins Hendrik wordt eveneens bij acclamatie tot Commendator gekozen. Het Kapittel te Duitsland stemt op 8 juli 1909 in met de oprichting, de statuten worden goedgekeurd bij Koninklijk Besluit van 31 juli 1909, en er wordt een convent gekozen. Op 28 oktober keurt de Koningin bij Koninklijk Besluit de benoeming van de prins tot Commendator goed. Als officiële stichtingsdatum wordt 30 april 1909, de geboortedag van prinses Juliana, aangehouden.\n\n[EN] The Grand Master, Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia, declares, also on behalf of the King of Prussia, protector of the order, that the establishment of such a section would be ‘greeted with great welcome’. It also considers whether objections might be raised from the Dutch side. On the contrary, the Minister of Justice, Mr A.P.L. Nelissen, gives the assurance that ‘everything possible will be done to help facilitate the establishment of the section’. Statutes are drafted and a second meeting (with meal, at f 15 per person) is held in The Hague on 22 May 1909, this time at the Kneuterdijk Palace. Meanwhile, the birth of an heir to the throne has taken place – The Netherlands celebrates with relief. The fifteen Johanniter knights gathered at the palace are undoubtedly delighted too; they decide by acclamation to establish a Dutch branch, or Commenderij. Prince Henry is also elected Commendator by acclamation. The Chapter in Germany approves the establishment on 8 July 1909, the statutes are approved by Royal Decree of 31 July 1909, and a convent is elected. On 28 October, the Queen by Royal Decree approves the Prince’s appointment as Commendator. The official founding date is 30 April 1909, Princess Juliana’s birthday.\n\nDe koninklijke handtekeningen markeren een opmerkelijke wedergeboorte. Want zo vanzelfsprekend is het niet, dat een dergelijk aristocratisch instituut in Nederland nieuw leven wordt ingeblazen. De prins mag hieraan behoefte hebben, of anderen in Nederland ook in die mate van nut en noodzaak overtuigd zijn, is nog maar de vraag.\n\n[EN] The royal signatures mark a remarkable rebirth. For it is not so obvious that such an aristocratic institution should be revived in the Netherlands. The prince may feel a need for it, but whether others in The Netherlands are convinced of its usefulness and necessity to this extent remains to be seen.\n\nBruin, K. (2006). Duitse connecties: De heroprichting van de Johanniter Orde in Nederland. Virtus, 13, 132-133.\n\nThe schism between the German mother Order and the division in The Netherlands took place in 1946:\n\nZolang de prins [Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden, JvBQ] leeft – en dat is tot juli 1934 – blijft de band van de Nederlandse Commenderij met ‘Duitsland’ onverminderd in stand. Ook de band met de voormalige koning van Pruisen blijft in stand. Op de ridderdagen zenden de ridders blijken van aanhankelijkheid naar de Protector van de Balije Brandenburg, nu te Doorn, en deze zendt prins Hendrik in de tweede persoon enkelvoud gestelde telegrammen om te bedanken. Na het overlijden van de laatste blijft het bestuur van de Nederlandse afdeling vertegenwoordigers naar kapittelvergaderingen in Berlijn sturen, tot in 1939 aan toe. Men heeft wel degelijk oog voor wat er in Duitsland gaande is, maar de verbondenheid met de organisatie aldaar blijft zwaar wegen. Er is een tweede wereldoorlog voor nodig om de door sommigen al lang gewenste afscheiding een feit te laten worden. De statuten worden gewijzigd, de naam wordt gewijzigd in die van St.-Jan, en er gaat in mei 1946 een brief van het kapittel naar prins Oscar van Pruisen, Herrenmeister te Potsdam, waarin gesteld wordt ‘daß nach all demjenigen das unser Land und Volk erfahren haben müssen und in Erwägung der Stellungnahme seitens der Führung der Balley Brandenburg, es unmöglich für uns ist, weiter Teil der Balley auszumachen’. Het partijkiezen van de Duitse broeders voor de nazi-machthebbers, bijvoorbeeld blijkend uit een felicitatie aan het adres van de Führer wegens de goede afloop van de veldtocht tegen Polen, wordt hun voor de voeten geworpen. Op 2 juli volgt een bevestigingsbrief uit Duitsland, waaruit niet alleen teleurstelling maar ook verontwaardiging spreekt. De ‘politisch-irdische’ gezichtspunten hebben gezegevierd boven de ‘christlich-göttlichen’, die toch bij de internationale christelijke organisatie als die van de Johanniters de voorrang zouden moeten hebben. Kennelijk hebben de heren in Holland niet de moeite genomen zich echt te verdiepen in wat de Duitse Johanniters tegen het nationaal-socialisme gedaan en daardoor geleden hebben, anders zou het oordeel wel anders uitgevallen zijn.\n\n[EN] As long as the prince [Prince Henry of The Netherlands, JvBQ] lives – and that is until July 1934 – the Dutch Commendery’s ties with ‘Germany’ remain undiminished. The link with the former King of Prussia also remains intact. On the Knights’ Days, the knights send expressions of affection to the Protector of the Brandenburg Bailiwick, now at Doorn, and the latter sends Prince Henry telegrams in the second person singular to thank him. After the death of the latter, the board of the Dutch section continues to send representatives to chapter meetings in Berlin, until 1939. One does have an eye for what is going on in Germany, but the attachment to the organisation there continues to weigh heavily. It takes a Second World War for the withdrawal long desired by some to become a reality. The statutes are amended, the name is changed to that of St John’s, and a letter from the chapter goes to Prince Oscar of Prussia, Herrenmeister at Potsdam, in May 1946, stating ‘daß nach all demjenigen das unser Land und Volk erfahren haben müssen und in Erwägung der Stellungnahme seitens der Führung der Balley Brandenburg, es unmöglich für uns ist, weiter Teil der Balley auszumachen’. The German brethren’s partisanship of the Nazi rulers, as evidenced, for example, by a congratulatory letter to the Führer on account of the good outcome of the campaign against Poland, is thrown their way. A letter of confirmation from Germany followed on 2 July, expressing not only disappointment but also indignation. The ‘politisch-irdische’ views have triumphed over the ‘christlich-göttlichen’, which should have priority in the international Christian organisation like that of the Johannites. Apparently, the gentlemen in Holland did not bother to really delve into what the German Johanniters did against National Socialism and suffered as a result, otherwise the verdict would have been different.\n\nBruin, K. (2006). Duitse connecties: De heroprichting van de Johanniter Orde in Nederland. Virtus, 13, 139-140.\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. It is questionable that the Dutch division of the German Order waited until 1946 to hypocritically distance themselves from the Germans. Especially, since at that moment it must have been known to them that a number of German members of the Order of Saint John had been executed in connection with the assassination attempt on Hitler:\n\nAlexander von Falkenhausen\n\nHeinrich Graf zu Dohna-Schlobitten (Rechtsritter)\n\nAlbrecht von Hagen (Ehrenritter)\n\nUlrich von Hassell (Rechtsritter)\n\nEwald von Kleist-Schmenzin (Rechtsritter)\n\nFritz von der Lancken (Ehrenritter)\n\nWilhelm Graf zu Lynar (Rechtsritter)\n\nFriedrich von Rabenau (Rechtsritter)\n\nAdolf Friedrich Graf von Schack (Rechtsritter)\n\nFriedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg (Rechtsritter),\n\nUlrich Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von Schwanenfeld (Rechtsritter)\n\nErwin von Witzleben (Rechtsritter)\n\nWhy did the withdrawal not take place in 1939?\n\nThe website statement by the Johanniter Order in The Netherlands regarding their origin is untruthful and misleads the public, from which it obtains donations. The Order was newly formed in 1947, not in 1099. It is dishonest that JO-member Jonkheer Dr. Tom Versélewel de Witt Hamer (alias: Iliwapcot) tries to camouflage this fact on Wikipedia by replacing the original, more or less correct article-version by a version that hides the 1947 formation date:\n\nJohanniterorden i Sverige\n\nThe Swedish Order of Saint John claims to be formed in 1080:\n\nJohanniterorden grundades i Jerusalem år 1080 för att ge sjukvård och erbjuda härbärge åt pilgrimer. Ordens syfte var då, liksom i dag, humanitärt.\n\nThe Order of St. John was founded in Jerusalem in 1080 to provide medical care and shelter for pilgrims. The purpose of the Order was then, as today, humanitarian.\n\nOfficial website Johanniterorden i Sverige\n\nIn April 1920 the Swedish Order of Saint John was formed as a Swedish association with Count Walther von Hallwyl as its Commendator. The association was affiliated with the aforementioned Order of Saint John in Germany. After the end of World War II, the Swedish Order separated itself from the German Order. Therefore, the Swedish Order of Saint John was formed in 1920, instead of 1080. In November 1946, it was granted a Royal Charter by King Gustav V as the Johanniterorden i Sverige (Scheffer, 1970). King Carl XVI Gustav is the current High Patron, and Queen Silvia is the First Honorary Member of the Order.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn 1798, Napoleon abolished the Order of Malta, which was revived in 1879 by the Pope. In 1811, the King of Prussia initiated the “complete dissolution, extinction and confiscation” of the German Order of Saint John. This branch was revived in 1852. The British Order of Saint John was formed in 1876. The Swedish and Dutch Orders of Saint John were formed 1920 and 1946 respectively. Thus, the current Orders of Saint John are19th and 20th century revivals which use the badge and name of the ancient Hospitaller Order, without a substantial historical link. Royal nor Papal approval can change the historical truth.\n\nThe aforementioned Orders of Saint John are major international charities which provide crucial first aid, health care and support services around the world. Many donors have contributed essential financial and volunteer support. They have made choices regarding the beneficiary of their money, e.g. between the Order of Saint John and the Red Cross. It cannot be ruled out that many donors have chosen the Order of Saint John because of their illustrious history, as presented on their websites. Therefore, honesty regarding the formation date is not only important from a historical, but also from a financial perspective. A charitable organization may not misrepresent its nature. A misrepresentation may be accomplished by words or conduct or failure to disclose material facts. The narrative that an Order was formed in the 11th century to add more credibility to the organisation, instead of telling a potential donor that the Order is a nineteenth century revival, can be seen as misrepresentation. It gets even worse when an Order spends money from donations on lawsuits to fight competing charities instead of helping the sick and poor, as promoted in its publications.\n\nLiterature\n\nScicluna, J.

Reimer.\n\nAppendix 1a\n\nTHE ALLIANCE OF ORDERS OF THE HOSPITAL OF ST JOHN OF JERUSALEM\n\nThe Alliance of Orders of St John – a federation of the official primarily Protestant Orders of St John in Europe – was formed in 1961, on the initiative of then Swiss Commander, Baron M R von Sturler. The Convention of the Alliance of Knightly Orders of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem was signed in Nieder-Weisel on 13 June 1961 by representatives of the Orders of St John in Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden. Also affiliated to the Alliance are the Commanderies in Finland, France, Switzerland and Hungary, which are all linked with the Bailiwick of Brandenburg. [see Annex A]\n\nThe main purpose behind the creation of the Alliance was to strengthen the international standing of the Protestant Orders of St John in Europe and to facilitate a united front in matters of common concern. During the Second World War, Baron von Sturler, from his neutral but key position as Commander in Bern, had been in close contact with the various Orders of St John and their individual members, as well as with the Sovereign Order of Malta. That co-operation continued after the war; but it then proved increasingly difficult for the members of the Orders of St John, with their limited resources, to make a significant contribution among the many rapidly expanding international aid organisations with similar aims of their own, many of which had their headquarters in Geneva. The idea was thus born of forming an Alliance of the various official non-Catholic Orders of St John, as a first stage towards wider international co-operation in the future.\n\nA second reason why such an Association was thought necessary during the post-war era was the growth of illegitimate, or unrecognised, Orders claiming the same historical background as the four official Orders of St John and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. A number of these unrecognised Orders had been formed after World War II, some in the USA and spreading from there to Europe. This was source of irritation and confusion.\n\nWhen the Alliance of Orders of St John was formed, therefore, its main tasks were defined as first, to spread knowledge of the purpose, organisation and activities of the Alliance and its member Orders; and secondly, to keep a close watch on, and if necessary counteract, the negative effects resulting from confusion with any Unrecognised Order.\n\nThis led the Alliance to publish in 1964 the forerunner of this booklet. It aimed briefly to describe not only the history of the Alliance members, but also to give some idea of the nature and scope of their practical charitable activities. These were especially important in Britain and Germany, where the respective Orders occupy somewhat the same position as, for example, the Red Cross does in Sweden. Most of the members of the Alliance have it in common, that they concentrate mainly on national charitable activities, and have only limited funds available for international projects. There are certain major exceptions to this, however. First, the (London-based) Venerable Order of St John has a major eye hospital in Jerusalem where the German Order also runs a general hospital. Secondly, because of its world-wide network described above, the Venerable Order has significant activities outside Europe in the older Commonwealth countries and also does further work (e.g. in First Aid training and Primary Healthcare) in some 30 developing countries in the Commonwealth where it has branches. Several of its Priories also undertake First Aid training in other countries such as Japan, Jordan and Mexico. Thirdly, the Johanniter Unfall Hilfe in Germany now has a significant aid programme abroad, in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and elsewhere.\n\nAt a subsequent meeting in Bubikon in 1964, it was decided to open a permanent secretariat for the Alliance in Geneva. Its original aim was to co-ordinate international activities; and to organise the necessary contact with the Sovereign Order of Malta, the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN humanitarian and social agencies, as well as other organisations, in that city.\n\nAt the Alliance Meeting in London held in 1967, it was decided to make the following addition to the information contained in the first (1964) booklet about the Alliance Orders of St John.\n\nOnly the member Orders of the Alliance of Orders of St John, and the Sovereign Order of Malta (whose headquarters are in Rome) are recognised by the Alliance as historically legitimate Orders of St John.\n\nNo other Orders, associations or organisations shall in future be recognised as Orders of St John without consultation of and a unanimous resolution by all members of the Alliance of Orders of St John.\n\nThis remains the firm policy of the Alliance.\n\nFinally, an historic declaration was circulated on 14 October 1987, and was signed by the four Orders of the Alliance as a joint declaration with the Grand Master of the (Roman Catholic) Sovereign Military Order of Malta. This formally confirmed the status of the five official Orders of St John. The text is at Annex B.\n\nThe Council of the Alliance meets annually, usually in the country of one of its members. There are also regular co-ordination meetings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta at various different levels.\n\nThe “False Orders Committee” is an independent Committee, established by the initiative of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1974. The four recognised Orders of St John in the Alliance are represented on this Committee. In the context of the wider scene of unrecognised orders of Chivalry, the FOC is charged with preventing the misuse of the names, emblems and official documents of its Member Orders, and to forestall unlawful acts arising from the imitation of those names and emblems. In addition to, but separate from, the False Orders Committee, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Orders of the Alliance of St John have constituted a Joint Commission on Emblem Protection. This seeks to prevent unauthorised use of the white eight-pointed cross.\n\nANNEX A – Convention signed in Niederweisel on the 13th June 1961\n\nTwo years later, on 26 November 1963, the Alliance was consolidated with the signing of a joint declaration between the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Most Venerable Order, at St John’s Gate, London, by the Grand Chancellor of the SMHOM, the Prince of Resuttano, and Lord Wakehurst, Lord Prior of the Most Venerable Order. The text of this document reads:\n\nThe relationship which exists between the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta and the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem is not always clearly understood, and it is to dispel any misconceptions which may exist that this statement is being made.\n\nA dispute, long since relegated to the realms of academic discussion, as to whether the Most Venerable Order was the lineal descendent of the old Grand Priory of the Sovereign Order, at one time caused division amongst those concerned with such questions. Certain it is that the Most Venerable Order acquired a completely independent existence when it was granted a Royal Charter by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, who became its Sovereign Head.\n\nSince this time the Most Venerable Order has pursued the same high ideals of charity, especially to the poor and sick, which were the very cause of the foundation of the Sovereign Order nearly one thousand years ago.\n\nIt will be easy to understand, therefore, why two great Orders, representing the same traditions, pursuing the same ideals, serving the same cause and wearing the same famous eight pointed cross, should have the greatest respect and esteem for each other. It is our great happiness to declare that such a relationship does truly exist, and that it is the dearest wish of both Orders, to seek ever more ways in which they can collaborate, to promote God’s glory and to alleviate the sufferings and miseries of mankind.\n\nTo supplement this statement, a further agreement was drawn up between the SMHOM and the Venerable Order in 1983. This was signed by Sir Maurice Dorman, Lord Prior of the Most Venerable Order and Sir Peter Hope, KCMG, then President of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order. It reads as follows:\n\nTwenty years have passed since the signing of the Joint Declaration concerning the relationship between the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Most Venerable Order of St. John, during which the relationship between our two Orders has grown ever closer.\n\nIn it the common ideal of the struggle in the defense of our suffering brethren was affirmed and the amity between the signatory Orders was acclaimed especially the common wearing of the eight-pointed Cross of St. John.\n\nThe last two decades have seen an increase in the world-wide suffering of our brethren, our response has likewise expanded. The banner of our eight-pointed Cross has been flown increasingly where-ever in the world sickness or distress have made demands upon us. Our ties are strong and our purpose to help Our Lords the Sick identical. We are pleased to record our joint efforts to help the elderly which have already seen the creation of Alms Houses in Sussex and Wales.\n\nWe are also united in one fight against False Orders, those self constituted and self styled groups which lack both authenticity or legitimacy of origin but variously describe themselves as an “Order of St. John” or an “Order of Malta”. However the Johanniter Orden in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands is a legitimate and honoured ally.\n\nWe pledge ourselves anew to carry into the Twentyfirst Century the historical aims and obligations of our Orders.\n\nThe most recent agreement between the five Orders culminated in a further statement which clarifies the difference between those Orders which are recognized as such by the Sovereign authorities of the countries in which they are based and the self-styled “Orders of Saint John” whose pretension to be Orders of Chivalry are unrecognized by such sovereign authorities. Confirming the close and friendly relations between the five Orders, this statement reads as follows:\n\nANNEX B – Joint Declaration dated 14 October 1987.\n\nTHE ORDERS OF SAINT JOHN With the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is Roman Catholic, the four non-Catholic Orders of St. John provide a Christian answer to the problems of a troubled and materialistic world. They have a common devotion to a historical tradition and a unique vocation: the lordship of the sick and the poor. They strive to realize their aim by mutual collaboration as well as by their own works. They are the only Orders of St. John which may legitimately use that name.\n\nThe Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem had its origins in Jerusalem in the late eleventh century and was recognized as an Order by Pope Pascal II in 1113. From that date it was a religious Order. Its members took monastic vows and lived according to a religious rule.\n\nIn the course of its history it developed a class of knights who took no vows, while knights belonging to the first class continued to be professed religious. The Order, therefore, uniquely combined and still combines within itself the nature of a religious Order and an Order of chivalry. In the former capacity it was and still is subject to the laws of the Church. The Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta (generally known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta) is this Order. It is widely recognized as a sovereign subject of International Public Law. It has five Grand Priories, three Sub-Priories and thirty-seven National Associations throughout catholic Christendom. Since 1834 its extra-territorial headquarters have been in Rome. The Grand Master is H.M.E.H. Fra’ Angelo de Mojana di Cologna.\n\nFour non-catholic Orders of St. John of Jerusalem are recognized by their sovereign authorities in the countries in which they are based.\n\nThey are: Die Balley Brandenburg des Ritterlichen Ordens Sankt Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem (generally known as Der Johanniterorden). Besides seventeen Associations in the Federal Republic of Germany, there are Austrian, Finnish, French and Swiss (which are officially recognized in their respective countries) and the Hungarian in exile. Its Headquarters are in Bonn. Its head, styled Der Herrenmeister, is H.R.H. Prince Wilhelm-Karl of Prussia.\n\nJohanniter Orde in Nederland. It was formed as an independent Order in 1946. Its headquarters are in the Hague. Its head is H.R.H. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Johanniterorden i Sverige. It was incorporated by royal charter in 1946. Its headquarters are in Stockholm and the High Patron is H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf.\n\nThe Grand Priory of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem (generally known as the Order of St. John). It has six Priories, two Commanderies and forty Saint John Councils throughout the English-speaking world. Its headquarters are in London. Its Sovereign Head is H.M. Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe four non-Catholic Orders are associated with one another in the international Alliance of the Orders of St. John of Jerusalem. They are Orders of Chivalry, but they are to be distinguished from most national Orders because of their Christian faith and their traditions as religious confraternities of Christian laymen.\n\nIn all these Orders are fostered such ideals of the medieval Order as are applicable to their circumstances, essentially the care of the sick and other service to fellow men.\n\n14 October 1987.

All Orders of St. John to-day are dedicated, according to their various Constitutions, to the Christian faith and to the work of caring for the sick and needy. The fulfillment of these tasks is largely exemplified in the establishment and operation of hospitals, welfare institutions, nursing schools, first aid organizations and associations for social aid and care of the sick, and like institutions.\n\nII. The signatory Orders of St. John hereunder mentioned are akin to the older Tongues, respect the ancient rule and its underlying purpose, but are each of them free, independent and autonomous, and they now form an Alliance of Orders of St. John to be known by that description.\n\nThe signatory Orders of St. John are as follows:\n\nDie Balley Brandenburg des ritterlichen Ordens St. Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem\n\nThe Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem\n\nJohanniter Orde in Nederland\n\nJohanniterorden i Sverige\n\nWith these are to be counted the four Associations in union with the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, namely:\n\nJohanniter Ridderskap i Finland\n\nAssociation des Chevaliers de St. Jean, Langue de France\n\nGenossenschaft der Johanniterritter in der Schweiz\n\nJohannitarend Magyar Tagozata\n\nIII. The signatory Orders are firmly of the opinion that the unity of all Orders of St. John is demanded by history, by their faith and by their common purposes and will fortify their international standing, and that if their efforts and labours are to be effective on the international plane these should be carried on shoulder to shoulder and as a common task.\n\nIV. To enable all Orders of St. John to promote the success of the many international tasks which they undertake and with a view to facilitating also the co-ordination of their various activities, the establishment of a suitable joint committee and of a General Secretariat may be envisaged. The realization of this will only be effected by agreement between all Orders at the time members of the Alliance of Orders of St. John hereby established and if circumstances call for it or make it appear expedient. The organization, duties and powers of these bodies will be laid down by special regulations framed by agreement in the same way. In any case the members of this Alliance recognize that regular mutual contact is desirable.\n\nV. Other Orders, associations, or institutions recognized as Orders of St. John by all members of the said Alliance at the time may with the consent of all such members in like manner adhere to this Convention and become members of the said Alliance. &127 Any member of the Alliance of Orders of St. John may withdraw therefrom and from this Convention by giving six months notice in writing of that intention to all other members at the time.\n\nVII. The word “Alliance” used in the heading and text of this Convention has no political meaning and is not to be interpreted in the light of public international law, and no individual Sovereign person is intended to be bound or committed by this Convention.\n\nVIII. This Convention shall be drawn up in the English and German languages and the text in each language shall have equal validity. HEREBY AGREED AND SIGNED by the Orders mentioned in Article II at the meeting of their delegates held at the Commandery of Niederweisel on the 13th June 1961″.\n\nallianceofstjohn.org\n\nAppendix 2: Committee on the Orders of St John\n\nThe “Committee on the Orders of St John (FOC)“\n\nis an independent Committee, established by the initiative of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1974. The four recognised Orders of St John in the Alliance are represented on this Committee. In the context of the wider scene of unrecognised orders of Chivalry, the FOC is charged with preventing the misuse of the names, emblems and official documents of its Member Orders, and to forestall unlawful acts arising from the imitation of those names and emblems.\n\nIn September 2000, the FOC issued the following declaration, endorsed by members of the Alliance:\n\nSelf-Style Orders of St John\n\nThe Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, generally known as the Order of Malta, and the four Orders of St John of Jerusalem which co-operate in the Alliance of the Orders of St John are united by a common historical tradition and a unique vocation: the care of the sick and the poor. These Orders have established a joint committee to investigate and deal with the ever increasing number of organizations which misuse the symbols and emblems of the orders of St John, causing confusion in the minds of the public and impeding the welfare and hospitaller activities of the national and international bodies of the Order of Malta and of the Alliance Orders.\n\nThe Sovereign Order of Malta is unique in combining the nature of a Religious Order with an Order of Chivalry and is widely recognized as a sovereign entity of International Law. Confraternities were created after the Reformation which have legitimately conserved the institutional aims and emblems of the Order in their different Christian traditions and which the Sovereign Military Order of Malta recognizes.\n\nThe fours Order of St John of Jerusalem associated in the Alliance are recognized by the sovereign authorities in the countries in which they are based. Ther are:\n\nDie Balley Brandenburg des Ritterlichen Ordens Sankt Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem (Der Johanniterorden) based in Berlin, the head of which is H.R.H. Prince Oskar of Prussia.\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem based in London, the head of which is H.M. Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDe Johanniter Orde in Nederland based in The Hague, the Head of which was H.R.H. the late Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands; H.M Queen Beatrix is Commander of Honour.\n\nJohanniterorden i Sverige based in Stockholm, under the High Patronage of H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf.\n\nThe Orders of St John in the Alliance are Orders of Chivalry and are distinguished from other national Orders because of their Christian faith and their traditions as religious confraternities of Christian lay people.\n\nThe following addresses will be of use to those governmental and ecclesiastical authorities and private persons who wish for further information.Sovrano Militare Ordine di Malta\n\nGran Magistero\n\nVia Condotti 68\n\n00187 ROMA\n\nITALIA\n\nTel: +39.06.675811\n\nFax:+39.06.6797202\n\ne-mail: info@smominfo.org\n\n” Committee on the Orders of St John (FOC)”\n\nc/o Generalsekretariat des Johanniterordens\n\nFinkensteinallee 111\n\nD 12205 – BERLIN\n\nGERMANY\n\nPhone: +49 30 2309970 0\n\nFax: +49 30 2309970 249\n\nE-mail: johanniterorden@t-online.de\n\nSource: Official website of the Alliance\n\nAppendix 3: Member details\n\nADDRESSES OF MEMBER ORDERS OF THE ALLIANCE, AND THE MAIN COMMANDERIES (as of August 2001)\n\nShould you wish to learn more about the Alliance of Orders of St John, or its recognized members, you will find below a number of useful and official addresses.

A recommended starting point is Hospitallers: the History of the Order of St John by Professor Jonathan Riley-Smith; published in the UK by the Hambledon Press in 1999. At the end of it is a list of suggested further reading.\n\nSource: Official website of the Alliance\n\nAppendix 4\n\nAn Official Statement from the Chancellery of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, on the activities of organizations which falsely refer to themselves as the “Order of Malta”\n\nThe Chancellery of the Russian Imperial House occasionally receives inquiries from individuals and organizations about its relationship to groups that refer to themselves as the “Order of St. John of Jerusalem,” including so called “Orthodox” and “Russian” “Orders of Malta,” “Priories,” “Commanderies,” and so on.\n\nIn each such instance, it is necessary to clarify that no one has the legal right to use modified names or symbols of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta (hereinafter referred to as the Sovereign Order of Malta), which has a unquestionable historical and legal continuity from the moment of its founding, and which is recognized as a sovereign entity under international law, and which maintains diplomatic relations with more than 100 States around the world.\n\nThe Orthodox Russian Grand Priory was founded by Emperor Paul I in 1798 and was abolished by Emperor Alexander I in 1817. Since then no legitimate authority has reestablished it. Local attempts to revive its activities on a legal basis have not been successful, and all “Orthodox Order of St. John” organizations are illegitimate and offer a means of deception, including the trafficking in false “knighthoods.”\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes members of ancient Russian noble families, some of whose ancestors were members of the genuine Sovereign Order of Malta, have taken part (presumably out of ignorance or carelessness) in the activities of some of these pseudo-Order of Malta organizations. This is especially regrettable because it discredits historic traditional values, and damages the good name of these ancient families and the reputations of their descendants in Russia and the world over.\n\nTherefore, taking into account the long-standing historical and friendly relationship between the Russian Imperial House and the Sovereign Order of Malta, the Chancellery of the Head of the Russian Imperial House considers it necessary to provide the following detailed clarification of the legal and historical position of the Sovereign Order of Malta over the centuries.\n\nThe birth of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta dates back to 1048, when Merchants from the ancient Marine Republic of Amalfi obtained from the Caliph of Egypt the authorisation to build a church and monastery in Jerusalem in honour of St John the Baptist and Forerunner of God. In 1070, the Order built a hospice and hospital at their monastery of St. John for pilgrims coming to the Holy Land.\n\nIn 1113, during the tenure of the first Master, Blessed Gerard, Pope Paschal II placed the Order under the aegis of the Church, granting it the right freely to elect its superiors without interference from other lay or religious authorities. By virtue of the Papal Bull, the Hospital became a lay-religious order. The second Master, Raymond du Puy, transformed the originally monastic order into a religious military order. From this point on, the Order added a military role to its previous charitable and medical functions. Its members were pided into three categories: knights engaged in the military struggle to liberate the Lord’s Sepulchre, chaplains who performed religious services, and the brethren who ministered to the needs of pilgrims, the sick, the wounded, and so on.\n\nGradually, the Order of St. John, which enjoyed the special patronage of the Popes of Rome, grew in fame and became a wealthy and influential organization, owning properties in many Catholic countries of Europe. After the defeat of the Crusaders and the capture of Jerusalem in 1189 by Sultan Saladin, the seat of the Order of St. John moved to Acre, then to Cyprus in 1291, and then to the island of Rhodes in 1310. The members of the Order were then called the Knights of Rhodes. They fought against the Turks but, in the end, in 1522, during the tenure of Grand Master Philippe de Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, the knights were driven from Rhodes after a long and stubborn resistance against Sultan Suleiman II.\n\nIn 1530, Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain, gave the islands of Malta, Comino and Gozo to the Order of St. John. Since then, the members of the Order began to be called Knights of Malta, a name they continue to be known by to this day.\n\nDuring the Reformation, the Sovereign Order of Malta lost its possessions in those countries that adopted various forms of Protestantism (England, the Netherlands, and the nations of Scandinavia). But the greatest blow that fate delivered to the Sovereign Order of Malta was the loss of its citadel – the islands of Malta – and the threat to its very existence during the French Revolution and the subsequent revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in Europe. It was at this difficult moment that the Sovereign Order of Malta received life-sustaining support from the Russian Empire.\n\nRelations between the Knights of Malta and Russia existed even before the accession to the throne of the House of Romanoff, and diplomatic ties between Russia and Order were established during the reign of Peter I the Great.\n\nThe first contact between the two was in 1697, when the courtier (stol’nik) P. A. Tolstoi visited Malta to offer his congratulations to the newly-elected Grand Master, Ramon Perellos y Roccaful. In 1698, on instructions from Tsar Peter I, the boyar B. P. Sheremetev travelled through Europe in an attempt to form an alliance of Christian states against the Ottoman Empire, visiting Pope Innocent XII; the Doge of Venice, Silvestro Valiero; and other rulers, including Ramon Perellos y Roccaful of the Sovereign Order of Malta, who twice received Sheremetev in audience. In recognition of his respect for Russia, the Grand Master presented the tsar’s emissary with a diamond encrusted insignia of the Order of Malta, and so B. P. Sheremetev became the first Russian Orthodox honorary knight of the Roman Catholic Order of Malta.\n\nSince then, diplomatic relations between the Russian Empire and the Sovereign Order of Malta were maintained and continued to evolve. During the reign of Catherine II the Great, a military alliance was formed, though there were never at that time any directly coordinated military operations. Even so, Russian sailors trained on the Sovereign Order of Malta’s ships, and several knights of the Order volunteered to enter Russian service. Among these volunteers was the famous Count Giulio de Litta, who rose to the rank of a Russian Vice-Admiral and was awarded the Russian Order of St. George IV Class.\n\nIt was Count de Litta who led the Sovereign Order of Malta’s negotiations with Russia during the reign of Emperor Paul I, who ascended the throne after the death of his mother in 1796. Europe at that time was being rocked by war, which had broken out after the French Revolution in 1789. In 1792, the French National Convention deprived the Order of its properties inside France, which greatly depleted the Order’s resources. The knights of the Order turned to Russia for protection and patronage. In turn, the Emperor Paul I, who was enchanted by the romance of the chivalric order, became interested in the idea of creating out of the Sovereign Order of Malta an outpost of Christian civilization in Europe, which would stand in opposition to the spread of anti-Christian revolution. Filled with these lofty ideals, Paul I enthusiastically agreed to become the Order’s patron.\n\nOriginally, the idea was to create Priories in the Russian Empire to provide financial support for the Order, and to name the Russian emperor the patron of the Sovereign Order of Malta. In January 1797, a convention containing these provisions was signed.\n\nWhen, in 1798, the revolutionary army of France under the command of General Napoleon Bonaparte seized the island of Malta, Emperor Paul I was extremely outraged and offended. Given these circumstances, Paul I ordered the Russian naval squadron in the Mediterranean Sea, which was commanded by Admiral St. Feodor Feodorovich Ushakov, to “act in concert with the Turks and the English against the French, who are a violent race, and who have exterminated within the boundaries of their nation the Christian Faith and all laws established by God.” In this way, there arose the paradoxical situation where the defence of the Catholic Order of Malta was taken up, at least on the level of pleas and exhortations, by Russian Orthodox, English Protestants, and Muslim Turks, the last of these being most extraordinary given the fact that the Knights of Malta had for so many centuries fought against them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knights of Malta deposed Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, who had been ineffective as the Grand Master of the Order, and they decided on October 27, 1798, to recognize Paul I not only as Protector of the Order, but as its 72nd Grand Master.\n\nStrictly speaking, the election of the Orthodox and married Emperor Paul I as Grand Master of a Catholic Order, and the creation of an Orthodox Priory, contradict the Charter of the Order, which could be modified only with the approval of the Pope of Rome. These actions thus violated both the Order’s own internal laws and international law, and were only possible because of the extraordinary circumstances of a Europe that was plagued by revolution and war.\n\nOf course, these acts were entirely legal in the Russian Empire inasmuch as the Emperor holds the Supreme Power and is the very source of law. However, in order for the Sovereign Order of Malta to be able to continue its mission in the global arena, all these decisions had to be later recognized as legal on an international level.\n\nIt is possible that, through persistent diplomatic efforts, this international recognition would have been obtained in time, if not for the tragic death of Paul I and the subsequent reversal of his policy on the Sovereign Order of Malta by his son and successor, Emperor Alexander I.\n\nIn any case, Count Giulio de Litta was unable to convince Pope Pius VI and his advisors to recognize Emperor Paul I as Grand Master. The next Pope, Pius VII, who was elected in 1800, also refused to recognize Paul I’s election as Grand Master.\n\nNevertheless, on November 13, 1798, Emperor Paul I accepted the position of Grand Master, and on November 29, 1798, he added the Order of Malta to the Chapter of Russian Orders of Chivalry. Moreover, the insignia of the Order became part of Russia’s State symbols and began to be depicted on the State Coat of Arms and State Seal. Paul I intended to make the title of Grand Master hereditary in his own House, and he included it in the list of his full titles as Emperor of Russia.\n\nBoth Russian Priories of the Order – the Orthodox and Catholic ones – received significant properties in Russia, the incomes from which went to supporting the Order’s various activities. With the permission of the Emperor, the knights were permitted to establish noble (that is, hereditary) commanderies, the founders of which and their heirs were required to pay a tithe to the treasury of the Order. Persons not of the required ancient noble ancestry could become honorary commanders and knights of the Order, and others of common birth could be receive as Donats.\n\nFor a short period, the Order of Malta became the most prestigious order in the Russian Empire. But on March 11, 1801, Emperor Paul I fell victim to a conspiracy and was murdered. His son, Alexander I, issued a Manifesto on March 16, 1801, in which he took on the title of Protector of the Order and gave his permission for St. Petersburg to be the “main headquarters of the Sovereign Order of Malta until such time as circumstances permit the selection of a Grand Master in accordance with its ancient statutes and decrees” [Polnoe sobranie zakonov Rossiiskoi Imperii, hereafter PSZ, № 17794]. The notion of a hereditary Grand Master was immediately rejected by the new Emperor. The insignia of the Order of Malta were quickly removed from the State symbols of the Russian Empire [see the Imperial decree “Concerning the use of the State Coat of Arms without the Cross of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem,” in PSZ, № 19850]. In an effort to resolve the issues with the Order in Russia as quickly as possible, Emperor Alexander I insisted that, if the election of a new Grand Master could not be conducted fully in accord with the Order’s “ancient statutes and decrees,” then the Pope would decide who the next Grand Master would be. In 1803, Pope Pius VII appointed Giovanni Battista Tommasi as Grand Master. That same year, Emperor Alexander I resigned as Protector of the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\nOn February 26, 1810, Emperor Alexander I stripped the Order of Malta of its wealth and palace in Russia [see the Imperial decree to General-Field Marshall Count N. I. Saltykov “Concerning the disposition of funds of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem,” in PSZ, №24134]. In essence, it was then, in 1810, that one can consider the Russian Orthodox Priory and generally of all activity of the Sovereign Order of Malta in the Russian Empire to have ended. Later decrees concerning Emperor Paul I’s abandoned “Maltese project” merely follow up on or clarify decisions about the Order that had been made earlier.\n\nOn November 20, 1811, by a decree issued by the Senate entitled “Concerning the noble estates of family in the Commandery of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem,” the noble (hereditary) Commandery was abolished [see PSZ, № 24882]. On January 20, 1817, a Policy Statement by the Council of Ministers, which was approved by the Emperor, entitled “Concerning the disallowance of those who have received the Order of St. John of Jerusalem at the present time to wear said Order” [PSZ, № 26626] set forth the final terms under which the Sovereign Order of Malta would exist in the Russian Empire. Honorary knights and commanders of the Sovereign Order of Malta, who had received this honour previously, would not be deprived of membership of the Order, but it was also clarified that “after the death of commanders of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, their heirs will not inherit membership in the Order and will not wear its insignia, inasmuch as the Order no longer exists in the Russian Empire.” Henceforth, the Sovereign Order of Malta was viewed in Russia as an exclusively foreign Order. Eventually, subjects of the Russian Empire who were knights of the Order of Malta “at the present time” were no longer allowed even to wear its insignia.\n\nAs for the history of the Sovereign Order of Malta subsequently, events developed in the following way:\n\nAfter the death of Giovanni Battista Tommasi in 1805, the Knights of Malta attempted to elect their next Grand Master. But Giuseppe Caracciolo, who had been elected Grand Master by the knights, was not confirmed by Pope Pius VII and was therefore not recognized as Grand Master, even on a de facto level. In 1805, Pius VII appointed Innico Maria Guevara-Suardo as Lieutenant of the Order. Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, governed the Order until 1879, when Lieutenant Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce was confirmed as Grand Master by Pope Leo XIII.\n\nAttempts by the Sovereign Order of Malta to return to Malta after the collapse of Napoleonic France were unsuccessful. The island was handed over to England by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.\n\nHowever, despite all the blows of fate that struck it in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Sovereign Order of Malta preserved its sovereign rights and was recognized as an entity under international law by the Congresses of the Holy Alliance in Aachen (1818) and Verona (1822), and was also recognized as such in numerous other international treaties.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Order settled in Rome (in 1834, in the Magistral Palace on the Via Condotti) and came to include four Priories: Rome, Venice, Naples, and Prague.\n\nRelations between the Sovereign Order of Malta and the Russian Empire up until the revolution of 1917 were friendly and mutually respectful. Emperors Alexander I, Nicholas I, Alexander III, and Nicholas II were all Bailiffs Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Order of Malta. Emperor Alexander II was the only Russian monarch of the 19th century who was not a knight of the Order of Malta, but with his permission, his heir – Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich, the future Alexander III (in December 1875) – and then two of his other sons – Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich and Pavel Alexandrovich (in February 1881) – were made knights of the Order of Malta. In February 1891, with the permission of Emperor Alexander III, the Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich, the future Holy Royal Passion-Bearer Emperor Nicholas II, was made a Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion. In April 1896, the Holy Royal Passion-Bearer Empress Alexandra Feodorovna was made a Dame Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion.\n\nIn accepting the title of Bailiff of the Order of Malta, the Russian Emperors wholly recognized the legitimate continuity and all the historical rights of the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1917, relations between the exiled Russian Imperial House and the Order of Malta was for a time necessarily carried out through semi-official and personal correspondence and face-to-face contacts. Full and official relations were restored by H.I.H. Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, the Head of the Russian Imperial House, and Grand Master Angelo de Mojana di Cologna, who headed the Sovereign Order of Malta from 1962 to 1988.\n\nIn 1961, Grand Master Angelo de Mojana di Cologna revived the tradition of elevating the Heads of the Russian Imperial House to the rank of Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Order of Malta. Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich accepted the title of Bailiff, and his wife, Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna, accepted the title Dame Grand Cross of Merit. In 1963, Grand Master Angelo de Mojana di Cologna was awarded the highest Russian order of chivalry, the Imperial Order of St. Andrew the First-Called.\n\nIn 1994, there was a symbolic exchange of honours between Grand Master Andrew Bertie, who led the Sovereign Order of Malta from 1988 to 2008, and the Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, who inherited the rights and responsibilities of Head of the Russian Imperial House on the death of her father in 1992. The Grand Master became a knight of the Imperial Order of St. Andrew the First-Called, and the Grand Duchess became a Dame Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, and her son and heir, H.I.H. the Tsesarevich and Grand Duke George of Russia, met in Rome at the Magistral Palace with Grand Master Matthew Festing, who has led the Sovereign Order of Malta since the passing of Andrew Bertie in 2008. The Grand Duchess awarded him the Imperial Order of St. Andrew the First-Called, and the Grand Master made Grand Duke George of Russia a Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion.\n\nOf course, the cooperation between the Russian Imperial House and the Sovereign Order of Malta is not limited to ceremonial indications of mutual honor and recognition. As far back as the 1990s, the Grand Duchess Maria of Russia and Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna were able to offer substantial charitable aid to medical institutions in Russia thanks to the assistance of the Sovereign Order of Malta. Collaboration between the House of Romanoff and the Sovereign Order of Malta on a range of charitable endeavours continues to grow and evolve today.\n\nAs for the Russian Orthodox Grand Priory, it existed only for a few years and ceased entirely to exist during the reign of Emperor Alexander I. There were some residual hints in court ceremonies of a “Maltese” presence in Russia, including the red liveries at the Imperial Court and the miniature Maltese Cross worn by the graduates of the Corps des Pages academy, which was located in the Vorontsov Palace, which had been confiscated from the Order of Malta in 1810 – none of which constitutes “proof” of an on-going “hidden” or “secret” continuation of the former Orthodox Priory of the Order of Malta. Some writers who attempt to make a case for the continuation of the Order of Malta in Russia fail to distinguish between the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Malta and the Prussian Order “Pour le Mérite.” They present photographs of Emperor Alexander II wearing the “Pour le Mérite” as proof of their fantastical theories of the “continuation of the Russian Orthodox Grand Priory”—Alexander II, who was the only emperor after Paul I who was not a member of the Order of Malta!\n\nA Public Policy Statement from the Council of Ministers, affirmed by the Emperor and dated January 20, 1817, clearly states that the Order of Malta “does not exist in Russia” [PSZ, № 26626]. However, after the revolution of 1917, there was an attempt by Russian emigrants to revive the Orthodox Chapter of the Order of Malta that had been abolished over a century earlier. Several descendants of the (formerly) hereditary noble Commanders – all members of Russian aristocratic families – sought to restore the Orthodox Russian Grand Priory, citing their desire to take “actions founded on self-denial and sacrifice.” They sought approval not from the Head of the Russian Imperial House, the Emperor-in-Exile Kirill I, and not even from the Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, who was recognized as a political “leader” by a certain part of the Russian emigration, but from a member of the most junior branch of the House of Romanoff, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, who was asked to take the life-long title of “Grand Prior of Russia”, and to take steps to resurrect the “Russian Grand Priory.”\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich was favourably disposed to this undertaking, but refrained from taking the title “Grand Prior” and limited himself only to offering his patronage to the newly-formed organization. The Orthodox Priory of the Order of Malta displayed discretion, naming their association not the “Russian Grand Priory” (as they had originally proposed to do), but the “Russian Philanthropic Association of the Descendants of the Hereditary Commanders of the Sovereign Order of Malta.” As this name implies, the members of this organization were not claiming to be “hereditary Commanders” themselves, and understood that, without the approval of the Sovereign Order of Malta, they could only become a purely memorial association of descendants of Commanders, and not themselves be Commanders of a “Orthodox Russian Grand Priory.” They did not claim to be Knights of Malta.\n\nIn 1929, the members of the “Russian Philanthropic Association of the Descendants of the Hereditary Commanders of the Sovereign Order of Malta” worked through Baron M. Taube to attempt to “obtain the permission of the Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of Malta in Rome to recreate the Russian branch of the said Order” [Letter of September 29, 1929, from Baron M. Taube].\n\nIn response to this request, the Secretary of the Sovereign Order of Malta, Baron Bistrem, on instructions from Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere, in a letter dated February 13, 1932, unequivocally rejected the idea, emphasizing that members of the Sovereign Order of Malta must belong to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAs a historical memorial association of descendants, the “Russian Philanthropic Association of the Descendants of the Hereditary Commanders of the Sovereign Order of Malta” had every right to exist, and it enjoyed the support of Grand Duke Andrei Wladimirovich, who became the organization’s patron after the death of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich in 1933, and later, the support of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. The Sovereign Order of Malta itself also had a positive relationship with the descendants of Russian Orthodox Commanders of the Order, as organized as “Russian Philanthropic Association of the Descendants of the Hereditary Commanders of the Sovereign Order of Malta.” The Secretary of the Union of Noble Descendants of Commanders, Iu. S. Rtishev, even was made a Knight of Honour and Devotion, and so became a member of the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\nUnfortunately, in 1973 the formerly measured and entirely reasonable position of the “Union of Descendants of the Hereditary Commanders and Knights of the Grand Priory of the Russian Order of Malta” were abandoned. Count N. A. Bobrinskii, who was living in the USA in the 1970s, formed an association called the “Sovereign Order of the Orthodox Knights-Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem,” and began calling himself “Grand Prior.” The Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, did not approve this action. The Grand Duke’s position did not disturb the members of this new organization, who had embarked on a completely new and arbitrary course of fiction that led them away from the historical Order of Malta. A “Protector” for this new organization was found in the person of Prince-of-the-Imperial-Blood Andrei Alexandrovich, a member of the most junior branch of the House of Romanoff who then was not on good terms with the lawful Head of the Dynasty. After his death, Prince Andrei Alexandrovich’s younger brother, Prince-of-the-Imperial-Blood Vasilii Alexandrovich, became the new “Protector.” And when Prince Vasilii died, Andrei Alexandrovich’s son, Mikhail Andreevich Romanoff (who was born of Prince Andrei’s morganatic marriage with Elisabetta von Frederici, born Princess Ruffo), became the organization’s “Protector.”\n\nThe so-called “Sovereign Order of the Orthodox Knights-Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem” has never had any continuity with the Orthodox Russian Grand Priory, which was abolished more than 150 years earlier by Emperor Alexander I. This alleged “revival” received no sanction from either the Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of Malta, or from the Head of the Russian Imperial House. The so-called “Protectors” of this organization after its re-founding in the 1970s were not inpiduals who by right could have held the position of Protectors of the Order of Malta; instead, they were simply the first people who, out of a careless disregard for the historical facts, agreed to participate in this illegitimate enterprise out of ambition and the need for money.\n\nSoon a whole gallery of exotic organizations appeared all calling themselves the “Russian Order of Malta.” At best, these were fanciful mock associations, and at worst, fraudulent societies trading in false “passports of the Sovereign Order of Malta,” false “knighthoods,” and other fraudulent “activities.” Particularly harmful have been those cases when the names and emblems of the Sovereign Order of Malta have been exploited for financial gain and political purposes, especially when dishonourable and irresponsible persons, claiming themselves to be representatives of the Order, have interfered in internal political conflicts in various countries. Unfortunately, the activities of these fraudulent “Orders of Malta” have sometimes led to ill feelings toward the genuine Sovereign Order of Malta, which has complicated its important and vast charitable activities around the globe. The Sovereign Order of Malta avoids assiduously any politicization of its activities and enjoys and deserves the respect it has earned from governments, traditional religious groups, royal dynasties, and other reputable historical institutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the following points should be emphasized:\n\n1. The founding of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta occurred before the formal schism of the Church into the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church in 1054, but all of its history and activities are connected with the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Paschal II formally recognized the Order and placed it under his protection in 1113. In this way, the Sovereign Order of Malta has always been and remains a Catholic Order. All assertions that the Order of Malta is “non-denominational” and “inter-confessional,” or that it is “Masonic” and so on, are absurd and do not stand up to scrutiny.\n\n2. Emperor Paul I of Russia was elected to the position of Grand Master at the most critical moment in the history of the Order of Malta. He saved it from destruction and sought to make it not only an Order of Chivalry of the Russian Empire, but also an influential global force in the struggle for the values of Christian civilization that are common to Orthodox and Catholics. That election, however, never received the necessary legal confirmation on an international level. Some violations of procedures in his election (for example, the inability of a large number of electors to participate in the election, as required by the Statute of the Order) could be considered insignificant and not affecting the legitimacy of the outcome of the election, especially in view of the extreme situation in a Europe that was then being torn apart by revolution and war. Even so, the lack of any formal recognition of the legality of the election of Paul I by Pope Pius VI and Pius VII makes it impossible to consider him Grand Master de jure. He is properly honoured as the Protector of the Order and as de facto Grand Master only.\n\n3. The Orthodox Grand Priory of Russia, and the activities of the Order of Malta inside the Russian Empire, were entirely abolished in 1817 by Emperor Alexander I, and there has not been any legitimate restoration.\n\n4. Attempts by descendants of the Russian Orthodox Noble (hereditary) Commanders of the Order of Malta to revive the “Orthodox Grand Priory of Russia” after 1917 have not been successful. The historical memorial association that was established after the Russian Revolution was formed legitimately and for a time even enjoyed the support of the Russian Imperial House and the Sovereign Order of Malta. However, unauthorized actions by this organization in the 1970s deprived it of recognition from the House of Romanoff and the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\n5. All so-called “Orthodox” and other false “Orders of Malta” are, at best, a kind of childish game and, at worst, a source of fraud and political provocation. The philanthropic slogans of such organizations serve only as a cover for harmful activities. Belonging to a false order conveys no rights or duties of any sort, and certainly none of the rights or duties belonging to genuine knights of the Sovereign Order of Malta.\n\n6. Protestant Orders of St. John (in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Great Britain) share the same historic tradition and the same mission of the Sovereign Order of Malta: giving assistance to the sick and the poor. These four orders have gained recognition by virtue of their having been instituted by the legitimate hereditary sovereigns of these nations, and by the subsequent recognition of them by the Sovereign Order of Malta. There is no possible comparison between these Protestant Orders of St. John and the clearly false “Orthodox Orders of Malta.”\n\n7. Any person who elects to enter one of the false “Orders of Malta” or who supports any contact with them, risks becoming a victim of deception and of suffering reputation or financial loss.\n\nAll questions relating to the legitimate Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, which maintains formal and friendly relations with the Russian Imperial House, should be directed to the following address:\n\nSovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta\n\nMagistral Palace\n\nVia Condotti, 68 – 00187 Rome – Italy\n\nTel. +39.06.67581.251\n\nFax +39.06.6797.202\n\ne-mail: info@orderofmalta.int\n\nOfficial Webpage: http://www.orderofmalta.int\n\nIn Russia:\n\nEmbassy of the Sovereign Order of Malta in the Russian Federation\n\nul.

Inasmuch, as of your affection thou hast requested, with regard to the Hospital which thou hast founded in the city of Jerusalem, in proximity to the Church of the Blessed John the Baptist, that it should be supported by the authority of the Apostolic See, and fostered by the patronage of the blessed Apostle Peter: We, therefore, much pleased with the pious earnestness of your hospitality, do receive the petition with our paternal favour, and do ordain and establish, by the authority of this our present decree, that that house of God, your Hospital, shall now be placed, and shall for ever remain, under the protection of the Apostolic See, and under that of the Blessed Peter. All things whatsoever, therefore, which by your preserving care and solicitude have been collected for the benefit of the said Hospital, for the support and maintenance of pilgrims, or for relieving the necessities of the poor, whether in the churches of Jerusalem, or in those of parishes within the limits of other cities; and whatsoever goods may have been offered already by the faithful, or for the future may through God’s grace be so offered, or collected by other lawful means; and whatsoever goods have been, or shall be granted to thee, or to thy successors, or to the brethren who are occupied in the care and support of pilgrims, by the venerable brethren the bishops of the diocese of Jerusalem; we hereby decree shall be retained by you and undiminished.\n\nMoreover, as to the tithes of your revenues, which you collect everywhere at your own charge, and by your own toil, we do hereby fix and decree, that they shall be retained by your own Hospital, all opposition on the part of the bishops and their clergy notwithstanding. We also decree as valid all donations which have been made to your Hospital by pious princes, either of their tribute moneys or other donations. We ordain furthermore, that at your death no man shall be appointed in your place, as chief and master, by any underhand subtlety, or by violence; but him only who shall, by the inspiration of God, have been duly elected by the professed brethren of the Institution.\n\nFurthermore, all dignities or possessions which your Hospital at present holds either on this side of the water, in Asia, or in Europe, as also those which hereafter by God’s bounty it may obtain; we confirm them to you and to your successors, who shall devote themselves with pious zeal to the cares of hospitality, and through you to the said Hospital in perpetuity. We further decree that it shall be unlawful for any man whatsoever rashly to disturb your Hospital, or to carry off any of its property, or if carried off to retain possession of it, or to diminish anything from its revenues, or to harass it with audacious annoyances. But let all its property remain intact, for the sole use and enjoyment of those for whose maintenance and support it has been granted. As to the Hospitals or Poor Houses in the Western provinces, in the Borgo of St.Egidio, Asti, Pisa, Bari, Otranto, Taranto and Messina, which are distinguished by the title of Hospitals of Jerusalem, we decree that they shall for ever remain, as they are this day, under the subjection and disposal of yourself and your successors. If, therefore, at a future time, any person, whether ecclesiastical or secular, knowing this paragraph of our constitution, shall attempt to oppose its provisions, and if, after having received a second or third warning, he shall not make a suitable satisfaction and restitution, let him be deprived of all his dignities and honours, and let him know that he stands exposed to the judgment of God, for the iniquity he has perpetrated; and let him be deprived of the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ, and of the benefits of the redemption of our Lord, and at the last judgment let him meet with the severest vengeance. But to all who deal justly and rightly with the same, on them be the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that not only here below they may receive the rewards of good actions, but also before the Judge of all mankind, they may enjoy the blessing of peace eternal.\n\nI Paschal, bishop of the Catholic Church, have signed\n\nI Richard Bishop of Albano, have signed\n\nI Landulphus Archbishop of Benevento, have read and signed\n\nI Canon Bishop of the Church of Preneste, have read and signed\n\nI Anastasio Cardinal priest with the title of Blessed Clement, have signed\n\nI Gregory Bishop of Terracina, have read and signed\n\nI John Bishop of Mellito, have read and signed\n\nI Romuald Cardinal Deacon of the Roman Church, have signed\n\nI Gregorio Cardinal priest of San Crisogono, have read and signed\n\nGiven at Benevento, by the hand of John, Cardinal and librarian of the Roman Church, on the 15th day of February, in the 6th cycle of indiction of the incarnation of our Lord, in the year 1113, and in the 14th year of the Pontificate of Pope Paschal II.\n\nSource: SMOM\n\nAppendix 6\n\nHistorical Notice on the Russian Grand Priory of the Order of Malta.\n\nSource: Public Record Office Copenhagen, Denmark.
