        "text": "\"Ars longa, vita brevis\" – art is long, life is short. And indeed, one trip is not enough to explore all the fascinating art treasures Saxony has to offer, including the unique Old Masters Picture Gallery and the Green Vault in Dresden, Leipzig’s fine art museum, or the Gunzenhauser Museum in Chemnitz, to name but a few. Read on and be inspired!\n\nFor more than 450 years, the museums of the Dresden State Art Collections have displayed a unique wealth of world-class works of art.\n\nThe international fame of the Old Masters Picture Gallery is based on masterpieces such as Raphael's \"Sistine Madonna\", Giorgione's \"Slumbering Venus\", Correggio's \"Holy Night\", Cranach's \"The St Catherine Altarpiece\", Vermeer's \"Lady of Letters\" and Bellotto's Dresden city views. The numerous widely known paintings by van Eyck, Dürer, Holbein, Rubens, Rembrandt, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Murillo, Canaletto, Tiepolo, Raeburn and Graff add to the enticing collection, creating a rare art treasure, all in one place!"
