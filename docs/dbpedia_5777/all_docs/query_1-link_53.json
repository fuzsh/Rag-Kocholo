        "text": "5 Just how the Army played this game is illustrated by the incident concerning the Independents. The Army wanted the latter eliminated from the Provisional Government, but Ebert refused. However, less than two weeks later, on December 23, Ebert and his Cabinet were besieged in the Chancellery by troops of the “Peoples' Marine Division,” and it was necessary that the Army come to the rescue. It is significant that Ebert reformed the Provisional Government without the Independents. The Nemesis of Power, pp. 31–36.Google Scholar\n\n14 Grzesinski, Albert C., Inside Germany (New York, 1939), p. 84Google Scholar. In early March of 1920, the Reichswehrministerium ordered General Walter von Luettwitz, Commander of Gruppenkommando I near Berlin, to disband a marine brigade led by a Freikorps captain named Ehrhardt (sometimes called the Ehrhardt Brigade). In short, Luettwitz was already involved with a Dr. Wolfgang Kapp in a plan to overthrow the Republic, and therefore Ehrhardt's Brigade was allowed to enter Berlin on March 13. Ebert and the government fled to Stuttgart and proclaimed a general strike which was so successful that it left Kapp and Luettwitz isolated and without an ounce of power. On March 17, Kapp fled Berlin and the Kapp Putsch ended in failure.\n\n20 It is true that when Ebert called a general strike he was given a wholehearted response. However, after the defeat of Kapp the strike continued in the Ruhr, and the government utilized the services of some Freikorps groups to aid in disarming the workers. Along with the Reichswehr these groups helped in restoring order, but not until bitter fighting had ensued. “Order was completely restored by the end of April … the alliance of the Socialists and the generals had triumphed over the workers.” Knight-Patterson, , Germany from Defeat to Conquest, p. 282.Google Scholar\n\n26 One case in point occurred shortly before the Hitler Putsch. At the same period that trouble was brewing in Bavaria a major by the name of Buchrucker attempted a rebellion. Buchrucker had issued orders to the units of the “Black Reichswehr” to mobilize at the fortress of Kustrine outside Berlin. The Reich government declared a state of emergency, and Buchrucker approached the Reichswehr headquarters for support for his plan, but instead the Reichswehr ordered his arrest and the putsch ended in failure. “In the future the Army would allow the Black Army to exist … but after Kustrine, Seeckt was more than ever convinced that only the legal way could lead to the reconstruction of Germany's military power.” Waite, Robert G. L., Vanguard of Nazism (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1952), p. 253Google Scholar. See also Buchrucker, Major, Im Schatten Seeckt's (Berlin, 1928.)Google Scholar\n\n28 Seeckt's Papers contain an interesting letter dated October 30, 1923, from the Mecklenburg-Strelitzer Landbund. The letter is signed by some halfdozen persons and begins by lauding Seeckt for his work in re-building the Reichswehr to a respectable strength. However, “… only one trouble darkens the horizon: the conflict with Bavaria. We implore you to use all strength necessary that this struggle be brought to a suitable end for the sake of a united Reich. A union of Seeckt and Kahr is the greatest wish of all German patriots.” Roll 15.\n\n37 “General Hans von Seeckt and Russia, 1920–1922,” The Journal of Modern History, XXI (03, 1949), 33–34Google Scholar, f.n. Curiously enough Stresemann recorded in a note of November 9, 1923, that he had received a complaint from the Allies to the effect that the Hitler Putsch illustrated that the Bavarian citizens were by no means disarmed. Stresemann scoffed at the idea, and wrote: “It was more probable that many men in Germany had kept their rifles, and still had them; the Government was not in a position to search every house.” Stresemann Papers, Vol. I, 202–203Google Scholar. The relationship that existed between Seeckt and Stresemann was a curious one. Hans Gatzke, in a recent work based upon some unpublished Stresemann documents, has written that just how far Stresemann was opposed to Seeckt is not clear. It is clear, however, that Seeckt's opposition to the policies of Stresemann was a constant source of irritation. Stresemann and the Rearmament of Germany (Baltimore, 1954), p. 13Google Scholar. Gatzke wrote that when the Reichswehr was attacked as the stronghold of monarchism and reaction, and some of the Reichswehr violations of the Versailles Treaty were revealed to the public, Stresemann became very angry: “He was well aware both of the Reichswehr's secret arrangements with Russia and its rearmament efforts at home. And it was largely due to his patient labors that the military fetters of Versailles … were gradually loosened. … Stresemann conveniently supplied the diplomatic front, behind which ‘Seeckt perfected his military foundation’.” Ibid., p. 15. Gatzke wrote that Seeckt never felt friendly toward Stresemann regardless of how much he acted the champion of the Reichswehr cause. Seeckt not only disliked Stresemann personally, Gatzke continued, but objected violently to Stresemann's Western orientation. Ibid., p. 38.\n\n39 It is obvious from von Seeckt's writings that he expected trouble from the politicians in carrying out his plans for secret rearmament. In a letter to his wife in February, 1919, Seeckt wrote: “I can see that my battle to renew German military strength is not going to be against the enemy (Allies). It is going to be against those representatives in Germany who are afraid to take steps in the direction of re-building. … Politics is the art of the possible—not the impossible.” Seeckt Papers, Roll 28."
