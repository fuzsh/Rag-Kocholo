INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\n\"U 528,\" a 740-ton U-Boat, commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Georg von Rabenau, was sunk by H.M.S. \"Fleetwood,\" escorting Convoy O.S. 47, at 1530 (Zone time) on 11th May, 1943, in position 46° 53' N., 14° 22' W. Previously she had suffered considerable damage from aircraft attacks, which had partially incapacitated her for diving. Four officers, including the Captain, three midshipmen and 38 ratings survived out of a total complement of 56 men. She was on her first patrol and had sunk nothing. During her sole patrol (Section III), \"U 528\" was constantly being surprised and bombed or depth-charges by aircraft. These attacks coincided with the breakdown of her G.S.R. which seldom, if ever, worked properly. The stiffened morale of prisoners and their adamant refusal to discuss service matters, presented Interrogators with a problem reminiscent of the earliest days of the war. There is little doubt that this was due to the fact, admitted by survivors, that, at some time after capture, officers had been allowed to mix with men and had cautioned or threatened them into silence. It is vital, if interrogation is to be successful, for officers to be segregated from men immediately after capture and not to be allowed to communicate with them. Equivalent German and Royal Naval Ranks used in this report are: The suffix \"(Ing.)\" after an officer's rank signifies (E), Engineer , e.g., Fähnrich (Ing.) is translated a Midshipman (Junior Grade) (E). The suffix \"d.R.\" signifies \"der Reserve\" and is translated as Reserve Officer.\n\nII. DETAILS OF \"U 528\"\n\n(C49418) B*2\n\n2\n\nIII. FIRST AND LAST PATROL OF \"U 528\"\n\n(i) \"U 528\" Leaves Kiel with five other U-Boats \"U 528\" left Kiel in the forenoon of 15th April, 1943, in company with five other U-Boats and two Sperrbrecher. The following line ahead formation was taken up: One 8,000-9,000-ton Sperrbrecher, \"U 528,\" a second 740-ton U-Boat, three 500-ton U-Boats, and a second Sperrbrecher bringing up the rear. The vessels passed through the Skagerrak on 16th April, and arrived the same night in Kristiansand S. \"U 528\" embarked an additional quantity of fuel. All the U-Boats again put to sea on 17th April, but \"U 528\" soon parted company and proceeded up the Norwegian coast escorted by one patrol vessel and by seaplanes. Visibility was bad and the coast could only be seen intermittently. On 19th April, the escort parted company and \"U 528\" set course for the Rosengarten. She was proceeding on the surface alternating between slow and half speed, diving only periodically for a maximum of two hours for practice. (ii) Approach to and Passage of Rosengarten On 18th April an entry in a captured diary states that \"U 528\" was sighted by an aircraft, dived and was depth-charged without sustaining damage. The diary adds that on 19th April, she was submerged in the North Sea east of the Shetlands. Seas were reported as heavy. Entries for the next five days run: (iii) \"U 528\" Damage while attacking a small Convoy. Prisoners said that on or about 24th April they sighted a small convoy consisting of four 2,000-3,000-ton ships and two escort vessels with two aircraft circling overhead. An attempt was made to approach the convoy and torpedo an escort vessel, but before this plan could be put into operation a counter-attack was made in which depth-charges fractured a fuel tank. causing the U-Boat to leave an oil trace. In addition one of the Q tanks burst. In spite of this damage, \"U 528\" attempted to shadow the convoy, experiencing the utmost difficulty owing to the heavy seas. On the following day \"U 528\" was again attacked, this time by an aircraft, but little or no damage was sustained. (N.I.D. Note. This was probably convoy R.U.71. A U-Boat was attacked by aircraft 2/269 in 61° 08' N., 17° 10' W., on course 230° at 1705z on 24th April, 1943.)\n\n3\n\n(iv) \"U 528\" again Damaged On 28th April, \"U 528\" was once more surprised, this time by an aircraft which dropped four bombs or depth-charges near her. These damages No. 1 torpedo tube, forward, so that it was impossible to withdraw the torpedo. In addition, No. 8 series of air-bottles was put out of action. The Engineer Officer, after inspecting the damage, said that he could no longer accept responsibility if the patrol continued. \"U 528\" remained submerged overnight and surfaced on the following day, in mountainous seas. Von Rabenau signaled C.-in-C. U-Boat that \"U 528\" could only dive \"within restricted limits.\" He also requested a new cable for his G.S.R., which was not functioning well. (N.I.D. Note. There were several attacks south of Iceland on 28th April, 1943.) (v) \"U 528\" ordered Home On 1st May, von Rabenau received orders to make a rendezvous with a supply U-Boat, transfer his surplus oil and provisions and then return to Lorient. (vi) \"U 528\" meets a Supply U-Boat \"U 528\" turned for home on an original course of 180° and later met the supply U-Boat after searching for her for some days. A considerable amount of fuel was transhipped to the supply U-Boat, but no provisions. (vii) Events leading up to Sinking When approaching the Bay of Biscay, on about 10th May, \"U 528\" sighted another aircraft and submerged. She later surfaced, but again submerged at 2300 on this day. Up to this time, prisoners said, they had sighted about 12 aircraft in all. They believed that one 500-ton U-Boat, which had left Kiel with them, was sunk before she got through the Rosengarten, as a signal was intercepted, showing this U-Boat to be three to four days overdue in reporting to base.\n\nIV. SINKING OF \"U 528\"\n\n(N.I.D. Note. In the absence of a report from H.M.S. \"Fleetwood\" at the time of interrogation, it was impossible to check prisoners' statements or to correlate them fully with the details of \"Fleetwood's\" report as finally received.) \"U 528\" remained submerged the remainder of the night of 10th/11th May. Because of previous damage, her motors were running at an uneconomical speed in order to maintain trim and by morning her batteries were low. (N.I.D. Note. Two U-Boats were heard transmitting at 2127z and 2315z on 10th May on the convoy's starboard bow. The visibility was bad and it is considered improbable that either had sighted the convoy.) At dawn she surfaced, but was again surprised by aircraft and bombed. (N.I.D. Note. Halifax aircraft \"D\" of 58 Squadron sighted and attacked a U-Boat in 46° 55' N., 14° 44' W., at 0701z on 11th May, 1943. At 0722z, with the convoy in position 47° 07' N., 14° 19' W., course 186°, speed 6 knots, a Halifax aircraft reported by R/T having sighted a U-Boat which had dived in position 217° ZZ 10 miles. H.M.S. \"Mignonette\" was ordered to this position and to rejoin by 1000 if not in contact. At 0749z, an aircraft reported by R/T sighting and attacking another U-Boat (very probably \"U 528\") in position 280° ZZ eight miles. H.M.S. \"Fleetwood\" was ordered to this position with orders to rejoin by 1030 if not in contact.) \"U 528\" dived to make good her escape, but soon afterwards the propeller noises of a surface vessel were heard on the hydrophones and she then sustained a prolonged depth-charge attack. (N.I.D. Note. At 0820z \"Fleetwood\" reported she was in position marked by the aircraft's smoke float. At 0850 she obtained an asdic contact, range 500 yards, and H.M. Ships \"Mignonette\" and \"Wedgeport\" were ordered to join her. The following depth-charge attacks then took place: Survivors said that one of the depth-charges from the earlier attacks exploded against their bow compartment, causing a water entry which badly upset trim. (N.I.D. Note. At 0941z \"Fleetwood\" sighted spray from the U-Boat's conning-tower. The boat was then estimated as on a southerly course at an estimated speed of 6-8 knots. At 0941-1/2 \"Fleetwood\" altered course towards and the U-Boat dived.) Survivors said that they then went to a depth of some 700 ft. Electric motors had to be run at full speed to prevent her from sinking still deeper. (C49418) B**\n\n4\n\n(N.I.D. Note. At 0944 \"Fleetwood\" re-established asdic contact at a range of 1,500 yards. She then made the following depth-charge attacks: During the second series of depth-charge attacks, \"U 528\" used her S.B.T. gear, but the effect of this was negatived by the fact that each time tanks were blown in order to keep her from sinking too deep, the noise made by the damaged blowing gear was far louder than the S.B.T. charges. The starboard hydrophones were no longer functioning. Finally, the torpedo in the damaged forward tube began to run. This scared Rabenau who, after surveying other damage, which included one water-logged Diesel, many smashed gages and controls and a further series of air-bottles out of commission, decided to surface and abandon ship. To do this, he was compelled to use his remaining H/P air and all his oxygen. Prisoners said that their boat surfaced at so steep an angle that it was impossible to stand. (N.I.D. Note. At 1319z \"Fleetwood\" sighted the U-Boat bearing 180°, stopped and low in the water at a range of 4,600 yards.) Prisoners continued that their boat made a short attempt to escape on the surface, during which period they believed that she managed to make a short signal to C.-in-C. U-Boats reporting her sinking. The escape attempt was, however, soon terminated by gunfire from a neighboring surface vessel. \"U 528's\" ship's company then jumped into the water, the Engineer Officer having first opened the vents. (N.I.D. Note. At 1321z \"Fleetwood\" fired 23 rounds at the U-Boat. At 1324 she ceased fire and the U-Boat sank stern first. \"Fleetwood\" rescued 39 survivors and \"Mignonette\" six. \"Fleetwood\" set course to rejoin convoy at 1445 and at 2230 was in station.)\n\nV. GENERAL REMARKS ON U-BOATS\n\n(i) Hydrophones A prisoner from \"U 444\" still under interrogation believed K.D.B. hydrophones to be useless. Although originally constructed as an emergency alternative to G.H.G., the gear was far more delicate and would break down before G.H.G. under the same conditions. (ii) Aerials (a) W/T. The same prisoner from \"U 444\" stated that the extensible rod aerial for W/T transmission and reception by submerged U-Boats has been found unsatisfactory and is no longer being fitted. (b) G.S.R. He said that one type of G.S.R. aerial is mounted on the bridge and is extensible through approximately 10 ft. (iii) G.S.R. \"U 528\" was fitted with a \"Grandin\" receiver. This was an oblong-shaped box with various knobs and switches as follows: \"U 528\" was given 135 cm. as the wavelength of destroyers acting as convoy escorts. A prisoner stated that the second oscillator is being withdrawn from all G.S.R. sets.\n\n5\n\n(iv) Evasion of British A/S.V. The Second Lieutenant of \"U 528\" stated that, owing to the new British \"soundless\" S.E., U-Boats have now been ordered to proceed submerged at night and to surface to charge batteries during the day through the Bay of Biscay. (v) A/A Training at Misdroy There is a four-day course for all deck personnel now being held at Misdroy. The first three days are devoted to theoretical and practical training in the 20 mm. gun; the last day to the 37 mm. gun. Each man fires 100 rounds with a 20 mm., and 20/30 rounds with a 37 mm. gun. A prisoner claimed that, after the order had been given by the officer of the watch, fire was unrestricted. Each individual gun was not given a definite area. The opening range for both 20 mm. and 37 mm. during training was estimated at 1,500 metres. (N.I.D. Note. One prisoner gave 600 metres for the 20 mm., but from operational reports and previous prisoners statements this is considered unlikely.) (vi) Guns Some details of various guns were given as follows: (a) 20 mm. Ammunition in 20-round clips. Two-ring sight, speed allowances; smaller ring 50-60 metres per second, larger ring 120 m. per second. Second 20 mm. gun on additional platform manned by members of the watch below. Approached through conning-tower hatch. (b) 37 mm. Elevation estimated at 170°, depression unknown. Training through 360°. Triple ringsight with speed allowances very approximately varying from 50-80 meters per second for smallest to 150 metres per second for largest ringsight. Had knob on right side enabling gunner to see only one ringsight at a time. Survivors said that a 740-tonner which sailed from Kiel with \"U 528\" had her 37 mm. gun removed in preparation for mounting quadruple 20 mm. guns later. (c) 105 mm. Elevation estimated at 50°, depression horizontal. Training 90° to either side. (vii) Anti-Aircraft U-Boats Officers spoke of anti-aircraft U-Boats at present under construction. They were described as \"sea boats\" of some 1,200 tons. The bridge was said to extend from the torpedo loading gear forward to the galley hatch aft; the deck was on the same level throughout and the after part of the bridge resembled the forward part. Armament was given as follows: Two quadruple mountings forward, said to 40 mm. power-controlled turrets 27 mm. on the bridge forward. 20 mm. amidships. 15 mm. machine gun on the bridge aft. M.G. 81 with rate of fire 3,000 rounds a minute was also carried. This was described as a \"mowing machine\" in that individual shots could not be heard and only a singing noise. Each clip was said to hold 500 rounds. These U-Boats have orders to remain surfaced on the approach of aircraft. An officer remarked that it was a suicide job, although possibly a quick way of earning the Knight Insignia of the Iron Cross. (viii) Look-Outs Look-out watches in \"U 528\" were as follows:\n\n1st Watch.\n\n2nd Watch.\n\n3rd Watch.\n\n1200-1600\n\n1600-1800\n\n1800-2000\n\n2000-2400\n\n2400-0400\n\n0400-0800\n\n0800-1200\n\n1200-1600\n\n1600-1800\n\n1800-2000\n\n2000-2400\n\n2400-0400\n\netc.\n\nLook-outs had ordinary anti-glare brown glasses for daytime. At night no glasses were worn below decks by personnel about to proceed on watch, but they went on deck some ten minutes before taking over. No special glasses for use against searchlights were known to prisoners. (ix) Pressure Dock Tests \"U 659's\" Engineer Officer said that all U-Boats are built to withstand a pressure of 105 metres' depth. In the pressure dock at Kiel they are tested to 90 kg. (approximately 200 lbs.). He mentioned that the pressure dock burst when one U-Boat was tested to 110 m. It is not the pressure hull or valves which give way but the periscope glands. He claimed that a new U-Boat, with periscope shaft some 18 in. longer, prevented this and described these craft as being pressure tight. He said that this type would withstand any amount of damage to outboard installations, such as screws, without water entering. (x) U-Boat Losses Three U-Boats have run on mines laid by aircraft in the estuary at Lorient. On one occasion six U-Boats were sunk by aircraft at about the same time, three in the Bay of Biscay and three in the Mediterranean. (xi) Look-Out Balloons One prisoner alleged that U-Boats will soon no longer be fitted with extensible look-out masts, but will have a balloon instead. A look-out will be flown in the balloon in order to have a wider horizon. The prisoner admitted that he had not seen this but had only heard a rumour about it.\n\n6\n\nAPPENDIX \"A.\"\n\n_______\n\nEARLY HISTORY AND TRIALS OF \"U 528\"\n\n(i) Building \"U 528 was built by the Deutsch Werft, Hamburg. She was nearing completion in July, 1942, when members of the complement were drafted to the dockyard to stand by her. (ii) Commissioning \"U 528\" was commissioned about 20th September, 1942, with Kapitänleutnant Karl Heinz Fuchs in command. (iii) U.A.K. Trials \"U 528\" left Hamburg immediately after commissioning and proceeded to Kiel for acceptance trials with the U.A.K. These were completed by 26th September. (iv) First torpedo-Firing Exercises at Gdynia \"U 528\" then proceeded from Kiel to Gdynia for torpedo-firing exercises. These took place between 28th September and 5th October. (v) Agru-Front at Hel \"U 528\" completed her Agru-Front tests at Hel between 5th and 25th October. (vi) At Danzig (vii) Tactical Exercises off Pillau \"U 528\" began her tactical exercises off Pillau at the end of October. Among others, she was in company with a U-Boat commanded by Korvettenkapitän Bleichrodt and a 1,200 tonner. Fuchs, who was alleged to have been politically \"insecure,\" immediately fell foul of Korvettenkapitän von Stockhausen, the S.O. conducting the exercises. After a number of quarrels, von Stockhausen finally achieved Fuchs' removal from his command on the grounds of deficient eyesight. Fuchs was relieved by Oberleutnant zur See Georg von Rabenau. (viii) Return to Danzig (ix) Second Tactical Exercises A second series of tactical exercises, with von Rabenau as Captain, began at Pillau, on 29th or 30th December. Von Rabenau was allegedly a drunkard, and on two occasions put to sea when drunk. As he was regarded as \"politically sound\" nothing came of either incident. On the first occasion he rammed a torpedo recovery vessel and \"U 528\" had to put into Königsberg for repairs to superstructure. This ramming occurred on 8th or 9th January, 1942. (x) Final Overhaul at Hamburg Exercises completed, \"U 528\" returned to Hamburg, where she went into dock for final overhaul. She remained at Hamburg from mid-January to 20th February. (xi) Completion of Torpedo-Firing Exercises \"U 528\" left Hamburg to complete her working-up trials in the Baltic on 20th February. Calling in at Kiel for a few hours, she reached Danzig on about 23rd February. She immediately began further torpedo-firing exercises, which were completed by 8th March. (xii) Further Tactical Exercises Further tactical exercises took place between the 10th and 15th March from Gdynia. (xiii) Silent Running Trials at Rönne \"U 528\" underwent silent running trials off Rönne, on Bornholm Island, while working up, but the exact date is unknown. (xiv) Final Adjustments at Stettin \"U 528\" put into the Oderwerke, Stettin, on 18th March. Adjustments were completed about 6th April, and she had only a trimming test to undergo when von Rabenau, again drunk, rammed a pier and damaged her bows. Provisional repairs were made with which \"U 528\" set out on her first patrol. Torpedoes and fuel were embarked at Stettin about 10th April. (xv) At Kiel prior to First Patrol Leaving Stettin on 11th April, \"U 528\" arrived at Kiel for the start of her first operational patrol on 14th April. She here embarked fresh food only."
