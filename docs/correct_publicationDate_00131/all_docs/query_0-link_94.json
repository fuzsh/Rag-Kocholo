        "text": "Our book group is open to all. Attend every meeting, occasionally or just once a lifetime. All we ask is that you read the book in advance and take part in the discussion. There’s a short introduction by a member of staff or a group regular or someone we know with a special interest in the book in question.\n\nThe Absolute at Large, is a science fiction novel written by Czech author Karel Čapek in 1922. The first sentence opens the story on New Year’s Day 1943 – a future date at the time of writing. Introduced tonight by a Czech member of the group.\n\nIn this satirical classic, a brilliant scientist invents the Karburator, a reactor that can create abundant and practically free energy. However, the Karburator’s superefficient energy production also yields a powerful by-product. The machine works by completely annihilating matter and in so doing releases the Absolute, the spiritual essence held within all matter, into the world. Infected by the heady, pure Absolute, the world’s population becomes consumed with religious and national fervor, the effects of which ultimately cause a devastating global war. The Absolute at Large questions the ethics and rampant spread of power, mass production, and atomic weapons that Karel Čapek saw in the technological and political revolutions occurring around him.\n\nFree, refreshments provided."
