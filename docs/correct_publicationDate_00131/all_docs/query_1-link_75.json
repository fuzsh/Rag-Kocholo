        "text": "Language arts teachers read and analyze literature with their students all day for hours at a time, guiding lessons on the nuances of the written word. It should come as no surprise, then, that many teachers have become successful authors in their own right. After days spent immersed in children’s literature, some teachers feel compelled to try their hand at the craft of writing. After their initial publishing success, some teachers leave their posts to become full-time authors while authors moonlight, working on their writing at night or during summers while continuing to teach. These teacher authors do amazing work, often writing for the kids they love to teach.\n\nHere are 12 authors who are also teachers. They have written books that might very well be familiar to your students. Check them out, add them to your summer reading list, and who knows? You might be inspired to try your own hand at writing the next great novel for your own students.\n\nJust so you know, we may get a small share of the sales made through affiliate links on this page.\n\nRick Riordan\n\nSee Rick Riordan’s Amazon page to view his best reads.\n\nElizabeth Acevedo\n\nCheck out her Amazon page to find out more.\n\nEoin Colfer\n\nSee Colfer’s books on his Amazon page.\n\nPhilip Pullman\n\nLearn more on his Amazon page.\n\nKate Messner\n\nCheck out her numerous works on her Amazon page.\n\nMichael Morpurgo\n\nSee his Amazon page for more details.\n\nSamira Ahmed\n\nClick here to view her Amazon page.\n\nLisabeth Posthuma\n\nFind out more on her Amazon page.\n\nLynda Mullaly Hunt\n\nFind out more on her Amazon page.\n\nZeena M.
