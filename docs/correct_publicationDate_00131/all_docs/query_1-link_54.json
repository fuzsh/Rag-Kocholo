        "text": "Biography of Tim McLaughlin\n\nAdapted from author's website\n\nTim McLaughlin is a Canadian artist, writer and photographer. He authored numerous works of electronic literature, including Notes Toward Absolute Zero and 25 Ways to Close a Photograph. Currently, he is active in the production of small batches of traditional hand-made inks. He also teaches ink making and researches natural dye use.\n\nIn partnership with Charllotte Kwon and Maiwa Handprints, Tim documents artisan communities and advocates for the importance and continuation of traditional craft and culture. This collaboration provides the moment to take both writing and photographic work into new areas and to work on larger projects. Recently, Charllotte and Tim worked together to produce Textiles of the Banjara: Cloth and Culture of a Wandering Tribe, published by Thames and Hudson, 2016.\n\nOver the years Tim has been active in experimental radio, hypertext fiction (he is included in the Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada), graphic design, book production, and documentary film. In his photographic work Tim McLaughlin is drawn to portraiture. In 2014 his book Portraits Found and Taken was awarded silver in the PX3 Paris Photo Prize. Between 2013 and 2015 he ran Image on Paper, a collection of photographic essays and reviews.\n\nEditions and Versions of Notes Toward Absolute Zero\n\nPrint Editions\n\n✭ 1993 Edition.
