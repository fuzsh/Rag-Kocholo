        "text": "3-5: Absolute and Relative Change\n\nPercent Change\n\nWhen relative change is written as a percent, it is telling us the percent of change from the original value. That change could be an increase or a decrease, so we are really finding the percent increase or the percent decrease from a starting value.\n\nIf the change from the reference value to the new value is from a larger number to a smaller number, the absolute change will be a negative number. Consequently, the percentage change, (the absolute change) ÷ (the reference value), will be a negative percentage. To express the percentage change, we either say that the percentage change is a negative percentage, or we say that it has a percentage decrease using a positive percentage. This is because the word decrease substitutes for the negative sign of the negative percentage change. For example, we can either say, “the percentage change is –20%”, or, “it has a percentage decrease of 20%”.\n\nIn this section, we will take what we have learned and apply the concepts to new situations.\n\nIn this section, we will use what we have learned so far to practice skill problems."
