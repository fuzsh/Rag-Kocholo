        "text": "Karel Čapek was famous czech writer, playwright, journalist, critic and one of the closest friends of the first czechoslovakian president Tomáš G. Masaryk. Čapek has become best known for his science fiction, including his novel War with the Newts (1936) and play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots, 1920), which introduced the word robot. He also wrote many politically charged works dealing with the social turmoil of his time. Influenced by American pragmatic liberalism, he campaigned in favor of free expression and strongly opposed the rise of both fascism and communism in Europe.[4][5]\n\nThough nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times, Čapek never received it. However, several awards commemorate his name,such as the Karel Čapek Prize, awarded every other year by the Czech PEN Club for literary work that contributes to reinforcing or maintaining democratic and humanist values in society. He also played a key role in establishing the Czechoslovak PEN Club as a part of International PEN\n\nČapek died on the brink of World War II as the result of a lifelong medical condition. His legacy as a literary figure became well established after the war."
