        "text": "AN ABSOLUTE MUST-READ - by inspiring author and INSEAD professor Erin Meyer - for anyone who works in an international environment! Why do the French and Germans generally like to debate topics so much? It might have to do with Descartes and Hegel. Why do the Chinese often try to look at the bigger picture? It might have to do with Confucius. Why do the Swedes often look to build consensus? It might have to do with the Vikings and egalitarianism. A truly illustrative example I enjoyed from the book, was a survey conducted by the author: \"In order for you to feel a meeting was a great success, which of the following should happen? A. In a good meeting, a decision is made B. In a good meeting, various viewpoints are discussed and debated C. In a good meeting, a formal stamp is put on a decision that has been made before the meeting The large majority of Americans responding to this question chose option A. The French, however, largely chose option B. And most Chinese and Japanese selected option C.\" Professor Meyer does a fantastic job - using real-world vignettes and relevant case studies - to examine how different cultures behave across eight key dimensions: Communicating, Evaluating, Persuading, Leading, Deciding, Trusting, Disagreeing, and Scheduling. She then provides useful recommendations on how to engage best when you find yourself in cross-culture situations where tensions arise due to precisely these characteristics. In the end, you're able to build a \"culture map\" to identify where the biggest sources of conflict might be for your specific situation. My only regret - being an American who lives abroad and works in a highly international environment - is that I didn't read the book ten years ago when it first came out! A big thanks to Pierrick M. P., who recommended this fantastic read (and how non-hierarchical of him to do so) and, of course, to Professor Meyer for this insightful journey. As she so appropriately concluded the book, \"... as globalization transforms the way we work, we now need the ability to decode cultural differences in order to work effectively with clients, suppliers, and colleagues from around the world. Challenging? Yes! But it's also fascinating. The range of human cultures can be a source of endless surprise and discovery - a fount of remarkable experiences and continual learning that can never be exhausted.\""
