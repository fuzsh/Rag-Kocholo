Each figure engages in obsessive and absurd acts, which—depending on who controls the narrative— could be genius or madness, so often indistinguishable. Countless minor characters also appear, intersecting with these stories in a suggestion of infinite parallel narratives.\n\nThe title predestines this philosophical, political, historical, literary, sentimental, erotic, religious, scientific and artistic book to evocative incompleteness. To attempt perfection is a joyful act of throwing oneself into the world, the task at hand is not to capture life but create, in and through words. Poised on the edge of something between reality and its negation, Daniel Guebel's The Absolute is an undeniable masterpiece even as it questions if the novel is a failed project.\n\nWinner of Premio Municipal de la Novela, 2021\n\nWinner of Premio Nacional de Literatura Argentina, 2018\n\nWinner of Premio Literario de la Academia Argentina de Letras, 2017\n\nWinner of Best Novel Award by La Nación, 2016\n\nBuying options\n\nPaperback\n\n$13.96\n\n$19.95\n\nISBN: 9781644211601\n\nPages: 336\n\nEbook\n\n$7.79\n\n$12.99\n\nISBN: 9781644211618\n\nPages: 336\n\nDaniel Guebel has published over twenty-five books, including novels, short stories and plays. He won Argentina’s National Literature Prize as well as the Argentine Academy of Letters’ novel prize. The Absolute was chosen by La Nación newspaper as its book of the year and The Emperor’s Pearl won the Emecé Prize. His autobiographical book The Jewish Son also won the Buenos Aires Book Fair’s award for literary criticism. Guebel’s latest novel is A Japanese Crime. A lover of Japanese literature, he owns a sushi restaurant."
