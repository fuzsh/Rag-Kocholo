        "text": "The Absolute as Large\n\nby Karl Kapek\n\nReview by Glenn Frantz\n\nThe Absolute at Large (1922) is one of the better novels by Czechoslovakian writer Karl Capek. An inventor builds a \"Karburetor\" which can convert matter completely into energy. Unfortunately, he discovers that the pantheistic doctrine that \"God is all things\" is literally true; therefore, when matter is destroyed, a certain amount of divine principle (\"the absolute\") is released. Persons who get a dose of this holy radiation become highly religious, begin preaching, and in extreme cases, heal the sick and perform miracles. Undaunted, an unscrupulous industrialist mass-produces the Karburetors and the cataclysm that results is farcical, satirical, and highly amusing.\n\nReturn to Review Indexes by author or reviewer.\n\nClick here to return to the SIGMA mainpage."
