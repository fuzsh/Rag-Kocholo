        "text": "The word \"robot\" comes from the Czech word robota, meaning drudgery, servitude, or forced labor. Čapek's brother and occasional collaborator Josef supplied this influential feature of the work.\n\nAct I is set at the factory office where Domin dictates business letters to his secretary Sulla, who will turn out to be a robot. Damaged robots are considered \"spoiled freight\" (1). The daughter of the \"President\" visits; Helena Glory gets to say very little, and nothing that isn't already anticipated by the hyper Domin who interrupts her repeatedly. It's interesting that the backstory \"info-dump\" takes place without Domin's interest or attention, even while he's delivering it. Instead, we are supposed to understand that he is immediately smitten with Helena. 1920 is long ago in this play, when old Rossum messed around with synthetic protoplasm and invented, in 1932, a substance with which he could create life forms. \"He could have produced a Medusa with the brain of a Socrates or a worm fifty yards long. But being without a grain of humor, he took it into his head to make a vertibrate or perhaps a man\" (4). Rossum's efficient son turned the process industrial, and it's an interesting aside that we learn \"The school books are full of paid advertisements\" (5). Helena's intention is to rabble-rouse, to preach \"human rights\" to the robots, but she is astounded that Sulla is a robot and that the other managers are not. The robots seem to have no self-interest, nor any instinct for self-preservation, as they speak dispassionately about being sent to the \"stamping-mill.\" Domin and company have no worries about Helena's initial intentions; obviously many such attempts have been made before: \"Every ship brings us more. Missionaries, anarchists, Salvation Army, all sorts. It's astonishing what a number of churches and idiots there are in the world\" (12). Dr. Gall wants to include pain in the creation of the robots, for purely and blindly industrial reasons. With robots flooding the labor force, the managers rhapsodize about a utopian future: \"Everyone will be free from worry and liberated from the degradation of labor. Everyone will live only to perfect himself\" (15), this despite warnings from Alquist (16). Ironically, the managers jump at the chance to cook their own lunch. With farcical abruptness, Domin asks Helena to marry him (17). She offers some over-the-top melodramatic reluctance, but soon the others are congratulating the engaged couple as the curtain rings down. Obviously we can't really take these characters seriously. We end up with piles of melodramatic clichés mixing inappropriately with the science-fiction socioecomic commentary. It's satire for now, but remaining acts change the mood.\n\nAct II is set ten years later at Helena and Domin's home. All are preparing to celebrate the couple's anniversary and are obviously shielding Helena from troubling world news regarding the Robots in rebellion. The human maid Nana is superstitiously disdainful of the Robots, but is also a semi-literate pain in the ass. How romantic! Domin bought his wife a gunboat for their anniversary. Radius, the librarian Robot, has gone berserk, but Helena excuses him from the stamping-mill (27). We also learn that the human race has gone reproductively sterile (so the work is not so bleak after all). By the end of the act, the Robots, obeying a manifesto insisting on the elimination of humans, have surrounded the house.\n\nThe pressures of being surrounded by menacing and presumably murderous Robots in Act III bring about some desperate behavior but very little regret over manufacturing decisions of the past. Domin hopes to negotiate with Rossum's plans so that the Robots can create more of their species, but Helena has recently burnt all useful documents. Busman idiotically thinks half a billion dollars will buy their freedom, but he electrocutes himself at the fence. Eventually the power goes down, the Robots enter, and they kill all the humans except for Alquist who \"works with his hands like the Robots\" (49).\n\nIn an Epilogue, Alquist agonizes over indecipherable documents and his inability to reconstruct the method for creating the Robots. Radius promises anything and is even willing to sacrifice himself to the dissecting room, but Alquist is powerless. He witnesses, however, the self-sacrificing love between a Robot named Primus and the Robot Helena that Dr. Gall had made. Rather than dissect either, Alquist calls them Adam and Eve and sends them on their way (58)."
