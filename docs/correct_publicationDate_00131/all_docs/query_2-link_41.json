        "text": "Profession: Writer, Playwright and Critic\n\nBiography: Karel Čapek was a Czech writer who introduced the term \"robot\" through his play R.U.R. (1920). Čapek's literature spanned various genres, reflecting democratic values and critiquing totalitarian systems.\n\nKarel Čapek’s journalistic beginnings intertwined with his involvement in Czechoslovakia's intellectual circles and early political developments. As a close associate of President T. G. Masaryk, Čapek's writings often explored the sociopolitical landscape, influenced by his exclusion from World War I due to health issues.\n\nAchieving literary prominence through R.U.R. (1920), he also authored mystery novels, speculative fiction, and fairy tales. His engagement with democratic advocacy fueled his literary voice against rising fascism and communism in the 1930s.\n\nČapek's personal life involved a late marriage to Olga Scheinpflugová in 1935. Committed to his homeland, he stayed in Czechoslovakia despite the looming Nazi threat, leading to his death from pneumonia in 1938.\n\nPosthumously, his writing, including significant works such as War with the Newts (1936) and The Insect Play (1921), would continue to echo his humanist values and deep-rooted concerns for society's direction.\n\nČapek's lexical innovation came from the word \"robot,\" derived from Slavic roots, coined in his play R.U.R. and suggested by his brother Josef Čapek. His influence endured through numerous translations, adaptations of his work, and honors such as the Karel Čapek Prize and the asteroid 1931 Čapek.\n\nBorn: January 9, 1890\n\nBirthplace: Malé Svatoňovice, Hungary\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Capricorn"
