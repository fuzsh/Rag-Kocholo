        "text": "November 6, 2008\n\nDavid Baldacci's Absolute Power has a decent story, but it was hard for me to enjoy because I found the writing so hackneyed that it distracted me from the plot. Here's a representative descriptive passage:\n\nAt the sound of the explosion, the playing stopped as three pairs of eyes turned as one toward the house. In another minute they were inside. It only took one more minute for the screams to be heard. The quiet neighborhood was no more.\n\nForget, for a moment, the clumsy use of the passive voice in the first sentence, and focus instead on the bizarre description of three people as \"three pairs of eyes.\" Not only is this unnecessary, it leads to the possibility of unintentional humor in the second sentence--\"In another minute they were inside\"--since one can interpret this as six disembodied eyes floating into the house. And the final sentence is terrible. Not only is it an unnecessary addition to the paragraph, it doesn't make logical sense. The quiet of the neighborhood may be disturbed, but the neighborhood itself still exists. Saying that \"The quiet neighborhood was no more\" makes it sounds as if the neighborhood has been incinerated by a hydrogen bomb.\n\nBaldacci's dialogue is bad, too. Here's an example:\n\n\"Jack, do you have any idea who's behind all this?\"\n\nJack shook his head, a small groan escaping his lips. \"I've got a bunch of loose threads sliding around in my head but none of them have added up to spit so far. I'm hoping that status will change. Soon.\"\n\nIf there is any English-speaking person in the world who speaks that way while under duress, I have yet to meet them.\n\nAnd here's one final example of exactly what I don't like about Baldacci's prose:\n\nShe still stood there several minutes after he left. A series of emotions competed for space across her face, none, in the end, winning out.\n\nThe unintentional rhyming of \"space\" with \"face\" is distracting. Also, Baldacci uses a lot of words to essentially tell the reader nothing. A character seems to experience a number of emotions--none of which are specifically described--before eventually experiencing none. Is that the idea Baldacci wishes to convey? Does he even know what idea he wishes to convey about his characters or the situations in which they find themselves most of the time? It didn't seem to me as if he did.\n\nIf you've seen previews for the film version of Absolute Power or read the flap copy, you know what it's about. I suppose it could be an enjoyable potboiler if you're able to turn off the critical part of your mind that notices clumsy writing and consume the story in the fashion one consumes an entire bag of chips in one sitting, but for me, the writing was so bad it was distracting. And trust me. I read some pretty bad books.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n*Spoiler Alert*\n\nI read this some 15 years ago and it's a must for all lovers of thriller and sinister suspense books.\n\nIt really is an adrenaline filled read, starting from the first chapter where Luther, a petty thief, witnesses the POTUS committing murder. Thereon, it's a race to ensure he does not become the next victim.\n\nAbsolute Power and The Winner are, undoubtedly, some of Baldacci's best work.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\n4 to 4.5 stars\n\nIt has been a long time since I got this into a political thriller. It has a very good plot that drew me in right away and kept me interested throughout. If I had any complaints it might be that the resolution felt sudden and a bit convenient without the same height of intensity as the rest of the book, but still better than a lot of endings I have read. The story is mid-90s so some things might feel a bit dated, but not distractingly so.\n\nI listened to this one and it is a Scott Brick narration. He is my favorite audiobook reader, so it was a delight to hear his voice again. If they suddenly said Scott Brick will be the only audiobook narrator going forward, I would be fine with that.\n\nThis was first book Baldacci wrote and the second of his that I read. He definitely started off on a high note! I did not care much for the other one I listened to (Memory Man – and I think the audio had something to do with that). I am planning to try more by him, but I am hoping that it isn’t a case of him starting with his best and it is all downhill from here!\n\nIf you are political thriller fan, haven’t tried Baldacci, and need a guaranteed win, you should give Absolute Power a try.\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nLike many of the reviewers of this book I did like the set up where a burglar watches a murder from another room with a one-way mirror. His major problem thereafter is that the murderer is the President of the USA. The poor burglar does not stand a chance whatever he does. A great premise but it is followed by far too many players and too many scenarios. Eventually I was looking forward to when it stopped.\n\nNevertheless I persevered just wishing there was a little less of everything. Not the best book I have read from Baldacci by a long shot but it was okay. I tend to feel that a really good editor could have reduced the 550 pages to about 350 and it would have been a very good read indeed.\n\nNovember 9, 2019\n\nLoved the movie, apparently the book a little less. Still entertaining read.\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n\"Puterea absoluta\" este cel mai cunoscut roman al autorului, fiind un bestseller international. A fost ecranizat in 1997 cu excelentii Clint Eastwood si Gene Hackman in rolurile principale. Cand cineva trebuie sa joace rolul de ticalos Gene Hackman este mereu la post. Si-i iese de minune.\n\nDe obicei cand auzim despre putere absoluta ne gandim la persoana care ar putea s-o detina si exista una singura cu acest privilegiu: presedintele Statelor Unite. Pozitia sa este unica si protejata, fiind foarte greu de imaginat ca acesta ar putea fi anchetat sau pus sub invinuire pentru o fapta penala. Asadar puterea absoluta poate implica si imunitatea absoluta.\n\nIn ceea ce priveste actiunea, il avem in prim plan pe Luther Whitney, care are 66 de ani si a fost hot toata viata lui. Deviza sa este sa fure numai de la cei care-si pot permite sa piarda ceea ce sustrage el. Fusese de 3 ori inchis si dorea sa dea o ultima lovitura care sa-l trimita undeva, intr-o tara calda cu palmieri. A pus asadar ochii pe un conac imens pe care a decis sa-l praduiasca.\n\nInsa, desi era hot cu experienta, nu va fi pregatit pentru ceea ce-l asteapta acolo: va deveni martorul unei crime oribile. Pitit fiind in camera seif a locuintei el va asista la o scena de sex brutala, mai apoi la moartea unei femei. Insa ceea ce-l va soca cel mai mult este ca il va recunoaste pe barbatul in cauza ca fiind Alan J. Richmond, presedintele SUA. Mai mult, el va reusi sa plece de la conac cu o dovada incontestabila, un cutit cu amprentele presedintelui pe el.\n\nCare este mutarea logica, morala si corecta pentru a rezolva aceasta ecuatie? Sa mearga la politie si sa se autodenunte spunand tot ce a vazut? Sa faca singur dreptate? Sau sa uite totul ca si cum nimic nu s-ar fi intamplat?\n\nOrice ar decide lucrurile nu sunt simple pentru ca in scena intra si abilul si corectul detectiv Seth Frank, ambitioasa sefa de cabinet a presedintelui Gloria Russel, simpaticul avocat Jack Graham si procuroarea feroce Kate Whitney, nimeni alta decat fiica lui Luther.\n\nCine va castiga? Poate fi infranta puterea absoluta? Ramane sa aflati citind romanul.\n\nMi-a ramas in minte un citat interesant despre luna de miere: \"Eu si Julie am cheltuit 20 de dolari pentru casatorie, incluzand in asta si luna de miere. Am platit un judecator de pace cu 10 dolari, cu restul am cumparat o lada de Michelob, apoi ne-am dus cu Harley-ul pana la Miami si am dormit pe plaja. Ne-am distrat de minune.\"\n\nDesigur, carcotasa din fire, eu mi-am pus urmatoarele intrebari: cat a costat combustibilul pana in Miami? Cine i-a lasat sa doarma pe plaja - care nu e chiar Vama Veche de la noi? Unde s-a consumat luna de miere, in conditiile in care toti octogenarii instariti sunt acolo inarmati cu binocluri? S-au dat cu lotiune de plaja? Si cel mai important - si-au luat magneti de frigider cu \"I ♡ Miami\" ? :)\n\nAvem asadar de a face cu un roman foarte bine scris, complex, cu o intriga politista captivanta si interesanta, capabila sa mentina interesul cititorului pe termen lung. Baldacci este intr-adevar un maestru al thrillerului.\n\nIn incheiere atasez cateva citate care mi s-au parut interesante de retinut:\n\n\"Planificase totul, dar in \"meseria\" asta regula era ca nu puteai niciodata sa prevezi totul.\"\n\n\"Ei, uneori, nu obtii ce-ti doresti, iar uneori obtii mai mult decat vrei.\"\n\n\"E suficient sa iei o carte, ca sa se prabuseasca intregul castel din carti de joc.\"\n\n\"... singura asigurare pe care o are un avocat sunt clientii pe care-i controleaza. Nimeni nu te invata asta la Facultatea de Drept.\"\n\n\"Asta era unul dintre lucrurile minunate legate de Casa Alba: nimeni nu stia cati bani trebuia sa cheltui pentru cladirea aia.\"\n\n\"Jack, nu te gandi prea mult. Uneori, nu-i un lucru prea sanatos.\"\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nThe story was entertaining, but to me the writing was a little weird. Perhaps I’m just not well acquainted enough with the author, but I found the writing to be both simplistic and bloated. I didn’t really think the dialogue was that great either. It was still a decent read.\n\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nThis is Baldacci's first thriller, and my printing includes a five page explanation of how the author was a highly paid but junior attorney, working long and hard on corporate drudgery while trying to be a screen writer. I should write a novel! Sure, that's gotta be easier than a screen play. The result is 'Absolute Power.' It's a good story--the President is a misogynist womanizer, and a married woman he's trying to screw is killed by the secret service when she defends herself against the Pres. But unknown to the Pres and attendees, a burglar is hiding in the house and witnesses the killing. Did Baldacci read 'The Burglar in the Closet' by Lawrence Block? Seems like he might have; it's the same story (only not the President.)\n\nBaldacci has the Hollywood feel for a thriller--twists, subplots, everybody screwing everybody else. This would be a good read except for the flood of over-writing. If there were a section in 'The Elements of Style' by Strunk and White devoted to over-writing, Baldacci's picture would lead the pages. In the sentences, in the dialogue, in the description, in the scenes, in the chapters, everywhere and at every level. From the smallest level where the bad guy jumps 'quickly' from the window (ever seen somebody jump slowly?) to the structure of having the same characters muse about the same horrors five or six times across ten chapters, then have them explain the horrors to other characters as though nobody had heard the news. On top of this, the omniscient narrator has to chime in with a clumsy, over-dramatic commentary (this was a death, a horrible death, that she would not be able to process for a long time.) The characters must listen to the author, because they frequently adopt his tone--instead of thinking, 'I could be next!' they think 'there was the possibility that I could suffer a similar fate, end up in that fateful position, covered by six feet of dark earth, forever cold and still.' All of this kills the tension whenever it arises, disrupts the emotions, and makes it more of a chore to read what is a ridiculously long book. It's like watching a broadcast-TV show, interrupted by commercials. Once the show resumes, it takes a few minutes to get back into the scene, back to the tension. And then another commercial comes along. Huh. Maybe after failing at movie writing, Baldacci should have tried TV scripts.\n\nSeptember 10, 2022\n\nIMDb - credit to Baldacci book used for movie\n\nYouTube - Official Movie trailer\n\nMovie with Clint Eastwood\n\nEnding song (5:00) - added March 1, 2019\n\nA Virginia Burglar, Luther Whitney(66 - Clint Eastwood in the movie) made a surveillance & break into the Sullivan family's rich home. US President, Alan Richmond(40 - Gene Hackman in the movie) takes drunk Christine Sullivan to her house for sex. From a closet in her house, Luther watches them fight, Alan's slashed with letter opener & Christine's killed by 2 Secret Service men, Tim Collin & Bill Burton. Gloria Russell(37), President Chief of Staff took the \"bloodstained\" letter opener, Luther escaped with evidence. Could Luther get evidence to Walter Sullivan(husband)?\n\nCan Agent Burton & Colin be considered \"subordinate\" ordered killers against Luther & Walter? Can Gloria testify against president? Does presidential power - stop impeachment & death penality options?\n\nFYI: Major characters above are in the movie but the book's end is different than the movie with Clint Eastwood.\n\nDecember 22, 2012\n\nI loved this book, it grabbed me from the start and made me want to continue reading.\n\nA well-crafted story, strong characters that are believable and easy to visualise. An interesting story line that is different to the usual thrillers. Lots of twists and turns and worth the read.\n\nMay 20, 2018\n\nWelp, I finally got around to reading the book that started it all. I remember seeing the movie back in '95 and seeing it because it had Clint Eastwood in it. After roughly 25(?) years, I read this book and it didn't disappoint.\n\nThe story is a bit dull by today's standards but given its context, it came out during the Clinton era, I think it is quite courageous and interesting. Of course, this has been reused multiple times; even by Baldacci himself (First Family comes to mind). The characters are good and almost all of them have their arc, which is excellent writing.\n\nI felt a bit let down by the ending though. I am not getting into spoilers but let's just say that when you read it, you will be wondering what the purpose of the third act was.\n\nAnyway, it is the journey that matters and Absolute Power does not disappoint.\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\n“The President of the United States was a drunk, an adulterer, and a woman beater.”\n\n“He smiled to the press, kissed babies and flirted with enchanted old women, held important meetings, flew around the world as his country’s leader, and he was a fucking asshole who screwed married women, then beat them up and then got them killed.”\n\nNo doubt about it. David Baldacci’s fame today as one of the world’s premier thriller authors started right out of the gate with a jaw dropping debut. In an instance of almost blinding prescience, ABSOLUTE POWER posited criminality in the oval office, political cover-ups and the gritty all important question as to how far the administration of the White House would go to protect the occupant of the Oval Office as a matter of political necessity.\n\nI wonder if Baldacci wakes up these days, reads the morning news about a president already proven to be a con man, a grifter, a thief and a rapist facing 91 criminal indictments, and shakes his head over the extent to which even the most outlandish ideas in fiction seem to ultimately be overshadowed and outdone by reality.\n\nABSOLUTE POWER might have benefited from a moderate amount of editorial trimming but there’s no doubt it was an eyebrow raising suspense thriller when it was published 30 years ago and it seems even more timely and important today. Definitely recommended.\n\nPaul Weiss\n\nDecember 31, 2013\n\n\"Absolute Power\" illustrates what it is I like best about David Baldacci's books: the perfect balance and blend of action and storyline. Rare is the storyteller that can capture the attention of my military fiction loving - action-craving husband, and at the same time provide enough compelling plot and character development to have me turning pages long into the night.\n\nWith the exception of his \"Camel Club\" series (if you haven't read them - run - go - find them now), \"Absolute Power\" is my favorite Baldacci book. Set in our nation's capitol, the story begins with an unspeakable act committed by a man at the pinnacle of Washington power. His entourage thinks - if only briefly - that they have matters under control. Only moments pass before they come to the horrendous conclusion that a silent witness to the crime now has in his possession the means to destroy them all.\n\nAs always, Baldacci's characters are complicated. The traditional \"bad guy\" turns out not to be so bad after all; and, the one looked up to by millions, lacks even the most basic modicum of decency,morality and conscience.\n\nThere is a little love story thrown in, perhaps to provide a moment or two for a reader to catch a quick breath.\n\n\"Absolute Power\" was made into a movie starring Clint Eastwood. Seldom does a movie live up to the book and this one was no exception. However, I paid to see it years ago, and I felt like it was worth the money. You can catch it now - every once in awhile - on late night cable.\n\nNovember 20, 2014\n\nI've enjoyed books by Baldacci in the past, but this one is awful. First, the writing is garbage: it reads at a fifth-grade level, uses fifth grade vocabulary (+ cussing), is frequently grammatically incorrect, and consists of cliched, trite, unoriginal phrasings.\n\nSecond, Baldacci comes off as arrogant, misogynistic, morbidly fascinated by violence, especially against women, and overall like a person I would definitely NOT want to know; yes, his characters are detestable, but his *enjoyment* in recounting their flaws and failings in such a dramatic story-line only (to me) serves to put the author himself on display as someone who salivates over either the misfortune of others, or in general is a vengeful person who wants a certain type of person taken down as violently as possible, or is someone who is a sadist himself.\n\nThird, the story-line has so many holes--which demonstrates Baldacci's lack of knowledge on the topics he's writing about; I didn't buy so many of the story elements; for example, in describing the way Jack the lawyer got a big deal at his law firm, his explanations were entirely superficial and could have been written by anyone who was not a lawyer, or a business person, and who had not done ANY research on the topic. In ALL the details he provided, about law, the White House, police procedure, etc, Baldacci tried to obfuscate his lack of expertise in opaque and fuzzy dialogue, but in the end, I was left feeling that I learned nothing from his descriptions.\n\nRarely do I feel less literate after reading a book, but that's how I feel after Absolute Power...\n\nFebruary 15, 2020\n\nThis is the author's first book and also my introduction to this author. I do know that he is popular and an accomplished author as I have seen his books thru my Goodreads feed. In this one, Luther is a career burglar and has planned rather meticulously a high stakes job. All his forethought could not have predicted what actually happens and he soon finds himself on the run from an unbelievable opponent.\n\nThis book is a thriller book and the opening act opens with a bang. Immediately I was engrossed with this book as the opening act demands that you pay attention to this book. While reading this opening act I knew I was in for a terrific ride. I did think the second act slowed the pace down a bit as the author provides us with background information for a bunch of characters. There might been too much information and characters and this did affect my overall rating. But when the chase and the conspiracy kicks back into gear again I could not put down the book as I wanted to know the outcome of everything. There were several twists in this book that did catch me off guard and I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nIf you enjoy books that are part of the thriller genre this is one that you should read. I was involved from the beginning pages to the very end. Like I said this was my introduction to this author and it will not be my last time reading his work. I know what I am doing tonight. I am watching the movie based on this book as I look forward to the visual form of this work.\n\nMarch 5, 2017\n\nMeh. Relatively quick-paced action, clichéd kind of mystery thriller crime guns Yank stuff. The distraction I needed but nothing more substantial. For what it is it is pretty much a 5-star thing, but in my opinion it is hardly that.\n\nApril 6, 2018\n\nRead it when it came out and liked it well enough but was put off with the structure, didn't like the protagonist getting killed off and another character picking up the narrative.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nConsidering this book came out over 25 years ago, and was Baldacci's first novel, I was impressed. The originality of the plot is the key to this book's success: a cat burglar inadvertently witnesses the shooting of the president's mistress by the Secret Service, a situation ripe for a cover up, a cover up that puts the hapless burglar's life in jeopardy. I, like so many others, have seen the Clint Eastwood movie, which I enjoyed, but the book is more complicated with more twists and turns.\n\nWhat I didn't like about it was the overly wordy backgrounds of the characters expressed by the omniscient narrator, and if this had been trimmed it would have made the book a bit shorter than it was. However, this was the style of the mid-nineties, and one could hardly fault Balducci's ambitious attempt in his debut novel. Worth reading.\n\nJuly 22, 2021\n\nI like this book a lot. I read this over two plane trips separated by about two months. It was an interesting and suspenseful thriller. It got to the point that I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to watching (and being disappointed by) the movie. Isn't it always true what people say... \"the book was better than the movie\".\n\nSeptember 11, 2014\n\nI haven't read anything by Mr Balducci for quite some time and I must say that I selected the right novel to get back to this author's style. It was exciting, thrilling, and had more than a touch of believability. A real page turner as the author kept the reader engrossed in the lives of each and every character from the power seekers in DC, including the president, to the the common man. It does make one think of what power lies in the office of the president and Mr Balducci makes you think a lot about that absolute power.\n\nSuffice to say, this was a thriller and one that I would recommend most highly to anyone who enjoys suspense and the allure of the power seekers.\n\nJune 14, 2016\n\nThis was a real page turner I couldn't put it down, as with all political thrillers they can be difficult to follow at times and this was no exception but the story was brilliant and I really enjoyed it. I'd seen the film many years before and could only remember bits of it so not sure how much it ties to the book but I know I did enjoy watching it. I would recommend this book, it is quite long but powerful and a real eye opener into the world of Americal presidential politics.\n\nDecember 4, 2012\n\nSomehow I missed this book when I started reading Baldacci. I am glad I saw it on Goodreads! It was a page turner from the start to the end. If you haven't read it,put it on top of your \"to read\" list!\n\nDecember 15, 2015\n\nREVIEW OF AUDIOBOOK; DECEMBER 4, 2015\n\nNarrator: Scott Brick\n\nI was thrilled by this book right up to 70%. Then I began to tire, then wilt, then couldn't wait for it to end. The problem I have with Baldacci's first book is that it didn't have enough - or any! \"hero\" moments - those scenes where the hero comes to the rescue and the audience claps (at least, in Asia back in the 60s) or the US cavalry finally came. There was none of that here. The evil POTUS had the upper hand all the way and the good guys limped their way to the finishing line.\n\nI hope this uneven treatment is only because it's the author's debut work and that in his later books, he manages to strike that magic balance between reality and entertaining fiction. As a member of the audience, I must feel as if the hero is winning, even if bad things happen to him or the villain looks like he's winning. In Absolute Power, I felt (in the last 25%) let down by the fact that there were no clap-worthy hero moments and the book whimpered to its ending in the pedestrian epilogue.\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nLate to the game I know. Love DB. WASN'T a fan of the length of the book, but it was worth every word. Solid 4.5 stars!!!\n\nWhen a president does all he can to cover up his philandering.... it only goes downhill from there....🫣\n\nNovember 30, 2013\n\nThis is the book that got David Baldacci started in his writing career and for a first book I thought it was his best. I'd seen the movie Absolute Power with Clint Eastwood then I'd decided to read the book and I thought the book was a lot better. It follows the same plot line as the movie but it has many differences in it. It's about a long time thief named Luther Whitney who is in the middle of robbing a rich couple's home and he witnesses a murder and the man involved with it is the President of the United States. The book was very hard to put down and full of many twists and turns.\n\nDecember 22, 2020\n\nThe pure power of a well-executed idea.\n\nSeptember 21, 2016\n\nA chilling plot with many twists and turns. David Baldacci is an engaging storyteller. Definitely want to read some more of his books.\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nThis books review challenge is:\n\nIs the author open to all sides of the argument or is there an agenda?\n\nI guess that the agenda would be summed up in the books Title. Absolute Power certainly says it all. This President believed he had Absolute Power to kill anyone who is in the way of his next election\n\nBut, he wasn’t counting on one burgler taking him down dead or alive.\n\nGreat book, yes, it’s fiction, but certainly gives you lots to think about.\n\nDecember 6, 2015\n\nNot sure how I missed David Baldacci's first book, ABSOLUTE POWER! However, have seen the movie several times over the years with, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, and Ed Harris (1997). A career thief witnesses a horrific crime involving the U.S. President.\n\nFrom the mansion in Virginia, the sexual scandal, passion turned violent, a burglar behind a wall. Passion turns deadly involving the President of US. A witness. New meaning to the wrong place, at the wrong time. Corruption, conspiracy, scandal. An attorney. A wife. a Mistress. A thief. An estranged daughter. Secret Service. Homicide Cop. The media. Power. Danger. Why was the President here and the circumstances leading him here? Suspense, Mystery. Crime. Intrigue. A Coverup. A Political Crime Thriller!\n\nMany of you are aware I am a huge David Baldacci fan; however, I began my reading, with his newer, more recent books-- always anxiously awaiting the next in the series. Over the years, I typically choose audiobook format, in order to further enhance my reading experience with his books.\n\nWhile my book blog focuses on new and upcoming releases--currently read 95% advanced reading copies and upcoming new releases. However, when I find an author I enjoy, I will use Audible as a great resource to get my fix- to catch up with older books, I have missed along the way. Here I am going from the 30th, back to the first.\n\nHaving recently finished two of New York Times best-selling author's latest thrillers, landing on my top Books for 2015, MEMORY MAN, and THE GUILTY, (both 5 stars), I ran across a posting:\n\nTo celebrate the release of David Baldacci’s latest novel The Guilty, we find out more about the American thriller writer whose 30 adult novels have sold more than 110 million copies in more than 80 countries worldwide. Learn which of the author’s books are his personal favorites, and find out what it takes to master the depth of research that sets his works apart from the competition.\n\n“Thriller writer David Baldacci selects his own personal favorites out of his 30 bestsellers”: The Telegraph Nov 15, 2015 by David Baldacci: “My Best Five Novels”. When reading the posting, I was quite intrigued and fascinated. These are the books I want to read!\n\nABSOLUTE POWER (1996) First Novel\n\nTHE WINNER (1998)\n\nWISH YOU WELL (2001)\n\nTHE CAMEL CLUB (2005)\n\nMEMORY MAN (2015)\n\nWhen reviewing my own reading list, I had not read and purchased the audible books. ABSOLUTE POWER, offers a new recording (Jan 1, 2010) and cover—the first of the blockbuster thrillers by Baldacci---a book which changes the way you think about Washington. Of course since then, we have seen plenty of scandals; however, all this was prior to.\n\nBonus: What really makes this edition special, David tells his story at the beginning of the audio. We all think of him as the successful, talented author he is, and the place he has earned in the literary world, as an award- winning author. However, it was refreshing to hear how he transitioned from lawyer to writer. His hopes, childhood dreams, aspirations, and determination, despite his rejections. His writing passion and inspiration behind his first novel, ABSOLUTE POWER. Very moving and inspirational.\n\nHe has a truly remarkable gift, a talent. On behalf of all the Baldacci fans, bloggers, reviewers, and readers-- A special, thank you for your dedication and tenacity. Providing readers hours of reading, listening, and viewing entertainment. If you have missed his first novel, highly recommend the audio, narrated by Scott Brick. The book is even better than the movie. Check out the list.\n\nHappy 30th Anniversary!\n\nJDCMustReadBooks"
