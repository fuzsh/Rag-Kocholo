        "text": "Karel Èapek was born on January 9th, 1890 in the northwest part of Bohemia (Czech Republic) in the small town of Malé Svatoòovice. He was a prolific and talented writer who worked throughout his life as a novelist, a journalist, playwright, writer of childrens literature, and travelogue. Èapek was very close with his brother Josef, and the two brothers co-wrote many books and plays under the name Èapek Brothers. Since their childhood both Èapek brothers were influenced by Czech writers and folklorists such as K.J. Erben. Èapek suffered from a disease akin to severe arthritis that caused him severe pain. He was relieved of military duty during World War I, but he always advanced Czech ideals in his writing. He was active in politics during his later life and was a close friend with T. G. Masaryk. In addition to his literary career Capek was interested in gardening, travel, and photography and each of his interests influenced his writing. In 1920 Èapek met his future wife, Olga Scheinplungová, an actress. Due to Èapeks health they did not marry until 1935, only three years before his death. In the years before World War II Èapek actively warned the Czech public against Nazi Germany. He also actively sought the support of foreign nations. Unfortunately both Èapek and his brother died prematurely. Èapek died after a week of illness on December 25, 1938 and so was perhaps spared the persecution of the Nazis. His brother Josef died in the concentration camp Bergen-Belson in 1945, shortly before the war ended."
