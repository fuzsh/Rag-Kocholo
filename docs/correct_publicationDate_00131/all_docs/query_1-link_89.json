        "meta_description": "Background Linear regression of efficiency (LRE) introduced a new paradigm for real-time qPCR that enables large-scale absolute quantification by eliminating the need for standard curves. Developed through the application of sigmoidal mathematics to SYBR Green I-based assays, target quantity is derived directly from fluorescence readings within the central region of an amplification profile. However, a major challenge of implementing LRE quantification is the labor intensive nature of the analysis.   Findings Utilizing the extensive resources that are available for developing Java-based software, the LRE Analyzer was written using the NetBeans IDE, and is built on top of the modular architecture and windowing system provided by the NetBeans Platform. This fully featured desktop application determines the number of target molecules within a sample with little or no intervention by the user, in addition to providing extensive database capabilities. MS Excel is used to import data, allowing LRE quantification to be conducted with any real-time PCR instrument that provides access to the raw fluorescence readings. An extensive help set also provides an in-depth introduction to LRE, in addition to guidelines on how to implement LRE quantification.   Conclusions The LRE Analyzer provides the automated analysis and data storage capabilities required by large-scale qPCR projects wanting to exploit the many advantages of absolute quantification. Foremost is the universal perspective afforded by absolute quantification, which among other attributes, provides the ability to directly compare quantitative data produced by different assays and/or instruments. Furthermore, absolute quantification has important implications for gene expression profiling in that it provides the foundation for comparing transcript quantities produced by any gene with any other gene, within and between samples.",

        "text": "Optical read precision is critical for start cycle selection.\n\nAlthough a primary objective is to maximize the size of the LRE window by placing the start cycle as early in a profile as possible, optical read precision becomes a major limitation. This is because LRE analysis is based on determining cycle efficiency (EC), which is calculated by dividing the cycle fluorescence (FC) by the fluorescence reading produced by the preceding cycle (FC-1):\n\nDue to this ratio-based determination, the accuracy of EC determination is dependent on the precision of the fluorescence readings, which is generally referred to as “read precision”. The accuracy of cycle efficiency determination can thus be dramatically compromised when reaction fluorescence is below the lower limit of the instrument's optical capacity. Large differences in this lower limit between different instruments, combined with the arbitrary nature of the fluorescence units used in real-time PCR, presented major challenges for automated selection of the start cycle.\n\nThis prompted a default implementation based on a simple, albeit suboptimal method of designating the start cycle as the first cycle below C1/2. However, although this approach can be reasonably reliable using a number of reaction setups, an alternative method was developed that allows the lower limit of the LRE window to be manually specified. Based on entry of a “minimum FC”, the start cycle is set to the cycle following the first cycle that produces a FC greater than this minimum (i.e. the cycle from which the start cycle EC denominator is taken). The “LRE Window Selection Parameters” panel within the Profile Editor window allows the minimal FC and F0 threshold to be adjusted manually (Figure 9).\n\nA. Default settings in which the start cycle is set to the first cycle below C1/2 and the F0 threshold set to 6.0%, which is used to determine the top of the LRE window (see the text for details). This produces an average replicate F0 CV (Av Repl-Fo CV) of 29.0%, which is a general indicator of intra-run variance generated by LRE analysis (see the text for details). B. The minimum FC has been manually set to 225,000 fluorescence units, such that the start cycle is set to the cycle following the first cycle that generates a fluorescence reading above this minimum FC. This reduces the average replicate F0 CV to 25.2%. Note that the LRE Analyzer help set provides additional details about LRE window selection.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017636.g009\n\nDuring early implementation of the LRE window selection parameters, it became apparent that a method for assessing the overall quantitative precision could be useful. The approach taken was based on the variance of target quantities generated by technical replicates; that is, the CV of the F0 values produced by replicate profiles. Referred to as the “Av Repl-Fo CV”, averaging the quantitative variances generated by all the replicate reaction sets within a run, provided such a general assessment. This not only proved to be useful for selecting an optimal minimum FC, but also for assessing the overall performance of an assay. Although beyond the scope of this study, this has revealed, among other things, large differences in instrument performance, due primarily to differences in the optical precision they produce. A simple but generally effective method is to lower the minimum FC until the average replicate F0 CV reaches a minimum, although this should only be taken as a general guideline, as exceptions have been encountered.\n\nDefining the top of the LRE window via the F0 threshold.\n\nA major source of quantitative error discovered during early attempts to apply sigmoidal mathematics to PCR using nonlinear regression analysis (sigmoidal curve fitting or SCF) were distortions within the upper region of a profile [9]. In order to maximize quantitative accuracy, it was found essential to exclude such aberrant cycles from the analysis. The recursive nature of LRE analysis provided a simple method for identifying such aberrant cycles [5], which are apparent in both the FC and LRE plots (Figure 10).\n\nA common form of kinetic distortion, referred to as “plateau drift”, is produced by a continued increase in amplicon DNA quantity beyond that predicted by the LRE model, which is represented as circles within the upper panel (referred to as the FC plot). This is particularly evident in the LRE plot (lower panel) as a progressive drifting of points above the LRE line. Importantly, inclusion of these aberrant cycles in the LRE window (represented by the black circles in the LRE plot and the red circles in the FC plot) will generate an underestimation of Emax (Y-intercept) that leads to an overestimation of target quantity.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017636.g010\n\nAn important objective for setting the upper limit of the LRE window was thus to avoid inclusion of such aberrant cycles. An objective method came from taking the F0 value generated by the cycle immediately above the LRE window, and comparing it with the average F0 value generated by the cycles within the LRE window. If the difference is below a specified value, defined as the F0 threshold (Figure 9), the LRE window is expanded to include this next cycle and LRE analysis is repeated. This process is continued until a cycle is encountered that exceeds the F0 threshold. The Tabular Summary located within the profile editing panel provides a numerical perspective on the process (Figure 11).\n\nC: cycle number, FC: the fluorescence reading, EC: the cycle's amplification efficiency, %Av. Fo: the percent difference between the cycle F0 and the average F0 generated by the cycles within the LRE window (designated by the red font). In this example, the F0 threshold (Figure 9) was set to 6% so that cycle 29, which generated a 6.84% difference, triggered termination of LRE window expansion at cycle 28.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017636.g011\n\nAlthough an F0 threshold of 6% has generally been found to be effective, it should be noted that increasing the F0 threshold can lead to susceptibility to another form of kinetic distortion, referred to as “profile collapse” (Figure 12). In contrast to plateau drift that can generate underestimations of Emax, inclusion of collapsed cycles overestimates Emax, which in turn generates an underestimation of target quantity.\n\nIn this example the collapse is produced by the primer pair, although reduced enzymatic activity, such as that produced at high concentrations of SYBR Green I, have also been found to generate profile collapse for primer pairs that normally conform well to the LRE model. Similar to plateau drift (Figure 10), it is important to exclude such aberrant cycles from the LRE window, which for profile collapse will lead to an overestimation of Emax (Y-intercept), which will generate an underestimation of target quantity.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017636.g012"
