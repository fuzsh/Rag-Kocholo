        "text": "Czech novelist Karel Čapek (1890-1938) might be best known as the pioneering science fiction writer who first coined the term \"robot.\" But readers have long appreciated the transcendent humanity of his works. \"There was no writer like him,\" Arthur Miller once said, \"prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humor and hard-edged social satire: a unique combination...a joy to read.\" In this episode, Jacke talks to podcast producer Ian Coss about the life of Karel Čapek, his contributions to literature, and how Čapek's celebrated novel War with the Newts inspired Ian's audio fiction series Newts, a farcical, yet deadly serious tale about an alternate history of the 1930s, in which the Western world discovers, exploits, educates, arms, and is ultimately overthrown by a species of highly intelligent, three-foot tall salamanders. SPECIAL BONUS CONTENT: We conclude the episode with a trailer for Newts.\n\nAdditional listening suggestions:\n\n160 Ray Bradbury (with Carolyn Cohagan)\n\nMargaret Atwood\n\n282 Science Fiction\n\nSubscribe to Newts at the following links:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newts/id1621525265\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/4K7X2gY9MwYFWuXEdpyFC7\n\nStitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/show/newts\n\nGoogle Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcHJveHkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9uZXd0c3BvZGNhc3Q\n\nPocket Casts: https://pca.st/5kerq5l8\n\nPandora: https://www.pandora.com/podcast/newts/PC:80522\n\nRSS: https://feeds.feedburner.com/newtspodcast\n\nHelp support the History of Literature Podcast at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop.
