        "text": "Karel Capek is a Czech author, playwright, journalist and translator. He was the first Czech writer to become recognized worldwide.\n\nArthur Miller on Karel Capek: \"There was no writer like him... prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hard-edged social satire: a unique combination\"\n\nThe word ROBOT was first used in Karel Capek's play RUR (Rossum's Universal Robots). The word robot was invented by Capek's brother, Josef. It is derived from the Czech word meaning labour.\n\nKarel Capek almost received the Nobel Prize for literature but didn't because Sweden thought it ill-timed for fear from Hitler's reaction.\n\nKarel Capek was the third person on the Gestapo's list of people to be arrested after the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He decided to stay in Prague with the rest of the nation. The Gestapo never got him because he died on Dec. 25, 1938, three months before the invasion. His older brother Josef, was arrested by the Gestapo and died in the Terezin Concentration Camp in 1945.\n\nCapek's obituary in Newsweek (Jan. 2, 1939) said of R.U.R.: \"Although he believed it the least interesting of all his works, it brought him the greatest fame.\"\n\nKarel Capek was born on Jan. 9, 1890, in Male Svatonovice near Trutnov in Northeastern Bohemia and he died Dec. 25, 1938, in Prague. His father, Antonin Capek, was a doctor. His mother, Bozena Capkova, was a homemaker.\n\nIn the time preceeding the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia he used all his influence and connections trying to help save his country from the iminent danger of an attack. He fought until the end of his life, unfortunately in vain, to warn the Western powers to help ward off the threat of the rising aggressiveness of Nazi Germany. For this and other reasons, Karel Capek is beloved by most Czechs and Slovaks.\n\nYoung Capek\n\nKarel Capek was the third and last child born into the Capek family. He had an older sister, Helene, and an older brother, Josef.\n\n1895-1900\n\nCapek goes to elementary school in the town of Upice.\n\nFor two years he went to a local middle school.\n\n1901\n\nIn the fall, he moved with his grandmother to Hradec Kralove, the principal town of Eastern Bohemia, where he attends junior high school and the first two years of high school.\n\n1905\n\nIn the summer Capek is expelled from the high school for taking part in an illegal students club.\n\nIn the fall Capek moves to Brno, where he lives close to his sister, Helena.\n\n1907\n\nHe stays in Brno for two years and moves to Prague along with his parents, where he starts the final two years of high school at the prestigious Academic High School in the fall.\n\n1909\n\nCapek graduates with all A's in June.\n\n1909\n\nIn September Karel Capek and his brother, Josef, go to Munich, where they stay for a month.\n\nIn October, Karel Capek signs up at the Charles University of Prague for courses on philosophy.\n\n1910\n\nCapek goes to the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin.\n\n1911\n\nThe first half of his third year of his University studies takes place at the Charles University, the other one at the Sorbonne of Paris.\n\nAfter the end of the semester there, Capek travels a bit around France and returns to Prague, where he continues studies for three more years.\n\n1915\n\nOn Nov. 29 Capek graduates as master of philosophy.\n\nThe same year, Capek isn't enlisted to fight in World War I because of back problems, which followed him throughout his life.\n\nEarly works\n\n1917\n\nCapek becomes a member of the board of editors of the Narod (Nation) magazine.\n\nAlong with his brother, he becomes an editor of the cultural section with the Narodni listy (the National paper).\n\nBoth brothers work at the satirical weekly Nebojsa (the Unafraid).\n\nCapek along with his brother and some other editors resign in protest of the paper's politics.\n\nCapek publishes his first important work, a play called R.U.R., which stands for Rossum's Universal Robots.
