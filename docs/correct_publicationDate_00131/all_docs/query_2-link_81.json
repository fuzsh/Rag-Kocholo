This volume includes a selection of Capek’s best plays (including R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), stories, columns, and essays, all newly translated or modernized and corrected. In his uniquely humorous meditations on mortality and commitment, on people’s failures to understand, Capek searched for the root, or the radical center, of our contradictions and mysteries."
