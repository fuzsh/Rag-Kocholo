        "text": "24 books in, CJ Box’s Joe Pickett series is – on the strength of Three-Inch Teeth – still going very strong indeed. We’d go as far to say that this might even be one of his best.\n\nThings kick off with a young man called Clay, fly fishing in a river and day-dreaming about his plans to propose to a certain Sheridan Pickett a little later that day, when he is rudely disturbed by a huge grizzly bear who – you know, sort of tears him to pieces. A little later in the day, Joe descends on the crime scene in the company of the Predator Attack team and – well, let’s say the bear hasn’t quite quit the scene yet.\n\nMeanwhile, a few hundred miles away, one Dallas Cates – who regular Box readers will recall from both Endangered and Vicious Circle – is getting out of prison and you probably won’t be surprised to learn he hasn’t uncovered a new benevolent streak during his downtime. He has a list of names and he won’t rest until those names are forever etched out. When he sees stories of bear attacks all over the news, his cogs start turning and he thinks hmmm, maybe I can turn this to my advantage and dispatch a few people I happen to dislike a bit in the style of a bear attack.\n\nAt which point, Cates hitches his wagon to another long-time Joe Pickett big bad in the form of Alex Soledad (who those aforementioned regular readers might remember from both Dark Sky and Shadows Reel). Soledad has been writing to Cates in prison, boring him with all of his talk of overthrowing established elites (“blah blah blah,” thinks Cates), but at the same time enticing him with the idea of their overlapping Venn diagrams (both of them hating pretty much the same small group of people).\n\nAnd so we have Joe and his Predator team on the trail of a grizzly bear behaving weirdly, and Cates and Soledad (and others) on the trail of their enemies with a contraption that replicates a bear attack and – well, we all know all those roads to Rome will converge at some point. But Box, as we know, is not a writer who likes to rely on even just a twin track of narrative when he can throw more in there to muddy the waters and keep you turning the pages trying to work out how all of these things fit together.\n\nElsewhere in the book, we have Sheridan (not grieving as much as she feels she ought for poor Clay) undertaking her first real job for Yarak Inc (Nate Romanowski’s bird business) which sees her crossing swords with someone from her dad’s past. There is also a pair of activists looking to protect the killer bear from all these Governmental do-gooders, who snarl up proceedings a bit too. But the real hook of Three-Inch Teeth is that Box, like Mick Herron in his enthralling Slough House series, is not afraid to do away with characters who have been in the books a few years now – and there are at least a couple of such moments across these 360 odd pages.\n\nAs ever, we hoovered this book up in a day. By the end, you’ll see that this functions in the same way as Dark Sky did – setting up the action for the next book. If CJ Box could either hurry along with that or, you know, send us chapters as he finishes them (or just pages, at the end of each day) that would be absolutely fine with us."
