The truth is, while this Hollywood-ized view of data security highlights the challenges in protecting data from hackers, it doesn't speak the full truth. The real truth is that it’s a combination of all the ‘little things’ we do each day that are truly putting data at risk, exposing it outright, losing it or opening those doors for hackers."
