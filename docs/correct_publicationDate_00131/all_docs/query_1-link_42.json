        "text": "A bright future expects Prym and Joanna in Erit, a nation built on the ruins of a ravaged Poland. But their lives are upended the day they are chosen to be sent to the Zone where the ‘Thing’ lurks. They have just one task: to defeat the most dangerous creature ever created by humans. Nineteen generations have passed through the gates of the Zone. No-one has ever returned.\n\nYet Prym and Joanna see their mission as a great honour, a sentiment not shared by Edward, whose linguistic skills will be of little use on the other side of the Wall. Their tumultuous arrival in the Zone proves him right. They discover a lawless place where survivors have formed clans which wage a ruthless war for territory. They also learn that some people here develop mutations that often result in death, and sometimes grant them a gift as strange as it is powerful.\n\nAs Joanna begins to mutate and Edward struggles to survive, Prym discovers a strange link with the Thing that may allow them to deactivate it and to reopen the walls of the Zone.\n\nThey may, after all, have a future."
