        "text": "Killing Floor\n\nBy Lee Child,\n\nFrom my list on unconventional, stubborn, loyal characters with explorer’s hearts.\n\nBy Tina O’Hailey Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI chose my favorite books, and through careful psyche analysis, I see a theme in them: stubborn characters who persevere through miserable elements. I cave, hike, kayak, motorcycle, etc. A lot of it is not comfortable. It starts with having an explorer’s heart. It isn’t glamorous. It is 90% talking yourself into the fact that you can do something you at first don’t believe you can do. The similar-minded friends that one finds along the way are lifelong, and there’s a bond that forms from crazy people like this. That comes through in my writing – companionship against a backdrop of stubborn exploration in an indifferent environment.\n\nTina's book list on unconventional, stubborn, loyal characters with explorer’s hearts\n\nWhy did Tina love this book?\n\nReacher is dedicated to his “family” 5000%. Nothing else matters. Nothing. He is an incredibly simple and driven character who cannot resonate with the world around him nor give a moment to care that he does not. He is. That is all. Family is his team and, in this case, one actual family member. All are on equal footing.\n\nWhile most details from books fade from my memory, this book (read when it first came out and eons before the TV show) is etched into my memory completely. The characters, the places, the fights, the sights and smells. I fell for Reacher’s plight and his steadfast mission to prove his innocence. My favorite image is hobo Reacher sleeping wherever and thinking nothing strange in that.\n\nBy Lee Child,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n12 authors picked Killing Floor as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nEx-military policeman Jack Reacher is a drifter. He's just passing through Margrave, Georgia, and in less than an hour, he's arrested for murder. Not much of a welcome. All Reacher knows is that he didn't kill anybody. At least not here. Not lately. But he doesn't stand a chance of convincing anyone. Not in Margrave, Georgia. Not a chance in hell.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Black Echo\n\nBy Michael Connelly,\n\nFrom my list on strong men and women attempting survival in a less moral environment.\n\nBy John Klawitter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was a wild card in the industry heavy town where I was born and raised, destined to burn out my days early in a factory or steel mill. But I worked my way through college, survived several close calls in Vietnam and bull headed my way into a series of jobs that pushed me toward Hollywood assignments as a writer, producer and director.\n\nJohn's book list on strong men and women attempting survival in a less moral environment\n\nWhy did John love this book?\n\nI liked this novel because I was in Vietnam, have friends forever changed by contact with the mad god Mars, and could easily relate to the main character.\n\nAfter his time in the military, Vietnam war tunnel rat Harry Bosch has to fight his own PTSD as well as very real present dangers in his job with the Los Angeles police force. Since I have studied the L.A. police for some of my novels, Connelly’s writing rings very true to me.\n\nBy Michael Connelly,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n13 authors picked The Black Echo as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn LAPD homicide detective must choose between justice and vengeance as he teams up with the FBI in this \"thrilling\" novel filled with mystery and adventure (New York Times Book Review).\n\n​\n\nFor maverick LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch, the body in the drainpipe at Mulholland Dam is more than another anonymous statistic. This one is personal . . . because the murdered man was a fellow Vietnam \"tunnel rat\" who had fought side by side with him in a hellish underground war. Now Bosch is about to relive the horror of Nam. From a dangerous maze of blind alleys…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Big Sleep\n\nBy Raymond Chandler,\n\nFrom my list on hardboiled crime novels that will move you to tears.\n\nBy Charles Ardai Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI created Hard Case Crime 20 years ago to revive the look, feel, and storytelling style of the great paperback crime novels of the 1940s and 50s: slender, high-velocity tales with irresistible premises, crackling dialogue, and powerful emotions, all presented behind gorgeous painted covers in the classic pulp style. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to publish Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Ray Bradbury, James M. Cain, Erle Stanley Gardner, Mickey Spillane, Brian De Palma, Ed McBain, and many more extraordinary authors.\n\nCharles' book list on hardboiled crime novels that will move you to tears\n\nWhy did Charles love this book?\n\nThe first novel about legendary private eye Phillip Marlowe is also the first mystery novel that ever made me cry when I turned the last page.\n\nMarlowe’s poetic narration and bruised outsider’s voice offer a cynical but also strangely hopeful perspective on both the shady underworld types and the corrupt high-society folk who fill the “mean streets” down which Marlowe must walk (in Chandler’s much-quoted phrase).\n\nWhy hopeful when death–the big sleep–awaits us all? Because a man of principles like Marlowe can still bring a measure of justice in this unjust world, sometimes just by bearing witness.\n\nBy Raymond Chandler,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n18 authors picked The Big Sleep as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nRaymond Chandler's first three novels, published here in one volume, established his reputation as an unsurpassed master of hard-boiled detective fiction.\n\nThe Big Sleep, Chandler's first novel, introduces Philip Marlowe, a private detective inhabiting the seamy side of Los Angeles in the 1930s, as he takes on a case involving a paralysed California millionaire, two psychotic daughters, blackmail and murder.\n\nIn Farewell, My Lovely, Marlowe deals with the gambling circuit, a murder he stumbles upon, and three very beautiful but potentially deadly women.\n\nIn The High Window, Marlowe searches the California underworld for a priceless gold coin and finds himself…\n\nPreview\n\nIn the Crosshairs: The Body on Leffis Key\n\nBy M.

And while I always saw True Crime as a busman’s holiday, I loved crime fiction all along. Eventually my own writing took me there, as well. I love how crime fiction, much like good science fiction, explores the nature of human behavior in a way that isn’t as prevalent in other genres. As a result, I’ve read widely in the field, always gravitating toward the darker and grittier entries. The lone wolf protagonists who either live by a code or undergo a fascinating change within the book or series has also been my focus.\n\nFrank's book list on action with thrills that could really happen\n\nWhy did Frank love this book?\n\nThanks to Hollywood adaptations and sometimes a greedy publisher, a great series can diminish as time passes. But that doesn’t change how cool the original was.\n\nI love the setup of a man waking on a sailing vessel with no memory, only to discover his identity as super espionage agent. The mystery of the scenario and the intrigue as Bourne unravels his own personhood was so well done in this first book (and the first film was an excellent adaptation), and it is worth revisiting.\n\nBy Robert Ludlum,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n13 authors picked The Bourne Identity as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJason Bourne is back in the forthcoming major motion picture starring Matt Damon and Alicia Vikander. Go back to where it all began for Bourne in his first adventure - The Bourne Identity\n\nHe was dragged from the sea, his body riddled with bullets. There are a few clues: a frame of microfilm surgically implanted beneath the skin of his hip; evidence that plastic surgery has altered his face; strange things he says in his delirium, which could be code words. And a number on the film negative that leads to a bank account in Zurich, four million dollars, and…\n\nPreview\n\nA Time to Kill\n\nBy John Grisham,\n\nFrom my list on legal thrillers with law and justice tension.\n\nBy Terry Lewis Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up watching Perry Mason on TV and have always enjoyed mysteries with a legal theme, what has become known as the legal thriller. My affection for this genre only increased when I became a lawyer and, later, a trial judge. I especially appreciate a novel that accurately depicts what lawyers and judges say and do and that highlights the tension between law and justice. Not surprisingly, that has been my goal for the four legal thrillers I have written.\n\nTerry's book list on legal thrillers with law and justice tension\n\nWhy did Terry love this book?\n\nGrisham is the undisputed king of the legal thriller. Of all his novels, my favorite is his first. The story is set in a small southern town and centers on a white lawyer defending a black man (a la To Kill a Mockingbird). However, the lawyer, Jake, is not as noble as Atticus, as he is more motivated by personal ambition. And unlike Atticus’ client, his client is clearly guilty of murder, though the circumstances (the accused killed the men who brutally raped his young daughter) make him sympathetic.\n\nThere is an abundance of stereotypes here, including the Jewish lawyer sent by the NAACP, the angry Ku Klux Klan members, and the Ivy League law student who comes to help, but Grisham somehow makes it work. In the end, the reader, just like the jury, must choose between the law and their sense of justice.\n\nBy John Grisham,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n9 authors picked A Time to Kill as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n______________________________\n\nTHE MULTI-MILLION COPY BESTSELLER\n\nJohn Grisham's first and most shocking novel, adapted as a film starring Samuel L. Jackson and Matthew McConaughey\n\nWhen Carl Lee Hailey guns down the violent racists who raped his ten-year-old daughter, the people of the small town of Clanton, Mississippi see it as justice done, and call for his acquittal.\n\nBut when extremists outside Clanton - including the KKK - hear that a black man has killed two white men, they invade the town, determined to destroy anything and anyone that opposes their sense of justice. A national media circus descends on Clanton.\n\nAs…\n\nPreview\n\nA Drink Before the War\n\nBy Dennis Lehane,\n\nFrom my list on crime characters who transcend the printed word.\n\nBy David Hutchison Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up in Edinburgh and, from an early age, I heard the tale of Deacon Brodie. However, it was not until I was older—when a city official was charged with corruption—that I realised Brodie might just be the first ‘white collar’ criminal in Edinburgh. The more I found out, the more fascinating he became. Here was a man who everyone in the city saw as a wealthy, respectable, Councillor, yet—at the same time—he was a gambler who became a criminal to feed his habit, and so, when I moved to America, I decided to write my first crime novel based on Brodie’s life.\n\nDavid's book list on crime characters who transcend the printed word\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nLehane, one of my favourite authors, introduces the crime writer’s device of the duo, in his first Kenzie and Gennaro novel. For me, as in my own DCI Steel novels, the duo in writing can work to inform, or mislead, the reader and, if handled well, the reader doesn’t notice, seeing the interaction between characters as normal. Clichés abound in crime fiction, especially in lead characters, but Lehane avoids this with P.I. Patrick Kenzie, and his lifelong friend, Angie Gennaro. Given the area they inhabit, with its racial and gang tensions, added to the clients they have, clichés would seem unavoidable, but—once again—the lesson here is to write multi-faceted characters, which Kenzie and Gennaro emphatically are. They are flawed, but in Lehane’s hands, triumphantly human, and very believable.\n\nBy Dennis Lehane,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked A Drink Before the War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPatrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are tough private investigators who know the blue-collar neighbourhoods and ghettos of Boston's Dorchester section as only natives can. Working out of an old church belfry, Kenzie and Gennaro take on a seemingly simple assignment for a prominent politician: to uncover the whereabouts of Jenna Angeline, a black cleaning woman who has allegedly stolen confidential Statehouse documents.\n\nBut finding Jenna proves easy compared to staying alive. The investigation escalates, uncovering a web of corruption extending from bombed-out ghetto streets to the highest levels of state government.\n\nWith slick, hip dialogue and a lyrical narrative pocked…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Ninja\n\nBy Eric Van Lustbader,\n\nFrom my list on thrillers break the mold with characters and story.\n\nBy Richard Doetsch Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an adrenaline junky—years of kitesurfing, skydiving, bungee jumping, Zero Gravity training—I have a passion for thrills and adventure, coupled with the love for my soulmate, Virginia, since we were kids, I live what I write and write what I live. Of course, I filter it all through my vivid imagination to raise the stakes and pull you in. When I look for a great book, it’s tough to get my blood flowing, to get me excited, but these books are the nearest thing to the thrill of freefalling and having your first chute fail to open (been there, done that. Thank, God for the reserve chute!). These books are truly unique, putting you on the edge of your seat and leaving you wanting more.\n\nRichard's book list on thrillers break the mold with characters and story\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nThis was the first book I read twice. It was groundbreaking back in the ’80s. A mixture of cultures, assassins, adventure, thrills, love, sex, and passion. A huge bestseller at the time. His detail of Japanese philosophy, fighting styles, honor, and code in a modern-day world is beyond captivating.\n\nWhile he went on to a huge success with dozens of bestsellers, nothing topped this. It was a lifetime of daydreaming and research that he poured out onto the page.\n\nI read it in two days on the beach under the sun and stars. Five days later, I read it again. I couldn’t get the story out of my head.\n\nBy Eric Van Lustbader,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Ninja as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this New York Times–bestselling thriller, a martial artist’s past returns to haunt him—in the form of a murderous ninja.\n\nRaised in Japan by a British father and a Chinese mother, young Nicholas Linnear felt at home only in the dojo, where he gave himself over to mastering ninjutsu—the ancient art of the ninja. Over years of training, he ascended to the highest ranks imaginable—until a confrontation over the very meaning of ninjutsu changed his approach to martial arts forever, sending him on a journey that would take him across the globe.\n\nNow, after years of success in the advertising…\n\nPreview\n\nThe List of Seven\n\nBy Mark Frost,\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nA true original. Arthur Conan Doyle working -to solve a series of grisly murders. Released in 1993, it sucked me in with the first paragraph.\n\nIt mixes genres and the historical with the fictional. There are Sherlock Holmes easter eggs everywhere, the idea being this thriller informed his writing. The characters, both good and evil, flesh out the great detective in a thriller-paced adventure.\n\nYou may not have heard of the author, but you definitely heard of one of his TV shows: Twin Peaks, which he created and wrote with David Lynch. While the TV show’s known for its quirkiness, it has a fantastic underlying mystery that drove the story. Much like Frost drives the story in The List of Seven.\n\nBy Mark Frost,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The List of Seven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nChristmas day, 1884 - a letter is slid under the door of a struggling young doctor and aspiring novelist, begging him to come to the aid of a mysterious woman, a victim of the black spiritual arts. From the foggy streets of London to the windswept moors of Yorkshire, a demonic conspiracy unfolds.\n\nPreview\n\nMagic\n\nBy William Goldman,\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nThe best for last!\n\nYou may not recognize the name William Goldman but I guarantee loved at least one of his stories. An amazing storyteller, novelist, and screenwriter: Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, Marathon Man, Misery (he adapted Steve King), Chaplin, The Ghost, and The Darkness, and… The Princess Bride. He’s a man who moves between genres with ease and expertise.\n\nHis book Magic tops them all. A depressed magician/ventriloquist heads to a lake house vacation. Murder, mystery, and thrills ensue all told in a shocking style that is truly original. I can’t say more without spoiling it. It’s a short novel, a fast read and it will leave an impression on you for weeks to come. After your mind is blown by Magic, look him up, you’ll be impressed!\n\nBy William Goldman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Magic as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“One of those can’t-put-it-down-until-the-last-page-is-turned monsters that has readers all over the country missing sleep.”—Minneapolis Tribune\n\nCorky is a brilliant entertainer with a bright future ahead of him. He has good looks, many women, and enormous talent. He also had a secret and a certainty: a secret that must be hidden from his public at all costs; and a certainty that the dark forces of magic were out to destroy him.\n\n“Fascinating . . . This dazzling psychological thriller cannot be put down! . . . The most imaginative and enjoyable novel I've read since Marathon Man. . . . [A]…\n\nPreview\n\nTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\n\nBy John le Carré,\n\nWhy did Eric love this book?\n\nI love the sense of intimacy in this book.\n\nThe characters are flawed and detailed against the backdrop of London and Great Britain. It is a classic of the genre and really takes you back to the pre-internet and pre-fall of the USSR. It really captures what it was like to live in those times.\n\nBy John le Carré,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of A Legacy of Spies.\n\nThe man he knew as \"Control\" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus.
