        "text": "My immigrant mother tells this story of the day she became a naturalized citizen. How a single piece of paper became her ticket to belong in this country and create her own American Dream. An opportunity she never had and one she would not squander. It's a powerful story to hear her tell it. As I look into the eyes of these graduates at commencement, I see... happiness, confidence, tears, empowerment, exhaustion, etc. All emotions I imagine my mother felt that day. And the little part I get to play in spreading that type of feeling far and wide, brings me immense pride and joy. Congrats to the graduates! #gogrizzlies #adamsstateuniversity\n\nSo, my team and I at #WBK are hiring. If you know a dynamic, hungry, smart, gritty and generally awesome human that you think can keep up with Michael Nelson and I, please don't be shy-- we want to hear from you. #notjustanotherlawfirm #StratComms #growing https://lnkd.in/gcjqwsVa\n\nWow! My head is spinning a bit. US Department of Commerce, NTIA just annouced $930M in middle mile grants... and #WBK is amazingly proud to work with such incredible clients that two of them won 4 awards!! Congrats to our friends at #Zayo and #KOBD #StateofKansas for their awards. Middle mile is a critical piece to solving the digital divide and this is a massive step in the right direction. Congrats to all awardees!!! And so it begins... Jade Piros de Carvalho Joseph Le Joel Daly Andrés Irlando David Toland Michael Nelson Stuart Taubman\n\nThe main reason I was able to overcome my life-long aversion to law firms is because WBK gave me the opportunity to work with the best in the telecommunications, broadband funding, and energy fields. Here's another proof point of that very concept. #notjustanotherlawfirm #wbk\n\nAfter an exhaustive, national, and open search that involved many diverse voices from within the San Luis Valley region, the Adams State University Board of Trustees unanimously voted to drop the interim and name David Tandberg the 12th President of ASU. Congrats to David and thanks to his family for sharing this incredible leader with this community. Now, it is time to get back to the real work! Go Grizzlies! Adams State University Bruce Rosengrant\n\nHard to put into words what this means to me. The small part I was able to play in this effort to bring this level of service to a community where I was born and raised gives me immense joy. Jeff Dolan Nicolas Jimenez Gary Amella"
