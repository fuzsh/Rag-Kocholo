        "text": "LIHUE, Hawaii – Members of the 33rd Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team tested interoperability during a weapons of mass destruction exercise with the Kaua’i Emergency Management Agency, the Hawaii National Guard, and a half dozen other integrated CST teams and CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Packages.\n\n“These types of training events allow CST members to better prepare for rapid deployment of personnel and equipment in support of a national event across all 54 states and territories,” said U.S. Army Maj. Keith Hapenney, commander, 33rd WMD-CST, District of Columbia National Guard.\n\n“Coordinating exercise activities of this magnitude stress logistical management of personnel, equipment and on-ground support,” he said.\n\nThe Hawaii National Guard’s full-scale weapons of mass destruction exercise spanned four counties in June. National Guardsmen identified hazards, assessed current and projected consequences, advised on response measures, and assisted with appropriate requests for additional support.\n\n“CST personnel must plan for an all-hazards approach to the three pillars of support: site reconnaissance, site characterization and sampling while coordinating non-standard means of moving the support package required to integrate into ongoing operations,” Hapenney said.\n\nAn exercise of this magnitude proves useful for dealing with hazardous materials incidents and events that require coordination between multiple agencies and disciplines and interoperable communications. It also positions military and civilian response partners to learn different processes and how different agencies interact to better integrate capabilities when disaster strikes."
