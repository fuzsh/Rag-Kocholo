(Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts) - Wiffin, Rob\n\nA slow, bluesy solo for trombone with band accompanimentLike many people, I took the opportunity offered by the COVID lockdown in Spring of 2020 to sort through old paperwork. I discovered a lot of songs that had not seen the light of day for many years and were mostly written with just the melody and chord symbols. Some offered the potential of becoming instrumental solos with a combination of heart-on-the-sleeve melodies the like of which I would not write now, together with maybe a greater sophistication in the instrumental writing. I had the notion in the back of my mind that Do you recall?; would work as a trombone solo but it seemed to fight me all the way. However, once finished it has proved to appeal to trombonists and has already been recorded by Brett Baker. It is not intrinsically difficult but needs a sense of the appropriate slow swing style and good control throughout the range.- Rob WiffinDuration: 4.15\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nView Music\n\nShout! (Trombone Solo with Brass Band - Score and Parts) - Wiffin, Rob\n\nShout! was written for Brett Baker to demonstrate a particular musical aspect of his trombone playing.It is a Latin jazz piece subtitled CCC 4 BB - Cha cha cha for Brett Baker - and shows the trombone's ability to act as a declamatory jazz voice, covering much of the range and expressive power of the instrument. In one sense the title also refers to the jazz tradition of a Shout chorus which often appears towards the end of a jazz piece, bringing the players together after they have all taken their improvised solos.Shout! should hopefully be enjoyable to listen to and, although not without its technical challenges, fun to play.Duration: 3.45Recorded on Polyphonic QPRL227D SHOUT!\n\nEstimated dispatch 7-14 working days\n\nView Music"
