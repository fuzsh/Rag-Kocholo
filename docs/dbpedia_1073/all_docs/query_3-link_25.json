Tony had been told that he would need a real breakthrough recording or he might be dropped from his contract with Columbia. He was preparing for a recording session with Percy Faith. They had three songs planned, but need a fourth. Percy grabbed the sheet music for “Because of You” from the pile on his piano. And, well, the rest was history. After a slow start, “Because of You” was Bennett’s first song to hit #1 on the charts, thanks in large part to fans playing it on jukeboxes and calling radio stations to play that new song from Tony Bennett. It spent 10 weeks at the top of the charts and charted for 32 weeks and sold over a million copies.\n\nToday, I’ve chosen his recording of this song with k. d. lang on the 2006 album Duets: An American Classic.
