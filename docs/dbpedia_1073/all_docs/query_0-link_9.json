        "text": "HERE COME THE CLASSICS VOL. 8 – LIGHT MUSIC LEGENDS. MALCOLM ARNOLD English Dances : Set 2 Op. 33, No.1); ERIC COATES By the Sleepy Lagoon, Calling all Workers, Dambusters March; ARTHUR WOOD Barwick Green; VIVIAN ELLIS Coronation Scot; HAYDN WOOD The Bandstand, Hyde Park (Frescoes Suite); HUBERT BATH Cornish Rhapsody; ROBERT FARNON Westminster Waltz, Portrait of a Flirt; TREVOR DUNCAN March (Little Suite); CHARLES WILLIAMS Rhythm on Rails, Devils Galop, Heart o’ London; ARTHUR BENJAMIN Jamaican Rumba , EDWARD WHITE Puffin’ Billy; ANTHONY COLLINS Vanity Fair; EDWARD ELGAR Chanson de Nuit. Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Barry Wordsworth with Roderick Elms (piano). RPO 008CD, total timing 59:28 mins. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra are in the midst of producing ‘in house’ a series of CD’s under the generic title of ‘Here comes the Classics’ and Volume eight which has just appeared focuses on ‘Light Music Legends’. Many of the pieces included here will be perhaps overly familiar to the seasoned collector who will almost certainly have already various other alternative modern recordings in his collection, but the present disc is nonetheless worth considering on several counts. The novelty here is Charles Williams’ Heart o’ Londonconsisting of a medley of popular tunes ranging from Cherry Ripe to Noel Coward’s London Pride.Also included here and having a comparatively rare outing is Haydn Wood’s ‘The Bandstand, Hyde Park’ from ‘Frescoes’ – a splendid piece and played here with a marvellous sense of style and panache. This disc has the added advantage of featuring one of London’s premier symphony orchestras, a conductor with an innate sense of how this music should be played and an excellent recording made in the Henry Wood Hall, London. So no matter how many versions of The Dambusters March you have already lurking on your shelves, this CD is more than worth seeking out! Available from : Recordings Dept.

The first three CDs were released in April, with two more at the end of May. For full tracklistings please refer to pages 20, 21 & 22 of JIM 158 [March 2004] and pages 26 & 27 in this issue.\n\nGLCD5101 An Introduction\n\nGLCD5102 The 1940s\n\nGLCD5103 The 1950s\n\nGLCD5104 Great British Light Orchestras\n\nGLCD5105 Great American Light Orchestras\n\nA comprehensive description of this important new series, plus full tracklistings, appeared in JIM 158, to which readers are referred. This has obviously been a major undertaking, and it is evident that a great deal of care has been taken, both in the choice of programmes, and the quality of the sound restoration. Inevitably there are a fair number of tracks which have already appeared on other recent CD reissue compilations, but these are balanced by the inclusion of either [a] different versions of familiar pieces, or [b] compositions which have made it on to CD for the first time. There is a good mix of commercial and publishers’ recordings, and the great attraction lies in the actual sequencing of the items; play any of these CDs and you will immediately be transported back to the ‘good old days’ of the BBC Light Programme. Whilst writing this I am listening to Volume 2 (being reproduced through a superb 1950s restored Grundig table radio) and it is difficult to believe that it is really 2004 – it is as if David Ades and Alan Bunting have indeed created the proverbial time machine! We are promised more to come, but in the meantime these three new CDs cannot be too highly recommended. Tony Clayden Guild Light Music CDs can be purchased from the RFS Record Service for £7 each [US $14]; the first three are offered at a special price of £18 [$36] for all three (plus postage and packing), if ordered before 30 June 2004.\n\nPERCY FAITH AND HIS ORCHESTRA ‘Delicado’ 2-CD collection of early recordings for full tracklisting please refer to page 11 of JIM 158 [March 2004]. Sanctuary Group Living Era CD AJS 278. A word of warning to the reader: this is a biased review. Percy Faith is my favourite composer/ arranger/ conductor, and Alan Bunting is a personal friend, so any time Alan turns his attention to Faith the results are likely to be pleasing. In the present instance, they are spectacular. Alan has filled a great void by collecting the scattered early commercial recordings of Percy Faith, from roughly 1944 to the early 1950s, from four different record companies, and most are appearing on CD for the first time -- an event that ten years ago would have seemed impossible. If you are a dedicated fan, you have possibly managed to round up many of these selections on ancient, hissy vinyl (or perhaps even 78) but you have never heard them like this. With the touch of the magic Bunting wand, these 60 year old recordings glow with a warmth and detail never before heard. Faith did not make concessions to the limitations of the recording technology of the period, and frankly in the past I have never been able to even hear much of what was really going on in these arrangements. It is a revelation to hear the 1944 Decca recordings in particular. A fan of Faith's Latin American arrangements has to love these; although a couple (Bim, Bam, Boom! and Tico-Tico) were later heard on stereo albums, most are unique. (Negra Consentida remains one of my favourite arrangements.) The cello solo in If There Is Someone Lovlier Than You is by itself worth the price of the entire set. In some respects, the older versions seem superior to the later stereo recordings; for all the technical limitations, I think I prefer the 1940s version of Tia Juana to the 1960s recording. But this is far from a collection which would be of interest only to hardcore fans; it also contains some gems that were only out as singles at the time, and have been neglected because they are out of the mainstream. Most notably, there are two selections with then-famous cabaret singer Hildegarde (no surname needed, evidently). Not only does Hildegarde have one of those \"warm, down-around-the-ankles\" voices (in Raymond Chandler's phrase) – it’s easy to see why she was so popular - the arrangements are a complete delight, as Faith sends the orchestra nipping and tucking at her heels like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. Another surprise is a vocal version of the Alec Wilder melodyGoodbye, John, which Faith memorably recorded with Mitch Miller on the oboe; undoubtedly the right choice, since the lyrics are pedestrian, but who knew there were any? The second CD ends with a rather playful trick. Faith recorded an extended instrumental variant of the Song From 'Moulin Rouge' for the album \"Music From Hollywood\", and Alan has combined this with the familiar, frequently-anthologized Felicia Sanders vocal version which will no doubt become the standard we all will listen to from now on! The only negative thing you should know is this: if you buy this collection, you may have a hard time getting it out of your CD player. It's that good. If only there could be more... but we're lucky to have what we do. Congratulations to all of the people involved in making it possible. John Cutcher\n\nComplementary to the five new Collectables issues is ‘Delicado’, Percy Faith’s double album on the Living Era label [CD AJS 278]. Here we have all of his earliest commercial recordings, made for the Majestic, Decca and RCA Victor labels, plus a selection of those he made after joining Columbia – a total of 50 original mono recordings spanning the years 1944 to 1953. Alan Bunting has done all the compilation, transfers, audio restoration and re-mastering, and the booklet notes, and it was obviously a labour of love. This is my kind of Percy Faith and these 2 CDs have given me more pleasure than many of the other re-issued examples of his work from the later years of his wonderful career. Peter Burt\n\nThis 2-CD set is available from the RFS Record Service for £11 [US $22] plus postage and packing.\n\nJOHN PHILIP SOUSA : MUSIC FOR WIND BAND – Vol. 4 Marches: Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, Sesqui-Centennial Exposition, Riders for the Flag, Ancient and Honorable Artillery Co., Pathfinder of Panama, The Glory of the Yankee Navy, The Aviators, The Stars and Stripes Forever, Selection Bride Elect, Suite: Tales of a Traveller, Waltz: Co-eds of Michigan. Band of the Royal Artillery conducted by Keith Brion. Naxos 8.559093 59mins. Volume 4 in the Naxos American Classics series of the complete Wind Band music of John Philip Sousa which incidentally includes a staggering 136 marches (!) fully upholds the superb production values of this series with regard to both performance and recording, aided no doubt by the splendidly spacious acoustic of Woolwich Town Hall. Indeed under the experienced and highly skilled tutelage of Mike Parton of the Specialist Recording Company, this disc is a model of how good a military band recording should sound – the results are deeply impressive. Much of the contents of this latest instalment consists mainly of notable rarities although decidedly not of course ‘The Stars and Stripes Forever’ – probably the most famous military march ever written, which here receives a suitably resplendent performance to bring this CD to an excellent conclusion. One of the joys of Sousa marches is their sometimes gloriously over the top titles and included here we have ‘Nobles of the Mystic Shrine’ and ‘‘The Glory of the Yankee Navy’- it’s difficult not to raise a wry smile at such appellations! The Ancient and Honorable Artillery Co. of Boston is apparently the oldest military organisation in the USA and the resultant march composed at their request includes their marching song ‘Auld Lange Syne’. ‘The Aviators’ a late piece composed a year before Sousa’s death in 1931 is dedicated to William J. Moffett who Keith Brion tells us in his informative notes is considered to be the father of the aircraft carrier. During the performance of this piece, you are well advised to duck down since it comes complete with low flying aircraft. The most substantial work in this collection is the 1911 Suite, ‘Tales of a Traveller’which will certainly be of some interest to those of us on this side of the pond, since the final movement is an imposing and fairly lengthy coronation march apparently intended to be used at the coronation of King George V. Its subsequent non-appearance within the hallowed walls of Westminster Abbey may have been due to the fact that the rather staid British Establishment considered it lacked a degree of dignity and gravitas appropriate for such a solemn ceremony. If you haven’t been tempted to invest in this outstanding series, I can only suggest in suitable military parlance that you now get ‘fell in at the double’ behind the Royal Artillery Band – surely one of the brightest jewels in the crown of British Army music - for an exhilarating , often exciting and hugely enjoyable musical adventure! A brilliant disc and superb value! Already issued in this Naxos series are : Vol.1 8.559058, Vol.2 8.559059, Vol.3 8.559092 (reviewed in JIM No.155 06/03).

The Aspidistra Drawing Room Orchestra (comprising 7 to 8 players: flute, oboe, piano and strings) are helping to keep alive the \"light music salon orchestra\" tradition by concerts and CD’s. These latter, recorded in 1998 and 2003 respectively, each contain an enjoyably varied selection of light orchestral repertoire. The later one includes popular numbers like the Ketelby and Fletcher pieces, perhaps also Aletter’sRendezvous (a trifle heavy in touch here for my taste), the Myddleton ‘sketch’ and Joe Rixners livelyRagamuffin polka. But less well known are the foottapping Billy Possum’s Frolic, (an \"irresistible twostep\" !), Ancliffe’s delicious Valley of Poppies and Grunfeld’s shapely Romance, Roy Bell who arranges the Rigoletto Quartet, is the orchestra flautist. The earlier disc features three more Ancliffe’s including the popular Nights of Gladness, ebuilliently done.; also of much charm are the items by Jan Hurst (who once conducted so many resort orchestras either side of 1939-45) Montague Ewing and from the continent Fahrbach and Paul Linke. Playing time is scarcely generous but all lovers of this repertoire should be delighted with the varied programmes and stylish execution. Philip L. Scowcroft\n\nSOUSA MARCHES Band of HM Royal Marines [Royal Marines School of Music] conducted by Lt Col G A C Hoskins, MVO, ARAM, RM EMI 5855352 [65’07\" & 64’49\" mins] Having only bought this budget-priced 2-CD set because I’d heard the conductor give a talk about serving on the Royal yacht ‘Britannia’, and just expecting to dip in and out of it, I found myself playing each CD at a sitting and my attention was retained throughout. There are a total of 43 tracks [too numerous to list here] but even this is less than a third of the March King’s output. His big popular successes are here, likeThe Gladiator, Semper fidelis, The Washington Post, The Liberty Bell, The Stars and Stripes Forever and Hands Across the Sea. In addition there are exotically entitled works such as Kansas Wildcats, Solid Men to the Front, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, The Gridiron Club, The Charlatan andLa Flor de Sevilla. I particularly enjoyed Jack Tar, premiered at London’s Albert Hall in 1903 in the presence of Royalty. The playing is of a high standard and the 20-year-old recording sounds fine. If you are not \"into\" military bands, let me encourage you to try this one – you may be pleasantly surprised.\n\nPeter Burt\n\nTHE MUSICAL WORLDS OF LAURIE JOHNSON Concerto for Trumpet, Tenor Saxophone and Orchestra The London Big Band and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Laurie Johnson Soloists: Guy Barker, Trumpet, Tommy Whittle, Tenor Saxophone; The Wind in the Willows (Tone Poem for Small Orchestra after Kenneth Grahame) London Studio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Jack Parnell; Irma La Goose Overture Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Laurie Johnson; Symphony (Synthesis) London Jazz Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Laurie Johnson, leader, Rodney Friend. Soloists, Stan Roderick, Kenny Wheeler, Trumpets, Don Lusher, Trombone, Joe Harriott, Alto Sax, Tony Coe, Tubby Hayes, Tenor Sax. AVID CD AVHN 102 72:26 mins. The title of this CD is slightly confusing, because it's the same as another album issued by the Polygram REDIAL label in 1998. Two of the above items were included in that issue: Laurie's spectacular jazz Symphony, recorded in 1970 , and The Wind in the Willows from 1971. But the Suite from the movie \"Hedda\" has been discarded to make way for two new compositions. Laurie presented his Concerto at a Royal Albert Hall Concert in 1999, and, until the issue of this CD, it has been available only on the Videotape of that concert (Golden Times GOL 11134). The version here is a new studio recording. Also appearing for the first time on CD is the delightful Irma La Goose Overture. Any new album by Laurie is a must for the collection, and this one includes useful sleeve notes by Laurie himself, plus some by the late Christopher Palmer reproduced from the original CD. Don't let the inadequate numbering of the tracks printed on the back cover prevent you from enjoying an exploration of these new musical worlds.Richard Hindley\n\nSEVEN A SUITE FOR ORCHESTRA by Tony Banks, LPO conducted by Mike Dixon, Naxos 8.557466. No, it’s not the British Labour MP but yes, it is the former member of Genesis pop group. No, it’s not pop music but yes, it is light classical, somewhere in between Vaughan Williams and Stanley Black! Eminently pleasurable and soothing this is something new to the repertoire. Based on four modern themes and three others he had mused over in previous decades, Banks asked Simon Hale to orchestrate them into a whole suite. The result is most satisfactory and with the London Philharmonic doing the honours Naxos can congratulate themselves. In order, the seven movements are Spring Tide, Black Down, The Gateway, The Ram, Earthlight, Neap Tide and The Spirit of Gravity. If you are looking for music which is easy on the ear you will not be disappointed. Edmund Whitehouse\n\nLOUIS LEVY The musical giant of Gaumont British films March of the Movies; Sing as we go; Who’s been polishing the sun?; Where there’s you there’s me; What a little moonlight can do; Without rhythm; This’ll make you whistle; Things are looking up; The eyes of the world are on you; Aunt Sally medley; Meet the sun halfway; Jingle of the jungle; Turning the world upside down; From one minute to another; Empire builders; Don’t you cry when we say goodbye; Cole Porter medley.Evergreen Melodies C92. At one time you were lucky to find the occasional Louis Levy track on a compilation CD, despite the fact that the late Alan Dell often featured him in his ‘Dance Band Days’ programme on BBC Radio-2. Then a few CDs started to appear, including the comprehensive set by Frank Bristow in Australia. More recently has been the Living Era CD, and now our friends at This England/Evergreen magazine have come up with an entertaining collection to accompany the article on Louis Levy in the Spring 2004 issue of Evergreen. All the tracks are listed above, so you can quickly see if there are any you need to complete your Levy collection. David Ades This CD is only available direct from Evergreen – telephone 01242 515156 – major credit cards accepted. A cassette version is also available.\n\nBoosey & Hawkes Volume 1 The New Concert Orchestra for full tracklisting please see page 16 of JIM 156 – September 2003 Vocalion CDLK 4192 74:34 mins. Seldom can such a mundane titled CD have yielded so much treasure. If it has passed you by, I urge you to get a copy. Apart from Monia Liter, also on Vocalion, you will not better spend a tenner all year. And, singularly, a Monia Liter composition, The Bullfighter, is for me the standout track. But the whole CD of background music specially recorded for film, radio and television crackles with \"joie de vivre\". Twelve of the 26 numbers are by Trevor Duncan, including his Four Old Fusspots and Little Suite: Folk Tune, the first time this has been given a commercial release. Our friend Ernest Tomlinson has contributedRomantic Journey and Exuberant Youth. The other composers represented are Vivian Ellis, Frederic Curzon, Cyril Watters and Sam Fonteyn. Many of the numbers will be new to quite a few of us and David Ades is to be congratulated on his selection. The recording quality is superb. If future volumes [and there will be if enough of us buy Volume 1] maintain this standard we are going to be delighted over and over again. Peter Burt\n\nERIC PARKIN The Piano Music of William Blezard Vol. 2 A Miscellany of Miniatures, Two Promenades for Eric Parkin, Tow Fantastic Dances, Three European Dances, etc… Shellwood SWCD27, 70:33 mins. In his later years, William Blezard (1921-2003) became known to the British public as the accompanist to Joyce Grenfell, and he was also associated in the same acapacity with Marlene Dietrich. Eric Parkin treats his music with the respect and charm that one would expect from a fellow pianist who is in a class of his own. It is nice to see that two tunes were specially composed by William for Eric, which adds a certain poignancy to this delightful collection. Apparently William approved the master of this CD the day before he died last year. David Ades\n\nDORIS DAY / ANDRE PREVIN: DUET. Close Your Eyes; Fools Rush In (Where Angels Fear To Tread); Yes; PLUS 3 Alternate Takes and 2 Bonus Tracks. (US Issue) Collectables COL-CD-6874. 55:37. Although this recording was mentioned in Richard Hindley’s great article in the last issue, Collectables has added 5 bonus tracks. This recording is a definite reminder of how great of a singer Doris Day was in music usually not associated with her name. Not only this, but we also get the rare opportunity to hear how hard Day and her accompanist Andre Previn worked on these songs. The released take (16 December, 1961) of \"Close Your Eyes\" sets the intimate nature of this album with a sexy, inviting quality in Doris Day’s interpretation. A perfect meeting of the minds. The alternate take of 30 November, 1961 shows both artists struggling with the music. Previn especially seems to be having very real problems with keeping things together as this take gradually disintegrates before our ears. The same isn’t true of \"Fools Rush In\" where the alternate take is actually far superior to the released version. The same goes for \"Nobody’s Heart\" where Doris Day sings with a heart breaking intensity. The other songs are sung with great warmth and excellent phrasing by Doris Day. There are three songs by Andre Previn and his then-wife Dory of which \"Daydreaming\" elicits a wistful performance from Day while she displays her jazzy feel for the saucy \"Control Yourself\" in a performance that’s right in the pocket and which ends with a playful \"Whew!\" Day adds to the jewels in her crown with a meltingly beautiful performance of Alec Wilder’s autumnal song \"Give Me Time.\" Andre Previn is ably assisted on a few numbers by Red Mitchell on bass and master drummer Shelly Manne. This recording remains a wonderful document of timeless masterpieces from two master performers. Richard Jessen\n\nDORIS DAY: SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY / LATIN FOR LOVERS. Come To Baby, Do!; It Could Happen To You; Sentimental Journey; Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars; 19 Others. (US issue) Collectables COL-CD-6867. 69:50. Both of these albums come late in Doris Day’s career (1964), yet they contain proof that Day was one of the best singers of all time. \"Sentimental Journey\" is a tribute to songs popular during the big band era updated for a new, fresh look. The Glenn Miller influence is present on two songs, \"Serenade In Blue,\" and \"At Last,\" both sung with crushing beauty by Day against a lush background of strings, woodwinds and voices provided by Mort Garson. There are two fine examples of Doris Day the jazz artist in effervescently bubbly performances of \"Come To Baby, Do!\" and \"I’m Beginning To See The Light.\" There are three visits to songs recorded by Doris Day when she was singing with Les Brown’s band, the standout performance being a steamier rendition by Day of \"Sentimental Journey\" which is more a journey of the heart than of a train ride! Two months after this album was finished came \"Latin For Lovers,\" a wonderfully smooth journey through the chacha, tango and the ever popular Bossa Nova. Mort Garson provides delicately romantic scores for this LP which covers four of Jobim’s songs on which Day lavishes great warmth and emotionally sensitive care to every twist and turn of the lyrics. \"Summer Night\" is the sleeper of this set for it was co-written by Bill Comstock (the tenor/guitarist with The Four Freshmen from 1960 - 1973) and noted jazz pianist Eugene DiNovi. Day successfully suggests the forlorn feeling of the lyrics. \"Be True To Me\" is another great song with another great performance by Doris Day who tries out her Spanish in a playful mood. And we must not forget \"Por Favor,\" an overwhelming favourite of mine endearingly sung by Doris Day. With her immaculate, well-timed phrasing and her experience as an actor, these performances stand out as more than welcome reminders of a great vocalist - Doris Day. Richard Jessen\n\nAN IRISH GUARDS BANDSTAND : WILLCOCKS : March : Sarafand, STANFORD : Overture: Shamus O’Brien, ANDERSON: Irish Suite – The Girl I Left Behind Me, The Minstrel Boy, B.W.O’DONNELL: Two Irish Tone Sketches, GRAHAM : Quick March : The Champion, ANSELL: Three Irish Dances, SULLIVAN: Quick March: Iolanthe, BRIGDEN: Celtic Dances, GRAINGER: Irish Tune from County Derry, BRASE: Irish Fantasia: Let Erin Remember. The Band of the Irish Guards D.O.M. Major Andrew Chatburn BA. ARCM psm. Specialist Recording Company SRC121, 70:50. Production values are as ever exceedingly high here and make no mistake, SRC’s claim that they record premier military bands with hitherto unheard of care and attention using the state of the art equipment in fine locations to produce the world’s best military band recordings is no idle boast. That they succeed spectacularly in their endeavours cannot be in doubt. The results are certainly deeply impressive and reflect great credit on the company’s commitment to this specialist niche in the music industry. An ‘Irish Guards Bandstand’ is to be the more warmly welcomed not least because after several recordings of John Ansell’s fine concert overture ‘Plymouth Hoe’ this collection commits more of this undervalued composer’s music to disc with the engaging ‘Three Irish Dances’. One might have thought this a worthy contender for Sanctuary Classics British Light Music Discoveries. Never mind, the Irish Guards Band more than make ample amends for such an omission. There’s a rollicking overture to Sir Charles Villiers Stanford’s comic opera Shamus O’Brien,contrasting nicely with the more reflective and atmospheric Two Irish Tone Sketches by Bertram Walton O’Donnell who held appointments as Musical Director of Royal Marine Bands at Portsmouth and Deal before subsequently moving to the BBC Military Band. Leroy Anderson’s Irish Suite is represented by three movements in an arrangement he himself made of the whole suite for military band. In J.D. Brigden’s Celtic Dances the band is joined surprisingly by the appearance of a solo violin played more than capably by Musician Victoria Evans who fully deserves her credit. The disc ends with an extended Irish Fantasia Let Erin Remember by Wilhelm Fritz Brase who despite the name was a colonel in the Irish Army! Many of the melodies in this pot-pourri may be unfamiliar to many of us but nonetheless brings the concert to a highly satisfying conclusion. In summary, an imaginative and refreshingly unhackneyed collection of music associated with the Emerald Isle and given the assured and skilful playing of the Irish Guards, should have deservedly wide appeal and not only to military band enthusiasts. The good news is that this is merely the first instalment in a series featuring a programme format much associated in the past with park and seaside bandstands. Oh! I nearly forgot. In case you are still wondering about the relevance of the inclusion of the Iolanthe quick march, well that has a somewhat tenuous Irish connection; it appears that Sir Arthur Sullivan’s father, professor of euphonium at Kneller Hall came originally from Tralee, County Cork! Roger Hyslop\n\nNAT KING COLE SINGS / GEORGE SHEARING QUINTET PLAYS. September Song; Pick Yourself Up; I Got It Bad And That Ain’t Good; Let There Be Love; Plus 8 other songs and 3 bonus tracks. String Choir arranged and conducted by Ralph Carmichael. 46:47. (US issue) Capitol Jazz 7243 5 25250 2 7. If ever there was a meeting of minds on a recording date, it would have be Nat King Cole and George Shearing. This lovely album was recorded December 19-22, 1961 and quickly became one of the classics in everyone’s record collection. Cole had originally recorded \"Pick Yourself Up\" at a break-neck tempo. Here, Shearing and Cole take things at a slow middle tempo which brings the full meaning of the lyrics into the light. \"Let There Be Love\" receives a rendition full of light optimism from both Cole and Shearing with drummer Shelly Manne’s softly driving support. The most challenging song must surely be \"Azure-Te\" with a highly inventive angularity. Praises go to Cole and Shearing for bravely going through this song. And there is surely nothing more heartbreaking than to listen to Cole’s poignant performance on \"I Got It Bad And That Ain’t Good\" and \"Lost April.\" The Latin rhythms influence Ralph Carmichael’s chart for Anderson’s \"Serenata,\" scored for woodwinds and percussion added to the strings cushioned by Shearing’s Quintet and Cole’s involving vocal. The added 3 tracks are welcome additions to this marvellous album of which \"The Game Of Love\" and \"Everything Happens To Me\" receive Latin influenced performances of great verve from both Cole and Shearing. The CD ends in a lovely way with a haunting ballad \"Guess I’ll Go Home.\" The remastering of the original stereo masters is superbly lifelike. Nothing could be a better tribute to two supreme masters than this wonderful recording.Richard Jessen\n\nNELSON RIDDLE Sea of Dreams Out of the Night, My Isle of Golden Dreams, Tangi Tahiti, Dream, There’s No You, Drifting and Dreaming, Easter Isle, Let’s Fall in Love, Polka Dots and Moonbeams, Put Your Dreams Away, Autumn Leaves, Sea of Dreams Love Tide Bali Ha’I, Ill Wind, East of the Sun, Till the End of Time, Caravan, Sweet Leilani, Take Me in your Arms, Solitude, Santana, Honeysuckle Rose, Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, Love Tide EMI 7243 5970532, 67:41 mins. Nelson Riddle fans will give this new CD a warm welcome, since it makes available again two of his great Capitol orchestral albums. Our friend Ray Purslow (of The Record Centre, Birmingham) suggested this release to EMI, so you can be sure that it is one which has been on many collectors’ ‘wants’ lists. The booklet reprints the original LP sleeves, both front and back, but you’ll probably need a magnifying glass to read the notes! Therefore it would have been nice to have a few paragraphs with some biographical details praising Nelson’s work in popular music, otherwise how will people coming across this CD in 20 or even 50 years hence realise just how great he was? David Ades\n\nVIKKI CARR; DISCOVERY! / DISCOVERY II. Surrey With The Fringe On Top; How Insensitive (Insensatez); Cuando Calienta El Sol Plus 21 Other Songs. EMI Two On One 7243 5 92653 2 2. The hallmarks of Vikki Carr’s recording career of forever searching for the best in music are ever present in this very welcome pairing of her second and third albums, originally released in April and October 1964 respectively. Things begin with a seductively swinging performance by Vikki Carr of \"Surrey With The Fringe On Top,\" followed by a Burt Bacharach song \"Cry Alone,\" performed with an appropriate torchiness by Carr. She really sparkles with bubbly performances of \"Bluesette\" (singing with the band in a beautiful if off mike vocalise) and \"Goodbye, Charlie.\" Her poise and control are heard to great advantage in the medley of two songs separated by 50 years: \"Poor Butterfly\" and \"Stay.\" Carr adds to her Bossa Nova songbook by singing a beautifully polished version of \"Insensitive\" by Jobim. A welcome addition is her second recording of a song in Spanish, a marvelously elegant \"Cuando Calienta El Sol.\" A nod to Frank Sinatra comes with \"My Melancholy Baby\" on which Carr sings only the opening verse much as Sinatra did with \"Stardust.\" Among the standout selections is a version of \"Invitation\" on which Carr meets the vocal challenges bravely and successfully. Bob Florence writes brilliantly timeless arrangements which gracefully support Vikki Carr’s efforts with intelligence and understanding as well as imagination. The remastering onto CD is simply fabulous. The accompanying booklet reproduces both album covers and their liner notes, giving an endearing charm to what is essentially a wonderfully reminder of not only how great of singer Vikki Carr was at this time but also just how this greatness is still there in abundance galore!Richard Jessen\n\nGLENN MILLER Masterpieces String of Pearls, Johnson Rag, Chattanooga Choo-Choo, Perfidia, At Last, American Patrol, Little Brown Jug, Moonlight Serenade, etc… 24 tracks Vocalion CDVS 1941, 77:19 mins. This attractive collection is superb value for money. Costing around £3, it includes booklet notes plus – of course – sound restoration by Mike Dutton to the standards we have all become accustomed to expect from him. The cheap price probably recognises that many collectors will already possess all the music, but at such a bargain price (and sounding so fresh) it should happily sell in its thousands. David Ades\n\nAnd still they come! When I first joined the Robert Farnon Society in 1997 a new Percy Faith CD was a real \"event\" trumpeted in these pages by the estimable Alan Bunting. Now with these five new releases the number of CDs available on the Collectables label alone amounts to 34.\n\nI know that several RFS members were eagerly looking forward to Music For Her [COL-CD-7562] and I can understand why. This is an archetypal Faith mid-50s issue featuring radiant string dominated arrangements of such marvellous melodies, mostly slow and romantic, as You’re My Everything, I’ll Be Seeing You, Take Me In Your Arms, The Nearness Of You, my favourite You’d Be So Nice To Come Home To, I’ll see You In My Dreams, I Concentrate On You, Everything I Have Is Yours and The Way You Look Tonight. No need to ask why the album is so called. The sound strikes me as being very rich for a mono recording. As this is the longest LP Percy ever recorded it could not be paired with any other to form the customary 2-on-1, so we are given \"bonus tracks\" of five singles – True Or False and Song For Sweethearts [Come Close], both written by Faith, Blue Mirage [Don’t Go], Not As A Stranger, The World Is Mine and We Won’t Say Goodbye – to make the playing time up to a tad under 67 minutes.\n\nOf the same vintage is Swing Low In Hi Fi [Col-CD-7611]. This is subtitled Spirituals For Orchestra and bears some comparison with Percy’s first two classic Christmas albums. The orchestra without vocals captures the deep emotions of the originals. I especially liked It’s Me Oh Lord [\"standing in the need of prayer\"] and you can almost smell the steam in Get On Board. There are 12 other equally well-known pieces here including Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Deep River, Steal Away and Go Down Moses; all are enhanced by Percy’s panoply of sound. For the first time with a Faith issue, Collectables have taken a leaf out of Vocalion’s book and given us a second CD for the price of one. It is something of a curiosity: A Look At Monaco, the soundtrack of a 1962 CBS television special with Percy conducting the Orchestra National De L’Opera De Monte Carlo playing his own music. Another attraction is the narration by none other than Princess Grace herself, although this may inhibit repeated listening. But I wouldn’t mind how many times I heard Percy’s impression of an Elephant inThe Zoo segment.\n\nMoving on to the 60s and stereo, we have our first 2-on-1: Held Over! Today’s Great Movie Themes / Leaving On A Jet Plane [COL-CD-7607] 68’20\". The first album was the final Faith foray into film [specifically Hollywood] music. It is a fairly lush affair with the strings, possibly, sounding a bit thinner than usual. Standout track for me is Come Saturday Morning, music by Fred Carlin [words written by Dory Previn for ‘The Sterile Cuckoo’]. Also enjoyable are Jerry Goldsmith’s Patton Theme,The Theme From \"Z\" [To Yelesto Pedi] by Mikis Theodorakis, Alfred Newman’s Airport Love Themeand George Delarue’s atmospheric closing number Theme From Anne Of The Thousand Days. Interestingly, in his original liner notes Gene Lees likens Faith to Robert Farnon, \"hearing his inner melodic lines, hearing how perfectly he ties up every loose end\". The album is purely orchestral but its pairing has the Percy Faith Chorus on every track. It is fascinating to compare the two versions ofRaindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head and Ballad Of Easy Rider that feature on both albums. Other tracks on the second album include Everybody’s Talkin’, Wedding Bell Blues, George Harrison’sSomething, and Colours – all very pleasant.\n\nTwo more albums with, this time, female only chorus throughout - maybe too much for some of us - are Those Were The Days / Love Theme From \"Romeo And Juliet\" [COL-CD-7608]. As well as the title tracks we get 20 numbers including a wordless choral version of Theme From \"A Summer Place\", Bacharach’s Promises, promises, Zorba, For Once In My Life, Little Green Apples, a bouncyAquarius and Good Morning Starshine, Fool On The Hill, and Joni Mitchell’s lovely Both Sides Now.\n\nCountry Bouquet [COL-CD-7606] is a classic featuring the Percy Faith Strings first issued in 1974, nine years after its illustrious predecessor, ‘Broadway Bouquet’, with which it was coupled on a UK reissue [Sony 4930472] in 1998. Here it is paired, less appropriately, with Disco Party, which includes Cherry Cherry, El Bimbo, The King Is Dead, 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 [Blow your Whistle], Mongonucleosis, Coldwater Morning, Hava Nagilah, and a previously unreleased Sabre Dance. Mercifully, ‘though, no vocals. The first album is gorgeous with such titles as The Most Beautiful Girl, El Paso, a dreamy Songbird, quite unlike its usual treatment, Annie’s Song, Behind Closed Doors, Sundown, For The Good Times and to end, Orange Blossom Special, a \"tour de force\" for strings almost worth the price of the disc.\n\nAltogether, then, a quality quintet with something for everybody.\n\nCollectables CDs are issued in the USA and are available from the Robert Farnon Society Record Service. Full track listings may be seen at htttp:/homepages.tesco.net/~alan.bunting/\n\nPeter Burt\n\nSome Vintage Sounds from Living Era\n\nReaders will know that the Sanctuary Group Living Era catalogue contains a large number of CDs featuring music from the 1920s to the 1960s, and most of them fall outside the normal scope covered by this magazine. However we know that some of you like to know what is new in this department, so we draw the following to your attention. We should add that they are all supported by comprehensive (and intelligent) booklet notes with detailed documentation, and an added bonus is the superb sound restoration by Alan Bunting.\n\nJAN GARBER AND HIS ORCHESTRA A Melody from the Sky recordings from 1924 to 1949 Living Era CDAJA5326, 73:30 mins.\n\nAL JOLSON Let Me Sing and I’m Happy 58 tracks recored between 1945 and 1950 Living Era CDAJS272 [2 CDs] 149 mins.\n\nBILLIE HOLIDAY Moanin’ Low new 2-CD set comprising CDs first issued in 1996 & 1999 (not featuring Alan Bunting’s sound restoration) CDAJS282, 151 mins.\n\nGUY MITCHELL My Truly Truly Fair 27 tracks from 1950-1953 also featuring Mindy Carson, Doris Day and Rosemary Clooney CDAJA5532\n\nAll Living Era CDs are available through the RFS Record Service.\n\nNew from Memoir\n\nAnother company which produces high quality compilations is Memoir. Like Sanctuary Living Era (above), not all their releases contain the kind of music usually featured in this magazine, but many of you like to know what is new.\n\nHITS OF 1953 faces competition from some other companies who have had the same idea, but the inclusion of several orchestral tracks helps to make this particular collection a more accurate reflection of the music scene 50 years ago. Among the usual names (Guy Mitchell, Jo Stafford, Nat King Cole etc.) you’ll find Leroy Anderson, Frank Chacksfield, Mantovani, Les Baxter and Ray Anthony. Memoir CDMOIR 585 [2 CDs], 139 mins. Memoir CDs are available from the RFS Record Service.\n\nNew Compilations from EMI\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to find something new to say about compliations. Usually they contain the ‘greatest hits’ of the artist concerned, and the inevitable question that crops up is: will the fans find anything new that they haven’t already got? To give an authoritative answer a reviewer needs some expert knowledge about what is already in the catalogue, which can cause problems if the CDs received are outside the normal scope of the writer or the magazine concerned. Which is a roundabout way of saying that I cannot be sure if the following CDs contain any gems that keen fans have been seeking for years, or if they are merely an attempt by the record company to make more money out of its back catalogue. However, EMI are one of the few friendly companies who are willing to send out promotional copies that haven’t been requested, and I have to admit that I have enjoyed listening to just about all of the following new releases, which I list in case they happen to be your favourites, too. Sorry – there isn’t space to list the titles, but you’ll probably find most of them in your local record store.\n\nSHIRLEY BASSEY ‘Finest Collection’ 36 tracks on 2 CDs featuring some fine popular and film songs from recent decades, all performed in Shirley’s inimitable and immaculate style EMI Gold 577 5852.\n\nMATT MONRO ‘The Collection’ Like the Shirley Bassey collection above, this is a 2-CD 36 track selection of superior songs, performed by a singer in a class of his own EMI Gold 577 5942\n\nGLEN CAMPBELL ‘Collection’ 34 tracks on 2 CDs, with a selection of songs that are indelibly linked to the 1960s and 1970s.

Unfortunately there are no notes, and even the modern composers do not have their first names quoted. EMI Gold 592 6922.\n\nDavid Ades\n\nBRITISH LIGHT OVERTURES Volume 2: Plymouth Hoe (John Ansell); Overture 125 (David Gow); Farnham Festival Overture (Sir Richard Rodney Bennett); The Moor of Venice (William Alwyn); A Scots Overture (John Gardner); The Lamprey (Michael Gryspeerdt); Scaramouche (Peter Hope); A Cleveland Overture (Anthony Hedges); A Snowdon Overture (Gareth Glyn) Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland Sanctuary Group White Line CDWHL2137, 62:54 mins. While the nautically jolly Plymouth Hoe will be familiar to many, the other splendid overtures on this new CD will not. David Gow’s 125 was written to launch British Rail’s new high speed train in 1976; Richard Rodney Bennett’s offering is self explanatory; William Alwyn’s Moor of Venice began as a brass band piece before Philip Lane orchestrated it; while John Gardner’s original work was in honour of wartime RAF Fighter Command before being rescored for the 1954 Proms. Michael Gryspeerdt was a doctor by profession but played in the Gloucestershire Symphony Orchestra which often repaired to The Lamprey pub near Gloucester Cathedral while Peter Hope needs no introduction, nor does Anthony Hedges whose Cleveland Overture is related to Hull University where he was domiciled for many years. Welshman, Gareth Glyn lives on Anglesey and looks out to Snowdonia so it is easy to see where he obtained his inspiration. All the music is in the best British Light Music tradition and well worth purchasing. Peter Worsley\n\nI have, alas, one or two serious misgivings about the makeup of this CD, bearing in mind the title British LIGHT Overtures. I can well imagine some impulse purchasers being misled into thinking that they are going to enjoy an hour or so of tuneful undemanding music which, for the most part, this recording doesn’t deliver. William Alwyn’s The Moor of Venice for example, has a particularly grim and doom-laden scenario which is fully realised in the music and could in no way be categorised as ‘light’. Surely a more accurate generic title (if Sanctuary Classics are going to continue with this series) would simply be ‘British Concert Overtures’. Furthermore the age profile, as represented by the compositional dates of these works is heavily tilted towards the modern with only two pre-dating 1950, one of which fortunately is John Ansell’s splendid, stirring and evocative salt-laden nautical overture Plymouth Hoe. Wonderful to have this at last in first-class modern sound, but for this listener at least leaving most of the remainder on this disc obstinately becalmed and (taking the nautical analogy a little further) outgunned and outranged! The best of the remainder for me was Rodney Bennett’s Farnham Festival Overture which includes skilful use of a piano, and Gareth Glyn’s appealing A Snowdon Overture which displays a charm and lyricism lacking in most of the remaining tracks, which I cannot imagine returning to very often. Playing time is somewhat miserly and there would have been ample room at the end for Ansell’s companion nautical overture The Windjammers, referred to in Philip Lane’s notes, and bringing about perhaps a satisfying concluding symmetry to this disc. Recording and performance are first rate, and if you think the contents will appeal to you don’t be put off by the strictures of a curmudgeonly reviewer. Incidentally, isn’t it about time that such significant figures of the past as Percy Fletcher, Montague Phillips, Haydn Wood, etc are represented in this series, assuming the compiler(s) can become a little less obsessed with ‘modern’? It would considerably increase the attractiveness and saleability of this series, and certainly I would have passed by Volume 2 had it not been for Plymouth Hoe! Roger Hyslop\n\nJOHNNY DOUGLAS ORCHESTRA I won’t dance, Yesterdays, A fine romance, The Carioca, They can’t take that away from me, The way you look tonight, I’m putting all my eggs in one basket, etc.. (22 tracks taken from the Decca LPs ‘Cheek to Cheek’ & ‘A Handful of Stars’ Dulcima DLCD118, 73:42 mins. Many of us will recall these two Decca LPs from over 45 years ago with pleasant memories. Johnny Douglas’s own arrangements have a bright, fresh sound that won him many admirers back in the 1950s, and this welcome reissue on his own Dulcima label will please many readers of this magazine. The LPs date from 1955 and 1957, so they were just too early for stereo, but the original tape masters still sound fine. To fit both albums on to one CD, it has been necessary to omit Like Someone in Love and How High the Moon from ‘A Handful of Stars’. Just one slight disappointment: the CD booklet doesn’t say anything about Johnny’s distinguished career. Maybe he was too modest! As you will have read elsewhere in this issue, sadly Johnny died on Easter Sunday, 20 April, so this CD will serve as a lasting tribute to his talent as a superlative arranger of popular songs. David Ades Dulcima CDs are available from the RFS Record Service for £13 [US $26] each.\n\nBRITISH STRING MINIATURES Volume 2: Set of Act Tunes and Dances (Henry Purcell); Serenade for the Birthday of Frederic Delius (Peter Warlock); Air and Dance (Delius); Serenade (Matthew Curtis); Suite – The Spanish Lady (Sir Edward Elgar); Serenata Concertante (Philip Lane) Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland Sanctuary Group White Line CDWHL2136. You may not hear this music played regularly on BBC Radio 3 which shows it must be good! It is a delightful light string music CD of the highest calibre, both ancient and modern(ised). Gareth Glyn’s characteristic Anglesey Sketches tell the story of different parts of the island in North Wales where the composer resides. Particularly pleasant are the scherzo Cemaes, reflecting exuberant summer beach activities while the elegy Moelfre, conjures up the hundreds of lost souls down the centuries whose ships foundered on this dangerous rocky coastline. Matthew Curtis and Philip Lane prove that modern serious string music can be thoroughly enjoyable while the rest of the disc can easily be guessed from the style of the well-known composers listed. Peter Worsley The Sanctuary Group White Line series of CDs are available from the RFS Record Service for £10 [US $20] each.\n\nCHARLES WILLIAMS ‘Radio and Television Memories No. 2’ Devil’s Galop, Girls in Grey, The Old Clockmaker, Quiet Stroll, Voice of London, High Adventure, Rhythm on Rails, Starlings, Young Ballerina, Pioneer Trail, Trolleybus, Model Railway, Great Day, In a Hurry, Summer Garden, Follow That Car, Sports Galop, Workroom, Full Speed, Ten Days’ Leave, Night Boat to Duiblin (film theme), Alf’s Button Afloat (film music), SOS, Searchlight, Convoy Attack, Barrage, Naval Action, Commandos, Said the Bells, Atlantic Brakers, War in the Jungle, Sons of the Air, March Winds, Storm on the Moors, Seaford Head, Drummer Boy, Speedway Galop and The Falcons Charles Williams and his Concert Orchestra, Queen’s Hall Light Orchestra, etc. THIS ENGLAND CR3. As many readers will know, a new CD of Charles Williams’ compositions was recorded in England earlier this year, and its release is eagerly awaited. But This England magazine has just got in first by issuing the first commercial CD devoted entirely to compositions by this master of Light Music, which will delight his many admirers. The CD (and cassette) coincide with an article on Charles Williams in the spring 2003 issue of Evergreen (the sister magazine of This England). The CD is full of radio and TV themes, such as \"Dick Barton – Special Agent\", BBC Television Newsreel, \"Jennings at School\", Farming, \"Friday Night is Music Night\", \"Top of the Bill\", \"Dan Dare\", television interludes and others. There are also two rare film soundtracks – from \"Night Boat to Dublin\" (1946) and a 1938 Crazy Gang Film \"Alf’s Button Afloat\"; predictably the sound quality is only average and the extracts are brief, but the second film is notable for chase music which Williams must have used later as the basis for his Devil’s Galop. These two tracks alone make this CD a real collector’s item. Keen Williams fans will probably have many of the other tracks, and the need to choose items that are out of copyright (more than 50 years old) means that the compilers have had to resort to a number of less well-known short mood music pieces from the Chappell Recorded Music Library of the 1940s. Readers who have previously purchased CDs from This England will know that they are lovingly produced by real enthusiasts. The gloss of the major record companies may be missing, and expensive sound restoration is beyond their reach. Having said that, the sound quality here is perfectly acceptable, with only occasional surface noise evident, and it has to be recognised that this may well be a ‘plus’ factor for some collectors who value authenticity. This release is strongly recommended as a slice of English Light Music history. The only thing lacking is precise information of the recording source and the actual orchestra playing on each item. David Ades This CD is only available direct from Evergreen Melodies, PO Box 52, Cheltenham, GL50 1YQ, England – tel. 01242 515156 or online at The CD costs £8.95 including postage; a shorter cassette version is available for £7.50.

The early stereo sound on the ‘Lecuona’ album is quite amazing. Equally exciting are the arrangements, presumably the work of maestro Stanley Black, although he did not generally make known the musicians who must have worked with him on some of his albums. He was so busy in the recording studios and concert halls, that he surely could not have scored all his music himself. The accompanying LP \"Place Pigalle\" employs much fewer musicians, mainly piano, accordion, percussion and occasionally electronic organ. The result is an atmospheric portrait of the kind of sounds one would love to hear emanating from a smoky French café or bistro, late into the evening. Sadly things are rather different today, but at least Stanley allows us to wallow in our nostalgia for what should be. These are two very different albums, but somehow they are each very satisfying in their own way. You may not want to play the entire CD through in one go, but I suspect that you will get a lot of enjoyment from selecting various portions from time to time, depending upon your mood.

Frank Chacksfield and his Orchestra Vocalion CDLK4167. This is really Leon Young’s CD, with his glorious arrangements excelling in these timeless interpretations of delightful melodies that still cannot fail to charm. The Chacksfield Orchestra really was a superb ensemble in the 1950s, strongly supported by the Decca sound technicians who were in a class all their own. First issued in 1954 and 1955, these albums just pre-date stereo, but the mono sound is fine and, after all, it is the music that really matters. As far as I am concerned, these interpretations are exactly how I wish to hear this kind of music performed. Rock ‘N’ Roll hadn’t yet fully embarked on the wrecking spree that killed off so many fine orchestras just a few years later.

I suppose that the only ‘problem’ with compilations such as this is deciding how many duplications you are prepared to tolerate. I haven’t checked in detail, but I should imagine that keen NKC collectors will already possess many of these tracks. However if your collection is currently devoid of this great singer, you could do far worse than purchase this bargain. David Ades\n\nTED HEATH AND HIS MUSIC\n\nHits I Missed & Al Jolson Classics Vocalion CDLK4168\n\nGreat Film Hits & Pop Hits Vocalion CDLK4170\n\nIt is difficult to find something new to say about Ted Heath and his Music. His great band contained some of the finest soloists that were around in Britain at the time, and all of his Decca LPs were outstanding in their own way. For example, the idea of a big band swinging Al Jolson hits might sound a bit far-fetched, but Heath certainly gets away with it. And how many band leaders would allow their egos to admit that they had actually missed some hits? Ted Heath fans continue to be very fortunate that so many of his albums are now available in superb remasterings such as these. David Ades\n\nMANTOVANI ORCHESTRA Italia Mia & Verzauberter Klang Aus Germany Vocalion CDLK4173. Just recently Vocalion have been treating us to several Decca albums featuring music from the continent of Europe, each being superb examples of the work of the respective orchestras. Frank Chacksfield with his ‘Evening in Rome’ (CDLK4167) has concentrated more on the popular sound of Italian music from the 1950s, whereas this Mantovani collection veers a little closer to the light classics. The sound and the performance are both stunning, and some readers may be reassured to know that the famous Mantovani ‘cascading strings’ sound is only used very sparingly (Decca probably insisted upon a touch of it here and there). The title track Italia Mia is one of Mantovani’s own compositions. This is the first time it has appeared on CD in Britain: it was previously on CD only in Japan – over a dozen years ago. The second LP was made for the continental market in June 1969, and did not appear in the UK, USA or Japan, so its revival should be of great interest to all Mantovani fans. Somewhat surprisingly, it was released in Australia as \"Enchanting Sounds from Germany\", but has been unavailable for many years. All of the tracks were big German hits, and many will be familiar to British ears. The German album is slightly more popular in style than theItalia Mia, but both fit nicely together, and this new CD is highly recommended.

I suppose an obvious comment to make is that the melodies on this CD are so well-known that other versions of them must already be in the collections of many readers. So it all really comes down to a question of whether or not this style of music is your cup of tea – and I use the term deliberately, because a lot of tea will have been drunk over the years while Sydney Lipton and his Orchestra were performing music such as this at some of London’s most fashionable establishments. Today’s younger record buyers might find this rather quaint, but for those of us with longer melodies it will be a welcome addition to our collections. David Ades\n\nEDWARD GERMAN Coronation March and Hymn, Henry VIII - Three Dances, Welsh Rhapsody, Much Ado About Nothing, Bourée and Gigue, Nell Gwynn -Three Dances, Gipsy Suite - Four Characteristic Dances, Tom Jones -Three Dances Band of the Welsh Guards directed by Major Philip Shannon MBE. Specialist Recording Company SRC 104 69 mins. This is a further instalment in SRC's continuing series featuring CDs devoted to a single British composer and performed by one of our premier military bands - in this case the Welsh Guards. With the notable exception of Marco Polo who have included him in their British Light Music Series (No. 8.223419) and issued two volumes of his more serious music (Nos. 8.223695 & 8.223726), Sir Edward German has been largely neglected by the recording companies, so this new SRC CD is particularly welcome. Whilst some of these items have already appeared on the aforementioned Marco Polo album - Gipsy Suite, Henry VIII and Nell Gwynn Dances - none are exactly over-represented in the current catalogue. The attractions of this issue are considerably enhanced by the inclusion of several rarities. The Coronation March and Hymn(for George V’s Coronation) is based on themes from Henry VIII, the excerpts from Much Ado About Nothing are quite delightful and well worth a hearing whilst there are no modern recordings extant of the Tom Jones Dances. Nimble and agile woodwind playing are demanded in many of the faster dance movements and the Welsh Guards are fully equal to the challenges made upon them. Like the Sullivan disc the sessions were taped in the spacious acoustics of the Chapel, The Royal Hospital Chelsea. A very good buy!

An excellent selection of early Mayerl masterpieces, including selections from two of his rarely heard musicals from the Thirties, Nippy and Sporting Love. Sennen Cove is the splendid full orchestral version conducted by Billy himself, while Ray Noble and Jack Hylton take the baton forHave a Heart and Indispensable You respectively. All the other tracks are solos played at the height of his fame by Mayerl, whose fantastic skills were described in a slow-motion film of the time as \"Lightning Fingers\". Peter Dempsey has done a wonderful job of remastering, including possibly the first ever piano recordings made by the new electrical process in Britain, namely All-Of-A-Twist andEskimo Shivers on 24th September, 1925. All in all a very good buy at bargain price.

First of all he wrote the book … now our member Serge Elhaik has penned the booklet notes (in English and French) for this very entertaining and welcome new release. In 1968 Paul Mauriat’s Love Is Blue was top of the charts in the USA for seven weeks, firmly establishing his credentials as a top international conductor. Mauriat is also highly respected as a songwriter and arranger, as his work with the likes of Charles Aznavour and Mireille Mathieu will testify. His later career found him much in demand in Japan, where it is reckoned that he gave at least 1,200 concerts until 1998. The Paul Mauriat Orchestra still continues under Gilles Gambus. This CD presents the maestro in some of his most popular recordings (seven are his own compositions), and it should win him many new admirers. David Ades\n\nTHE FILM MUSIC OF RICHARD ADDINSELL Goodbye Mr. Chips; Dangerous Moonlight (Warsaw Concerto); Love on the Dole; Blithe Spirit; The Black Rose; Scrooge; Tom Brown’s Schooldays; The Admirable Crichton; Out of the Clouds (Flame Tango). BBC Philharmonic conducted by Rumon Gamba Chandos CHAN 10046, 79:50 minutes. A real feast of light music for cinema and non-cinemagoers alike. The vast majority of these orchestral masterpieces have been reconstructed by Philip Lane and what a labour of love was that! By listening to the soundtrack over and over again he has recreated the deliberately destroyed scores and put back into the musical repertoire what would surely have been lost for ever. It seems strange to us now that such musical gems were discarded as worthless once the movie had been made but there was so much good music around at the time that it is understandable, if not forgivable. The recordings are first class with the addition of the choirs of both Chetham’s and Manchester Cathedral, plus the piano playing of Martin Roscoe in The Warsaw Concerto. If you remember the films then you will remember the music but even if you are too young it doesn’t matter because the splendid music stands alone. Peter Worsley\n\nWhile welcoming this release wholeheartedly, it is only right that I should draw readers’ attention to the previous two CDs of Addinsell’s Film Music (ASV CDWHL2108 & 2115). Philip Lane was also involved with both of these, and it is understandable that Chandos would wish to include many of Addinsell’s best-known works, so it is inevitable that some duplications have occurred. However, on this latest release, the only items that may already be in the hands of keen collectors are Warsaw Concerto, Blithe Spirit, and Scrooge. This not only serves to illustrate the considerable output achieved by Addinsell, but it should also reassure his admirers that they must not hesitate to acquire this latest release. Full marks also for the excellent booklet. David Ades\n\n…Warsaw Concerto – that seemingly indestructible veteran evergreen – receives from Martin Roscow a performance of genuine symphonic breadth imbuing the piece with a surprising verdant freshness which is very appealing. A highlight for me was the music from Love On The Dole which I found particularly poignant and touching. Rumon Gamba deftly steers the highly accomplished and polished BBC Philharmonic through these scores with unerring sensitivity and complete sympathy. Roger Hyslop This CD is available from the RFS Record Service for £12 [US $24].\n\nMARTIN BÖTTCHER Film Music Unser Haus in Kamerun, Der Fälscher von London, Strasse der Verheissung, Auf Engel Schiesst Man Nicht, Lufthansa-Suite plus 3 bonus tracks (Germany) Peermusic CD 0103. I feel sure that our German members will be familiar with the work of Martin Bőttcher – and rightly so, because his music is inventive and very pleasing. This new CD (conceived by our member Volker Rippe) offers the music from five films, plus three bonus tracks which I suspect were popular singles in the 1960s. The first film Unser Haus in Kamerun has a very pleasant theme, which is attractively arranged in a variety of moods with strings well to the fore. Several of the tracks would stand up very well on their own as fine examples of production music. Der Fälscher von London veers more towards jazz and (presumably!) the seamier side of London night life. A somewhat similar style is evident in Strasse der Verheissung, with nods towards West Coast Jazz and the more blatant pop sounds of the 1960s. Glenn Miller sounds emerge (intentionally) in Auf Engel Schiesst Man Nicht. Then bright holiday sounds take over in the Lufthansa-Suite. This is an interesting collection, with varied styles that prove that the composer can turn his talents towards any kind of mood, as required by the storylines in the films. The CD booklet (in German only) reproduces four film posters – a ‘plus’ point for collectors of film music. Scores such as this deserve to be preserved for posterity. David Ades\n\nTED HEATH & HIS MUSIC Listen To My Music Opus 1; East of the Sun; Bakerloo Non-Stop; Donegal Cradle Song; On Ilkla Moor Baht’at; Baia; London Suite (Chelsea, Whitechapel, Limehouse, Bond Street, Piccadilly, Soho): Deep Forest; Pagan Love Song; You Go To My Head; Dark Eyes; Harlem Nocturne; Song of the Vagabonds; Listen To My Music; Hindustan; Lady Byrd; Sophisticated Lady; Lyonia; Euphoria; Cuban Crescendo; Roumanian Roundabout. Sanctuary Group Living Era CD AJA 5459. Ted Heath lovers will be pleased with this CD which includes Fats Waller’s complete London Suite which was released before the wartime Waller piano solo originals (which were destroyed in the Blitz) were commercially recorded from inferior copies made at the time. All the tracks were mono and made between 1944 and 1950 when Heath was arguably at his peak. The band was initially formed at the behest of the BBC Variety Department for broadcasting purposes only but soon outgrew this role and became Britain’s most famous big band. A fine tribute to a fine set of musicians. Edmund Whitehouse\n\nLEROY ANDERSON – ‘Blue Tango’ Sleigh Ride, Promenade, The Waltzing Cat, The Syncopated Clock, Saraband, Serenata, Jazz Pizzicato … Jazz Legato, A Trumpeter’s Lullaby, Plink Plank Plunk, Horse and Buggy, Belle of the Ball, Blue Tango, China Doll, The Penny-Whistle Song, Fiddle-Faddle, The Phantom Regiment, Irish Suite, Christmas Festival Leroy Anderson and his ‘Pops’ Concert Orchestra Sanctuary Group Living Era CDAJA5481, 75:12 mins. This new CD has been compiled by RFS member David Lennick (who is based in Ontario, Canada), so the recording information given in the booklet refers to North America. Which is why all of the 78s are quoted as having Decca catalogue numbers, but this is the US Decca company, not the familiar British one. (To avoid confusion, I feel that there should have been a note in the CD booklet to explain this). In the UK these tracks were issued on Brunswick with completely different catalogue numbers, although the matrix numbers will have been the same. The recordings date from 11 September 1950 to 5 November 1952, and the running order of the tracks simply reflects the sequence in which they were released in the USA (except for the final item). In 2002 Jasmine issued a CD containing the first 16 titles (JASMCD 2580 – reviewed in JIM 152), but these are not all the same performances. (Jasmine gives no recording information whatsoever, and there was insufficient time available to make further investigations before this review had to be ready for the printers. If any readers can shed more light on this, we’ll be pleased to give the relevant details in a future issue). Clearly this new Living Era release is better value because it also contains Anderson’s six-movement Irish Suite plus the longer eight-minute version of his Christmas Festival. For the sake of completeness, I should remind readers that in 1992 MCA Records/Good Music in the USA released ‘Blue Tango -The Original Hit Recordings of Leroy Anderson’ on MSD 35334. This had 20 tracks, although Jazz Pizzicato and Jazz Legato were put on two different tracks, and incredibly separated by four other numbers – clearly the compiler had little regard for Anderson’s original concept. The remaining three ‘extra’ tracks were later works – Forgotten Dreams, Sandpaper Ballet and Bugler’s Holiday. Surprisingly Horse and Buggy was dropped in favour of The Minstrel Boy. The later stereo recordings by Leroy Anderson are on the 2-CD set ‘The Leroy Anderson Collection’ (MCA MCAD2-9815) so there have already been several opportunities for collectors to obtain the composer’s own performances on CD. If anyone reading this review still lacks Leroy Anderson on their CD shelves, then my advice is to choose this latest release which is the best now available. The sound quality is very good (although the trumpets in The Wearing of the Green sound decidedly tipsy!), and these original performances from the beginning of the 1950s stand as the definitive versions. David Ades\n\nBOB HOPE ‘Thanks for the Memory’ Title track, Two Sleepy People, The Lady’s in Love with You, Penthouse Serenade, Put it There Pal, The Road to Morocco, My Favourite Brunette, Beside You, Buttons and Bows, That’s Not the Knot, Lucky Us, Ain’t we Got Fun, Blind Date, Goodnight Irene, Home on the Range, Wing Ding Tonight, Am I in Love, A Four-Legged Friend, Hoots Mon, Chicago Style, The Road to Bali, Merry-Go-Runaround Living Era CDAJA5493, 76:30 mins. British-born Bob Hope has become an American institution, and he had the rare honour of hearing warm tributes paid to him by the US Congress a few years ago when what might be termed a ‘premature’ announcement of his death was made. Assuming that he doesn’t fall at the last hurdle, by the time you read this he will have celebrated his 100th birthday on 29 May, and this new CD is therefore both a timely and a fitting tribute to his rather sparse recording career. Once again, the compiler credits are in the name of ‘our’ David Lennick, so my previous comments (on the Leroy Anderson CD above) about North American recordings details apply here as well. If Bob wasn’t exactly prolific in the recording studios, at least what he did commit to wax was worthy of preservation, proving that he had an astute regard for quality, rather than quantity. On several tracks he is joined by the likes of Bing Crosby, Shirley Ross, Dorothy Lamour, Margaret Whiting and Jane Russell, and there are extra tracks (not listed above) from radio shows and visits to the troops, for which he became something of a legend in World War 2. Bob’s films are represented with numbers from several Roadfilms, plus The Paleface and Son of Paleface – the latter being a rare example of a sequel being better than the original. The gremlins appear to have made mistakes on two track titles, but apart from that minor niggle this is a splendid production in all respects. David Ades All Sanctuary Group Living Era CDs are available from the RFS Record Service for £8 [US $16] each.\n\nBEST OF THE FIFTIES Various Artists 6 CD set, EMI GOLD 582 5542. Selling for around £20 this collection ought to be good value, although the music on the 6 CDs would easily fit on to 4. Also EMI are on decidedly dodgy ground with the assertion that these are \"original artists … original hits\" when many are cover versions by EMI contract artists. As for the 1950s tag, how can you describe Judy Garland’s Over The Rainbow in this way (\"The Wizard of Oz\" came out in 1939)? This is a very mixed bag, with hardly any instrumental items. Just treat it as yet another compilation: it certainly isn’t an accurate portrayal of the overall music scene in the 1950s as I remember it. David Ades\n\nNORMAN WISDOM ‘The Very Best of …’ EMI GOLD 582 6522. I haven’t listed the tracks because you’d be hard pressed to associate many of the titles with Sir Norman. Missing is his big number (accompanied by Robert Farnon) from the ice show \"London Melody\" which first made his name, and it would have been nice to have that catchy tune I’d Like to Put on Record from \"Trouble in Store\" (of course Don’t Laugh at Me is included). Surprisingly absent also are those two classic sides he did with Joyce Grenfell (remember Narcissus?). Norman has a pleasant voice, and he usually had excellent orchestrations backing him. This collection is quite good, but with a little more thought it could have been so much better. David Ades\n\nHUMPHREY LYTTELTON ‘The Best of …’ EMI GOLD 583 2802. This is a 3-CD box set which you should be able to pick up for around £12. I have to admit that my knowledge of Humph’s recordings is limited, so I cannot say if there are any glaring gaps among the 60 titles. It begins with Bad Penny Blues so perhaps the omens are good! Whether or not your own particular favourites are all here, I suspect that few will disagree that this is very good value. David Ades\n\nADAM FAITH What Do You Want, Poor Me, Someone Else’s Baby etc. 24 tracks. EMI GOLD 583 1132. Pop singers don’t usually get included in this feature, but we know that a number of our readers are keen fans of John Barry, so they may be interested in this new release. Faith’s early successes were distinguished by the pizzicato and strings effects cleverly achieved by John Barry, with a little help from the Abbey Road echo chamber. Thanks to Hit and Miss, the signature tune of BBC TV’s \"Juke Box Jury\", John Barry was well known to pop fans around 40 years ago, and he certainly helped young Terence Nelhams (aka AF), who died earlier this year on 8 March aged 62.David Ades\n\nANNE SHELTON The Best of … Let’s Face the Music and Dance, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, Bridge of Sighs, If I Give My Heart To You etc. 23 tracks. EMI GOLD 584 0152. Anne Shelton has been quite well served with CD reissues just recently, but mainly they have concentrated on her repertoire from the 1940s. This new collection from EMI comes mainly from the 1950s, and it includes a mixture of hits of the day plus a few well-loved standards. Anne was a very good singer, so we mention this for the benefit of her many admirers.

Total Time 158 minutes Codename Music CMCD1970. \"Diamonds are forever\" should capture your mind when you see the cover of this well compiled CD of BBC and ITV Daytime Interlude classics from the late 1960’s and 1970’s. You should be mesmerized by the cover alone. On opening this double CD will unfold one primary disc and one secondary disc from schooldays past containing 64 tracks of catchy little pieces of light musical charm played before schools and children’s programmes on TV. Plus two distinctive bonus tracks featuring the primary school’s diamonds music and the secondary school’s diamonds music. The whole school timetable can be fondly remembered here as you listen to well loved and often aired musical miniatures from the world famous Chappell Recorded Music Library featuring enchanting pieces from the pens and pencils of John Cacavas, Brian Fahey, Roger Webb, Gordon Franks and Robert Farnon to name a few. So rustle up your old school kit and make space in your satchel for this little gem from days gone by. Malcolm Batchelor\n\nThe thought of 64 Chappell tracks should be enough to tempt many RFS members to buy this great new collection, especially as so many of the numbers will not already be in your collections. Steven Willis is a true enthusiast who has clearly put his heart into this compilation … and it shows!

This is more or less Kosty’s recording career in microcosm, ranging from 12\" 78s of anything up to 60 years ago (some of which …the Lehar, Stauss, Kalman, Stolz and Oscar Straus….startes me off as a collector) , on through Rodgers and Gershwin of the mid–forties and on to some early stereo recordings. Those six tracks are hardly typical of the Kostelanetz we admired for something like 30 years, either technically or musically. One, You Made Me Love You is so bad in both respects it’s all one can do to listen to it, but that is only one title out of many. Otherwise this ’Miscellany’ is a typical cross section of Kostelanetz’s’ work in all fields over the years and can be safely recommended.

It must be forty years since I had a Polydor/MGM double LP called \" Like Young, Like Blue \", which turned out to be one of those albums one keeps coming back to when all else fails to satisfy. Here is the identical set complete on a very welcome CD from our friend Frank Bristow, with both soloist and orchestra on top form. Previn and Rose are equally adept as interpreters also in no fewer than eight cases, composers of standard music such as we used to know in those happy days of yore. I would imagine most JIM readers will be familiar with these recordings, so if your original copies have been showing signs of wear, now is your chance to replace them.

Frank Bristow FBCD95 78:46mins. \"Easy Listening\" as an album title sounds most inappropriate to me. One thing the musicianly David Rose was not was a mere purveyor of bland mood music, as this collection of familiar and well loved standards proves. The basic material stems from three American MGM LP’s, \"21 Channel Sound\", \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Spectacular Strings\", none of which as far as I have been able to ascertain, were ever issued in the U.K. Everything is nicely contrasted as far as tempi and styles are concerned, varying between big band sounds and the lush Rose string sound. It’s always perfect and musicianly and in no way can it be classed as \"Easy Listening\". Arthur Jackson Editor: Sorry to correct Arthur, but to avoid correspondence(!) \"21 Channel Sound\" was released in Britain – on MGM C901 and MGM CD 6057 (stereo).\n\nJOHN PHILIP SOUSA, Works For Wind Band – Volume 3 The Corocan Cadets, Semper Fidelis, Selections from : The Free Lance, The New York Hiippodrome, La Flor di Sevilla, Waltzes from ‘El Capitan’, A Century of Progress Suite: The Last Days of Pompeii, The White Rose, With Pleasure, Dance Hilarious, The Belle of Chicago, The National Game. Royal Artillery Band conducted by Keith Brion. Naxos 8.559092 54mins. Naxos have ambitiously set their sights on recording Sousa’s Wind Band music in its entirety, so this will be a substantial and significant series with several more instalments apparently already in the can. They have invested very wisely in the Royal Artillery Band, one of the largest and best bands in the British Army and in obtaining the services of Keith Brion, an American conductor who is a specialist in Sousa’s period style. The third volume was recorded in Woolwich Town Hall, a venue where often the Royal Artillery Orchestra have given public concerts. Sousa said a march ‘should make a man with a wooden leg step out‘ and that he succeeded spectacularly in his own philosophy cannot be in doubt. All the marches are played here with quite superb panache and swagger. La Flor de Sevilla composed for the Ibero – American Exposition in 1929 has a particularly attractive and beguiling trio, whilst A Century of Progress written in the year prior to his death showed the ‘March King’ had lost none of his flair for the idiom. The selection from the 1905 operetta The Free Lance, contains some appealing melodies, whilst the early suite The Last Days of Pompeii (which includes harp) has some interesting special effects as does the final piece on the disc The National Game. This is a series to collect and cherish especially at the Naxos price and one waits impatiently for Volume 4. Incidentally, this disc has the rare distinction for a military band CD in being ‘mentioned in despatches‘ during BBC Radio 3’s CD Review on Saturday 15th March, when Semper Fidelis followed on from a particularly unattractive and impenetrable piece by Schnittke!\n\nRoger Hyslop\n\nProduction Music CDs\n\nBIG SCREEN LITTLE SCREEN 2-CD collection of Archive tracks classified as Horror, The Westerns, Epics & Adventure and Dark Drama Cavendish CAV CD 155. This interesting collection has been put together by André Leon, from the Boosey & Hawkes archives, some dating back to 78s issued in the 1950s. Many of the tracks are quite short in duration, and the CDs are obviously not intended for leisure listening at home. But there are some interesting tracks that will appeal to enthusiasts, and the list of featured composers illustrates the quality of the writing – Trevor Duncan, Don Banks, John Scott, Eugene Cines, Joseph Cacciola, Dudley Simpson and Monia Liter, among others. Our good friend Heinz Herschmann is represented by his classic 78 The Galleon, and I have to say that it sounds better here than it did on his own Apollo Sound CD APSCD 205. Trevor Duncan’s gems include Revelation, four tracks of Mob Violence and two tracks from The Unwanted – The Boy. Enthusiasts are fortunate to have the opportunity to hear mood music of this calibre.

This new release showcases the concert works of some of the most interesting British cinema composers in a collection of world premiere recordings, featuring the likes of ‘Carry On’ film composers Bruce Montgomery and Eric Rogers, whose Palladium Symphony was inspired by his time conducting and composing for ITV’sSunday Night at the London Palladium.

Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland. MARCO POLO 8.225185, total timing 72:57 mins. Here at last is a whole CD devoted to this most English of composers who is rightly acknowledged as the country’s leading expert on recreating and re-scoring lost film music. Nobody has done as much as Philip Lane in promoting and producing CDs of British Light Music in recent years and this first release of his own music is therefore to be welcomed with open arms. Gloucestershire-born it is not surprising that some of the tunes relate to the Cotswolds and his home town of Cheltenham. Prestbury Park is the posh name for Cheltenham Racecourse, Seven Springs is the source of the River Thames, while Pittville Promenade, based on the composer’s perambulations as a child in Pittville Park, could just as well apply to Cheltenham Promenade where earlier this century the aristocracy and those \"below stairs\" were not allowed to meet! Cleeve Idyll relates to the highest point on the Cotswolds, Badminton House conjures up images of jodhpurred-young ladies leaping fences on their ponies, while Wassail Songevokes young bobble-hatted and scarf-clad carollers singing underneath home made lanterns at Christmas. All the music on this disc is what one would expect from a master craftsman - soothing, jaunty, moving, jolly, evocative but above all, thoroughly enjoyable. No crash-bang-wallop and discordant assaults on the ear here, just excellent tuneful music which deserves to be widely heard.\n\nPeter Worsley Marco Polo CDs are available through the RFS Record Service – price £12 (US $24).\n\nTHE FILM MUSIC OF WILLIAM ALWYN – Volume 2 The Crimson Pirate, Green Girdle,Take my Life, A Night to Remember, The Card, Desert Victory, Svengali, The Winslow Boy, In Search of the Castaways, State Secret BBC Philharmonic conducted by Rumon Gamba Chandos CHAN 9959, total timing 77:29 mins. Back in 1993 Chandos gave us the first volume of Alwyn’s film scores (CHAN 9243), arranged by the late Christopher Palmer. Readers may recall that Palmer was involved in many fine albums of film music, and his death at an early age was regarded as a great loss. Fortunately his pioneering work in reconstructing ‘lost’ scores has been continued by Philip Lane, who deserves the thanks of us all for his superb achievements in this field. Many of the films in this collection regularly turn up on our television screens, but only three in this selection have been previously available in any form. Rumon Gamba has deservedly received much praise for his previous recordings, and his empathy with Alwyn is evident. Apart from the music, the CD booklet is excellent, with comprehensive notes and many photographs. These two CDs of Alwyn’s film music form an important part of the history of the British film industry in the 20th century, and we can only applaud Chandos for making this music available to a wide audience. David Ades All CDs in the Chandos catalogue can be ordered from the RFS Record Service – full price issues are £12 (US $24) each.\n\nANDRE KOSTELANETZ conducts Show Boat, South Pacific, Slaughter on Tenth Avenue, An American in Paris and Porgy and Bess Philadelphia Orchestra etc. (USA) Collectables COL-CD-6800, 73:31 mins. These classic performances from 1951-1954 provide glorious examples of the American musical theatre. Slaughter on Tenth Avenueis the same recording as on the recent Vocalion CD, and of course the other works will all be familiar, although not necessarily in these arrangements. Show Boat is a major opus in its own right, lasting some 22 minutes. Gershwin, Rodgers and Kern have seldom sounded better than this. David Ades\n\nANDRE KOSTELANETZ conducting his own Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic: \"A Kostelanetz Concert\" Invitation to the Dance (Weber); La Bamba de Vera Cruz (Tucci); Vocalise (Rachmaninov); Mosquito Dance (White); Flight of the Bumble Bee (Rimsky-Korsakov); Minuet (Boccerini); Mississippi Suite (Grofé); Marche Miniature, None But the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky); Roumanian Rhapsody (Enesco); Circus Overture (Toch); Love of Three Oranges – March, Wedding Suite (Prokoviev); Saturday Night (Kay); Stars and Stripes Forever (Sousa) (Australia) FRANK BRISTOW 77:56 mins. The latest CD from Frank Bristow in Australia is completely classical in format which, of course, offers no scope for the unique and individual Kostelanetz arrangements. There are standard settings of Invitation to the Dance, Bumble Bee, Boccherini’s Minuet, Love of Three Oranges and odd bits of Tchaik and Rach, but some may be less familiar. For instance, Hershey Kay’s Saturday Night from his ‘Western Symphony’ is quite superb, there’s a masterly performance of the Mississippi Suite, Ernst Toch’s descriptive overture to Circus (which may grow on me in time),Roumanian Rhapsody and, especially, the Wedding Suite from Prokoviev’s ballet \"Stone Flower\" which was new to me. This is quite typical of the kind of programme Kosty used to present in his Lincoln Centre Promenades with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony, which he conducts here in these Columbia and Coronet recordings, apart from six tracks by his own orchestra.

This recent release in the Naxos ‘American Classics’ series is a reissue of a Naxos International CD from 1989 (8.990011) plus one extra track – Sleigh Ride. Around this time Richard Hayman was involved in a mammoth recording project in Czechoslovakia (as it was then) resulting in 20 or more collections of easy listening music. Considering their budget price, they were good value, but whether or not you wish to add this Leroy Anderson CD to your collection will probably depend upon two factors: the state of your finances, and if the music of this great American composer is new to you. Readers of this magazine who admire Anderson are likely to have already bought the CDs of his own performances of these (and other) works, and to be perfectly frank they are preferable. Under the composer’s baton these works truly sparkle; Hayman’s East European musicians sound as though they are going through the motions for the money, not because they genuinely love the music. But for only £5 you can hardly quibble. David Ades\n\nBAX Violin Concerto [Eda Kersey & BBCS"
