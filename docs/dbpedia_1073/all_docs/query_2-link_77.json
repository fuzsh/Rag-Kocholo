        "text": "Praise for A Passion for Society\n\n\"A Passion for Society is a stirring rejection of the cult of dispassion in modern anthropology and sociology and a brisk rehabilitation of attempts to link fellow-feeling to pragmatic (and, yes, humanitarian) efforts to lessen the suffering of others. This defense of caring and caregiving revives old lessons and offers new ones, burnishing the example of great social theorists and of almost-forgotten ones. Iain Wilkinson and Arthur Kleinman are not trying to win an argument, although they do, but rather to offer a hopeful and humane intellectual basis for what is, fundamentally and unapologetically, a moral stance: against indifference and cynicism and inaction, and for their opposites. This fierce book is both balm and compass.\"\n\n—Paul Farmer, MD, PhD, Harvard Medical School, Partners In Health, The Brigham and Women’s Hospital\n\nThe world is stuffed full of unbearable human misery. Every day billions of people in the world find themselves living in tragic desperation. What is to be done? How can a social science deal with this best? In this challenging, committed, and original study, Wilkinson and Kleinman provide a history and appreciation of the study of social suffering and urge us to place this at the heart of understanding society by putting compassion and practical care at its core. Critical of the formalism, distance, and coldness of both academic life and social science, the book creates new dialogues. It deserves to become a landmark in redirecting social science to work more passionately to make the world a kinder place.\n\n—Ken Plummer, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, Essex University\n\nIn their analysis of ‘the problem of suffering,’ Wilkinson and Kleinman provide a thoroughly convincing argument for a new approach to social theory and social research practice—one that is compassionate, interventionist, and globally oriented, and thus better able to address the pressing issues that define our age.\n\n—Alan Petersen, Professor of Sociology, Monash University\n\nCALIFORNIA SERIES IN PUBLIC ANTHROPOLOGY\n\nThe California Series in Public Anthropology emphasizes the anthropologist’s role as an engaged intellectual. It continues anthropology’s commitment to being an ethnographic witness, to describing, in human terms, how life is lived beyond the borders of many readers’ experiences. But it also adds a commitment, through ethnography, to reframing the terms of public debate-transforming received, accepted understandings of social issues with new insights, new framings.\n\nSeries Editor: Robert Borofsky (Hawaii Pacific University)\n\nContributing Editors: Philippe Bourgois (University of Pennsylvania), Paul Farmer (Partners In Health), Alex Hinton (Rutgers University), Carolyn Nordstrom (University of Notre Dame), and Nancy Scheper-Hughes (UC Berkeley)\n\nUniversity of California Press Editor: Naomi Schneider\n\nA Passion for Society\n\nA Passion for Society\n\nHOW WE THINK ABOUT HUMAN SUFFERING\n\nIain Wilkinson and Arthur Kleinman\n\nUC Logo\n\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS\n\nUniversity of California Press, one of the most distinguished university presses in the United States, enriches lives around the world by advancing scholarship in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.

An elderly Shanghainese now, he had come from a desperately poor, tiny village in Anhui Province. A friend of a friend, he was telling me how the Great Leap famine of 1960 had destroyed his family: one death from starvation following another. And how he himself had run away with two cousins to a Shanghai suburban town, where he had survived only to be caught up half a decade later in the mass violence of the Cultural Revolution. My life was bitter, he said. I had to endure great hardship. This was not a problem just for me: many, many fared the same. We felt, in our bodies, we saw terrible, horrible things. When I think back, I wonder how I survived. Even now, all these years later, I am carrying with me this grief. (Interview with Arthur Kleinman, Shanghai, 2006)\n\nA small, elderly American woman now, with lively eyes and a charming but constrained expression, she quickly became solemn as she read from the books she had written about her experience in the Auschwitz death camp: bare, unadorned prose and saddening poetry conveyed the systematic brutality and inhuman horror of her Holocaust life. (Arthur Kleinman, conversation with Judith Sherman, Harvard University, 2013)\n\nBoth of these witnesses lived through now iconic times of mass violence. Their painful memories conjure not just their own, but widespread social suffering. If that collective experience of death, starvation, injury, forced displacement, and despair sounds like history, then read today’s newspaper, watch the nightly news, or better yet speak with refugees in your community who came from one of the dozens of wars, civil conflicts, floods, earthquakes, or epidemics that are devastating human communities in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. And then speak to the poor, marginal, and broken families in Europe and America who are living the effects of structural violence in unemployment, inadequate schooling, substance abuse, mental illness, and chronic stress-related physical conditions. They too are experiencing social suffering—what Hannah Arendt referred to as the social problem.\n\nThis modern sensibility that human misery, no matter how deeply interior in the individual, is often a collective experience resulting from large-scale societal forces that in turn break neighborhoods, villages, networks, and families emerged out of the concern of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American thinkers with what human beings have had to endure. These early pioneers of social inquiry were, as we still are today, moved to witness and respond by doing something to assist not just individuals caught in desperate conditions, but whole populations, communities, and society at large. They understood that the sources and consequences of what was the matter were part of society itself, so that the interventions also had to be social.\n\nThese humanitarian witnesses and critics, who exposed social suffering in order to remedy human conditions were philosophers, novelists, poets, journalists, and reformers. Out of their efforts to question, understand, change, improve, and heal social worlds come what we now call social science, whose origins, then, are to be found in a shared conviction that the root causes of human misery lie in social conditions and that social theories, research, and policy are needed for societal reform to improve human futures.\n\nThe tendrils transmitting the founders’ passion for practices of care to transform society influence medical anthropologists like Jim Yong Kim, currently president of the World Bank, and Paul Farmer, a leading figure in global health, who together developed a community-based model of accompaniment for treating AIDS and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis among the poor in Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Peru, and Siberia and who struggled to control the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa by means of such society-building strategies as strengthening health services, developing community health workers, and insisting that high-quality caregiving is central to disease control. Their model of partnerships in care with the poor and marginal is based in a deep reading of social theory and the social history of colonial and postcolonial society, as well as extensive experience in the local worlds of the poorest members of society. Global public health practiced this way is a return to the passion for society that gave rise to the social sciences in the first place. The history of social medicine in South Africa in the 1940s and 1950s, which gave rise to early efforts to combine social science and medicine, as well as later developments in medical anthropology, medical history, and medical sociology—all suggest that the health arena may be an especially important social space for the building of social science projects and programs that meet the standard set by social science’s founders. The fields of environmental, educational, and welfare reform provide other salient examples of where social science can build social care.\n\nSocial inquiry was originally taken up as a vital matter with human interests at its heart; and by this standard it made no sense to argue that the study of society should be undertaken for the production of knowledge for its own sake and that its practitioners should operate from a position of moral detachment. In its founding vision, in utter contrast, social inquiry was passionately committed to building knowledge, developing programs, and forging practices in order to make things better for real people facing the devastating effects of real, terrible problems: deep, grinding poverty, forced displacement, homelessness, overcrowding in sordid slums, violent alcohol-jogged lives, vicious workplace conditions, destroyed families, and early disablement and death. The clear interests of the early students of society were to document, to disguise, to improve, to prevent, and to care.\n\nOver time, the professionalization of social inquiry and its institutionalization within the academy took it away from these meliorative and caring interests. Society was transformed from blood, guts, and anguish to an abstracted object of social inquiry. Professional research lost its human edge. It made itself into a science that aspired to the objectivity and reductions of the science of inanimate, unentangled entities. It lost or, in other words, diminished its human interest. Periodically, important figures—Jane Addams, Max Weber, Ferdinand Tönnies, W.H.R. Rivers, Franz Boas and his students, C. Wright Mills, Robert Bellah, Renee Fox, a generation of American medical anthropologists and historians—protested against this development and spoke out on behalf of its originating passion. But until the past few decades, the tide was running in the opposite direction. Today, faced with an ever more pronounced crisis of relevance, social scientists are once again committing themselves to the study of social suffering and social care. Disturbing forces are pushing them to do so. Universities are turning away from humanities and social sciences to an emphasis on applied sciences, engineering, and the possibilities for basic science and technology to contribute to the economy, the environment, and health and health care. And students are voting with their feet as they rush toward preprofessional and business courses that offer better job prospects. The global revolution in information technology has added further pressure with its emphasis on the management of packaged knowledge stripped of its lived context, meaning, and interpretation.\n\nOn the more positive side, a renewed recognition of the potential contributions the social sciences can make to the downside of social change—structured violence, substance abuse, human trafficking, refugee trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, environmental health crises, epidemics of emerging diseases, broken communities, the unintended consequences of policies and programs, the increasing need for elder care—pulls social scientists toward interventions. As the ideology of value-neutral social science gives way to the practical knowledge commitments of social justice, humanitarianism, and social care, new possibilities for theory as well as empirical study are provided. This book tells this story. It seeks to show how deeper and more original knowledge of social suffering is crucial both for understanding where sociology and anthropology have come from and where they may now be headed. In that sense, it is a manifesto for a way of doing social science that the authors regard as liberating and redeeming. This is an approach to the study of society that begins and ends with the question of how to respond to social suffering.\n\nThis book is designed both as a resource for thinking about human social conditions and as a means to promote social science as an ameliorative social practice. It documents the origins and development of social suffering as a public, analytical, and critical concern. It charts the potential for problems of social suffering to awaken social consciousness and for this to inspire the pursuit of social understanding out of a commitment to initiate practical healing and progressive social change in people’s lives. Our writing is informed by the conviction that a great deal of what now passes as social science is in thrall to technocratic procedures and structures of career that leave it critically sterile, cynical, and devoid of passion. By contrast, we aim to promote social inquiry as the enactment of substantive human values and as a moral commitment to building humane forms of society. On our account, it requires the cultivation of a humanitarian social imaginary and a commitment to humanitarian social reform. Our frame of analysis is set out in opposition to the production of social theory as mere academic discourse and against critique as an end in itself. It approaches the task of theoretical thinking with sights set on problem solving, particularly in contexts that bring great harm and damage to human life. Each chapter is designed to equip readers with resources to question the cultural character, operational conditions, and ethical value of social theory and research. By involving readers in many of the intellectual difficulties and moral tensions that are a necessary component of research and writing on social suffering, we aim to disclose the potential for this matter to reform the critical thinking and practice of social science.\n\nThis book can also be read as a further contribution to the development of a care perspective in social science. This notion already holds a great deal of resonance for many concerned with investigating the value placed on care in society and in understanding better the social conditions that make it possible for us to care effectively for others. Here we share in the conviction that while giving and receiving care is essential for our human flourishing as such, all too often this matter is cast to the margins of public debate and political concern. By exposing deficits in the quality of care provided to vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups, moreover, the human costs of contemporary power relationships and social organization in terms of the corporeal and moral experience of suffering are laid bare. We understand research and writing on problems of social suffering to necessarily involve a commitment to understanding how the moral imperative to care for others is met, experienced, and negotiated under real-life conditions and is thereby either left frustrated or provided with a social space to nurture humanity. We are committed to the project of promoting care as a means to positively transform society and conditions of democracy. We would add, however, that we also see this as a fundamental requirement for the invigoration of human-social understanding. We not only argue that the value of social science should be sought in its involvement in the promotion of real acts of care in society, but also that it is through the act of caring for others that we stand to grasp how social life is made possible and sustained, most particularly in terms of what matters for people. We take the provocation of social suffering as a spur toward the alignment of social inquiry with the pedagogy of caregiving.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe owe a great debt of gratitude to many people who have helped in the creation of this book. We are grateful for the grant from the British Academy and support from Harvard’s Michael Crichton Fund that bought us the space and time to start the work. At various points we were encouraged to keep writing by Gillian Bendelow, John Brewer, Keith Hayward, Gabe Mythen, and Chris Shilling in the United Kingdom; by Alan Petersen in Australia; by Ron Anderson, Paul Farmer, Anne Becker, Salmaan Keshavjee, Michael Jackson, Veena Das, João Biehl, Peter Benson, Clara Han, Angela Garcia, Yan Yunxiang, Everett Zhang, Allan Brandt, David Carrasco, Charles Rosenberg, Renée Fox, and David Mechanic in the United States; by Margaret Lock in Canada and New Zealand; and by Jing Jun, Xiao Shuiyuan, Pan Tianshu, Wu Fei, and Guo Jinhua in China.

The argument presented in the book also benefited from discussion when it was presented at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences. We are grateful to David Redmon for access to the documentary and ethnographic materials that informed the writing of the introduction and also for his encouragement. Special thanks are due to Janice Reid and Tim Strangleman, who spent time reading through drafts of chapters and offered valuable critical comments on the form and content of the text. We also wish to thank Annikki Herranen for her editorial work and proofreading. Administrative and research support from Linda Thomas, Marilyn Goodrich, Emily Harrison, Bridget Hanna, Maria Stalford, Andrew McDowell, Lindsay Alexander, and Andrew Ong is also greatly appreciated. There have been many occasions over the past few years when we have been sustained by the love of family, and without this, it is very doubtful we would have found the resolve to keep working through the most difficult times, which included most notably the death of Joan Kleinman, who helped develop the way social suffering is applied in medical anthropology and China studies. We are especially grateful to Janice Reid, Anne Kleinman, Peter Kleinman, Thomas Wong, Kelly Kleinman, Gabriel Wong, Kendall Kleinman, Allegra Wong, Clayton Kleinman, Laura Sloate, Marcia Kleinman, Anna Taylor, and Felix Wilkinson for their love, care, and understanding.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe girl cannot spare the time to break away from her work. With urgent dexterity she carries on preparing the machine for melting and blending polystyrene with polyethylene to produce another string of plastic beads as she explains:\n\nWe work for such a long time every day, but we only get a little salary . . . too little. It’s incredibly little. Take me as an example. The most I’ve made this year is 500 yuan ($62) per month and not yet 600 yuan ($75). . . . Because I have come to earth I have to make a living. There are different ways to make a living. Those of us who are not well educated and don’t have a good family background have no choice but to work and support ourselves. . . . When I was studying at school I dreamed of becoming an outstanding actress. But this dream will never be realized. . . . [Now I think] about how to help my parents financially and support my younger brother although I cannot realize my dreams. I still have hope in my brother. I believe he can achieve his dreams. I put all my hopes and dreams on my brother. . . . He’s studying in school now. He’s 12 almost 13. I suppose he has just entered middle school. . . . It’s because we are poor. If I go to school, then my brother cannot go to school. Only one of us can go to school. . . . Unfairness is irrelevant. I am willing to sacrifice for my brother.¹\n\nAnxious to avoid the punishment of having her pay docked for not producing her daily quota of beads, she returns to her work. The air is heavy with acrid fumes from melted polystyrene, fumes that when inhaled are known to cause cancer and that also contain chemicals linked to hormonal disruptions and birth defects.² The temperature inside the factory is close to 40°C. All around her there is frenzied activity as her fellow laborers work as fast as they can to paint, polish, and solder strings of beads for export to the New Orleans Mardi Gras Carnival, where in a glut of hedonistic excess they will be traded between revelers in exchanges for kisses and sexual acts. Those riding high on the thrill of Carnival will know nothing of the many wasted lives³ invested in the production of the pounds of glittering beads hanging round their necks—all soon to be discarded as cheap trash, flung to the street gutters for refuse collection destined for a toxic landfill.\n\nThe vast majority of the Chinese factory laborers are girls between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. They work with heads bowed in intense concentration. There is no time to waste on talk; and aside from this, talk risks further punishment of a cut in pay. Their hands are permanently stained from handling various chemicals, dyes, and paints. Many are swollen and scarred from the cuts, burns, and pin prick wounds accumulated through each working day, a day that lasts on average fourteen hours and can rise to eighteen hours through the busiest times of the year. Between shifts the girls live, eat, and sleep in the factory compound fenced off from the outside world by high walls topped with lines of barbed wire in dorms where beds are shared one between two. They only leave the compound on their day off, which, so long as they are not required to work overtime to meet the deadline for an order from America, comes once every two weeks.\n\nThe Tai Kuen Bead Factory is located in the special economic zone of Fuzhou in the province of Fujian in Southeast China. Here state capitalism operates at full throttle, and nothing—least of all any concerns raised over the health, safety, and welfare of migrant laborers—is permitted to obstruct the frenetic pace at which consumer durables are manufactured for export around the globe. Such zones are the powerhouses of the Chinese economy and are the destination sought by many of the floating (liudon renkou) rural migrant workers now caught up in the greatest internal migration in human history.⁴ In their desperate attempts to escape rural poverty, these people are prepared to risk a marginal existence outside the national hukou household registration system.⁵ This requires them to endure brutal working and housing conditions beyond the reach of state social security and excluded from work safety legislation and basic health care provision. More often than not they are made to live and work in hazardous environments where a combination of exhausting toil, pollution, unsanitary conditions, and poor nutrition make them particularly vulnerable to life-threatening disease.⁶ The numbers of desperate floating people seeking work far exceeds the supply of jobs. Under these circumstances they inevitably find that as individual human beings they are treated by those in positions of power and authority as readily expendable if not little more than superfluous.⁷\n\nThis is a context of social suffering. Here the day-to-day experience of life is socially configured to involve large numbers of people in considerable and often excessive amounts of physical discomfort and emotional distress. Social life is met and made in pronounced states of anguish and through grinding misery. People’s living and working conditions are embodied in chronic fatigue, ritualized humiliations, and social shame. The high incidence of depressive symptoms and bodily disease among these populations serves as documentary evidence for social conditions that deliver harm to large numbers of people.⁸ The situations in the textile industry in Bangladesh, in the mines of Burma and Congo, in the houses of Mumbai’s slum dwellers where piecework is done night and day, in the garbage collecting in the northeastern Brazilian favelas, and in the brothels of Cambodia and Lagos are the same if not worse: upending lives, breaking bodies, and vexing minds. Add violence to this destructive mix, because it is common in many places, and the resulting picture is brutal, cruel, and inhuman.\n\nSuch conditions are a key concern in this book. This places the problem of social suffering at the center of the attempt to unmask the moral character of human societies. Social suffering is a critical issue that brings moral debate to the human costs exacted by our social arrangements, economic organization, cultural values, and modes of governance. The documentation and analysis of this experience is taken up as a necessary part of the pursuit of social justice and as a vital matter for any who would see care for the human as a social priority.\n\nThis also draws the conduct and purpose of social science into debate. Here our interest lies not only in the capacity of social research to reveal how social suffering takes place and what it does to people but also with the manner of its contribution to the cultivation of bonds of social recognition and in its potential to inspire real acts of care. We are committed to exploring how social theory and research might operate in the service of social care and as a component of humanitarian endeavor. We contend, moreover, that it is through our participation in caregiving and by our involvement in humanitarian action, however difficult, frustrated, and compromised, that it is possible to attain a better grasp of what is socially at stake for people in the contexts in which they are made to live. The practice of care for others we take to be a necessary part of the pursuit of understanding of how social life takes place through enactments of substantive human values. Coming to terms with society means making sense of social suffering, and that in turn enjoins us to act in the social world on behalf of human lives.\n\nThis is another reason that we have featured the experience of a young woman working in the Tai Kuen Bead Factory as a means to introduce our text. It is drawn from a study that attempts to advance a new approach to documenting social life on a global scale by methods of visual ethnography. In his documentary film Mardi Gras: Made in China, David Redmon works not only to draw social attention to a chain of global relationships in the production, consumption, and disposal of Mardi Gras beads but also to provide us with an encounter with this as a matter of sensual life. At one level his film is a study of how the sensual life of the beads, both in their manufacture and in their exchange, bind strangers across continents in a dense web of associations and interpersonal relations, many of which are exploitative, morally troubling, and destructive of human values. At another level, in addition to providing us with information on what is being done by and to people in these contexts, his aim is to have us affected by the human drama of social life. At the same time that we are invited to join with him in the shocking discovery of social arrangements that are designed to divest individuals of their humanity on one side of the globe so as to fuel the bacchanalia of consumption on the other, we are presented with material to enable us to feel for what is happening to people. Redmon’s film is designed both to cultivate the sociological imagination and to provide a viscerally charged encounter with the brute facts of social life as moral experience in order to provoke in us a response to act to critique, unmake, and remake life.\n\nThis book further explores the role played by humanitarian feeling in the acquisition and development of our social understanding. We approach films such as Mardi Gras: Made in China, as well as many other sentiment-fired documents of social life, as representative of a long-standing tradition of social inquiry that aims to advance social consciousness by having us feel for people in their day-to-day challenges, perplexities, and struggles. We investigate the forms of inquiry, documentation, and methodology that are suited to make known conditions of social suffering. We set these within a history of critical debate over the category of the social as a component of human experience and as an object of science, with an aim to question the moral values incorporated in favored terms of social understanding, especially where these are accorded a privileged place in the production of authoritative knowledge of social life. Our plan is to provoke debate over the human value of social science, and, further, over how it might be best equipped to advance care for the human as its prime concern.\n\nWe could have emphasized man-made and natural catastrophes, wars, epidemics, and other extraordinary forms of human misery. But instead we seek to privilege the ordinary, everyday forms of structural violence, because this is what social life is like for many people in the world who are poor and desperate, every day.\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF SUFFERING\n\nIn modern times, the problem of suffering has acquired an unprecedented capacity to confound our moral sensibilities and powers of reason. There are many occasions when it seems that the brute force of human affliction reduces the meaning of life to a worthless absurdity. Suffering is encountered not only as an assault upon our sensibilities and social understanding but also in forms and at intensities that exceed our powers of cultural representation and collective sensibility. The potential for the experience of suffering to bring us into painful confrontation with the cultural deficits of modernity and our inability to reconcile aspirations of social justice with global inequality and its profoundly human toll feature as a major provocation to philosophical and theological debate and as a principal theme of our narrative fiction.⁹ The problem of suffering resides not so much in the lack of symbolic resources to give formal expression to our experience, but rather in the burden of the conviction that, in struggling to make known the human values at stake in the event of suffering, our efforts are always set to end in failure.¹⁰ There is no form of culture that appears adequate to the task. Human suffering has inspired some of our most celebrated works of art, music, and literature. Yet more often than not it is the difficulty of understanding what suffering does to people and the torments borne through this perplexity on account of the sheer burden of experience that are featured. Our presiding concerns are how to understand and what to do.\n\nHow should we relate to a social world in which there is, quite plainly, far too much suffering? For example, how should we venture to account for the experience of the many millions of people whose lives have been, and continue to be, ravaged and drastically cut short by starvation and diseases of poverty? How should we depict the condition and fate of vast populations immersed in a constant struggle for physical survival? What form of language is suited to convey the violence that is done to more than a billion people who are born into the rapidly expanding slum districts of the megacities of the developing world and who are largely abandoned to work at surviving in diseased environments overflowing with industrial detritus and foul human waste?¹¹ How do we represent the losses and ungrounded lives of the world’s 50 million refugees? And how do we use the language and understanding we do possess in order to respond?\n\nHow should we, moreover, venture to understand the great forces of destruction that have been unleashed upon the world through modern warfare and the scale of the human horror inflicted upon populations by powerful states intent on their annihilation? What kind of narrative script is adequate to capture the moral meaning of the many atrocities of war visited upon people in the mass slaughter of the Somme, the ruthless ferocity of Operation Barbarossa, the 20 million killed and 250 million displaced by Japan’s war on the Chinese people, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the napalming of villages in Cambodia and Vietnam or the consequences of the destruction of Iraq?¹² Can anything in our culture serve to adequately account for the harm that is done to people made victims of the Shoah and other genocides or the trauma that is visited upon generations thereafter burdened by the knowledge of how the lives of those they love have been treated as no more than a superfluous irrelevance? Mass violence forces us to confront past horror and present brutality as the persistent cruelty of the social.¹³ What can be our response to such structural ferocity, such regular savagery? And doesn’t that response also need to account for how memories of social suffering can fuel acts of vengeance, create vicious cycles of violence, and ruin lives of those unable to master histories of trauma?\n\nWhen confronting these agonizing questions, some are inclined to take agony itself as a key to understanding how such extremes of suffering are borne within our culture. For example, Emmanuel Levinas advises that there may well be an essential part of the experience of human suffering that imposes itself on consciousness, yet must always remain somehow unacceptable to consciousness. He holds, Taken as an experience the denial and refusal of meaning which is imposed as a sensible quality is the way in which the unbearable is precisely borne by consciousness, the way this not-being-borne is, paradoxically, a sensation or a given.¹⁴ Levinas argues that it may well be by attending to the experience of failing to bestow sufficient meaning on suffering that we stand to gather some insight into the torment by which it is constituted in experience.\n\nIn a similar vein, others argue that we should approach suffering as a phenomenon that we literally cannot come to grips with and, further, hold that in acknowledging what suffering does to a person we should not flinch from declaring it unspeakable.¹⁵ Indeed, such a stance finds support from George Steiner when he argues that as a matter of ethical propriety we should stand opposed to the attempt to render extreme forms of human suffering amenable to representation in language, for words are always bound to trivialize such experiences to a point that is morally objectionable.¹⁶\n\nA contrasting view holds that it is often through the adoption of an attitude of silence that we mystify something we dare not understand.¹⁷ On this account, the witness of silence is portrayed not so much as a form of empathy or moral understanding but rather as a device by which people work to remove themselves from the tensions borne in the face of the suffering of others.¹⁸ It is argued that when struck by the difficulty of understanding what suffering does to people, our quiescence serves as a means to relinquish the effort to make sense of the brute facts of their situation. This is not only recognized as a matter of intellectual bad faith but also and more worryingly as a stance that some in positions of power and authority use to suppress wider questions of social justice and responsibility. Here many share in Hannah Arendt’s concern to expose the capacity for official double-talk to silence the authentic voice of human affliction, and in this context it is claimed that it is likely that silence degrades the moral status of human suffering to a point where it can be treated as no more than a meaningless triviality.¹⁹"
