        "text": "South Yorkshire Times – Saturday 09 May 1942\n\nNews from India\n\nMr. and Mrs. A. Wilkinson, of 47, Sandygate, Wath, have received a letter from a former Wombwell woman, Mrs. E. V. Parkinson (daughter of Mr. Edward Oakland, Park Hill Brickworks) now living in India, informing them that their son, C P Benjamin Arthur Wilkinson (21) RA., is fit and well.\n\nMrs. Parkinson says the British women in India assemble at the stations to meet troop trains, cheer the boys and distribute cigarettes, fruit and sweets, and take the address of their nearest relative so that they can write to their relatives.\n\nCpl. Wilkinson was called up at the outbreak of war and was drafted to India last year."
