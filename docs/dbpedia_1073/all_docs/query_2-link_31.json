        "text": "Welcome!\n\nThe Lawrenceville experience is more than 210 years in the making, and core to that heritage is the value we place on our close, caring community. Young people encounter rigorous challenges in a highly supportive environment, and with this careful preparation, year after year, our graduates head out into the world with the confidence to thrive and the conviction to make a difference.\n\nThe moment you walk on campus, you’ll start to get a feel. That feeling goes beyond the beautiful nineteenth century Houses and academic buildings on The Circle that evoke tradition. It is deeper than the creative spirit that you will see in our arts facilities. It is far more than the competitive edge you will recognize as you walk our playing fields, where our teams play hard, play fair, and play to win. You will be struck above all by the warmth of the people.\n\nAt the heart of this great school is the belief that our students dig deeper, reach higher, and stretch further when they feel the embrace of supportive peers and the mentorship of caring adults who know when and how to challenge them. That’s the Lawrenceville difference. This sense of community is fostered by the close-knit House system where young Lawrentians develop a deep sense of belonging; it is forged around the inspiring Harkness table, where teachers engage student intellect, encourage them to grapple with ideas, and teach lifelong respect and humility.\n\nSo let us welcome you to campus, walk the pathways with us, and get to know the warmth and strength of our community first hand. That feeling is real — that’s Lawrenceville!"
