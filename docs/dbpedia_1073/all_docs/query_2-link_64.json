Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas officiated the ceremony, where 268 employees received a Secretary’s Award in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the mission.\n\n“Every day, the men and women of the Department respond to cyberattacks; save lives by sea and air; secure our nation’s borders and critical infrastructure; and deploy across the country to help Americans recover from disasters; and so much more. Their achievements aren’t only on the front lines, but also extend behind the scenes to modernize and streamline the Department’s processes in order to better relationships between the Department and the people we serve,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “It is the honor of my life to lead this Department and to recognize some of the extraordinary public servants who safeguard our nation and keep us all safe.”\n\nThe DHS Secretary’s Awards are an annual program that recognizes the extraordinary individual and collective achievements of the workforce. This year’s award recipients improved the efficiency of processing noncitizens at the Southwest Border, deployed across the country to respond to natural disasters, investigated cybercrime, created a new streamlined process for adjudicating asylum applications, safely and securely resettled nearly 100,000 evacuated Afghans in the United States, provided resources for organizations to enhance their cybersecurity resilience, established a process for Ukrainian nationals seeking refuge, secured the 2022 midterm elections, and demonstrated heroism by acting quickly and courageously to save lives in harrowing circumstances.\n\nThis year, DHS held ceremonies across the country, honoring over 1,300 employees.

I was also able to contribute to the expansion of housing options not only for disaster survivors, but a potentially national adoption of accessible recreation vehicles. Working at DHS is very rewarding, and in this career I am able to directly effect a person’s recovery in a positive and respectful manner.”\n\nThe 268 employees presented with awards at this ceremony for excellence and heroic actions include:\n\nSecretary’s Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award\n\nIntelligence and Analysis Russia-Ukraine Crisis Response Team: The TSA Intelligence and Analysis office's Russia-Ukraine Crisis Response Team’s efforts ensured that senior leadership, remained well-informed about all aspects of the rapidly evolving crisis, including political, military, diplomatic, humanitarian, and cyber implications.
