        "text": "On 6 May King Charles III will be crowned at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony that has its origins dating back a thousand years to King Edgar the Peaceful. It will also be the first coronation in nearly 70 years and much like his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation which was the first to be televised, Charles III’s coronation will be the first to utilise both social media and YouTube as well as traditional communication channels.\n\nSince the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the ascension of King Charles III to the throne, there has been a lot of speculation about what his coronation will be like; ranging from the sensible for instance, what sort of coronation will it be owing to the current economic climate? to the ridiculous and fanciful such as what tiaras will be worn. It has also not been helped either by the continuing drama surrounding Prince Harry and his wife Meghan – will they attend the coronation or not? Only time will tell if they do turn up or not.\n\nFrom initial press reports (many of which should be taken with a pinch of salt anyway), the coronation will be markedly shorter, the ceremony will be around an hour and a half compared to 4 to 5 hours in 1953. Due to costs, the Coronation Review of the Fleet has been scrapped and Queen Camilla has returned to the pre-1831 practice of using a previous consort’s crown instead of having a new one made. There’s also the acknowledgement that the Britain of 2023 is very different from 1953, as politicians and peers have reportedly been told that they will not be guaranteed invitations.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the coronation is not a ceremony that is unchanging or set in stone. True, there are some elements such as the recognition and anointing that remain more or less the same but certain parts of the ceremony have been altered or removed to fit the changing times and make concessions to economic realities. Any cost cutting has its historical precedent – for instance when William IV did away with certain practices such as the coronation banquet, the King’s Champion making an appearance in full medieval armour and axing the position of herb strewers – ladies who proceeded the Sovereign’s route inside the Abbey by strewing sweet smelling herbs and floral petals.\n\nChanges to the coronation ceremony have also been made especially in the last century, as there is the acknowledgement that the main role of the Monarchy is to act as a unifying force and that the coronation is for the people regardless of status, colour & creed, not only for the aristocracy and members of the Established Church.\n\nIn the run up to the event on 6 May, we shall be looking at three of the coronations that took place in the last century, how they have changed, how they have left their mark for the 1953 ritual and how they can influence the upcoming ceremony.\n\nKING EDWARD VII AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA:\n\nWhen the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra was scheduled for 26 June 1902, there was a general state of speculation about what the coronation would be like since the last one took place in 1838 and hardly anyone who witnessed it was still around by 1902.\n\nThe new king (unlike his mother) loved ceremony and pomp. Anna Keay observed that, “he loved the theatre and had a strong sense of both drama and romance.” This love of theatre was corollary to Edward’s strong sense of the importance of the visibility of the monarch and the royal family to the public. As he remonstrated with Queen Victoria, “the more people see the Sovereign, the better it is for the country.” As king, he revived much of the pomp and ceremony abandoned by Victoria after Prince Albert’s death and his renovation of Buckingham Palace was to reassert its status as the centre of the monarchy and to fulfil its main function of welcoming and entertaining guests from all over the country, the Empire, and the world.\n\nDespite King Edward VII’s love of pageantry, he felt that many aspects of the ascension and coronation ceremonies were out step with the times. He objected to the anti-Catholic wording in the ascension oath and when told that it would not be possible to change it, got his own back by mumbling through the words: thereby signifying his disapproval of the continued prejudice against many of his subjects and his desire to be a “king of all the people.” For the coronation however, he was persuaded by the courtier Reginald Brett, Viscount Esher that its “ancientness was precisely what gave the occasion its solemn majesty, and that he should retain, even enhance ‘all the ancient practices and traditions,’ omitting only those that were actually ‘ridiculous.’”\n\nIn the run up to the coronation, Edward VII was not feeling well, and doctors diagnosed an abscessed appendix. He was persuaded to undergo an operation, but the king refused, telling his doctor Sir Francis Laking, “the Coronation cannot be postponed. I won’t hear of it. I cannot and will not disappoint the people…..I will go to the Abbey on Thursday if I die there.” To which the doctor replied, “If Your Majesty did go on Thursday to the Abbey in all human probability you would die there.” In the end the king reluctantly gave way, the coronation was postponed to a later date, and the operation was performed in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace.\n\nDespite the postponement, Edward VII insisted that regional celebrations and the planned Coronation dinner for London’s poor should go ahead. He and Queen Alexandra paid for the festivities and meals out of their own pockets while businesses and wealthy friends such as Sir Thomas Lipton also contributed. The dinner was bolstered by food prepared for the postponed banquet which the king ordered should be given to the poor to avoid waste. One wonders what the poor of London made of the amounts of lobster and other rich foodstuffs they were served together with the regular fare of roast beef, potatoes, and ale.\n\nThe coronation was finally held on 9 August and as most of the representatives from other countries had left London due to the postponement, the ceremony had more of a domestic and Empire wide flavour as various African chiefs, Indian princes & sultans from Malaya joined the Dominion prime ministers in Westminster Abbey. Despite the postponement, Edward VII still felt weak, and parts of the ceremony had to be shortened further to avoid any strain and fatigue. Much to his disappointment, the king was crowned with the lighter Imperial State Crown rather than the St Edward’s Crown which was heavier. Ironically, Edward VII would have the opportunity to wear his namesake’s crown when it was placed atop his coffin in 1910.\n\nDespite the solemnity of the occasion, Edward VII saw the lighter side of things. As he and Queen Alexandra made their way down the stairs at Buckingham Palace, he saw his grandchildren looking at awe in him. He approached them with a smile and asked, “Good morning, children. Am I not a funny looking old man?” At his insistence, a special section of the Abbey was allocated for his special lady friends and previous and current mistresses which the wags described as “The King’s Loose Box.”\n\nThe actual ceremony went smoothly despite a few mishaps, as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple refused to delegate some of his duties despite his great age and infirmities. Throughout the ceremony, Temple had to be supported by two other bishops as he was struggling with his legs and during the actual crowning, his hands were shaking so badly that he placed the crown the wrong way round on Edward’s head and the king had to discreetly turn it around the right way. Temple’s eyesight was also so bad that he had to read the service from large scrolls written in large print.\n\nWhen the time came for the peers to perform their homage, it was George Prince of Wales who went first and observers noted that as George rose, his father pulled him closer to him and kissed him on both cheeks, a sign of the affection the king held for his only surviving son.\n\nAs for Queen Alexandra, the question was regarding her role in the ceremony and what she would be wearing as the last Queen Consort to be crowned was Queen Adelaide in 1831 and hardly anyone who witnessed that event was still alive to recall it. While courtiers scrambled to find records of previous coronations to ascertain what role the new consort would play, Queen Alexandra was seemingly unconcerned with precedent especially with regards to dress. Which was unsurprising as ever since the Danish-born queen came to Britain to marry the future Edward VII in 1863, Alexandra had been known for her beauty and style – other women copied what she wore and for the coronation, the new queen had a clear idea of what she wanted, “I know better than all the milliners and antiquaries. I shall wear exactly what I like and so will all my ladies – basta!”\n\nAlexandra was in her way a rule breaker and unlike her mother-in-law Queen Victoria and her daughter-in-law, Queen Mary she didn’t exclusively patronise British designers and stores for her clothes. For the coronation Morin Blossier, a Parisian dressmaker, made Alexandra’s gown from fabric produced in India and designed by the vicereine of India, Lady Curzon. The gown was two pieces made up of a boned bodice and a long skirt, from a cloth of gold and over it a net of Indian embroidery containing the motifs of the British Isles and the Empire. Completing the gown were long hanging sleeves and a standing collar that was trimmed with gold lace. The only part of her coronation ensemble that was British made was her robe of state made by Marshall and Snelgrove but instead of the traditional violet and crimson, it was in petunia purple. The robe was carried by eight pages of honour instead of the traditional maids of honour. Unlike the maids of honour who were the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls, Alexandra’s pages were drawn from all ranks of the aristocracy and gentry.\n\nFor her crown, Alexandra decided against the traditional four full arches and decided to have eight half arches as a nod to her homeland, Denmark. Denmark was also reflected in one of the pieces of jewellery she wore – a replica of the Dagmar Cross which was given to her by her uncle Frederick VII on her wedding day. On her crown as well was the Koh-i-Noor diamond which later adorned the crowns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth in 1911 and 1937 respectively. However, there is an intriguing mystery about the many of the stones in Queen Alexandra’s crown; we know that the Koh-i-Noor was removed and replaced with a crystal version but the way the other stones were placed would have made it difficult for jewellers to prise them out without damaging the frame. Suzy Menkes who closely examined the crown now held at the Tower of London mused:\n\nCan it be that Queen Alexandra (“I shall wear exactly what I like…..Basta!”) chose to be crowned with a lightweight more comfortable crown rather than to have her head weighed down with real stones? Did the splendid, stately Queen Alexandra, a vision of Majesty in her maharajah’s ransom of jewellery, became Queen of England before God and her King in a crown of paste? (p. 49)\n\nPerhaps Menkes has a point here as it wasn’t only comfort that Queen Alexandra seemed to be after during the Coronation but also a mix of religious belief and vanity. Due to Temple’s frailty, it was decided that the Archbishop of York, William Maclagan would preside over the crowning of the queen. Prior to the ceremony, Alexandra had a meeting with Maclagan to go over the ceremony and was anxious with regards to the anointing. Traditionally, the oil would be poured on the head but as the queen would be wearing a toupee to conceal her thinning hair, she was worried that the liquid would damage the hairpiece. Maclagan solved the problem by anointing Alexandra over the forehead and according to Consuelo Duchess of Marlborough, one of the canopy bearers, the queen didn’t flinch when the oil trickled from her forehead down her nose.\n\nWhen Alexandra was finally crowned, it was the cue for the 400 peeresses in the congregation to put on their coronets and since they were also wearing tiaras, they had to arch their hands high to put them on. The sight of 400 white gloved hands high in the air in an almost balletic fashion was one of the highlights of the ceremony; as it was when following the short ceremony, Queen Alexandra wearing her crown and carrying both the consort’s sceptre and ivory rod, dropped a deep bow as she passed her husband the king. As Jane Ridley observed, “[Alexandra] was fifty-six, heavily made up, allegedly bald and almost stone deaf, but she seemed like a queen from a fairy-tale.”\n\nLEGACY:\n\nThe 1902 coronation would set many of the templates that would be followed in subsequent coronations. On Edward VII’s orders, the coachman’s box in the Gold State Coach was removed and the carriage was driven by postillion riders to enable the crowds to get a good view of him and the queen as they drove past. The box was never returned and since then, the coach has always been driven postillion style.\n\nA new state landau was also built for a post-coronation drive down the East End of London and its large body was built to accommodate the king’s rotund frame. This carriage has been widely used since then for various state and ceremonial occasions.\n\nEdward VII’s coronation also saw the first large scale participation by soldiers from the Empire and Dominions which again would be a defining feature in subsequent coronations.\n\nHowever, the biggest legacy of the 1902 coronation was in music. Sir Frederick Bridge, the man in charge of the music for the coronation, decided to use music from the great English composers of the 16th and 17th centuries – Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell as well as those from the 19th century such as Sir Arthur Sullivan. There were also new commissions from contemporary British composers such as Sir Walter Parratt and Sir Hubert Parry. The latter has had the most impact on the ceremony as his version of “I Was Glad” together with the traditional “vivats” as performed by the King’s Scholars of Westminster School has been used in subsequent coronations.\n\nAn even bigger impact was Edward Elgar’s music. Although he was not commissioned to contribute to the music during the actual coronation service, he composed the Coronation Ode with words provided by the poet, essayist, and academic A.B. Benson. It was commissioned for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House on 31 June 1902 which was subsequently cancelled because of the postponement. The ode eventually had its debut performances at Sheffield and Bristol where it was well received. As Jeffrey Richards wrote:\n\nThe Coronation Ode of 1902 is ceremonial music of the first rank, the lyricism and splendour animated by genuine emotion and belief….[i]t is a celebration of monarchy and a hymn of hope to all the virtues and qualities that were expected of the new reign – peace, prosperity, freedom. (p. 63)\n\nThe sixth movement of the ode has now lived on as “Land of Hope and Glory” as Benson modified the original lyrics which included the famous chorus that has remained sung to this day at sports events and the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nDavid Duff.

Music and Monarchy, BBC documentary, first telecast on BBC 2, 2013\n\nThe last time Britain saw a coronation was in 1953 and to this day this country remains one of two in Europe (the other being the Vatican) where the head of state is enthroned in a centuries-old ritual steeped in religion and tradition. The build-up leading to and what happened on 2 June 1953 has been told and re-told several times and this documentary could have been like previous ones but this has a unique twist.\n\nTwo in fact. For arguably the first time, the Crown Jewels and regalia were filmed in close range and using high definition cameras which meant that viewers could see the detail and workmanship of each crown and regalia featured. Secondly and more importantly, the viewers have Her Majesty the Queen as their guide. Watching both official and home footage, the Queen shared her memories of the event and whilst she has not seen the footage from her own coronation for 65 years, she recalled that it was “a very long day. When you’re taking part in something you don’t see it.”\n\nThis was a far cry from the coronation of her father George VI in 1937 where despite it being held over 70 years ago, she can still remember how it all unfolded: as she cheerfully admits that she didn’t have a role in the ceremony, she was only present to sit and watch. George VI wanted his daughter to be prepared when her time came and insisted that she write down her memories of the big day and the result now resides in the Royal Archives – an impression of a sacred ceremony through the eyes of an 11 year old.\n\nThe Queen’s coronation is significant as it was the first to be televised and aware that more people would be watching the ceremony than in any previous coronations, the stakes were high – no mistakes on the same scale as those that plagued Victoria or George VI’s coronation were to be allowed. Sixteen months were given in order to prepare and rehearse for the ceremony itself, and Lady Anne Coke (now Lady Glenconner) who served as one of the six maids of honour and James Wilkinson, one of the 400 choir singers who took part, were on hand to share their memories of the build up to and during the big day.\n\nJuxtaposed too with the footage of the actual event was the Queen talking through two of the most important pieces of the regalia – the two crowns she wore for the ceremony. For the first time in 65 years Her Majesty was reunited with the St Edward’s Crown which weighs five pounds and was made in 1661 for the coronation of Charles II. “Is it still as heavy?” she wondered as the crown was placed in front of her. “Yes, it is,” she nods picking up the crown. “It weighs a ton!” The documentary mentioned a little-known fact about this crown – only the sovereign, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Crown Jeweller are permitted to touch it.\n\nMore manageable was the Imperial State Crown which weighs around three pounds but as the Queen herself observed she has to be careful while wearing it especially during the State Opening of Parliament while she’s reading her speech: “You can’t look down in it, though, or your neck would break. And it would fall off.” While the Imperial State Crown might be the newer of the two crowns, it is studded with historic gems from the Black Prince’s Ruby (actually a spinel) reportedly worn by Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt to the sapphire from the ring of Edward the Confessor and the pearls that belonged to Mary Queen of Scots and which were purchased by her cousin Elizabeth I. The latter’s namesake mused as she held the dangling gems in the palm of her hand: “Pearls are sort of living things. They need warming up and these have just been hanging here. Quite sad, really.”\n\nDiscomfort was also the order of the day. Not only did Her Majesty have to contend with two heavy crowns and sit through a five hour ceremony, even her mode of transport was uncomfortable as well. The Gold State Coach made in 1760 for George III had been used for every coronation since 1821 and despite its magnificent appearance never endeared itself to the monarchs who have had to ride in it. Victoria was not a great fan of its “distressing oscillations” and William IV himself despite having spent much of his life in the Navy described riding the carriage as like being tossed about a rough sea. Count the present Queen then as also not a fan as she told Alastair Bruce: “Horrible! It’s not designed for travelling in at all. It’s only sprung on leather, you know.”\n\nWhile the focus of the programme was the Queen, the regalia took centre stage as well. In the capable hands of narrator Keeley Hawes and former Historic Royal Palaces curator Anna Keay, the commentary was informative and concise as they took the viewer through the history and significance of the regalia and the ceremony itself, with a few significant anecdotes along the way – such as how the Cullinan diamond was sent to Britain (via ordinary mail) to the Crown Jewels being hidden during the Second World War. The Queen mused about how lucky it was that the one person who knew where they were hidden didn’t die before the war was over and the jewels could be retrieved.\n\nHowever the weak link in the documentary was Alastair Bruce, he’s described as an expert on royal ceremony but he added nothing new or insightful about the ceremony or the regalia and his conversation with the Queen sometimes bordered on the fawning. But that’s one quibble; the real star of this documentary was the Queen herself – smiling, giggling, looking in awe at her younger self and as sharp as ever. For Her Majesty alone, watching this was a privilege and worth it!\n\nThe Coronation with Her Majesty the Queen was telecast on BBC1 on 14 January 2018"
