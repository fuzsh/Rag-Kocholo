        "text": "Allan Herbie Jones’ playing and conducting career has been temporarily cut short lately through illness which has resulted in him having more time for writing and arranging. In the past he tried the professional musician route, playing trumpet in numerous orchestras and dance bands and conducting small orchestras and wind ensembles. He then retrained and taught IT at higher level, still playing and conducting part time.\n\nBeing self taught, his love of composing and arranging tunes for all types of instruments has brought him great pleasure and he intends to keep on writing whenever he gets the inspiration.\n\nHis main objective is to try and inspire wind players that quality sound comes from producing quality air, and that takes quality practice.\n\nHis compositions are mostly based on a simple tune. Sometimes decorated and sometimes plain. He hopes you enjoy playing them.\n\nAnthony Whittaker is a British composer. He graduated with a BMus(hons) from the University of London and has an MMus and PhD from the University of Liverpool.\n\nComposition was an interest during his early musical development, and it became increasingly important during the 1990s where he composed for staff and students at the Performing Arts department of Liverpool Community College. Anthony studied composition as a postgraduate at the University of Liverpool with James Wishart and the American composer, Ben Hackbarth.\n\nNotoriety first came in 2000 with the Society for the Promotion of New Music’s performance of Drift for six pianos which was performed alongside Steve Reich’s Music for Six Pianos; the principal pianist being Joanna MacGregor. Choral music became important after this time with Agnus Dei, for male voices received performances in Berlin and Montreal. A Litany, also for male voices, was performed at the International Eisteddfod, Wales and broadcast on S4C television. Larger commissions followed. For example, The Prodigal Son for choir, two pianos and percussion. His choral music has also been performed at the Royal Festival Hall.\n\nChamber music has also played an important part. There are two works for string quartet and Indiscretions with Sarabande was written for the Baroque ensemble L’indiscret in 2007. The Clarinet Quintet was completed in 2009 during a period working in Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nApostolos Loufopoulos studied music at the Ionian University, Greece (Music Degree) and at City University, London (PhD in Music). He creates electroacoustic music and sound art for digital media. His music has been performed internationally in renown festivals of contemporary music (such as ICMC, Synthese, L’Espace Du Son and others) and has received a number of awards at international competitions such as Αrs Electronica (Austria), Bourges (France), Noroit (France), Metamorphoses (Belgium), Space of Sound (Belgium), Franco Evangelisti (Italy), Musica Nova (Czech Republic). He is a founding member of HELMCA (Greek Union of Composers of Electroacoustic Music, www.essim.gr) and the Greek Society for Acoustic Ecology. Also a member of Sonic Arts Network and Project itinerant. He is assistant professor at the Ionian Univ. (Dep. A.V.A).http://apostolosloufopoulos.wordpress.com/ http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/apostolosloufopoulos.\n\nMyrto Korkokiou and Apostolos Loufopoulos have been collaborating since 2000 in composing and performing widely works for flute and electronic sounds, computer processed and prerecorded in real time and diffusion. Her main interest in music involves improvisation and performance with electronics means, as well as composition for flute and electronics. In their works the main target is to create sound environments, life like or imaginary, where the flute is the center of the sound action. The flute with the use of modern flute techniques creates a variety of timbres, which extend and enrich its sound spectrum when combined with electronic sounds either pre-recorded, or processed in real-time.

In Devon, Ed was a member of an early music group and a folk/ceilidh band. On moving to Bristol he used this experience to set up school folk bands, using some of his written arrangements of traditional dance music.\n\nAfter retiring from teaching, Ed moved back to Cumberland, the county of his birth, where he started researching old music manuscripts. He found a great deal of interesting, unpublished material in the tunebooks of 18th and 19th century fiddle players and a wealth of old songs long-forgotten in the county (except by a few aficionados). Initially, he created arrangements, for solo guitar then guitar and harp (after forming a duo with former orchestral harpist Jean Altshuler). These initial arrangements of old Cumbrian music were an attempt to recreate something akin to the original performance style of the music. Latterly, he has taken the view that the old melodies can be developed into new music and set into a new context. He has arranged many of the songs of Susanna Blamire (1747 – 1794) and Robert Anderson (1770 – 1833) and created new compositions inspired by the Cumbrian landscape and the stories of its people.\n\nHe has produced three CDs of Cumbrian music.\n\nMusic of Cumberland and Westmorland – solo guitar arrangements of old Cumbrian tunes, performed by Ed Heslam.\n\nHunsup Through the Wood – original music and arrangements of old Cumbrian tunes, performed by Ed Heslam (guitar) and Jean Altshuler (harp).\n\nBleckell Murry Neet – original music and arrangements of old Cumbrian tunes, performed by Ed Heslam and Jean Altshuler\n\nErnest Tomlinson 1924 – 2015.

Since 1994 he has developed vocal sound therapy courses, resulting in the publication of two books: The Healing Power of the Human Voice and Seed Sounds for Tuning the Chakras. His website is http://www.jamesdangelomusic.com/\n\nJames was born in 1993 in Rotherham and began developing an interest in music from an early age, primarily through the influence of watching his Grandfather’s performances as first clarinet in the Chesterfield Symphony Orchestra. Initially taking lessons on the trumpet, followed by the euphonium in secondary school, James taught himself bass guitar, guitar, drums and piano in his teenage years, attaining grade 8 (merit) on the electric bass aged 18. He began composing contemporary pop and rock pieces in secondary school, expanding his repertoire to jazz band by composing a piece for the “Music for Youth” competition in his final year of school education, which reached the national finals in Birmingham, being praised for its harmonic relationships and orchestration.\n\nJames studied Theoretical Physics at the University of Leeds, attaining a first-class master’s degree, and has since taken up composing more seriously alongside graduate work in the IT sector in Leeds. As the bass player in a progressive rock band based in Yorkshire, he contributes to the composition of the band’s original music, which has so far resulted in a 7 track album. James is rapidly expanding his body of works to various smaller classical ensembles, with a view towards orchestrating for ensembles of all sizes. With a keen interest in harmony and orchestration, his compositional style tends to incorporate modal tonalities and diverse harmonic frameworks, which he will continue to use in future works.\n\nContributing exciting and accessible original pieces to various repertoires, through works that connect emotionally with the listener, are particular driving forces behind James’ composition. He is keen to collaborate with musicians and ensembles of all shapes, sizes and abilities, and would ask anyone who enjoys the work already submitted to get in touch to discuss commissioning a composition.\n\nJames Pickering studied Music at the University of Manchester and the Royal Northern College of Music, completing the prestigious and demanding joint course. He also graduated with two Professional Performance Diplomas in Solo Performance and Chamber Music. As a Tuba player he worked with many of the leading Brass Ensembles and Orchestras in and around the North of England. Following surgery that left him unable to perform at the highest level he switched focus to Music Education and Composition. He is currently the Head of Music at the exclusive Dulwich College Seoul, South Korea.\n\nAs a Composer James’ output has mainly been written for friends, colleagues and students. His influences are broad and varied but include a great debt to Professor John Casken who helped open his eyes to the many possibilities available to a composer in the twenty first century. As a brass player and pianist James has a natural affinity writing for these instruments but has branched out in recent years, writing several solo pieces for strings and a Clarinet Sonata. His output also includes a group of Cello and Tuba duets that take advantage of the many playing techniques both instruments are capable of and the colourful sounds these can create.\n\nJason McMahon is a clarinetist, pianist, composer and actor/director based in the North West of England. He studied Music and Drama at the University of Manchester including Clarinet with Jill Allen and composition with Dr Camden Reeves. Born [1993] and raised in Preston, Jason is proud of his Lancashire heritage and is delighted to be working in the area, and with people he has known for many years. A contemporary music enthusiast, Jason is keen to celebrate new music by performing new works by relatively unknown as well as established composers, such as Michael Finnisy. Furthermore, Jason celebrates new music by writing contemporary music of his own, which has been described by some as “groundbreaking” as well as innovative, dramatic and fun. Jason is also interested in music education and wishes to enjoy a career in music and drama in schools across the county, showing children the importance of the arts in the foreground of British society and identity and not sidelined as some would wish for them to be. Much of Jason’s work both as a composer and performer centres around working with fellow composers on commissions, and with actors, directors and dancers to try and bring the art forms [music and drama] closer together, particularly in performance. The majority of Jason’s research is focused around the impact of musical performance, the power and suggestion of music through performance; and most importantly the drama in the music, the ‘dramma per musica’. It is this research which is fundamental in the foundations of Jason’s compositions and theatre pieces\n\nJo Griffiths has moved into Composition after a career in teaching spanning 24 years.

His mother who before her marriage had been a professional singer continued with her singing during his formative years so he was exposed from an early age to a variety of musical styles and influences ranging from Schubert, Schuman and Brahms to Faure Debussy and De Falla ; and from Bach ,Handel and Purcell to Vaughan Williams and Roger Quilter. In his early teens he was a Chorister at Westminster Cathedral when the Master of the Cathedral Music was George Malcolm. Thwarted of his ambition to read English at Cambridge due to poor A Levels he decided to become a Solicitor . During the training period in Articles for that profession he started to compose (mainly songs – heavily influenced by Quilter and Peter Warlock.) After qualifying and during the ensuing years as a busy Solicitor in private practice he had little time for composing though he did produce some small pieces and completed a Trio for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet and a Quartet for these instruments plus Bassoon both of which were subsequently published and still remain in print.\n\nHe took up the Clarinet after leaving school and this has enabled him to join the woodwind section in various orchestras and to participate in ensembles where it is useful that he has both a Bass Clarinet and a Basset Horn .\n\nAs he is less involved now with active playing due to somewhat defective vision he is now able to devote more time to composing; incidentally he is entirely self taught.\n\nApart from music he has had a life time love of cricket and in recent years has taken up croquet which has involved him in creating and maintaining his own modest croquet lawn.\n\nMike Dale was born in 1959, and has lived in the north west of England all his life.\n\nAt school age he began to learn guitar, and had clarinet lessons, but it was only at the end of his time at school that he took up what is now his main instrument, the saxophone. Later while at college studying piano tuning he added the flute.\n\nHe has since studied music with the Open University. After college, he played in several rock bands, one of which was played on the BBC a couple of times. Most of his playing time nowadays is spent playing in saxophone ensembles; quartets and an octet, although he does a lot of jazz, and some big band playing. Mike began composing at school, and has been doing so ever since.\n\nMyrto Korkokiou has a BA in Music (Ionian University) and an Mmus in Performance (LCMM –London). She is currently elaborating a doctoral research in flute performance with electronic means at the Ionian University. She has participated in festivals of electronic and modern music in Greece and abroad such as: Electroacoustic Days in Corfu, Rethimno, Lixouri, Athens Megaron of Music, Philippos Nakas Hall, Aboutt, Beton7, Onassis Cultural Centre, Salford Sonic Fusion Festival (Manchester), 8th Convention of British Flute Society in RNCM (Manchester, 2012), 41st Annual National Flute Association Convention (New Orleans, 2013), 40th international Computer Music Conference (ICMC/SMS 2014), 43rd Annual National Flute Association Convention (Washington D.C).

She teaches music at the Music and Motion Lab for people for special needs in Agia Paraskevi, Athens. http://myrtokorkokiou.wordpress.com/ www.youtube.com/user/MyrtoKorkokiou https://independent.academia.edu/MyrtoKorkokiou\n\nMyrto Korkokiou and Apostolos Loufopoulos have been collaborating since 2000 in composing and performing widely works for flute and electronic sounds, computer processed and prerecorded in real time and diffusion. Her main interest in music involves improvisation and performance with electronics means, as well as composition for flute and electronics. In their works the main target is to create sound environments, life like or imaginary, where the flute is the center of the sound action. The flute with the use of modern flute techniques creates a variety of timbres, which extend and enrich its sound spectrum when combined with electronic sounds either pre-recorded, or processed in real-time. Their pieces have been awarded in electroacoustic composition competitions such as Franco Evangelisti, 32 Bourges International Competition, Music Nova 2004, 2006, 2014, Dimitri Dragataki 2007- 2008) and they have been published by Forton Music: https://www.fortonmusic.co.uk/.\n\nNicole Buetti is an award winning composer, with over 300 recorded musical works in a wide variety of genres.

I was a founder member of the Northern Saxophone Quartet, and at a different time, a piccolo player in The Cyprus State Orchestra. I have played Flute with Sir James Galway, and Saxophone with Eugene Rousseau. During the last fifteen years, I have been The Director of Music in six International Schools.

He has studied voice with Beverly Johnson of the Juilliard School of Music, Elizabeth Coss of The Metropolitan Opera, Laura Sarti of the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, and with the wonderful singer, Anne Mason. He has had an international career as an opera and concert singer for over 25 years, including leading tenor roles with the New York Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and Milan’s La Scala opera houses, to name but a few.

He has composed, performed and recorded jazz and theatre music with Kenny Clayton and toured as guest soloist with Lesley Garrett.\n\nOn the concert stage, he has performed with the Kantanti Ensemble both in London and Lewes, singing songs by Richard Strauss and Britten’s Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings. He has also performed in Paris, at Amsterdam’s Concertgebuow, at the Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center in the US, throughout the UK and much of the rest of the world, singing repertoire from Bach and Handel through to Britten and Berg.\n\nPaul and his wife created the award-winning children’s music label, Walking Oliver, (named after their dog) and he spends a lot of time in his recording studio writing and arranging for various music libraries and production companies.

He then became a freelance horn player in London where he played mainly in the chamber orchestras and chamber groups such as the Endymion Ensemble. For many years he played with English Touring Opera and made over 50 recordings with the Academy of St. Martins in the Fields and the City of London Sinfonia. He has since taught the horn at Junior Trinity and at Exeter University and coached chamber music with the British Horn Society, and on courses such as Dartington International Summer School, Cubertou in France, Segovia in Spain and the English Camerata International Chamber Music Summer School where many of his arrangements for wind players have been performed.\n\nPhilip Joy is a retired Baptist Minister and M.E. sufferer who lives in Essex, UK. Trained as a cellist and largely self-taught in composition, Philip did not discover his personal voice until the early years of the new millennium, which resulted in a substantial score for Wind Orchestra called Variations on a Crowd written for Timothy Reynish, and a Trio for Harp Violin and Cello called Discourse. These works established an aesthetic of beauty, the use of harmonic structures built on a triad higher up the overtone series and a direct approach to rhythm. In this way Philip is proud to draw inspiration from the riches of the Western mainstream whilst bringing to it the freshness of New Consonant Music. He has had a number of professional performances including chamber works by the Turner Ensemble, the Barkham Harp Quartet, Sara Stowe, Charles Hine, and Serenata Winds as well as performing his own cello music in local concert venues; orchestral performances by established amateur groups include Ex Libris Aureis for the Lavenham Sinfonia and the more recent substantial Donata for Essex Chamber Orchestra, scored for Triple Woodwind. He is a valued member of the Central Composers’ Alliance, and through more recent creative partnerships with Colchester New Music has written scores for the British Clarinet Ensemble, the National Flute orchestra, and with the encouragement of Forton Music is currently engaged in a work for the Lug Double Reed Band. A string rather than a wind specialist, Philip nonetheless delights in the texture and colour offered by Wind and Brass music and is particularly fascinated by the possibilities offered by ensembles of single wind families. In addition he has a large back-catalogue of compositions written for various ensembles no longer in existence due to the 2008 financial crash: several choral miniatures for the RSCM, a Cello Concertino Retro Variations, a String Quartet Melisma and a duet for Violin and Viola Mozart Balls. He has written a 45-minute Sacred Music Drama based on a the Medieval English Mystic Cloude of Unknowinge, (to a Libretto in the Middle English prepared by the composer) and is currently at work on his first symphony.\n\nRichard Lambert was born in Bath, UK. His musical studies were at universities in Bristol, London and Surrey. His teaching career spanned 34 years in four schools (32 of which were as Director of Music), but he now combines a career as composer, examiner and organist. He is a Senior Examiner, Trainer and Moderator for the London College of Music, travelling, since 1989, to many centres in Europe, North and South America, Africa and the Far East. He continues to enjoy this work, drawing on his long experience of music-making and working with young people. Richard has written a highly successful GCSE music guide, published by Longman (Pearson Education). Whilst his earlier compositions were influenced by twentieth-century mainstream styles, with traces of jazz and popular music, his more recent music uses a freely atonal idiom or a serial technique, combined with tightly-knit structures.\n\nRichard Nye is a composer and teacher living in the UK. His first published work, Three Pyrotechnics for Solo Clarinet (1993 – pub. Cascade Music Publishing) is now included as part of the Trinity College Advanced Clarinet repertoire.\n\nRichard was a chorister at Gloucester Cathedral and began composing at a young age.

A work composed to accompany the Circus Prints by the late American artist, John Collier. Richard also works with samples, historical recordings and visual media, winning an ‘honourable mention’ for his collaborative work And the Earth Stood Still at the first Fresh Minds Festival in Texas. In 2013 he composer The Marvellous Machine. This piece for 8 hands at one piano was commissioned by the British pianist Nadia Lasserson for four of her pupils who, using the work, became the eventual winners in the ensemble category of the Jaques Samuel piano competition in 2013. It was performed at the Wigmore Hall, London, in November of the same year. The piece was also featured at the 2015 and 2016 Summer School for Pianists ‘Piano Now!’ concert.\n\nRichard continues to combine experimental works such as Underworld performed at the University of Bremen in 2014 by Juan Maria Solare and Still for a Minute?

Robert has a doctorate degree in composition from Florida State University, as well as degrees from the University of Missouri-Columbia (MM Composition), and the University of Northern Colorado (MM Oboe Performance, BM Composition and Oboe Performance).\n\nRoma Cafolla is a Northern Irish composer of Irish/Italian background and her music has a Latin, Mediterranean flavour coupled with an Irish folk tradition which is discernible in much of her work. Unashamedly full of melody she has produced works in many moods and styles, ranging from the naive and simple, to the technically complex, deeply emotional and romantic. In complete contrast there are also works that are full of humour and wit and possess a light hearted Celtic charm. She is a prolific composer who writes on-demand very quickly once an idea for a work has formed.\n\nDeeply committed to music education she has written a considerable amount for less advanced players and children in graded books called “Playarounds” as well as more demanding works such as Sonatas and Concertos for those with more developed technique.\n\nHer musical collaboration with clarinettist Leslie Craven (Principal Clarinettist of Welsh National Opera) has inspired her to write many new works for that instrument and a CD of her works involving clarinet was released on the Hedone label available in 2014.
