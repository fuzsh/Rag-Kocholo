        "text": "UPDATE: Here's a link to the city's survey, please fill it in to let them know what you want in the new park: https://lnkd.in/gUCi8dga ORIGINAL POST: Tonight's the night! I look forward to seeing all of you lovely OC Bikers, Skaters, BMXers, Scooters, Rollers and Bladers tonight at the Irvine Town Hall at **6pm at Portola Spring Community Park!*** I'll be wearing a bright yellow Digit Bikes T-shirt if you want to find me. I'm told that the city is quite commited to developing a multi-use facility as a starter kit for all-wheeled fun, and hopefully later developing more specialist features such as a BMX track, advanced skate features, etc... They want our feedback on how to include everyone, and to see that there's community support for it! Local bike leaders - I think your voices would be valuable. There might be opportunities for your organizations and our local community to benefit from this at little/no cost (The city is NOT looking for funding). I've proposed that it would be great to have a bike share from the train station with lock/charge facilities around the park. Perhaps local commuters could use this too - imagine a bike shop with leased secure storage at the train station, where they could do maintenance and sales. Maybe an ebike demo facility? The city liked these ideas. Perhaps you could help orchestrate something like this, or inject better ideas at the meeting... See y'all there."
