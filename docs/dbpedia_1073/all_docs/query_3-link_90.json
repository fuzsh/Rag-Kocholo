        "text": "I had sailed only twice before coming to Provincetown. I had always liked boating — I rowed in Central Park as a boy, and in time became a strong canoeist — but I never learned to swim well. For me, part of being on any boat was my constant awareness of the cold menace of the water below. Down there, inches below the surface, lay not sunlight sparkle but hopeless dark struggle and death by drowning. Boating, however, was freedom, even less constrained than riding my bike. To boat was to control the world of water.\n\nFifty-three years ago, when I was a medical student, my lab friend Philip invited me to the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, where he had a summer membership. Sailing was elite, I feared. People who sailed had gotten somewhere and would go further. The Veronica Lodges of the world sailed, but I was an Archie at best, and on most days a Jughead. For me to get anywhere had always required countless repetitions of effort. I was used to being in the galley, on a bench with an oar to manage.\n\nBut I accepted Philip’s invitation, and on a warm Saturday my then-wife and I drove down to the cove where a fleet of Gannets awaited. Philip showed us how to step the mast, tighten the stays, arrange the rudder. He let us raise the sails and hold the tiller. You fastened a halyard quickly and right, the way you tie a surgical knot. Philip’s mellow New Orleans accent reassured us as we set out. I loved the ease of not paddling, the light air and gentle motion, the motorless silence, the bubbles that streamed off astern. “Ready about!” I cried, and I became a sailor.\n\nLate that afternoon, tired and sunburnt, we ate steamers and drank beer at a bar where the TV was showing Mississippi civil rights disturbances in color. That was my first glimpse of color television. Life was now in color. Anything was possible. I could even sail.\n\nThe next summer, I returned to the Corinthian sailing club. All they wanted was my name. They didn’t even require proof that I could swim 50 yards, which had been a condition of my college degree.\n\nMy wife and I had the sense to arrange a first outing as a foursome with another couple. They came from families that had sailed themselves to Bermuda.\n\nOn the appointed Saturday the four of us piled picnic lunches into our VW bug. Things had changed at the club: while I recognized masts, stays, and tillers, the boats were somehow sleeker now, 420s, ready to race. Instead of warm air caressing us under blue skies, the damp blast that urged us out along the dock pressed my windbreaker cold against my back.\n\nI peeked at how the other couple rigged their boat. They set out first. Our hull tilted as we eased ourselves aboard. My wife took the sheets, I clutched the tiller, and next thing we were reaching toward Portugal at what felt like 20 knots. We boiled past the other couple, who laughed and clapped. “You do know how to sail!” they cried. The truth was we were baffled and terrified and having our biggest fight ever about which was the safe way to turn, and which was not.\n\nTwo hours later we somehow managed to dock and wobble onto terra firma. I did not sail again for 20 years.\n\nIn Provincetown, my new wife, Lise, introduced me to the Sunfish her father had given her. Its red, white, and blue sail and varnished daggerboard appealed. I would work this out by myself. I studied a book. Then, Jack Kearney, family friend, sculptor, and old Navy man, took pity on me. With kindness and off-color jokes, he would teach me to sail.\n\nJack took me out on his boat, the Jay Bird. And he sailed with me on the Sunfish. In time, I dared bigger and bigger winds alone. To sail out beyond the point was a joy, but I also cruised the length of the beach, to inspect my neighbors and their houses, as they, I came to learn, scrutinized my technique.\n\nLise didn’t like sailing much. But sailing alone let me think. And as long as Jack sailed in Provincetown Harbor, I enjoyed our sailors’ fellowship afloat.\n\nOne bright July morning, Jack hailed me aboard the Jay Bird at high tide. It might have been our first sail together that season. I paused only to exchange my shoes for a six-pack and waded out to join him in the warm breeze that rippled the bay. That evening he and his wife Lynn and Lise and I would get together with my father-in-law and his wife, who had just arrived from Connecticut. But now it was time to sail.\n\nGlorying in the day’s possibilities, we tacked and reached and came about and ran and jibed and told each other the same reliable jokes until the tide called us back to Jack’s mooring. Pink-cheeked from sun, wind, and beer, we carried the cooler through ankle-deep water and tracked damp sand into the house to find an ambulance departing with my father-in-law.\n\nOnly half understanding, we piled into cars to follow it to Cape Cod Hospital.\n\nMy father-in-law was the artist Robert Motherwell. Forty-four years ago, I shook the hand he painted with when I asked him for his daughter’s hand. He appreciated the gesture but kept his distance, so we never got to know each other well. His birthday was January 24. His parents named him Robert Burns Motherwell, after the Scottish poet, who had been born on January 25, 1739, but I was told that he found that presumptuous.\n\nI was also born on January 25, and also named Robert, but no one told me I had a namesake. Whatever Bob Motherwell may have felt, I found our coinciding names and birthdays amusing.\n\nI was still practicing medicine on that July day in 1991. But as we hurtled down Route 6, I was a husband and a son-in-law, not a doctor. Lise and Lynn and Bob’s wife, Renate, and I didn’t talk much in the car. He’d looked bad on the stretcher.\n\nAhead of us, the wailing ambulance careened. I kept my eyes on the road and tried to drive unexcitingly. We bit our lips through Eastham and around the circle and west, until we rolled up to Cape Cod Hospital’s emergency entrance next to the parked ambulance with its rear door still open.\n\nThe women rushed in ahead of me and down a corridor to inquire at the desk. I paused in unexpected quiet: no hubbub, no overhead pages, no clatter of crash carts. A porter was mopping. I knew my way around an emergency room. There was the big treatment room right inside the ambulance entrance. Its door was open. I crossed the threshold.\n\nHe lay alone, supine. No color. Not breathing. His right arm, his painting arm, had fallen off the edge and hung down toward the floor. I took his hand — it was cold — and held it as I assured him again that I would take good care of Lise. I replaced it at his side, tucked in the sheet. I wished we had known each other better. I admired and envied all he had achieved.\n\nWell, as our namesake’s song has it, “a man’s a man for a’ that.”\n\nI stayed with him until the nurses led the rest of the family in, and then it was like every other ending. This had happened. Presently we got back into the car and drove home to Provincetown. For a while, life would be a hard pull in the galley rather than sailing free, but I had learned how to do both.\n\nR.S. Steinberg of Provincetown and Cambridge is author of the novel Albie’s Struggle. This story is condensed from the version he read at Gail Strickland’s Provincetown Story Night in August 2018.\n\nA red sky is bisected by a darker red column, shadowed in black. Affixed are three paper fragments.\n\nThe one at left is sheet music from Arthur Berger’s Trio for Guitar, Violin, and Piano. The scrap on the right comes from Mozart’s Don Giovanni. Top left is one of Robert Motherwell’s famous ink splatters.\n\nIn the bottom left corner is scrawled, “For Arthur Berger, in Memory of Paris, 1939.” In the opposite corner is Motherwell’s signature and “unique collage print, 1987.”\n\nThe Red and Black, No. 55, as the artwork is titled, is essentially a collage on a print. It appears on the cover of Berger’s memoirs, Reflections of an American Composer.\n\nIt is part of a series of 56 works that Motherwell did around 1987. They all have the same ground, printed by Catherine Mosley, based on his 1975 Pas de Deux. The series title comes from Leonide Massine’s ballet Rouge et Noir.\n\nMotherwell used sheet music in many of his collages. “The calligraphic musical notes in the compositions served a largely visual purpose,” states his catalogue raisonné. “Because Motherwell could not read music, for him the notes were a kind of abstract language that conveyed the idea or feel of music.” The Provincetown Art Association and Museum owns one example, Untitled (after J.S. Bach), from 1988.\n\nBerger was music critic of the New York Herald Tribune in the 1940s, but later turned to composition. “I am my own severest critic,” he said in a 1966 issue of Inside Provincetown. He died in 2003.\n\nAccording to a 2001 issue of Provincetown Arts, “Since shortly after 1950 he has dwelt on the Cape for a good part of each year, first in Wellfleet and then in Truro.” Other eminent composers lived here as well — Berger was friendly with Elliott Carter and Gardner Jencks.\n\nBerger’s friendship with Motherwell, however, predates their Cape connection. In 1939, both were graduate students at Harvard, Motherwell in art history and philosophy, and Berger in musicology.\n\n“When I went to Paris on the John Knowles Paine Traveling Fellowship he decided to make a trip abroad at his own expense since he (or his parents) could well afford it, and we saw each other there several times,” Berger wrote of Motherwell in Reflections of an American Composer. “We commiserated together on our academic situations: he, an artist, committed to dry historical studies and I, a composer, committed to musicology. I suggested he talk to the lively art critic-historian Meyer Schapiro at Columbia.\n\n“Looking back,” Berger continued, “he later wrote in an autobiographical note that the advice I gave him in Paris had been ‘a most crucial external suggestion,’ and for the seventy-fifth birthday tribute that a Provincetown museum undertook for me, he did a collage memorializing our Paris talk.”\n\nThe “Provincetown museum” that Berger cited was actually Long Point Gallery. Motherwell was not the only gallery artist to supply a tribute to Berger. So did Paul Resika, Budd Hopkins, Varujan Boghosian, Judith Rothschild, and Leo Manso.\n\nThere was also a performance of Berger’s Words for Music, Perhaps for mezzo-soprano, flute, clarinet, and cello, performed by Blair Resika, Eleanor Lawrence, Ian Greitzer, and Bernard Greenhouse. Resika still has materials and clippings from the event.\n\nLong Point regularly put on cross-disciplinary exhibitions. In a 1986 issue of Provincetown Arts, Manso is mentioned as saying that such shows stimulated artists to think in different mediums, like a poet translating from a foreign language.\n\nWhen it comes to Motherwell’s The Red and Black, No. 55, however, the dates don’t quite line up. The Long Point tribute happened in July 1986; the collage print is dated 1987. Plus, according to his New York Times obituary and other sources, Berger was born in May 1912, making him only 74 when the tribute happened.\n\nCindy Nickerson wrote in an 1986 article in Time Out, “ ‘I think that’s the best thing he’s done in a long time,’ enthused a woman viewing a collage by Robert Motherwell. Titled Trio (After Arthur Berger), the work contains a piece of sheet music by Berger, set against irregular rectangles of red, black and rust. A piece of torn rust paper with one of Motherwell’s famous black marks — marks resembling enlarged details of powerful calligraphic figures — overlaps the music. The mood is restrained.”\n\nThough the name of the artwork is different, the description (and musical piece alluded to) fits The Red and Black, No. 55. It could have been a prototype — several works from this period use Berger’s music. And the birthdate may have gotten revised. An article at the time by Leah Rush states that Berger was 75, born in 1911.\n\nFor confirmation, the Independent could not find installation images of the show. The current owner of The Red and Black, No. 55 is unknown, according to Motherwell’s catalogue raisonné.\n\nIn any case, Motherwell’s collage print inspired Berger to compose Diptych, consisting of Collage I and Collage II, in 1990, and Collage III in 1992. These works are based on Berger’s 1984 Woodwind Quintet and his 1976 Composition for Piano Four Hands, respectively, and are written for mixed ensembles of woodwinds, strings, piano, and percussion.\n\n“I could insert notes and whole passages, much as we insert ornaments at cadenzas in Baroque music, and I could ‘cover over’ some of the music (i.e. put new music in),” Berger wrote in his papers, reproduced in liner notes by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. “Just as a fragment of paper pasted on the print obliterates what was originally there.”\n\nThough details remain mysterious, it’s clear that Provincetown was an important nexus of musical and artistic history.\n\nUntil summer returns, the art galleries in Provincetown are mostly quiet, though surely planning for next season’s traditional Friday evening strolls. That’s when everyone takes to the streets, zigging and zagging from gallery to gallery to experience the creative expression of established and emerging artists. And did we mention the wine and cheese at every stop?\n\nThe depths of winter need not, however, be a season of creative starvation. The Provincetown Art Association and Museum and the Fine Arts Work Center are open year-round, as is Provincetown Town Hall, on whose walls hang masterpieces from the early art colony, the sight of which may take some of the sting out of paying one’s property tax bill.\n\nFor those in search of a different kind of stroll, Provincetown’s historic cemeteries are a kind of en plein air art gallery. One could argue that all cemetery “art,” from stark colonial iconography to sumptuous Victorian design, is worthy of appreciation as an expression of human skill and imagination. But in our graveyards one finds personalized tributes to the disparate folk who shaped Provincetown and chose it as their final resting place.\n\nAlong Alden Street, bisecting the Catholic and Alden cemeteries, the first access road on the left as one travels from Shank Painter Road brings art lovers to the grave of caricaturist Henry Major, whose stone is adorned with a William Boogar bronze. Boogar, a celebrated sculptor and beloved member of the early art colony whose work can be seen at the head of MacMillan Wharf and in Truro’s Snow Cemetery, used one of his stylized, signature seagull sculptures for the bronze, adding wave and scallop shell flourishes. It is inscribed, “He has taught all men a respect for life.”\n\nBorn in Hungary, Henry Major arrived in America in 1923 and became well known for his caricatures of entertainers. He created a popular stock character, the Gay (in the dated sense) Philosopher, whose image, said to have been a self-portrait, was used on promotional items like matchbooks, calendars, and playing cards. The Gay Philosopher dispensed nuggets such as “Empty carts always rattle the loudest,” “Middle age is when our tripping becomes less light and more fantastic,” and “You can’t be a howling success simply by howling.” Said to have been soft-spoken with a twinkle in his eye, Major arrived in Provincetown sometime in the early 1930s and, though he was a married man, had a long-term relationship with psychoanalyst Clara Thompson, at whose home he died in September 1948 and in whose cemetery plot he is buried.\n\nLike Truro’s Snow Cemetery, Provincetown has its own “artists’ corner” in the Alden Cemetery (Section A), where luminaries including Norman Mailer, Stanley Kunitz, Ross Moffett, Jack Tworkov, and Robert Motherwell repose side by side.\n\nMotherwell maintained a summer home and studio in Provincetown beginning in the mid-1950s. He was the youngest of a group of New York Abstract Expressionists that included Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Jack Tworkov, though unlike his colleagues he also explored collage and printmaking. Motherwell’s memorable series Beside the Sea (1962) was inspired by Provincetown’s seductive light and pounding sea spray. His grave, marked by a large stone, bears a bronze inscribed with his signature.\n\nCross the invisible boundary into the Alden Old Section and find the marble sculpture on the grave of Nanno de Groot, one of the most distinctive works of art in the cemetery. Born in the Netherlands in 1913, de Groot spent years in the maritime and shipping business before dedicating himself to art. Self-taught, he moved to New York after World War II and was affiliated with Abstract Expressionism. Married in 1948 to poet and painter Elise Asher, de Groot arrived in Provincetown in 1956. By 1958, he and Asher had divorced (she later married Stanley Kunitz), whereupon he married artist Pat (Richardson) de Groot. He died just five years later. Pat designed and sculpted his headstone, a Zen-like dancing figure with arms encircled overhead. When she died in 2018, she was buried beside him.\n\nA stroll up the hill from the de Groot plot leads to the grave of Provincetown’s longtime shellfish warden, John J. Gaspie. Born in Pico, Azores, in 1884, he came here as a young man. His legendary harvesting skills (chef Howard Mitcham described Gaspie and himself as nocturnal clam bootleggers) earned him the nickname “Clamdigger.” Later he became, as Mitcham anointed him, Lord Protector of the Quahaugs. When he died in 1961, family and friends honored him with a headstone on which a quahaug is elegantly sculpted in bas-relief. The stone’s inscription, recognizing Gaspie as “a true conservationist, a raconteur and wit, beloved by all who knew him,” and its accompanying tombstone humor, is a work of art in its own right.\n\nMitcham, whose 1975 Provincetown Seafood Cookbook was dedicated to Gaspie, wrote, “If you scratch a quahaug out of the sand on Provincetown’s clam flats you can probably rest assured that the ghost of John J. Gaspie will be watching you from the great beyond. If a still small voice says to you, ‘That quahaug’s too little, put him back!’ you’d better do so pronto.” Where visitors to other graves mark their pilgrimages with small stones, John J. Gaspie is remembered with clamshells.\n\nAcross Cemetery Road, which divides the Alden sections from Hamilton and Gifford, a life-size dog rests, protectively and attentively, with paws outstretched, on the grave of G.B. Smith. Master Mariner Gamaliel Bowley Smith, the son of England-born Mark Smith and Truro-born Ruth Cobb Brown, was the captain of the passenger steamer George Shattuck that plied the waters between Provincetown and Boston twice weekly beginning in 1863. Owned by Joshua and Gideon Bowley, the vessel docked at the end of Court Street, at Bowley’s Wharf, renamed Steamboat Wharf.\n\nMystery surrounds G.B. Smith’s grave, dated 1874. No one who is buried in the plot died that year, though with the arrival of the railroad in 1873, steamship service was discontinued the following year, 1874. By 1880, Smith and his wife, Sarah, were living in Boston where they both died months apart in 1888. Could the 1874 date correspond to the last voyage of the Shattuck and Capt. Smith’s departure from his hometown? His will, which mentions the upkeep of his grave, makes no mention of the dog. Was it a faithful companion?\n\nOnce we are drawn in by a headstone’s aesthetics, it becomes a portal to knowing more about those people no longer among us. Ars longa, vita brevis."
