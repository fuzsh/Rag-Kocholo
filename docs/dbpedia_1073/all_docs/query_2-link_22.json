        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt's an ordinary day for Arthur - he's just faked a heart attack to get out of Maths and is contemplating the beauty of Gwen Lott. But a glimpse of her bra strap sets off a chain of events that reveals that Arthur's so far rather pitiful life is far from ordinary. He and his new (only) friend Lawrence are about to discover that they are the spirit of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table reborn| Our noble heroes must save Albion Wood and a rare species of 'white bird fingies' from destruction...God's swimming trunks| Are they up to the challenge?\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom AudioFile\n\nWilkinson's modern adaptation of the King Arthur story is not only clever but also very funny. No one is more surprised than Arthur King when he finds himself \"reincarnated\" as the legendary King Arthur. Along with his friends (who also possess Arthurian names), Arthur fights to save Albion Woods from developers. Narrator Steven Pacey brilliantly presents each charming young character and the police chief, who sings to detainees and metes out punishments that include singing. Pacey is given a chance to demonstrate his considerable singing skills. This delightful story was meant to be read, and Steven Pacey is the perfect person to do it. S.G.B. © AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- Copyright © AudioFile, Portland, Maine\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGrade 3-5 - Arthur King, 13, is an expert at making up excuses (such as female problems) to get out of class and gaze upon Gwen Lot, his dream girl. He's rather innocent and odd, having no idea how obvious he is to everyone. When he meets a younger boy named Lawrence, who just happens to be Gwen's brother, the three kids become involved in fighting Mordred Holdings' plan to clear Albion Wood to put up a shopping center. A number of coincidences and Lawrence's fertile imagination convince Arthur that he is the reincarnation of King Arthur, meant to lead the people of England to victory. Bratty school girl Faye Morgan and bully Barry Guthries complicate matters considerably. But sweet Arthur continues his quest to win the heart of his true love. The silly farce continues with many parallels to familiar Arthurian legends. Narrator Steven Pacy, an English actor, wonderfully conveys different accents, some of which may be a bit of a challenge for American listeners. His deadpan delivery of Arthur and Lawrence's ridiculous plots and beliefs is particularly funny. He's also quite a good singer, as when the police chief who requires everything be sung to him receives a deputy's report sung to the tune of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" It's all very light and exaggerated, fun and unbelievable. Ultimately, Arthur King saves the day with a little help from his friends. Has he learned any lessons? Nope, it's time to explore the possibility of being the reincarnated Robin Hood. - B .
