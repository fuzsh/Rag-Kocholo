Miss Julie

play by Strindberg

Miss Julie, full-length drama in one act by August Strindberg, published in Swedish as Fröken Julie in 1888 and performed in 1889. It was also translated into English as Countess Julie (1912) and Lady Julie (1950). The play substitutes such interludes as a peasant dance and a pantomime for the conventional divisions of acts, scenes, and intermissions.

Julie, an aristocratic young woman, has a brief affair with Jean, her father’s valet. After the sexual thrill has dissipated, they realize that they have little or nothing in common. Heredity, combined with social and psychological factors, has determined their futures. Strindberg portrays Julie as an aristocrat whose era has passed and Jean as an opportunistic social climber to whom the future beckons.
