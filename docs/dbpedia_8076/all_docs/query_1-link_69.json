        "text": "About fifteen years ago, I worked on an adaptation of August Strindberg’s “Miss Julie,” for a black actress friend of mine. My version of the 1888 Swedish story was set in nineteenth-century Haiti, and portrayed the rich, spoiled, self-destructive title character as Creole gentry who wielded the power she did and did not want on her family’s estate (her off-stage father would be a white rum merchant). As I envisioned the piece, the servants were dark-skinned blacks, and class played itself out along the color bar. Working on the play taught me many things, chief among them being that Strindberg, whose mother was a fierce serving maid, had written—or, more specifically, supplied—the bones for the kind of drama it was almost impossible to wreck through interpretation, particularly if you stuck to his major themes, which was how class and power intersected with sex.\n\nEver since Strindberg wrote “Miss Julie,” which grew out of his deeply troubled relationship to his aristocratic wife—for a time he doubted the paternity of their children—mixed in with his newfound interest in naturalism and a strange fascination with hypnotism, the ensemble drama has been refashioned in a number of fascinating ways, ranging from Patrick Marber’s 1995 “After Miss Julie,” which transposed the setting to Great Britain in 1945 during the Labour Party’s landslide victory, to Mike Figgis’s very fine 1999 film starring Saffron Burrows in the title role, all the way to a Chinese adaptation that was staged in Beijing earlier this year.\n\nThe South African playwright Yael Farber’s “Mies Julie” (at St. Ann’s Warehouse, directed by the author) is an important contribution to the Strindberg-inspired canon—indeed, Farber’s adaptation is the strongest I have ever read, and completely her own. But her beauty as a writer is undermined by her direction, which relies on the same old stomach-churning clichés when it comes to miscegenation. Technically, Farber’s “Mies Julie,” which is set on the Eastern Cape, in Karoo, South Africa, a dust bowl of a place, is not so much an adaptation of Strindberg’s tale of Jean (here named John, and played with virtuoso physicality by Bongile Mantsai), a male servant who aids in Julie’s (Hilda Cronje) ultimate self-destruction, as it is a jumping off point for Farber’s chief interest: how black maleness extracts its revenge against female whiteness.\n\nThis concern is as old as “Mandigo,” and can be, to the liberal imagination certainly, an interesting “problem,” but it’s not, really: Farber has taken her script and made pornography. The stage is the kitchen where the majority of the action takes place. We begin with a woman who is credited as “Ancestor, Singer, Musician” (Tandiwe Nofirst Lungisa). Her head wrapped in checkered fabric, and sporting a large skirt, Lungisa walks down the stairs from where the audience sits. She walks slowly, and circles the stage, which is in the round. As she does so, she half hums and half sings an ominous tune. She is the soul and sound of Something Dramatic Is About to Happen.\n\nTaking a seat on the periphery of the kitchen, we watch as Christine (Thoko Ntshinga) goes about her work: wiping up the floor, feeding her son. Unlike Strindberg’s Christine, who was Jean’s fiance, Farber’s Christine is John’s mother, and, in another significant move on Farber’s part, Julie’s former nanny. In fact, Christine is the only real family Julie has ever had—her mother is dead and her father absent—and it’s Julie’s dependence on his mother that is just one of the grudges John has against this woman he’s known since she was a girl: How could his mother love the loveless (but rich) Julie and not him? But why would John feel that when it’s clear, in the play’s opening minutes, that his mother loves him, too? John has never reconciled himself to his mother being a nanny. Nor does he understand her tenderness was being paid for, and that’s just one way Christine and her son could survive under apartheid.\n\nJulie wouldn’t perceive that Christine has always played a role; she needs her softness, even though she’s been raised to be hard. Which is one reason why Julie seeks out John’s brutalizing attention: it’s the only thing that can break through her various roles, her smugness, and carelessness with others. Barefoot and dressed in a thin skirt and a low-cut top, Julie enters the kitchen and lies across Christine’s table; she’s undone by her own sensuality. This is the first of Farber’s mistakes as a director: no nanny of Christine’s strength would allow a child to lie across a kitchen table. She wants the hovering John to see her and, as the beautiful, deep-voiced Cronje plays it, Julie has been waiting for him to see her for most of her life.\n\nStill, Julie has the upper hand and can control John’s gaze: she’s white, and John still lives with the fear that South Africa has instilled in him, at least historically. His country has degraded blackness and maleness in the past, so what can he know or feel about his future? All he can do for revenge against the shackles of the past is sort of free himself by ravishing Julie. Not once. But twice. Or maybe three times, I can’t remember, since the “shock” value of John rolling down his jumper and then tearing at Julie’s top was so blatant a bid for “drama” that its cheapness was the least of my problems. I was more concerned with Farber’s gradual tearing down of Julie, who ends up being a sacrificial, bloody victim-doll that John gets to throw around, whipping up the “steam,” that causes reviewers to call this production steamy when it’s sort of corny and careless and anti-feminist to boot: why should Julie pay for her whiteness?"
