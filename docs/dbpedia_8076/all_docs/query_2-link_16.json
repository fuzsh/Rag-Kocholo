        "text": "There were only a few performances of Miss Julie at Dramaten before it went on tour to 14 places in Sweden.\n\nSpain, Madrid, International Theatre Festival, 28 February-3 March 1986\n\nFour performances were recieved with much applause. However, the murder of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme shifted the press attention to the political events.\n\nFinland, Vasa, Wasa Teatern, 15-17 April 1986\n\nThe three performances were sold-out and the reviews were enthusiastic.\n\nIceland, Reykjavik, 7-8 June 1986\n\nBergman made a rare appearance and at the press conference he talked about the different versions of Strindberg's manuscript and about his love of the theatre, referring to his stagecraft as 'a natural, simple, unneurotic and creative process'.\n\nCanada, Quebec International Theatre Festival, Grand Theatre, 12-14 June 1986\n\nThe three performances of the Dramaten production of Miss Julie did not play full houses, though it received standing ovations in the Grand Theatre.\n\nItaly, Spoleto Music and Theatre Festival, 23, 25, 27 June 1986\n\nIncluded in the festival was a retrospective showing of selected Bergman films.\n\nScotland, Edinburgh, King's Theatre, 30 August-1 September 1986\n\nThe Royal Dramatic Theatre performance took place in the renovated King's Theatre, where accoustic problems with the loudspeakers caused simultaneous translation to echo on stage. The critics don't seem to have been bothered. Michael Billington in The Guardian wrote, 'Bergman makes us see Strindberg with completely new eyes'. In The Observer Michael Ratcliffe established, 'Miss Julie emerges as a much richer and fuller play than ever before'."
