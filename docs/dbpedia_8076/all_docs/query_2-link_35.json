        "text": "“I am always drawn to plays that inspire me, and to plays that make me angry. This was a play that made me angry.”\n\nWhen the Guardian speaks with director Kip Williams, he is halfway through rehearsals for his new production of Miss Julie for Melbourne Theatre Company. The director describes it as a “daunting” time, as he and the cast pick apart the play’s questions around class, gender and feminism.\n\nFirst performed in 1889, August Strindberg’s play tells of a count’s daughter – a strong-willed woman who was raised by her mother to “think like and act like a man” – who dallies with her father’s ambitious servant, with tragic consequences. It’s a piece Williams has long wanted to tackle.\n\nHe has written a new adaptation of the play, taking apart what he describes as the inherent misogyny of the original, in which Strindberg damns his lead character for her independence. Instead, Williams throws light on the character of Miss Julie herself, and examines how she would fare during that period of history. In place of some of the character’s more hysterical monologues, for instance, his adaptation looks at exactly why Julie wants to leave the estate – and her privileged position – behind.\n\n“[There is] this powerful desire within her to break those expectations, but then the crisis for her is then what lies beyond ... what is the actual future that [she] can forge?”\n\nThe director puts the play’s enduring popularity down to the collision between sex and power. “Questions of gender, class, race, sexuality, all facets of identity – those are the questions we constantly have to come back to and interrogate within ourselves and society.”\n\nAt 29-years-old and only five years into his career, Williams is a rising star on the Australian theatre scene. He’s resident director at Sydney Theatre Company, was the proud recipient of last year’s Helpmann award for best director for Suddenly, Last Summer, and will have helmed four mainstage productions in 2016, including Miss Julie and The Golden Age, as well as upcoming productions of All My Sons and Midsummer Night’s Dream. He was also touted as a frontrunner for the STC artistic directorship, before Jonathan Church was announced for the top job.\n\nHis work is vibrant and exciting, and yet seems to be mostly focused on the classics. Does he prefer old work over new? He laughs. “Not necessarily,” he says. “It really depends on the conversation that’s at play in that text.”\n\nWilliams says he enjoys doing classics because they explore universal themes which remain relevant and fascinating. “As somebody who is interested in having a conversation with an audience about who we are today, [they offer me] an opportunity to ask big questions, and hopefully offer an experience to renegotiate those ideas.”\n\nIt’s an interesting discussion to have with a director given the worrying decline of new Australian work on main stages this year. Earlier this month, after examining the 95 mainstage shows slated for 2016, the Australian Writers Guild found the number of new works by Australian writers or devisors was down from 63% in 2015 to 56% in 2016. Of the 53 works, 34 are original (35%) while 19 were adaptations of existing works, such as books.\n\nAdaptations are pragmatic choices for theatre companies, in a time when arts funding is precarious – but does that also mean Australian audiences are unadventurous, preferring tried and true work over the unknown?\n\nWilliams doesn’t think so. While there is undeniably a recognition factor for Australian audiences, he believes it’s more about relevancy. He points to the run of Australian works in Sydney recently: The Secret River and his production of The Golden Age, along with Jasper Jones and The Blind Giant is Dancing at Belvoir.\n\n“What we saw in Sydney earlier this year was a number of productions which had a real need to talk about Australia, about our history but also where we stand today – particularly to do with our national identity, and our relationship to immigration and to Indigenous Australia,” he says. “Audiences responded to it in droves, they wanted to be part of that conversation.”"
