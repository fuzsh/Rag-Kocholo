Presented by the Online Stage.\n\nMiss Julie is probably the most famous play by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg, one of the founding fathers of naturalistic theater. In this claustrophobic drama, the interplay between social order and individual identity is explored in great detail. In the end, the aristocratic Julie, goaded by her manipulative manservant, John, is faced with the ultimate decision: independence or annihilation.\n\nAmazon/Audible • iTunes\n\n//samples.audible.com/bk/mike/001493/bk_mike_001493_sample.mp3"
