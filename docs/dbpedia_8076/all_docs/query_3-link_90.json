        "text": "Copyright Â© Hans HÃ¶gman 2020-01-22\n\nThe Strindberg Family\n\nThe Strindberg family originates from the town of SollefteÃ¥ in the county of VÃ¤sternorrland (province of Ã ngermanland). Many members of the Strindberg family have been working at the SollefteÃ¥ Iron Mill (SollefteÃ¥ Bruk). The mill was closed a long time ago. The map below shows VÃ¤sternorrland County (LÃ¤n) in Sweden with SollefteÃ¥ town. VÃ¤sternorrland is in mid Sweden and SollefteÃ¥ is located about 550 km north of Stockholm. The population of SollefteÃ¥ is 8,562 (2010). The county code of VÃ¤sternorrland is \"Y\". For example SollefteÃ¥ (Y).\n\nThe Strindberg Name\n\nIn Sweden we began using family names at the end of the 1800-hundreds, that is children inherited the same surname as their father. In the year 1901 a law was passed stating that we had to use family names. Before that we used patronymic names. That means that the children were given a last name ending with -son or -dotter (daughter) and started with the fatherâs first name. For example, if a man called Anders Nilsson had a son named Peter and a daughter named Anna, the childrenâs full name would be: Peter Andersson and Anna Anderssdotter. That is Peter son of Anders and Anna daughter of Anders. If Peter had a son called Nils, then Nilsâs full name would be Nils Petersson. Normally the \"-son\" surnames are spelt with two \"s\". These ways of giving surnames (patronymic) are still used on Iceland. At the end of the 1800's when people started to change their patronymic surnames to family names they often took a family name with a local association to nature, farm name, village name etc. But most people kept their \"-son\" name as a family name. The map to the right shows the town of SollefteÃ¥ and the farm \"KlÃ¤pparna\". The river is \"Ã ngermanÃ¤lven\". A more detailed map. The patronymics were mostly used in the rural areas. Among nobility, clergy, the military, etc they started much earlier with family names. Priests often spelt their names in Latin way, for example Laurentius Hornaues (Lars from Horn). The different groups had different patterns of names.\n\nWhat about the Strindberg name?\n\nThere are many Strindberg families in Sweden that is not related and this is the story of \"my\" Strindberg family. We have to go back to the beginning of the 1800's. My mother's father's father's father Adam Strindberg (1800-1863), born in Strinne village, parish of MultrÃ¥ (Y), changed his patronymic name to the family name Strindberg. His father was Adam Michelsson (1769- 1810) so Adam Strindberg was born Adam Adamsson. Adam was a blacksmith at the SollefteÃ¥ Iron Mill. In the year 1821 when he got married to Anna Holmberg (1798-1869) he is listed in the church records under the name of Strindberg. At that time he had the title mÃ¤stersven (master smith) and he probably changed his surname to a family name when he became a professional blacksmith. The first part of the Strindberg name probably comes from the village name Strinne were Adam was born (Strinne was spelt Strinde in former days). Berg means mountain.\n\nMy motherâs fatherâs parents\n\nMy mother's father's father was Petrus Strindberg, born December 14, 1849 in SollefteÃ¥ Bruk (Y). He died February 8, 1920 in BjÃ¶rkÃ¥, ÃverlÃ¤nnÃ¤s parish (Y). Petrus worked at the SollefteÃ¥ Bruk (SollefteÃ¥ Iron Mill). My mother's father's mother was Martha Dorothea Andersdotter. She was born February 4, 1855 in KnÃ¤sjÃ¶n, SollefteÃ¥(Y). She died in 1924 in BjÃ¶rkÃ¥, ÃverlÃ¤nnÃ¤s parish (Y). The image to the right shows Petrus and Martha Strindberg, SollefteÃ¥ Bruk (Y).

Albert built the farm at the end of the 1910's. The image to the right shows Anna and Albert Strindberg, SollefteÃ¥ (Y). Anna and Albert had 5 children: 1. Bror Erland (1922 - 1997) SollefteÃ¥ 2.

Ulla Kristina (1934 - ) SollefteÃ¥ Albert and Anna are buried at the SollefteÃ¥ Cemetery .\n\nMy Mother's Motherâs Parents\n\nMy Grandmother Anna's father was Lars Abraham Pettersson, born April 5, 1862 in the village of VÃ¤stergransjÃ¶, Helgum (Y).
