Strindberg had intended a public premiere of the work, with his wife Siri von Essen playing the title role, as part of his Scandinavian Experimental Theatre. However, shortly before the scheduled opening night, the Danish censor banned any public performances of the play. In an act of desperation, he arranged a private staging of it at the Students’ Union. It did not receive its public premiere until 1892 when it was staged in Germany and would not be produced in Sweden until 1904.\n\nThe play concerns the eponymous Julie, with all the action is set in one location: in the kitchen. Julie, the daughter of a Count, has recently disappointed her parents by calling off an engagement to a rich suitor. The majority of the play focuses on the interaction between Julie and the Count’s servant, Jean. Julie seeks attention from Jean as she becomes mired in confusion over her identity and desires, while Jean looks to elevate his status and position in society. In the preface to the play, Strindberg contends that the motivation for what occurs between the characters is not simple, but the ‘result of a whole series of more or less deep-rooted causes’. The author famously refers to Miss Julie as ‘man-hating half-woman’ and he explains that this type of woman ‘represents degeneration’. Strindberg not only highlights gender conflict as a crucial theme, but also foregrounds the issue of class and Darwinian notions of struggle and survival. Miss Julie is symptomatic of a decaying aristocracy, whose ruin partially lies in ‘that inherited or acquired sense of honour that has been transmitted to the upper-classes’, while Jean is the beginning of a ‘new species’ that is ‘quick to learn’ and is ‘strong enough not to hesitate to make use of other people’, which means ‘he will escape from the battle unwounded’.\n\nMiss Julie would become one of Strindberg’s most successful works and remains one of his most frequently performed plays in the twenty-first century. It has been adapted for both television and film, including a 1951 Swedish film, called Froken Julie, starring Ulf Palme and Anita Bjork. There was also a 1965 BBC television adaptation starring Alan Bridges and Ian Hendry; and in 1999, Mike Figgis directed a film version, starring Saffron Burrows and Peter Mullan.\n\nAn image from the 1984 London Internationalist Theatre production\n\nCONTENTS\n\nEdith and Warner Oland Translation\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nCOUNTESS JULIE\n\nEdwin Björkman Translation\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\n\nPERSONS\n\nMISS JULIA\n\nThe first production in Stockholm of ‘Miss Julie’ in November 1906, at The People's Theatre\n\nEdith and Warner Oland Translation\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nCOUNTESS JULIE, twenty-five years old\n\nJEAN, a valet, thirty\n\nKRISTIN, a cook, thirty-five\n\nFARM SERVANTS\n\nThe action takes place on Saint John’s night, the mid-summer festival surviving from pagan times.\n\nCOUNTESS JULIE\n\n[SCENE. — A large kitchen. The ceiling and walls are partially covered by draperies and greens. The back wall slants upward from left side of scene. On back wall, left, are two shelves filled with copper kettles, iron casseroles and tin pans. The shelves are trimmed with fancy scalloped paper. To right of middle a large arched entrance with glass doors through which one sees a fountain with a statue of Cupid, syringa bushes in bloom and tall poplars. To left corner of scene a large stove with hood decorated with birch branches. To right, servants’ dining table of white pine and a few chairs. On the end of table stands a Japanese jar filled with syringa blossoms. The floor is strewn with juniper branches.]\n\n[Near stove, an ice-box, sink and dish-table. A large old-fashioned bell, hangs over the door, to left of door a speaking tube.]\n\n[Kristin stands at stove engaged in cooking something. She wears a light cotton dress and kitchen apron. Jean comes in wearing livery; he carries a large pair of riding-boots with spurs, which he puts on floor.]\n\nJEAN. Tonight Miss Julie is crazy again, perfectly crazy.\n\nKRISTIN. So — you’re back at last.\n\nJEAN. I went to the station with the Count and coming back I went in to the barn and danced and then I discovered Miss Julie there leading the dance with the gamekeeper. When she spied me, she rushed right toward me and asked me to waltz, and then she waltzed so — never in my life have I seen anything like it! Ah — she is crazy tonight.\n\nKRISTIN. She has always been. But never so much as in the last fortnight, since her engagement was broken off.\n\nJEAN. Yes, what about that gossip? He seemed like a fine fellow although he wasn’t rich! Ach! they have so much nonsense about them. [Seats himself at table.] It’s queer about Miss Julie though — to prefer staying here at home among these people, eh, to going away with her father to visit her relatives, eh?\n\nKRISTIN. She’s probably shamefaced about breaking off with her intended.\n\nJEAN. No doubt! but he was a likely sort just the same. Do you know, Kristin, how it happened? I saw it, although I didn’t let on.\n\nKRISTIN. No — did you see it?\n\nJEAN. Yes, indeed, I did. They were out in the stable yard one evening and she was training him as she called it. Do you know what happened? She made him leap over her riding whip, the way you teach a dog to jump. He jumped it twice and got a lash each time; but the third time he snatched the whip from her hand and broke it into pieces. And then he vanished!\n\nKRISTIN. Was that the way it happened? No, you don’t say so!\n\nJEAN. Yes, that’s the way the thing happened. But what have you got to give me that’s good, Kristin?\n\nKRISTIN. [She takes things from the pans on stove and serves them to him.] Oh, it’s only a bit of kidney that I cut out of the veal steak for you.\n\nJEAN [Smelling the food]. Splendid! My favorite delicacy. [Feeling of plate]. But you might have warmed the plate.\n\nKRISTIN. You’re fussier than the Count, when you get started. [Tweaks his hair.]\n\nJEAN. Don’t pull my hair! You know how sensitive I am.\n\nKRISTIN. Oh — there, there! you know I was only loving you.\n\n[Jean eats, and Kristin opens bottle of beer.]\n\nJEAN. Beer on midsummer night — thank you, no! I have something better than that myself. [Takes bottle of wine from drawer of table.] Yellow seal, how’s that? Now give me a glass — a wine glass you understand, of course, when one drinks the genuine.\n\nKRISTIN. [Fetches a glass. Then goes to stove and puts on casserole.] Heaven help the woman who gets you for her husband. Such a fuss budget!\n\nJEAN. Oh, talk! You ought to be glad to get such a fine fellow as I am. And I don’t think it’s done you any harm because I’m considered your intended. [Tastes wine.] Excellent, very excellent! Just a little too cold. [Warms glass with hands]. We bought this at Dijon. It stood at four francs a litre in the bulk; then of course there was the duty besides. What are you cooking now that smells so infernally?\n\nKRISTIN. Oh, it’s some devil’s mess that Miss Julie must have for Diana.\n\nJEAN. Take care of your words, Kristin. But why should you stand there cooking for that damned dog on a holiday evening? Is it sick, eh?\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, it’s sick. Diana sneaked out with the gatekeeper’s mongrels and now something is wrong. Miss Julie can’t stand that.\n\nJEAN. Miss Julie has a great deal of pride"
