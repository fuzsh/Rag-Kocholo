        "text": "As deep in sentiment as the Empire State Building is high, Leo McCarey’s “Love Affair” stood alone amongst classic Hollywood romances; awaiting its partner film for 18 long years.\n\nMost famous for being remade by its own director nearly two decades later as “An Affair to Remember,” McCarey’s original film doesn’t so much exist in the shadow of its later incarnation, as it does compliment its match of a narrative in a shared body and soul.\n\nBoth “Affairs” follow the story of a French philanderer and a retired singer who fall in love on an ocean liner, then plan to meet rendez-vous at a later date atop the Empire State Building. “Love,” though, has such strength of initial affection, that…\n\nLove is an intangible thing and it is therefore fascinating to see it represented by other intangibles, symbolized by endearing hobbies that evoke inward machinations. 1939’s Intermezzo implements a metaphor of music to help interpret the love story. Transitional scenes are used as little reprieves, or decrescendos (at pianissimo), that intermingle with the heavier accented plot moments. Music has the ability to overwhelm the human senses as does love. Music truly, has the power to tap into any or most emotions, to describe the things that are seemingly out of reach. All the pieces to a composition are the idiosyncrasies required to provide such depth, volume, and dynamic.\n\nLeo McCarey’s 1939 film Love Affair does a similar maneuver. Terry & Michele…\n\nIt works so well, even when you don't expect it to. And it works completely against the odds. Director Leo McCarey entered production of Love Affair without a completed script and he encouraged his actors to improvise all the way through. The finished version bears the imprint of this improvisation but the first cut was so poor that McCarey had his old pal Edward Dmytryk summoned from Paramount to RKO to perform a proper editing job on the film. And it went on be a box-office success and a six-fold Oscar nominee.\n\nIrene Dunne is sublime. She was a queen of the reaction shot and it's impossible not to fall in love with her in this. Charles Boyer is an…\n\n2nd Leo McCarey (after Duck Soup)\n\nIf there’s a love affair here, it’s one entirely of the mind. I don’t remember seeing a single kiss throughout the film, which is strange for what’s seen as one of the great romantic dramas, but it somehow works in context because of the sweet innocence of Terry and Michel’s interactions. McCarey’s camera lingers on their hands as they hold them, not their faces as they kiss passionately. It’s an expression of intimacy, certainly, but one without a flame behind it.\n\nNot to say that in a derogatory way, but rather to acknowledge that what they get out of their relationship is not physical stimulation (because Marcel gets that enough with his conquests, I…"
