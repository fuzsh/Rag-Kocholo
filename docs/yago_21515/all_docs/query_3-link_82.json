        "text": "An Affair to Remember (dir. Leo McCarey, 1957)\n\nCurzon Cinema, 46 Old Church Road, Clevedon, BS21 6NN\n\nSaturday 25 November 2023\n\nRating: PG\n\nRunning Time: 1hr 49mins\n\nTHIS EVENT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED\n\nTissues at the ready for this special screening of a Cary Grant classic! Join us at the iconic Curzon, Clevedon to see Cary Grant starring alongside fellow Bristolian Deborah Kerr in Leo McCarey’s timeless love story. A heart-wrenching weepy about unexpected lovers whose bond is so strong, not even great tragedy can break it. With a sharp script and amazing performances the sentimentality never turns into schmaltz, which is the reason why it’s considered one of the greatest romantic films of all time. The film’s themes of love, loss, and redemption are as relevant today as they were when the film was released in 1957.\n\nNickie Ferrante (Grant), an incorrigible playboy, and Terry McKay (Kerr), a nightclub singer, meet on a transatlantic ocean-liner en route to their respective fiancees in New York. Their friendship gradually blossoms into a clandestine love-affair as they try to avoid gossip onboard ship. As the ship docks in New York City, they agree to reunite in six months time, if they have managed to end their current relationships and prove themselves worthy of each other. It’s a story of chance encounters, fate and the life altering power of love – what’s not to enjoy? And the big question – Will they both make it to their rendezvous at the top of the Empire State Building…?\n\nOur Venue partner\n\nFor information on getting to the Curzon head here. Read more about the history and heritage of the Curzon here. We’re really excited that the Curzon’s balcony has recently reopened after 50 years – tickets are selling fast for the sofas, so snap them up while you can!\n\nTrailer\n\nYou might also be interested in…."
