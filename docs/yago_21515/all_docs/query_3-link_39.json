Will these two ever get together again?\n\nWriter/director McCarey remade this priceless romance eighteen years later in color as “An Affair to Remember,” with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Better known and beloved by many, that version runs a half hour longer than the original. We prefer this tighter, more restrained outing. Beyond the script and sumptuous design of costumes and sets, the central performances positively shimmer, with French actor Boyer and the Kentucky-bred Dunne emitting surprisingly powerful chemistry. McCarey captures it all brilliantly, while minimizing the over-sentimentality he was often prone to. Fall in love with “Love Affair.”"
