        "text": "Two people meet on a flight to Sydney. Although both are engaged to others, they fall in love during their evacuation after a forced landing, and agree to meet in New York City three months later if the attraction lasts.\n\nEx-football star Mike Gambril meets Terry McKay on a flight to Sydney, which is forced to land on a small atoll. Both engaged to others, they become romantically attached on board the ship sent to take the passengers to a larger island. They agree to meet in New York City three months later to see if the attraction is real. One shows up, the other doesn't, but they run into each other afterwards.â€”Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>"
