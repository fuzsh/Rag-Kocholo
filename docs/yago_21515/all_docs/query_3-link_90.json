        "text": "An update of the classic romantic story, LOVE AFFAIR stars Warren Beatty and Annette Bening in the roles made famous by Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957’s AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, as the two people whose lives are changed when they meet, this time, on board a trans-continental flight to Australia. Former NFL football star turned sportscaster, Mike Gambrill (Beatty) is all set to marry wealthy talk-show host Lynn Weaver (Kate Capshaw). Former singer Terry McKay (Bening) is all set to marry handsome, wealthy investment banker executive Kenneth Bradley (Pierce Brosnan). When their plane is forced to land on a Pacific atoll, Mike and Terry experience a romantic paradigm shift and all thoughts of their impending nuptials are dashed. Will they take a chance on each other? Will they both show up in three months?\n\nLOVE AFFAIR is finely crafted with excellent performances by Beatty and Bening, plus an incredible scene-stealing performance by Katharine Hepburn, this enjoyable remake/new-version does impressive justice to its famous predecessors. A wonderfully made, warmly portrayed love story that manages to communicate without an abundance of foul language (although regrettably there is some), explicit sexual activity … that is LOVE AFFAIR."
