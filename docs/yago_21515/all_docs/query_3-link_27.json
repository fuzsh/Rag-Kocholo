        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nA French playboy, Michel Marnet (Charles Boyer, All This, and Heaven Too), falls for an American ex-singer, Terry McKay (Irene Dunne, The Awful Truth), during a transatlantic cruise. There is one minor problem: both are engaged to other people. They decide to give each other space and agree to meet atop the Empire State Building in six months.\n\nReaction & Thoughts:\n\nFinely directed by Leo McCarey (Going My Way), Love Affair is an old-fashioned romantic mood piece that has been overshadowed somewhat by its glossy 1957 remake An Affair to Remember (also directed by McCarey, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr). That’s really too bad because the original is a touching, sophisticated dramedy.\n\nBack in 1939 (often regarded as Hollywood’s greatest year), the film was hailed as a modern classic. It received numerous Oscar nominations. The film was also a big hit with audiences. However, next to other releases from that year — Gone with the Wind, Stagecoach, The Wizard of Oz, etc. — it doesn’t look like much today. Still, Love Affair is a charming mixture of romance, comedy, and melodrama.\n\nThe script by Delmer Daves (A Summer Place) and Donald Ogden Stewart (The Philadelphia Story) is a carefully calculated balance of humor and sentiment. The first half is by far my favorite section of the film. Later, the story moves into the territory of melodrama. It does get a bit mushy, but the genuinely poignant climax redeems the saccharine excesses.\n\nIrene Dunne has great rapport with Charles Boyer. The sophisticated stars look great together (Dunne and Boyer immediately re-teamed for another rom-com, When Tomorrow Comes, which was released the same year as this movie), and even hammy Maria Ouspenskaya (Dodsworth and The Wolfman), who plays Boyer’s grandmother, doesn’t spoil the fun.\n\nThe cast also includes Lee Bowman (Buck Privates), Astrid Allwyn (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) and Maurice Moscovitch (Make Way for Tomorrow). Watch out for future Warner Bros. starlet Joan Leslie (Sergeant York and The Hard Way) and Bessie “Queen of the Hollywood Extras” Love.\n\nThis elegant RKO production was beautifully shot by legendary cameraman Rudolph Maté (The Pride of the Yankees and Gilda). The original music is by prolific RKO composer Roy Webb (Magic Town and Marty). Co-edited by future director Edward Dmytryk (The Caine Mutiny and The Carpetbaggers).\n\nConclusions & Final Thoughts:"
