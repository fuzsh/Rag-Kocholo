        "text": "Remakes have been around nearly as long as Hollywood itself, and not always for the reasons or with the results you’d think. Spectrum Culture’s new feature Re-Make/Re-Model will examine the long history of cinematic remakes, the good movies turned great, the bad ideas turned worse and the weird ones turned boring.\n\nFor most films, we have only a single instance from which to draw conclusions, and this instance achieves an equivalence, as its only form, with the story considered as an abstraction. But film this same story a second time, and the abstraction then transcends either version, pulling both into its orbit and existing somewhere between them. This phenomenon is partly what distinguishes acting in the theater from acting in the cinema: in the former case, the role exists as a potentiality beyond the specific actors who have taken their turn with it, while in the latter case, it becomes incarnated in a single embodied performance, forever associated with that one actor—even remakes sometimes cannot erase our first memory. For a director to retread the same cinematic ground suggests the recognition of something deeper than the form taken by the first iteration: unfinished business, so to speak.\n\nThis idea of a ghostly return is fitting for a film like Leo McCarey’s An Affair to Remember, his 1957 film that emerged from out of his earlier Love Affair, rupturing it and fracturing its perfect surface. Both films share the same story (and nearly the same screenplay): a man and a woman, both engaged to other people, meet on a cruise ship and fall in love, promising to meet again on the Empire State Building six months later and, if they are still in love, finally marry, but en route to their appointment, the woman gets hit by a car, casting doubt on their eventual reunion until they meet again by chance. The few differences that are most apparent are key to understanding how McCarey’s rethought this story: the film is now in vibrant color instead of shimmering black and white, the CinemaScope aspect ratio replaces Love Affair’s more compact Academy ratio, and instead of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, we have Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.\n\nNone of these changes is superficial, but they all come to matter because of how they are refracted through McCarey’s newfound relationship to his story. More specifically, where the fleet-footed Love Affair, a romance with the verve of screwball comedy, blooms with lively and sweet innocence, the later An Affair to Remember aches and shudders with an awareness of mortality that seems absolutely foreign to the earlier film’s reverie-like atmosphere. Of course, McCarey had aged in between making the two films: he was 41 when he made Love Affair, about the same age as its two stars, but he made An Affair to Remember at the age of 59. Something else also happened in the intervening years: after directing Love Affair, McCarey was involved in a near-fatal car accident that left him temporarily confined to a wheelchair (grimly ironic considering the parallel fate of Irene Dunne’s Terry McKay in Love Affair). One hardly needs biographical evidence to explain McCarey’s sensitivity towards mortality—he had, after all, created one of Hollywood’s greatest films about aging in 1937’s Make Way for Tomorrow—but it’s difficult not to perceive that for the couple in An Affair to Remember, the stakes are so much higher and happiness is so much more in danger of slipping away forever.\n\nOne senses this directly in Cary Grant’s performance. Grant was 52 when he made the film, significantly older than the 40-year-old Charles Boyer of Love Affair. His tanned face appears aged and leathery, though still lovely. In contrast to Grant, Love Affair’s Boyer plays the cad, a begrudgingly likable playboy who makes his conquest of women plain to see. We care about his character Michel Marnet’s relationship with Terry McKay partly because he’s so honest and sincere, enough so that when he does fall in love with her, we trust his innocent intent. But what would happen to Michel if he and Terry never reunited again? He would probably land back on his feet and even fall in love with someone else, having learned that such a miraculous thing is actually possible. He has the air of an irrepressible child, and children shift allegiances too quickly for us to worry about them in the long term.\n\nContrast this with the autumnal Grant, who allows himself, in an expert performance as Nickie Ferrante, to look ever so slightly gauche initially, as he casually attempts to charm a woman more than 15 years his junior. In both versions, the male protagonist tells Terry (the name is the same in both versions) that he is relieved to meet her because she’s the only attractive woman on the cruise ship. Boyer delivers this line as a lovable scamp, brimming with barely concealed sensual zest. Grant layers his performance with a vulnerability missing in the earlier film. In his hands, this line of dialogue is the flimsy disguise of a man desperate to love a woman enough to need her but afraid of getting hurt. More so than Boyer in Love Affair, Grant seems surrounded by shadows, which McCarey makes heavy and palpable. Unlike a young man who can act without thinking of the future, Nickie recognizes that each experience might be the last one of its kind for him before the shadows close in on him completely.\n\nLove Affair is pure fantasy, thoroughly committed to its romantic vision, and its pleasures come from the way the world itself seems to conform to the love shared between these two individuals, making way for them as if with a red carpet. There’s a moment that illustrates this most clearly in a scene where Michel and Terry dine together. In both films, the male protagonist is a well-known playboy who draws the attention of the other passengers, and his relationship with Terry becomes more secret as it progresses, in order to avoid prying eyes. In Love Affair, after deciding that they can no longer dine together, Terry and Michel decide to sit at separate tables for dinner, but the waiter seats them at two adjacent tables, drawing the attention of the other passengers. When Terry and Michel become aware of this, McCarey cuts to a reverse shot showing a dining room full of people staring at them—or more specifically, at the camera, given that we see this shot from Terry and Michel’s perspective. This feeling of being gazed at is echoed in a later scene where Terry and a boy at the school where she teaches music perform a song, only to have everyone else around them stop and pay rapt attention. In Love Affair, this perfect couple is all that exists, and the entire world confirms their preeminence in its indifference to everything else.\n\nThis scene in the dining room also occurs in An Affair to Remember, but the overwhelming feeling is one of shame and self-consciousness. The diners don’t just stare, they laugh, and McCarey overlays a shot of Terry and Nickie reacting to their embarrassment with this laughter on the soundtrack, as if it emanates from their own self-awareness and not from the unseen crowd in the dining room. Every other new element in An Affair to Remember adds to this somber atmosphere, where two lonely people huddle together to preserve the spark of what may be their last chance at true love. The vibrant colors McCarey uses in the later film don’t necessarily create a livelier feel but instead hint at age and decay. These are not the silvery dreamlike hues of Love Affair, existing in a world apart from ours, but those of the mortal world, which inevitably gives way to rot. Moreover, the CinemaScope frame creates a greater sense of space and therefore distance, drawing attention to the reality of lovers drifting away from one another. Love Affair’s compact screen bundled its lovers together and comfortably assured them that no harm will befall them in the end.\n\nA scene of dialogue between Nickie and Terry, dialogue not featured in Love Affair, bears this underlying awareness of mortality out. “Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories. We’ve already missed the spring,” Terry says. “Yes, well this is probably my last chance,” Nickie replies. “Mine too.” “It’s now or never.” These changes may make An Affair to Remember a darker film, but its climactic scene resonates far more. Because love hangs on so precariously in the film, it becomes all the more precious. An Affair to Remember’s final scene is hauntingly powerful, a glimpse of lovers so hungry for love that they seem on the verge of devouring one another. Mortality is tempered by love, which is in turn made bittersweet. This fragility would seem wholly out of place in a fantasy of a romance like Love Affair, but it becomes triumphant in An Affair to Remember. Returning to his story from almost 20 years earlier, McCarey found a way to say something radically different despite keeping so much intact."
