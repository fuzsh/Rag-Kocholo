        "text": "GOOD MORNING: “She just grabs you,” Warren Beatty says of Katharine Hepburn, who plays his aunt in “Love Affair.” Hepburn wound her role Tuesday and Warren says, “I can’t say enough about her.” The people around Beatty can’t say enough about him and his care for Kate, who will be 87 on her next birthday, May 12. She was flown out here from New York in the Warner Bros. plane and Beatty set her up in a house with a pool — which she used — near his and Annette Bening’s home. During her 10-day stay here, Hepburn visited her old neighborhoods, some former movie locations and the beach. Her scenes on “Affair” were filmed on WB Stage 22, the set being her home in Tahiti. Monday night, she invited to dinner Stanley Kramer (who directed her and Spencer Tracy in his last film, “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner”), Kramer’s wife, Karen; their daughter, Katharine, Hepburn’s god daughter; and John Dayton, producer of Hepburn’s upcoming CBS telepic “This Can’t Be Love,” which will be screened Valentine’s Day at the DGA. Hepburn told the group, “This is my last movie,” and then laughingly added, “But keep me working”… In 1993, Paul Newman, president of Newman’s Own, donated $ 7 million to charities in both the U.S. and abroad. And since 1982, Newman’s donated more than $ 56 million to educational and charitable causes. A.E. Hotchner is Newman’s Own exec VP. One of the projects dearest to Newman’s heart is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, which he, A.E. and Ursula Hotchner founded in 1988 for children with cancer and other serious illnesses. Next month, they and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf break ground for another Hole in the Wall Gang camp, this one at Boggy Creek in Lake County, Fla. Newman’s all-natural (and all great!) products — salad dressings, sauces, popcorn, lemonade and salsa — bear labels with Newman’s own commentary and quips. Whatta contribution to the community is Newman and family.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nON THE HEELS OF TUESDAY’S mind-boggling predictions from the Superhighway Summit at UCLA, I learned of a TV show that will probably utilize the most sophisticated communications systems yet: The opening — and closing — ceremonies for the 100th-anniversary Olympics, bowing July 19, 1996. Exec producer Don Mischer, producer David Goldberg and writer Sarah Lukinson are in Atlanta this week. They meet with the Atlanta committee for the Olympic Games before heading to the International Olympic Committee meets in Switzerland. They talked with Coretta Scott King, Andrew Young and Mayor Bill Campbell about plan$ . There will be 16,000 athletes, compared with 9,000 here in L.A. And they expect a viewing audience of 4 billion in 200 countries. (NBC airs in the U.S.) Each country will be able to separate and “interpret” segments for ’emselves via the new technologies. Mischer, who did the Super Bowl halftime last year, says the technical possibilities are endless … Reaction around town to the Summit has been unanimous in that the potential is — beyond present comprehension. Gary Smith, who with Dwight Hemion has presented some of the greatest spectacles — like the presidential conventions, the Liberty weekend, etc., agrees: “It’s almost too much. I hope it’s not overkill.” Gary Smith says the Jackson Family Honors, as noted here Jan. 4, are a definite Feb. 19 at the MGM Grand. But Walter C. Miller will not be able to direct — a conflict with the Grammys … Gary Ross, scripter of the very funny White House-set “Dave,” is now completing his “A Couple of Points,” about the California gubernatorial race, for Universal. The lead is a 45-year-old charismatic male candidate. Ross also will direct. He is now researching with California gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown during the campaign. But Ross is not writing material for her — as he had for Bill Clinton’s presidential race."
