At the opening ceremonies of the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, 44 countries were represented in the stadium at Colombes. Around 45,000 spectators were present as the athletes and their coaches paraded their flags into the arena. More than 3,000 athletes competed in 17 sports, including football, track and field, swimming, and a new event: women's fencing. The 1924 Games boasted a few other firsts, including the first standard 50-meter pool with recognizable lanes, the Olympic Art competitions that were contested seriously, and an Olympic Village that was set up for the competitors and their crew-a practice that continues today. Track and field continued to be the most popular sport, but swimming attracted nearly as many spectators for the first time in Olympic history. These Summer Olympics were an event never to be forgotten, as many of the traditions that began in Paris continued through the Olympic Games that followed.
