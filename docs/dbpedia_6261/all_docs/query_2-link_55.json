Sci., 20, 1–12, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVertisols are cracking clayey, arable soils that often overlay groundwater reservoirs. The soil cracks enable flow that bypasses soil blocks, which results in both relatively fresh recharge of the underlying groundwater and contamination with reactive contaminants. These special phenomena, as well as unique mechanism of salinization after cultivation and relative resilience to contamination by nitrate typical to groundwater under vertisols, are reviewed in this study.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nImpact of two different types of El NiÃ±o events on runoff over the conterminous United States\n\nT.

A. Timms, R. Crane, D. J. Anderson, S. Bouzalakos, M. Whelan, D. McGeeney, P. F. Rahman, and R. I. Acworth\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 39–54, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-39-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-39-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLow permeability sediments and rock can leak slowly, yet can act as important barriers to flow for resource development and for waste sequestration. Relatively rapid and reliable hydraulic tests of \"tight\" geological materials are possible by accelerating gravity. Results from geotechnical centrifuge testing of drill core and in situ pore pressure monitoring were compared with a regional flow model, and considered in the context of inherent geological variability at site and formation scale.\n\nCarbon and nitrogen dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in constructed wetlands treating wastewater: a review\n\nM. M. R. Jahangir, K. G. Richards, M. G. Healy, L. Gill, C. MÃ¼ller, P. Johnston, and O. Fenton\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 109–123, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-109-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-109-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemoval efficiency of carbon and nitrogen in constructed wetlands is inconsistent and does not reveal whether the removal processes are from physical attenuation or transformation to other reactive forms. Previous research did not consider \"pollution swapping\" driven by transformational processes. Herein the biogeochemical dynamics and fate of carbon and nitrogen and their potential impact on the environment, as well as novel ways in which these knowledge gaps may be eliminated, are explored.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSpatio-temporal assessment of WRF, TRMM and in situ precipitation data in aÂ tropical mountain environment (CordilleraÂ Blanca,Â Peru)\n\nL.

While none of the products meets the challenge of representing both accumulated quantities and frequency of occurrence at the short timescale, we concluded that new methods should be used to merge those various precipitation products.\n\n| Highlight paper\n\nDiagnosing hydrological limitations of a land surface model: application of JULES to a deep-groundwater chalk basin\n\nN.

Suh, C.-H. You, and D.-I. Lee\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 193–207, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-193-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-193-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper was written to find the climatological characteristics of raindrop size distribution (DSD) with respect to the wind direction in Busan, Korea. The data were collected by POSS disdrometer during 4 years (2001–2004). Busan shows the tendency of land-sea breeze. When sea wind blows during rainfall period, mean size and number concentration of raindrop are smaller and larger than that of land wind blows, respectively. It means that the features of DSD depend on the wind direction.\n\nTime series of tritium, stable isotopes and chloride reveal short-term variations in groundwater contribution to a stream\n\nC. Duvert, M. K. Stewart, D. I. CendÃ³n, and M. Raiber\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 257–277, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-257-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-257-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe transit time of water is a key indicator of hydrological processes at the catchment scale. Our results suggest that the use of tritium time series in streamwater can be highly valuable for assessing the temporal variations in the transit time of older groundwater contributions to streamflow. We also show that, shortly after high flow events, the transit time of the old water fraction increases and tends to approach the groundwater residence time.\n\nClosing the water balance with cosmic-ray soil moisture measurements and assessing their relation to evapotranspiration in two semiarid watersheds\n\nA. P. Schreiner-McGraw, E. R. Vivoni, G. Mascaro, and T. E. Franz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 329–345, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-329-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-329-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil moisture estimates from a novel method were evaluated in two semiarid watersheds. We found good agreements between the technique and estimates derived from watershed instruments designed to close the water balance. We then investigated local hydrologic processes and link between evapotranspiration and soil moisture obtained from the novel measurements.\n\nHigh-frequency monitoring of water fluxes and nutrient loads to assess the effects of controlled drainage on water storage and nutrient transport\n\nJ. C. Rozemeijer, A. Visser, W. Borren, M. Winegram, Y. van der Velde, J. Klein, and H. P. Broers\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 347–358, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-347-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-347-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nControlled drainage has been recognized as an effective option to optimize soil moisture conditions for agriculture and to reduce unnecessary losses of fresh water and nutrients. For a grassland field in the Netherlands, we measured the changes in the field water and solute balance after introducing controlled drainage. We concluded that controlled drainage reduced the drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the field, but did not have clear positive effects for water quality.\n\nEstimation of deep infiltration in unsaturated limestone environments using cave lidar and drip count data\n\nK. Mahmud, G. Mariethoz, A. Baker, P. C. Treble, M. Markowska, and E. McGuire\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 359–373, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-359-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-359-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCaves offer a natural inception point to observe both the long-term groundwater recharge and the preferential movement of water through the unsaturated zone of such limestone. In this study, we develop a method that combines automated drip rate logging systems and remote sensing techniques to quantify the infiltration processes within a cave.\n\nNew interpretation of the role of water balance in an extended Budyko hypothesis in arid regions\n\nC. Du, F. Sun, J. Yu, X. Liu, and Y. Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 393–409, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-393-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-393-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe define the equivalent precipitation to include local precipitation, inflow water and soil water storage change as the water supply in the Budyko framework. With the newly defined water supply, the Budyko curve can successfully describe the relationship between the evapotranspiration ratio and the aridity index at both annual and monthly timescales in unclosed basins. We develop a new Fu-type Budyko equation with two non-dimensional parameters (Ï and Î») based on the deviation of Fu's equation.\n\nAn index of floodplain surface complexity\n\nM. W. Scown, M. C. Thoms, and N. R. De Jager\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 431–441, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-431-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-431-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn index of floodplain surface complexity is developed in this paper and applied to eight floodplains from different geographic settings. Floodplain width and sediment yield were associated with the index or with sub-indicators, whereas hydrology was not. These findings suggest that valley and sediment conditions are important determinants of floodplain surface complexity, and these should complement hydrology as a focus of floodplain research and management.\n\nSocio-hydrological modelling: a review asking \"why,Â whatÂ andÂ how?\"\n\nP. Blair and W. Buytaert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 443–478, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-443-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-443-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper reviews literature surrounding many aspects of socio-hydrological modelling; this includes a background to the subject of socio-hydrology, reasons why socio-hydrological modelling would be used, what is to be modelled in socio-hydrology and concepts that underpin this, as well as several modelling techniques and how they may be applied in socio-hydrology.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nIntegrated water system simulation by considering hydrological and biogeochemical processes: model development, with parameter sensitivity and autocalibration\n\nY. Y. Zhang, Q. X. Shao, A. Z. Ye, H. T. Xing, and J. Xia\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 529–553, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-529-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-529-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an integrated water system model by coupling multiple water-related processes in hydrology, biogeochemistry, water quality and ecology, and considering the interference of human activities. The parameter sensitivity and autocalibration modules were also developed to improve the simulation efficiency. The proposed model was applied in the Shaying River catchment, which is a highly regulated and heavily polluted region in China.\n\nJoint inference of groundwater–recharge and hydraulic–conductivity fields from head data using the ensemble Kalman filter\n\nD. Erdal and O. A. Cirpka\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 555–569, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-555-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-555-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGroundwater recharge and hydraulic conductivity are both important properties of a groundwater system. However, models using an erroneous conductivity field can be compensated by a false recharge field to construct the same type of hydraulic head observations. In this work we show that prior knowledge is very important when estimating parameter fields from ambiguous data (such as head observations). If the prior information is reasonable, the joint parameter estimation can be possible.\n\nA scaling approach to Budyko's framework and the complementary relationship of evapotranspiration in humid environments: case study of the Amazon River basin\n\nA. M. Carmona, G. Poveda, M. Sivapalan, S. M. Vallejo-Bernal, and E. Bustamante\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 589–603, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-589-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-589-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study a 3-D generalization of Budyko's framework that captures the interdependence among actual and potential evapotranspiration and precipitation. We demonstrate that Budyko-type equations present an inconsistency in humid environments, which we overcome by proposing a physically consistent power law that incorporates the complementary relationship of evapotranspiration into the Budyko curve. Evidence of space-time symmetry and signs of co-evolution of catchments are also found in Amazonia.\n\nThe effect of assimilating satellite-derived soil moisture data in SiBCASA on simulated carbon fluxes in Boreal Eurasia\n\nM. K. vanÂ derÂ Molen, R. A. M. deÂ Jeu, W. Wagner, I. R. vanÂ derÂ Velde, P. Kolari, J. Kurbatova, A. Varlagin, T. C. Maximov, A. V. Kononov, T. Ohta, A. Kotani, M. C. Krol, and W. Peters\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 605–624, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-605-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-605-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoreal Eurasia contains extensive forests, which play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Droughts can modify this cycle considerably, although very few ground-based observations are available in the region. We test whether satellite-observed soil moisture may be used to improve carbon cycle models in this region. This paper explains when and where this works best. The interpretation of satellite soil moisture is best in summer conditions, and is hampered by snow, ice and ponding.\n\nTechnical Note: Testing an improved index for analysing storm discharge–concentration hysteresis\n\nC. E. M. Lloyd, J. E. Freer, P. J. Johnes, and A. L. Collins\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 625–632, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-625-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-625-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper examines the current methodologies for quantifying storm behaviour through hysteresis analysis, and explores a new method. Each method is systematically tested and the impact on the results is examined. Recommendations are made regarding the most effective method of calculating a hysteresis index. This new method allows storm hysteresis behaviour to be directly compared between storms, parameters, and catchments, meaning it has wide application potential in water quality research.\n\nIn situ unsaturated zone water stable isotope (2H and 18O) measurements in semi-arid environments: a soil water balance\n\nMarcel Gaj, Matthias Beyer, Paul Koeniger, Heike Wanke, Josefina Hamutoko, and Thomas Himmelsbach\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 715–731, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-715-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-715-2016, 2016\n\nThe WACMOS-ET project – PartÂ 1: Tower-scale evaluation of four remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration algorithms\n\nD. Michel, C. JimÃ©nez, D. G. Miralles, M. Jung, M. Hirschi, A. Ershadi, B. Martens, M. F. McCabe, J. B. Fisher, Q. Mu, S. I. Seneviratne, E. F. Wood, and D. FernÃ¡ndez-Prieto\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 803–822, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-803-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-803-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study a common reference input data set from satellite and in situ data is used to run four established evapotranspiration (ET) algorithms using sub-daily and daily input on a tower scale as a testbed for a global ET product. The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for satellite and in situ forcing as well as for the different temporal resolutions. PM-MOD and SEBS perform less well: the PM-MOD model generally underestimates, while SEBS generally overestimates ET.\n\nThe WACMOS-ET project – PartÂ 2: Evaluation of global terrestrial evaporation data sets\n\nD. G. Miralles, C. JimÃ©nez, M. Jung, D. Michel, A. Ershadi, M. F. McCabe, M. Hirschi, B. Martens, A. J. Dolman, J. B. Fisher, Q. Mu, S. I. Seneviratne, E. F. Wood, and D. FernÃ¡ndez-Prieto\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 823–842, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-823-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-823-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe WACMOS-ET project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates on global and regional scales. Evaluation of current evaporation data sets on the global scale showed that they manifest large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into several components. Different models perform better under different conditions, highlighting the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific model ensembles.\n\nEffects of a deep-rooted crop and soil amended with charcoal on spatial and temporal runoff patterns in a degrading tropical highland watershed\n\nHaimanote K.

Results show shifts in spatio-temporal patterns of interception, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, snow persistence and runoff production differently in contrasting aspect slopes. Forest thinning leads to net loss of surface water storage and to a less regulated runoff response during hydrologic extremes.\n\nA hybrid model to simulate the annual runoff of the Kaidu River in northwest China\n\nJianhua Xu, Yaning Chen, Ling Bai, and Yiwen Xu\n\nHydrol.

We question how future irrigation may supply additional water vapour to the atmosphere with growing agricultural production. Maintaining precipitation recycling could prevent degradation of rainfall-dependent terrestrial ecosystems and has the potential to minimize blue-water trade-offs between up- and downstream water users within the Amazon Basin.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nContrasting watershed-scale trends in runoff and sediment yield complicate rangeland water resources planning\n\nMatthew D.

These areas face great pressure to meet growing water needs. Data on large-scale dynamics that drive water planning remain rare. Our watershed-scale results challenge simplistic hydrological assumptions. Streamflow was resilient to dramatic landscape changes. These changes did shape sediment yield, affecting water storage. Understanding these processes is vital to projections of rangeland water resources in a changing world.\n\nModelling evapotranspiration during precipitation deficits: identifying critical processes in a land surface model\n\nAnna M.

More recently, a suite of geomorphometric techniques have been applied to characterize the seafloor. The dynamic, four-dimensional nature of the marine environment and differences in data collection methods cause issues for geomorphometry that are specific to marine applications.

Although TIR has slightly lower errors than MW with ground data under clear-sky conditions, it suffers increasing negative bias as cloud cover increases. In contrast, we find no direct impact of clouds on the accuracy and bias of MW-LST. MW-LST can therefore be used to improve TIR cloud screening and increase sampling in clouded regions.\n\nA new remote hazard and risk assessment framework for glacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya\n\nDavid R.

Drought can be alleviated or made worse by human activities and drought impacts are dependent on a myriad of factors. In this paper, we identify research gaps and suggest a framework that will allow us to adequately analyse and manage drought in the Anthropocene. We need to focus on attribution of drought to different drivers, linking drought to its impacts, and feedbacks between drought and society.\n\nUse of column experiments to investigate the fate of organic micropollutants – a review\n\nStefan Banzhaf and Klaus H.

Physical, thermal, and geophysical methods applied at several spatial scales indicate that DWM are located within or directly downstream of areas of substantial groundwater discharge to the river. DWM may depend on groundwater discharge for their survival.\n\nMultivariate hydrological data assimilation of soil moisture and groundwater head\n\nDonghua Zhang, Henrik Madsen, Marc E.

The study uses the ensemble transform Kalman filter method and the MIKE SHE hydrological model code. The proposed method is shown to be more robust and provide better results for two cases in Denmark, and is also validated using real data. The hydrological model with assimilation overall improved performance compared to the model without assimilation.\n\nSolar-forced diurnal regulation of cave drip rates via phreatophyte evapotranspiration\n\nKatie Coleborn, Gabriel C.

Our novel time series analysis using the synchrosqueeze transform identified daily and sub-daily oscillations in drip rate. The only hypothesis consistent with hydrologic theory and the data was that the oscillations were caused by solar driven pumping by trees above the cave. We propose a new protocol for inferring karst architecture and our findings support research on the impact trees on speleothem paleoclimate proxies.\n\nHydrologic controls on aperiodic spatial organization of the ridge–slough patterned landscape\n\nStephen T.

Sci., 20, 4457–4467, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4457-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4457-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ridge–slough landscape is a major part of the Everglades, a critically imperiled wetland in south Florida (USA). The landscape consists of two wetland types, shallow water ridges and deep water sloughs, interspersed in a complex pattern. Human changes to hydrology have changed this pattern, impacting water flow, fish movement, and bird habitat. Restoring pattern requires understanding its origins. We describe the pattern in detail, gaining insights relevant for management on its origins.\n\nReservoir storage and hydrologic responses to droughts in the ParanÃ¡ River basin, south-eastern Brazil\n\nDavi de C. D. Melo, Bridget R. Scanlon, Zizhan Zhang, Edson Wendland, and Lei Yin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4673–4688, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4673-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4673-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought propagation from rainfall deficits to reservoir depletion was studied based on remote sensing, monitoring and modelling data. Regional droughts were shown by widespread depletion in total water storage that reduced soil moisture storage and runoff, greatly reducing reservoir storage. The multidisciplinary approach to drought assessment shows the linkages between meteorological and hydrological droughts that are essential for managing water resources subjected to climate extremes.\n\nEvaluating the strength of the land–atmosphere moisture feedback in Earth system models using satellite observations\n\nPaul A. Levine, James T. Randerson, Sean C. Swenson, and David M. Lawrence\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4837–4856, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4837-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4837-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate a new approach to assess the strength of feedbacks resulting from land–atmosphere coupling on decadal timescales. Our approach was tailored to enable evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) using data from Earth observation satellites that measure terrestrial water storage anomalies and relevant atmospheric variables. Our results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that ESMs may be overestimating the strength of land surface feedbacks compared with observations."
