If you leave a blank then you may put the next answer in the blank by mistake.\n\nListen, Listen. Listen! Listen to everything the quizmaster has to say, especially about a difficult question. She/He may give some extra clues the second time he reads the question.

However answer the questions first. Don’t be so distracted/excited by the scoreboard that you forget to listen properly to the next round. Walk up and check your score if you cannot see the scoreboard or ask the helpers to tell you your score.\n\nDon't be afraid to complain if your score is wrong or if you feel you should have got a mark for an answer.
