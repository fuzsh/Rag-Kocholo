This study aimed to assess nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and lifestyle practices (KAP) that may lead to BC risk reduction among female university students in Lebanon and examine the determinants of their practices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a convenience sampling method, comprising 356 (response rate: 71.2%) female students at the American University of Beirut aged 18 to 25 years with no history of BC. Participants completed a pre-tested questionnaire addressing the objectives of the study. The modified Bloom’s cut-off of 75% was used to categorize knowledge and practice scores as poor or good and attitudes as negative or positive. Large proportions of students had poor knowledge (68.3%), negative attitudes (65.4%), and poor practices (98.0%) scores. Pursuing a health-related major and having a higher GPA were associated with better knowledge and attitudes while being older and having a lower degree of stress were associated with positive attitudes only. Having a lower body mass index (BMI) was associated with better practice scores. Better knowledge significantly predicted higher intake of fruits and vegetables. Overall knowledge and attitudes were significantly correlated with each other, but neither was significantly correlated with overall practice. These findings underscore the importance of implementing public health programs geared towards improving nutrition KAP that may lead to BC risk reduction.

Although the role of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is well-established in IBS, little data are available on its role in coeliac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite a GFD. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for studies evaluating the role of FODMAPs and/or a low-FODMAP diet in coeliac patients with persistent symptoms. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 16 January 2024 for eligible full-text papers. The study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework. Results: A total of 239 records were identified, and six papers were included. Of these, four were interventional studies comparing a low-FODMAP GFD to a regular GFD for persistent symptoms in 115 total coeliac patients (two randomized controlled trials and two open-label studies). A low-FODMAP GFD for a minimum of 4 weeks was significantly more effective than a regular GFD in reducing symptoms (p < 0.05 in 3/4 studies). Dietary FODMAP content of a conventional GFD was significantly lower than that of non-coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet (both p < 0.05), especially regarding high-FODMAP grain products. However, coeliac patients consumed more servings of fruits/vegetables high in FODMAP. No relationship between FODMAP intake and persistence of symptoms was reported. Conclusions: A low-FODMAP diet may be beneficial for uncomplicated celiac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite strict adherence to a GFD.

It delves into the essential functions of fatty acids in neurodevelopment, including their contributions to neuronal membrane formation, neuroinflammatory modulation, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Despite the acknowledged importance of these nutrients, this review reveals a lack of comprehensive synthesis in current research, particularly regarding the broader spectrum of fatty acids and their optimal levels throughout childhood. By consolidating the existing knowledge and highlighting critical research gaps, such as the effects of fatty acid metabolism on neurodevelopmental disorders and the need for age-specific dietary guidelines, this study sets a foundation for future studies. This underscores the potential of nutritional strategies to significantly influence neurodevelopmental trajectories, advocating an enriched academic and clinical understanding that can inform dietary recommendations and interventions aimed at optimizing neurological health from infancy.

Given its common occurrence and the negative impact on brain development, a screening and treatment strategy that is focused on optimizing brain development in perinatal iron deficiency is necessary. Pediatric societies currently recommend a universal iron supplementation strategy for full-term and preterm infants that does not consider individual variation in body iron status and thus could lead to undertreatment or overtreatment. Moreover, the focus is on hematological normalcy and not optimal brain development. Several serum iron indices and hematological parameters in the perinatal period are associated with a risk of abnormal neurodevelopment, suggesting their potential use as biomarkers for screening and monitoring treatment in infants at risk for perinatal iron deficiency. A biomarker-based screening and treatment strategy that is focused on optimizing brain development will likely improve outcomes in perinatal iron deficiency.

However, the anti-angiogenic effects of eriocitrin are yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the anti-angiogenic effects of eriocitrin both in vitro and in vivo as well as its underlying mechanism. Anti-angiogenic effects of eriocitrin were evaluated utilizing in vitro models of angiogenesis, including inhibition of tube formation, and induction of apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay in chick embryos was also performed to evaluate the in vivo effects of eriocitrin on angiogenesis. Results showed significant eriocitrin effects on proliferation, tube formation, migration, and apoptosis in HUVECs. Furthermore, in vivo analysis revealed that eriocitrin significantly suppressed the formation of new blood vessels. In particular, it regulated MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and VEGFR2, inhibited the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and activated apoptosis signals such as caspase cascades. In HUVECs, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) exhibited an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis through the suppression of the signaling pathway. Therefore, eriocitrin presents potential for development into an antiangiogenic therapeutic agent.

Donor human milk (DHM) is the best alternative for feeding these babies when mother’s own milk (MOM) is not available. Recently, a patented prototype of a High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) pasteurizer adapted to a human milk bank setting showed a lesser impact on immunologic components. We designed a multicentre randomized controlled trial that investigates whether, in ELBW infants with an insufficient MOM supply, the administration of HTST pasteurized DHM reduces the incidence of confirmed catheter-associated sepsis compared to DHM pasteurized with the Holder method. From birth until 34 weeks postmenstrual age, patients included in the study received DHM, as a supplement, pasteurized by the Holder or HTST method. A total of 213 patients were randomized; 79 (HTST group) and 81 (Holder group) were included in the analysis. We found no difference in the frequency of nosocomial sepsis between the patients of the two methods—41.8% (33/79) of HTST group patients versus 45.7% (37/81) of Holder group patients, relative risk 0.91 (0.64–1.3), p = 0.62. In conclusion, when MOM is not available, supplementing during admission with DHM pasteurized by the HTST versus Holder method might not have an impact on the incidence of catheter-associated sepsis.

However, its effects on pain intensity in different types of dysmenorrhoea remain unclear. We examined whether vitamin D supplementation decreases pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhoea. The Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 30 December 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation effects on such patients were included. The primary and secondary outcomes were measured by the changes in pain intensity and rescue analgesic use, respectively. Pooled mean differences and rate ratios were calculated using a random-effect model; trial sequential analysis (TSA) was also performed. Overall, 11 studies involving 687 participants were included. Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhoea compared with controls (pooled mean difference, −1.64; 95% confidence interval, −2.27 to −1.00; p < 0.001; CoE, moderate; I2 statistic, 79.43%) and indicated substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. TSA revealed that the current RCTs provide sufficient information. In subgroup analyses, vitamin D supplement reduced primary dysmenorrhoea pain but not secondary dysmenorrhoea pain. In conclusion, although substantial heterogeneity persists, vitamin D supplementation decreased pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhea, especially in those with primary dysmenorrhoea.

This ultimately leads to cardiac cachexia, which worsens the patient’s prognosis. We aimed to assess the correlation between nutritional status, assessed using the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, and the rate of major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE). Methods: The present investigation was a non-randomized, prospective, observational study in which 108 patients with acute myocardial infarction were included. Nutritional status was assessed using the CONUT score. Based on the CONUT score, the patients were divided as follows: Group 1—normal or mild nutritional status (CONUT < 3 points, n = 76), and Group 2—moderate to severe nutritional deficiency (CONUT ≥ 3 points, n = 32). Demographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters were obtained for all patients, as well as the MACE rate at 1 and 3 months of follow-up. Results: The MACE occurred more frequently in patients with impaired nutritional status at both 1-month follow-up (46.9% versus 9.2%; p < 0.0001) and 3-month follow-up (68.8% versus 10.5%; p < 0.0001). In terms of cardiovascular events, patients with poor nutritional status, with a CONUT score ≥ 3, presented more frequent non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure, and ventricular arrhythmia. Also, the number of cardiovascular deaths was higher in the undernourished group. Conclusions: This study found that patients with poor nutritional status experienced inflammatory status, frailty, and cardiovascular events more often than those with normal nutritional status at 1-month and 3-month follow-up after an acute myocardial infarction.

Efforts to identify preventive measures starting from pregnancy have recently intensified. This review aims to provide an overview of the role of maternal factors in food allergy prevention. Several studies indicate that avoiding food allergens during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of developing food allergies. International guidelines unanimously discourage avoidance diets due to potential adverse effects on essential nutrient intake and overall health for both women and children. Research on probiotics and prebiotics during pregnancy as preventive measures is promising, though evidence remains limited. Consequently, guidelines lack specific recommendations for their use in preventing food allergies.

This study evaluated the impact of RES on intestinal uric acid metabolism in mice with HUA induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, we revealed the underlying mechanism through metagenomics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and 16S ribosomal RNA analysis. We demonstrated that RES reduced the serum uric acid, creatinine, urea nitrogen, and urinary protein levels, and improved the glomerular atrophy, unclear renal tubule structure, fibrosis, and renal inflammation. The results also showed that RES increased intestinal uric acid degradation. RES significantly changed the intestinal flora composition of HFD-fed mice by enriching the beneficial bacteria that degrade uric acid, reducing harmful bacteria that promote inflammation, and improving microbial function via the upregulation of purine metabolism. The FMT results further showed that the intestinal microbiota is essential for the effect of RES on HUA, and that Lactobacillus may play a key role in this process. The present study demonstrated that RES alleviates HFD-induced HUA and renal injury by regulating the gut microbiota composition and the metabolism of uric acid.

Table sugar is one of the main dietary sources of free sugars; however, the amount added by Brazilian consumers in their culinary preparations is unknown. The aims were to estimate the daily intake of table sugar (g/day), its contribution to total energy intake (E%) and the main food groups that contribute to the intake of this sugar in a nationwide multi-ethnic sample of Brazilian adults (2017–2018 Brazilian National Dietary Survey). Based on two 24-h recalls adjusted for the within-person variation, the overall median table sugar intake was 14.3 g/day, corresponding to 3.2 E%. Males, individuals living in rural areas, with low income, low education and experiencing food insecurity had a higher intake of table sugar. The main food sources of table sugar were coffee (55.8%), juice (33.9%), milk-based preparations and smoothies (3.1%), powdered and processed juice (2.7%), whole milk (1.9%), and tea (1.6%). There are no recommendations regarding the limit of table sugar intake, but considering that the WHO limits the intake of free sugars to <10 E%, it is concluded that table sugar intake by Brazilians corresponds to about 30% of the upper recommended daily intake of free sugars.

Mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds present in meat dishes include, among others, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). These compounds can cause the development of gastrointestinal cancer. Oral cancer is one of the world’s research priorities due to the ever-increasing incidence rate. However, the effect of diet on oral cancer is still a poorly recognized issue. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the risk of oral cancer and dietary ingredients with a particular emphasis on red meat and thermally processed meat. This study was conducted among patients with oral cancer in 2022 and 2023. The shortened standardized Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a multivariate regression statistical analysis were used. The high consumption of red meat in general and thermally processed meat, especially smoked, fried, roasted and boiled, increases the risk of oral cavity cancer. Limiting the consumption of meat products and modifying the methods of preparing meat dishes may reduce exposure to carcinogenic compounds from the diet and thus reduce the risk of developing oral cancer.

This study aims to assess the efficacy of combined antibiotic therapy, herbal supplements, probiotics, and dietary modifications in SIBO management. A total of 179 SIBO-diagnosed patients underwent clinical evaluation and breath testing. Patients were categorized into hydrogen (H2-SIBO) and methane (CH4-SIBO) groups. The control group received standard antibiotic therapy and a low-FODMAP diet, while the intervention group received additional herbal antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics. After treatment, both groups exhibited reduced gas levels, particularly in CH4-SIBO. Clinical remission rates were higher in the intervention group, especially in CH4-SIBO cases. Logistic regression analysis showed gas concentrations at diagnosis as significant predictors of treatment success. In conclusion, adjunctive herbal supplements and probiotics did not significantly impact gas levels, but showed potential for clinical improvement, especially in CH4-SIBO.

Unhealthy diets influence the development of these pathologies. The Mediterranean diet can be an important part in the treatment of these diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a program that aims to increase adherence to the Mediterranean diet on the improvement of different cardiometabolic risk parameters. Methods: A prospective intervention study was carried out on 7034 Spanish workers. Prior to the intervention, 22 cardiometabolic risk scales were evaluated. Participants in this study were informed both orally and in writing of the characteristics and benefits of the Mediterranean diet and were given the website of the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare of Spain, which provides advice on nutrition. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was reinforced by sending a monthly SMS to their mobile phones. After six months of follow-up, the 22 risk scales were re-evaluated to assess changes. Means and standard deviations were calculated using Student’s t test to analyse quantitative variables. Prevalence was calculated using the Chi-square test when the variables were qualitative. Results: All the cardiometabolic risk scales studied decreased after implementing a program to improve and enhance adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The number of losses in the sample was very low, standing at 4.31%. Conclusions: The Mediterranean diet is effective in reducing all cardiovascular risk scales evaluated. The mean values and prevalence of high values of the different cardiometabolic risk scales analysed led to lower values after the implementation of the program to increase adherence to the Mediterranean diet. We observed a significant positive difference in metabolic age in both sexes. We have obtained a significant improvement in the insulin resistance index, especially in the SPISE-IR index, data that we have not found in previous publications. Easy access to the Internet and new information and communication technologies facilitate adherence to a diet and can reduce the number of losses.

This study aimed to clarify the environmental factors during infancy and their association with vegetable preference in school-aged children. To find clusters of early childhood environmental factors, we conducted a factor analysis on 58 items related to early childhood environmental factors and a k-means cluster analysis using the factors obtained. The association of the extracted factors and clusters with vegetable preferences was assessed by multiple regression analysis. Twelve factors relating to vegetable eating, cooking and harvesting experience, and parental attitudes were extracted by factor analysis. Three clusters, “low awareness of experiences”, “high awareness” and “low positive encouragement”, were then extracted. In the multiple regression analysis, all 12 factors were found to be associated with vegetable preferences. Furthermore, it was found that the “high awareness” group had a significantly higher score for vegetable preference than the “low awareness of experiences” group (β = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37–0.74). Thus, the study found that environmental factors during infancy, in isolation and combination, influenced vegetable preferences in school-aged children. Assessing the combination of various environmental factors during infancy may contribute to a better understanding of future vegetable preferences.

The variability in responses to soy has been partly attributed to differences in the metabolism of soy isoflavones, compounds with structural similarities to estrogen. Approximately one-third of humans possess gut bacteria capable of converting soy isoflavone daidzein into equol, a metabolite produced exclusively by gut microbiota with significant estrogenic potency. In contrast, lab-raised rodents are efficient equol producers, except for those raised germ-free. This discrepancy raises concerns about the applicability of traditional rodent models to humans. Herein, we designed a gnotobiotic mouse model to differentiate between equol producers and non-producers by introducing synthetic bacterial communities with and without the equol-producing capacity into female and male germ-free mice. These gnotobiotic mice display equol-producing phenotypes consistent with the capacity of the gut microbiota received. Our findings confirm the model’s efficacy in mimicking human equol production capacity, offering a promising tool for future studies to explore the relationship between endogenous equol production and health outcomes like cardiometabolic health and fertility. This approach aims to refine dietary guidelines by considering individual microbiome differences.

Despite the efforts and the recent advancement in research, FM pathogenesis and effective treatment remain unknown. Recently, the possible role of dietary patterns and/or components has been gaining attention. The current study aimed to investigate a potential correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and FM severity in a sample of Italian FM patients. An online survey was designed, composed of customized questions and validated questionnaires with the aim of investigating the intensity and type of pain, the presence of other psychophysical symptoms, the overall impact of FM, general food and lifestyle habits, and adherence to the MedDiet. The collected responses were analyzed for descriptive statistics, linear regression, and propensity score analyses. The results show that, despite considerable use of pharmaceuticals and supplements, FM participants suffered from a high-severity grade disease. However, those with good adherence to the MedDiet experienced a lower pain intensity and overall FM impact. A propensity score analysis indicates a positive influence of the MedDiet against FM severity, thus unveiling the need for well-designed intervention studies to evaluate the therapeutic potential of different dietary patterns.

In this research, we delve into the intricate area of microbial endocrinology by exploring the dynamic oscillations in neurotransmitter levels within plasma and brain samples. Our experimental model involved inducing hyperthyroidism in mice after a “probiotic load” timeframe using two strains of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii, and their combination). These probiotic interventions continued throughout the experiment and were intended to uncover potential modulatory effects on neurotransmitter levels and discern if certain probiotic strains exhibit any protection from hyperthyroidism. Moreover, we aimed to outline the eventual connections between the gut microbiota and the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. As our study reveals, there are significant fluctuations in crucial neurotransmitters within the hyperthyroidism model, related to the specific probiotic strain or combination. These findings could support future therapeutic approaches, help healthcare professionals choose between different probiotic therapies, and also allow us proceed with caution when administering such treatments, depending on the health status of hyperthyroid patients.

This study assessed the effect of two cachectic-producing tumor types on the gut microbiota to determine if a similar dysbiosis could be found. In addition, it was determined if a diet containing an immunonutrient-rich food (walnuts) known to promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the colon could alter the dysbiosis and slow cachexia. Male Fisher 344 rats were randomly assigned to a semi-purified diet with or without walnuts. Then, within each diet group, rats were further assigned randomly to a treatment group: tumor-bearing ad libitum fed (TB), non-tumor-bearing ad libitum fed (NTB-AL), and non-tumor-bearing group pair-fed to the TB (NTB-PF). The TB group was implanted either with the Ward colon carcinoma or MCA-induced sarcoma, both transplantable tumor lines. Fecal samples were collected after the development of cachexia, and bacteria species were identified using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Both TB groups developed cachexia but had a differently altered gut microbiome. Beta diversity was unaffected by treatment (NTB-AL, TB, and NTB-PF) regardless of tumor type but was affected by diet. Also, diet consistently changed the relative abundance of several bacteria taxa, while treatment and tumor type did not. The control diet increased the abundance of A. Anaeroplasma, while the walnut diet increased the genus Ruminococcus. There were no common fecal bacterial changes characteristic of cachexia found. Diet consistently changed the gut microbiota, but these changes were insufficient to slow the progression of cachexia, suggesting cancer cachexia is more complex than a few gut microbiota shifts.

It is becoming clear that dietary patterns and specific nutrients play an important role in cognition and behavior, including those related to aggression, violence, and antisocial activity. Included in this expanding knowledge base is the recognition that folate, through multiple pathways, including enzymatic reactions and gut microbiome ecology, plays a critical role in central nervous system functioning. These mechanistic advances allow for a retrospective analysis of a topic that remains unexplained—the sudden and unpredicted drop in homicide and other violent crime rates in the United States and other nations in the 1990s. Here, we revisit this marked reduction in homicide rates through the lens of the coincident public health campaign (and subsequent mandatory fortification) to increase folic acid intake. Based on objectively measured blood folate levels through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, there is little doubt that tissue folate witnessed a dramatic rise at the national level from 1988 through 2000. Drawing from accumulated and emerging research on the neurobehavioral aspects of folate, it is our contention that this relatively sudden and massive increase in tissue folate levels may have contributed to reductions in violent crime in the United States.

Methods: An RCT was undertaken in healthy Chinese primiparous mother–infant pairs (340/7–376/7gestation weeks). Mothers were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG, listening to relaxation meditation) or the control group (CG). Outcomes were the differences in microbiome composition and the diversity in the maternal gut, breast milk, and infant gut at 1 (baseline) and 8 weeks (post-intervention) between IG and CG, assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal and breastmilk samples. Results: In total, 38 mother–infant pairs were included in this analysis (IG = 19, CG = 19). The overall microbiome community structure in the maternal gut was significantly different between the IG and CG at 1 week, with the difference being more significant at 8 weeks (Bray–Curtis distance R2 = 0.04 vs. R2 = 0.13). Post-intervention, a significantly lower α-diversity was observed in IG breast milk (observed features: CG = 295 vs. IG = 255, p = 0.032); the Bifidobacterium genera presented a higher relative abundance. A significantly higher α-diversity was observed in IG infant gut (observed features: CG = 73 vs. IG = 113, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the microbiome might mediate observed relaxation intervention effects via gut–brain axis and entero-mammary pathways; but confirmation is required.

In this context, nutrition, a critical aspect of public health, is no exception to the fields influenced by the integration of AI technology. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the current landscape of AI in nutrition, providing a deep understanding of the potential of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in nutrition sciences and highlighting eventual challenges and futuristic directions. A hybrid approach from the systematic literature review (SLR) guidelines and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was adopted to systematically analyze the scientific literature from a search of major databases on artificial intelligence in nutrition sciences. A rigorous study selection was conducted using the most appropriate eligibility criteria, followed by a methodological quality assessment ensuring the robustness of the included studies. This review identifies several AI applications in nutrition, spanning smart and personalized nutrition, dietary assessment, food recognition and tracking, predictive modeling for disease prevention, and disease diagnosis and monitoring. The selected studies demonstrated the versatility of machine learning and deep learning techniques in handling complex relationships within nutritional datasets. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI applications in nutrition sciences and identifies challenges and opportunities. With the rapid advancement in AI, its integration into nutrition holds significant promise to enhance individual nutritional outcomes and optimize dietary recommendations. Researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals can utilize this research to design future projects and support evidence-based decision-making in AI for nutrition and dietary guidance.

Participants viewed a product under three labeling conditions (control, “ultraprocessed” label, and “ultraprocessed” plus “high in sugar” label) in random order for a single product. The “ultraprocessed” label led participants to report thinking more about the risks of eating the product and discouraging them from wanting to buy the product more than the control, despite not grabbing more attention than the control. The “ultraprocessed” plus “high in sugar” labels grabbed more attention, led participants to think more about the risks of eating the product, and discouraged them from wanting to buy the product more than the “ultraprocessed” label alone. “Ultraprocessed” labels may constitute promising messages that could work in tandem with nutrient labels, and further research should examine how they would influence consumers’ actual intentions and behaviors.

This review highlights the multifaceted impact of bariatric surgery beyond mere physical restriction or nutrient malabsorption, underscoring the importance of the gut microbiome and neurohormonal signals in mediating the profound effects on weight loss and behavior modification. The various bariatric surgery procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), act through distinct mechanisms to alter the gut microbiome, subsequently impacting metabolic health, energy balance, and food reward behaviors. Emerging evidence has shown that bariatric surgery induces profound changes in the composition of the gut microbiome, notably altering the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and enhancing populations of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia. These microbiota shifts have far-reaching effects beyond gut health, influencing dopamine-mediated reward pathways in the brain and modulating the secretion and action of key gut hormones including ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, and CCK. The resultant changes in dopamine signaling and hormone levels contribute to reduced hedonic eating, enhanced satiety, and improved metabolic outcomes. Further, post-bariatric surgical effects on satiation targets are in part mediated by metabolic byproducts of gut microbiota like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, which play a pivotal role in modulating metabolism and energy expenditure and reducing obesity-associated inflammation, as well as influencing food reward pathways, potentially contributing to the regulation of body weight and reduction in hedonic eating behaviors. Overall, a better understanding of these mechanisms opens the door to developing non-surgical interventions that replicate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on the gut microbiome, dopamine signaling, and gut hormone regulation, offering new avenues for obesity treatment.

Emerging research suggests that exercise modulates the abundance and functionality of gut bacteria, yet the comprehensive effects on GM diversity remain to be synthesized. Objectives and Design: The study aims to quantitatively examine the effect of exercise on the diversity of gut microbiota of adults using a systemic review and meta-analysis approach. Methods: PubMed, Ebsco, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched from their inception to September 2023. Exercise intervention studies with a control group that describe and compare the composition of GM in adults, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, were included in this meta-analysis. Results: A total of 25 studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 1044 participants. Based on a fixed-effects model [Chi2 = 29.40, df = 20 (p = 0.08); I2 = 32%], the pooled analysis showed that compared with the control group, exercise intervention can significantly increase the alpha diversity of adult GM, using the Shannon index as an example [WMD = 0.05, 95% CI (0.00, 0.09); Z = 1.99 (p = 0.05)]. In addition, exercise interventions were found to significantly alter GM, notably decreasing Bacteroidetes and increasing Firmicutes, indicating a shift in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. The subgroup analysis indicates that females and older adults appear to exhibit more significant changes in the Shannon Index and observed OTUs. Conclusions: Exercise may be a promising way to improve GM in adults. In particular, the Shannon index was significantly increased after exercise. Distinct responses in GM diversity to exercise interventions based on gender and age implicated that more research was needed.

Several studies have demonstrated the association between nutritional status and the risk of a negative health outcome after fractures. In this systematic review, we evaluated the association between malnutrition and mortality, changes in mobility/living arrangements, and postoperative complications, such as delirium, in older patients with hip fractures. A literature search on the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, up to September 2023, was conducted to identify all studies involving older subjects that reported an association between MNA/GNRI/PNI/CONUT and health outcome after hip fracture. Meta-analysis was performed by a random-effects model using risk values (RR, OR, and HR) extracted from the 14 eligible selected studies. Malnutrition significantly increased the risk of any analyzed adverse outcome by 70% at 1 month, and up to 250% at 1 year. Malnutrition significantly increased delirium risk by 275% (OR = 2.75; 95% CI 1.80–4.18; p ≤ 0.05), mortality risk by 342% (OR = 3.42; 95% CI 2.14–5.48; p ≤ 0.05), mortality hazard risk by 351% (HR = 3.51; 95% CI 1.63–7.55; p ≤ 0.05) at 1 month, and transfer-to-more-supported-living-arrangements risk by 218% (OR = 2.18; 95% CI 1.58–3.01; p ≤ 0.05), and declined mobility risk by 41% (OR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.14–1.75; p ≤ 0.05), mortality risk by 368% (OR = 3.68; 95% CI 3.00–4.52; p ≤ 0.05), and mortality hazard risk by 234% (HR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.91–2.87; p ≤ 0.05) at 1 year. Malnutrition of older patients increases the risk of death and worsens mobility and independence after hip fractures. The results of the present study highlight the importance of nutritional status evaluation of older subjects with hip fractures in order to prevent potential adverse outcomes (Registration No: CRD42023468751).

This was a retrospective cohort study of all adults with Class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) who enrolled in the WMP from March 2018 to June 2021. The participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short Version (EDE-QS), Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale, and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) at baseline and 12-month follow-up. A total of 115 patients completed 12 months in the WMP and were included in the study, with 76.5% being female, a mean ± SD age at baseline of 51.3 ± 13.8 years, a weight of 146 ± 26 kg, and a BMI of 51.1 ± 8.6 kg/m2. The participants lost an average of 8.6 ± 0.2 kg over 12 months, and greater weight loss at follow-up was significantly associated with improved global EDE-QS scores, psychological distress, and improved mental health quality of life. However, improvements in most mental health outcomes were not predicted by weight loss alone. Notably, a lower eating disorder risk at baseline was associated with less psychological distress at follow-up and greater weight loss at follow-up. Our results also found an association between reduced psychological distress and reduced binge eating frequency. These findings support the inclusion components of obesity interventions that target the psychological correlates of obesity to support improved outcomes in people with Class 3 obesity. Future studies should aim to identify which aspects of the WMP helped improve people’s psychological outcomes.

The secondary objective was to establish the variables associated with plasma PS concentrations in adults. Participants completed a dietary habit questionnaire and a blood sample was collected to obtain the following variables: campesterol, sitosterol, sitostanol, lanosterol, stigmasterol, biochemical parameters, and the SNVs. In addition, biometric and demographic variables were also recorded. In the generalized linear model, cholesterol and age were positively associated with total PS levels, while BMI was negatively related. For rs4245791, homozygous T allele individuals showed a significantly lower campesterol concentration compared with C homozygotes, and the GG alleles of rs657152 had the lowest levels of campesterol compared with the other alleles of the SNV. Conclusions: The screening of certain SNVs could help prevent the increase in plasma PS and maybe PNALD in some patients. However, further studies on the determinants of plasma phytosterol concentrations are needed.
