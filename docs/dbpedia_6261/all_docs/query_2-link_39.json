        "text": "Hello to all,\n\nHere I create this topic to bounce a little on the topic made by @Tom Stevens but also @Perú FC , and other topics that we could see since the beginning.\n\nThe concept is simple and I hope you will like it.\n\nThe objective is to establish the Ballon d'Or award according to us, the users of the BigSoccer forum, and thus to be a panel of voters, a new jury in a way.\n\nTo come back to the rules, the ones I'm going to state are the ones you'll have to follow in your judgement on the attribution of the best players of each year.\n\nThe criteria for awarding the Ballon d'Or are the same as they are now, in order of priority:\n\n1 - the player's performances (individual and collective) during the CIVIL year, his record of achievements\n\n2 - His class (talent and fair play)\n\n3 - His career and charisma\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that a minimum of subjectivity comes out of the votes that this new list, nevertheless I ask you to try to be as objective as possible, and to be as close as possible to the spirit of the Ballon d'Or, which mixes both the performances of the player, of his team but also of the big competitions, I think especially of the World Cup, but also his weight from a point of charisma, and other things that remain in this spirit.\n\nThe objective is to try to get as close as possible to what the Ballon d'Or would have been if the South Americans had been eligible by example.\n\nMoreover, I propose that we leave two or three weeks to see the reactions of everyone for each year and important thing: a user has the right to one answer for his vote.\n\nIMPORTANT : That is to say that if someone changes his vote in a new post, this one will not be compatible and only the first one will count in the vote, then take time if it is necessary but think well.\n\nSo, you will rank your top 5 for each year, following the list of 23 players listed by @Perú FC and @Tom Stevens .\n\nEach player listed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place will be awarded respectively: 6 points, 4 points, 3 points, 2 points and 1 point, like the current Ballon d'Or.\n\nWe will update you in a couple of weeks.\n\nPlease take your time before posting your top 5 because only the first comment will be counted in the votes.\n\nSUM UP : In short, try to be as objective and close to the spirit of the Ballon d'Or as possible, also trying to take into account the different periods of the football era and the imprint of some players on their time.\n\nIt's more a list of what could have been rather than what we would have liked to be.\n\nAnyway, I thank you for your understanding, I hope you will like the concept and especially long live football !\n\nBest,\n\nIceBlood34.\n\nInteresting topic mate, and your first post has a lot of thought put into it and is explained well I think.\n\nSo I can start my contributions in the 1990s (I hope it is ok to make a random start - this selection takes the least consideration for me probably, being a time I was alive and following football pretty closely, and a time it's possible to review well too with videos, various written sources, national awards etc).\n\nI have simply put 1st to 5th placed votes within the text I am quoting, and I am aiming to stick by the traditional spirit of voting, while making it my personal vote still, based on my best impressions. I would say that I'd be a voter that wouldn't really factor in team achievements strongly by default, but for sure I'm considering if a player contributes significantly on a big stage then that goes in his favour a lot. I also wonder to what extent former winners and well placed players from previous years might get held back a bit as time goes on (so as not to continually reward the same players) but as I think you are not prohibiting repeat wins or anything I wouldn't be seeing that as a big factor, but maybe just a 'benefit of the doubt' consideration on tie-break kind of situations, that might lean towards new players coming into the fray.\n\nI'm trying to make it very much calendar/civil year based indeed, although I guess in certain situations the season that ended in the year concerned might take precedence to a small extent (at least the part of it that is in the calendar year, but maybe even the whole of it in a general sense, just in terms of the achievements and pattern of form...but yeah mostly I am voting based on full calendar year).\n\nThe only problem I can think of is that the player lists from Tom and Peru are I think based predominantly on seasons, not calendar years though, but these votes can stand if the player lists also stand anyway. A big example though is that I think I'd vote for Ronaldo Nazario as Player of 1996 calendar/civil year. Perhaps I'd consider Savicevic for top five of 1994 or something like that (I'd have to think about it - it's just an example), but the significant one is probably Ronaldo as I guess a lot of people would have him up there somewhere...and it also means I placed Weah first twice.\n\nIn terms of the issue of using the shortlists (which were compiled based on seasons from European summer to European summer, although considering calendar year seasons as commonly played in South America on a calendar year basis - I think Tom's idea was more of a 'retrospective' season to season comparison rather than a real-time vote scenario originally), if we were allowed to vote for players outside that (like wm442433 did and I think it's fair enough and makes sense he fully uses his ideas already in place - I guess IceBlood is aiming to simulate a modern Ballon d'Or including the use of shortlists to vote from, although for most of the years of the Ballon d'Or there was actually free choice for the journalists of course anyway), I would confirm that for the 80s and 90s selections I would just add in Ronaldo Nazario for 1996 (but after thinking about it and the Ballon d'Or criteria with full calendar year emphasis, I will say in 2nd place anyway, with Weah retaining the 1st place vote, even though I've put him top for 1995 too, he won the FIFA award and Ballon d'Or in reality that year and he'd be a major candidate to win our vote for that year perhaps, albeit it could end like the World Soccer vote where he didn't win and actually got a higher placing and percentage of that vote for 1996 indeed), and Savicevic for 1994 (I will place him in the final 5th place, the same as I did for 1995 for slightly different reasons).\n\nThere could be other choices that would be in mind as possibilities and/or I previously came up with for inclusion among the best players of certain calendar years, including some that wm442433 did include like Butragueno in 1987 and Stojkovic in 1988, but others like Hoddle in 1981 and Laudrup in 1985 too, but on balance I'd think they are borderline and/or left-field choices, and leaning towards aligning to Ballon d'Or criteria as set out by IceBlood would make me doubt them more if anything considering the candidates already chosen, as might trying to avoid favouritism (not that votes would be free of that in general in reality too, at least in terms of players particular voters particularly appreciated and/or rated as players). I would see them more as possibly getting some honourable mention in any write-up of choices, as near misses, like Laudrup himself for 1986 or Raul for 1997 for example (or players such as Litmanen and Batistuta for 1996).\n\nIf in the end the Ronaldo inclusion is determined to be ok (if a new amended shortlist for 1996 is created for example) and the Savicevic one not (if he still wasn't on an amended 1994 shortlist) then no problem, I can just add in Ronaldo. Potentially Klinsmann drops out of the 1994 list (which possibly fits well with somewhat of the benefit of the doubt with the 1995 placing), and Del Piero out of the 1996 list anyway.\n\nI suppose it's at least understandable to factor in a little bit performances/form from the very end of the previous calendar year (even if trying to factor in as much as possible from the calendar year concerned, but especially if that's not possible due to voting date). I guess that's necessary to justify my placings for Elkjaer in 1986 or Sammer in 1996 for example (though in Elkjaer's case, I shouldn't be double counting after including for 1985 too - I feel like I'm pretty convinced on doing that though even if taking out the very last days of 1985 maybe); on the other hand both of them have significant performances in the major summer tournaments (World Cup 1986 and Euro 96), and aligning with the Ballon d'Or guidelines would mean that weighed quite heavily, and that probably shows in the actual Ballon d'Or results from the time.\n\nContinuing on this just a little bit.\n\nIn 1981, for instance (Hoddle) : in the combined seasonal (for Europe) + calendar (for South America) lists, there's no less than 3 players of Dinamo Tbilissi, a certain Paulo Isodoro who represent Brazil him too (domestic player of the year + toured in Europe with the NT) and a couple of other selections who don't win hands down against other possible inclusions.\n\nSo here's a grey area that permits, imo, to vote for anybody we want, or say a player who received at least one vote somewhere (that is in France Football, World Soccer, Mundo Deportivo Venezuela, Onze/ Onze Mondial etc.).\n\nThen, there's another grey area between the players who received only one vote and the ones who received nothing but some players with 2 or 3 or 4 votes are in question too. And there are the Toty's too and anything we think they fell short to make or were undeseverdly sidelined (in 1981, 3 players of Ipswich Town make up the PFA PoY podium).\n\nThe grey area is vast."
