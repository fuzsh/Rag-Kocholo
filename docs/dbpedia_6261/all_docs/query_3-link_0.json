        "text": "Mass Appeal\n\nThe Paris Games signalled the acceptance of the Games as a major event with widespread appeal. The number of participating National Olympic Committees jumped from 29 to 44. This newfound popularity was confirmed by the presence of over 1,000 journalists.\n\nClosing Ceremony\n\nThese Games introduced the Closing Ceremony ritual as we know it today. This involves the raising of three flags: the flag of the International Olympic Committee, the flag of the host nation and the flag of the next host nation.\n\nNo Time to Lose\n\nFinnish runner Paavo Nurmi won five gold medals to add to the three he had won in 1920. His most spectacular performance occurred on 10 July. First, he easily won the 1500m and then, a mere 55 minutes later, he returned to the track to win the 5,000m.\n\nHollywood Material\n\nAmerican swimmer Johnny Weissmuller won three golds. He claimed two further golds at the 1928 Games and went on to become famous playing Tarzan of the Apes in 12 movies. The Paris Games themselves became immortalised in “Chariots of Fire”, the Oscar-winning film about principled British runner Eric Liddell by Hugh Hudson."
