        "text": "Michigan in the Olympics\n\n1924 - Paris\n\nWilliam DeHart Hubbard, Michigan's three time Big 10 champion in the long jump and two time 100 yard dash champ, became the first Black athlete to win an individual gold medal. His winning long jump of 24 ft.- 5 inches was somewhat overshadowed by the performance of U.S. teammate John Legendre the day before. Legendre, who had failed to make the squad as a long jumper, set a world record with a 25 ft.- 5.75 inch leap while competing in the pentathlon. Hubbard closed out his U of M career in 1925 with a series of spectacular performances. He tied the world records in the 60 and 100 yard dashes. In his final appearance as a Wolverine, Hubbard broke Legendre's long jump world record with a leap of 25 ft.-10.85 inches.\n\nJames Brooker, 1924 Big Ten pole vault champion, brought home a bronze medal in the pole vault. Brooker finished in a tie for third place with a Dane, but won a jump off to give the U.S. a sweep in the pole vault competition At the U.S. trials Brooker finished in a four-way tie for first at 13 feet. None of the Americans could match that at Paris. George \"Buck\" Hester, a sprinter on U- M's 1924 freshman team, competed for Canada in the 100 and 200 meter races, and the 4x100 meter relay, advancing to the semi-finals in each event.\n\nWilliam DeHart Hubbard, James Brooker, George \"Buck\" Hester\n\nEighteen Michigan track men took part in the Midwest Olympic tryouts held at Ferry Field. Freshman Victor B. Leschinsky won the 200 meter race in what was claimed to be a world record 21.4 seconds. He failed to make the U.S. team at the New Haven trials however. U-M track coach Steve Farrell served as an assistant coach for the U.S. team in Paris.\n\nVictor Leschinsky, center, wins 200 m. at Midwest Trials at Ferry Field\n\nHenry Jamison \"Jam\" Handy won a bronze medal with the U.S. water polo team which was made up of the Illinois Athletic Club, including Johnny Weissmuller. Handy's first Olympic appearance was in 1904 in St. Louis where he won a bronze medal in the 400 yard breaststroke.\n\nBrooker and Hubbard competing in Paris, Coach Steve Farrell\n\nThe U-M Results-1924\n\nWilliam DeHart Hubbard long jump 1st, 24 ft. 6 in. hop, skip and jumpeliminated in trials James Brooker pole vault3rd George \"Buck\" Hester (Canada) 100 metersdid not place 200 metersdid not place 4x100m relaydid not place Henry Jamison\"Jam\" Handy water polo3rd\n\nPhoto Credits:\n\nWilliam DeHart Hubbard, long jump, copy print from 1925 Michiganensian, in Ath.
