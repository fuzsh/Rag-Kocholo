This method is called the κ-model. The main idea is to maintain the form of the usual physical laws, especially Newton’s laws of motion when gravity is weak, but only by applying a local scaling procedure for the related lengths, distances, and velocities. This local scaling appears as a correspondence principle in the κ-model. In this model, the fundamental physical constants remain universal, i.e., they are independent of a point in space and of time. The κ-model is Newtonian in its essence, but there is a relativistic extension that can easily be built. The aim of the present paper is to detail the mathematical formalism supporting it.

This paper presents a novel method of traffic forecasting that incorporates parameters related to road symmetry into a Graph Convolution Network model. Our model is crafted to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in road conditions, including the presence of symmetric and asymmetric road layouts, which substantially influence traffic flow. We have developed a GCN model that not only accounts for standard traffic flow metrics but also integrates a matrix representing road symmetry. The model undergoes training and validation on the METR-LA dataset, showcasing a significant enhancement in prediction accuracy. In the comparative analysis of state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrated a significant enhancement in performance, achieving 30.68% improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a 24.28% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over the best-performing method. The implications of our research are profound for urban planners, traffic management systems, and navigation service providers, as it offers a more dependable tool for forecasting traffic conditions, aiding in road design, and refining route planning strategies based on the symmetry of road networks.

This study introduces the Advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Enhanced Contextual Fusion and Robustness (AMSA-ECFR) framework, addressing the critical challenge of data sparsity in multimodal sentiment analysis. The main components of the proposed approach include a Transformer-based model employing BERT for deep semantic analysis of textual data, coupled with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for encoding temporal acoustic features. Innovations in AMSA-ECFR encompass advanced feature encoding for temporal dynamics and an adaptive attention-based model for efficient cross-modal integration, achieving symmetry in the fusion and alignment of asynchronous multimodal data streams. Additionally, the framework employs generative models for intelligent approximation of missing features. It ensures robust alignment of high-level features with multimodal data context, effectively tackling issues of incomplete or noisy inputs. In simulation studies, the AMSA-ECFR model demonstrated superior performance against existing approaches. The symmetrical approach to feature integration and data alignment contributed significantly to the model’s robustness and precision. In simulations, the AMSA-ECFR model demonstrated a 10% higher accuracy and a 15% lower mean absolute error than the current best multimodal sentiment analysis frameworks.

Our methodology centers on establishing multiple theorems that introduce innovative conditions to guarantee that there are no positive solutions to the examined equation. Due to the symmetry between non-oscillatory solutions, we obtain oscillation conditions by excluding only positive solutions. We employ the Riccati technique in various ways to achieve this objective. The criteria presented in this study complement and generalize many findings published in the literature.

Besides the importance of equations of the neutral type, studying the qualitative behavior of solutions to these equations is rich in analytical points and interesting issues. We begin by finding the monotonic features of positive solutions. The new properties contribute to obtaining new and improved relationships between x and z for use in studying oscillatory behavior. We present new conditions that exclude the existence of positive solutions to the examined equation, and then we establish oscillation criteria through the symmetry property between non-oscillatory solutions. We use the generalized Riccati substitution method, which enables us to apply the results to a larger area than the special cases of the considered equation. The new results essentially improve and extend previous results in the literature. We support this claim by applying the results to an example and comparing them with previous findings. Moreover, the reduction of our results to Euler’s differential equation introduces the well-known sharp oscillation criterion.

The authors investigate the interplay between the ring-theoretic properties of a ring R and the associated compressed zero-divisor graph. An undirected graph consisting of a vertex set Z(RE)\\{[0]}=RE\\{[0],[1]}, where RE={[x]:x∈R} and [x]={y∈R:ann(x)=ann(y)} is called a compressed zero-divisor graph, denoted by ΓER. An edge is formed between two vertices [x] and [y] of Z(RE) if and only if [x][y]=[xy]=[0], that is, iff xy=0. For a ring R, graph G is said to be realizable as ΓER if G is isomorphic to ΓER. We classify the rings based on Mdim of their associated CZDGs and obtain the bounds for the Mdim of the compressed zero-divisor graphs. We also study the Mdim of realizable graphs of rings. Moreover, some examples are provided to support our results. Notably, we discuss the interconnection between Mdim, girth, and diameter of CZDGs, elucidating their symmetrical significance.

We validated the suggested fractional epidemiological seasonal influenza model of the SVEIHR type to demonstrate the Caputo operator’s relevance. We analysed the model using fractional calculus, revealing its basic properties and enhancing our understanding of disease progression. Furthermore, the positivity, bounds, and symmetry of the numerical scheme were examined. Adjusting the Caputo fractional-order parameter α = 0.99 provided the best fit for epidemiological data on infection rates. We compared the suggested model with the Caputo fractional-order system and the integer-order equivalent model. The fractional-order model had lower absolute mean errors, suggesting that it could better represent sickness transmission and development. The results underline the relevance of using the Caputo fractional-order operator to improve epidemiological models’ precision and forecasting. Integrating fractional calculus within the framework of symmetry helps us build more reliable models that improve public health interventions and policies.

Unlike the VaR model, the expectile threshold is constructed by an asymmetric least square loss function. We construct an estimator of this new model using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) smoothing approach. The mathematical properties of the constructed estimator are stated through the establishment of the pointwise complete convergence. Additionally, we prove that the constructed estimator is uniformly consistent over the nearest neighbors (UCNN). Such asymptotic results constitute a good mathematical support of the proposed financial risk process. Thus, we examine the easy implantation of this process through an artificial and real data. Our empirical analysis confirms the superiority of the kNN-approach over the kernel method as well as the superiority of the expectile over the quantile in financial risk analysis.

The hybrid approach leverages COA’s efficient exploration mechanisms, inspired by crayfish behaviour, with the symmetry of SaDE’s adaptive exploitation capabilities, characterized by its dynamic parameter adjustment. The balance between these two phases represents a symmetrical relationship wherein both components contribute equally and complementary to the algorithm’s overall performance. This symmetry in design enables the Hybrid COASaDE to maintain consistent and robust performance across a diverse range of optimization problems. Experimental evaluations were conducted using CEC2022 and CEC2017 benchmark functions, demonstrating COASaDE’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results and statistical analyses confirm the robustness and efficiency of the Hybrid COASaDE in finding optimal solutions. Furthermore, the applicability of the Hybrid COASaDE was validated through several engineering design problems, where COASaDE outperformed other optimizers in achieving the optimal solution.

Depending on the types of symmetry lowering, various cross-correlation phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall effect, magneto-electric effect, and magneto-piezoelectric effect, emerge below the critical temperature. We revisit a close relationship between the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic structures and cross-correlations based on the augmented multipoles consisting of electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles with different spatial inversion and time-reversal parities.

Nevertheless, conventional planar superpixel generation algorithms are inadequately suited for segmenting symmetrical spherical images due to the distinctive geometric differences. In this paper, we present a novel superpixel algorithm termed context identity and contour intensity (CICI) that is specifically tailored for spherical scene segmentation. By defining a neighborhood range and regional context identity, we propose a symmetrical spherical seed-sampling method to optimize both the quantity and distribution of seeds, achieving evenly distributed seeds across the panoramic surface. Additionally, we integrate the contour prior to superpixel correlation measurements, which could significantly enhance boundary adherence across different scales. By implementing the two-fold optimizations on the non-iterative clustering framework, we achieve synergistic CICI to generate higher-quality superpixels. Extensive experiments on the public dataset confirm that our work outperforms the baselines and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms in terms of several quantitative metrics.

In this article, we investigate the characteristics of ideals, principal ideals, prime ideals, maximal ideals, and the smallest ideal containing any nonempty subset. By applying elementary real analysis, particularly the infimum, our main result is stated as follows: for any closed set I in BQLA, I is a nontrivial proper ideal if and only if there exists c∈(0,1] such that I=(−x,y)∈R2|cx≤y≤xcandx,y≥0. This shows that its shape has to be symmetric with the graph y=−x.

In the general case of computerized tomography, several hundreds of projections are required to obtain a single high-resolution slice of the object; in the case of discrete tomography, projections of an object made by just one homogeneous material are sums along very few angles of the pixel values, which can be thought to be 0’s or 1’s without loss of generality. Genetic algorithms are global optimization techniques with an underlying random approach and, therefore, their convergence to a solution is provided in a probabilistic sense. We present here a genetic algorithm able to straightforwardly reconstruct binary objects in the three-dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge, our methodology is the first to require no model of the shape (e.g., periodicity, convexity or symmetry) to reconstruct. Experiments were carried out to test our new approach in terms of computational time and correctness of the solutions. Over the years, discrete tomography has been studied for many interesting applications to computer vision, non-destructive reverse engineering and industrial quality control, electron microscopy, X-rays crystallography, biplane angiography, data coding and compression.

The CHN tool can be used to solve a number of ranking and optimization problems, where the equilibrium states of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) related to the CHN give the solution to any given problem. Because of the non-local characteristic of the “infinite memory” effect, fractional-order (FO) systems have been proved to describe more accurately the behavior of real dynamical systems, compared to the model’s ODE. In this paper, a fractional-order variant of a Hopfield neural network is introduced to solve a Quadratic Knap Sac Problem (QKSP), namely the fractional CHN (FRAC-CHN). Firstly, the system is integrated with the quadratic method for fractional-order equations whose trajectories have shown erratic paths and jumps to other basin attractions. To avoid these drawbacks, a new algorithm for obtaining an equilibrium point for a CHN is introduced in this paper, namely the optimal fractional CHN (OPT-FRAC-CHN). This is a variable time-step method that converges to a good local minima in just a few iterations. Compared with the non-variable time-stepping CHN method, the optimal time-stepping CHN method (OPT-CHN) and the FRAC-CHN method, the OPT-FRAC-CHN method, produce the best local minima for random CHN instances and for the optimal feeding problem.

Oscillations during material transportation, particularly at the end location, pose safety risks and prolong carrying times. The methodology involves collecting sensor data from an overhead crane system, preprocessing the data, training an LSTM-based RNN model that incorporates symmetrical features, and integrating the model into a control algorithm. The control algorithm utilizes swing angle predictions from the symmetry-enhanced LSTM-based RNN model to dynamically adjust crane motion in real time, minimizing oscillations. Symmetry in this framework refers to the balanced and consistent handling of oscillatory data, ensuring that the model can generalize better across different scenarios and load conditions. The LSTM-based RNN model accurately predicts swing angles, enabling proactive control actions to be taken. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of approximately 98.6% in swing angle prediction. This innovative approach holds promise for transforming material transportation processes in industrial settings, enhancing operational safety, and optimizing efficiency.

We discuss the solution to the problem with respect to its existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness. Using three different fractional derivative operators, the proposed model is examined. To approximate fractional-order systems, we use an efficient numerical Euler method in Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio, and Atangana–Baleanu sense. Several asymptomatic behaviors are observed in the proposed models based on these three operators. These behaviors do not appear in integer-order derivative models. These behaviors are essential for understanding fractional-order systems dynamics. Our results provide insight into fractional-order systems dynamics. These operators analyze local and global stability and Hyers–Ulam stability. Furthermore, the numerical solutions for the proposed model are simulated using the three methods.

As the proportion of renewable energy sources and power electronic equipment increases, the inertia on the power generation side decreases, highlighting the growing importance of frequency support on the load side. As it is generally believed that the active power balance of power systems determines the frequency stability, few studies have considered the effect of voltage variation on the frequency response dynamics. It is important to note that the node voltage keeps fluctuating throughout the frequency dynamic process, which affects the active power of loads and should not be neglected. Based on the aforementioned rationales, this paper endeavors to investigate the modeling of power load frequency response and analyze its support capability considering the voltage variation effect. This paper initially establishes the small-signal model of dynamic load under frequency dynamics, derives the transfer function relating active power to system frequency deviation, and subsequently develops its frequency response model. Subsequently, commencing with the ZIP model of static load, the power fluctuation of load nodes is derived from the influence of preceding nodes, and the frequency response model of the static load is formulated and its frequency support capacity is scrutinized. Based on this foundation, a comprehensive aggregation model of the complex load is constructed, and its frequency support capability is assessed using actual data. Finally, the proposed model and analysis results are validated through simulation, confirming their correctness and effectiveness.

Such polynomials have a symmetry property over the interval [−2, 0], with Gn−2,00=−1nGn−2,0(−2). An explicit formulation of an NSSG operational matrixwas constructed, which served as a powerful tool for obtaining the desired numerical solutions. Then, a modified direct computational algorithm was suggested for solving the controlled Duffing oscillator problem. The idea behind the proposed algorithm is based on using symmetry basis functions, which are important and have real-world applications in physics and engineering. The original controlled Duffing oscillator problem was transformed into a nonlinear quadratic programming problem. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical results. The numerical results emphasize that the modified proposed approach reaches the desired value of the performance index, with a few computations and with the minimum order of the NSSG basis function when compared with the other existing method, which is an important factor to consider when choosing the appropriate method in other mathematical and engineering applications.

Gauge invariance requires a conformal transformation of the metric tensor. We apply this approach, which borrows from Utiyama’s methodology, to a model with a massless scalar field and a model with a massless spinor field. We observed that for spinor models non-symmetrized Lagrangians can enable the existence of magnetic monopoles, but this is not possible with symmetrized Lagrangian. Such restrictions do not occur for spinless fields, but the model does not allow spin-one fields interacting with monopoles.

In this paper, uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, plane tension, and shear stress relaxation experiments were conducted on screen panel samples to illustrate that the third-order Ogden model and the generalized Maxwell model can accurately describe the hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity of screen panels. Then, the coupling method of finite element and discrete element was adopted to establish the simulation model of the screen panel and material group coupling system, and the dynamics of the coupling system under different loading conditions were explored. Finally, the dynamic model of the coupling system of VFFSs mass, screen panel, and material group was proposed, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II was applied to optimize the system’s dynamic response. The results reveal that the use of optimized shear springs can reduce the relative amplitude change rate of the main and floating screen frame by 44.30% while maintaining the periodic motion of the VFFSs under operation conditions, greatly enhancing the stability of the VFFSs system.

The obtained result is the approximation of the real value. Currently, there are few reports on the approximate error and applicable condition. In this paper, we study the factors related to the approximate errors according to the fractional expansions. Our research shows that the approximate errors relate not only to fractional order but also to time t, and that they increase rapidly with time t. This method can only be applied within a certain time range, and the time range is relevant to fractional order and fractional expansions. We can ascertain this time range according to the absolute error and the relative error. Many obtained achievements may be incorrect if the applicable conditions are not satisfied.

The system supports localized waves of the symbiotic type owing to the same-species repulsion and cross-species attraction. The minority BEC component moves through the majority component and creates excitations. To quantify the emerging excitations, we introduce a time-dependent function called disturbance. Through numerical simulations of the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equations with periodic boundary conditions, we have identified a critical velocity of the localized wave, above which a transition from the superfluid to dissipative regime occurs, as evidenced by a sharp increase in the disturbance function. The factors responsible for the discrepancy between the actual critical velocity and the speed of sound, expected from theoretical arguments, have been discussed.
