        "text": "As the world eagerly anticipates the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, the spotlight is shining brightly on a talented group of athletes from South Carolina.\n\nHere Are 3 South Carolina Athletes To Keep Your Eye On:\n\nThese athletes are set to make their mark on the global stage, representing the Palmetto State with pride and determination. From seasoned champions to promising newcomers, South Carolina's contingent is ready to compete and bring home the gold.\n\nCharleston's Emma Navarro: Olympic Debut in Tennis\n\nCharleston's very own Emma Navarro is gearing up for her Olympic debut. The Ashley Hall graduate and former Post and Courier All-Lowcountry player of the year has made significant strides on the WTA Tour, currently ranked No. 15. Navarro's journey to the Olympics has been nothing short of spectacular, with notable victories over former world No. 1 Naomi Osaka and current No. 2 Coco Gauff during her impressive run to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year. Team USA's tennis squad, including Navarro, Gauff, Jessica Pegula, and Danielle Collins, promises to be a formidable force in Paris.\n\nA'ja Wilson: Chasing a Second Gold Medal in Women's Basketball\n\nColumbia's A'ja Wilson, a former University of South Carolina star, is set to defend her title in women's basketball. Wilson, who played at Heathwood Hall in Columbia and led the Gamecocks to a national championship in 2017, was instrumental in Team USA's gold medal victory at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Known for her dominant presence on the court, Wilson led the team with 20 points, 2.8 blocks, and 9.3 rebounds per game in Tokyo. Having guided the Las Vegas Aces to the WNBA title last year and being named MVP of the finals, Wilson's return to the Olympics is highly anticipated.\n\nRaven Saunders: Returning Strong in Women's Shot Put\n\nCharleston's Raven Saunders is no stranger to the Olympic stage. The Burke High School graduate is making her third Olympic appearance, having previously competed in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and Tokyo in 2021, where she won a silver medal. Despite facing personal and professional challenges, including the passing of her mother during the Tokyo Games and an 18-month suspension from competition, Saunders has made a triumphant return. She secured her spot on Team USA with a season's best throw of 19.90 meters at the Olympic Trials, joining Chase Jackson and Jaida Ross in the shot put event.\n\nSouth Carolina's Olympic Lineup\n\nThe Palmetto State's representation at the Paris Olympics goes beyond these remarkable athletes, highlighting South Carolina's rich athletic talent. The Olympics, running from July 26 to August 11, promise to be an exciting and unforgettable event, with fans able to catch every moment through Peacock, NBC, USA Network, and E!."
