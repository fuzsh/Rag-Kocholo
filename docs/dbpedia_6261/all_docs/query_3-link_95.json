        "text": "The roots of track and field, or athletics, may be traced back to the first ancient Olympic Games, held in 776 B.C. in the valley of Olympia on the southwestern coast of the Greek peninsula. The only event at those Games – the “stadion” – was a sprinting race of approximately 200 meters, or the length of the ancient Olympic stadium. Coroebus won the stadion in 776 B.C., and thus is history’s first Olympic champion. The ancient Olympic Games, held every four years, eventually grew to contain other athletics events such as the discus, javelin and the broad jump.\n\nThe marathon has its origins in the legend of the Greek soldier Pheidippides. Legend has it that in 490 B.C., following the Greeks’ victory over the Persian invaders in the Battle of Marathon, Pheidippides ran 25 miles from Marathon to Athens with news of the victory. Upon his arrival in Athens, Pheidippides called out, “Be joyful, we win!” and then collapsed and died of exhaustion. In commemoration of the messenger’s feat, a marathon race of 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) was held on the route from Marathon to Athens at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. The official marathon distance was set at 42.195 km (26 miles and 385 yards) for the 1908 London Games. There are conflicting historical accounts as to why: some say it was so that the race would begin at Windsor Castle and finish directly in front of the royal box at Olympic Stadium, while other historians say the starting point was selected to ease crowd control.\n\nAfter the end of the ancient Olympic Games (in about 393 A.D.), athletics competitions were rarely contested. The sport was revived sporadically in England between the 12th century and the 19th century. Cambridge and Oxford University contested the first university track meet in 1864, and in 1873 the first collegiate races in the U.S. were held. The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), the international governing body of the sport, was founded in 1912, and in 2001, the name of the organization was changed to the International Association of Athletics Federations. In 2019, the name was changed again, and the organization is now known as World Athletics.\n\nBefore diving into the year-by-year history, here are some quick-hitters on Olympic track and field history:\n\nWho has the most gold medals in Olympic track and field history?\n\nIndividually, it's a tie between Carl Lewis of the U.S. and Finland's Paavo Nurmi. Each of them has nine gold medals. Nurmi has the edge in overall medal count, 12 to 10.\n\nAs a nation, the U.S. owns a massive advantage in gold medals, with 328 golds and 828 overall medals. The Soviet Union is in second with 64 gold medals.\n\nWhat was the first Olympic track and field competition in history?\n\nThe first Olympic track and field competition in modern times was at the 1896 Athens Olympics, which was the resurrection of the ancient Olympics. Those took place from 776 BC to 393 AD. At the ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece, events such as sprinting, discus and long jump highlighted the track and field slate.\n\nTokyo 2020\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics brought a slew of world records to the Olympic stage, courtesy of Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela (women’s triple jump), Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the U.S. (women’s 400m hurdles) and Norwegian Karsten Warholm (men’s 400m hurdles).\n\nRojas executed a world record distance of 15.67m, breaking Inessa Kravets’ record of 15.50m, which had stood since 1995. In the men’s high jump, Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barsham and Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi shared a gold medal, making history. The two are close friends and gleefully accepted their gold medals side-by-side.\n\nIn the men’s 400m hurdles, Warholm clocked in at 45.94 seconds, breaking his own world record and edging out Rai Benjamin of the U.S. for the Olympic crown.\n\nElaine Thompson-Herah also starred, becoming the first woman to successfully execute a sprint “double-double” in back-to-back Olympics. The Jamaican legend won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m.\n\nIn spite of excellence from McLaughlin-Levrone and Athing Mu among others, Tokyo 2020 proved disappointing for the U.S., which failed to win an individual men’s gold medal.\n\nRio 2016\n\nEthiopia's Almaz Ayana kicked things off on the first day of competition by breaking a nearly 23-year-old world record in the women's 10,000m by more than 14 seconds. American Michelle Carter won the United States its first ever Olympic title in the women's shot put, and her compatriot, Dalilah Muhammad, later did the same in the women's 400m hurdles. American Matthew Centrowitz's surprise 1500m win was USA's first in the event since 1908. Mo Farah of Great Britain defended both his 10,000m and 5000m crowns, a consecutive double only achieved by one other man in history, the great Lasse Viren. South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk from lane eight took down Michael Johnson's elusive 400m world record. Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo dove at the line to beat American superstar Allyson Felix in the women's 400m, though Felix would still earn her fifth and sixth career Olympic golds in the 4x100m and 4x400m relays to become track and field's most successful female Olympian in history. Kenya's David Rudisha, Croatia's Sandra Perkovic, USA's Christian Taylor and Ashton Eaton all defended their golds, respectively, in the men's 800m, women's discus, men's triple jump and decathlon. During the heats of the women's 5000m, a moment of sportsmanship swept the globe when after a devastating fall, American Abbey D'Agostino and New Zealander Nikki Hamblin helped each other finish. Team USA swept the women's 100m hurdles, an Olympic first for the event. Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah and Usain Bolt doubled in the 100m and 200m – for Bolt, the third consecutive Olympics he'd accomplished the feat. Bolt and Jamaica's win in the 4x100m relay, also a third consecutive victory, tied him with legends Carl Lewis and Paavo Nurmi for the most career Olympic track and field golds with nine.\n\nLondon 2012\n\nUsain Bolt completed the \"double-triple,\" successfully defending his Olympic gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. Allyson Felix also won three Olympic gold medals, including her first individual gold in the 200m after earning silver medals in 2004 and 2008. Great Britain's Mo Farah swept the 5000m and 10,000m races in front of his home fans. Kenya's David Rudisha lived up to his nickname, \"King David,\" by breaking the 800m world record.\n\nBeijing 2008\n\nUsain Bolt of Jamaica broke three world records at the Games in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, despite slowing down to celebrate in the 100m and running into a headwind in the 200m. Dawn Harper won gold in the 100m hurdles after her U.S. teammate, Lolo Jones, clipped the ninth hurdle and stumbled. Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva broke the world record in the pole vault to secure her second consecutive gold medal. Kenya's Samuel Wanjiru obliterated the Olympic record to claim the first gold medal for his country in the marathon.\n\nAthens 2004\n\nThe U.S. men had their brooms out, racing to sweeps in both the 200m and 400m events. Justin Gatlin also claimed the gold medal for the U.S. in the 100m. In the women's sprints, young athletes made their Olympic mark, as an 18-year-old Allyson Felix took silver in the 200m and 20-year-old Lauryn Williams earned silver in the 100m. Overall, the U.S. laid claim to 25 medals, the most since the 1992 Barcelona Games. Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj completed a rare distance double in the 1500m and 5000m.\n\nSydney 2000\n\nCathy Freeman was given the honor of lighting the Olympic Cauldron during the Opening Ceremony, and ten day later, she delivered a stirring victory in the 400m. It was Australia's first track and field gold medal since 1988. In her Olympic debut, Marion Jones-Thompson of the United States claimed five medals, but she has since been stripped of her medals. U.S. sprinters won gold medals in the 100m thanks to Maurice Greene and 400m courtesy of Michael Johnson.\n\nAtlanta 1996\n\nMichael Johnson set a world record in the 200m on his way to becoming the first man to own Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m. Veteran American athletes shined in Atlanta, as Carl Lewis won his fourth long jump title at the age of 35, and 34-year-old Jackie Joyner-Kersee claimed the bronze in the long jump to bring her Olympic medal tally to seven. U.S. decathlete Dan O'Brien, who failed to even qualify for Barcelona, managed to claim the gold in Atlanta. Russia's Svetlana Masterkova surprised the favorites by sweeping the 800m and 1500m.\n\nBarcelona 1992\n\nFor American sprinter Gail Devers, the Barcelona Games were marked by fulfillment and disappointment. She won a gold medal in the closest 100m finish in Olympic history, but five days later, she hit the final hurdle and tumbled across the finish line of the 100m hurdles in fifth. In the women's 10,000m, Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia became the first black African woman to win an Olympic medal. She celebrated by taking a victory lap, hand in hand, with Elana Meyer, a white South African.\n\nSeoul 1988\n\nThe winner of the men's 100m, Ben Johnson of Canada, was disqualified after testing positive for anabolic steroids. The gold medal was then awarded to Carl Lewis, who also claimed gold in the long jump. American sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner left Seoul with four Olympic medals, including gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.\n\nLos Angeles 1984\n\nAs the Games returned to American soil for the first time since 1932, Carl Lewis of the United States matched Jesse Owens' performance at the 1936 Berlin Games by winning gold medals in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and long jump. Two-time Boston Marathon winner Joan Benoit won the inaugural Olympic women's marathon. Prior to 1984, women never had competed in an Olympic race longer that 1500m.\n\nMoscow 1980\n\nPerhaps the most anticipated showdown of the Moscow Games was between middle-distance runners Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe of Great Britain. Going into the 800m, world record holder Coe was the favorite, but Ovett edged him by 45-hundredths of a second to take gold. Six days later, Coe overcome the disappointment of that defeat by winning in the 1500m, upsetting the favored Ovett, who came away with bronze. The United States was one of the countries that boycotted the 1980 Games.\n\nMexico City 1968\n\nAs \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played and the U.S. flag was raised during the medal ceremony for the men's 200m in Mexico City, gold medalist Tommie Smith and bronze medalist John Carlos, both of the United States, bowed their heads and raised their black-gloved, clenched fists in a demonstration against racial injustice. American discus thrower Al Oerter became the first track and field athlete to win four gold medals in the same event. American high jumper Dick Fosbury claimed Olympic gold using a distinct technique, dubbed the \"Fosbury Flop.\"\n\nTokyo 1964\n\nAmerican Billy Mills, who had never run the 10,000m in under 29 minutes, clocked a time of 28:24.4 to become the first and still only American to claim Olympic gold in the event. Fellow American Wyomia Tyus claimed the 100m gold medal by defeating her Tennessee State teammate, Edith McGuire. McGuire was also the 200m gold medalist.\n\nRome 1960\n\nAs a child, Wilma Rudolph suffered from polio, scarlet fever and pneumonia, and was unable to walk until she was 7. But at the 1960 Rome Olympics, the 20-year-old Tennessee native earned the title of \"Fastest Woman in the World\" by winning the 100m. Rudolph also won gold in the 200m and 4x100m relay, becoming the first American woman to win three gold medals at one Olympics. In the decathlon, Rafer Johnson of the United States defeated C.K. Yang, his teammate at UCLA.\n\nBerlin 1936\n\nUnder the gaze of Adolph Hitler, who intended the Berlin Games to be a showcase of Aryan superiority, African-American Jesse Owens emerged as an Olympic hero. With a distinct, upright running style — \"My foot is only a fraction of the time on the track,\" he once explained — Owens raced to victories in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. He also won the long jump as part of a four-gold effort.\n\nLos Angeles 1932\n\nNicknamed \"Babe\" because she could hit a baseball like Babe Ruth, 21-year-old Texan Mildred Didrikson Zaharias entered the Los Angeles Games qualified for five women's track and field events. But due to rules restricting female participation, she was only allowed to compete in three events. A natural-born, all-around athlete, Didrikson won two Olympic gold medals in the 80m hurdles and javelin, and a silver in the high jump, before going on to become one of the greatest female golfers of all time.\n\nAmsterdam 1928\n\nDespite the objections of some, including modern Games founder Baron de Coubertin and Pope Pius XI, women were allowed to compete in Olympic track and field events for the first time in Amsterdam. The women's program included the 100m, 800m and 4x100m relay, plus the high jump and discus. With a victory in the 100m, Betty Robinson, a 16-year-old high school student from Riverdale, Illinois, became the first woman to win an Olympic track and field title.\n\nParis 1924\n\nFinland was a distance-running superpower in the 1920s and 1930s, as evidenced by its success at the 1924 Olympics. The most prolific of the \"Flying Finns\" was Paavo Nurmi, who won five gold medals in Paris to complement the two golds and one silver he earned four years earlier. Two of Nurmi's 1924 triumphs came in the 1500m and 5000m races held just an hour apart. Finnish officials kept Nurmi out of the 10,000m, which teammate Ville Ritola won in world record time en route to a six-medal output in Paris (four gold, two silver). Nurmi would go on to win the 10,000m in 1928, ultimately closing his Olympic career with nine gold medals.\n\nAntwerp 1920\n\nRunners from Great Britain took the top two spots on the medal stand for the men's 1500m, with Albert Hill winning the gold medal and Philip Baker claiming the silver. Baker, who would later adopt his wife's maiden name and become known as Philip Noel-Baker, went on to a distinguished career as a member of British Parliament and a staunch proponent of global disarmament, eventually earning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1959.\n\nLondon 1908\n\nAs a reported 100,000 spectators looked on, Italy's Dorando Pietri staggered into London's Olympic Stadium for the final 385 yards of the marathon. Pietri, delirious and exhausted, took a wrong turn onto the track, and collapsed. Race officials, despite the fact that their actions would result in disqualification for the Italian runner, rushed to his aid, helping him across the finish line. Although Pietri was denied the gold medal, he gained worldwide fame and became one of the most famous non-winners in Olympic history.\n\nSt. Louis 1904\n\nThe 1904 marathon is considered one of the strangest Olympic races ever. Among the entrants was a Cuban postman, Felix Carvajal, who hitchhiked to St. Louis after losing his money in a New Orleans crap game. He arrived at the start wearing street shoes and long pants, chatted with spectators mid-race, diverted from the course into an apple orchard and ultimately finished fourth. Another competitor was chased into a cornfield by two dogs. American Frederick Lorz crossed the finish line first but was discovered to have hitched a ride for 11 miles. With his admitted practical joke resolved, Lorz's compatriot Thomas Hicks was crowned the official winner.\n\nParis 1900\n\nWith victories in the 60m, 110m hurdles, 200m hurdles and long jump at the Paris Games, American Alvin \"Al\" Kraenzlein set the still-standing record for most individual track and field titles in one Games. Using an unorthodox extended-leg style, he revolutionized hurdling, establishing the style used by future generations. Indiana's Ray Ewry, in the course of one afternoon, won three Olympic titles: the standing long jump, standing high jump and standing triple jump."
