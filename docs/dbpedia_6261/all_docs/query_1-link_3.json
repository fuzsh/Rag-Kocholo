        "text": "There were five equestrian events contested at the 1924 Olympics, with individual and team competitions in jumping and three-day event, and an individual dressage event. The competitions were restricted to men and military officers, as they would be through 1948. Most of the events were held at the main Olympic Stadium, Stade Olympique de Colombes. The three-day event cross-country phase was held in Villacoublay and at the Hippodrome d’Auteuil in Paris. Both Sweden and the Netherlands won two gold medals, with the Swedes leading the medal list with four total medals, adding two silvers, as 10 different nations won medals. This was the first Olympic competition in equestrianism after the formation of the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI), which was founded in 1921 at a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland."
