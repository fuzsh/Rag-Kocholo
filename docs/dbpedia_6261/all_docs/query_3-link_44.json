        "text": "U.S. Eventing Team History\n\nThe first occurrence of eventing in the modern Olympics was in 1912 when Count Clarence von Rosen, Master of the Horse to the King of Sweden, devised the first event. From 1912-1948 teams for all major championships were provided by the U.S. Cavalry and then the United States Equestrian Team (USET) took over the management and selection of teams. The U.S. has been sending teams to compete in three-day eventing in the Olympics, World Championships, and Pan American Games for over 100 years.\n\nCali, Colombia\n\nThe U.S. Team planned to send James C. Wofford and Kilkenny as individuals to the Pan American Games, but decided against it at the last minute due to the epidemic of Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis.\n\nThe 1980 Olympics in Moscow were boycotted by the U.S. because of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. Instead, the U.S. competed in a CCIO at Fontainebleau in France.\n\nMike Huber/Gold Chip\n\nJ. Michael Plumb/Laurenson\n\nTorrance Watkins (individual bronze)\n\nJames C. Wofford and Carawich (individual silver)\n\nIndividuals:\n\nWash Bishop/Taxi\n\nKaren Stives/The Saint (34th)\n\nHavana, Cuba\n\nEventing in Chatsworth, Georgia\n\n(First U.S. team selected by an objective point system based on rankings)\n\nTeresa Hover/Hampton\n\nJane Sleeper/Take Over\n\nJosh Walther/Off the Cuff (15th)\n\nJohn Williams/Outback Red\n\nIndividuals:\n\nLisa Dreher/Whiskey River\n\nAbigail Lufkin/Flexible Flyer (individual bronze)\n\nSara Miller/Table Tales\n\nElizabeth Refo/Better By Farr (11th)\n\nTodd Trewin/Sandscript (7th)\n\nRebekah Smith/Paws (5th)\n\nJil Walton/Fax (6th)"
