        "text": "It was my second time to watch Mark’s concert and first time at the Pine City of Mindanao, Malaybalay, Bukidnon. November 26, 2005, after our whole day Company activity at Roan Beach Resort we headed immediately for an hour travel to Malaybalay at 7:00 in the evening to watch Mark’s Concert there, which will start at 9 PM. I really love to see the views of Bukidnon while traveling towards our destination but too bad we traveled at night I can’t see the serene of Bukidnon, all I can see are nothing but the winding road reflected by the van’s head light.\n\nAnyway, that’s only the side tours but our main reason is to watch Mark’s concert. Wow… it was great to watch the pride of Cagay-anons’ talent. Mark is really a talented person, a down to earth and has a nice voice. No wonder he made it to the top. To Mark, thanks for being so accommodating at the hotel room it was indeed an exclusive for us and also thanks to Mark’s families and friends. Keep it up Mark. The Torres family, Mr. & Mrs. Elmer and Avelina Torres, thanks for inviting me to watch your friend and favorite Mark Bautista’s concert. That’s the second time to experience an exclusive event.\n\nI also met the talented, down to earth and beautiful Nikki Bacolod at Mark’s concert, we talked too at the Hotel and took some pictures with her. Nikki was the First runner up of the first Search for a Star in a Million. She was the pride of Iligan City. Go! Bisaya!!! Go Mindanaoan!"
