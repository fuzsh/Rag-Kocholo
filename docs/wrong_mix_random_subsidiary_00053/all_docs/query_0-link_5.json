Just add them to the list!\n\nRanked by\n\n1\n\nJosé Feliciano\n\n09/10/1945\n\nBirthplace : Lares, United States, with Territories\n\nJosé Monserrate Feliciano García (born September 10, 1945), better known simply as José Feliciano [xoˈse feliˈsjano], is a Puerto Rican musician, singer and composer, best known for many international hits, including his rendition of The Doors' \"Light My Fire\" and the best-selling Christmas single, \"Feliz Navidad\". His music is known for its fusion of styles: Latin, jazz, blues, soul and even rock, created primarily with his unique, signature acoustic guitar sound. His oftentimes mellow easy listening influences are easily recognizable in many songs heard around the world.In the United States, he first received widespread popularity in the 1960s, particularly after his 1968 album Feliciano! reached number two on the music charts. Thus far, he has released over fifty albums, worldwide, in both English and Spanish.\n\nBirthplace : Setúbal, Portugal\n\nJosé Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix, GOIH (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛ moˈɾiɲu]; born 26 January 1963), is a Portuguese professional football coach and former player who currently works at Sky Sports as a pundit. He most recently served as manager of English club Manchester United. As a manager, Mourinho has won 25 major honours, making him one of the most successful managers of all time. He was named Portuguese Coach of the Century by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) in 2015, and was the first coach to spend more than £1 billion on transfers. Due to his tactical knowledge, charismatic and controversial personality, and what his opponents regard as an emphasis on getting results over playing beautiful football, he has drawn comparisons, by both admirers and critics, with Argentine manager Helenio Herrera. He regards himself as one of the greatest managers of all time.Following an uneventful career as a player across Portugal's football pyramid, he initially worked as an interpreter for Sir Bobby Robson at Sporting CP and Porto, before gaining success as an assistant at Barcelona under both Robson and his successor, Louis van Gaal. Mourinho then impressed with brief managerial periods at Benfica and União de Leiria, taking the latter to their highest ever league finish. He returned to Porto as head coach in 2002, winning the Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal and UEFA Cup in his first season, followed by the UEFA Champions League the season after, the club's first European Cup title since 1987, as well as retaining the Primeira Liga title. That success earned him a move to England with Chelsea, where he won the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons, as well as the FA Cup once and the League Cup twice, before departing amid reports of a rift with club owner Roman Abramovich.In 2008, Mourinho joined Italian club Inter Milan, where he won the Serie A title in his first season, before leading the club to become the first Italian side to win the Treble (Serie A, Coppa Italia and UEFA Champions League) in 2010, the latter making him one of five coaches to have won the European Cup with two different teams. He was also the recipient of the first ever FIFA World Coach of the Year award in 2010. He then signed with Real Madrid, where he won the Copa del Rey in his first season and La Liga with a record points total in his second, making him the fifth coach to have won league titles in four different countries. He left Madrid in 2013, however, after winning only the Supercopa de España in his final season there. He then returned to Chelsea, where he won another league title and League Cup, but was dismissed in 2015 after a poor run of results. He was appointed at Manchester United in 2016, where he won the UEFA Europa League and EFL Cup in his first season. Although he led the club to second place in the Premier League the following year, the club's highest league finish since 2013, he did not win any trophies, and was dismissed in December 2018, midway through his third season at the club.\n\nBirthplace : Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nJosé Manuel Moreno Fernández (3 August 1916 — 26 August 1978), nicknamed \"El Charro\", was an Argentine footballer who played as an inside forward for several clubs in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia; for many who saw him play, he is one of the greatest players of all time, even along Diego Maradona, Pelé and Alfredo Di Stéfano, and was the first footballer ever to have won first division league titles in four countries (later players to emulate the feat include Jiri Jarosik and Rivaldo). Moreno was part of the River Plate team known as La Máquina (\"The Machine\") which dominated Argentine football in the 1940s, and was also a member of the Argentine national team with which he won the South American Championships in 1941 and 1947, being chosen in the latter as the best player of the tournament.He was regarded by many as a complete player. In 1999, he was ranked as the 5th best south american player in the 20th Century (behind Pelé, Maradona, Di Stéfano and Garrincha), and among the 25 best players in the world through a poll by the IFFHS. He was known as a player of great technique, great vision, and lethal in the penalty area. Despite his reputation for drinking, smoking and not going to training, Moreno was also known for his formidable heading ability and fine physical qualities.\n\nBirthplace : Pueblo Viejo, Azua, Dominican Republic\n\nJosé Ramón Nova Mesa (Spanish: [xoˈse ˈmesa]; born May 22, 1966) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball from 1987 through 2007. He played for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Colorado Rockies, and Detroit Tigers. He retired with 321 career saves. Mesa was a two-time MLB All-Star and won the American League (AL) Rolaids Relief Man Award in 1995, when he led the AL in saves. His nickname was \"Joe Table\", the literal translation of his name in the English language.\n\nBirthplace : Goizueta, Spain\n\nJosé María Bakero Escudero (born 11 February 1963) is a Spanish retired footballer, and is a manager. Having played mainly for Real Sociedad and Barcelona, he began his career as a forward (not being a prolific goalscorer) but was converted into an attacking midfielder, who possessed passing and scoring ability (with both his right foot and his head, the second despite his short stature) and great leadership skills. During a 17-year professional career, Bakero amassed La Liga totals of 483 games and 139 goals, winning a total of 17 titles. In the 2000s, he embarked on a coaching career. A Spanish international during seven years, he represented the nation in two World Cups and one European Championship; in 1999, he began working as a manager.\n\nBirthplace : Valencia, Spain\n\nJosé Enrique Sánchez Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse enˈrike ˈsantʃeθ ˈði.aθ]; born 23 January 1986), known as José Enrique, is a retired Spanish footballer who played as a left back. Starting his career with Levante, he was signed by their rivals Valencia and made La Liga appearances for Celta and Villarreal. He then spent nine years in England with Newcastle United and Liverpool, totalling 161 Premier League appearances. With the latter club, he won the League Cup and lost the FA Cup final in 2012. He retired through injury in 2017, after a year back in Spain with Real Zaragoza."
