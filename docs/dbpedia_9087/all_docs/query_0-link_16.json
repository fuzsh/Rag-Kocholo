During the Third Dynasty of Ur, the city was ruled by Assyrian governors subject to the Sumerians.\n\nTabira Gate\n\nThe Tabira Gate, also spelled as Tabera Gate, structure is thought to date to the fourteenth century BCE. It is the best preserved structure at the archaeological site of ancient Assur.\n\nIt sustained heavy damage in 2015 when ISIS militants, having conquered the area, blew a hole in the structure. In 2020, three years after the area’s liberation, a joint project between the American University of Iraq-Sulaimani and the Aliph Foundation, a group that works to protect cultural heritage in war zones, carried out reconstruction work on the gate.\n\nAssur Ziggurat\n\nFrom the first half of the second millennium BCE until 614 BCE, there was a ziggurat, a temple-tower, at Assur dedicated to the god Aššur (and his manifestation as the god Enlil). This sacred building, which went by the Sumerian name Earattakišarra (\"House, Mountain/Noblest of the Universe\") in the first millennium BCE and referred to as the \"great ziggurat\" in Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions, was likely founded by the Old Assyrian ruler Šamšī-Adad I (circa 1808–1776 BCE). In this era, the Great Royal Palace was built, and the temple of Assur was expanded and enlarged with a ziggurat. Today the remains of the Assur or Ashur Ziggurat measure some eighty five feet in height, in its heyday it would have stood at least twice that height. More than 4,000 years old, it was part of a temple complex dedicated to the god Assur. In antiquity its six million mud bricks (الطوب) were covered with sheets of iron and lead and inlaid with crystals.\n\nRoyal Assyrian Tomb Complex\n\nThe royal tomb-complex was discovered under the Neo-Assyrian palace complex by Walter Andre in 1912 CE. Initially thought to be from the Parthian period, the tombs actually belonged to Assyrian Kings, as indicated in the accompanying inscriptions. The tomb-complex seems to have been established by either AsurbelKala or his father Tiglath-Pileser I in the eleventh century BCE. No references to the royal or kings' tombs are known before this discovery.\n\nThe layout of the tomb-complex is simple, comprising of six chambers connected a corridor, with a seventh grave of an unidentified individual separated from the main complex. The tomb chambers belong to AshurNasirPal II (burial chamber V), AsurbelKala (burial chamber III), and Shamshi Adad V (burial chamber II) on the basis of the inscriptions found at the site. The burial chamber has been speculated to belong to either Esarhaddon or his son, Ashurbanipal. The bricks found at the site indicate that Sennachrib, the second king of the Sargonid dynasty, was most likely also buried in the vicinity.\n\nIn terms of remains, not much survived, as most of the burial structures, sarcophagi were destroyed during the invasions of Medes and Babylonians and other valuable graves goods were systematically looted. Though the discovery and subsequent identification of some of the tombs provides valuable insight in to the cultural, religious and funerary practices of ancient Assyrians it raises a question for the location of other royal tombs, since there were many Assyrian kings in addition to these.\n\nBasalt Water Basin from Temple of Ishtar at Ashur\n\nThis Water Basin dating back to circa 700 BCE was carved from one monolithic block but was discovered completely fragmented (most likely destroyed during the Fall of Assur in 614 BCE) in one of the courtyards of the Temple of ancient Assur. It was reconstructed using many of its original components and reliefs. It was a solid basalt tub from one of the gardens outside the Temple of Ishtar at Assur.\n\nThe Water Basin sculptures depict Enki, the Sumerian god of water, who can be seen at the center with water flowing from his chest just below his beard. The god Enki is surrounded by figures with fish heads and fish skin flowing down their backs. These figures are presumably priests wearing fish-shaped garments. The figures hold objects to perform their traditional acts of purification and blessing. The other relief sculptures portray the Gods and sages of Sumerian legend and religion. The inner surfaces of the basin, which served to perform cultic acts, remained unadorned and could hold about 7,000 liters of water. A repeated cuneiform inscription gives the name of the Assyrian king Sennacherib.\n\nThe Madain Project is an online archive of Abrahamic History and Archaeology.\n\nAbrahamic History & Archaeology is the study of history and archaeology with respect to the three Abrahamic Faiths without considering the religious and theological aspects. The goal of Abrahamic History is to understand how and why the religious doctrines and behaviours have evlovled and changed over time. Searching for patterns in the evolution of significant cultural events such as the development of farming, the emergence of cities, or the collapse of major civilizations for clues of why and how these have influenced the three major Abrahamic religions."
