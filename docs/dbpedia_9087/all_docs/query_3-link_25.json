        "text": "Assyria, officially the Kingdom of Assyria, is a sovereign state located in the Middle East. It borders Georgia and Armenia to the north, Iran to the east, Turkey to the west, Egypt to the southwest and Saudi Arabia and Hejaz to the south. Its capital is Assur and its largest city is the Thrice Holy City of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Kingdom of Assyria and its people trace their descent to the ancient Assyrians, who founded three powerful empires in the region - the Old (2025-1378 BC), Middle (1392-934) and Neo (911-609 BC) Assyrian Empires. They all in turn trace descent to the city state of Assur, current capital of the kingdom, which was founded in 2500 BC. The city, and from its people and nation, are all named after the ancient Mesopotamian deity Assur (or Ashur, depends on the spelling), which the people worshipped and took their name from. This ancient state ceased to exist after it was conquered by the ancient Babylonan and Persian empires.\n\nNo Assyrian state existed between 609 BC and 1163, although its people survived and kept on being the bulk of the population of northern Mesopotamia. They eventually adopted Christianity and most of them kept their faith even in the face of the eventual Muslim invasion into Mesopotamia.\n\nThe modern Assyrian state was founded by Ashur (1130-1201), a native Assyrian, who would gather a large following early on and become a powerful local warlord, who protected his people and quickly became popular among the Assyrians. While a Christian and follower of the Church of the East, he rejected both Christian and Muslim rule and sought to reestablish the ancient Assyrian civilization, of which he had heard tales as a child. He mostly kept his campaigns focused on the Seljuks, from which he famously took the ancient city of Assur and later on Edessa, the then center of the Church of the East. The foundation of the kingdom is considered Christmas, 1163, the date that the Patriarch of the Eastern Church crowned Ashur as King of Assyria.\n\nAshur would ally with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and even arrange the betrothal of his heir, Ashurbanipal to the King of Jerusalem's daughter Sybilla, who would eventually succeed her father as king. Following this, the two Christian kingdoms would unite under their heir - Esarhaddon I, who would go on to cause the collapse of the Seljuk empire.\n\nThe new Assyrian kingdom would go on to fight a successful war against Egypt and take territory as far west as the Nile and gain full control of Mesopotamia, dividing the Muslim world in three - Iran, Arabia and North Africa. To the north, Assyria would successfully defend itself against the attacks of Timur from Persia and prevent the Ottoman Empire from spreading beyond Anatolia.\n\nRegardless of its pro-Christian politics, the Kings of Assyria since Sargon II (1446-1506) would allow free access to the various Christian, Muslim and Jewish holy cites in Jerusalem. He would even be responsible for the resettlement of the Levant with Jews after they were expelled from Spain. Queen Saritrah II would aide in the exodus of countless Jews, fleeing Nazi Germany's persecution.\n\nThe current king is Ashurbanipal VII, who is the head of state. Although it is a constitutional monarchy, the king retains a great amount of influence in both society and politics. The Prime minister, who is the head of government, is Yonadam Kanna.\n\nAssyria is a developed country with a strong economy, ranking 4th in the world by nominal GDP and 5th by PPP. It ranks consistently high on the human development index. It is also a regional power and a member of several international organizations like the United Nations, OPEC, World Bank, NATO, etc.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nAncient Assyrian, the name of the state (mat Aš-šur) literally means \"Country of the city of god Aššur\". Both country and people were named after their ancient chief deity Assur. Nowadays the country's name remains the same although under the modern Syriac- Aramaic language, where the word \"country\" is changed with the one for \"kingdom\"\n\nUp to near the end of the Renaissance, in Europe the Latin \"Regnum Assyriorum\" and French \"Royaume d'Assyrie\" were often in use.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAncient Assyria[]\n\nwikipedia:Old Assyrian Empire\n\nwikipedia:Middle Assyrian Empire\n\nwikipedia:Neo-Assyrian Empire\n\nAshur and the Christian Assyria[]\n\nThe modern country of Assyria traces its descent from the Assyrian warlord Ashur (1130-1201 AC). Born from an unknown family, he was raised in an Assyrian Christian community in the northern Mesopotamia, the region being dominated by the native Assyrians who were however ruled by foreigners since the fall of the last empire in 609 BC, almost 2000 years earlier. Having grown up on the tales of their ancestors, Ashur, named after these ancient people's deity, came to believe that it was his duty to forge a nation for his people and rid them of their foreign oppressors - be they the Byzantines, the French Crusaders, the Seljuks or the Arabs. He eventually became the leader of a warband, which set itself to harass the Seljuks and would often fight for the invading Crusaders, for a price. As time went on, Ashur would become more and more powerful and loved by his people, respected for his honor, courage and intellect. Ashur would take control of the ancient city of Assur, which was still habitable despite all the years, from the Zengids, a Muslim dynasty. He would go on to further take Edessa from the Seljuks in a daring raid on the city. In a bold move, the Patriarch of the Church of the East in Edessa would choose to back Ashur and personally crowned him the King of Assyria. While some say the move was nothing more than an expression of gratitude from the Christian priests, this day (25 December 1163) would remain in history as the founding date of the new Assyrian kingdom.\n\nAshur's further exploits would cement his status as a regional power and gain him the recognition of both the Byzantine Emperor and the King of Jerusalem Almaric, the latter of whom would even go on to marry his daughter Sibylla to Ashur's firstborn son - Ashurbanipal, named so in an effort to remind the Assyrians of the great glories of their ancestors, a naming trend which keeps on to this day.\n\nAshurbanipal I and Sibylla of Jerusalem[]\n\nSibylla was the king's daughter and he had sons thus it was not expected for her to inherit anything. Yet upon their deaths, in 1186 she was crowned Queen of Jerusalem. Ashurbanipal was raised by his father and accompanied him on his military campaigns from an early age. The marriage had been arranged in part by King Amalric because he wanted to gain the support of Ashurbanipal's mighty father, who had by then established himself as a force in the region and had never lost a battle. Jerusalem on the other hand was often in a precarious position since the Arab forces of leaders like Saladin who often menaced the Crusaders and were more than a match for them. Saladin and Ashur were enemies without a doubt, but both were unwilling to fight one another too much, since the Kurd knew that Assyria while still young was militarily strong and Ashur was a strong leader, proven by his taking of Edessa in 1163 and Damascus in 1179. Joint offensive on Muslim Egypt still however proved to be a challenge and a failure. Despite that Ashurbanipal proved himself by taking Syria and forcing Saladin into his Egyptian holdings.\n\nAshurbanipal became jointly with his wife King of Jerusalem. While she kept most power to herself, a decision backed by the Crusader nobility, he soon became well-liked among them and began building up his authority. He either subjugated or destroyed most of the nomadic tribes, living in the mountains of Mesopotamia, and managed to tame much of the region. The two had a son Esarhaddon who joined the two kingdoms into one - or rather annexed the Kingdom of Jerusalem into Assyria and dubbed himself King of Assyria and Jerusalem. This did not go unchallenged, namely by foreign-born crusaders who invited foreign powers to help depose him due to Esarhaddon wishing to remove the French-born aristocracy in favor of Assyrian-born loyalists. This brief conflict, called the War of Jerusalemian Succession lasted between 1213 and 1215 and ended with Crusader retreat from the Holy Land, \"leaving it in the care of Christian hands\".\n\nThis marked the permanent establishment of the Kingdom of Assyria in the Middle East as a Christian kingdom, on par with the ones in Europe, which played on both the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern front.\n\nOttoman-Assyrian War[]\n\nWhile uninvolved in the Siege of Constantinople, King Sennacherib I of Assyria would fight a 10 year war with the Ottoman Mehmed II who then wished to expand his borders in the east. The Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt surprisingly joined forces with Assyria as it preferred to remain the strongest Muslim power in that part of the world. The war ended in 1469 with a peace treaty between the two rulers. Most importantly, it forged the future Ottoman policy of focusing on Europe instead of the Middle East. To further seal the treaty, the sons of the two rulers were raised together for about 5 years, which forged a lifelong friendship between Sultan Bayezid II and King Sargon II.\n\nWar for Cyprus[]\n\nBy 1489, Cyprus had remained the sole Crusader state under the rule of Catherine Cornaro, a native Venetian. For almost a century, the state had been a vassal of Assyria in order to gain protection from the menaces of the Byzantine and later Ottoman Empires. In 1489 the Venetian government persuaded her to cede her rights over the island to the Doge of Venice, de facto the Venetian republic. Simultaneously, a previous treaty had existed between Assyria and Cyprus, signed by Catherine's late husband James II. According to it, in the absence of an heir to Cyprus, the Cypriot throne would pass to the King of Assyria. This treaty, obviously unfavorable to the Venetians, was disregarded and this provoked the rage of King Sargon II of Assyria. A tried and tested battle commander, he was furious at Venice and threatened war over the island. He had already began building a fleet along the Mediterranean and he gained the opportunity to use it after the Venetians took his word for it and started the War for Cyprus, lasting from 1490 to 1496. The war would end with the help of Pope Pius IV who would broker the Peace of Naples, recognizing the rights of Assyria in exchange for aid in spreading Christianity in the Middle East and giving some trading rights to Venice.\n\nJewish emigration[]\n\nIn 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain via the Alhambra Decree by the Catholic monarchs of Spain Ferdinand and Isabel. Such measures were not uncommon in that time as similar edicts had been made in France and England. Sargon II of Assyria and Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire both would send their ships to Spain in order to safely escort the Jews to their respective countries, where new Jewish communities would thrive. Both monarchs of the time thought that the Catholic monarchs were foolish for expelling the Jews, whom Bayezid called a \"national treasure\" and Ferdinand and Isabel \"fools\". While the two Middle-Eastern rulers were of different faiths, as part of the peace treaty between their fathers (Sennacherib I and Mehmed II), the two grew up together for a time and were close friends and allies.\n\nSargon would settle the Jews in their ancient homeland of Israel, in particular the cities of Acre and Jerusalem. Perhaps due to his upbringing, Sargon was probably the most religiously tolerant ruler of his time. He signed a mutual treaty with the surrounding Muslim states, whereby he allowed the safe passage of pilgrims of all faiths to Jerusalem, dubbing it \"the thrice holy city\", in exchange for an affordable tax, which nevertheless filled his treasury and made him very wealthy. This policy of religious tolerance became the norm for the future Assyrian monarchs. While it was considered a controversial and unlikeable move by European Christian monarchs, Muslim rulers gained great respect for the House of Ashur.\n\nThe Jews themselves contributed greatly to both states by providing new ideas and craftsmanship, including the introduction of the printing press. The latter was first used by the state in an official capacity to spread the Edict of Sargon, which commanded for religious tolerance.\n\nThe New World[]\n\nControlling much of the Middle East provided Assyria with relatively easy access to the wonders of the Orient, including Indian spices, which had grown very popular in Europe. Nevertheless, the occasional conflicts there with the Arab kingdoms and Egypt made the merchants wary of travelling through Assyria by the 15th century, which eventually led to Christopher Columbus attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach India and instead found the Americas. Unlike Europe, Assyria had little opportunity to colonize the Americas due to the huge distance between them. Moreover, its trade with India and the east was stable while the kings were ever focused on defending their borders from their rivals. Despite an initially friendly relationship with some of their neighbors, conflicts often arose between the powers vying for dominance in the region. Particularly Egypt and Persia, both of which made several attempts to invade Assyria.\n\nGovernment and politics[]\n\nMonarchy[]\n\nSince its foundation, the kingdom had been ruled by a single royal family - the House of Ashur, named after its founder and first king Ashur I. Having reigned continuously since 1163, they are the second longest reigning royal dynasty after the Yamato Clan (Japan). Traditionally, the royal family names its children, particularly the ones closest to the throne, after ancient Assyrian rulers. The current monarch is King Ashurbanipal VII, who succeeded his father Sennacherib VI. His heir is Shalmaneser, Prince of Jerusalem.\n\nThe full style of the monarch is: His Majesty Ashurbanipal VII, by the Grace of God, King of Assyria, King of Sumer and Akkad, King of Mesopotamia, King of Israel and the Palestine, Defender of the Holy Sepulcher and the Thrice Holy City of Jerusalem.\n\nWhile it is a constitutional monarchy, the king still exercises vast constitutional executive powers atypical of such a form of government. He is the head of the army and all ministers and military officers swear allegiance to him before anyone else, including the people. Moreover, he has full command of the army, unlike other constitutional monarchies where the monarch is only the nominal commander-in-chief. This is exemplified by the fact that the Prime Minister can only appoint a vice-minister of defense to his cabinet as the office and authority of the Minister of Defense are held by the monarch by virtue of office.\n\nParliament[]"
