For a period they rose to the challenge of being surrounded by enemies and became the most powerful military force in the known world. Their legendary barbarity and fierceness was a deliberate policy intended to foster the submission of enemies and minimize the threat of revolt by vassals. ” —Excerpt from the Age of Empires manual\n\nAssyria was a Semitic Akkadian kingdom centered on the Upper Tigris river, in northern Mesopotamia (present day northern Iraq), that came to rule regional empires a number of times throughout history. It was named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur. Assyria was also sometimes known as Subartu, and after its fall as Athura, Syria and Assuristan. The term Assyria can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where these empires were centered. Their descendants still live in the region today, and they form the Christian minority in Iraq.[2] After the fall of the Akkadian Empire in 2080 BC, it eventually coalesced into two separate nations; Assyria in the north, and later Babylonia in the south.\n\nOriginally, the early Assyrian kings would certainly have been regional leaders only, and subjects of Sargon of Akkad, who united all of the Akkadian speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire, which lasted from 2334 BC to 2154 BC. The Akkadian nation of Assyria (and later on also Babylonia) evolved from the dissolution of the Akkadian Empire. In the Old Assyrian period of the Early Bronze Age, Assyria had been a kingdom of northern Mesopotamia, competing for dominance with its fellow Mesopotamian rival, Babylonia which was often under Kassite rule. During this period it established colonies in Asia Minor. It had experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Middle Assyrian period.\n\nBeginning with the campaigns of Adad-Nirari II from 911 BC, it again became a great power, conquering many of their neighbors. Eventually they weakened after so many wars and their empire would fall in the 7th century B.C.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe civilization's icon introduced in Return of Rome portrays an image of Ashur on a shape resembling large shields which were used in shield-walls.\n\nThe user interface image in Return of Rome is a Lamassu, a protective spirit of Sumerian origin representing the zodiacs, parent-stars or constellations, often featured at the entrances of palaces.\n\nDespite being a Mesopotamian people, they have the Egyptian architecture. The Sumerians also were in the same category before being moved to the Mesopotamian set in Return of Rome.\n\nBefore Return of Rome, they had extra speed on Villagers, which was the same bonus as the Yamato. Since the expansion's release, it has been removed from the Yamato.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
