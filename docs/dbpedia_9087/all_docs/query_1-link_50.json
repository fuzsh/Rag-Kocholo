        "text": "“There has not before been a study specifically dedicated to the periphery as a concept and entity in its own right. Such a study, long overdue, is both highly interesting and highly important. This is therefore a ground-breaking work.”\n\n—John MacGinnis, University of Cambridge\n\n“The book throws a fresh and innovative light on the methodological approach of an important subject in the history of the Ancient Near East.”\n\n—Ariel Bagg, Universität Heidelberg\n\n“The authors of this volume are to be congratulated on their achievement, presenting timely and insightful analysis of various important case studies within and beyond Assyria’s pale.”\n\n—The Middle Ground Journal\n\n\"The research is rigorous and current, with each author taking on the responsibility of extending his or her discrete study to reflect upon the broader implications of how we invoke, re-envision, or even discard the traditional core-periphery paradigm in studies of ancient empires. The result is a cohesive edited volume that capitalizes on the diversity of geographical locations, temporal scales, and artifactual evidence in its papers to provide the reader with a comprehensive compendium of perspectives on Neo-Assyrian Empire.\"\n\n—Journal of Near Eastern Archaeology\n\n“[Imperial Peripheries in the Neo-Assyrian Period] presents an excellent blending of multiple datasets—settlement object, architectural, historical, art historical—to form a contribution that will prove especially useful in the field of Assyrian and Near Eastern studies. . . . The discussions in this volume have the potential to be used broadly in furthering ideas about agency and centrality in discussions of any empire.”\n\n—American Antiquity"
