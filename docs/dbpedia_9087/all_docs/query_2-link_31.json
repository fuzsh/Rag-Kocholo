        "text": "As demonstrated by the exhibition Assyria to Iberia at the Dawn of Classical Age, the early first millennium\n\nFig. 1. The second of the four rock reliefs at Maltai. Image © 2013 Mapping Mesopotamian Monuments. Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University. All rights reserved.\n\nThe most famous Neo-Assyrian rock reliefs are those associated with the northern canal system built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (r. 704–681 b.c.) to carry water to his capital city of Nineveh and its surroundings. Located in remote mountainous areas, the northernmost and best preserved of these reliefs were sculpted into cliffs on the bank of the river Rubar Dohuk, opposite the town of Maltai (fig. 1), about 70 kilometers north of present-day Mosul, Iraq (see map). The iconography and location of this group of reliefs are of particular interest. Unlike other examples of Assyrian royal art, in which the king is represented worshipping symbols of gods, these reliefs show the king gesturing in front of anthropomorphic deities, or gods in human form. They depict a relatively small figure of the king as a worshipper facing right toward a line of five large gods and two goddesses mounted on animals and fantastic beasts, including from right to left, the gods Ashur, Ninlil, Sin, Anu or Enlil, Shamash, Adad, and Ishtar. Another figure of the king, facing left, is depicted at the end of the row of deities, creating a composition of divine figures flanked by two identical royal images.\n\nFig 2. The main relief at Khaniss, which portrays Sennacherib worshipping the deities Ashur and Ninlil. Image © 2013 Mapping Mesopotamian Monuments. Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University. All rights reserved.\n\nAlthough the king is not represented standing on an animal, his similarity to the gods is implied; he, too, carries an attribute in his right hand. Furthermore, the king is also represented within the rings held by the three first deities from right to left: Ashur, Ninlil, and Sin. By integrating the royal figure within a divine attribute, he could have been perceived as if he were a secondary god, an impression reinforced by another image of the king shown supporting the goddess Ninlil's throne. Although this godlike representation of the king is rarely seen on wall reliefs in Assyrian palaces, including those of Sennacherib himself, it appears to be an innovation especially common on Neo-Assyrian rock reliefs, as evident also at Khaniss (fig. 2), 60 kilometers northeast of Mosul. Another innovation, the display of deities mounted on real or fantastic animals, appears to be a motif borrowed by the Assyrians from Syrian iconography (fig. 3). Indeed, not only the representation of deities on animals but also their appearance in anthropomorphic form can be considered an inspiration derived from Syrian imagery that was common during the second and early first millennium b.c.\n\nFig. 3.
