        "text": "Mesopotamia was the ancient region on the eastern side of the Mediterranean, today's Iraq and parts of Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The ancient Mesopotamians evolved into three distinct cultures: Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian. The Assyrians settled in the northern half of Mesopotamia, and the Babylonians settled in the southern half. At the same time, the Persians began settlement in the area of Iran, not coming to power until 700 BCE. The ancient capital city of Ashur was the largest city of the Assyrian Empire, boasting a thriving trade platform, government, and the religious capital to crown their kings and tomb burial. The Babylonians built great ziggurats for their gods, and the most significant temple was for their supreme god, Marduk. The Persians built the great city of Persepolis, which means “city of Persians.”"
