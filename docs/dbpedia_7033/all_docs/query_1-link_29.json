Really? And I always thought they were very Ukrainian.\n\nK.\n\nPosted By: Orthodox Catholic Re: icon veils - 08:46 PM\n\nDear Kurt,\n\nIn actuality, Russian theologians have been fascinated by the Tibetans and their religious practices that do resemble those of the Orthodox Church.\n\nFor example, the Tibetans use prayer beads, make prostrations and a number of other ritual similarities.\n\nThe jury is out on the influence of the Assyrian Church of the East on Tibet, since, in the 9th century, Tibet had two Assyrian Archbishops and 20 Bishops in that area during the time of the T'ang Dynasty (to which Queen Elizabeth the Second is related, distantly, by Royal blood-line).\n\nLater persecution destroyed the Assyrian Church and the Orthodox prince of Rus' St Theodore of Smolensk later married the Mongolian Khan's daughter and established Orthodox Churches in Mongolia and China in the 13th century, a project supported by his sons, Sts. Constantine and David, themselves half-Mongolian.\n\nAs you know, Tibetan Buddhism was a cross between Mahayana Buddhism and the native pagan Tibetan religion of the Bon.\n\nThis religion could very well have adopted a number of Assyrian Church practices including the mitres of the Tibetans that exist to this day.\n\nRus' itself had many ties to Tibet and China via the trade-routes. The literary word for \"orange\" in both Russian and Ukrainian is the adopted German \"apelsina\" or \"Chinese apple\" as oranges first appeared there via China.\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: Daniil Re: icon veils - 09:16 PM\n\nSince the Great Fast is approaching (or has already hit you!), it should be noted that the veils placed over icons are often removed during this period of time. Then at Pascha, they are again draped over the icons as they were before. I don`t know where the practice comes from, but it makes sense.\n\nDaniil\n\nPosted By: Orthodox Catholic Re: icon veils - 09:25 PM\n\nDear Daniil,\n\nIf you could speak more to this fascinating subject, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWhat is the practice in your parish and what is its rationale? I think your parish would serve as the best possible example in so many things!\n\nSome parishes, following I believe a Latin Church practice, exchange the white veils for black or purple ones denoting sorrow.\n\nThe Latin Church also had (still has?) the practice of draping statues with black or purple cloths during Passion Week.\n\nIn some areas of Eastern Europe, it was considered irreverent for couples to make love in rooms where there were icons.\n\nSome developed the practice of draping the veils over the entire icon as a sign of \"respect\" before so doing.\n\nWhen people had an argument in the Carpathians, they would sometimes do the same in case someone used a profane word before the icons.\n\nThe veils themselves have particular usages that punctuate rites of passage.\n\nIt is still common for couples about to wed to kneel together on such an embroidered veil for a blessing from their parents and then this veil is used to cover the icons they receive in Church.\n\nKozaks knelt on such veils to receive the blessing from priests or their families before undergoing their crusades as well.\n\nThe veil can also be placed over pictures of e.g. Taras Shevchenko to denote a particular mark of respect for an individual, a family member. Sometimes a visiting hierarch is draped about the shoulders with such an embroidered veil.\n\nThis is where the similarity with the Tibetan practice lies.\n\nWhenever the Dalai Lama meets the Pope, he always places one of his veils around the Pope as a sign of respect and you then get to keep the veil.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is covered in such veils on his birthday.\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: Sharon Mech Re: icon veils - 09:30 PM\n\nMy dear Columcille & Alex,\n\nBelieve me, I am 'thumbody' myself as well, but cross stitch is one of those things that even a klutz can do, once ya figure out which end of the needle is which. (Ya stick the big end into the faric, and wrap the thread around the pointy end, right?? )\n\nOf course, none of the icons at my house are veiled.... Gotta finish the stitching on the sticharion first...in my copious spare time, LOL!\n\nA blesses Lent to all!\n\nSharon\n\nSharon Mech, SFO\n\nCantor & sinner\n\nsharon@cmhc.com\n\nPosted By: Medved Re: icon veils - 12:12 PM\n\nGLORY TO JESUS CHRIST!\n\nGLORY TO HIM FOREVER!\n\nAlex wrote:\"...the roots of the practice of the embroidered veil cloth are taken from the Hebrew Scriptures and the \"Tzith-tziths\" with tassels that the Hebrews wore and still wear...\"\n\nBut the patterns found on the rushnyky are ancient pre-Christian patterns that invoke the protection and blessing of the ancient fertility goddess. Many of these same patterns are found in the pysanky made during the Great Fast.\n\nAlthough the pysanky now how Christian meanings, the ancient meanings were wishes for prosperity and fertility.\n\nFor example, looking at the rushnyky on the site Alex gave, the red ones all have the central theme of a diamond with cross-hatched lines and spirals. These are often shown on pysanky and called \"FISHNETS\" to show that Christians are the fishers of men. In ancient times, this pattern was called the Fertile Field and was a wish for prosperous Spring with bountiful crops. The spirals are ancient symbols for the sun god.\n\nSorry to spout but have 4 dozen pysanky done already and still working....so many eggs, so little time.....\n\nmark\n\nPosted By: Orthodox Catholic Re: icon veils - 02:18 PM\n\nDear Brother Mark,\n\nYes, absolutely!\n\nI did not intend to suggest that our pre-Christian forefathers did not have their own meanings attached to these objects of our material culture!\n\nThe meanings have changed, as you have so wonderfully noted.\n\nMet. Ilarion Ohienko in his \"Pre-Christian Beliefs of the Ukrainian People\" discusses many such items and the meanings they have undergone.\n\nIn fact, if Ukraine had never become Christian, we would still have \"Kutya\" and the holy supper, the pussy-willows, the pysanky et al.\n\nIn the British Museum today are large stone statues of pagan Assyrian Kings 3000 BC.\n\nThey all have one thing in common. They are all wearing a Cross around their necks as we do today!\n\nAlso, tassels were and are promoted for their deep symbolic value by other religious cultures, to be sure.\n\nThe meaning you describe is also in keeping with the meaning given them by the Hebrew Scriptures and contemporary Jewish practice as well.\n\nThe same is true of the \"poyas\" our forefathers religiously wore to Church with their tassels. The Old Believers have a great veneration for the poyas and it would be unthinkable for them to attend Church without wearing one.\n\nI would put tassels on everything and certainly our Priests and Bishops make good use of them on their vestments.\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: RusynGrl Re: icon veils - 08:20 AM\n\nDear Sharon,\n\nDo you know where I might get a cross stitch pattern for an icon cloth? I'd be particularly interested in a traditional Ruthenian pattern/colors.\n\nThanks!\n\nBarbara (who must now cross stitch with those funny little glasses perched on the end of her nose!)\n\nPosted By: Medved Re: icon veils - 11:57 AM\n\nSLAVA ISUSU CHRISTU!\n\nSLAVA NA VIKI BOHU!\n\nHi Sharon\n\nWhich side of the mountains did your family come from?\n\nThe Slovakia side of the mountains did not do much cross stitch emboridery. It was mainly flat and running stitch.\n\nThe Zakarpatia side does more cross-stitch with beautiful geometric patterns.\n\nYou should try www.yevshan.com [yevshan.com] they're from Canada and do carry a good deal of Zakarpatia style embroidery books.\n\nYou could also do a search for Mary Kelley's books IN SEARCH OF THE GODDESS. She has written extensively about the embroidery of Central Europe and Russia and Ukraine. Much of what she has written concerns the use of ritual cloths. There should be patterns and color combos there also.\n\nHope this helps....\n\nmark\n\nPosted By: Sharon Mech Re: icon veils - 03:04 PM\n\nMark,\n\nI am reminded of the answer J. Michael Thompson gave to the folks who wanted to know which part of Ukraine his people came from. \"The far west,\" said he, \"the part by the Irish Sea.\"\n\nI haven't the first clue which side of the mountains two of my grandparents came from, tho' they did live near/in the Carpathians. Another grandparent was born in Eishashok, Lithuania - check out the Holocaust Museum for pictures of daily life & people there in the 1920's. (The fourth was born in the US of German parents.) They were all Jews, as were my parents.\n\nBarbara, I also don't know where to find patterns - I tend to chart my own. Check out the link Mark gave - it's likely to be a good one!\n\nBTW, I understand completely about \"those little glasses.\" I wear by-golly-I'm-trying-to-focals, and have probably done my last 18ct project...\n\nBest,\n\nSharon\n\nSharon Mech, SFO\n\nCantor & sinner\n\nsharon@cmhc.com\n\nPosted By: Medved Re: icon veils - 04:17 PM\n\nGLORY TO JESUS CHRIST!\n\nGLORY TO HIM FOREVER!\n\nHi Sharon!\n\nI must learn to NEVER answer emails before I have my morning OJ. The post I addressed to you should have been to Barbara. Sorry.....\n\nSharon also wrote: '.... Another grandparent was born in Eishashok, Lithuania - check out the Holocaust Museum for pictures of daily life & people there in the 1920's...\"\n\nSharon, I have a copy of the wonderful PBS show THERE ONCE WAS A VILLAGE that was all about life in Eishashok and the woman who's grandmother took all of the pictures that are in Tower at the Holocaust Museum. I have seen the tower and the photos and they are incredible!\n\nIt's a shame that I was not able to complete my visit to the Museum. There was a bomb threat called in the day I was there and we had to evacuate the building.\n\nI understand that Ed Asner and family as well as Lauren Bacall and family all have roots in this village.\n\nSorry for the confusion but grateful to learn of this wonderful piece of information about your past.\n\nthe least servant...\n\nmark\n\nPosted By: Sharon Mech Re: icon veils - 05:57 PM\n\nMark,\n\nI haven't seen the show - must check with the library. I believe the woman you are talking about is Yaffa Eliach. If you are ready for a riveting read, find a copy of \"Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust\" which she collected, edited, whatever you want to call it.\n\nOne of the \"smaller\" stories recounted in this book is of a young Jewish boy in Krakow whose parents had entrusted him to their Catholic neighbors, who promised to raise him Jewish. Later, thinking \"better\" of their promise, they took him to the priest. Hearing the story, he refused to baptize the boy. That young priest now sits on the throne of Peter.\n\nBTW, my grandmother once wrote to a distant cousin of mine that we had the Cossacks to thank for our lives. Seems they made life so impossible for Jews in Lithuania that her father packed up the family and came to America 30 years or so before the Nazis obliterated Eishashok.\n\nBest,\n\nSharon\n\nPosted By: Medved Re: icon veils - 09:42 PM\n\nGLORY TO JESUS CHRIST!\n\nGLORY TO HIM FOREVER!\n\nHi Sharon!\n\nThere was an interesting story in our local newspaper a few years ago. It concerned the large number of senior citizens going to visit psychaitrists (sp).\n\nIt's seems that many of these senior citizens we disturbed by the deaths of their parents and the events that followed. Most of them were given letters following their parents deaths and these letters told them their REAL names and that their real parents had been Jewish. They had been given to and raised by Polish families during the Holocaust.\n\nIt would be interesting to do some follow up work with these people.\n\nHave a good weekend!\n\nmark\n\nPosted By: RusynGrl Re: icon veils - 04:18 AM\n\nDear Mark/Sharon,\n\nThanks for the tips. Wouldn't you know it, we're from the Slovakia side of the mountains and I stink at flat embroidery!\n\n:rolleyes:\n\nBarbara\n\nPosted By: RichC Re: icon veils - 03:17 PM\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains separate Slovakia and Ukraine?
