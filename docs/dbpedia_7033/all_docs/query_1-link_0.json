        "text": "The Ecclesiastical Episcopal Designation of Archimandrite Ilarion was solemnized in the Kholm Cathedral on October 19, 1940, by the Primate of the Orthodox Church in the General-Government, Metropolitan Dionysiy; Exarch of the Ecumenical (Constantinople) Patriarch, Vladyka Sabbatheus, Archbishop of Prague; and Vladyka Timothy (Shreter), Bishop of Lublin. On the next day (October 20), in the Kholm Cathedral, these same Hierarchs solemnized the Chirotony (episcopal Consecration by laying on of bands) uPon Bishop-Nominee Ilarion, and during the Great Entrance Metropolitan Dionysios in accordance with the resolution of the Synod of Bishops, elevated Bishop of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya, Ilarion to the dignity of Archbishop, with the Archiepiscopal Cathedral in Kholm.\n\nThe Synod of Bishops of the Orthodox Church in the General-Government, under the leadership of Primate-Metropolitan, Vladyka Dionysiy, on March 16, 1944, deemed him (Ilarion) worthy of the title of Metropolitan of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya.\n\nVladyka Ilarion administrated the Archdiocese of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya until July 18, 1944, that is, until the day When the German authorities formally ordered an evacuation and proclaimed Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya as territory of frontal activities.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion rode out upon the evacuation train, with a portion of his clergy, to the city of Kielce, and from there to Krynytsia in Lemkiwshchyna. That same year he moved from Krynytsia to Strbske Pleso in Slovakia, and from there to Zakopane in Poland (1944). Shortly thereafter when the Soviet-German front moved to this territory, Metropolitan Ilarion departed for Austria and settled in the Herzogenburg Monastery near the city of Sankt-Poelten near Vienna. From there he moved further to the West, to the city of Feld-kirchen on April 2, 1945, and from there, on April 30, 1945, to the city of Lauzanne in Switzerland. He was ill here for some time and underwent three difficult operations.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion remained in Switzerland from April 30, 1945, until September 16, 1947. He came to the city of Winnipeg in Canada on September 19, 1947.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion—the Primate of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada\n\nDuring the time of Metropolitan Ilarion’s administration of the Archdiocese of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya, the situation of the Ukrainian Orthodox (as well as the situation of the Byelorussian Orthodox) with regard to the matter of jurisdiction already had a long history behind it, marked by some complications during the course of events.\n\nThe Kyivan empire, Rus’, comprised all tribes of the eastern Slavs, that is, the ancestors of the present Ukrainians, Belorussians and Russians. Similarly, the Kyivan Metropolia, i.e., the Church of Rus’, which belonged to the dioceses of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, from its very beginning until 1448 covered all territories of the eastern Slavs.\n\nIn the 13th century, the Kyivan empire was conquered by the Mongols. In 1240 they destroyed the capital, Kyiv, and then invaded the empire’s western and eastern provinces (principalities). The western provinces, with Kyiv, were controlled by the Mongols for about a century and the eastern provinces, with Moscow, for about two centuries.\n\nAs the Mongols withdrew from the western provinces, the Poles and Lithuanians moved in. In 1340, the Poles invaded Galicia. Following their example, the Lithuanians invaded all the rest of those lands that constitute the present territory of Ukraine. (Kyiv was occupied by the Lithuanians in 1362). Simultaneously they invaded those western provinces which constitute the present territories of Belorussia.\n\nUntil 1448, there was at least one link between the two zones of occupations, western (Polono-Lithuanian) and eastern (Mongolian),—namely, the Kyivan Metropolia, i.e., the Church of Rus’, which was in the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch (of Constantinople).\n\nFrom 1439 (when the Patriarch of Constantinople signed a declaration of union with Rome at the Council in Florence) until 1453 the Patriarch of Constantinople, to which the Kyivan Metropolia belonged, was in the jurisdiction of Rome.\n\nAs the grand duke of Moscovy repudiated that union, the eastern dioceses seceded from the Kyivan Metropolia, and the Council of Bishops in Moscow established the Church of Moscovy (1448).\n\nFrom this time on, the Kyivan Metropolia, i.e., the Church of Rus’, was confined to the territories of the Ruthenians (the ancestors of the Ukrainians and Belorussians, who called themselves Rusyny) that were occupied by the Poles and Lithuanians. Under the Mongol occupation, the rulers of Moscow imposed the name of their small province, Muscovy, on the zone of the Mongol occupation (the eastern provinces) as a whole.\n\nWith the liberation from the Mongol yoke (1480) the eastern provinces emerged as the state of Muscovy. In 1547, the grand duke of Muscovy, Ivan IY the Terrible, was crowned tsar. Later on, the Church of Muscovy was given the status of Patriarchate (1589).\n\nIn the western provinces (under the Polish and Lithuanian occupation) the situation of Orthodoxy was different.\n\nThe act of Lublin Union (1569) between Poland and Lithuania signified the subordination of Lithuania to Poland and the incorporation of the Lithuanian zone of occupation of the western east Slavic provinces, with Kyiv, into the territories of the Polish state. As a result, the Kyivan Metropolia, which constituted the Church of the Ruthenians (Rusyny) and was called the Church of Rus’ (Ruskaya Tserkva), found itself within the state boundaries of Poland. In this state with the Roman Catholic government, the history of the Kyivan Metropolia was the history of discrimination, persecutions and martyrdom.\n\nThe Patriarchy of Constantinople was not in the position to defend the Kyivan Metropolia because the Patriarchs of Constantinople practically became “Turkish prisoners.”\n\nWhen the Turks occupied Constantinople (1453) the Ecumenical Patriarchate’s union with Rome was annulled, and Orthodoxy was restored. However, all of those patriarchs who were not willing to meet the requirements of the Turkish government's policy died as martyrs.\n\nThat was the situation of the Kyivan Metropolia when the Council of Bishops was convened in Kyiv in 1685 to elect a new Metropolitan. Actually, the Council elected not a Metropolitan but a candidate; and the candidate was Hedeon (Swiatopolk-Chetvertynsky), Bishop of Lutsk. To his election was attached one unusual stipulation; namely, he was supposed to transfer the Kyivan Metropolia from the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople to that of the Patriarch of Moscow. The Metropolitan-elect immediately left for Moscow and was ordained by the Patriarch of Moscow, Ioakim, on November 8, 1685. In the course of the solemnities that took place in the patriarchal cathedral he accepted the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nIndeed, this act was uncanonical in nature, because the Orthodox Canons do not allow clergymen to leave their Primate without his permission. And the hierarchs of the Kyivan Metropolia with their Metropolitan left their Primate, the Patriarch of Constantinople, without his consent. Later on, in 1696, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Diony-sios, approved the act of subordination of the Kyivan Metropolia to the authority of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nIn 1924, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory YII, officially declared that the jurisdiction of the Patriarchy of Constantinople over the Kyivan Metropolia (i.e., the Church of the Ruthenians) had not been discontinued. “The first separation of the Kyivan Metropolia and the Orthodox Eparchies of Poland and Lithuania, that were subordinated to it, from Our See, and their incorporation into the Church of Muscovy came about through the violation of Canons,” Patriarch Gregory YII said in his Tomos (1924) — a document on which the status of autocephaly of the Orthodox Church in Poland was based. This autocephaly, granted by the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1924, did not separate the Orthodox Church of Poland from the Kyivan Metropolia, for the said document (Tomos) extends this same autocephaly over the dioceses which constituted the Kyivan Metropolia, i.e., the Church of Ruthenians during the period 1448-1686. In other words, the Patriarchal Tomos of 1924 authorized the See (in Warsaw) of the Orthodox Church in Poland to put into effect the extension of this autocephaly over the territories of the historical Kyivan Metropolia.\n\nDuring World War II, when German armies occupied Lithuania, Poland, Belorussia and Ukraine, with Kyiv, the See of the Orthodox Church of Poland, relying upon the 1924 Tomos of the Patriarch of Constantinople, practically restored the historical Kyivan Metropolia on the above-mentioned territories. The Primate of the Orthodox Church in Poland, Metropolitan Dionysios, with the cathedral in Warsaw, who was elected locum tenens of the Throne of the Kyivan Metropolia, governed this multi-national Church, covering the territories of a number of countries, with the assistance of his Synod and administrators. His administrator on the so-called “Reichsko-missariat Ukraina” whose dioceses covered the largest area of this multi-national Metropolia, was Metropolitan Policarp, Bishop of Lutsk. His office (Administratura), of course, did not imply any attributes of autocephaly whatsoever. Instead it points out the fact that this hierarch was in the jurisdiction of the Primate (Metropolitan Dionysios) of the Church which covered a number of different countries: Poland, Lithuania, Belorussia and Ukraine.\n\nThe administrative-political situation of Ukrainians was as follows: the Ukrainian lands to the west of the Buh and the Syan (rivers) and all of Halychyna were within the “General-Govern-merit” (in “Poland”), and there, among the Orthodox hierarchs, were also two Ukrainian hierarchs (in the jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Warsaw, Dionysios): Vladyka Ilarion (of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya) and Vladyka Palladiy (Vydybida-Rudenko)—Archbishop of Cracow and Lemkiwsh-chyna. The Ukrainian lands to the east of the Buh and beyond the boundaries of Halychyna made up the so-called “Reichskommissariat Ukraina”. — There was an official border between the “Reichskommissariat Ukraina” (including Kyiv) and the Ukrainian lands in the General-Government. The German authorities sternly prohibited the crossing of this border. The Church Administrator of these territories “Reichskommissariat Ukraina”) was Metropolitan Polikarp in the city of Lutsk (in Volyn’), who, together with the Bishops directly under bis authority, was in the jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Warsaw, Dionysios, the Primate of the autocephalous Orthodox Church on the Ukrainian and Byelorussian territories. On these Ukrainian lands (including Kyiv) the Ukrainian Orthodox dioceses under the direct leadership of the Metropolitan-Administrator Polikarp (Sikorsky) practically made up an autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church within the canonical jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Warsaw, Dionysios, the Primate of the Church that until 1939 was called the Orthodox Church in Poland. This was the Church (on the territories of Western Ukraine and Western Belorussia under the Polish rule) that was granted autocephaly in 1924 by the Tomos of the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nAt the End of the World War II\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, all those Ukrainian bishops who during the war were in the canonical jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Warsaw, Dionysios, emigrated: Metropolitan of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya, Ilarion, and Archbishop of Krakow and Lemkiwshchyna, Palladiy (both from the General-Government) and the Ukrainian Episcopate from the so-called “Reichskommissariat Ukraina”, where practically existed an autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the leadership of Metropolitan-Administrator, Polikarp. (Later, the Ukrainian Episcopate in emigration in the countries of Western Europe—specifically in Germany, under the leadership of Metropolitan Polikarp, formally proclaimed the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.)\n\nWhen the Ukrainian Episcopate of the so-called “Reichskommissariat Ukraina” went into emigration and was left in the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Polikarp, the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada turned to this Metropolitan with the request that he bless (allow) Archbishop Mstyslaw to leave his jurisdiction and assume the spiritual leadership of the Ukrainian Orthodox in Canada. When Metropolitan Polikarp agreed to meet this request, the Special Sobor of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada which took place in Saskatoon on November 12-13, 1947, formally invited Archbishop Mstyslaw to head this Church.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Metropolitan Dionysios, in whose direct jurisdiction Metropolitan Ilarion was then, found himself in the position of a prisoner of the new regime in Poland. The Moscow Patriarchate announced that it “annuls” the autocephaly granted the Orthodox Church in Poland by the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1924, and gives this Church autocephaly from itself. However, the canonicity of the Episcopate which was in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Warsaw during the Second World War was never called into question by anybody.\n\nHis Arrival in Canada\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion was brought from Switzerland to Canada by the Parish of St. Mary the Protectress (Pokrova) in Winnipeg, and he remained in this Parish from September 19, 1947, until the time he was elected to the See of the Metropolitan-Primate of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nThe Tenth Sobor of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada which took place in Saskatoon on June 18-20, 1950, recognized the resignation of its Primate, Archbishop Mstyslaw, who that very year (1950) was taken into the Episcopate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the U.S.A. led by Metropolitan John (Theodoro-vich). According to the decision of this Sobor, the leaders of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada turned to Metropolitan Polikarp (who resided in West Germany) with the request that he agree to give temporary spiritual sustenance to this Church until the time when the Consistory (commissioned by this Sobor) might find a candidate for permanent primacy.\n\nIf one wished to look into the history of Ukrainian theological thought for analogies or similarities, he would not fail to note the fact that, from the appearance of the monumental theological work of Zakharia Kopystensky entitled Palynodia (Resistance), written in the years 1619-1622, there was no equal work (to this work by Zakharia Kopystensky) in Ukrainian scholarly theological literature until the appearance of Metropolitan Ilarion’s work entitled The Division of the One Church of Christ and the First Attempts to Reunite It.\n\nThe monumental work by itself would be sufficient to confirm Metropolitan Ilarion’s name at the head of a new chapter in the history of Ukrainian scholarly theological thought. However, this work is mentioned here only in a symbolic sense, to show the way in which Metropolitan Ilarion understood and dealt with the essence of theology. For actually, Metropolitan Ilarion wrote many theological works—books, brochures and articles—which make up a large portion of his general contribution (over 1000 publications) to Ukrainian culture and scholarship.\n\n(2) Among those of Metropolitan Ilarion’s works whose topics deal with the national aspects of the Church of the Ukrainian people, we should first of all emphasize his historiographical works. In contrast to the stand of those scholars who—from the start—begin writing general synthetic works on the topic of the entire history of the Ukrainian Church, under the title “History of the Ukrainian Church,” Metropolitan Ilarion preferred, first of all, to thoroughly study separate periods of the history of our Church, taking note of the various aspects of that particular age in Ukraine (religious, political, cultural, and so on), and to publish such works in the form of special monographies. Finally, when these kinds of monographs make up a system of basic sources, it is possible to write a “History of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.” Representative of this kind of special historiographic monographs by Metropolitan Ilarion are his works entitled The Ukrainian Church in the Days of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (1647-1657) (Ukrayinska Tserkva za Bohdana Khmelnytskoho) and The Ukrainian Church in the Days of the Ruins (Ukrayinska Tserkva za chas Ruyiny).\n\nII. (1) There is an imposing number of popular scholarly works of a universal character among the acquisitions of Metropolitan Ilarion. As a matter of fact, some readers will probably find difficulty in finding criteria to distinguish his scholarly academic works from his works of a popular scholarly kind. This is because Metropolitan Ilarion, as a matter of principle, strove to convey his scholarly acquisitions to the reader by means of the most approachable method of teaching and by use of language commonly understood.\n\nWith regard to this, we should emphasize one especially noteworthy fact: Metropolitan was able to convey in a typical popular scholarly form the results of his study in the field of methodology of translating Holy Scripture and Service Books— results which make up a portion of the themes in his article entitled “The Methodology of Translation of Holy Scripture and Service Books into the Ukrainian Language” (Metodolohiya perekladu Sv. Pysma i Bohosluzhbovykh Knyh na ukrayinsku movu), published in issues 1927 of the journal Dukhovna Besida (Spiritual Talk) in 1927. This fact is interesting, because in scholarly work the methodology of translating the Bible is a relatively new, but very complicated, aspect of study. Among us, Metropolitan Ilarion himself paved the way in this field of work.\n\n(2) We find a great many popular scholarly works of the theological kind in the sphere of his study of the history of the Ukrainian Church. A part of the result of these studies, as a matter of interest, is given in a popular concise form as, for example, in the work entitled The Ukrainian Church Is First-Called (Ukrayinska Tserkva— Pervozvanna).\n\nTeacher of the New Age of the Rebirth of the Ukrainian Church\n\nWe generally understand the matter of “rebirth of the Ukrainian Church” in the sense of the revival of its ancient actual (but not canonical-jurisdictional) independence, with a projection of the need to fortify its jurisdictional status on the basis of autocephaly. On the Pan-Ukrainian ecclesiastical forum, Metropolitan Ilarion was the first to set the demand for the rebirth of the Ukrainian Church on the jurisdictional basis of autocephaly.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion set this demand in its full magnitude, and justified it in his talk on the subject “Rebirth of the Ukrainian Church” given by him at the Pan-Ukrainian Church Sobor in Kyiv on January 13, 1918. Later, in 1921, he formulated and justified this demand in the Request written by him and presented by the Government of the U.N.R. to the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nHowever, the idea of “rebirth of the Ukrainian Church” in the teachings of Metropolitan Ilarion does not mean simply the necessity of leading the Ukrainian Church to autocephalous status, but also the necessity of preserving its Orthodox essence and the revival of the better Ukrainian traditions in various aspects of its form.\n\nTo speak of the significance of the Mohyla Era in the history of the Ukrainian Church from a purely theological position, means to bear in mind the purifying of the essence of Orthodoxy in Ukraine from the non-Orthodox influences that had gradually crept into the fields of teaching of Faith, Divine Services, Ritual and others, during the long period of hard times that it had undergone, due to the assault upon it of various hostile forces.\n\nMetropolitan Petro Mohyla wrote in the Preface to the Book of Needs (“Trebnyk”—Church Service Book containing the order of Holy Mysteries and other rites), published by the “Atenaeum” in 1646, that non-Orthodox influences had crept into our Church in Ukraine and Byelorussia “by the in-cautiousness of the scribes” (that is, the incautious-ness of our copyists of Church Books), and also because of the fact that during the time when we had no Bishops (because of prohibition by the Polish authorities), those “who took it upon themselves to censor such books and publish them for the world, did not have much knowledge about such matters, and took little heed of what constituted the essence of Mysteries, and what constituted the form, caring more for their own gain, and for this reason they omitted many essential things, and added many that were non-essential.”\n\nThus, Metropolitan Petro Mohyla made his chief goal the purification of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine and Belorussia of non-Orthodox influences. This means that he strove to revive the Orthodox Church in these countries in the sense of purifying its Orthodox essence of non-Orthodox influences. After Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, there were no more efforts made in this field until the time of Metropolitan Ilarion.\n\nOrdained a Bishop\n\nOn the occasion of his ecclesiastical episcopal Election, solemnized on October 19, 1940, Archimandrite Ilarion (in the world, Professor Ivan Ohienko), in his speech on the subject “The Difficult Tasks of a Ukrainian Hierarch” (Vazhki zavdannya ukrayinskoho arkhyiereya), emphasized especially these points of his ideology with regard to the national aspects of the Church of the Ukrainian people: (1) The Ukrainian Church is a First-Called Church, because its Founder was the Apostle Andrew, the First-Called, himself. (2) The Ukrainian Church is self-reliant because it is characterized by many formal Ukrainian specifics. (3) The Ukrainian Church is governed conciliarily (i.e. by Sobors, that is, Councils).\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion was profoundly convinced that the maintaining of national specifics in Church forms could in no way violate the essence of the Church—the essence of the Orthodox Faith.\n\nIn conjunction with this Chirotony, which was conferred upon him on October 20, 1940, he took an obligatory oath to faithfully follow all the dogmas and canons of the Universal Holy Orthodox Church, as they are set forth in the Book of Rules. He also presented this oath in written form to the Hierarchs who conferred the Chirotony upon him.\n\nA Translator of Church Texts\n\nConstantly defending Ukrainian national attributes in the forms of Church life of the Ukrainian people, Metropolitan Ilarion followed with conviction and devotion the essence of the Orthodox Faith in all aspects: dogmatic, canonical, Divine Service, and so on. No one in the history of the Ukrainian Church worked more than he in the field of accurate publication of Divine Service Books. And be also translated the greatest number of Divine Service Books into the Ukrainian language.\n\nThe beginning of Metropolitan Ilarion’s work in Church translations is dated to 1917, when he— student Ivan Ohienko—edited in Kyiv Archbishop Oleksiy Dorodnytsia’s Prayerbook in the Ukrainian Language (Molytovnyk ukrayinskoyu movoyu) and included in this Prayer Book several prayers of his own translation.\n\nBeginning in 1921, when he published his translation of several Prayers, School Prayers (Shkilni molytvy) in Tarnow, Metropolitan Ilarion, during the remaining 36 years, has given us 44 translations of Divine Service Books—a record which is equalled by very few in the history of Christianity.\n\nThe matter of translating is not simply a matter of translating sounds, but also a matter of accurate conveying of thoughts. In order that the translation not become a “free interpretation” of the text of Divine Service Books (which would threaten the authenticity of their contents), the translator must be not only a good linguist and aesthetestylist, but also a good theologian. The fact that the name Professor Ivan Ohienko, and later the name Metropolitan Ilarion, became synonymous with the idea of translation of Divine Service Books into the Ukrainian language, must be studied not only in the light of purity of Ukrainian language, but also in the light of purity of the Orthodox Faith, whose identity is now so threatened by various conjunctival “interpretations” accommodated to all sorts of “practical needs” (social, political, and so on), just as it was threatened by heterodox influences and the spirit of indifference in the days when Metropolitan Petro Mohyla—who clearly saw the need to purify our Divine Service Books and theological works from non-Orthodox influences— lived and worked. The work of Metropolitan Petro Mohyla along the lines of that purification was the Rebirth of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine and Byelorussia. In our times, the age of such a rebirth of the Church of the Ukrainian Orthodox was begun and led by Metropolitan Ilarion. In the monthly, Slovo Istyny (Word of Truth)—published by Metropolitan Ilarion in 1947-1951—he paid thorough attention to the matter of necessity of following the dogmas and canons of the Orthodox Church, which he explained to his readers in an expansive, thorough and popular manner. He also placed special emphasis on the history of the Orthodox Liturgy, on the essence and form of the Holy Mysteries, on the teachings of the Holy Church Fathers, and so on. He spoke consistently, logically and clearly, affirming that there is no Orthodoxy where the truth and teachings of the Universal Orthodox Church are not followed—in their entirety, or even in part.\n\nBeginning with the teaching about the essence of Orthodoxy (explained by him in the work The Orthodox Faith— “Vira Pravoslavna”), through the explanation of the essence of the Cross (in the work The Sign of the Cross— “Khresne Znamennya”), the essentials of the veneration of Holy Icons (in the work Iconoclasm—”Ikonoborstvo”), the spirit of divineness of the Holy Mystery of Baptism (in the work The Mystery of Baptism of the Orthodox Church—“Tayinstvo Khreshchennya Pravoslavnoyi Tserkvy”), the normative aspects of the Holy Liturgy (in the work How to Celebrate the Holy Liturgy—“Yak pravyty Sv. Liturhiyu”), and many other things, and ending with practical suggestions for worshippers (in the work How to Conduct Oneself in the Temple of God—“Yak povodytysya v Bozhomu Khrami”), Metropolitan Ilarion spanned the whole sphere of Orthodoxy by his Archpastoral teachings, also placing special emphasis on the ethical imperatives of the Gospel, as is only right, for these are inseparable from the concept of Orthodoxy. Many Ukrainians know the familiar pastoral imperative of Metropolitan Ilarion, which is most popular in its shortened version: “To serve’ the people is to serve God.” And to serve the people means to serve one’s neighbour, to serve every man, because to love is to serve, explains Metropolitan Ilarion in his work entitled To Serve the People Is to Serve God (Sluzhyty narodu—to sluzhyty Bohu).\n\nIncreasing Theological Education\n\nThe profoundness of Metropolitan Ilarion’s understanding of his calling in the field of Christian Mission is shown, by the way, by the following significant fact of a “circumstantial character.” Everyone knows that Professor Ivan Ohienko was the one who led the movement for the Ukrainian-ization of the language of Divine Services, in the sense that the Liturgy was celebrated in the contemporary Ukrainian literary language. This was one of the very foundations of his national ideology in the Ukrainian Church. However, when the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian Orthodox in Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya desired that the old Divine Service language (so called “Church-Slavonic” language” with the Ukrainian Pronunciation be allowed to remain in the Holy Liturgy, because it sounded “extraordinary” to them, and when the First Diocesan Sobor of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya (which took place in Kholm in the days of October 19-21, 1941) expressed its approval of this matter by the first item among its resolutions, Metropolitan Ilarion did not hesitate to give his blessing for this decision, because otherwise it might have weakened the feeling of attachment the inhabitants of these old Ukrainian districts to the atmosphere of their Orthodox Church.\n\nOne of the first tasks of Vladyka Metropolitan Ilarion, as Archbishop of Kholmshchyna and Pidlyashya, was to accomplish the matter of establishing an Orthodox school. And soon, in 1941, a religious seminary was founded there, which in 1942 was elevated to the level of a religious academy, whose professors were qualified Ukrainian Orthodox theologians.\n\nWherever Metropolitan Ilarion served as Arch-pastor, there always was a Ukrainian Orthodox theological school, and Metropolitan Ilarion’s spirit created in this institution the necessary religious atmosphere which ruled over all Political groupings. In the grandeur of this atmosphere, the students knew their direction—without hesitation, doubts, apathy and indifference—because this was the atmosphere of the Christian Faith. The students devoutly respected their Archpastor. This respect was not forced, for its foundation was their sincere devotedness and love towards him. And it was indeed a rare occurrence if any of them, after being educated in this religious atmosphere, later hesitated to go to serve in Christ’s Vineyard—to serve not as politician, nor as a professional, nor as a public figure, but to serve as a Priest, as the servant of Christ who stands above social classes, parties and organizations.\n\nNothing that was “human” was outside the bounds of the attention of Metropolitan Ilarion. Where many considered Communism to be merely a matter of collectives, “capitalism of the state,” totalitarianism, and so on, Metropolitan Ilarion for his part approached the essence of Communism in a more profound way. He felt that it was an obvious fact that the essence of Communism consisted in its world-view with its “materialized psychology” and its fanatical faith in materialism. For this very reason, he had not the slightest doubt that, as he emphatically stated, “there is no new ideology against Communism; the One Teaching of Christ can stand against Communism” (the journal, Vira y Kultura—“Faith and Culture,” No. 6 (4). Winnipeg, 1957).\n\nHowever, it is understood that only those people can stand up against Communism through Christ’s Teachings, who believe in the existence of God and live according to Christ’s Teachings, and nowhere and never hesitate to openly confess the Christian Faith.\n\nThe Man Who Accomplished the Second Translation of the Bible in the History of the Ukrainian Church\n\nThe first translation of the Bible into the Ukrainian language, in the history of the Ukrainian people and the history of their Church, was completed in the nineteenth century by Panteleimon Kulish. This translation first appeared in print in 1903, in a rather meagre quantity. At that time the norms of the Ukrainian universal literary language were not yet completely settled. Besides, at that time the methodology of translating the Bible did not stand at the high level it does today. P. Kulish, on his part, tried to do the best that he could in the circumstances of his time, with regard to the state, at that time, of the Ukrainian literary language and the methodology of translating Holy Scripture.\n\nThis translation of the Bible is distinguished by three special characteristics: (1) the quality of the Ukrainian language, (2) the rhythmic quality of the sentences, and (3) the accurate rendering of the meaning.\n\n(1) Among the distinguished Ukrainian linguists, Metropolitan Ilarion was foremost in his knowledge of the Ukrainian language. Besides this, he placed special emphasis on expressing thoughts in the most comprehensible way possible; he himself had the special gift of expressing complex thoughts in a way that all could understand. All this taken together shows that the language of his translation of the Bible is a classical type of the contemporary Ukrainian literary language and that the majestic Biblical simplicity of expression is not thereby violated (by him).\n\n(2) In the translation of the Bible completed by Metropolitan Ilarion, the rhythmic quality of the original is kept intact (this characteristic is quite rare in the history of translations of the Bible). Being himself a poet, Metropolitan Ilarion did not only focus attention on the meaning of words and the logical development of sentences, but also on the poetic particularities of Biblical expression, including the rhythmic quality of sentences. To Preserve this rhythmic quality of the sentences without changing the grammatical norms of the Ukrainian language, the Biblical style and the accurate presentation of thoughts is a difficult task.\n\n(3) Nevertheless, the most difficult matter in the translation of the Bible is accurate rendering of meaning. Words exist that have several (plausible) meanings. The difficulty here is to determine what meaning was used to render a thought in Hebrew for the Old Testament and in Greek (Koine) for the New Testament. Besides this, one must take into consideration whether a given expression in the original stood for a poetic figure, or perhaps to clearly convey a thought or idea. Without a proper knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and without an understanding of the spirit of the time when the Old Testament and the New Testament were written, the translator can not render his assignment properly.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion began a thorough study of Hebrew and Greek (as well as Latin and Church-Slavonic) while yet in his student days. The ‘beginnings of the preparation for translating the Bible can be dated from the year 1917.\n\nBesides the constant study of these languages (of interest is the fact that Metropolitan Ilarion deepened his study of Hebrew under the tutelage of a famous Hebrew scholar in Warsaw between the two World Wars), Metropolitan Ilarion also studied various areas of the life of ancient Israel: its history, religion, culture, world-view, traditions, customs, laws, ethnopsychology, and so on. In addition, he studied various aspects of the period when the New Testament was written. These kind of studies are an integral part of the scholarly methodology of translating the Bible.\n\nThe Greek Church prohibited the translation of the Bible from early Greek (Koine) into modern Greek, because of the fear that translators would unintentionally insert into the text of Holy Scripture thoughts which were not found in the original. Inaccurate translations of the Bible actually do contain a smaller or larger quantity of such thoughts, which in reality are not Biblical. Thus, the Greek Church became very cautious in this field for their Church leadership sees many contradictions among the various translations of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nIn order to avoid errors, Metropolitan Ilarion prepared himself for a considerable length of time before undertaking such an important and responsible task as the translation of the Bible into the Ukrainian language. His translation is in reality the work of that period of his life which began with his university studies.\n\nHis sporadic attempts at translation, between 1917 and 1925, must be looked at in light of his simultaneous work in the area of methodology of translating Holy Scripture and Divine Service Books. His studies and then simultaneous transla-tion of the Bible, beginning in 1921, became systematized. This is shown by the fact that up to 1927 Metropolitan Ilarion was able to prepare the basis of the methodology of (Biblical) translation, on which he reported in his article “Methodology of Translating the Bible and Divine Service Books into the Ukrainian Language” (Metodolohiya perekladu Sv. Pysma y Bohosluzhbovykh knyh na ukrayinsku movu), published in 1927, issues 19-27 of the journal Dukhovna Besida (Spiritual Talk). The contract for the right to translate the Bible into the Ukrainian language was signed by Professor I. Ohienko with the British and Foreign Bible Society on April 1, 1936. From that time on, he concentrated almost entirely on translating Holy Scripture. In 1937 his translation of the Gospels appeared (in Lviv)—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In 1939 his translation of the entire New-Testament with the addition of the Psalms appeared in Warsaw. The translation of the entire Bible was completed on July 11, 1940; however, due to the second World War the manuscripts could not be delivered for printing. After the war various circumstances including, later, procedural formalities (revision committee, and so on), dragged out this important work to March 14, 1955. This date marks the formal agreement with the British and Foreign Bible Society to accept this translation for printing, which was completed in April 1958. As the author of the first scholarly translation of the Bible into the Ukrainian language, Metropolitan Ilarion was named Honorary Member of the British and Foreign (Bible) Society.\n\nThe goal of this great work, to which Metropolitan Ilarion devoted the most time, attention and energy throughout forty years of his life—the work of translating the Bible—had an exclusively missionary character. He wanted the Ukrainian people to have the Possibility of reading the Holy Scriptures in an accurate and comprehensible translation into the Ukrainian literary language. When it happened that as a result of the second World War a large number of Ukrainian refugees found themselves in various Western European countries, they received free of charge (in 1946-1947) hundreds of copies of the Gospels in Ukrainian translation from Metropolitan Ilarion.\n\nA Solitary Religious Thinker\n\nThe Holy Fathers of the Church were not merely learned theologians but also religious thinkers (philosophers). In the late periods of the Middle Ages, religious thinking was highly developed even in the western countries of Europe. Traces of religious (philosophical) thinking can be found also in the early Ukrainian Orthodox theologians and in Church writers. After a century of flowering in the sphere of Ukrainian religious literature of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, religious thinking in Ukraine started to decline. For this very reason, Metropolitan Ilarion, as a religious thinker, became a solitary figure among us in this regard.\n\nThe reflective gift and inclination, which can be seen in many aspects of Metropolitan Ilarion’s works, belong to the essential characteristics of his personality. This fact can be illustrated by examples even from such spheres, in which, before Metropolitan Ilarion, none among us sought any objectives of philosophical thinking.\n\nOnly now, for example, do we consider it possible to discuss such questions as: Can or can not Ukrainians in diaspora maintain their national identity (individuality) without the preservation of their native language? Aside from this, we are used to hearing only about the memorization of Ukrainian words and phraseology, about the teaching of Ukrainian grammar and orthography, and similar things, because all of these things are necessary to preserve the Ukrainian language as a means of communication among Ukrainians.\n\nHowever, Ukrainians heard from Professor I. Ohienko that the matter of language is not only a matter of dictionary, grammar, phraseology, linguistic styles, orthography, and so on, because at the essence of native language lies something more profound.\n\nLanguage is “the soul of every nationality,” said he in his work entitled Ukrainian Culture (Ukrayinska kultura), written in 1918.\n\nAs a linguist, he develops his professional study of the Ukrainian language (its morphology, lexicon, syntax, tonic accent, history, and so on) to the level where the interest and competence of academic professional linguists end. However, Metropolitan Ilarion does not stop here; as a thinker, he goes further and tells us figuratively: “The language is the soul of every nationality.” Here he enters the sphere of philosophy of native language, which he examines in the light of the substance of nationality.\n\nBeing a thinker, Metropolitan Ilarion primarily concentrated his thought in the sphere of religion. For him, the poetic form is only a means which serves his reflective objective. And that objective lies in his expression of those truths which are revealed to him in the mirror of his intuition.\n\nThe common thread between poetry and philosophy is formed by the fact that both poet and philosopher strive to understand the highest essence of being by the path of intuition. It is for this very reason that all philosophers utilized, to a greater or lesser extent, the poetic form of expression.\n\nReligion is a matter not only of the rational aspect of man’s spirit, but also a matter of his will and feelings, that is, a matter of the whole soul. And religious poetry emerges first of all from religious feelings, which assist the mind of the believer to reach intuitively towards the essence of the most profound truths of being. And for this very reason, religious poetry sometimes resembles prayer.\n\nIn the preface to the first volume of his Philosophical Mysteries (Filosofski misteriyi), Metropolitan Ilarion explains Why the Bible contains many poetical resources of expression; why the Psalms were created in the form of religious poetry; why the Holy Fathers of the Church conveyed their knowledge of truths through religious-poetical works.\n\nJust as in the area of Ukrainology, his chief aim is to strive to reveal the substance or essence of the Ukrainian nationality, and for this reason he concentrated so much on the matter of the Ukrainian language and culture (as shown by the titles of journals he edited in Warsaw: Ridna Mova— “Native Language,” and Nasha Kultura—”Our Culture”), so also in religious thinking he concentrates chiefly on the matter of truth and the relationship between Faith and culture, in which, naturally, he includes the sphere of learning. From this come the names of the journals that he Published in Winnipeg: first Slovo Istyny—”Word of Truth” (1947-1951) and later on the journal Vira i Kultura—”Faith and Culture” (from 1953 on). In between the two, in the years 1951-1953, he published in Winnipeg the journal Nasha Kultura—”Our Culture.”\n\nThe aim of so-called “pure science” (or as they say, “science for the sake of science”) is to strive to discover the mysteries of nature, or generally speaking to disclose reality (truth), without any thought as to what practical aim that finding or disclosure of truth might be used for. But it is important for a Christian scholar that his discoveries serve the good of humanity.\n\nAs a learned humanist and theologian, Metropolitan Ilarion always endeavoured to discover the truth (reality). And he did this without fear, not paying attention to the fact that on more than one occasion he had to experience a considerable amount of unpleasantness and even tragedy.\n\nIn his Philosophical Mysteries (Filosofski misteriyi), written in poetic-verse form, he especially emphasizes that fact that historians manifest to a greater or lesser extent, consciously or unconsciously, the tendency to show historical facts in such a light that people are no longer able to find out what the far-removed events were really like.\n\nThis is what Metropolitan Ilarion says of this (tendency):\n\n“And all ‘true history’\n\nThat claims to strike Truth home to the eyes Is like the weather that always changes,\n\nJust as the mood of the author desires.”\n\nIn Ukrainian popular language the word “truth” (pravda) means also the affirmation of reality and justice. Both of these meanings of “truth” are used also by Taras Shevchenko. How may one harmonize in the one word (“pravda”) the affirmation of reality and the meaning of justice?\n\nIn his work The Birth of Man (Narodzhennya lyudyny), Metropolitan Ilarion replies to this question thus:\n\n“The Lord is the Truth most Perfect; There is no crumb of evil in Him.”\n\nOnly belief in the existence of God and life according to the teachings of Christ will enable man to resolve the problem of the interrelation of the recognition of reality and justice, which are denoted by one term “truth,” and in this case, by the term “Divine Truth.”\n\nHis Grace Bishop Theodosios speaks on behalf of His Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras and Archbishop lakovos. He said:\n\n“On behalf of His Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras, on behalf of His Eminence Archbishop lakovos of North and South America, on behalf of Clergy and Laity of the Greek Archiocese of North and South America I would like to express our sympathy to our Sister Ukrainian Church.\n\nWe pray that Almighty God will rest in peace the soul of His servant Metropolitan Ilarion.\n\nMay his memory be eternal! May his memory be eternal! May his memory be eternal!\n\nThe world is very complex and interesting because it is a cosmic mystery. God gave man intelligence so that he would understand the world. For this reason, belief in the existence of God and pious living do not contradict the matter of science. But science can not reveal everything to us. For example, the human brain will never recognize this Divine Mystery: God’s aim in creating the world and the final goal of man’s life. Believers are aware that these mysteries are known only to God.\n\nIt is thus that we must understand that basis on which true science can not be in collision with Faith; concerning this Metropolitan Ilarion speaks thus in the above-mentioned work:\n\n“Learning and Faith are dear sisters, And Truth is their own dear mother — ‘Though in life sometimes they go different paths, They always arrive at the common Palace.”\n\nThis same idea is expressed by him in yet another version:\n\n“Knowledge is a road to Truth; It is laid by the sons of God — In learning we draw nearer to God, And God thereby draws nearer to us.”\n\nTo learn, to recognize reality, and at the same time, to live virtuously, to love one’s neighbour, to forgive one’s enemies and to rely upon God because only He knows the highest mysteries of the world, including the mystery of the goal of man’s being.\n\nThe object of man’s being—this is a question (similar to the question of truth) which has perturbed philosophers from antiquity.\n\nIn his work The Divinization of Man (Obozhen-nya lyudyny), Metropolitan Ilarion teaches that only the believing person can recognize the goal of his being on the earth; this goal is the divinization (transfiguration) of man, that is, the drawing nearer to the essence of God, as far as it is possible for man; to draw nearer by means, at the same time, of a pious life and faith in God’s Providence. Believing and pious persons feel no need to ask about the aim with Which God created them.\n\nThe above-mentioned examples, to a partial extent, illustrate for us the themes of Metropolitan Ilarion’s religious-philosophical thinking.\n\nWhen the sermons of Metropolitan Ilarion are published (probably this year) the future researcher will have the complete material upon which the fullness of his (the Metropolitan’s) “spiritual portrait” as a religious thinker will be painted.\n\nA Pioneer In The Sphere Of Ukrainian Learning\n\nIn the area of Ukrainiology there are subjects which did not exist until Metropolitan Ilarion’s time. They exist today due to the pioneering work of Metropolitan Ilarion. Thus, he belongs to the most distinguished pioneers of Ukrainology. With regard to this, let us mention as examples at least several of the most important facts.\n\nThe author of the first synthetical work on the theme of Ukrainian culture is Professor I. Ohieriko. This work, entitled Ukrainian Culture (Ukrayinska kultura) was published in 1918.\n\nThe History of Ukrainian Printing (Istoriya ukrayinskoho drukarstva) published in 1925 is the first work on this theme which spans the entire history of Ukrainian printing. This monumental work was written by Prof. I. Ohienko.\n\nUp to the year 1927, there was no work on the methodology of translating Holy Scripture and Divine Service Books into the Ukrainian language. Professor I. Ohienko was the first to write a scholarly study on the subject, published in 1927.\n\nThe History of Ukrainian Literary Language (Istoriya ukrayinskoyi literaturnoyi movy), published in 1950, is a work of Metropolitan Ilarion’s which filled a deep gap in this field, because prior to Metropolitan Ilarion there was no systematic study on the history of our literary language.\n\nSuch an important matter in the history of the Ukrainian people as its pre-Christian religion was not a subject of expansive and profound study up to the time when it was undertaken by Metropolitan Ilarion (while in Lauzanne). He wrote a large monograph on this subject entitled Pre-Christian Beliefs of the Ukrainian People (Dokhrystiyanski viruvannya ukrayinskoho narodu). The first study on the topic of the lexical resources in the creative works of Taras Shevchenko was written by Metropolitan Ilarion. This work is entitled The Dictionary of Shevchenko’s Language (Slovnyk Shevchenko-voyi movy). The first monograph on the topic Ukrainian Literary Tonic Accent (Ukrayinsky literaturny naholos) is the work of Metropolitan Ilarion. In addition, we must underline that he continually devoted special attention to the study of the Ukrainian tonic accent. He specialized in this area from the very beginning of his work in the field of Ukrainian learning. In his lectures (the course “History of the Eastern-Slavic Tonic Accent”) at St. Volodymyr University in Kyiv in 1916, Prof. I. Ohienko devoted much attention to the Ukrainian tonic accent.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion was first to become interested in the religious motifs in the themes and literary style of the works of Taras Shevchenko, and he placed special emphasis on them in his monograph entitled The Religiousness of Taras Shevchenko (Relihiynist Tarasa Shevchenka).\n\nDue to the fact that the number of Metropolitan Ilarion’s publications is expressed in over a thousand titles, it is not possible to list here all of the areas of Ukrainology whose beginnings are ascribed to the initiative and work of Metropolitan Ilarion.\n\nThe figure of Metropolitan Ilarion as a scholar became well-known as the figure of a great scholar on a world-wide scale. With regard to this, we must underline the fact that those among his greatest works which have an international significance for example, Beginnings of the Alphabet and Literary Language among the Slavs (Pochatky azbuky i literaturnoyi movy v slovyan) and especially Constantine and Methodius (Konstyantyn i Mefodiy), 1927-1928, to which no other nation has an equal—are related with the history of the Church.\n\nThe distinguished German Slavist, Prof. Pauls, correctly emphasized in his Grammar of the Church-Slavonic Language that the works of Prof. I. Ohienko contain an enormous number of scholarly sources. It is indeed true that he (Prof. I. Ohienko) studied many thousands of scholarly works in the process of his own scholarly research. In addition, it will be to the point to note the fact that his monograph entitled The Methodology of Scholarly Work (Metodolohiya naukovoyi pratsi) is the only study of its kind on this topic. (This work, as well as many other works by Metropolitan Ilarion, has not yet been published).\n\nAcademic Associations\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion was a member of the following learned institutions before the first World War:\n\nScholarly Society in Kyiv;\n\nThe Society of Nestor the Chronicler in Kyiv;\n\nSociety of Lovers of Early Literary Works in Petersburg;\n\nArchival Commission in Kyiv;\n\nMilitary Archival Commission in Kyiv;\n\nArchival Commission in Katerynoslav.\n\nIn the period between the two World Wars he was a member of the following learned centres:\n\nThe Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian Scholarly Society in Lviv;\n\nThe Commission on the History of Bibliology in Kyiv (named a member in 1926);\n\nThe Slavic Institute of Prague; and\n\nThe Polish Linguistic Society.\n\nFollowing World War II:\n\nThe Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian Scholarly Society (transferred from Lviv to the emigration) ;\n\nUkrainian Free Academy of Learning (in emigration);\n\nThe Research Institute of Volyn’ in Winnipeg;\n\nThe Scholarly-Theological Society in Winnipeg;\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society in London.\n\nHis Numerous Publications\n\nA list of names of Prof. I. Ohienko’s scholarly publications during his first twenty years of academic work (1905-1925) is given in the following source: V. Zayikyna: Prof. Ivan Ohienko during His Twenty Years of Work: 1905-1925. (A list of works by Prof. I. Ohienko) (Prof. Ivan Ohienko za dvadtsyat lit pratsi: 1905-1925). This list was published in the July to December issues of the journal Dukhovna Besida (Spiritual Talk) in Warsaw, 1925.\n\nFollowing this Prof. I. Korovytsky completed in retrospect the above-mentioned list of Prof. I. Ohienko’s publications (beginning from 1897) and took it to the year 1937. This list is included as part of an article of Prof. I. Korovytsky entitled “The Work of a Scholar” (Chyn uchenoho), which was published in the book entitled A Scholarly Collection on the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Scholarly Work of Prof. Dr. I. Ohienko (Naukovy zbirnyk v 30 richnytsiu naukovoyi Pratsi Prof. D-ra Ivana Ohienka), Warsaw, 1937.\n\nAfter a year of research (1957-1958), Prof. Dr. G. Mulyk-Lucyk established that the two above-mentioned published lists (1925 and 1937) were incomplete. He corrected the list of omitted (because forgotten) publications of Metropolitan Ilarion during the period between 1897 and 1937, added their titles to the list published in 1937, and presented all this to Metropolitan Ilarion. He terminated his work on the bibliography of Metropolitan Ilarion’s works, as well as his work on the bibliography of this bibliography, because at that time (1957) there were some forty-two unpublished works of Metropolitan Ilarion’s and there was no one to publish them. In time, several of these were jointly Published by the Society “Volyn’ ” in Winnipeg and the Research Institute of Volyn’ in Winnipeg. After this, Metropolitan Ilarion presented all his unpublished works to the Society “Volyn’ ” which publishes them periodically and also republishes those of his works which are no longer available and now belong to the list of rare publications.\n\nWe do not have the list of Metropolitan Ilarion’s works during the period from 1937 to the present time. And there are a great many of these works (books, brochures and articles).\n\nA Ukrainologist\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion approached the sphere of Ukrainology not only as an ordinary scholar—a “professional” or specialist—but also as a scholar and patriot. As a scholar, he strictly followed the scholarly method of research, which in the first place requires objectivity. As a patriot, he chose for himself, first of all, areas of scholarly research which were connected with the primary needs of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHistory shows that even upon the ruins of Russian Tsarism (which fell in 1917 due to the Revolution), the act of Ukrainian sovereignty by the proclamation of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 was not an easy matter to achieve. But it was even more difficult to transform our ethnos (a people as such) into a nation—into a monolithic community, aware of its name, selfhood, individuality and unity.\n\nWithout the transformation of the people, as an ethnic mass, into a nation, it was not possible to build a state in the situation in which Ukraine found itself in 1918.\n\nTherefore, when the opportunity arose, on the horizon of the Revolution in the Russian Tsarist empire, for Ukraine to achieve state independence, Prof. I. Ohienko left his scholar’s cabinet and went to serve Ukraine in a practical manner—to work in the field of spiritual self-liberation of his people by means of its transformation into a nation.\n\nIn the year 1918, he published his work—of an epochal significance—entitled Ukrainian Culture, the first edition of which was published in 100,000 copies and the second (printed especially for the Ukrainian army) in a million copies. Prof. I. Ohienko’s first task was to tell the millions of his people that they possessed one common language and one common culture which distinguish them from all other nations and constitute the essence of Ukrainian nationality.\n\n“I will inform you about the Ukrainian culture, about the ages-old culture of our people as a nation, about the culture that it has arrived at by a long road,” said Prof. I. Ohienko to his nation in 1918 (Ukrainian Culture, p. 4).\n\nIn the years 1917 and 1918, he wrote and published the following texts which were of primary necessity: Ukrainian Writing—grammar (Ukrayinske pysannya), an edition published in some million copies, and A Course in the Ukrainian Language (Kurs ukrayinskoho yazyka), and a handbook entitled The Ukrainian Language (Ukrayinska mova).\n\nThe matter of Ukrainian unity required much effort in the area of practical Ukrainology.\n\nEspecially was it necessary to work out a common orthography, universal for all Ukrainians. The Government of Hetman Pavlo SkoroPadsky entrusted this matter to Prof. I. Ohienko.\n\nBut to develop universal grammatical norms of the Ukrainian language and a universal orthography—one of the most important tasks of Prof. Ohienko—was not the whole of it. A universal language is the most important formal mark of a nation. However, the native language is a matter of a national substance.\n\n“Language is our national mark; in our language lies our culture, the level of our consciousness,” he wrote in 1918.\n\n“Language is the form of our life— cultural and national life—it is the form of national organization. Language is the soul of every nationality, her sacred possession, her most valuable sacred possession, her most precious treasure . . . Of course, not merely the language, but the language as a specific organ of culture, tradition. In language lie our early and new culture and the mark of our national profession. Language is not merely a simple symbol of understanding, because it evolves in a specific culture, in a specific tradition. In such a case, the language is the clearest expression of our psychology; it is the prime guardian of our psychological ego . . . And as long as the language exists, the nation exists also, as a nationality. If the language dies, neither will the nationality remain: for it will become dispersed within some stronger nation. This is the reason why language has such great importance in a national movement; this is why it is placed in the first position of honour among our most important questions. This is why our enemies have always been so concerned to prohibit our language, to bring it low, to utterly destroy it.” (Ukrainian Culture, pp. 240-41).\n\nThus spoke the greatest linguist-Ukrainologist to his people. None before him nor after him spoke thus to our people about our native language— about language as an “expression of the national Psychology,” about the native language as the “soul of every nationality.”\n\nHe spoke thus in order to reveal to his people the secret of self-preservation of a nation, in order to show the people that state independence must be founded on the awareness of the people about its national-spiritual independence, and that the geographic-political unity of a people must be based on spiritual unity. Because only the awareness of a people of its national-spiritual independence and unity has the power to transform it into a nation. During the time when Ukraine found itself under occupations, and when, during the course of centuries, she lost her leadership almost entirely, and our people were almost entirely reduced to the level of the so-called “third class” (peasantry), to the level of enslavement in the national-political, religious-political, cultural, social and economic aspects—at this time Professor I. Ohienko spoke out to his oppressed people about the lofty culture of their forefathers who civilized the entire Slavic East. And he showed that the Church and culture of the Russian Tsarist empire was based upon the groundwork which was long in preparation for Ukrainian “plowmen”—the spiritual missionaries, scholars, writers and technicians. He first spoke of this to our people in 1918, as the author of Ukrainian Culture. Afterwards he repeated this more expansively in a series of his other works— both large and small.\n\nThese words of Metropolitan Ilarion’s enfold us with the spirit of Messianism of our forefathers: that spirit which the author of the Tale of Ihor’s Campaign (Slovo o polku Ihorevi) was filled by in the twelfth century—he who showed his contemporaries their greatest mission: “the defense of Christians before the heathen.”\n\nDuring the course of centuries, our knights of the Royal and Kozak (historic) eras protected the Christian nations of the West from the hordes of enemy forces. But the missionaries and scholars of our forefathers carried the Cross, Gospel and the word of learning to the far East of Europe—and Prof. I. Ohienko showed this fact to his unfortunate people to strengthen its spirit, faith in its powers and in its historical calling.\n\nHis Great Legacy And Our Great Debt\n\nBehind Metropolitan Ilarion’s short maxims, some of which have already become familiar to all of us—for example: “To serve the people is to serve God”; “To love is to serve”; “Language is the soul of a nation,” and others—lies the great parity of his works. All of these maxims are his testaments. An especially essential and important great testament for us in the great diaspora is his Book of Our Being in a Foreign Land (Knyha nashoho buttya na Chuzhyni). These are his commandments to us: how to preserve our nationality in our dispersion in the dense mass of other nationalities.\n\nCompared to many other peoples, our mass “exodus” from Ukraine is still relatively recent. Thus, there was not much time for us to recognize within ourselves the great losses due to massive assimilation in massive societies composed of other nationalities. And that feeling of “security” turned our thoughts away from the need of an ideology of self-preservation in such surroundings. But without such an ideology, it is almost impossible to find successful methods of national self-preservation.\n\nArchbishop Michael, Acting Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada, places into the coffin of Metropolitan Ilarion a small container of soil brought from Ukraine.\n\nIf anyone wanted to express the entire contents of the Book of Our Being in a Foreign Land in one sentence, he could express it by Metropolitan Ilarion’s well-known imperative: “Let us love everything that is our own!” This means: let us love our language, our native Church, our culture, our customs, our history, our forefathers and our descendants—let us love our people!\n\n“To love all our own” means to be a patriot. To try to seed the knowledge of the Ukrainian language, literature and history on soil where there is no patriotism—this is the “task of Sisyphus”—a futile endeavour. Where there is no Ukrainian patriotism, there is the spiritual “rocky ground” in which the seed of the native language will not germinate; and even if it does germinate, then it will sprout with difficulty, grow a little and quickly wilt.\n\nThe commandments of Metropolitan llarion are written for us. Not to fulfill his testaments means to be in great spiritual arrears before him.\n\nBesides the legacy which has already taken root in us in the form of some aspects of his ideology and learning (in the sphere of the Church, religious and national world-view, national learning and culture and so on), there is yet another legacy: Metropolitan Ilarion’s books and manuscripts. This legacy demands that we learn it. This would then constitute a great branch of our studies: a branch which we could call “Ohienkiana.”\n\nFirst of all, it would be necessary to list the titles of all his works, authored by him throughout some seventy years. (He actually first began to write as a fifteen-year-old boy in 1897). To collect, arrange and classify the titles of all of his works (more than a thousand) and to publish this as a “Bibliography of the Works of Metropolitan Ilarion” would be an important task. And it is of necessity that someone must soon complete this work so that we could show the world concrete published facts about the scholarly, reflective, literary and ecclesiastical works of Metropolitan llarion. For when he himself could write so many works for us, and publish a large majority of them with his own hard-earned finances, there would be no justification on our part if we were not able to compile and publish at least the titles of his works.\n\nThe works of Metropolitan Ilarion were often quoted by other authors and scholars (and sometimes used as the main resource material without giving the name of Metropolitan Ilarion, or his secular name, Professor I. Ohienko). To list the titles of the works of other authors in which Metropolitan Ilarion’s works were quoted means to create a “Bibliography of Bibliographies” in Ohienkiana. And this should also be done by someone.\n\nThere should be analytical monographies on some of his works. Most important, we must publish a monumental work on Metropolitan Ilarion—first of all a work of an academic nature, which should contain in detail every aspect of his work.\n\nTo study in a “scholarly” manner the life, work and creativity of Metropolitan Ilarion, that is, to do formal research, is not enough. We must recognize his stature and experience his creativity with our heart and soul. He did not act and create mechanically: it can be said, using his own style, that he “burned” with the fire of his own spirit. For this reason, future researchers, who will have only his works, and not knowing his living stature from autopsy, will not be able to reach the depths of their reality.\n\nThe spiritual legacy bequeathed by Metropolitan Ilarion is immense. But also great are our debts before him; great are our moral debts of obligation.\n\nA Memorial Not Made By Hands\n\nDuring the time of the Chirotony of Metropolitan Ilarion (1940) in the city of Kholm, the Ukrainian lands west of the rivers Buh and Syan, that is, the lands of Kholmshchyna, Pidlyashya, Zasyannya and Lemkiwshchyna, were in the borders of the “General-Government” (as the German authorities called Poland) under German occupation. The rest of the Ukrainian lands were occupied by Soviet armies. In proposing the candidacy of Prof. I. Ohienko for the Episcopate, the Ukrainians of the General-Government had no doubt that should the path to Kyiv be opened to him, he would have become Metropolitan of Kyiv, the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church with the Metropolitan Throne in Kyiv.\n\nIn 1941 the Germans led an assault on the U.S.S.R. from the General-Government and rapidly occupied all the Ukrainian lands together with Kyiv; but the boundary of the General-Government was not opened to Kyiv. The border lay on the rivers Buh and Syan, guarded by the Germans. The Ukrainian Orthodox population east of the Buh and Syan, in Polissya, Volyn’ and the Dnieper valley region, and especially in Kyiv, anticipated that Vladyka Ilarion (who in 1941 was honoured by the dignity of Metropolitan) would immediately come to Kyiv to the Metropolitan Throne as the most worthy successor of such primates as Metropolitan Ilarion of Kyiv (of the eleventh century) and Metropolitan Petro Mohyla. However, the German authorities forbade Metropolitan Ilarion to travel beyond the borders of the General-Government. He was especially forbidden to cross the border into the Ukrainian lands (including Kyiv) to the east of the river Buh, that is, the lands of Polissya, Volyn’ and the Dnieper valley region.\n\nProfessor Ivan Ohienko was well known to the entire Ukrainian people as a former Minister of the Ukrainian National Republic, as a great Ukrainian scholar, theologian and Church worker. Therefore, it is completely understandable that the Ukrainian Orthodox clergy, the intelligentsia and all the people could not imagine a more worthy candidate for the Metropolitan Throne in Kyiv than Professor Ivan Ohienko. However, the German authorities in principle forbade the filling of the (vacant) Kyivan Metropolitan Throne. Besides this, the German leaders were especially hostile to Vladyka Metropolitan Ilarion.\n\nFor the millions of Ukrainian Orthodox, this fact was something much worse than disappointment: this was a great blow because they all knew that the appearance of a candidate for the Metropolitan Throne of Kyiv such as Vladyka Ilarion is sometimes awaited for centuries.\n\nHowever, during the war years, millions of Ukrainian Orthodox continually turned, in their thoughts and feelings, to Danylo’s Hill in Kholm, where, as it was generally said, was kept “the prisoner of the Germans,” Vladyka Ilarion, whom the general mass of Ukrainian Orthodox considered their unofficial Primate.\n\nThe Ukrainian Greek-Orthodox Church of Canada was not only aware of the fact that Metropolitan Ilarion was a figure of pan-Ukrainian renown—more than this, a figure of world rank— but also considered the fact that he was a Man of an Age, for he was indeed a figure whose like is rarely found in the history of the Ukrainian people.\n\nAnd the very fact of this awareness, which in this case is common to all Ukrainians, constitutes our Spiritual Pantheon in which the Ukrainian people has placed his memorial not made by hands —its soul.\n\nMay his memory be eternal!"
