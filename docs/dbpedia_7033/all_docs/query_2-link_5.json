        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nJust to add to what the Administrator has said above, Constantinople became very suspicious of the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops (by \"Ruthenian\" here it is meant \"Ukrainian and Belarusyan\").\n\nConstantinople and Rome acted very much alike as patriarchal centres, to be sure. There was a \"pull\" factor toward western Europe because of the great influence of the Jesuits via the great universities, European civilization as a whole and the better position of Catholic bishops with respect to Rome.\n\nConstantinople actually tried to control the Ruthenian bishops to the point that it placed laymen, heads of the stauropeghial brotherhoods, OVER bishops - something that was entirely not to the Orthodox bishops' taste at all!\n\nToday, Orthodox anti-uniate polemics attack the subservience of EC bishops, but, in fact, it was precisely such subservience toward Constantinople that tended to push the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops in Rome's direction.\n\nI don't know what you've been reading in this connection, Ben, but I wouldn't mind having you outline what you believe are the dogmas that are entirely not in keeping with Orthodoxy at this historical juncture.\n\nIn fact, Orthodoxy at that time was heavily (and voluntarily) influenced by western Latin Catholicism.\n\nIn Greece, St Nicodemus the Hagiorite, for example, translated a number of western spiritual classics, including Loyolas' \"Spiritual Exercises\" although he gave the book a different title. He liked the book, even though he got into trouble once his confreres disccovered who the original author was. To this day, that book is read by even Athonite monks. The \"Imitation of Christ\" was also translated by him, as it was by St Peter Mohyla, Metropolitan of Kyiv. The \"Unseen Warfare\" was likewise translated by Nicodemus and it is the \"Spiritual Combat\" by Scupoli (also translated and read widely by Anglicans of the time). St Theophane the Recluse translated it into Russian with many more changes than Nicodemus had done.\n\nI say all this to indicate that the \"best of the West\" was appropriated by many circles within Orthodoxy at the time of the Unia. Later, Orthodox seminarians went to study in Paris and Rome and adopted even more Western devotions such as that to the Immaculate Conception of the BVM.\n\nSt Dmitri (Tuptalenko), Metropolitan of Rostov was particularly devotion to the IC, wore a medal of the IC that was popular among the Orthodox Brotherhoods of the Immaculate Conception in and around Kyiv at the time and, upon his repose, he asked to be buried in a Church dedicated to the \"Conception of St Anne.\"\n\nSt Peter Mohyla, the Wallachian Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych and Rus', insisted on teaching the existence of Purgatory and resisted the efforts of the Orthodox patriarchs gathered in Jassy to approve his \"Orthodox Catholic Catechism\" without it. He also emphasized the procession of the Holy Spirit \"through the Son\" as the \"Eastern way of understanding the western 'Filioque.'\"\n\nAs for the papacy, it cannot be reiterated too strongly that, at that time in history, the Ruthenian bishops sought union with Rome as a way to actually liberate themselves from the annoying dominance of Constantinople over them, together with the unseemly authority that the EP's lay reps exercised over them as well.\n\nAdd to this the fact that many Ruthenian bishops were quite enthusiastic about closer ties to Europe rather than with Constantinople under the Turks or with \"barbaric Muscovy\" at the time where, for example, neither education nor cultural refinement were that Church's strongpoints.\n\nAs for the later Latinizations that gripped the \"Orthodox in communion with Rome\" (for that is how the original EC's of Ruthenia called themselves - Russian Catholics to this day call themselves \"Russian Orthodox in communion with Rome\" or \"Russian Orthodox-Catholics\"), Orthodoxy itself was not immune to them.\n\nAnti-EC Orthodox polemics likes to say that this was \"imposed\" by Rome when, in fact, Rome had nothing to do with Latinization at all. The King of Poland had an interest in making his Orthodox subjects into Catholics, but when this caused real division, even the Poles rejected the Unia.\n\nAnti-EC Orthodox polemics, among many other myths that they spread, affirm that EC's had a privileged position under RC-controlled areas. And this is a complete fabrication since, for example, the EC Metropolitan followed RC episcopal processions in last place, even after the lowliest RC bishop!\n\nIn terms of faith differences, the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops at Brest saw a real agreement in terms of faith that was already achieved at the Council of Florence - but which was rejected by the radical Orthodox faction, at the council and in Greece and Russia. If there was any kind of wide disparity between Rome and Orthodoxy in terms of faith and practice, the Ruthenian Orthodox who came into union with Rome didn't see it.\n\nAgain, anti-EC Orthodox polemics wildly insists that the Catholic Church imposed this and that on the EC's, when, in fact, it was the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops, in the points of the Union of Brest itself, who asked that the Kingdom of Poland prevent Constantinople's \"policemen\" from entering and causing further disruptions to the life of their Church! If anything, this showed how anxious those Orthodox bishops were to move as far away from the EP's authoritarianism and from \"barbaric Muscovy's\" political influence as possible.\n\nThere is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops saw in the Union of Brest anything other than a practical renewal of the decrees of the Council of Florence and that of Lyons earlier (which were signed by St Peter (Akerovych) Metropolitan of Kyiv - an Orthodox Saint even though he never repudiated his personal communion with Rome stemming from Lyons). And they saw such a Union as bringing the benefits of European spiritual and cultural life to their Church and people within the same unified Church that existed before the East-West schism - and there was never any agreement as to when that finally occurred - there were Orthodox who argued that it NEVER occurred as far as the Church of Kyiv was concerned and that the Union of Brest was but a formal reaffirmation of such communion with Rome, especially as the Sixth Ecumenical Council had underlined earlier.\n\nAlex\n\nLast edited by Orthodox Catholic; 04:02 PM.\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Swan,\n\nSorry - I should have used \"Orthodox radical\" in the singular!\n\nFr. John Meyendorff (+memory eternal!) would have agreed with the Orthodox side at Florence, but he himself, in at least two places in his publications, took strong exception to St Mark of Ephesus' methodology which he felt was severely limited.\n\nAlso, we know today that the West developed the Filioque as part and parcel of its particular Triadology i.e. the inner Life of the Trinity (I forget the exact terminology, haven't reviewed it in a while).\n\nBut Meyendorff and others agreed that both sides could have come to an agreement on the procession of the Spirit \"Through the Son\" while Rome could have removed the Filioque unilaterally. That didn't happen and that really isn't germane to the topic here.\n\nThe Ruthenian Orthodox Bishops of the late sixteenth century who considered the Union of Florence as their real \"template\" of unity were content to leave the Latin Creed with its Filioque alone, as long as they didn't need to include it in the \"Greek version.\" Clearly, THEY believed there was no real conflict, especially since the majority of Greek bishops who had participated in the Florentine Council signed its decrees. And those decrees followed the same pattern - Rome can do as it wishes so long as it doesn't impose the Filioque and the purgatorial fire et alia on the East.\n\nAlso, there were Greek Orthodox hierarchs, like Bessarion, who had come to consider Eastern Orthodox theology as simply, for want of a better word, \"backward.\" They were in love with Renaissance Europe and the great strides in progress, education and culture it had made. They saw scholastic theology as superior to any other which is why they had no problem with the Filioque which, like the Latins, they came to see as \"logical\" based on reducing Triadology down to the inner relations of the Divine Persons etc. In other words, one could only \"identify\" the Persons in the Holy Trinity in these terms.\n\nThe Patristic tradition of the Cappadocian Fathers rejected that way of doing Trinitarian theology. But the disaffection with them and other aspects of Orthodoxy by both the Greeks at Lyons and Florence and the Ruthenians at Brest and later had not only political considerations (which, again, anti-EC Orthodox polemics emphasizes), but, more importantly, the cultural weltanschauung of the Greeks and Ruthenians who had become overwhelmingly attracted to a \"progressive Europe\" versus a \"backward East\" where Constantinople, under the Turkish Yoke, appeared paralyzed on all fronts to do anything for ecumenical Orthodoxy.\n\nEven St Gennadios Scholarios, who took over from St Mark of Ephesus the defence of the Orthodox Church (and was himself a towering intellect equal to anyone in Europe in his time), expressed a profound admiration for the scholastic method of St Thomas Aquinas (something St Mark of Ephesus would never have done).\n\nWhat is also fascinating about St Mark of Ephesus is that he not only opposed overtly Latin positions on Triadology and purgatory. He also opposed what he believed to have been the Latin reticence on the holy Conception of the Theotokos (something Aquinas denied). Both sides misunderstood each other on Original Sin - they only knew they disagreed with one another rather than moving to create a new synthesis on the subject. But the Immaculate Conception, which addresses primarily and only the issue of the Augustinian view on Original Sin as touching the Mother of God, was years before it was universally accepted within the RC Church.\n\nAs for papal jurisdiction - that was not the problem then that it is today, Greek suspicions notwithstanding. Even Eugenikos was willing to overlook those suspicions as long as the West accepted the historic Nicene Creed without the Filioque (his minimal requirement for church unity which he was in favour of).\n\nSt Mark of Ephesus spent the rest of his life defending his unwillingness to sign the Florentine unity decrees not only against Roman Catholic debaters, but also against those among the Greeks who truly did consider him to be a \"radical.\"\n\nAs he lay dying, his last will and testament included his wish that no Greek bishop/theologian who was in favour of the Florentine unity Council attend his funeral.\n\nAlex"
