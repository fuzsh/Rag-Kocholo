        "text": "Winnipeg, Manitoba, Saint Mary the Protectress Ukrainian Orthodox Sobor, 1923\n\nBukovina may be spelt Bukovyna, Bucovina.\n\nPrehistory\n\nUkrainian-speakers had begun to settle in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, since the late 19th century. In part, this was because Winnipeg was the main westward stopping point on the railways for immigrants who travelled from Eastern Canada. Some remained in Winnipeg, although most of them travelled farther to the west. According to the newspaper “Ukrainian Voice” :\n\nThe nucleus of Winnipeg’s Ukrainian community consisted of ten families from the village of Nebyliv, Kalush county, Galicia, who arrived in 1892-1893. After 1896, the city’s Ukrainian population, made up overwhelmingly of immigrants from Galicia and Bukovyna, grew steadily as some prospective homesteaders decided to stay in Winnipeg. It increased rapidly after 1905 when the boom in Canadian railway construction, mining, and lumbering attracted large numbers of Ukrainian labourers to the city’s railway yards and shops, factories, and road and sewer construction projects\n\nDuring the period of the turn of the 20th century in Winnipeg, there was a considerable amount of confusion with regard to the religious expression of the Ukrainian-, Russian-, Romanian-, Greek-, and Serbian-speaking Orthodox Christian immigrants ; but the main focus regarding this particular parish has to do with the early Ukrainian-speaking immigrants from the province of Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and their first descendants.\n\nThe greater number of persons from this region were, because of their particular history in this empire and in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and because of the 1596 Union of Brest, Ukrainian Greek Catholics (or “Uniats”). Many of their ancestors either willingly or unwillingly were taken into this union with Rome (the Roman Catholic Church). Those who came from the more Romanian-speaking province of Bukovina were usually Orthodox Christians, and they were generally fewer in number than those from Galicia. The region of Bukovina (or Bucovina) in Romanian Moldavia belonged in part to the same empire, but the Orthodox believers of that area were under the authority of the Serbian Orthodox Church at the time. The metropolitan's headquarters were in Chernivtsi (Cernăuţi), and he was the metropolitan bishop of that city.\n\nMany of the early newcomers to Canada arrived because of the successful advertising campaign in Ukraine by Josif Oleskiw. Although some of the newcomers to Canada were Orthodox Christians when they arrived, they were in a minority in Winnipeg. This was because of the number of people who arrived from Western Ukraine, where the great majority at that time were Ukrainian Catholics. Although some of them wished in their new freedom to return to the Orthodox Church, there was in the earliest times no organised Orthodox Christian community in Winnipeg.\n\nRoman Catholic or Orthodox Christian ?\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the determined organisation of immigrants began at first under the Roman Catholic Church, with the first missionaries to the Slavs, Priest Nestor Dmytriw, and Redemptorist Priest Achille Delaere (although neither worked principally in Winnipeg). The Ukrainian Greek Catholics were served within the Archdiocese of Saint Boniface under Archbishop Adélard Langevin. The clergy worked at keeping the Ukrainian Catholics together under Archbishop Adélard’s authority.\n\nWith the construction of the small Saint Nicholas church on McGregor Street in 1900, a focus was given to the immigrant community for the purpose of worship, but it remained vague as to whom they actually belonged. The Orthodox wished to have their own place of worship, but there was a dire shortage of clergy. Certain priests travelled north from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, in order to establish the Orthodox parishes of Saint Michael (1899) and Saint Demetrius (1900) (the “South Church”) in Gardenton (near Stuartburn and Tolstoi), and to meet the needs of Orthodox Christian believers elsewhere, and occasionally in Winnipeg.\n\nFinally, in 1902, through correspondence between Archbishop Langevin and Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of Lviv, the Basilian Order was able to release 3 priests to Canada, who soon settled in Alberta. They were followed by 2 Basilians, Father Matthew Hura and Father Naucratius Kryzanowsky, who settled in Winnipeg. However, it was not until 1904 that Father Matthew Hura was installed as the first permanent pastor.\n\nAlso in 1902, a member of the Manitoba Legislature, Joseph Bernier, introduced a bill in this legislature, which would convey the properties of the Greek Ruthenian Church (Ukrainians were also known as Ruthenians amongst Roman Catholics) in communion with Rome into the control of corporations under control of the Church of Rome. In conjunction with this, Archbishop Langevin declared that the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) must prove themselves to be Roman Catholics by turning property over to the church. However, many of the Ukrainians were unwilling to co-operate with the archbishop. Many of them knew that their families had long ago been Orthodox Christians, and that they had been subjugated to the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. Now that they were in Canada, they wished to take the opportunity to be free of the control of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nTo establish the Orthodox Christian Church anywhere in Canada was not particularly easy or simple, but in Winnipeg it was more complicated than average.\n\nThere were missionary efforts by various clergy from Minneapolis, Minnesota (735 km/457 mi to the south) in Southern Manitoba by the beginning of the 20th century. This was aided by railway service which had already been established between Winnipeg and Minneapolis by 1890. Many of these efforts included reaching out to the Ukrainian Orthodox, in the manner led by Archpriest Alexis Toth. By 1904, their labours in Winnipeg became visible when the Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity on the corner of Manitoba Avenue and McKenzie Street was constructed, and then sanctified by Bishop Tikhon (Belavin). However, this Temple was not large. Moreover, although most of the priests who served this parish could speak Ukrainian and they were usually from the territory of Ukraine, the services were offered in the Church Slavonic language, and they continued to be so.\n\nAlthough this was satisfactory to the parishioners who came from Kyiv and other more easterly and southerly parts of Ukraine, this was ultimately not satisfactory to those who had begun to desire and to demand the Ukrainian language in Divine Services.\n\nSaint Nicholas Temple constructed\n\nIn the very same year, the Basilian Fathers (a semi-monastic order) of the Roman Catholic Church constructed a new and larger Saint Nicholas Church at 612, Flora Avenue, opposite the old building (which became a reading hall and Ukrainian Heritage School). Other attempts to expand were unsuccessful, and it was in 1966 that this parish moved to Bannerman Avenue.\n\nSoon, however, tensions began to emerge between the Basilians and some of the parishioners who had established and built the small church. The dissident parishioners were suspicious of the austere Basilian priest-monks. This was not only because they were under the authority of Archbishop Langevin and they accepted financial aid from the Roman Catholic primate, but also because the Basilians opposed everything that suggested secularism and liberalism. What the dissidents yearned for was secular, married Ukrainian Catholic nonmonastic clergy (or for some, Orthodox parish priests), like the ones they had known in the old country. The Ukrainian Catholics also yearned for the immediate appointment of a Ukrainian Catholic bishop, who, they believed, would guarantee the autonomy and survival of their church in Canada. Tensions continued.\n\nConfusing alternatives\n\n“Metropolitan Seraphim”\n\nTo add to this tension and confusion, there appeared in Winnipeg in 1903, the imposter-bishop Stefan Ustvolsky, who called himself “Metropolitan Seraphim”. Presenting himself under forged documents as a Russian Orthodox bishop, he gathered a large following, and he spread illicitly ordained clergy across the prairies. He was assisted by the monk Makarii Marchenko. The “bishop” also built a makeshift “cathedral” which became nicknamed the “Tin Can Cathedral”. It was situated at the corner of King Street and Stella Avenue. Much later, a play was written about this. Another of his buildings, the Holy Ghost Church, was built beside the Our Saviour Ukrainian Independent Church (but in a more regular style) at McGregor Street and Pritchard Avenue. In fact, the Orthodox and the Ukrainian Catholics alike suffered from itinerant immigrant clergy who sometimes appeared from abroad without blessing or permission from their bishops to emigrate, and without blessing or permission from any Canadian ecclesiastical authority to be in Canada.\n\n“Metropolitan” Seraphim ordained about 50 priests and numerous deacons (many of whom were semi-illiterate), who exercised priestly duties throughout the settlements. Of course, their sacramental activities could not be recognised or accepted by canonical Orthodox clergy or bishops. “Metropolitan” Seraphim was active from 1903 until 1908, after which he yielded to the exhortations of Archimandrite Arseny (Chahovtsov) (of the “Russian Mission”), and he departed to Russia. It was a long time before the remnants of his activity could be absorbed into one or another entity on the prairies.\n\nIndependent Greek Orthodox Church\n\nThere was yet another complicating factor which made the early establishment of the Orthodox Church in Canada (and Winnipeg in particular) convoluted. This was the introduction of the Independent Greek Orthodox Church. This entity had been organised in 1903-1904 by Cyril Genik, a very popular person, in association with the Presbyterian Church in Winnipeg. This entity introduced many congregations across the prairies which appeared to be Orthodox both in their worship and in their buildings, but which were, in fact, Protestant communities.\n\nIn Winnipeg, this entity, the Seraphimite entity and others also began to use both Manitoba College (the Presbyterian college) and Wesley College (the Methodist college) to try to provide some theological education for their candidates for ordination. A Presbyterian or Methodist influence on the students was inevitable.\n\nSaints Vladimir and Olga Ukrainian Catholic Church, 1907\n\nThen, in September, 1907, the Ukrainian Catholic parish of Saints Vladimir and Olga was established at 115, McGregor Street. This was achieved through the help of Father Mykola Strutynsky, a Ukrainian-American secular (that is, not belonging to a monastic order) Ukrainian Catholic priest who was visiting Winnipeg.\n\nThe incorporation of the building and property was through a parish committee, and the parish would not recognise the authority of the Roman Catholic archbishop. This decision brought with it difficulties in finding a priest to serve the community. In April, 1908, the committee brought Father Toma Vasylevych (from Terebovlia county, eastern Galicia) to the city as an immigrant. They used funds provided by the “Ukrainian Mutual Benefit Association of Saint Nicholas”.\n\nHowever, they did not have the blessing or permission of the bishop in Lviv or the bishop in Saint Boniface to do this. He had come from the same town as the future Father Peter Sametz of the future Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church. After Father Vasylevych’s departure some 6 months later, he was succeeded by Father Alexander Humecky (Humetsky), another itinerant priest who had come to Canada without the hierarchy’s permission. He helped by overseeing the construction of a priest’s residence and a parish hall, before he abandoned the parish and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, and he moved to the Russian Orthodox Church. It was only when the elderly Father Emyliian Krasicky (Krasitsky) arrived in 1910 that some stability came. It was 2 years later that a Ukrainian Catholic bishop came on the scene (Bishop Nykyta Budka).\n\n“Ukrainian Voice” (“Ukrainskyi Holos”), 1910\n\nFrom the time of the first edition of the “Ukrainian Voice” (“Ukrainskyi Holos”) newspaper was published on 16 March, 1910, this newspaper was a fixture of Ukrainian Canadian households across Canada. The “Ukrainian Voice” was initially established as a vehicle for enlightenment. It was also intended to enable this enlightenment to spread into school districts where there were no Ukrainian teachers. The paper was fully dedicated to the interests of Ukrainian settlers. The decision to publish such a paper was made at the Ukrainian teachers’ convention in 1908. The publishing company, founded on shares sold only to Ukrainians, was founded in 1909. The first edition of the “Ukrainian Voice” was printed in 1910. The newspaper was published for more than a century, until its last issue in 2018.\n\nThe paper became a mechanism for helping to organise the Ukrainian community, and in particular the Ukrainian Orthodox community. It also informed its readership about political, social, religious and other matters. It also helped to reawaken the national consciousness of the Ukrainian Canadian community, and it provided leadership and encouragement for them to participate fully in Canadian politics and to take full advantage of the educational opportunities. The influence of this newspaper was clearly underlined in the biography of the Mitred Archpriest Peter Sametz.\n\nFormation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, 1918\n\nThe 1917 overthrow of the Russian Empire and the subsequent Bolshevik Revolution caused political and ecclesiastical upheaval, both on the former empire’s territory, and abroad. All the missionary projects of the Russian Orthodox Church outside that territory were cut adrift from their “parental” supports. This, and the increasing rise in nationalistic sentiment, provided an opportunity in Canada as well. Dissident Ukrainian Catholic laymen, who had been nurtured on the democratic and populist ideals of Ukrainian Radicalism and National Democracy, established the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada at a convention in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in July, 1918.\n\nThe movement towards this was led by young professionals, particularly teachers (amongst them was the young Peter Sametz) and small-business owners, who resented the domination and control of Catholic clergy, and who were convinced that foreign-dominated Roman Catholic, Russian Orthodox and Protestant churches were inimical to the interests of Ukrainians. The movement has been described as being very assertive, and nationalistic in character. The Church’s founders wanted a national (“narodna”) church free of foreign control and governed democratically by the local laity and the clergy. They decided that the new church would enter into communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches ; accept their dogma and rites ; elect bishops at a general council (“sobor”) of clergy and lay delegates ; ordain married men into the priesthood ; and allow the congregations to control their own property and to participate in the appointment and dismissal of pastors.\n\nIn 1919, they were able to find a temporary bishop in the person of Metropolitan Germanos (Shehadi) (sometimes spelt Shegedi), of New York City, USA. Although he was supposedly the American Exarch of the Antiochian (Syrian) Orthodox Church, there were difficulties between him and the patriarchate. Nevertheless, he gave pastoral service and protection to the nascent church until 1924. The day-to-day administration of the church was left in the hands of an elected consistory of 2 priests and 3 laymen.\n\nWinnipeg environment\n\nAll this being the case, Winnipeg nevertheless lacked a Ukrainian Orthodox parish during the early 1920s, and there was no parish which used the Ukrainian language in worship services. This was despite the formation of the “independent” and “Bukovynian” Saint Michael’s Church in Point Douglas in 1918.\n\nWinnipeg was the home of some of the Church’s most prominent founders — teacher Wasyl Swystun, lawyer Jaroslaw W Arsenych, and politician Taras D Ferley. It was also already the seat of the Church’s consistory and its young administrator, Priest Semen Sawchuk. However, it is an irony that the actual organisation of a Ukrainian Greek Orthodox congregation waited until the fall of 1923. Contributing to this anomaly is the fact that by 1918, Winnipeg’s Ukrainians had available to them a possible choice of 2 large Ukrainian Catholic parishes, 1 Russian Orthodox, 1 independent (Bukovynian) Orthodox Christian congregation, and a Ukrainian Presbyterian congregation.\n\nThe environment was confusing, since few people had an understanding of eccclesiology and few understood clearly the difference between the Orthodox Christian Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church.\n\nForming the parish, 1923\n\nWhen efforts to establish a Ukrainian Greek Orthodox congregation around the independent Saint Michael Bukovynian Orthodox Church in Point Douglas (on Disraeli Street) failed, there was no alternative but to establish a new congregation. That parish did not then perceive that it was Ukrainian, but it had certainly developed in reaction to the personality of Bishop Adam (Philipowsky). After the arrival in Winnipeg of Wasyl Swystun and Julian Stechishyn (a Saskatoon lawyer), the pair started organising people who expressed an interest in forming a Ukrainian Orthodox parish. They were joined by Wasyl Kudryk (the first editor of “Ukrainian Voice”, a long-time teacher, a former independent Greek church deacon), who later became an Orthodox priest.\n\nIn July, 1923, a small group of concerned and interested individuals met for the first time at the Ukrainian National Home to discuss the situation and to explore the idea of starting a Ukrainian Orthodox parish. The foundation was laid by this group who included :\n\nPriest Wasyl Kudryk ; Stefan Basisty ; Hryhoriy Block ; Joseph Bohonos ; Taras Ferley ; Apolinarij Novak ; Julian Stechyshyn ; Myroslav Stechyshyn ; Wasyl Swystun.\n\nStefan Basisty was elected to be the acting chairman. After 3 meetings, the committee expanded from approximately 12 to 30 people. It included :\n\nPriest S W Sawchuk ; Victor Kupchenko ; Paul Popiel ; Manoly Mihaychuk ; Michael Skyba.\n\nNot all those who attended the initial meetings became members of the parish.\n\nThen a parish committee was organised and in addition to the above members, others joined, including :\n\nWasyl Batycki ; Dmytro Danko ; Wasyl Kiziuk ; M Komar ; Semen Kowbel ; Wasyl Novak.\n\nA new parish was thus formed, and it was decided to rent space for services at Saint Peter’s Anglican Church on Selkirk Avenue and Aikins Street, and to explore the possibility of purchasing the structure.\n\nIt was in this same year, 1923, that Saint John’s Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, was organised.\n\nSemen W Sawchuk was invited to be the congregation’s first pastor. He was also at that time the acting head of the UGOCC. Temporary arrangements were made with Saint Peter’s Anglican Church, at the corner of Selkirk Avenue and Aikins Street, to hold Sunday services there. Thus, on 7 January, 1924 (the Feast of the Nativity of Christ according to the Julian calendar), the first Ukrainian Greek Orthodox, Ukrainian-language liturgy was celebrated in Winnipeg. Wasyl Swystun, one of the most prominent founders of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in 1918, directed the choir. His popularity and activity sometimes caused the whole UGOCC to be identified with him to such an extent that the church was labelled “the Swystunites”.\n\nFor a time, services were held on alternate Sundays following the Anglican services ; however, it soon became obvious that the structure was not suitable for the new parish, and a new search was started. The executive, under the presidency of Wasyl Novak, commenced a search for a parcel of land to build their own new church.\n\nPurchase of land ; beginning construction of the Temple, 1924\n\nIt was envisioned immediately for the future, to construct a large Temple, which would serve as a cathedral. As a result, in May, 1924, undeveloped land consisting of 10 lots was purchased where Burrows and Magnus Avenues intersect with Sinclair Street. The cost was $2,600. The cathedral was to be built in 2 stages, the first stage being the basement so that services could be offered sooner.\n\nThe upper level would be built at a later date when funds would be available. A national fundraising campaign was initiated with announcements in numerous Ukrainian language newspapers. Donations were received from all parts of Canada from individuals sending in $1.00, $2.00, $5.00 and even less. Collections were held at various functions across the west of Canada, at which people contributed to the building of the new Cathedral. Initial members and supporters of the parish extended all across Canada. Construction started in June, 1925, and by late November, 1925, the first part, the basement, had been completed.\n\nCornerstone (northwest corner)\n\nThe parish was officially chartered on 12 October, 1925, under the Manitoba Church Lands Act. The first trustees of the parish were :\n\nHryhoriy Block ; Joseph Bohonos ; Victor Kupchenko ; Wasyl Novak ; Wasyl Swystun.\n\nThus, the first Ukrainian Orthodox parish in Winnipeg was fully organised and established.\n\nThe chosen design of the cathedral had been prepared by Semen Kowbel, and based on the style of the Saint Mykolaivska Sobor in Kyiv, Ukraine. Mr Kowbel was a master builder, an amateur stage director and playwright, and it was he who supervised the construction.\n\nMembers of the parish volunteered thousands of hours of physical labour in order to hand-dig the basement and to pour and build the stone and concrete walls and floor. As the men were digging, the women and youth helped with many chores by providing food, refreshments, and helping in any way they could. In addition to the volunteer time, funds of $39,000.00 were required to pay for the construction and the furnishing of the structure. Members generously donated funds, leaving only $15,000.00 which had to be provided by private loans and a mortgage. The building committee, under the direction of Semen Kowbel, coordinated the construction of the structure. The initial president during the 1925 construction was Paul Popeil, and Wasyl Swystun served as president from the latter part of 1925 up to 1928.\n\nArchpastoral visit, 1925\n\nOn 16 August, 1925, Archbishop John (Theodorovych), who was in Winnipeg for his annual visitation, blessed the cornerstone and then celebrated the liturgy assisted by 4 priests while the choir, conducted by Wasyl Swystun, sang liturgical pieces arranged by Bortniansky, Koshetz and Stetsenko.\n\nArchbishop John (Theodorovych) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1924\n\nIn January, 1926, the first marriage which was blessed in the new Temple was of 2 public school teachers. This fact demonstrates the congregation’s upwardly mobile, lower-middle-class membership.\n\nVarious parish activities\n\nParish activities greatly flourished while attention was focussed on paying off the loans. The membership was expanded from a small number to hundreds of families. Prior to the building of the Temple, a choir was organised and directed by Wasyl Swystun. Olha Swystun headed the first ladies’ organisation in the parish. Anna (Hanka) Romanchych coordinated the first Sunday School, and Michael Demchuk headed the first Brotherhood. The “Boyan Theatrical Choir” under the direction of Maxym Pasichniak also flourished in the parish. This fact illustrates well the origin of many of the early parishioners. Boyan (also spelt Boian) is a village to the east of the city of Chernivtsi in the province of Bukovina. It is a village of mostly Romanian-speakers, and some Ukrainian-speakers, to this day.\n\nAlthough the parish had a Sunday school, attended by about 150 children in 1926, the Cathedral of Saint Mary the Protectress did not offer many devotional activities. However, the parish soon became the hub of many cultural and educational activities. A substantial number of congregation members had belonged to the Maria Zankovetska Educational and Dramatic Society, and to the Boyan Society during the active period of the society a decade earlier.\n\nBy the winter of 1925-1926, the Ukrainian National Home Choral and Dramatic Society was staging popular plays and operettas such as Mykhailo Starytsky’s “Chornomortsi” (“The Black Sea Cossacks”) and “Oi ne khody Hrytsiu” (“Don’t Go to Parties, Hryts”) in the parish’s basement hall, in order to raise funds for further construction. Concerts commemorating Ukrainian cultural and political figures and major historical events, lectures on topics ranging from popular science to Ukrainian poetry, and debates, including the first inter-provincial student debates, were also held on Sunday afternoons and evenings.\n\nIn particular, congregation leaders had a strong commitment to preserving the memory of the “Ukrainian People’s Republic (“Ukrainska narodna respublyka”) that had existed briefly from 1918 to 1920.\n\n1926 visit of Archbishop John (Theodorovych)\n\nWhen Alexander Koshetz and the internationally acclaimed Ukrainian National Chorus performed at Winnipeg’s Walker Theatre for the second time in November 1926, the chorus members attended Sunday services at the cathedral, and the renowned “basso profundo” (contrabass singer), Hlib Shandrovsky (Glib Chandrowsky), sang the Nicene Creed (“Viruiu”).\n\nIn order to endow cultural-educational work with direction and continuity, in October, 1927, the congregation (re-)established the Boyan Society ; and Maksym Pasichniak, the first Boyan Society’s musical director, resumed his duties. Members included veterans of older choral and dramatic societies, and young people drawn from the Sunday school classes. The society maintained a library, and it held choir practices once a week, every week of the year. Sunday afternoon lectures and choral concerts were also a weekly event during the fall and winter season, and 5 or 6 plays were staged annually. By 1929, no Ukrainian parish or congregation in the city could rival this cathedral parish insofar as cultural activities were concerned.\n\n1930s\n\nBecause of the Great Depression in the 1930s, funds became very limited as many of the parishioners lost their jobs. During these difficult years, and under the leadership of 8 different presidents, the parish continued to flourish and expand its activities and membership, despite the lack of funds. However, this period did not allow for further construction.\n\nPriest Semen W Sawchuk served as the parish priest from its inception until 1932 (except for one year), when Priest Peter Mayevsky arrived. He then served the parish from 1932 until 1946. At this time, membership expanded to number more than 500 families.\n\nA serious internal conflict broke out during 1935-1940, between the consistory and a group led by Swystun, which was focussed on the church’s designated cathedral parish, Saint Mary the Protectress. The group questioned the leadership of Archbishop John (Theodorovych), and his desire for a closer relationship with other Orthodox Churches. As a result, the parish seceded for a time.\n\n1940s\n\nIn the early 1940s, the mortgage was paid off, and a mortgage retirement ceremony was celebrated. In 1944, it was decided to start fundraising for the completion of the upper level. By 1946, approximately $20,000.00 had been raised, but this was not sufficient to begin construction.\n\nIn 1947, on the initiative of the executive headed by Hryhoriy Block as president, Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) arrived in Winnipeg from Poland, in order to serve in this parish. He was joined 1 year later, in 1948, by Priest Hryhorij Metiuk.\n\nThe arrival of the metropolitan and the future metropolitan was a part of the arrival from Europe and elsewhere of a large number of displaced Ukrainians following World War II. The majority of them settled in Eastern Canada, but some travelled to the west.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) Theophany blessing\n\nIn the same year, the first officially resident bishop to head the UGOCC was elected to be the Archbishop of Winnipeg. This was Bishop Mystyslav (Skrypnyk), who arrived from Germany. However, after only 2 years of service in Canada, and because of differences with the UGOCC administration, he departed for New York, USA.\n\n1950s\n\nDue to very generous donations by parishioners, member organisations and the timely contribution from the large estate of Michael Korzyk, sufficient funds became available, and the executive felt that construction of the upper level should begin. In 1950, an additional appeal was made for funds.\n\nIn 1951, the executive initiated the construction. It was under the direction of Nicholas Kushniryk. The building committee was headed by Nicholas Hawryluk, who was assisted by Walter Gelmych.\n\nArchbishop Ilarion (Ohienko), 1951\n\nIn 1951, Archbishop Ilarion (Ohienko) became the primate of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, and its first metropolitan. At a later date, Father Metiuk also would become the primate of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as Metropolitan Andriy (Metiuk). The parishioners understand that they were blessed to have been the source of 2 metropolitans of the UGOCC, the only parish in Canada to claim such an honour.\n\nThe construction of the upper level was completed, and the cathedral was blessed on 28 December, 1952. In addition to the many thousands of hours of volunteer labour time donated, the cost of the upper level was almost $165,000.00. The architect for the upper level was Stephan Muensh. At the beginning of the construction work, Metropolitan Ilarion was still in this parish. Father H Metiuk continued to lead the parish until 1958, when he became a bishop of the UGOCC.\n\n1960s\n\nAfter the completion of the upper cathedral structure, inside furnishings and the relocation of the iconostas from the lower hall, attention was focussed on completing the interior of the upper part. Painting and decorating of the walls and ceiling, and building a new iconostas was deemed to be a priority. The parish executive, under the direction of Hrehory Babiak, began additional fundraising, with strong support from parishioners and member organisations.\n\nChange from \"cathedral\" to \"sobor\"\n\nWhen the cathedral seat of the metropolitan was moved from Saint Mary's to the Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral, this parish continued to be called a “sobor”. This was so not only because it is a large Temple which can accommodate many people, but also because it had previously been the cathedral parish and the seat of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the UOGCC.\n\nNave, interior (left) ; Iconostas, tetrapod (right)\n\nHigh Place in the Altar (left) ; Central chandelier (right)\n\nBaptismal font (left) ; Westward view\n\nPanorama from the choir loft\n\nPriest I Stus was the dean of the parish during this period. The iconostas and the wall-icons were prepared by the artist G S Hordynsky, who was assisted by Roman Kowal. They were completed at a cost of approx. $44,000.00, and they were blessed on 16 October, 1965. During the following years, due to the generosity of many donors and the member organisations, the cathedral was completely finished under the executive leaderships of Jakym Gelmych and later Dmytro Duschak, with Priest Serhij Kiciuk as the dean.\n\nHoly Table\n\nHigh Place\n\nSaints John and Basil\n\n1970s\n\nThe sobor parish celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1975 during the tenure of Priest Andrew Teterenko.\n\n1980s\n\nBy the early 1980s, it became obvious that some renovations were required. The domes outside had to be repainted and the cathedral windows had to be replaced due to deterioration.\n\nIn 1982, the executive under the leadership of John Kapty, embarked on the project. Alex Surasky raised much of the $55,000.00 from the bingo activities of Saint Andrew’s Brotherhood, and he co-ordinated the design and installation of the new dual-pane windows.\n\nAlthough minor repairs to the basement auditorium had been done in the 1970s, it was obvious that major renovations were required to modernise the basement auditorium. There, everything had to be renovated and modernised, such as : a new boiler with a new heating system, the electrical supply, the ceiling, the floor, and other improvements. The total project cost was about $110,000.00, and the parish embarked on the renovation in 1986. The project was co-ordinated by Alex Surasky who also did most of the fundraising and construction co-ordination under the executive of which Mary Kushniryk was president. The parish dean at this time was Priest Stephen Semotiuk, who served in the parish from 1983 to 1992.\n\nThe last remaining major work was the restoration and cleaning of the inside of the cathedral, and the replacement of the roof. At a cost of almost $85,000.00, the restoration was completed in 1987. The fundraising and project co-ordination were carried out by Alex Surasky from the executive under the presidency of William Kowalchuk.\n\nExpansion of the property ; Ukrainian Millennium Villa, 1989\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the bingo committee under the presidency of Michael Chaykowski, embarked on a programme of acquiring land for future development adjacent to the cathedral. As homes came on the market, they were purchased by the parish for future expansion. Construction started in 1988 on a 72-unit seniors’ housing complex at a cost of $4,200,000.00. The Ukrainian Orthodox Millennium Villa was completed in the summer of 1989. A non-profit corporation was established, to which the parishioners elected 9 board members. Dmytro Duschak was elected by the board to serve as the chairman for more than 10 years after the Villa’s inception. The parish provided a portion of the funds necessary, and the Board of Directors obtained a long-term mortgage for the balance. They have successfully managed the property by maintaining a near zero vacancy, and by paying down a large portion of the mortgage. The church executive, under the direction of William Kowalchuk, supported and encouraged fundraising and member involvement. The project design and construction was co-ordinated by the Board of Directors.\n\n'\n\nViews of Millennium Villa\n\nSaint Mary Protectress from the Millennium Villa\n\nRe-naming of the UGOCC, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada was officially renamed “The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada” (UOCC) by an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe UOCC entered into Eucharistic union with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, 1990\n\nIn 1990, the 18th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba, decided to enter into Eucharistic Union with the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (Istanbul). This decision also changed the relationship with the other Orthodox dioceses and parishes in Canada in a positive way.\n\n1990s\n\nIn 1990, the centennial of Ukrainian settlement in Canada was marked.\n\nA second major project, in 1995, was the construction of a large 3-level elevator inside the Temple, in order to allow the elderly and the infirm easier access into the cathedral. At a total project cost of $175,000.00, the fund-raising campaign was successful in raising the full amount required due to the generous support of our parishioners, supporters and member organisations. Vasyl Balan, president, guided the executive and the project was coordinated by Dmytro Dushchak.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, under the direction of James Chimuk, this parish was one of the first to computerise the parish’s financial and accounting records. This work continued and expanded.\n\n2000s ; 75 years\n\nThe parish celebrated its 75th anniversary in the year 2000. In preparation for this event, the executive, under the direction of Eugene Hyworon, president, embarked on several major renovation projects and celebration events for this anniversary. Major renovations included modernising the men’s lavatories ; repainting the outside structure trim and domes ; repairing and venting the roof ; cleaning and restoring the inside walls and ceilings of the cathedral ; lighting the domes ; improving the roadway and sidewalks in front of the cathedral, and other works.\n\nThe events for the celebration included a Spring Ball ; a Summer Reunion Festival ; a Fall Patron Feast Day ; and the commissioning of a plaque by Leo Mol commemorating Metropolitan Ilarion and others. Included also was the support for and the fundraising for the publication of a book authored by Prof. Mykola Timoshyk about Metropolitan Ilarion’s life and work. The project of researching and consolidating all historical information and artifacts about the parish began. In addition, there was preparation for establishing a computerised data-base of all information as well as preparing all historical artifacts and photos for a permanent exhibition. All the materials were also stored on computer CDs for future research, use, and publications about the parish. The parish dean at that time was the Archpriest Michael Skrumeda.\n\nAlthough the information provided above is only a brief summary of highlights and mentions only a few names, the growth and development of the parish includes many hundreds of devoted persons who have made this parish strong and lively over the years. The parish is blessed with many persons and member organisations that, through the years, have continued to work diligently and to donate generously. No one person nor any particular generation is responsible for what this parish has accomplished. It has been a continuous and ongoing building process.\n\nPoster\n\n75 years\n\nThe year 2000 commemorated the 75th anniversary of the parish. It observed the date of the formal incorporation of the parish, although the actual organisation had occurred 2 years previously. From the founders of the 1920s, the pioneers of the 1930s and the subsequent builders of the 1940s to the 1990s, the parishioners have continued to make this parish grow, develop and flourish.\n\nGratitude was extended by the president of the parish in 2000 to the previous executives and parish deans of 1927, 1952, 1965 and 1985, who ensured that qualified persons or committees documented major events in the parish over the years, and who published 3 souvenir booklets about specific events or celebrations as well as a book about the first 60 years of the parish’s history.\n\nCentennial of the UOCC, 2018\n\nIn 2018, the 100th anniversary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and also of Holy Trinity Cathedral were marked at an extraordinary sobor (assembly) at the cathedral in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe purpose of the sobor was to celebrate 100 years of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. The celebrations were attended by Ukrainian Orthodox faithful from across Canada and beyond.\n\nThe Sobor began on Thursday, 9 August, 2018, with a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in the Chapel of Saint Petro Mohyla Institute, presided by Bishop Andriy (Peshko) of the Eastern Eparchy, with the responses sung by the Clergy led by Father Michael Lomaszkiewicz. This was followed by an All-Canada Clergy Conference.\n\nCentennial Clergy Conference\n\nAll gathered for Vespers at the Mohyla Institute Chapel and this was followed by a wine and cheese reception as the delegates and guests registered for the Extraordinary National Council.\n\nThe celebrations continued for a year.\n\n2020-2021 Coronavirus-19 virus restrictions on parishes\n\nIn early 2020, the Covid-19 virus made its appearance in Canada, and it quickly became a world-wide pandemic. Because of the rules governing gatherings that were laid down by the provincial and city governments, the parish stopped any further services after 8 March, 2020. Including the rules regarding social distancing, the decreasing numbers permitted for any gathering, and the considerations regarding the health of all concerned, this and other parishes were required to close for a time.\n\nAs elsewhere, there was some controversy about the legal requirements.\n\nElection of Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk), 2022\n\nElection of a nominee by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\n\nOn 15-19 June, 2022, the 24th Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox of Canada was convened \"on-line\". This conference-meeting was convened thus instead of convening physically (as customarily) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. There were 6 cathedrals in Canada where this meeting took place simultaneously through a computer-network : in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral) ; Vancouver, British Columbia (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Edmonton, Alberta (Saint John's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral) ; in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (Holy Trinity Cathedral) ; in Toronto, Ontario (Saints Vladimir and Olga Cathedral) ; in Montréal, Québec (Saint Sophie Cathedral).\n\nThere was a total of 205 delegates, which was near the average attendance for such sobors.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Sobor, there was the necessary election in order to nominate to the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople a candidate for election as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, who would succeed the Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk).\n\nThere were 3 candidates who were considered : Archbishop Job (Getcha), Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk), and Bishop Andriy (Peshko). The final choice of the members of the sobor was Archbishop Job (Getcha). He had received more than the minimum required 51% of the votes, and there was no subsequent voting required.\n\nThe election by the Sobor (Assembly) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada then had to be confirmed by the Holy Synod of Bishops of Constantinople (as is described in the Consistory By-laws).\n\nUpon having received the nomination (with accompanying documents) from the Sobor of the UOCC, the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) to become Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople elected Archbishop Job (Getcha) to become Metropolitan of Pisidia, in west-central Türkiye (Turkey), north of Lycia, and east of Ephesus.\n\nConfirmation of election in Constantinople/Istanbul, 2022\n\nOn 29 August, 2022, Vladyka Ilarion (Rudnyk) was at the Phanar in Constantinople for the purpose of the first confirmation of the election in June, 2022. He co-served the Divine Liturgy with Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) in the Cathedral of Saint George at the Phanar.\n\nEnthronement as Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, 2022\n\nOn Saturday, 19 November, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., in Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Enthronement Hierarchical Divine Liturgy was served. Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) presided at the Divine Liturgy. He was assisted by Bishop Andriy (Peshko), many priests, several deacons, subdeacons and Altar-servers. Present also were Metropolitan Archbishop Sotirios (Athanassoulas), Exarch of Canada for the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk), Former Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nMetropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) at the Phanar, Istanbul, 2023\n\nOn Sunday, 2 July, 2023, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (Archontonis) was present and praying during the Divine Liturgy at Saint George's Cathedral in the Patriarchate compound. He gave the blessing that Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk) preside (\"horostasia\") over the Divine Liturgy. Metropolitan Job (Getcha) of Pisidia, Bishop Athenagoras (Ziliaskopoulos) of Nazianzos, and the Honourable Roman Nedilskyi, General Consul of Ukraine in Constantinople were also present and praying with the congregation of the Faithful.\n\nChange of calendar for the UOCC, 2023\n\nOn 1 December, 2023, in accordance with the resolutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, Metropolitan Ilarion II (Rudnyk) announced that, effective that day, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada moved to use the New (Revised Julian) Calendar. He allowed that for a brief period of time, a parish might remain on the Old (Julian) Calendar.\n\nIt seems that subsequently, John's Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, was the first to adopt the New (Revised Julian) Calendar.\n\nHowever, a previously-existing group of persons began to encourage resistance to the immediacy of this change. It was their understanding that the process would be determined ultimately and finally at the next general sobor of the UOCC. Therefore, on 16 December, 2023, Metropolitan Ilarion issued a formal letter concerning the situation, together with a letter of support sent to him by his predecessor (Retired Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk)). He called the resisters to repentance.\n\nParish organisations\n\nParish organisations include : the cathedral choir ; the \"Bratchyky\" ; the sisterhood ; Saint Mary’s Brotherhood ; The Ukrainian Women’s Association (Kniahynia Olha Branch) ; the Saint Andrew’s Brotherhood ; the CYMK ; the \"Boyan\" ; the Sunday school ; the Millennium Villa.\n\nPriests who served in this parish include : Priest Semen W Sawchuk 1923-1932 (except for one year) Priest Peter Mayevsky 1932-1946 Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) 1947-1962 Priest Hryhorij Metiuk 1948-1958 Priest I Stus Priest Andrew Teterenko Priest Stephen Semotiuk 1983-1992 Archpriest Michael Skrumeda Priest Alexander Harkavyj\n\nSaint Mary the Protectress from the south, autumn\n\nParticular parish information\n\nThis sobor is a parish of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, the Central Eparchy, in the Winnipeg Region.
