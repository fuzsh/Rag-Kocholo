We have one in our church that is pretty western. To describe it, St Peter's in Roma is in the left backround and then one of those Byzantine icon rock cliffs( where did that come from?? )on the right hand side. The heirarchs are in the front along with Klement Sheptytsky. Charentsky is in the middle. It says in ukie Blessed Martyrs on the bottom them the date of the pope's visit. Dyakuyu.\n\n-ukrainiancatholic\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,402\n\nLikes: 33\n\nDear Daniil,\n\nAgreed, but I'm not talking just about the Eastern/Western issue, but the Ukrainian cultural/national issue as well.\n\nI think only a Ukrainian can produce a service to these saints that would be acceptable in our traditional Ukrainian parishes with some mention of love of country, Ukrainian tradition etc.\n\nOnly someone who is a member of our \"in-group\" can do this best.\n\nThe Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan, Ilarion Ohienko, a scholar in his own Rite , reviewed many Orthodox services to Ukrainian saints and actually banned several from being served since they were \"not of a Ukrainian spirit\" (but of a Russian one).\n\nThis is an important issue for our people and it is only appropriate that it be acknowledged in any future services to our saints.\n\nThe veneration of the Pratulyn Martyrs has yet to make itself felt and this is mainly because of the fact that these have been taken over by the Polish Church.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,402\n\nLikes: 33\n\nDear Daniil,\n\nI couldn't agree more!\n\nSt Peter Mohyla wasn't Ukrainian, as we know, and who can match him in the Kyivan Church?\n\nMany \"Ukrainian Saints\" in fact were not Ukrainian (St Moses the Hungarian etc.).\n\nBut this is the pastoral reality of today. I know priests my age who started out as \"Bright-eyed Byzantines\" who got their epitrachelions burned by the people of the parishes they worked at and have adapted their liturgical and devotional perspectives on things.\n\nWhen you become a priest, you'll find that out for yourself.\n\nAs for me, I've had to have too many priestly friends cry on my shoulder . . .\n\nAlex"
