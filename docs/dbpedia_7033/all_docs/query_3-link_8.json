        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 271\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. One God, Amen.\n\nFriends,\n\nThis is a sad development. It proves that Greater Russianism is alive and well, and breathes in the Church. Yet at the same time, I must confess how fascinated I am by the commentary of ALity, Diak, Alex, and ukrainiancatholic.\n\nI will confess my ignorance as a foreigner who used to credit Kyiv monastic accomplishments to the Russians until I read some of your contributions. Worse still, is that it is the present Capital City of Ukraine and there I was crediting it to the Russians. I have the bad habit of concentrating on the history of Russia from 1905 to about 1927. Prompted by some of your comments I pulled some books (dealing with older themes) off my shelf and boy do I feel ignorant as can be. I am astounded that Ukrainians can arrogantly be written out of history by Russians as in that article posted by ALity. I guess His-story vs. History affects more people than my own. I promise to use my free time this summer to read more on the Ukrainian History as opposed to the Muscovite His-Story.\n\nIt double saddens me that, as ALity pointed out, quick fix Pentecostal hucksters are coming in to scavenge souls in peoples time of weakness and stress. But it does not worry me, with the arsenal of Kyiv as a background I don't see that trendy pente move going anywhere except out of style. But ALity I am confused on one point, how is it that you think that going &#8220;English&#8221; will change this? If experience elsewhere can be generalized (and it usually can) then many Ukrainians protestants are already plugged into English. They should have gotten \"scholarships' and are taking \"telenet' courses or pre-tapped courses by some Protestant educational institution right here in America! Considering that Americanization tends to spoil whatever it Americanizes (Tacos and Italian food for instance ) why not try something new and have Americans emerge from their mono-lingual ignorance and learn another language?\n\nBut the point of inspiration in all of your posts comes from the fact that in spite of this treatment and persecution by the Russians you are 1) not generalizing them all and 2) still praying for them that these problems can be overcome. All liturgy and schematics aside, that is my definition of a Christian.\n\nThat the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ&#8212;I Peter 1:7\n\nMay God Have Mercy on us All\n\nAklie Semaet\n\n[ 06-04-2002: Message edited by: Aklie Semaet ]\n\nEgzi'o Marinet Kristos\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Diak,\n\nSt Andrew Boholiubsky is, as we know, honoured as a Ukrainian saint by the Ukrainian Orthodox - and others.\n\nThat he was of the Kyivan Royal line is something about which there can be no doubt. Princes do make wars, as did St Volodymyr and others who are also raised to the altars.\n\nSo we are faced with a dual tradition here. One of these is a religious tradition that sees Andrew as a spiritual Prince operating from good motives.\n\nAgain, and as you say, the jury is out. Ukrainian Catholics are normally biased against him, no matter what. I know I was and, to a great extent, I'm still not crazy about him.\n\nThat doesn't mean that others cannot venerate him for valid spiritual and historical reasons and that we shouldn't respect that.\n\nAndrew was the one who finally got Constantinople to canonize Sts. Volodymyr and Olha as saints, something New Rome was dragging its feet on. The feast of August 1/14 of the Merciful Saviour and the Mother of God was actually ordered by him, and it was he who established the feast of the Protection throughout Rus'.\n\nWe are used to seeing things in terms of nation-states today.\n\nI don't know (and again, \"don't know\") if we can apply that same paradigm to Andrew's taking of the icon of Vyshorod to Vladimir.\n\nThen the entire area was one big Rus'. Andrew considered himself as much a part of a still homogeneous Rus' cultural identity as did everyone else, including the Kyivans.\n\nThe Kyivans also were not angels. For example, St Ihor Olhovych was ill-treated at their hands and killed within the city, even though later the same Kyivan Church glorified him a saint.\n\nCertainly, the Vladimir/Vyshorod Icon of the Mother of God later became a national patron of Muscovite Rus' and became, for all intents and purposes, a \"Russian Icon\" even though it was formerly the holiest Shrine of Kyiv before which even pagan Kyivan princes prayed (e.g. Ihor, husband of St Olha on his return from imprisonment by the Polovtsi).\n\nThe Black Madonna of Czestochowa was similarly enshrined in Kyiv and was later brought to Belz near the border with Poland.\n\nVladislav Opolskie took that icon to Czestochowa, as we know.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Orthodox Ukrainian Prince St. Theodore Ostrozhky, while on a peace mission in Poland, saw the icon and immediately proceeded to try and take it off the wall.\n\nHe was arrested and tried for \"blasphemy\" by the Poles.\n\nDuring his trial, he said that the icon was from Rus' and he was only trying to reclaim it to take it home.\n\nThe icon of Mariapoch in St Stefan's Kirche in Vienna is a similar case and there are other icons of Kyivan Rus' that have met a similar fate.\n\nSome have said that the removal of the people's icons and shrines to a foreign land, usually the land of the oppressing country, was a way to subdue the oppressed people, as they had to go on pilgrimage to their icons in the foreign lands.\n\nAnd because the icon was in the land of the oppressor, somehow, in the people's consciousness, the enemy state became less of an enemy.\n\nSo political motives dominate throughout, to be sure.\n\nI'm just not so sure about the motives of St Andrew Boholiubsky at a time when Rus' was united and the Russian/Ukrainian situation had not yet arisen.\n\nAlex\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 268\n\nQuote\n\nLVIV, UKRAINE, Apr 27, 02 (RISU.org.ua) &#8211; According to a press release of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP), a group of construction workers were attacked in their dormitory the night of 14 April 2002 in the village of Blahodatne, Amvrosiivskyi district, Donetsk region (eastern Ukraine). The workers are involved in building the local church of the Ascension (UOC-KP). In a press release dated 19 April, the UOC-KP accuses the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) of organizing the attack. The UOC-MP press service, in response, calls the UOC-KP press release &#8220;a lie.&#8221;\n\nA group armed with wooden sticks and metal pipes broke into the dormitory in Blahodatne and beat the construction workers, threatening worse if the workers did not leave the village. Blahodatne is the birthplace of Patriarch Filaret, head of the UOC-KP.\n\nA few months previously, the local UOC-MP priest had threatened the UOC-KP faithful and construction workers. The UOC-KP press service, consequently, calls the events which occurred in Blahodatne &#8220; a planned action, organized by the local criminal element and the clergy of the UOC-MP.&#8221; The UOC-KP has asked the civil authorities and the police to protect their faithful from &#8220; violence on the part of the UOC-MP.&#8221;\n\nY. Doroshenko, adviser to the head of the UOC-KP, reported that the Moscow Patriarchate has recently conducted a number of attacks against the Kyivan Patriarchate. He says, &#8220;if the aggressiveness of the UOC-MP is convulsions before death, that is one matter. But, if this is part of a general strategic plan that has been conceived in the heads of foreign politicians, then the Ukrainian citizenry should take a careful look at these events and pay attention to who is playing what role in this game.&#8221;\n\nThe UOC-MP press service responded that this announcement of the UOC-KP is &#8220;yet another lie and fabrication of the Filaretites&#8230; Don't take offense at their religious convictions and interdenominational disputes, which Filaret and his pseudochurch are constantly provoking. This is the legal right of any territorial community in Ukraine. The residents of Blahodatne were simply exercising this right.&#8221;\n\nSources: www.kievpatr.org.ua [kievpatr.org.ua] and www.orthodox.org.ua [orthodox.org.ua]\n\nHere is another recent incedent, although a month older in the birthplace of Patriarch Filaret. The responses of the UOC-MP are interesting considering the use of words and their emotive aspect of the response.\n\nAny true believing Russian Orthodox Christian should be ashamed of their Church and publically condemn their leaders.\n\nALity\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 268\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by Aklie Semaet:\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.

This is a mandate from our Lord Jesus Christ!\n\nIn the USA, that would mean that while continuing to serve Ukrainian immigrants, the Church, in MHO, should focus it's liturgical life in the English Language and seek to convert Americans, from all nations, who find the Kyivan spiirituality speaking to their soul.\n\nThis actually has a desirable consequence for Ukrainians who put their nationality above their faith. Especially concerning this forum: It means that if our church was to begin a successful evangelization effort, converts would learn the history of the Kyivan Church, gradually, from the Ukrainian perspective. This would do more good for the advance of secular Ukrainian interests than anything else! And, it would more fittingly be a blessing for doing the truly right thing first, spreading the gospel.\n\nThe Russian viewpoint is generally accepted to the west, because it was propagandized to the west. By doing the right thing, preaching the gospel, in our tradition, there is a corollary benefit. And that benefit is that converts will learn \"Kyiv-ite\" interpretation of Kyivan Rus'.\n\nOne need only look at the historical perspective of Kiev, by the American OCA, which propagates the Russian version of Kievan-Rus.\n\nAlas, as Alex and Taras Shevchenko spoke before him, and myself, Ukrainians are the reason for much of their woes. Our inward pride and utter dysfunctional ability to be divided and unable to work together for our common good, is the mark of a defeated and conquered people. The hope of our Church, and extension culture, are in it's leaders and faithful from the West, who are able to provide for themselves and learn the truth of their patrimony. Looking at Ukraine, our Patriarch, is (was) and American and grew up in the west and the head of perhaps the most promising organization in Ukraine, the LTA is headed and was resurrected by an American priest, Fr. Borys Gudziak. There were many in our church who felt such an organization would lead people away from the faith and did not want to support it in it's early stages (1992). So, although long winded as I am, I think I was able to explain my statments.\n\nNow await, Alkie, and watch Ukrainian Jurisprudence in action, as my Ukrainian Catholic \"comrades\" on this forum hurl \"village-polemic\" hand grenades at my comments!\n\nO Lord, Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.\n\nALity\n\nMember\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 784\n\n\"This was more a message to uc, whom I have dome longstanding discussions with about the nature of the Church.\"\n\nAs always you catch me hook, line, and sinker.

I know of people who attend Russian or Greek or Slavic or Irish ethnic churches who really are attracted by the culture and their form of worship.\n\n\"As a part of the Catolic Church, we are called to evangelize all nations, not just Ukrainians.\"\n\nMy theory is we need to claim back all of the baby boomers and people of my parents generation back. In most Ukrainian churches you will see 80% elderly, and a few families with small kids. Very very few in between. So lets reclaim that boomer generation. I know of over 15 Ukrainian Catholics that go to the RC church by my house. I am sure we could have at least 2 or 3 more parishes here in San Diego if all the cradles were active. So lets evangilize our once own first.\n\n\"This actually has a desirable consequence for Ukrainians who put their nationality above their faith. \"\n\nWell thats why halls are social clubs most of the time.

Borys Gudziak has been a shot in the arm for the LTA, although Father Dimid wasn't too bad, was wonderful spiritually, although I think Fr. Gudziak has the vision to take the LTA to the next step. I had to read his book on the Union of Brest for my diaconal program - if you want some light reading (it's a big book) go for it. Also Hlib Lonchyna, a wonderful Studite from Steubenville, Ohio, is auxiliary of L'Viv. I was hoping we would get him for St. Nicholas in Chicago, but it looks like Patriarch Lubomyr wants to keep him close.\n\nThere comes a time when an equation is reduced to an empirical relationship. MP has a need to claim and usurp the patrimony of Kyiv, precisely because Kyiv is where the ecclesiological, liturgical, and theological tradition of MP lies. If MP doesn't control Kyiv, then, it would have to recognize (gasp) that some other Ukrainian ecclesiological entity had ownership and control of the land and place where St. Volodymyr and Olha lived, reigned, and established the Kyivan Church from which the Church of Moscow must historically recognize its origin. This kind of violence perpetrated directly or indirectly by the MP isn't going to stop as long as there is \"competition\" (as MP sees it) from the KP. I hope and pray when Patriarch Lubomyr moves the Patriarchate to Kyiv we will be spared this kind of behavior.\n\nThe Kyivan Tradition is universal. It can be experienced in any language. It is not the ethnic or linguistic property of the Ukrainians. ALity, make sure you visit St. Elias in Brampton, Ontario when you are up that way and you will see that the Kyivan Tradition works beautifully in English as well. I take my family up there and to the Studites in Orangeville (only an hour or so from St. Elias) at least once a year for charging the spiritual batteries.\n\nSubdeacon Randolph, a sinner"
