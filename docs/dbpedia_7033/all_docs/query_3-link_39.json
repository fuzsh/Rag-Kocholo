        "text": "The articles in this volume reflect upon divisions within the Orthodox churches, taking recent events in Ukraine as a case study. In my article, I explain that the fault line, inspired by the Constantinople vs. Moscow split, exists not only within the world of Orthodoxy, but also beyond. In fact, with the granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), other Christian denominations and ecumenical institutions—both within and outside Ukraine—have been drawn into the conflict, and forced to choose sides. This article explores the issue, with particular attention given to the Catholic-Orthodox relations. At the international level, the autocephaly of the OCU, and the subsequent break of communion between Moscow and Constantinople, jeopardizes the official theological dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic churches. This dialogue, conducted within the framework of a Joint Commission, has been traditionally marked by high levels of inter-Orthodox tensions, but now, with the departure of Moscow, risks losing its representativeness. The Ukrainian crisis might have repercussions on multilateral ecumenical relations as well, especially if the OCU, supported by Constantinople, decides to seek membership within international bodies, such as WCC or CEC. As far as the Ukrainian context is concerned, Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) has been nurturing a rather positive relationship with the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nothing of the sort has ever occurred between UGCC and the Patriarchate of Moscow. I claim that it was the desire to have a legitimate and open-minded interlocutor on the Orthodox side, rather than the patriotic ethos of Ukrainian Catholics, that has led to such a quick and public embrace of the new Orthodox church by the UGCC. The Heads of both the OCU and the UGCC have immediately expressed their desire to work on a developing of a roadmap for an intense dialogue. However, almost two years after the proclamation of the OCU’s autocephaly, there has been practically no sign that those declarations will be realised any time soon. I highlight the possible causes of this failure. Both the Latin rite Catholic church in Ukraine and the Protestants have been rather silent regarding the inter-Orthodox crisis. However, with the passing of the time and the solidification of the inter-jurisdictional borders of their Orthodox partners, both Roman Catholics and Protestants are likely to be cooperating with both the OCU and the UOC. The crisis provoked by the emergence of the OCU can either become an opportunity for ecumenical dialogue, or, on the contrary, a source of further tension.\n\nThe sanctification of Holy Chrism (myrrh, myron), which is required for the administration of the Sacrament of Confirmation, has always been a right of the bishops. At present, the sanctification of chrism in the Eastern Orthodox Churches has become a patriarchal privilege of the Ecumenical Patriarchate (EP) in Constantinople (C-le), the Moscow Patriarchate (MP), the new Balkan Patriarchates and the Georgian Patriarchate. The exception to the rule is the Orthodox Church in America, whose autocephaly granted by Moscow is not recognised by Constantinople and the Greek churches, however, and which produces and sanctifies the chrism according to its Tomos of autocephaly. The EP opposes the understanding of the system of World Eastern Orthodoxy (“Canonical Orthodoxy”) as \"a confederation or federation of churches\" united by a common creed and communion in the sacraments. In its view, it is necessary to complete the canonical order in such a way that it reflects Constantinople's role as guarantor of pan-Orthodox unity. Therefore, the tomoi of autocephaly granted by the EP include a passage on the reception of Holy Chrism by the new Church from the EP and the right of bishops to appeal to C-le as a higher judicial authority as well as the EP's claim to exclusive jurisdiction over the Eastern Orthodox Diaspora For the Russian Church (and the new Balkan Patriarchates, the Georgian Patriarchate): \"The autocephalous Church itself prepares Holy Myrrh, canonises its saints, prepares new orders of worship (rites) and hymns; autocephalous Churches enjoy full independence in administration and jurisdiction\", so the autocephaly tomoi of the MP either simply contain no restrictions on autocephaly or else an explicit passage on the right of the new Church to produce its own chrism. Local Churches with autonomous right within the framework of the Moscow Patriarchy should obtain chrism from Moscow. Until 1913 the Russian Church had two centres where chrism was produced and sanctified – Moscow and Kiev although the episcopal see of Kiev then lost its previous autonomous right. Local churches with autonomous rights within the framework of the Moscow Patriarchate are to obtain the chrism from Moscow. Thus, the statute of the MP states that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church receives \"the Holy Myrrh from the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus\". (By 1913, the Russian Church had two centres where the chrism was produced and consecrated - Moscow and Kiev, although the episcopal see of Kiev had by then lost its former autonomous rights.) Addendum: Eastern Orthodoxy and the preparation of Holy Chrism in Ukraine. In 1990, the Ukrainian dioceses of the MP were transformed into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOK) - a \"self-governing church with with rights of wide autonomy\". Clergy and lay people that refused to remain within the framework of the MP founded \"uncanonical churches\" (from the perspective of the entire World Orthodoxy of the time). The most important of these, which claimed to join Eastern World Orthodoxy as an autocephalous Ukrainian church, were the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOK-KP, founded 1992) and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOK, founded 1989). After the pro-Western regime change in 2014, the authorities openly supported the UOC-KP in seizing church buildings and appropriating property of the UOC, which was accused of being pro-Russian. In the context of the intensified confrontation with Russia, the UOC was accused of being pro-Russian and the authorities insisted on the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian church within the Eastern World Orthodoxy and conducted negotiations with the EP. In 2018, the EP announced the revocation of the 1668 decision on the subordination of the Kiev Metropolitan Church to the MP, i.e. the restoration of its own jurisdiction in Ukraine, recognised the ordination of the clergy of the UOK-KP and the UOAK, and resumed ecclesiastical communion with them. At a \"Unification Council\" in December 2018, attended by clergy and parishioners of the former UOK-KP and UOAK, as well as two hierarchs of the UOK, the establishment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OKU) was proclaimed. The EP then declared that it considers the hierarchs of the UOK to be titular bishops based in Ukraine. According to the Autocephaly Tomos signed in January 2019, the OKU is confined to the territory of Ukraine, must recognise the EP's responsibility for the 'diaspora', must recognise C-le as the superior judicial authority and is obliged to receive Holy Chrism from C-le. Recently, the autocephaly of the OCU is recognised by the EP, the Patriarchate of Alexandria, (the Synods and the majority of the Bishops) of the Churches of Greece and Cyprus. The MP and the UOC suspended Eucharistic communion with these Churches. After the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022, the seizures of UOC churches and the appropriation of church property intensified. In May 2022, a Church assembly of the UOC (\"Feofania Council\" - FC) was convened in Kiev. The FC condemned the war (item 1), called on the governments of Russia and Ukraine to negotiate (item 2), deplored the MP's stance on the war in Ukraine (item 3) and amended the UOC statute, including by deleting the mention of the MP in the UOC statute). The FK also dealt with the formation of congregations abroad and \"had considerations regarding the resumption of the preparation of myrrh in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\". It was argued that \"myrrh can even be sanctified by any bishop\", but \"in Orthodoxy it is historically the prerogative of the First hierarch of the Church to sanctify myrrh.... (And bishops of the UOC continued to concelebrate with bishops of other local churches that did not recognise the OCU). In November 2022, the Holy Synod of the UOC decided to resume the preparation of Holy Chrism in Kiev. In the UOC it is pointed out that historically the sanctification of the myrrh in Kiev was not dependent on the status of the Kiev episcopal throne. Until 1913 it was produced and consecrated in Kiev, even after the Kiev episcopal see had lost all autonomous rights. By virtue of his apostolic succession, the first hierarch of the UOC has all the means of grace to administer the sacraments of the Church that lead people to salvation. Historically, in Kiev, Holy Chrism was produced and consecrated in St. Sophia Cathedral and, from the 18th century to 1913, in the Holy Dormition Kiev Cave Lavra. In the Soviet era, St. Sophia and the Cave Lavra were nationalised. Since 1988, the \"Lower Lavra\" has been transferred in stages to the Orthodox Church (then MP) for lease, since 2013 for permanent use. However, since December 2022, activities by state agencies and political activists to stop the UOC's activities have increased sharply. The UOK was denied the use of the large church buildings in the \"Upper Lavra\", for which the state museum continued to be responsible. In early March, the management of the Kyiv-Pechersk National Historical-Cultural Protected Area terminated the 2013 lease agreement with the UOC monastery. A contested eviction order requires the administrative bodies of the Kiev Metropolitan Church, the UOC Kiev Spiritual Academy and the monastic community to leave the Lavra area by 29 March. The further consolidation of the UOC through the preparation and sanctification of the Holy Chrism is thus in question on technical grounds alone."
