For the entirety of my young life, the possibility that the Soviet Union might collapse and that independent nations would emerge from the imperial wreckage amounted to a “fool’s hope.” By the end of 1991, it was hard for me to believe that Ukraine was independent. As a child, I attended the Ukrainian Orthodox parishes of my family, and our parish was always the one shepherded by my grandfather, the archpriest (and later protopresbyter) Nicholas Metulynsky. It was upon enrolling at the university and joining the Orthodox Christian Fellowship that I discovered that we were “uncanonical” and “self-consecrated” as adherents of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The passions of youth prevented me from reflecting patiently on my encounters with my Orthodox Christian peers, so I took my frustrations to my grandfather. The next several years constituted a domestic crash course in the history of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. I would visit my grandparents’ home and immerse myself in his fascinating library of books and periodicals, trying to understand the perspective of my fellow Orthodox. The experiences of my youth functioned as an introduction to a world that is even more complex than I had imagined it to be. My musical skills brought me to non-Ukrainian Orthodox parishes where I learned the unique histories of other traditions. Inspired by the legacy of Alexander Schmemann, I pledged myself to the cause of establishing an authentically local Orthodox Church in America, rooted in mission, by joining the Orthodox Church in America and attending its renowned St. Vladimir’s Seminary. Eventually, I immersed myself in liturgical studies, and have been blessed to land my first appointment, and tenure, at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. My path continues to be blessed, as I begin a new chapter as Jochum Professor and chair at Valparaiso University in Indiana. As I continued my work in liturgical studies, I never forgot my crash course in Ukrainian church history. I exchanged hundreds of e-mails on the chaotic church situation in Ukraine, and discovered that many of my peers had no knowledge of the Church in Ukraine. I wrote a handful of articles and essays in an attempt to\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nexplain the intra-Orthodox tensions in Ukraine for English-speakers These initial presentations evolved into a series of conference papers, and before I knew it, I already had collected much of the material needed for this book. My objective is the same as it was originally: to explain the situation of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine as clearly as possible. The primary purpose of the book is to illustrate how aspirations for autocephaly and church renewal caused the Orthodox Church in Ukraine to splinter over the span of one hundred years. The features and objectives of autocephaly developed a stigma of ecclesial illegitimacy, and the inability of church leaders to shed this stigma has deepened the divisions and sharpened intrachurch polemics. I hope I have achieved this objective with this book: let the reader decide. Every study is the result of dialogue with others, and dozens of people have helped me think through the issues featured in this book. Amy Farranto has been a patient and devoted editor, gently guiding me through the publication process and encouraging me to make the changes needed to improve the text and its arguments. I’m very grateful to Amy for her devotion to publishing this book! Sincere thanks to Dr. Antoine Arjakovsky, Dr. Paul Gavrilyuk, Dr. Roy Robson, and Dr. Christine Worobec, who read multiple drafts and provided me with the critical insight needed to strengthen the manuscript and clarify its arguments. I extend my thanks to numerous people who have engaged me in discussion, especially Dr. Michael Andrec, Nataliya Bezborodova, George Demacopoulos, Fr. Andrii Dudchenko, Daniel Galadza, Fr. Peter Galadza, Brandon Gallaher, Jacob Grekhovetsky, Fr. Dellas Oliver Herbel, Archimandrite Cyril Hovorun, Fr. Paul Koroluk, Fr. Heorhii Kovalenko, Yaroslaw Lozowchuk, Petro Melnyk, Aristotle Papanikolaou, Fr. Michael Plekon, Dr. Constantine Sigov, Frank Sysyn, Halyna Teslyuk, and Fr. Roman Zaviyskyy. I have received encouragement from bishops of the churches who have answered questions and provided me with guidance on sources. Special thanks to Metropolitan Oleksandr (Drabinko) of the UOC-MP, who ensured that I received posthumously published works of the ever-memorable Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan), and Archbishop Yevstratiy (Zoria) of the UOC-KP, who answered my questions patiently. Metropolitan Yurii (Kalishchuk) of the UOCC, and Metropolitan Antony (Scharba) and Archbishop Daniel (Zelinsky) of the UOC-USA have also supported my efforts. Ms. Larissa Bulya of the UOC-USA library in South Bound Brook, New Jersey, sent me several handpicked issues of the Ukrainian Orthodox Word for two projects. This book would have been impossible without the gracious assistance of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. I made two trips to Edmonton, one to deliver the Bohdan Bociurkiw memorial lecture in February 2015, and the other to immerse myself in the Tymofii Minenko archives and the Bohdan Bociurkiw Memorial Library. My second trip\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nwas made possible by the Anna and Nikander Bukowsky research grant I received from the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. Dr. Volodymyr Kravchenko and Ms. Iryna Fedoriw were terrific hosts, and Mr. James Franks made research in the archive a pleasant experience. I am especially grateful to Dr. Heather Coleman for numerous engaging discussions about Ukrainian and Russian history, and for her friendship. In closing, I return to the beginning, the intense discussions about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that occurred in my youth. As a young adult, I was entranced by the beautiful music of Kyrylo Stetsenko, priest and musician of the 1921 UAOC (1882–1922). His niece, Mrs. Kira Tsarehradsky, carried on the Ukrainian musical heritage in the Twin Cities area with skill and grace, and she shared many stories of family reminiscences of the UAOC with me, for which I am very grateful. Thanks to my parents, Eugene (d. 2005) and Olga (d. 2017), who encouraged us to learn about our heritage. My brother Greg and I learned more from our grandparents, Fr. Nicholas and Matushka Margarita, than we could have learned from books, so I dedicate this work to them. In 2016, my wife Tresja and daughter Sophia traveled to Kyiv and L’viv with me. They tolerated my passion and wonder with the unconditional love of family, and I thank them.\n\nAbbreviations and Conventions I am employing abbreviations and conventions in this book to assist the reader in making distinctions between church movements and their periodization.

All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council. The AUOCC was created by the Kyiv eparchy in 1917 to prepare for the All-Ukrainian Church Council scheduled for 1918. The council consisted primarily of Church progressives who favored ecclesial autocephaly for the Church in Ukraine. The AUOCC was briefly disbanded in 1918 after the Kyivan eparchial assembly elected Antony Khrapovitsky as metropolitan of Kyiv and the Church in Ukraine began to prepare for the second session of the All-Ukrainian Council. The AUOCC reassembled in 1919 and aggressively pursued a program of Ukrainization within the Church in Ukraine, working with the local Soviet authorities to acquire permission to use temples for Ukrainian-language liturgical services. The AUOCC came into open conflict with the bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine and became the primary group seeking the creation of a Ukrainian Church\n\nAbbreviations and C onventions\n\nxiii\n\nliberated from Russian control and completely independent. The AUOCC’s efforts resulted in the creation and promulgation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in 1921. The AUOCC was the chief administrative organ of the 1921 UAOC until its liquidation by the Soviet state in 1930. 1921 UAOC. Refers to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church established in October 1921. The 1921 UAOC came into being in October 1921 when a council consisting of laity and clergy, most of whom were suspended or deposed, gathered and created their own episcopate by an innovative conciliar rite of ordination. No bishops participated in the council. The 1921 UAOC fiercely promoted liberation from the Moscow Patriarchate, Ukrainization of all aspects of church life, democratic and egalitarian principles of governance within the church, and the promotion of innovative canons that permitted bishops to be married. The 1921 UAOC grew rather rapidly until the Soviet state began to persecute it in 1926–1927; no Orthodox church in the world recognized the 1921 UAOC as legitimate. Several pejorative terms caricatured the 1921 UAOC, including uncanonical, samosviati (self-consecrated), bezblahodatni (without grace), and Lypkivtsi (disciples of Vasyl Lypkivs’kyi, the charismatic leader of the UAOC from 1921 to 1927). An extraordinary council assembled in 1930 to proclaim the self-liquidation of the 1921 UAOC; this council was orchestrated by the Soviet authorities. 1942 UAOC. Often referred to as the second rebirth of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the 1942 UAOC was created in German-occupied Ukraine in 1942 when the head of the Orthodox Church in Poland, Metropolitan Dionysii (Valedynsky), appointed Archbishop Policarp (Sikorsky) as the temporary administrator of the Autocephalous Church in Ukraine in late 1941. The 1942 the UAOC attained autocephaly when several bishops were consecrated to form an episcopate in February of that year. The church was de facto autocephalous, although its bishops officially designated Metropolitan Dionysii as their head. The 1942 UAOC was essentially a new church in Ukraine because they disavowed the canons and ecclesiology of the 1921 UAOC while retaining the first church’s program of Ukrainization and opposition to the Moscow Patriarchate. The 1942 UAOC rejected the pledge of loyalty made to the Soviet Union by Moscow metropolitan Sergei (Stragorodsky) in 1927, and maintained a consistent anti-Soviet, anti-Bolshevik platform. The bishops of the 1942 UAOC welcomed the Germans as liberators when they defeated the Soviets in 1941; this stance put the bishops of the 1942 UAOC (along with many other bishops in Ukraine and Russia) at odds with the leaders of the Moscow Patriarchate, who were nominally loyal to the Soviet state. The 1942 UAOC came into conflict with a cohort of bishops that reverted to the autonomous canonical status of the Church in Ukraine under the Moscow Patriarchate in 1941. This church became known as the Autonomous Church, and they favored the use of Church Slavonic in the liturgy. The conflict between the 1942 UAOC and the Autonomous Church became permanent when the 1942 UAOC received surviving clergy of the 1921 UAOC through a special rite of reception as opposed to a new\n\nxiv\n\nAbbreviations and C onventions\n\nordination. The bishops of the 1942 UAOC left Ukraine and immigrated to Western Europe and North America beginning in 1945, following World War II. 1989 UAOC. Also known as the third rebirth of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the 1989 UAOC came into existence when parishes in L’viv and other cities in Western Ukraine defected from the Moscow Patriarchate to reconstitute the UAOC. The 1989 UAOC kept the primary principles of the 1942 UAOC, but in a new development, assigned itself patriarchal status. In June 1990, the 1989 UAOC elected Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) as its patriarch, strengthening its connection to the 1942 UAOC, as Mstyslav was one of the bishops ordained to the episcopate in German-occupied Ukraine. In June 1992, the UAOC held a council at which a merger was announced with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the leadership of Metropolitan Filaret (Denysenko). At this time, the united churches changed the official name to Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate. In reality, three churches resulted from the merger, as a minority of bishops and parishes, including Patriarch Mstyslav, rejected the council and the merger, and remained within the UAOC. Furthermore, the vast majority of the bishops and parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under Moscow rejected the merger and remained under the leadership of Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan), who was elected in a controversial bishops’ council held in Kharkiv in May 1992. For the purposes of this study, the 1989 UAOC refers to the church that existed up until the June 1992 council in Kyiv. After the June council, I refer to three distinct churches: UAOC (the small minority that rejected the June council), the UOC-KP (the church emerging from the council members who accepted its resolutions), and the UOC-MP (the church remaining under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate). KP and UOCKP are equivalent. UGCC refers to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, the large Byzantine-rite church that claims to be the legitimate heir of the Kyivan Metropolia, asserts patriarchal status, and that restored communion with the Roman Catholic Church at the Union of Brest in 1596. Most of the Orthodox laity rejected the union, and the patriarchate of Jerusalem restored the Orthodox hierarchy of the Kyivan Metropolia in 1620. The UGCC was coerced by Soviet officials to return to the Orthodox Church at a council in L’viv in 1946. The UGCC returned to Ukraine in 1989 and has often come into conflict with Orthodox churches, especially the Moscow Patriarchate. EP. The book often refers to the EP, or Ecumenical Patriarchate: this is the ancient church of Constantinople, which is considered to be the “first among equals” within the family of Orthodox churches. MP. Moscow Patriarchate. Sobornopravnist’. Refers to the notion of church government by council. Similar to sobt ornost’ in nomenclature, sobornopravnist’ was actually democratic and egalitarian. The 1921 UAOC implemented sobornopravnist’ as the governing principle for the church, a system that significantly reduced the authority of synods and bishops within the church.\n\nAbbreviations and C onventions\n\nxv\n\nUkrainians debated the proper place of sobornopravnist’ within the life of the church throughout the twentieth century.

Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and other churches and religious organizations have historical roots in Ukraine and remain active in the present day. Most Ukrainians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians, and among Ukraine’s Orthodox Churches a state of confusion prevails.1 The Orthodox Church is the dominant religious organization in Ukraine, as it is in other East Slavic nations such as Russia, Belarus, Bulgaria, and Serbia. However, unlike the Orthodox populations in most of these other countries, Ukraine has three Orthodox churches that claim to be the legitimate heirs of the medieval Kyivan see (or metropolia), a church born from the legendary baptism of Kyiv by Grand Prince Volodymyr in 988. Today’s three Orthodox churches in Ukraine do not coexist peacefully. They are stuck in the cycle of an intrachurch polemical war, and each church appeals to political and ecclesial entities in and outside of Ukraine for endorsement of its legitimacy. Within the global Orthodox church community, there is a dominant narrative referring to an episode in the early 1990s that catalyzed the disruption of church unity and led to Orthodox plurality in Ukraine. According to this version of events, Metropolitan Filaret (Denysenko), who presided over the Orthodox Church in Ukraine from 1966 to 1992, fomented schism in the Kyivan Church when he voluntarily left the Moscow Patriarchate (MP) and merged with most of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) to form the Kyivan Patriarchate (KP) in June of 1992. This prevailing narrative asserts that Filaret was angered by the lack of support for Ukrainian autocephaly in Moscow and among a few of the bishops on the Kyivan Church’s synod. At the Bishops’Council of the Russian Orthodox Church held in March–April 1992, he was asked to submit his resignation, and agreed to do so, but then he rescinded and led those who followed him into schism. Filaret, for his part, claims that his promise to resign was extracted under pressure and that he acted responsibly when he returned to Kyiv to resume his church’s move towards autocephaly.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe turmoil among the Orthodox in Ukraine has implications beyond determining the truth between competing versions of events. For the Orthodox people of Ukraine, the current divorce among the Orthodox raises questions about the legitimacy of clerical ordinations, baptisms, and marriages, especially those performed in the Kyivan Patriarchate (KP) and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC). Orthodox people belonging to these churches may be required to be rebaptized or remarried if they attend a Moscow Patriarchate (MP) parish. The sister Orthodox churches of the world need to know with whom they can pray and worship, and how to receive clerical and lay delegations representing the three churches. The Ecumenical Patriarchate (EP) and the MP disagree on who possesses the authority to adjudicate and mediate the Ukrainian problem, as they both claim to be the mother church of the Kyivan Metropolia. Their dispute compromises the authority of the EP within the global communion of Orthodox churches, as the MP’s history of granting autocephaly to churches in the twentieth century places it on an equal footing with the EP. The EP and MP continue to disagree on the mechanism for granting autocephaly to an Orthodox church, an issue related to their divergent interpretations of canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon (451).2 The dispute concerns primacy within the Orthodox Church, as the EP refers to canon 28 from the Council of Chalcedon as the authoritative text recognizing the primacy of the EP among the Orthodox Churches, an authority that would grant the EP the right to grant autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine, not the MP.3 The MP would stand to lose millions of people and thousands of parishes were the Church in Ukraine to become completely and permanently autocephalous. Ukraine has a great deal at stake. After the bloodshed from the wars of the twentieth century and the persecutions of the Soviet regime, Ukraine has struggled to attain stability and internal unity in the post-Soviet period. The Orange Revolution (2004), Maidan crisis (2013), annexation of Crimea (2014), and war in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to the present) are the results of Russian aggression and divisions among the Ukrainian people. The intense disputes among the Orthodox churches in Ukraine constitute a microcosm of the current political crisis, which is why President Petro Poroshenko and Ukraine’s parliament have repeatedly appealed to the EP and the Holy and Great Council in Crete to end the church war by granting the Ukrainian Church autocephaly and contributing to the liberation of Ukraine from Russian colonialism.\n\nThe Problem: Nationalism, Autocephaly, and Ukrainization The rationale for Ukrainian autocephaly and its Ukrainianizing agenda are the central issues of dispute among the Orthodox churches in Ukraine. The\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nrelationship between national sovereignty and ecclesial autocephaly belongs to modernity, as the movement for church autocephaly coincided with the struggle to establish a Ukrainian republic in the early twentieth century.4 At the global level, the Orthodox Church has felt the impact of the emergence of the nation-state. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the patriarchate of Constantinople recognized the autocephaly of the churches in Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Poland. This action of establishing canonical territories in the Orthodox ecclesiological structural system responded to the changes caused by political reconfiguration. In 1872, the Synod of the Church of Constantinople protected the integrity of local churches’ ecclesial autocephaly from the heresy of ethnophyletism, in which a local church’s identity is exclusively national. The specter of ethnophyletism has hampered the movement for autocephaly in Ukraine for nearly a century as the chief ideologues of the Ukrainian autocephalous movement often had experience in serving as public officers or publicly declared themselves to be patriots. In all the phases of its modern history, aspirations for liberation from the oppressor (tsarist, Soviet, Nazi, and Russian) and the process of nation-building coincided with passionate pleas for ecclesial autocephaly. The national element of the Ukrainian Church movement has perhaps been the greatest obstacle to achieving recognition of ecclesial autocephaly. Despite the coincidence of nation-building and the movement for autocephaly, the role of nationalism in the movement for Ukrainian Church independence is not easily settled. The rationale for Ukrainian autocephaly followed the modern template of Orthodoxy, which recognized the local church in the modern nationstate, as the larger regional structures corresponding to old imperial borders diminished. Furthermore, the autocephalous movement envisioned the restoration of the Kyivan Church and the return of its native traditions. The precedents established by the recognition of autocephaly of churches in neighboring states would thus apply to the Kyivan Church; it would be natural for this church to be autocephalous in an independent Ukrainian republic. The proposals for autocephaly included petitions for Ukrainization, especially the introduction of vernacular Ukrainian to the liturgy. Ukrainization proved to be the primary symbol of the uneasy relationship between autocephaly and Ukrainian nationalism, as Orthodox leaders and believers viewed it as either a legitimate organic development of Church traditions, or a Trojan horse for the promotion of nationalism. This study aims to show how the failure of Orthodox Church leaders to reach a consensus on autocephaly and Ukrainization resulted in the splintering of the Church and a pattern of dispute that evolved from 1917 to 2016. I show how the separated churches developed public religious identities that were based primarily on their respective positions on autocephaly, Ukrainization, and the stigma of illegitimacy. One hundred years of polemical exchanges, statements, appeals,\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nletters, and decrees by leaders of the separated Orthodox churches in Ukraine have contributed to the formation of these distinct identities. Each church’s public identity is shaped by the definitions articulated by its leaders, and those assigned to it by its opponents. My study also elaborates the development of a series of political theologies within the historical contexts of the churches. These theologies are based on liberation from external aggressors (especially the tsar), the compatibility of sobornopravnist’ with Western values of democracy, and the Russkii mir ideology that sought to restore an idealized image of medieval Rus’ on the basis of contemporary Russian nationalism.5\n\nHistorical Events That Shaped the Movement for Autocephaly and Ukrainization Shifts in political boundaries, imperial allegiances, and church affiliations necessitated adjustment on the part of Ukrainians in the Kyivan Metropolia and created the conditions for autocephaly and Ukrainization at the dawn of the twentieth century. The first separation occurred when the episcopate of the Kyivan Metropolia ratified the Council of Florence and renewed communion with the Roman Catholic Church at the Union of Brest in 1596.6 Most of the laity rejected the union, and the Kyivan Metropolia was without an episcopate until Patriarch Theophanes of Jerusalem renewed it in 1620. The metropolia existed in a Polish orbit, and its Westernization resulted in the emergence of educational systems based on the Jesuit model, advocated by the laity and fully established by Metropolitan Petro Mohyla.7 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the laity assumed leadership of the Church, an important episode in the history of the metropolia that the ideologues of the twentieth century sought to renew in their dream of the restoration of the Kyivan Metropolia. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries required another adjustment on the part of the metropolia, as the Treaty of Pereiaslav in 1654 brought Kyiv and the Church into the Muscovite orbit.8 The subjugation of the metropolia to the MP in 1686 completed the process of union. Ukrainians exercised considerable influence in the upper echelons of the Russian Church during this period, but there were also episodes of friction between Russians and Ukrainians, especially concerning the legitimacy of Kyivan Church traditions.9 The friction between peoples also had a political component, as Russian rulers attempted to quell Cossack rebellions, culminating in Ivan Mazepa’s alliance with the Swedes against the Russians in 1709. Empress Catherine II established firm control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks by abolishing their status of political autonomy and Russifying their elites.10 In the mid-nineteenth century Tsar Nicholas I punished the poet Taras\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nShevchenko, who dreamed of an independent Ukraine.11 Decades of Russification followed in the late nineteenth century. The imperial regime’s punishment of Ivan Mazepa in the eighteenth century and Taras Shevchenko in the nineteenth, as well as its Russification policies, transformed the figure of the tsar into an antagonist for Ukrainians in the twentieth century. When the twentieth-century movement for church renewal in the Russian empire introduced models for modernization of church life, such as the creation of conciliar structures strengthening the role of the laity, the creation of lay preachers, and the introduction of vernacular in the liturgy, and the tsarist regime collapsed, adjustments to new political and ecclesial conditions gained speed and resulted in the creation of a republic of Ukraine (June 1917) and eventual independence (January 1918), as well as the splintering of the churches in Ukraine.12 The convergence of church renewal and political chaos created a perfect storm. In Russia, the Moscow Council of 1917–1918 restored the patriarchate (which had been abolished in the early eighteenth century), but had to defer many of the proposals that would introduce renewal because of a lack of funding and the fierce persecution of the Church by the Bolsheviks. The tsar was not the only public leader whose authority was rejected during the revolution: Orthodox bishops were unable to satisfy everyone who wanted church reform, and this was especially true in Ukraine. Ukraine provided an environment in which an alternative church could arise to challenge the authority of the MP, and a contingent of leaders that formed the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council (AUOCC) could sustain the movement for church renewal that they envisioned would be incarnate in a restored, renewed, and independent Kyivan Metropolia.\n\nAutocephaly and Ukrainization at the Councils of 1918 and 1921 The literary corpus of two formative councils, the first in 1918, the second in 1921, provide the primary sources that inform us about the initial separation of Ukrainians from the MP and their disputes on autocephaly and Ukrainization. The 1918 All-Ukrainian Council was convoked in January 1918 at the request of the Church in Ukraine. The Moscow Council, which was still in session, blessed the convocation of the Ukrainian council, which met in three sessions. Until recently, most of the literature on this council could be found only in memoirs, historical monographs, and in information about the Moscow Council. In 2010, Andryi Starodub published the proceedings of the 1918 All-Ukrainian Council, which included a section that assessed the evidence.13 As Starodub mentions, the 1918 council was rejected by many Ukrainians, and there were many figures that remained in the patriarchate who viewed it as an inconsequential gathering.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nHowever, the 1918 All-Ukrainian Council is regarded as a canonical gathering and thus has implications for two of the most important features of this study.14 The council’s decisions to seek autonomy within the MP instead of autocephaly, and to reject the liturgical use of vernacular Ukrainian in favor of Church Slavonic became the first primary degree of separation between the Ukrainians and the synod in Ukraine. The rejection of autocephaly and Ukrainization by the 1918 council catalyzed the initial separation of Orthodox Ukrainians from the Kyivan Metropolia of the MP. For the trajectory of Ukrainian Orthodox history in the twentieth century, the 1918 council was definitive. While the autocephalists rejected its authority, the Ukrainian Orthodox who remained within the Moscow Patriarchate viewed the 1918 council as the most recent ecclesial gathering establishing canonical structures in Ukraine. The 1918 council became pivotal when the Germans liberated Western Ukraine from Soviet rule in 1941, as one cohort of bishops in Volyn’ met at the Pochaiv Monastery and returned to the jurisdiction of Moscow in accordance with the resolutions of the 1918 council in Kyiv. Thus, loyalty to Moscow was not based solely on ideological positions, but also on the reception of the most recent councils of the Church. The 1918 council brings us to the October 1921 council in Kyiv that resulted in the birth of the 1921 UAOC. These conciliar documents include both the proceedings and the conciliar declarations.15 I engage the conciliar documents and the correspondence between the 1921 UAOC and the MP as the primary sources for presenting the causes of separation within the Orthodox Church in Ukraine and the promotion of the objectives of the autocephalists. I also consult Iryna Prelovs’ka’s detailed account of the sources for the history of the Church and memoirs of the council published by the émigré Ukrainian Orthodox community, along with Tetiana Ievsieieva’s analysis of Orthodox Church groups during this period.16 The first part of this study shows how the 1921 UAOC relentlessly pursued the progressive objectives of the church renewal movement while also seeking the restoration of the Kyivan Metropolia. The establishment of a married episcopate through a renovated rite of episcopal consecration caused the stigma of ecclesial illegitimacy to become a permanent scar on the 1921 UAOC and its sympathizers, as traditional Orthodox who were sympathetic to autocephaly could not accept the UAOC because of its disregard for apostolic succession. All other components of modernization hailed by the UAOC, including Ukrainization and a conciliar-oriented ecclesiology, became attached to the stigma of illegitimacy and established a pattern of suspicion of Ukrainian autocephaly in the following decades. Therefore, the initial period of study establishes the features of public religious identities that formed rapidly during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. The 1921\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nUAOC defined its identity through a desire for liberation from the tsar and the bishops loyal to him, its promotion of Ukrainization, and its reception of modernization. The exarchate defined itself by fidelity to canonical norms and traditions, such as the preservation of a monastic episcopate and the official use of Church Slavonic for the liturgy. Autocephaly, Ukrainization, and Canonicity: World War II The methods employed for achieving autocephaly and Ukrainization developed differently among Ukrainians who belonged to the Orthodox Church of Poland. I analyze the evolution of autocephalist aspirations and the resilience of the stigma of ecclesial illegitimacy through the second UAOC, which was established in German-occupied Ukraine in 1942 through the patronage of the autocephalous Orthodox Church in Poland. I discuss how autocephalists hailed the legitimacy of an independent Kyivan Metropolia through the tomos of autocephaly granted by the EP to the Church in Poland in 1924, a document that defined the subjugation of Kyiv to Moscow as uncanonical.17 Documents detailing synodal meetings and correspondence between bishops serve as the primary sources for narrating the emergence of the 1942 UAOC and the creation of the Autonomous Church in Ukraine, with their bishops meeting at the Pochaiv Monastery.18 I analyze these documents to show how Orthodox Ukrainians could not agree on the event that had binding authority for church organization in Ukraine (the 1924 tomos or the 1918 All-Ukrainian Council). I also show how attempts to implement liturgical Ukrainization complicated relations among Orthodox, while the UAOC’s decision to receive clergy ordained by the 1921 UAOC proved to be an insurmountable stumbling block. Chapter 2 also illuminates how alleged collaboration of UAOC leaders with Nazi officials enhanced the perception of illegitimacy associated with the movement for autocephaly. I discuss how these new developments contributed to the evolution of the public ecclesial identities of the Church in Ukraine, as illegitimacy continued to stigmatize the 1942 UAOC, while the autonomist preference for Church Slavonic and fidelity to the 1918 council and traditional liturgical practices was in continuity with the feature of canonicity. Migration of Autocephaly and Ukrainization and the Political Theology of Democracy Chapter 3 examines the Church in North America, which carried the banner in the émigré community for both Ukrainian national sovereignty and ecclesial independence. Two Ukrainian churches are profiled: the one in Canada, which was the largest Church numerically, and the one in the United States, which became the new center for the diaspora church on account of its first bishop, Archbishop\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nMstyslav (Skrypnyk), who later became metropolitan and then patriarch upon his return to Ukraine. This section demonstrates how the aspirations for autocephaly and the problem of ecclesial illegitimacy evolved in conditions outside of Ukraine. I analyze the persistent Ukrainian attempts to overcome the reputation of illegitimacy with three major actions. The UOC-USA corrected the ordination of Archbishop John (Teodorovych) in 1949 by celebrating the rite of monastic tonsure and the rite of ordination with the laying on of hands by two canonical bishops, ritual elements absent from his original ordination in 1921. I also examine the decision of the Canadian (and American) churches to renew communion with the EP in 1990 (Canada) and 1995 (USA), respectively. I discuss how efforts to attain canonical legitimacy were regarded by some people and parishes in Canada as threats to Ukrainian aspirations for autocephaly. Chapter 3 explores the development of a political theology anchored in democracy and freedom, as the UOC-USA exploited American political positions on religious rights in the Soviet Union to delegitimize the MP and attempt to liberate Ukraine’s Orthodox from their new captor, the USSR. These developments demonstrate the evolution of public religious identity in the context of immigration. The émigré churches’ sustained attempts to normalize relations with the EP and correct the ordination of Archbishop John illustrate their desire to legitimize Ukrainian autocephaly and gather all faithful into one united Church. In chapter 4, I profile the patriarchal exarchate’s activity during the Cold War through the celebration of the millennium.19 This section profiles the life of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine with reference to the 1946 synod in L’viv that liquidated the Greek-Catholic Church. I discuss the material published in the exarchate’s Ukrainian-language periodical, Православний вісник, to demonstrate how the new narrative coalesced around the notion that all peoples of Rus’ were again gathered together in one church under Moscow. The promotion of a political theology sponsored by the MP is presented here as a justification of the USSR’s liquidation of the Greek-Catholic Church to eradicate the vestiges of Nazi fascism from the Unia.20 Last, I illustrate the complexity of the multiple identities borne by Orthodox Ukrainians during the Cold War by drawing from the scholarship of Natalia Shlikhta on the subaltern strategies of resistance to the state employed by faithful, clergy, and hierarchs within the Church.\n\nPost-Soviet Identities in Conflict: Ukrainian Autocephaly and Russian Nationalism Chapter 5 examines post-Soviet developments in the public religious identity of the Orthodox churches in Ukraine. The primary topics are the dismissal of the 1989\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nUAOC on the basis of ecclesial illegitimacy,21 the emergence of a new crisis involving dispute about the methods for obtaining autocephaly within the UOC-MP, the creation of the UOC-KP and the rise of Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko), and the responses of the Church to the Russian nationalism espoused by Patriarch Kirill (Gundiaev)’s Russkii mir strategy.22 The chapter examines how Church leaders attempted to gain both state and popular support during epic events affecting Ukraine, including the 2004 Orange Revolution, the Maidan crisis, and the annexation of Crimea and war in Eastern Ukraine. It also shows how the legacy of narratives of illegitimacy both defined the identities of the respective churches and imposed identities on their competitors. The UAOC’s election of Patriarch Mstyslav and promotion of Ukrainization retained the legacy of the diaspora churches, but were construed as illegitimate because of their connection to the 1921 UAOC. The KP also followed the path of the UAOC through its campaign for autocephaly and Ukrainization, but its appointment of Patriarch Filaret raised the question of legitimacy because of the MP’s deposition of Filaret from holy orders and anathematization from the Church. Change in the public religious identity of the UOC-MP was the most intriguing development of this period. The UOC-MP maintained its identity as the only officially canonical Church in Ukraine, but it also pursued modest Ukrainization during the tenure of Metropolitan Volodymyr. This church encountered a new dilemma when it found its post-Soviet destiny challenged by the introduction of the Russkii mir initiative, as it sought to balance its emerging Ukrainian identity with the demands of Russian nationalism promulgated by the MP. The Orthodox churches in Ukraine continue to struggle through a crisis of separation and polemics that has steadily gained momentum since 1917. The instability of the Ukrainian state and the many wars that ravaged Ukraine left church leaders without the calm needed to systematically work through their disputes. Autocephaly, Ukrainization, and fierce competition for recognition of legitimacy have deepened the divisions among Orthodox people, and these fissures are detrimental to efforts toward unity. The remainder of this book narrates the separation of the churches in Ukraine, and the problems of the autocephaly agenda and the stigma of ecclesial illegitimacy. I hope that the rest of this story clarifies the problems of autocephaly and Ukrainization, their origins, development, and contributions to the public religious identities of the Orthodox churches in Ukraine, so that readers understand the complex layers of this story and become familiar with its details.\n\n1\n\nThe First Autocephalist Movement and the Creation of the UAOC (1917–1930)\n\nThis chap ter narrates the story of the attempt to establish autocephaly in a renewed Kyivan Metropolia in the early twentieth century. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church of 1921–1930 (1921 UAOC) took bold steps by recreating the Kyivan Metropolia on the foundational principles of liberation, Ukrainization, and modernization.1 The main events leading up to the formation of the 1921 UAOC include the eparchial assemblies of 1917, the 1918 All-Ukrainian Council, and a series of confrontations between the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council (AUOCC) and the synod of bishops of the Ukrainian Exarchate (under the Moscow Patriarchate). This resulted in the restoration of a distinct public identity featuring liberation, newness, and a flattened ecclesiology. Plurality in Orthodox religious identity also emerged, as evidenced by Ukrainization within the patriarchal exarchate.\n\nThe Origins of the Ukrainian Autocephalist Movement In the nineteenth century, a sense of national consciousness began to develop among Ukrainians. Churchmen were included among the intellectuals who sought the creation of an independent church alongside a sovereign state. The Ukrainian intellectuals who adhered to the national dream were aware of the formation of autocephalous churches in Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The Bulgarian example was a cautionary tale, since the movement for autocephaly introduced the unfortunate tendency for churches to exclude anyone who was not ethnically Bulgarian from membership and participation. The Constantinopolitan synod of 1872 condemned this policy as ethnophyletism, the heresy of limiting participation in ecclesial life to people of an exclusive national identity.2 The Ukrainians who dreamed of an autocephalous church sought to excise their notion of a unique religious identity from the amalgamation of identities that had formed during the period of Kyiv’s annexation to the Russian empire.\n\n14\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nThe aspirations for an autocephalous church in Ukraine began in the late nineteenth century as a component of national awakening and the objective of liberating the people from impoverished living conditions. Arsen Zinchenko characterizes the program for autocephaly as originating with larger political, community, educational, and cultural movements tinged with nationalism.3 According to Zinchenko, the entire prerevolutionary national movement emphasized the villages and the peasants who constituted the backbone of Ukraine’s agricultural output. Political ideologues implicated the institutional synodal church as one of the worst offenders in failing to elevate the lives of the people in the village. Progressive clergy and political thinkers caricatured the seminaries as places where clergy were discouraged from reading the daily news and becoming aware of the state of affairs throughout the empire. Some rank-and-file clergy were among those who were not only interested in peoples’ ordinary lives, but also proposed programs of church reform which that strengthen the bonds between the people and the Church. Teachers such as Volodymyr Chekhivsky and S. M. Ivanitsky advocated for Ukrainianizing the curriculum of the Podil’ Seminary by pressuring parents of seminarians to demand the creation of a chair of Ukrainian language, literature, and history.4 Zinchenko introduces multiple examples of attempts to promote Ukrainization, particularly through education, from the period of 1890 to 1917. For example, a symbol of emergent Ukrainization was the publication in 1906 of the Gospel of St. Matthew in vernacular Ukrainian, the fruit of a collaborative process shepherded by Archbishop Parfenii (Levitsky).5 Archbishop Parfenii also supported the publication of the Paschal Gospel reading and celebrated the first public proclamation of the Gospel lection for Pascha (Easter) in Ukrainian on April 2, 1906, in Kamjanci.6 The outcomes of Ukrainization attempts during this period prefigure the struggle for control of the Kyivan Church that erupted in 1917–1921. Division among the clergy was one of the reasons for the conflict. While bishops such as Archbishop Parfenii advocated for Ukrainization, other hierarchs and clergy opposed it. Zinchenko discusses the fate of Archimandrite Feodosii (Oltarzhevsky), who was appointed as rector of the Kyivan seminary and academy in 1908 and was sympathetic to Ukrainization. Archbishop Antony (Khrapovitsky) of Volyn’ oversaw an examination of the Kyivan academy in 1908, and recommended revisions while accusing several professors of plagiarism, incompetence, liberalism, atheism, and having sympathy for revolution, which constituted an “adversarial stance toward the Orthodox Church.”7 In 1908 several professors were removed from their posts, and Archimandrite Feodosii was likewise removed from his post as rector. While this episode suggests that Ukrainization was connected to the larger revolutionary movement sweeping through the empire, a closer look suggests that the Ukrainian\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n15\n\nmovement envisioned reforms that would strengthen the relationship between the Church and the people, and that would encourage the clergy to serve the people beyond the administration of the sacraments. Zinchenko refers to the program for church renewal proposed by M. Mikhnovsky of the Ukrainian National Party in 1902, which was published in 1906.8 The program called for the election of rectors by parishes, the prohibition of appointing parish rectors against the will of the parish, the provision by the parish of financial support for clergy, and periodical local councils to handle all church affairs in Ukraine.9 The primary ideologues of the national movement sought to reform the Church so that the clergy would become active advocates on behalf of the people and attend to their needs and concerns, as opposed to serving a state that exploited them.10 Zinchenko notes that appeals for the “renewal [and] the democratization of the Church through her return to national sources” were published on the pages of Ukrainian periodicals.11 The appeals shed light on the divided loyalties of the clergy, including those who refused to support monarchists and those who belonged to the “Union of the Russian people,” a right-wing party espousing autocracy and Russian nationalism.12 Perhaps the most telling testimony from Zinchenko’s review of this period is his summary of the August 1906 edition of Громадська думка (Community thought), especially its report on the reaction of clergy to the revolutionary episodes of 1905–1906: The events of the last two years stirred up this “dead strength,” requiring it to listen around itself. Priests began to discuss the events, to claim that the All-Russian Church Council was to be convened, to reform church schools . . . the Ukrainian village clergy must place the interests of the Ukrainian people first.13\n\nZinchenko’s review of this period demonstrates that there was a general sentiment in favor of church reform in imperial Ukraine: many politicians and clergy supported the restoration of democratic mechanisms in the life of the Church, the use of vernacular Ukrainian in the liturgy, the updating of schools, and especially attention to the needs of the local people. To be sure, there were also appeals for some form of local Ukrainian Church independence, but these were not uniform. Some envisioned autonomous metropolitanates forming in parallel with autonomous republics, some called for an increase in democratization, especially with reference to the appointment of clergy to parishes, while some called for autocephaly. Alongside the reformers in Kyiv were conservatives who sought no change in church structures and depicted Ukrainianizers as radical revolutionaries. These prerevolutionary divisions would come to a head when the empire fell in 1917 and Ukraine embarked on a road with several paths potentially leading to some form of national and\n\n16\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\necclesial sovereignty, but ultimately resulting in the deepening of divisions within society. The Eparchial Assemblies in 1917 The movement for autocephaly among Ukrainians gained traction and momentum during the course of the 1917 revolution. Ivan Vlasovs’kyi cites Anton Kartashev, who described the political environment of the former Russian empire as one of “the liquidation of the previous governors and police rulers.”14 Kartashev goes on to describe the arrest of bishops who were well known for their connections with the tsarist regime or with Grigorii Rasputin. In the spring and summer of 1917, a series of eparchial assemblies occurred throughout Ukraine.15 Vlasovs’kyi states that the assemblies occurred with the participation of laity, a new development that began during the the revolution of 1905.16 The delegates at the assemblies took up the question of how the Church was to reclaim moral and spiritual authority in society with the fall of the tsarist regime and the status of the autonomy of the Kyivan Metropolia within the Moscow Patriarchate.17 At the eparchial assembly of Poltava, several questions concerning the potential Ukrainization of the Church were raised.18 The Kyivan eparchial assembly elected a commission on the convocation of an All-Ukrainian Church Council that would consist of clergy and laity from all eparchies in Ukraine. In his memoirs on the rebirth of the Ukrainian Church, Metropolitan Vasyl Lypkivs’kyi also attributed the movement for Church rebirth to the eparchial assemblies that had gathered throughout Ukraine.19 Lypkivs’kyi referred to the influence on the Church of Ukraine’s gradual separation from Russia, noting the formation of Ukrainian armed forces in September and October.20 He added that many clergy ministering to the military engaged one another in active discussion on how the create a distinctly Ukrainian church. Thus, the origins of the creation of a Ukrainian Church in late 1917 occurred in concert with the formation of the Ukrainian state. Many of the clergy working for a Ukrainian Church formed the core group of the newly formed All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council (AUOCC), which petitioned Patriarch Tikhon for the convocation of a council.21 The composition of the leaders of the AUOCC was decidedly pro-Ukrainian, and they encountered opposition in Kyiv, especially among the bishops.22 First, Metropolitan Volodymyr (Bogoiavlensky) of Kyiv was initially opposed to the eparchial assemblies, but eventually assented.23 The council asked Metropolitan Volodymyr to abandon his see in Kyiv.24 In his historical assessment of these eparchial assemblies, Metropolitan Feodosii (Protsiuk) concludes that the assemblies considered canonical autocephaly but voted in favor of autonomy.25 The evidence shows that the eparchies desired independence and even Ukrainization, but did not agree on whether its canonical form should be autonomy or autocephaly.\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n17\n\nKartashev argues that the extraordinary eparchial assemblies were necessitated by a process of destruction and reconstruction of national and religious structures throughout the entirety of the empire. One of the potential outcomes of this process was the reconfiguration of Ukrainian eparchies connected to an AllUkrainian church center.26 Such a reorganization of the eparchies seemed possible when a chorus of voices called for the All-Ukrainian Council of clergy and laity to determine the next phase of ecclesial life in Ukraine. Vlasovs’kyi notes that the restoration of ecclesial autonomy was the original goal of those who supported such a gathering. He quotes a priest, P. Korsunovsky, who said “there were no thoughts about autocephaly at that time, just as there was no thinking about the complete independence of Ukraine at the time. There were thoughts that following the collapse of the monarchy, the Ukrainian and Russian nations would live in brotherly concord in a free Russia.”27 During the revolution, as the Ukrainian church movement gained momentum, Metropolitan Volodymyr issued an archpastoral epistle published in the church periodical Kyivan Eparchial News.28 He suggested that Orthodox Ukrainians and Russians should build “one great Orthodox Russian Church” together.29 Iryna Prelovs’ka summarized Metropolitan Volodymyr’s letter as a “testimony of the reasons . . . that explain the impossibility of separating the Russian and Ukrainian Churches.”30\n\nThe Moscow Council of 1917–1918 The entire church was adjusting to the new situation in the former empire. The collapse of the monarchy and its replacement by the provisional government headed by Alexander Kerensky simultaneously challenged the Orthodox Church and provided it with an unanticipated freedom. The Orthodox Church in Russia had paved a path toward reform and renewal since the early twentieth century, when the bishops began the process of convoking a council to address several matters affecting the life of the Church in Russia. Many of the issues also pertained to the establishment of Ukrainian distinctiveness in the Kyivan Metropolia, and these issues included the question of introducing vernacular Russian and Ukrainian into the liturgy, the involvement of the laity in the life of the Church at all of its levels, greater participation of women in the life of the Church, deliberations on the possibilities of reducing the disciplinary measures directed toward divorced or deposed clergy, and an increase in the visible conciliarity of the Church. But the most pressing issue taken up by the Russian bishops was the matter of restoring the Moscow Patriarchate.31 The restoration of the patriarchate would restore an identifiable leader who would be responsible for implementing the measures of renewal in the life of the Church, and would also liberate the Church from the decay caused by its fixed attachment to the state as a result of Peter I’s Spiritual Regulation.32\n\n18\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nThe Moscow Council took place in 1917–1918. In November of 1917, the council elected Metropolitan Tikhon (Bellavin) of Moscow as the new patriarch of the Russian Church.33 Metropolitan Volodymyr of Kyiv, who presided over the opening of the council until Metropolitan Tikhon was elected as chair of the presidium, was the senior bishop during the course of much of the council.34 The council, which met somewhat sporadically on account of the political turbulence, approved the convocation of the All-Ukrainian Council in 1918 and ultimately accepted the Ukrainian council’s declarations of autonomy.35 At least one other matter taken up by the Moscow Council had a profound effect on the future trajectory of church life in Ukraine: the matter of translating church services from Slavonic into Ukrainian. The conciliar liturgical commission had submitted numerous proposals and redactions for the translation of the liturgy into Russian and Ukrainian, and blessings to read the lessons in Slavonic and Russian, or Slavonic and Ukrainian. Metropolitan Evlogy (Georgievsky), who served on the liturgical commission, reported (in his memoirs) that the proposals for translations were turned down, and that “the Ukrainians were furious.”36 Evlogy noted the enormous corpus of work taken on by prestigious scholars of the liturgical commission, and the reluctance of Metropolitan Tikhon to accept the proposals, “for fear of objections, mostly from the Old Believers.”37 But the larger objective of the Moscow Council, to restore the Old Believers to the communion of the patriarchate, did not deter the Ukrainians from seeking episcopal blessings to celebrate the liturgy in the vernacular. Nikolai Balashov’s detailed report on the work of the liturgical commission presents the evolution of the proposals over the course of several months.38 Balashov notes that the proposals were largely produced by Archbishop Evlogy, and in each model promoting either partial or complete use of the vernacular, Russian and Ukrainian are the two languages mentioned. An important revision occurred following the meeting of the liturgical commission on August 12, 1917. The revisions concerned the ten theses of translation for liturgy, and in each case, the word “Ukrainian” (“Украинский”) is replaced by “Little Russian” (“Малороссийский”).39 Balashov suggests that the redaction was executed in response to “the emergence of Ukrainian nationalism and ecclesial separatism.”40 This episode of redaction did not appear to have any bearing on the decision to continue to privilege Church Slavonic as the only approved liturgical language. Balashov’s assessment of the situation following the Moscow Council is perhaps the most accurate of the accounts of the fate of vernacular languages. He states that there is limited evidence of authoritative declarations on liturgical language in the liturgy; the Moscow Council had referred the matter for ultimate resolution to the Holy Synod of Bishops and the Superior Church Council. Balashov notes that the first hard evidence available on the matter occurred with the hearing of\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n19\n\nthe report of Bishop Nazarii (Blinov) in June 1919, who was serving as the vicar of Kyiv eparchy at the time and requested a decision on a petition to use vernacular Ukrainian as a liturgical language.41 The report of tendencies toward Ukrainian separatism at the Moscow Council and the angst surrounding the reluctance to adopt proposals for the use of vernacular in the liturgy amounted to a shift in the strategy of Ukrainians who desired an authentically Ukrainian Church. The absence of permission to use vernacular Ukrainian in the liturgy did not deter the cohort of Ukrainians in Kyiv from celebrating the liturgy in Ukrainian, and therefore the debate about language became the first of several topics of disagreement between Ukrainian cohorts and the council of bishops in Ukraine that led to schism and the development of a distinct public religious identity among autocephalist Ukrainians. The Ukrainian council convened in January of 1918 and continued its work through three sessions, with the second occurring in June 1918, and the third from October through December of the same year.42 The political turbulence impacted its proceedings. In Ukraine, a central committee consisting of several disparate political parties ruled a fledgling Ukrainian national republic in early 1918, only to be temporarily replaced by the Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadsky in April of 1918.43 A Ukrainian Church Committee consisting of elected members from the Kyivan eparchial assemblies was created to begin the process of planning the All-Ukrainian Church Council.44 The church situation mirrored the political one. Hyacinthe Destivelle’s depiction is accurate: “parallel to this political evolution, there were two tendencies within the Ukrainian Church—one in favor of a status of autonomy for the Ukrainian Church within the context of the All-Russian Church, the other in favor of autocephaly.”45 Tensions between Russian and Ukrainian cohorts in Kyiv were high, as evidenced by the memorandum written by Archpriest K. Titov and other clergy in Kyiv on the “chauvinistic politics of a group of Ukrainian clergy.”46 The Moscow Council blessed the convocation of the All-Ukrainian Council that opened on January 7 of 1918 and adopted a draft of its statute on July 9, 1918.47 To place the situation in context, an epic and tragic event affected the environment of the Ukrainian council, which was already complicated by its surrounding political climate. The entire church was shaken by the murder of Metropolitan Volodymyr in January of 1918, an episode that further distanced proponents of Ukrainian ecclesial separatism on account of Metropolitan Volodymyr’s resistance to appeals to Ukrainian nationalism.48 Following Volodymyr’s martyrdom, Metropolitan Antony (Khrapovitsky) was elected as the new metropolitan of Kyiv by a special eparchial council in May 1918.49 Metropolitan Antony was familiar with the Ukrainian situation from his lengthy tenure as archbishop of Volyn’ and Zhitomir, and archbishop of Kharkiv, yet he was also an avowed monarchist and church conservative.50\n\n20\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nThe 1918 All-Ukrainian Council It has been difficult to assess the 1918 All-Ukrainian Church Council without access to its proceedings, which until recently were concealed by archives. The publication of the council’s proceedings by Andryi Starodub in 2010 has made it possible to obtain the declarations of the council, although in terms of its reception and significance, opinions vary. In his memoirs, Metropolitan Evlogy viewed the Ukrainian council negatively in comparison with the potential contributions of the Moscow Council, and he participated in its planning as the bishop of Volyn’. Evlogy highlighted the tensions among the parties in Ukraine, referring to “a mob of bitter Ukrainians aroused by political passions.”51 Angry Ukrainian clergy also tried to influence Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvenskii), who was doing the preparatory work for the council.52 Evlogy described the council as having a powerful anti-Moscow sentiment, with delegates shouting “away with Moscow!”53 It was during this period that the Bolsheviks temporarily seized Kyiv and murdered Metropolitan Volodymyr. Soon afterward, Pavlo Skoropadsky assumed leadership of Ukraine in its brief period as a hetmanate.54 Evlogy presided over the May Kyivan eparchial assembly to elect Metropolitan Volodymyr’s successor, Metropolitan Antony. In July 1918, the All-Ukrainian Council assembled for its second session with Antony as the chair of the presidium, and Evlogy described the council as a “struggle between the Ukrainian and Russian parties” with the desire for autocephaly “relentless.”55 Evlogy’s memoirs mention the presence and activity of the minister of cults under the Hetmanate, Vasyl Zinkivs’kyi who was replaced by Oleksander Lotocky. Evlogy concludes his brief treatment of the council by stating that “we were victorious,” with Lotocky and the struggle for autocephaly defeated. Evlogy also said that “the Ukrainians were fit to be tied.”56 Vlasovs’kyi’s account of the council of 1918 is consistent with Evlogy’s, and Vlasovs’kyi cites Evlogy repeatedly in his account of the proceedings.57 Vlasovs’kyi also refers to the Ukrainian majority at the council, manifested perhaps most powerfully by a lecture given by Ivan (Ohienko) on the work of the council, which ended with the singing of the Ukrainian national anthem, “Ще не вмерла Україна” (“Ukraine has not died yet”).58 Given the principle of conciliarity adopted by the Moscow Council and the Ukrainian council’s general favoring of autocephaly, it is difficult to understand how the council adopted the more conservative course of autonomy and the rejection of Ukrainization, since there seemed to be a pro-Ukrainian majority among the delegates. Vlasovs’kyi casts doubt on the legitimacy of the election of Metropolitan Antony in his analysis of the council, stating that the council violated the Moscow Council’s rule that a candidate required two-thirds of the vote for the election to be valid.59 Vlasovs’kyi’s exploration of the sources available to him led him to conclude that\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n21\n\na certain cohort within the 1918 council attempted to steer the assembly away from the inevitable path of autocephaly. Vlasovs’kyi refers to the memoirs of the priest Korsunowsky, who stated that the preparatory commission had instructed high-ranking clergy to purify the Ukrainian council by removing the “Mazepa element,” a reference to the early eighteenth-century hetman Ivan Mazepa, who was disavowed in Russian history and Orthodox Church circles for joining an alliance with the Swedish king to defeat Russia.60 Vlasovs’kyi cites as an example a group of fifty-two people from Kherson who were not elected as delegates to the council but instead appointed by the eparchial leadership, which was justified by a lack of time to hold elections for a proper eparchial delegation.61 In other words, Vlasovs’kyi asserted that this was an instance of assuring sufficient representation to support the pro-Russian coalition within the council.62 Vlasovs’kyi claimed that the pro-Ukrainian coalition protested the exclusion of members of the Ukrainian Church Committee, who had pushed for the convocation of the All-Ukrainian council, and that Bishop Pimen (as the council chair) refused to bring their proposition to include the pro-Ukrainian council members to the entire assembly, claiming that the Ukrainian church council itself refused representation at the Ukrainian council.63 The perception of an agenda by a pro-Russian minority to remove Ukrainian representation from the council led Vlasovs’kyi to conclude that this was an event “similar to the usurpation by the Catholic political leadership of the Ukrainian Orthodox Council in Brest in 1596.”64 Vlasovs’kyi’s perspective differs from that of Metropolitan Feodosii (Protsiuk), who described the act of removing the former members of the preparatory council as a way of honoring the laity. Feodosii justified this act on the grounds that the members of the preparatory council would indeed become the separatists who were “self-consecrated,” an explicit reference to the autocephalist church that was born in 1921.65 An episode that occurred in 1918 between conciliar sessions illustrates the pressure the Ukrainians placed on the Orthodox bishops to honor Ukrainization. On June 27, 1918, in memory of Ivan Mazepa’s defeat in Poltava, the Ukrainian Church leaders petitioned Metropolitan Antony to serve a panakhyda (brief liturgical office for the dead) on the plaza of St. Sophia Cathedral.66 Metropolitan Antony formally requested that Patriarch Tikhon remove the anathema placed on Mazepa, and the patriarch consented, although Antony declined the invitation to preside at the panakhyda. Instead, Bishop Nazarii of Cherkassk presided, and the panakhyda was served at St. Sophia with the first Ukrainian national choir singing the responses under the direction of Kyrylo Stetsenko. The report indicates that ten thousand people participated, but the service had a distinctly anti-Russian theme as well. The priest Kramarenko addressed the people prior to the panakhyda, and he referred to the anniversary of the defeat at Poltava as the victory of Tsar Peter I over Mazepa.67 The panakhyda served in his memory\n\n22\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nritualized the symbolic battle between Ukraine and Russia, and became a symbol of Ukrainian national and ecclesial independence.68 Two significant perceptions emerge from this brief consideration of Vlasovs’kyi’s perspective. First, Vlasovs’kyi attended to the particular political situation of Ukraine with great detail. For example, he mentions the efforts of Minister of Cults Zinkinvs’kyi to obtain canonical autonomy for the Church in Ukraine: “thus the government regards it as necessary that the organization of the administration of the Ukrainian Church should be translated into autonomous structures” to prevent the influence of adversarial elements.69 Evlogy praised Zinkivs’kyi for his centrist approach to resolving the political divisions of the council.70 Skoropadsky’s cautious approach to the Ukrainian situation resulted in Ukraine seeking a cooperative federation with Russia. Since the July session of the 1918 council had defeated the movement for autocephaly, the pro-Ukrainian cohort temporarily lost interest in the work of the council, which was set to continue in late October under the leadership of Metropolitan Antony. While the Ukrainian Church Council eventually adopted the autonomous path, which was accepted by the Moscow Council, the ongoing political turbulence in Ukraine disrupted both civic and church life. Zinkivs’kyi was replaced as minister of cults by Oleksander Lotocky, an advocate for canonical autocephaly. Lotocky delivered a speech at the third session of the 1918 council on behalf of the government, advocating for ecclesial autocephaly, which he believed was a necessary component not only for the Church, but also for the country.71 Lotocky’s speech did not have any binding authority on the work of the council, which opted for autonomy, a position parallel to Skoropadsky’s conciliatory political approach.72 However, the Hetmanate itself was weak and Skoropadsky himself resigned on December 14, to be replaced briefly by the Directory of the Ukrainian National Republic, a government led by Symon Petliura.73 Thus, Lotocky’s advocacy for canonical autocephaly was short-lived in his capacity as minister of cults under the Hetmanate. However, as Vlasovs’kyi notes, the arguments of the 1918 council resulted in a second significant perception that ultimately sustained the autocephalist movement: the Russian bishops were blamed by the pro-Ukrainian cohort for usurping the council and manipulating its proceedings to further a political agenda. Vlasovs’kyi referred to an example from the appearance of Metropolitan Antony at a public event, the festivities surrounding the opening of the Ukrainian University in Kyiv. Metropolitan Antony delivered a speech at this event (in Russian), and used “Малороссия” and “малороссийский” in place of “Ukraine” and “Ukrainian,” which caused students at the assembly to mock him and call for him to leave. This example of the collision of languages brings us full circle to the matter of liturgical language deliberated at the Moscow Council. Balashov\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n23\n\nmentioned that the only extant evidence of an authoritative decision prohibiting the use of the vernacular in the liturgy came from the 1918 Ukrainian council. The council resolved to retain Church Slavonic as the only language permissible for liturgy.74 Politics defined the arena of battle between the pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian cohorts at the 1918 council. As the history of the Ukrainian Church evolved in 1919 and beyond, liturgical language would come to symbolize the separation between the Ukrainian cohort and the synod of patriarchal bishops in Ukraine. Vlasovs’kyi disagreed with Metropolitan Vasyl Lypkivs’kyi’s assessment of the situation. Lypkivs’kyi wrote that the rebirth of the Ukrainian Church needed to come from the lower ranks, the laity, and not the upper ranks; Vlasovs’kyi argued that the creation of an authentically Ukrainian national hierarchy would have resolved the problem.75 Regardless of one’s position on this matter, it is clear that the role of the bishops was crucial in the changes in the ecclesial landscape that unfolded in Ukraine, and the attempt to redefine the role of the bishops in the administration of the Church would become the most complex feature of Ukrainian Orthodox religious identity and remain so to this day. Liturgical Language and the First Degree of Separation The fissures between the Ukrainian and Russian cohorts in Ukraine’s Orthodox Church deepened following the collapse of the Hetmanate and the establishment of Directory rule under Petliura in Ukraine. The Directory’s church agenda was established from the outset, as Metropolitan Antony and Archbishop Evlogy were arrested in December 1918 and sent to a Greek-Catholic monastery.76 The Directory also established a law on the superior administration of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which decreed that the Orthodox Church in Ukraine was autocephalous.77 The new decree maintained the traditional relationship between church and state familiar to Orthodox Christians in Ukraine. The law featured new elements representing the progressive cohorts in the Orthodox Church, including the creation of a synod consisting of two bishops, one archpriest, a priest, one deacon, three lay people, and one priest serving the military; the government appointment of one delegate who would participate in synodal meetings; the support of the synod through the government’s treasury; the independence of the Ukrainian Church from the patriarch of Moscow; and government confirmation of synodal decisions and proceedings. This illustration of a church that is essentially an organ of the Ukrainian state coheres with the political environment of the first years following the revolution. Vlasovs’kyi notes that the close relationship between church and state formulated by the Directory should not have been alarming since the Orthodox Church in Ukraine always had a formal relationship with the state.78 Furthermore, a similar situation\n\n24\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\noccurred in Russia, as the preconciliar preparations involved cooperative planning between church and state agents, and the Moscow Council itself enjoyed the support of the provisional government in Russia.79 The Directory understood the need for the Church to navigate the canonical process of legitimization among the other global Orthodox churches, so the government established a special mission to Istanbul led by Lotocky to obtain canonical autocephaly.80 The mission’s failure was partially attributable to the vacancy in the patriarchal cathedral of Constantinople, but was also influenced by the bewildering political scene in Ukraine. The Directory was in rapid decline, so the officials had to move their headquarters from Kyiv to Vinnytsia by February 2. From the December 1918 to December 1919, the Directory, the White Army, the Bolsheviks, the French entente, and the military serving the West Ukrainian Republic all had a hand in taking and evacuating Kyiv. Orest Subtelny describes the political scene as a series of military defeats, diplomatic disappointments, and ideological conflict among Ukrainians.81 Subtelny’s terse summary of the war for political hegemony in Ukraine is instructive for its analysis of Ukraine’s autocephalist movement: “by fall 1919, the situation of the Ukrainians was truly tragic . . . in Ukraine alone, the fighting, executions, and epidemics associated with the upheaval, especially the Civil War, took about 1.5 million lives.”82 The next phase of the development of Ukrainian public religious identity occurred under Soviet rule, where the rules of the relationship changed drastically due to the legislation of separation of church from state and the state’s assumption of control of Church property. The debate about language came to a head in this milieu, and the pro-Ukrainian cohort discovered new power in asserting its claim to ecclesial legitimacy. Following the disappointment and anger resulting from the 1918 conciliar decision to continue the privileging of Church Slavonic, the Ukrainians in 1919 cautiously reopened the matter of using the vernacular in liturgy. In March 1919, the reconstituted AUOCC appealed to Bishop Nazarii, the vicar of Kyiv eparchy in the absence of Metropolitan Antony, to permit the reading of the Gospel in vernacular Ukrainian for the Passion services and for Easter in the lesser church of Saint Sophia’s Cathedral in Kyiv. Bishop Nazarii denied the council’s request, and the council decided to register a Ukrainian parish with the Soviet government, a decision that hastened the process of separation between the Ukrainian cohort and the bishops.83 The Ukrainians’ ability to manipulate the Soviet policy of separation of church from state was the result of the transfer of power from the synod to the local parish, a process that had started before the revolution with the demands for ecclesial decentralization, democratization, and opportunities for parish clergy to receive more power within the Church.84 In the early Soviet period, the state essentially rendered eparchial bishops impotent in parish\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n25\n\nadministration.85 Gregory Freeze observes that power transferred “from prelate to parishioner.”86 The bishops had no real power to resist the Soviet transfer of a parish to the Ukrainian cohort, and this move would contribute to the destabilization of the episcopate itself. The decision to register a Ukrainian parish with the Soviet authorities led to the Ukrainian cohort receiving St. Nicholas Cathedral in the Pechersk district as their parish. The council again requested Bishop Nazarii’s blessing to serve the liturgy in Ukrainian, and he responded by permitting them to read the Gospel in Ukrainian with the rest of the service sung in Slavonic.87 On May 9, 1919, the Ukrainians celebrated the first ever liturgy with select elements in Ukrainian, with the music composed by the renowned Mykola Leontovich who directed the choir himself.88 This inaugural Ukrainian-language liturgy resulted in a domino effect, with Ukrainians in Kyiv receiving permission to use churches for worship from the Soviet government. Ukrainian-language parishes were organized outside of Kyiv as well. Soon afterward, on July 10, the entire liturgy was celebrated in vernacular Ukrainian at St. Sophia’s Cathedral; the cohort invited Bishop Nazarii to celebrate the liturgy, but he declined. A brief reflection on the process employed by the Ukrainian cohort to accomplish their objectives is worthwhile. Vlasovs’kyi’s historical review is apologetic, as he depicts the Ukrainian council as desiring to maintain a relationship with the episcopacy. He also mentions that Bishop Nazarii was irritated by the invitation and repeated petitions for Ukrainian-language services. The bishop’s consternation is understandable.89 The Ukrainian cohort had gained the upper hand in its battle with the synod by exercising the new and temporary freedom to register parishes that were no longer controlled by the Church. While the cohort petitioned Bishop Nazarii, they had also formed communities gathered around a common cause, the use of Ukrainian in the liturgy, on their own. The process was irregular, as the bishop was petitioned to bless gatherings that were already affirmed by the state. Furthermore, the bishop was challenged by a situation in which he had very little power, given that the state’s attempt to render bishops impotent resulted in the transfer of power from the bishops to the laity. The bishop’s initial blessing for some Ukrainian to be used at the first liturgy was reluctant, and represented a coerced adjustment to an increasingly impotent episcopacy that had no official place as an organ of the state. This episode also betrays a deeper and irreconcilable collision of ideologies. The bishop viewed the use of vernacular Ukrainian as a violation of the decree of the 1918 council. The Ukrainian cohort viewed the prohibition of vernacular Ukrainian as a violation of Orthodox tradition traceable to Saints Cyril and Methodius, whose translation of the liturgical Gospels and texts from Greek to Slavonic affirmed the evangelical value of the primacy of local language.90\n\n26\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nThe matter of liturgical language and the new separation of church and state resulted in an unprecedented conflict that gave the Ukrainian cohort temporary power. As the Ukrainians continued to form communities in and around Kyiv that used Ukrainian for the liturgy, the conflict with the bishops deepened on the ideological lines of ecclesial authority and the legitimacy of ethnic language. The political situation resulted in the temporary return of Metropolitan Antony to Kyiv in the late summer of 1919, facilitated by the brief occupation of the city by the White Army.91 During his brief return to the city, Antony suspended all of the clergy of the Ukrainian cohort who had promoted the celebration of the liturgy in Ukrainian from liturgical ministry. By the time the Soviets had established power, Antony had fled Ukraine, and Patriarch Tikhon replaced him with Metropolitan Michael (Ermakov). The suspended pro-Ukrainian clergy were deposed from the ranks of the clergy altogether in 1921.92 Thus, the matter was not merely one of liturgical language. The debate over liturgical language between the Ukrainian and Russian cohorts increased in vitriol, with each side employing the power at its disposal. The Ukrainian cohorts continued to establish Ukrainian-language parishes, whereas the Russian bishops canonically disposed of the primary clerical figures of the Ukrainian cohort. The power struggle over liturgical language continued, but a new issue rose to prominence alongside language: the limits of episcopal power in the Orthodox Church. Several related episodes demonstrate how the use of vernacular Ukrainian for the liturgy became one of the primary features of public religious identity for the Ukrainian cohort. Their disagreement with the bishops on language became so intense that the Ukrainians used their advocacy of the vernacular to seek ecclesial autocephaly instead of autonomy. In addition to the seminal events surveyed above, episodes and documents from the October Council of 1921 testify to the increasing prominence the Ukrainian language attained in the autocephaly movement of the Ukrainian cohort.\n\nThe Ukrainian Language at the October Council of 1921 Language and the Liturgy, 1919–1921 The October 1921 council was a permanent turning point in the history of Ukrainian Orthodox religious identity because it marked a determined separation from the Moscow Patriarchate and established a new course for Orthodoxy in Ukraine that is one of the sources of the current divisions within the Church. The residual divisions within the Orthodox Church serve as a reminder that not all bishops, clergy, and laity joined the movement for an autocephalous Orthodox Church that was distinctly Ukrainian.\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n27\n\nIn order to assess the October 1921 council, a review of crucial events in the interim period is necessary. Returning to 1919, during the heat of the battles between the pro-Ukrainian cohort and the episcopate in Kyiv, a second manifestation of the AUOCC convened.93 This council was similar to the original gathering that was interrupted by the war, but it had a slightly different trajectory. The group originated from the pro-Ukrainian cohort itself, the one that was organizing Ukrainian parishes distinct from the synod in Kyiv. The group consisted of thirty people and took on the name of the AUOCC with a new purpose, to be the superior governing organ for the organization of Ukrainian parishes.94 The AUOCC elected Michael Moroz as its chair, a close friend to Lypkivs’kyi. Vlasovs’kyi raises the relevant problem of representation; how could the group call itself “all-Ukrainian” when it was a tight-knit cohort of Ukrainianizing clergy and laity who sought separation from Moscow?95 Vlasovs’kyi paraphrases Lypkivs’kyi’s analysis of the AUOCC’s charter: “her ultimate goal is the creation of Ukrainian parishes, the rebirth of the Ukrainian Church throughout all Ukraine; she regards herself only as a temporary superior church organ of the Ukrainian Church up until the convocation of an authentic all-Ukrainian church council with representatives from Ukrainian parishes.”96 The AUOCC was the core group of leaders that pushed the agenda of establishing Ukrainian parishes in spite of episcopal resistance in Kyiv, and was the essential ecclesial cell that ultimately grew into the first autocephalous church of Ukraine. In other words, the AUOCC consisted of the people who promulgated the ideology that eventually resulted in the first autocephalous Ukrainian Church. The AUOCC came into conflict with the Orthodox synod in Kyiv by creating parishes without episcopal blessing. Vlasovs’kyi writes of an episode concerning the delegation of rights to parishes in Kyiv that reveals the perception of an emerging religious identity in both the pro- and anti-Ukrainian delegations.97 The context is the first Ukrainian-language liturgy celebrated on May 9, 1919, at St. Nicholas Cathedral in the Pechersk district.98 According to Vlasovs’kyi, over one thousand Ukrainians registered for membership in the first Ukrainian parish. Many others sought to establish St. Andrew’s Cathedral as another Ukrainian parish, an episode that led Bishop Nazarii and his clerical supporters to distinguish the “Ukrainians” from the “Orthodox.”99 While this episode is consistent with the evidence presented on the matter of language, it exposes the beginnings of a public juxtaposition of religious identity on the part of the synod in Ukraine. The local clergy and laity were given the choice of remaining Orthodox or joining the Ukrainians. The inscription of non-Orthodox identity upon the people of the AUOCC was not merely a matter of language, but primarily a convenient way of distinguishing the proper, canonical manner of resolving disputes. In this scheme, the Orthodox way would approach the dispute within the church with the involvement of the bishop. The\n\n28\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nAUOCC’s establishment of Ukrainian-language parishes with direct appeal to the local authorities circumvented the canonical process. As polemics permeated the inscription of religious identity and deepened the separation between the cohorts, the legitimacy of praying in the vernacular was undermined. Tetiana Ievsieieva explains the ideology of the Russian bishops in Ukraine during this period by stating that many Orthodox eparchies of the Russian empire were essentially polynational with non-Russian majorities.100 Because of the fusion of the Orthodox Church and state established during the imperial period, the bishops represented both the Church and the state’s elite. Ievsieieva asserts that the Church periodicals of the period aligned nationalism with the heresy of ethnophyletism, the capitulation to secularism, and a betrayal of the catholic nature of the Church.101 She states that it was practically impossible for someone with nationalistic sympathies to become a candidate for the office of bishop.102 Clergy and bishops who expressed any kind of patriotism other than the promotion of Great Russian identity were deemed “uncanonical.”103 Ievsieieva’s observation on the ideology of multinational unity held together by the Russian church as an organ of the state explains how the Russian bishops came to dominate church leadership in Ukraine, and how they came into conflict with the AUOCC. The close alignment of the Church as a multinational constituency with Orthodox canonicity is also noteworthy for its early appearance as a staple feature of the religious identity of the patriarchal church in Ukraine. The AUOCC, encouraged by the popular response, continued to establish Ukrainian parishes and broadened its reach outside of Kyiv.104 The conflict between the two sides was exacerbated, leading to Bishop Nazarii’s decision to suspend the Ukrainian clergy from the right to officiate at divine services on April 17, 1920.105 At this point, the conflict between the AUOCC and the bishops was irreconcilable. In a letter to the Orthodox community of Ukraine of May 5, 1920, the AUOCC declared Bishop Nazarii’s canonical suspension of the Ukrainian clergy to be immoral and uncanonical.106 The AUOCC established a permanent path of separation by appealing for the creation of a Ukrainian episcopate for Ukrainian parishes.107 It is also noteworthy that the AUOCC identified the new Ukrainian church as autocephalous and ruled by sobornopravnist’ (conciliar governance). As the process of separation continued and the AUOCC solidified its plans to create an autocephalous body in Ukraine, an important figure emerged: Archbishop Parfenii (Levitsky), who was overseeing the eparchy of Poltava. Archbishop Parfenii was sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause, and the AUOCC believed that he had agreed to be their new primate.108 The Ukrainian cohort commemorated him as “archbishop of Ukraine” in the liturgy. But the AUOCC had mistaken Parfenii’s sympathy for a full commitment to separation from the patriarchate. The synod of bishops in Ukraine admonished Parfenii for encouraging\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n29\n\nthe autocephalists in a resolution from their meeting on March 3, 1921; the synod asserted that Parfenii was leading clergy and laity astray by permitting this commemoration and instructed him to communicate via letter his promise to cease interfering in the canonical affairs of other eparchies.109 In a letter written to Patriarch Tikhon on December 31, 1920, Parfenii explained the Ukrainian cohort’s frustration with the inconsistent application of the canonical permission to pray in Ukrainian granted in 1918 and admitted that they had commemorated him liturgically. Parfenii asked Patriarch Tikhon to bless him or another bishop to care for the Ukrainians for the sake of peace in the Church. In his letter, Parfenii also testified to the Ukrainian cohort’s search for an episcopal supporter outside of Ukraine, which included trips to Istanbul and Georgia.110 Parfenii eventually acquiesced to the demands of the synod in Ukraine that he cease association with the AUOCC, and the fissures between the two groups deepened, especially after the synod deposed all of the Ukrainian clergy from holy orders in February 1921. Parfenii ultimately declined the Ukrainian cohort’s invitation to preside at their council on account of poor health and travel time. The Ukrainian cohort was reluctant to invite other bishops on account of their refusal to grant or proclaim autocephaly, and had already experienced the disappointment of a lack of action on the part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This series of events led up to the AUOCC’s first council held on May 22–26, 1921, in Kyiv.111 This was a council of the Ukrainian churches of Kyiv and was essentially a preparatory meeting for the October Council.112 The May Council’s declarations functioned as foundations for the October Council and thus represented the Ukrainian cohort’s distinct ideology. Among the most significant decisions of the May gathering was its election of Archbishop Parfenii as metropolitan of Kyiv and its strong disavowal of the existing synod in Ukraine.113 Parfenii, however, did not attend the council and ceased his association with the AUOCC, which left it and its rapidly increasing roster of parishes without an episcopal patron. Vlasovs’kyi concluded that Parfenii was not to blame for his failure to appear at the council and preside over it, given his patronage of the Ukrainian movement in general. Concerning the errors of the May gathering, Prelovs’ka is likely correct in stating that the error of the leaders of the AUOCC was in appointing bishops who had “communicated their support for the rebirth of the Church in Ukraine in correspondence, but did not offer any guarantees.”114 The remainder of this section will analyze the October 1921 council of the Ukrainian Church since this marks the establishment of a new hierarchy and the final separation of the Ukrainian Church from the standing Orthodox synod and the MP. The proceedings of the council and its acts and resolutions are the primary texts expressing its identity. In some instances, the resolutions from the May 1921 meeting in Kyiv also amplify points of religious identity.\n\n30\n\nCH A P T E R 1\n\nThe May 1921 Preparatory Council The series of events that resulted in the establishment of Ukrainian-language parishes in Kyiv and other select regions of Ukraine influenced the work of the council and its final attempts to reconcile with the Orthodox episcopate in Ukraine. The appeal of Patriarch Tikhon to the faithful in Ukraine (July 23, 1921) to preserve the unity of the Church coalesces around the problem of liturgical language.115 The patriarch identified the cause of division among Orthodox in Ukraine at the very beginning of his letter: Enemies of the long-standing unity of Orthodox Ukrainians with the entire Russian Church have produced discord and enmity among members of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and are said to be in violation of Church discipline, and have voluntarily introduced services in the Ukrainian language in several parishes with aggression.116\n\nThe patriarch referred to a concession made by the Ukrainian synod in its meeting on February 12–15 of 1921, which permitted the possibility of celebrating the services in Ukrainian parishes with Ukrainian pronunciation of Church Slavonic, the reading of the Gospel in Ukrainian (following the Church Slavonic reading), and the preaching of the homily in Ukrainian, as long as the faithful indicate their desire for the vernacular.117 The patriarch argued that the synod responded affirmatively to the desire of the Ukrainian cohort for increased Ukrainization of church life. He asserted that bishops would protect beloved Ukrainian traditions from falling into decay and promised to create a special committee to translate the Bible and liturgical books from Church Slavonic into vernacular Ukrainian.118 Furthermore, the patriarchal church would permit parishes to celebrate liturgy in Ukrainian if two-thirds of the parish membership voted for it.119 It is notable that the patriarch appointed Archbishop Michael (Ermakov) to the seat of metropolitan of Kyiv in the same letter, referring to the request of the synod of bishops from their meeting on May 19–20, 1921, and the Kyivan union of parish churches.120 The patriarch asked the Ukrainian faithful to accept Metropolitan Michael with love, and expressed hope that these decisions would end the internal enmity and division among the faithful. The patriarch’s letter was quite conciliatory in tone and suggested that the patriarchate was ready to respond affirmatively to the Ukrainian cohort’s desire for ecclesial Ukrainization. The patriarch’s letter, though, was issued only nine days following a stern rebuke issued by the synod of bishops in Kyiv to the Ukrainian faithful. In their letter of July 14, 1921, the bishops attempted to delegitimize the meeting held by the Ukrainian cohort in May of 1921.121 The bishops depicted the activity of the Ukrainian cohort as canonically dubious, arguing that a gathering\n\nTe irst utocephalist\n\novement and the reation oo the U O\n\n(1(17(1930\n\n31\n\nof laity, deacons and presbyters, without the knowledge and blessing of the synod of bishops, was a violation of Apostolic Canon 29, which prohibits clergy and laity from doing anything without the permission of the bishop.122 The synod instructed the faithful to use the proper liturgical commemorations at divine services, including an admonition to include a commemoration of “His Holiness Our Father Patriarch Tikhon.”123 The letter also referred implicitly to the deposition from sacred orders of priests and deacons who belonged to the Ukrainian cohort and had participated in the May gathering in Kyiv, reminding the faithful that “those who are deposed from orders and priests who are suspended from liturgical service are not permitted to perform any church services or sacraments, and that celebrating them does not yield any gracious power.”124 The messages communicated by the synod of Ukrainian bishops and Patriarch Tikhon to the faithful in Ukraine were mixed. On the one hand, they depicted the activity of the Ukrainian cohort as illegitimate, in violation of ancient canons and recent conciliar directives. Any association with clergy who were under ecclesiastical interdict on account of their canonical violations would deprive faithful of access to divine grace. On the other hand, the tone is conciliatory. The patriarch wanted to avoid the spread of discord and schism, and was willing to permit the Ukrainization of the Church in accordance with the will of the local laity. The patriarch’s prim"
