The articles included in this book were conceived in an academic context and atmosphere in the best sense, where the analysis of concepts, together with efforts to understand, and possibly reconcile, various viewpoints and approaches is ultimately supposed to contribute to the bridging of gaps and elimination of prejudices. Our Ukrainian colleagues readily joined us in this effort. The war launched on Ukraine by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, has brought cardinal changes to the original context and atmosphere. The voices of some Orthodox leaders have tried to justify this war, or even to endow it with pseudo-religious meaning and motives. But this war is simply a crime. A crime cannot have any hidden or overt religious justification, and there is little, if any, possibility for dialogue, academic or otherwise, between scholars of Christianity committed to peace and those misusing Christian teaching for the justification of an aggressive war, which violates all standards of international law established for decades. Here too, then, is new a fault line in Orthodoxy, which already has been noticed with concern. The war, and its repercussions among the churches, will display, and already have displayed, their effects in world Orthodoxy. The fault line addressed in our volume is another one. There can be, and hopefully will be in new circumstances, a dialogue between adherents of different theological or historiographical concepts of whatever label and categorization, be that “liberal,” “traditional,” “conservative,” or something else. This dialogue can take place once it is clear that it is supposed to happen on the ground of shared basic ethics and scholarly convictions and principles. Among the most important of them are mutual respect and the condemnation of violence. At this moment, we can only hope that the articles in this volume retain their value for future encounters and exchange of thoughts, in a safe, recovered, and flourishing Ukraine, and beyond. The idea for this book arose shortly before summer 2020. We would like to express our gratitude to all our authors for reacting promptly to our requests, for submitting their excellent contributions, and keeping the occasionally short-term deadlines. We also must express our thanks to the student assistants of the Ecumenical Institute, University of Münster, and to Dr. Sebastian Rimestad, Weimar, for their valuable help with the formal corrections and the formatting of the manuscript.\n\n10\n\nThomas Bremer, Alfons Brüning, Nadieszda Kizenko\n\nFinally, we are indebted to Prof. Vasilios N. Makrides, Chair of Religious Studies (Orthodox Christianity) at the University of Erfurt, for his readiness to include our manuscript in this book series.

The Conflict in Ukraine as Expression of a Fault Line in World Orthodoxy Thomas Bremer, Alfons Brüning, Nadieszda Kizenko The conflict around the emergence of a Ukrainian autocephalous church, from summer 2018 onwards, has led to a split in world Orthodoxy into two main camps. One camp is represented by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which edited the tomos, the deed granting autocephaly and includes three more autocephalous churches which have recognized this act. The other is the Patriarchate of Moscow, which severely opposed the new ecclesial structure in Ukraine and regards it as schismatic. Some churches have made statements supporting Moscow’s position, others keep by now a neutral position. Although Ukraine is the focus and the cause of this conflict, the argument has exposed deeper fault lines within world Orthodoxy. Many of them are not purely theological by nature. Beyond dogmatic or ecclesiological issues, these fault lines pertain to questions such as church and state, church and society, social ethics, secular historical narratives or the use of history respectively. Such fault lines are not exclusive to Ukraine, despite displaying some Ukrainian peculiarities, different from other regions which have their own. These fault lines need to be identified and addressed; otherwise, the Ukrainian issue cannot be solved but remains on the level of a factual argument. In its reaction, Moscow broke sacramental communion with the See of Constantinople and prohibited its believers from receiving the sacraments from the other side; after three more Orthodox churches recognized the autocephalous Church in Ukraine in 2019 and 2020,1 Moscow reacted in the same way. Constantinople refrained from responding in equal terms, and still allows its believers to join services in the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and to take the sacraments there. The Patriarch of Moscow does not commemorate the first hierarchs of those four churches anymore, whereas they do commemorate him when they celebrate liturgy. Nonetheless, in administrative and ecclesiastical terms the split is a manifest reality. On the other hand, the particularities of the Orthodox ecclesiastical landscape allow for inconsistency in dealing with this general rupture. Some of the autocephalous Orthodox churches have disapproved of the new Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) and joined the Russian Church in its rejection of the autocephaly, 1\n\nThe Church of Greece, the Patriarchate of Alexandria, and the Church of Cyprus.\n\n12\n\nThomas Bremer, Alfons Brüning, Nadieszda Kizenko\n\nthough not breaking communion with the churches that have recognized the new Church.2 In other cases, local synods have issued cautious statements attempting to keep some kind of neutrality; others yet have attempted to seek a solution. This leads to an odd phenomenon. At the local level, communion often continues between members of churches which have officially positioned themselves in favor of, or against the OCU, and therefore joined opposite camps—while at the level of the patriarchates almost all contacts have ceased. Most churches are in communion with both Constantinople and Moscow even though these two are not in communion among themselves. Therefore, the split—already often called a schism—concerns not only Orthodoxy in Ukraine but runs through the entirety of Orthodox Christianity. And the reason for it is not just a concrete act or the rejection of it, namely granting autocephaly to the OCU or denying it, but rather the fact that there is different perceptions and positions in central issues within Orthodoxy which have not been addressed. Thus, the current situation is not a complete surprise. The argument is not only about whether there can be a Ukrainian autocephalous church, and who is entitled the right to grant this (or any) autocephaly. It is also about what the features of such a church are supposed to be in the world of the 21st century,3 and where it would position itself, or, more generally, what the features of Orthodoxy are supposed to be. The very question of autocephaly is not new for the Orthodox world. It has a different nature in the early 21st century than it had in antiquity, or in the 15th century, or during the 19th century, when so many of today’s national churches gained theirs. Exploring circumstances in terms of (geo-)political developments and societal situation, historical experience and its current articulation and the like, which accompany the emergence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and its search for a place in both the Orthodox world and Ukrainian society, is among the aims of this volume. Observers of the current developments have repeatedly noted that, despite multiple historical experiences, Orthodoxy to date does not have clear-cut and commonly accepted canonical pathways towards autocephaly.4 The paths towards ecclesial independence were largely conditioned by the respective historical circumstances. The fact that most churches which became autocephalous after antiquity have prior to that been a part of the Ecumenical 2 3 4\n\nAbove all, the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Polish Orthodox Church. For an outline of the general background, see Victor Roudometof, Globalization and Orthodox Christianity: The Transformations of a Religious Tradition (New York: Routledge, 2014). The issue is discussed in great length in: Autocephaly: In Search of Unity in Diversity, ed. Edward G. Farrugia and Željko Paša (Rome, forthcoming). For an outline of historical examples for autocephaly previous to the Ukrainian case, see Paul Brusanowski, “Autocephaly in Ukraine: The Canonical Dimension,” in Churches in the Ukrainian Crisis, ed. Andrii Krawchuk, Thomas Bremer (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), 47–78.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nPatriarchate, which therefore was the first in the canonical order and the “mother church” at the same time, makes it even more difficult to develop a theory of gaining and granting autocephaly. So does the fact that several autocephalies were granted twice, by different churches, due mostly to changed political circumstances. The current conflict, far from representing just a single jurisdictional disagreement concerning a locally and thematically limited issue, illustrates also more general differences which have their repercussions in other parts of the Orthodox community in the conditions of a globalized world. Indeed, they may relate to problems relevant not only for Orthodoxy, but for World Christianity as a whole. The relationship between the local church and the respective worldwide community is an issue that does not concern only Orthodoxy but also other churches. Here, the question is relevant what “church unity” means. The Ukrainian case shows that the claim to be one in faith is not enough for keeping a community together. The tensions between the different schools of thought were apparent already earlier. The 2016 “Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church” on Crete, the long road which had led to that event, the eventual absence of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and of three other churches, made the differences in the Orthodox world obvious. The conflict about the Ukrainian autocephaly, therefore, is strangely autocatalytic; it is one, and perhaps just another, concrete manifestation of large-scale virulent Orthodox Christian disagreements, while its outbreak reinforces already existing differences, which could not be healed before. This larger perspective is essential to adequately address the Ukrainian case. The Ukrainian conflict is unlikely to be solved unless controversial issues are understood and addressed on a more general level. While it is still basically true that the different Orthodox churches inside Ukraine and elsewhere continue to agree in all central theological questions and principles, such as apostolic tradition, dogma, liturgy, mysteries, and the like, the Orthodox community is now nonetheless threatened by a real and lasting division. Stating this paradox makes clear that the controversial issues which are in the background can also not be reduced to “external” matters or mere questions of “politics” which would leave the allegedly pure and untouched sphere of faith and theology undisturbed. It is still ultimately theological issues which are currently at stake. Beyond just outward events and local confrontations, the conflict touches upon matters central for the role and position of Orthodox Christianity in the world of the 21st century. Among those central problems are ecclesiology in a global age, the relation to “the secular world,” human rights and Christian morality, church and state, and church and civil society. Much has to do with the way in which the modern, globalized, pluralistic world is being perceived, understood, and conceptualized. A larger part of Orthodox Christianity in the European East still struggles to overcome the shadows of the Communist past, experiencing the\n\n14\n\nThomas Bremer, Alfons Brüning, Nadieszda Kizenko\n\nchallenges of the post-communist era. Others perceive current developments more as a challenge in a secular, perhaps even post-secular age, when roles and positions of religion in society and politics are generally being redefined. The latter position can frequently be seen among Orthodox who live in Western, traditionally non-Orthodox countries. These two perspectives on occasion interact and can appear in quaint combinations. Perhaps, as some of the articles of this volume show, this is also the case in current day Ukraine, among others. Certainly, there is no clear understanding what “secular” means, and that (and how) it needs to be distinguished from “secularism.” Dealing with these challenges, on the other hand, provokes to reflect in a new way on “tradition.” For Orthodox Christianity in particular, the role of (Christian) tradition has always been a main point of reflection, with the important distinction between “Tradition” and “traditions” on the one hand, and a new predilection for “traditional values” in some churches on the other hand. Ecclesiology has been a central issue in 20th century ecumenical dialogues, but mostly in terms of apostolic succession, the relationship between ministry and the community, and the relationship between synodality and primacy. Orthodoxy has stated its position in these questions clearly. The actual shape of the Christian Church, however—what it actually looks like, and what it should look like—is obviously an issue for internal Orthodox disputes under the conditions of modernity, which is under-addressed. Modernity, on the other hand, brings about themes like church and state, church and nation, church and society, which are not part of “classical” ecclesiology, but stand in the background of modern realities. Among the terms engaged to come to a feasible concept are such like canonical territory, or civilization, next to episcopal, synodal, or lay-centered approaches. There have already been controversies concerning such themes and problems throughout the entire Orthodox community for some time, mostly among theologians, but also among church leaders. It is perhaps important to emphasize that the whole spectrum of current positions is present in all churches and often runs contrary to such outward divisions as that between Moscow and Constantinople. There is not one simple fault line between two camps. We deal rather with blurred boundaries and flexible transitions between a variety of positions. It is not a question of this or that autocephalous church, it is a question of positions within Orthodoxy. So what we have to deal with is the question of local and global Orthodoxy, the conceptualizations of the questions, the concrete forms of ecclesiology which are an expression of the different positions, and the relationship to secular structures, i.e. to the state and to society. These deliberations form the framework for this volume, which is accordingly structured in four parts. It does not intend to “resolve” the problem, or to decide who is “right” and who is “wrong.” It rather aims at shedding more light on the general differences and larger dimensions of disagreement behind the Ukrainian conflict, which, as said before, appears as both\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nexpression and reinforcement of already existing controversies. While Ukraine therefore forms a central subject of this volume, it is not the only one. There is an obvious need to go a step further. In addressing the conflict concerning Ukrainian autocephaly and the emergence of the OCU, one by now can already rely upon a number of studies thoroughly describing the chain of events leading to the current situation, or various contributions outlining the argumentation of each side.5 Our volume therefore also does not want to narrate well-known events and stories once again. In order to achieve this goal, we will firstly have a glance at questions of general character. On the global level, John H. Erickson discusses the question of the territorial structure of the Orthodox Church. He does that in a historical perspective which reveals that the idea of “territory” is the central ecclesiological issue. He also shows that for Orthodox Christians, attachment to by-gone empires and imperial structures may have limited their field of vision and their capacity for adaptation in a post-imperial world. Finally, he offers suggestions for moving beyond the present de facto schism between the churches. Addressing both questions of ecclesiology and historical memory, Vera Tchentsova deals with the divergent interpretations of the events in 1686, which eventually ended in a transfer of jurisdiction over the Kyiv Church from Constantinople to Moscow. The crucial point stands in the appropriate understanding of the procedure of liturgical commemorations of patriarchs as explained in the documents of 1686. Addressing this specific point in historiography offers the opportunity to follow and assess the evolving views on the transfer of the diocese of Kyiv from the 19th century till the current political debate and to identify the scholarly rationale at play behind the today’s divergent historical narratives. The second part of this volume addresses the theological concepts, which lie behind the divergent positions. A first competition of concepts concerns the relatively new field of Orthodox social ethics. The Russian Orthodox Church has published in 2000 a document on social ethics, and the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed in 2020. Heta Hurskainen discusses both documents in a comparative perspective and analyzes how Orthodoxy approaches the challenges of our time in very different ways, which is connected to theological presuppositions that can be found in the two Churches. How questions of social ethics are discussed in Ukraine today, beyond the relationship between state and church, is the topic Regina Elsner addresses which presents in a certain way a concretization of the respective documents. The country is characterized by the emergence of a vibrant civil society since the 1990s, a context of confessional pluralism, and a search for identity between pro-European and pro-Russian tendencies, which has generated 5\n\nFor the pre-2018 development, see Churches in the Ukrainian Crisis, ed.

Her paper examines the socioethical engagement of Ukraine’s Orthodox churches and the impact of local actors since the country’s independence. Next to divergent interpretations of particular historical events—like the Union of Brest or the change of jurisdiction from Constantinople to Moscow in 1686 (as analyzed in the mentioned contribution by Vera Tchentsova)—Ukraine has become, or always been, an arena for competing grand narratives, in which Orthodox Christianity plays a central role. Some years ago, the Russian government and the Orthodox Church alike promoted the idea of a “Russian World” (Russkii Mir), a kind of civilizational understanding of the world. Kathy Rousselet in her contribution explores the different steps in the development of this concept, its function between religious identity and geopolitical application, and its current role. Although the concept in church circles has suffered a certain setback in connection with the annexation of Crimea through the Russian state, and has rarely been referred to since then by Russian hierarchs, it is, according to Rousselet, far from obsolete. It still retains the function of identifying a Russian cultural sphere, which goes far beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as a state, and can be compared to other—notably, post-colonial—concepts like the Commonwealth or the French francophonie. Alfons Brüning investigates a kind of alternative concept, namely the idea of a “Kyivan Christianity,” which has evolved over the last decades by a subsequent merger of earlier Greek Catholic (“Churches of the Kyivan tradition”) and Orthodox diaspora concepts. However, just like ancient ideas of “Holy Russia,” the imagination of a distinct face of Christian religion in the Kyivan lands has a longer pre-history, and is currently adjusted to modern needs. Perhaps similar to the “Russian World,” the concept operates with several basic patterns, but beyond that is a matter of discourse rather than offering clear-cut definitions in every respect. Also the narrative of a distinctive Ukrainian, “Kyivan” form of Christian religion over time has changed its accents and dissociative potential. Whereas in former periods dissociation from Poland and Roman Catholicism often played a dominant role, in current debates the emphasis on distinctiveness from Russian narratives is clearly prevailing. In its third part, this collection of papers deals with the theological side of the problem. Given that in theology (in the narrower sense) there are no differences between the churches involved, it is mostly on ecclesiology. Here, too, the churches have slightly different approaches. Nicholas Denysenko analyzes the significance of synodality in Ukrainian Orthodoxy which has its beginnings much earlier than in the 1990s, namely in the autocephaly movement in the early 1920s. He describes the development of the synodal idea throughout Ukrainian history and reflects of the possible significance of synodality for Ukrainian Orthodoxy in the future. The global level of synodality is addressed by Ioan Moga. He first discusses the concrete application of synodality on the basis of statutes in several autocephalous churches of mechanisms of conflict regulations. In a second step,\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nhe opens the perspective of a “theology of synodality” which would understand synodality as a communicative event. The events in Ukraine ask the question about unity—what does it mean, how can it be achieved? Evgeny Pilipenko brings the issue of church unity into the broader theological context within the Orthodox tradition based on the biblical Revelation. In modernity, the idea of unity has been refracted in the theological quest; so he discusses the systematic coverage of the most important principles by Orthodox theologians and presents the perspectives that have been outlined for ecclesial thought and practice. An important aspect in which the church unity becomes concrete is liturgy. The Orthodox churches in Ukraine already have in some regard different liturgical uses. Nadieszda Kizenko researches how the OCU changed liturgical elements, above all by dropping those who refer to Russia, and thus displayed her loyalty to the Ukrainian cause—therefore one cannot speak of a proper liturgical reform but rather of an adaption. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) mostly sticks to the conventional use as it does not see liturgy as the main field to express church allegiance. The situation of two churches in the country also leads to the question of exclusivism which is discussed by Sergii Bortnyk. His article addresses a multi-layered problem. Exclusivism can rely to the issue of salvation—is there salvation only in a concrete church, or can it be attained also without belonging to this church? But exclusivism, once more, does not have only theological implications and consequences. It can also refer to the position of a church in society, and its relationship to the state. Bortnyk’s contribution, therefore, also analyzes the respective documents of the Orthodox churches in Ukraine and also statistical data from 1989 to the present day. Exclusivism, furthermore, also pertains to historical memory, insofar as a fundamentally different attitude of the UOC and the OCU (or its predecessors) to many historical events can be observed. Tetiana Kalenychenko and Lidiya Lozova deal with the question of what the role of laypeople in both churches in Ukraine is. In the end, it is the “normal” believers, who will make the decision of which parish to attend and with which church to affiliate. The concrete experience on the ground shows that there is a broad range of approaches, like people who are Orthodox but refuse to identify with one of the churches, or initiatives for dialogue between members of the churches. Thomas Bremer discusses in his article possible ecclesiological consequences of the Ukrainian case, above all the question whether the territorial principle which is common for both the Orthodox and the Catholic churches can offer a solution for such cases. He proposes to consider a shift in the ecclesiological paradigm which would enable two churches in communion with each other to exercise jurisdiction over the same territory. Pavlo Smytsnyuk addresses the ecumenical dimensions of the establishment of the OCU, starting with the mostly positive reaction by the other Ukrainian churches. On the international level, the new situation has consequences for bilateral ecumenical dialogues (above all that\n\n18\n\nThomas Bremer, Alfons Brüning, Nadieszda Kizenko\n\nbetween the Orthodox and the Catholic churches), but also for the multilateral ecumenical organizations like the World Council of Churches. It is to be seen whether the current crisis will become an opportunity for ecumenical dialogue, or, on the contrary, a source of further tension. The fourth and last part addresses issues of church, state, and society in Orthodoxy. Here, too, one can distinguish at least two fundamental approaches, namely whether the Church is a part of the society, or rather stands vis-a-vis society. Elena Stepanova analyzes the ROC’s engagement in the sphere of morality in which a distinctiveness of the Russian culture and religion in comparison with Western countries is underlined. In the end, the relevant debates demonstrate the opposition of two basic strategies: interpreting morality as a set of rigid propositions (authorized by either religious or secular powers), to which an individual has to subordinate through their unchallenged recognition, or the right of a person for autonomous moral choice, as well as bearing responsibility for it. Different from what the guiding narrative of the Russian Orthodox Church and its “traditional values” discourse would suggest, also contemporary Russian society offers numerous examples for both approaches, presenting an image rather of “multiple moralities.” Aristotle Papanikolaou offers an analysis of the current situation and discusses the relationship of Orthodoxy to democracy. He shows that the rejection of pluralism is a typical feature for Orthodox churches in the post-communist world, and develops a theological pattern for political engagement, drawing from the ascetic tradition of the Orthodox Church. Finally, Nathaniel Wood considers the role of the state in an Orthodox understanding of politics, by comparing the approaches of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the ROC, i.e. a “church with a state” and a “stateless” church. He shows how both churches have reimagined the notion of symphonia in competing ways in their respective contexts, and how they approach secularism, liberalism, and human rights. We have asked Adalberto Mainardi to read through the whole manuscript and to wrap up the baselines of the volume, and also to show where further research is needed, in a concluding chapter. This way, we hope to achieve the main goal of our book: its starting point is that the conflict cannot be solved without an appropriate understanding of its actual nature and its dimensions. Our volume has the— perhaps both humble and ambitious—aim to contribute to such a better understanding.\n\nI. Orthodoxy: Global and Local\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church: Historical and Canonical Background to a Current Crisis John H. Erickson To speak of “the territorial organization of the Orthodox Church” or of “canonical territory” raises questions about the meaning of several words. These include “territory” and its derivatives as well as related words that frequently are used in present-day inter-Orthodox discussion: place, topos, locus, local, pomestnyi [...] The etymologies and literal meaning of these words suggest a particular portion of physical space, generally a rather small portion, but such words can also be understood metaphorically, and their semantic range varies considerably from one language and culture to another. In any case, “territory” cannot be adequately defined simply by reference to lines drawn on a map. Only slightly less problematic is the word “canonical” and with it “uncanonical.” How are the ancient texts that form the canonical corpus common to all the Eastern Orthodox churches to be understood and applied today? Vague or contradictory appeals to “tradition,” to “the traditional interpretation” of this or that canon, or to “the traditional practice of the church” raise troublesome questions about the coherence and consistency of Orthodox tradition itself. Further questions arise about issues much debated in contemporary Orthodoxy. For example, what is the meaning of “autocephaly” or “diaspora”? And behind these questions lies an even more basic one: What do we mean by Church? Whether spatially or temporally, the Church confessed in our creeds is not reducible to its institutions and organizational structures. Beneath issues dividing Moscow and Constantinople today lie methodological problems that are endemic to the Eastern Orthodox but certainly not limited to them. We tend to look at history in the wrong way. We project our present preconceptions and preoccupations onto church life of the past. We construct stories, some more plausible than others, out of materials from the past in ways that help explain our present situation and that provide a vision—or at least an agenda—for the future. Such stories require sympathetic but critical attention. We should consider not only what they tell us but also what they fail to tell us. Today, unfortunately, the stories being told by Moscow and Constantinople portend a future of division. The de facto schism between them that arose over Ukraine has implications for all the Orthodox, whether in lands with universally recognized autocephalous or autonomous churches or in the so-called diaspora. At stake are not only inter-Orthodox relations at every level of church life but also wider issues of Christian unity, whether short term (e.g., common participation in ecumenical activities) or long term (e.g., closer ties with the Oriental Orthodox and Catholics).\n\n24\n\nJohn H. Erickson\n\nPostmodern critiques have drawn attention to methodological problems inherent in the study of history, including the history of the Church and its institutions. They note the temporality of both the historian and the past that the historian tries to capture. They are uneasy with efforts to distinguish the essential from the accidental, the permanent from the occasional, the inevitable from the contingent. Roman historian Raymond Van Dam captures the present mood with this startling demand: “One imposing requirement for interpreting the past is to forget the future. In hindsight the actual course of events may seem to have been a natural, almost inevitable, outcome […] But this sort of retrospective teleology thoroughly obscures the underlying contingency of past events and the fundamental uncertainty of our modern interpretations.”1 I take “fundamental uncertainty of our modern interpretations” to be an appeal for hermeneutical modesty. When attempting to interpret the past, neither historians nor theologians should pretend to omniscience. I take Van Dam’s reference to the “contingency of past events” as a reminder that “people in the past were living in their present, unaware of future outcomes.”2 The present of Christians in antiquity was quite different from our own. It was marked by considerably greater diversity whether in the articulation of doctrine, the structuring of church communities, the negotiation of social and cultural frontiers, or the quest for sanctity, whether in the ante-Nicene period or in the post-Nicene. Ecumenically inclined historians sometimes speak of the “undivided church of the first millennium.” There was no such thing. Even if we limit our purview to Constantinople and Rome and ill-advisedly refer to them as East and West, official hierarchical communion between these sees was broken for extended periods during the first millennium and, of course, beyond. At the same time, less hierarchically structured expressions of communion—pilgrimage to sacred sites, the cultus of the saints, pursuit of the religious life, even scholarly activity—continued to unite Christians in many ways. If we take own institutional present as the standard by which we measure and evaluate the past, as the goal toward which that past has inevitably led, we run the risk of overlooking possible charismatic pathways to reconciliation along the way. 1\n\n2\n\nRaymond Van Dam, The Roman Revolution of Constantine (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 9.

While coverage of political and intellectual background is not absent, this often is skewed in ways that obscure the present in which protagonists interacted and struggled. It obscures, first of all, how much major players in the controversies of the day had in common with each other. As Khaled Anatolios observes of the fourth-century trinitarian controversies, the protagonists “were all interacting within a common narrative, a common set of Christian experiences.”3 It also obscures the distance between the present in which they interacted and our own. For students of church history today, the theological world of early Christians has grown strangely unfamiliar. This poses a problem that is at once intellectual and spiritual. To accept or even to recognize the otherness of the past requires intellectual openness and spiritual humility. Diversity in Christian antiquity also characterized church order. Consider, for example, the institution of the chorepiscopos—the country bishop—in eastern Asia Minor, Syria and, with a slightly different articulation, in Gaul. Canon 6 of the Council of Sardica (343 AD) offers a clue to its eventual disappearance: “It is not permitted to ordain a bishop in a village or petty town, for which even a single presbyter is sufficient, lest the name and authority of bishop should be made of small account.”4 Quite different was the situation in Roman Africa, where nearly every village and town had its own bishop, who exercised full episcopal authority within a notably egalitarian collegial framework. Canonical norms against transfer of bishops from one see to another were rigorously enforced; chairmanship and speaking order at councils was determined by seniority of ordination rather than by prestige of one’s see.5 A similar situation obtained in Pontus.6 Different yet again was the situation in the Syriac east. The inclusive character of its worship, spirituality, and community life is beautifully illustrated in the festal verse homilies of Jacob of Sarug (d. 521 AD), who “identifies every member of the gathered church as crucial to, and fully participant in, the activity of liturgical celebration. Naming each group by gender, age, ethnicity, social location, and 3 4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nKhaled Anatolios, Retrieving Nicaea: The Development and Meaning of Trinitarian Doctrine (Grand Rapids MI: Baker Academic, 2011), 58.

Erickson\n\necclesiastical rank, Jacob effectively erases the lines between lay, monastic and ordained as liturgical celebrants.”7 Eventually the pattern that we are familiar with from accounts of turmoil during the trinitarian and christological controversies comes to prevail, at least within the Roman Empire. Ambitious prelates maneuver for appointment to prestigious sees or try to avoid appointment to insignificant ones. Transfers from one see to another—in principle “uncanonical”—become more common. Top-down hierarchical structures attempt to maintain good pastoral leadership by establishing workable processes for episcopal appointments and review. Generally speaking, these processes reflected the patronage system that characterized public life in the late Roman Empire. As Brian Daley points out, “to have been confirmed as a candidate for Church office and ordained by an important metropolitan, especially if the election process had been contentious, put both a bishop and his whole Church in that metropolitan’s debt.”8 Of course, patron-client relationships sometimes frayed or even broke down completely, as happened multiple times in the course of the christological controversies. Eventually, however, among both Catholics and Chalcedonian Orthodox, patronage comes to be officially regulated whether through legislation or traditional practice. The resultant hierarchical structures gave these churches a measure of stability and resilience that they maintained well into the 20th century, but we should not regard this as the only possible outcome—as natural, inevitable, and the only “canonical” way to structure church life. For most Christians in the first centuries of the Constantinian era, one aspect of their present did give the illusion of being eternal, and that was Rome and its empire. The last triumph in the Eternal City was celebrated in 404 AD by the western Emperor Honorius conjointly with his half-Vandal generalissimo Stilicho. Just six years later the city would be sacked by the latter’s Visigothic rival Alaric. But very few in that frightening present (Augustine being the most notable exception) could imagine a world without the Roman Empire. Consulships continued to mark political time; panegyrists continued to court potential patrons; rival dynasts continued to vie for the imperial purple; pan-imperial councils continued to address dogmatic and disciplinary issues. By the mid-5th century, such councils were becoming ever more self-referential and—one might say—selfimportant. The ecumenical council takes shape as an institution at once ecclesiastical and imperial. Its horoi (decisions, definitions) were intended to establish 7 8\n\nSusan Ashbrook Harvey, “To Whom Did Jacob of Sarug Preach?” in A Ministry of Reconciliation: Essays in Honor of Metropolitan Maximos Aghiorgoussis, ed.

Despite efforts throughout this period to define and codify orthodoxy, all too often conciliar horoi prompted new rounds of controversy. The end result was sharper delineation of identity boundaries and erection of new barriers to communication and communion. A related point is easy to overlook, perhaps because it is so obvious as to be unremarkable. Catholics and Chalcedonian Eastern Orthodox shared—and still share—a Roman imperial background and perspective. They have been impacted by the religious settlement initiated by Constantine in the fourth century, not always in the same way, but still in ways that distinguish them not only from the pre-Ephesine church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox churches but also from many Christian groups that have arisen in the wake of the Protestant Reformation (for example, those of the Anabaptist and Free Church traditions as distinct from the Anglican, Lutheran and Reformed state churches of northern Europe). They share an imperial ecclesiology. Their Roman experience has affected relationships, whether cozy or antagonistic, with the civil authority and with the wider culture. This experience also has affected their conceptions of church order. Until quite recently these churches have tended to insist on the principle of territoriality even in circumstances when its strict application becomes inconvenient or unenforceable. Whether among Protestants or even Catholics, insistence on this principle has been circumscribed in various ways over the past century. Among the Orthodox, however, disagreement over the significance and application of this principle lies at the heart of current debate over “canonical territory.” Before turning to this subject, it may be useful to consider the etymology and original meaning of the word “canon.” We often think of a canon as a piece of ecclesiastical legislation, something laid down by the competent legislator for the proper organization and governance of the church as an institution. Its original meaning was much richer. The Greek word kanon referred to the plumb line used by masons and builders, a tool for determining true vertical. By extension it referred to a basic rule or principle, something that was to be found, not made. The word thus comes to be used with reference to the rule of faith, i.e., the creed. It also was used with reference to behavior: “Peace and grace be upon all who walk by this kanon, the Israel of God” (Gal. 6:16). Finally, the word was used with reference to a rule or principle of church order. Some of the earliest texts that we call “canons” emanated from I Nicaea (325 AD)—the first ecumenical council. At the time they were not called canons at all, but rather decisions, horoi. Here is an example: If any presbyter has been advanced without examination, or if upon examination he has made confession of crime, and men acting in violation of the canon have laid\n\n28\n\nJohn H. Erickson hands upon him, notwithstanding his confession, such the canon does not admit, for the Catholic Church requires that which is blameless.9\n\nAs used here, the word canon does not mean that the fathers of Nicaea had before them an earlier piece of legislation on the subject of clerical behavior. The immediate reference is to the New Testament epistle to Titus: “Now the bishop, as God’s steward, must be blameless” (Titus 1:7). But even that is not a piece of legislation but simply the church’s age-old standard or rule. When considering a text of this sort, it is important to discern the kanon behind it. What values is it trying to uphold? What disvalues is it censuring? These general observations should be kept mind when we consider I Nicaea canon 8, which so often is cited in current inter-Orthodox debate, and the principle of territoriality expressed in its concluding words: “that there may not be two bishops in the city.” It is important, first of all, to keep in mind the historical context of the council. It was summoned by Constantine soon after he defeated his last rival to become sole Roman emperor. In his newly-acquired eastern half of the empire, the church was emerging from a period of intense persecution. Disputes had arisen not only over the doctrine of the Trinity (Arius and his theology) but also over reconciliation of the lapsed and related disciplinary matters. A rigorist schismatic group, the Novatianists, or “Pure Ones,” had already been in existence for many decades. At the time of the council, many of its leaders expressed full agreement with the church catholic on trinitarian dogma (the kanon tƝs pisteos of Nicaea). They also were vigorously opposed to Arius. They even agreed on Nicaea’s rules for calculating the date of Easter. This—in the eyes of the assembled bishops and the emperor—presented an opportunity. If the schism was not over dogma, over the faith itself, but over disciplinary issues, surely it would be appropriate to find a graceful way to receive the Novatianist clergy. Canon 8 recounts the council’s solution to this problem: If in villages or in cities, all of the ordained are found to be of these only [i.e., the socalled ‘Pure Ones’], let them remain in the clergy, and in the same rank in which they are found. But if they come over where there is a bishop or presbyter of the Catholic Church, it is manifest that the Bishop of the Church must have the bishop’s dignity; and he who was named bishop by those who are called Pure Ones shall have the rank of presbyter, unless it shall seem fit to the bishop to admit him to partake in the honor of the title. Or, if this should not be satisfactory, then shall the bishop provide for him a place as country bishop [chorepiscopos] or presbyter, in order that he may be evidently seen to be [a member] of the clergy, and that there may not be two bishops in the city.10\n\n9 Canon 9, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (see n. 4), 23. 10 Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (see n. 4), 20. Concerning the provision earlier in this canon for an imposition of hands on the reconciled Novatianist clergy, see the judicious comments of Peter L’Huillier, The Church of the Ancient Councils: The Disciplinary Work\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church\n\n29\n\nThis text tries to balance strictness and economy, akribeia and oikonomia, adherence to principle and prudent pastoral flexibility. The immediate pastoral purpose of the council fathers (and very likely of the emperor) was reconciliation of the Novatianists. To this end, the council fathers laid down detailed provisions for reception and integration of their clergy, lest there be any dispute or doubt about the legitimacy of their ministry. Then, in a brief concluding clause, they call attention—almost as an afterthought—to a principle that St Cyprian of Carthage and Cornelius of Rome had forcefully insisted upon when the Novatianist schism first arose in the mid-third century: In a city there can be but one ruling bishop. The council fathers of I Nicaea duly acknowledged this principle, this venerable kanon, but their immediate concern—putting an end to the Novatianist schism— gave them ample scope for displaying prudent flexibility. Might not the present situation in Ukraine call for the same kind of flexibility? As exponents of modern Eucharistic ecclesiology have emphasized, the principle of territoriality reflects a basic tenet of the Christian faith: that in Christ Jesus, “there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female” (Gal. 3:28). At the same time, it is important to consider what this principle meant in the actual life of the early church, at the time when the ancient canonical corpus was being formed. We need to consider certain basic words: the word “city,” for example, along with the related concepts of “place” and “local”; the word “bishop,” and with it the nature and exercise of authority in the church. We cannot speak of church structures and practices as “canonical” without taking into consideration how the meaning of such words has shifted over the centuries. For example, what does it mean to speak of “the bishop and his local church”? Today such phrases are used quite often in discussions of ecclesiology, but one wonders whether St. Ignatius and other early Christian sources would recognize what is meant by them. Orthodox Christians regularly use the term “local church” to refer to the ancient patriarchates and other autocephalous churches. Of these, one—the Russian Orthodox Church—stretches over eleven time zones. Such entities bear little resemblance to the face-to-face local churches of the ancient Mediterranean world. In antiquity the Roman Empire provided the template for the church’s evolving structures for communication and communion. This was a template that took for granted the preeminent role precisely of cities in the structuring of society— most of which were quite small by present-day standards. This was, in other words, a template that differed from that provided by our own (post-)modern society, with its sprawling megacities, or, for that matter, from many other societies that could be mentioned: warrior empires, seigneurial agrarian regimes, nomadic or transhumant cultures, long-term refugee camps. The template of the ancient of the First Four Ecumenical Councils (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1996), 59–60.\n\n30\n\nJohn H. Erickson\n\nRoman world did not begin by defining the outer limits or boundaries within which social controls would be exercised. Rather, it started with a number of urban centers, each with a keen sense of its own identity, whose effective force would be variously felt over a more or less extended hinterland. Cities (and churches) were defined less by their boundaries than by their reach, which could be felt in diverse ways and at varying distances. We should avoid projecting our later notions of patriarchates, i.e., neatly defined geographical entities, each possessing something analogous to the modern state’s internal and external sovereignty, onto the church of the Roman Empire, just as we should avoid projecting later notions of papal (or patriarchal) monarchy onto it. The church was an ordered communion of local churches, just as the empire itself was an ordered commonwealth of cities. These were bound together in multiple ways. Church historians most often have focused on conciliar and primatial structures and their evolution in late antiquity, but ties of a more informal nature were also important and should be kept in mind when discussing ecclesiology. Not only bishops and church personnel but also influential laypersons, monastics and even notable ascetics were linked through what we today would call social networking, lobbying activity, elite friendships, and client/patron relationships. Formal gatherings of bishops were not the only way that a sense of communion and community was fostered. Of local churches in the Roman world, some—depending on a variety of factors—possessed certain prerogatives, privileges, honors, rights and powers. But these presbeia—these prerogatives or privileges—were not uniform or held in equal measure. Terminology in texts of the period is quite fluid. Often, though not always, context can indicate what is meant. Sometimes presbeia may mean simply seniority or precedence, but in other cases it may mean the rights and prerogatives and privileges that go with seniority. Sometimes timƝ may mean “honor” as we often understand that word today: a mark of public recognition with few if any practical consequences. On the other hand, as Brian Daley has reminded us, “honor” in the ancient world can suggest “the grateful recognition not only of political goodness but of political service,” recognition normally expressed “through bestowal of office: an institutionalized position of public responsibility.”11 Honor in this sense was inseparable from responsibility and from recognized capacity for making authoritative decisions. This raises some questions. When canon 3 of I Constantinople accorded the bishop of Constantinople the “privileges of honor,” the presbeia tƝs timƝs, “after the bishop of Rome,” was it anticipating the major role that this see would play in the eastern part of the empire in later centuries? Or as recent scholars have argued, was this at the time simply a strategic move to bolster the prestige of the new Theodosian imperial\n\n11 Daley, “Position and Patronage” (see n. 8), 531.\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church\n\n31\n\nhouse and its chosen place of residence—a canon that for now was toothless, with no legislative clout?12 If I Constantinople canon 3 was vague about the content of presbeia, that was not so with the council of Chalcedon. At critical points the council distinguished between the merely honorific on the one hand and specific rights relating to jurisdiction and practical influence on the other. When Emperor Marcian formally received the council’s definition of faith, he decided to honor the little city of Chalcedon with “the rank (presbeia) of a metropolis; but we wish to honor it only with the name (onomati monǀ […] timƝsantes), and the proper role of the metropolitan city of Nicomedia is to be preserved.”13 On the other hand, there was nothing merely honorific about the presbeia conferred on the throne of Constantinople by canon 28. The canon is very clear on this point: “the metropolitans—and they alone—of the dioceses of Pontus, Asia and Thrace, as well as the bishops of the aforementioned dioceses who are among the barbarians, are to be ordained by the aforementioned most holy throne of the most holy Church of Constantinople.”14 Canon 28 gave Constantinople certain clearly specified—and clearly delimited—rights with regard to ordinations—to which we shall return. Two other canons (9 and 17) gave Constantinople certain less clearly defined rights in matters of judicial appeal. According to canon 9, “if a bishop or cleric has something against the metropolitan of the province in question, let him appeal either to the exarch of the diocese or to the see of the imperial city of Constantinople.” Similarly, according to canon 17, “if someone has been wrongly treated by his metropolitan, let him make an appeal either to the exarch of the diocese or to the see of Constantinople.” Were these provisions meant to apply, like the jurisdictional details of canon 28, only to the three minor civil dioceses of Pontus, Asia and Thrace? Or were they intended to recognize Constantinople as an alternative court of appeal for a much wider geographic area?15 Posed in this way, these questions present a false dilemma. Already during the period between 381 and 451 AD, appellate cases were being heard in Constantinople that arose not only in the three minor civil dioceses but also elsewhere in the eastern part of the empire, most conspicuously in the diocese of Orient, whose “exarch” would eventually bear the title of patriarch of Antioch, and also 12 See Neil McLynn, “‘Two Romes, Beacons of the Whole World’: Canonizing Constantinople,” in Two Romes: Rome and Constantinople in Late Antiquity, ed. Lucy Grig and Gavin Kelly (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 345–363, here 353–355; followed by Pigott, Reading Councils Backward (see n. 1), 106–107. 13 As cited by Daley, “Position and Patronage” (see n. 8), 544. 14 For discussion of the text of canon 28 and the circumstances of its drafting, see L’Huillier, Church of the Ancient Councils (see n. 10), 267–296, whose translation is largely followed here and in my discussion of Chalcedon canons 9 and 17. 15 For discussion of this point, see L’Huillier, Church of the Ancient Councils (see n. 10), 231–236, 251–254.\n\n32\n\nJohn H. Erickson\n\nin Eastern Illyricum.16 It is important, however, to recognize why appeals and other inter-diocesan matters might be directed to Constantinople. Its location provided a convenient venue for appellate cases. Thanks to the frequent presence there of visiting eastern prelates, whether for a celebratory event or for otherwise unrelated ecclesiastical matters, an enlarged synod could easily be assembled to address judicial matters. The point here is that Constantinople’s rights in matters of appeal were distinguished from the see’s rights in matters relating to ordination, which were much more limited. As Chalcedon canon 28 clearly specified, “the metropolitans—and they alone—of the dioceses of Pontus, Asia and Thrace […] are to be ordained by the most holy throne of the most holy Church of Constantinople.” Similar distinctions were made with regard to the presbeia of other major sees. The Council of Sardica, for example, gave Rome specific but very wide rights in matters of appeal, but this did not mean that Rome enjoyed comparably wide rights in matters of ordination, which were limited to the suburbicarian provinces of Italy; and neither the canons of Sardica nor other canons of the period directly addressed the question of Rome’s wider role within the communion of the churches. Quite simply, at the time of Chalcedon the prerogatives of major sees were not uniform or evenly distributed, and the bases for these various prerogatives were not always clearly defined. The patriarchal system of later centuries had not yet fully emerged—and, a fortiori, the modern system of autocephalous churches. Even in the age of Justinian the meaning and practical significance of terms like presbeia remained fluid. While that emperor’s Novella 131 chapter 2 (“Concerning the precedence of patriarchs”) has been seen as “canonizing” a pentarchy of patriarchates, chapter 3 immediately goes on to the archbishop of Justiniana Prima, confirming his primatial authority over much of the Balkan peninsula as granted previously in Novella 11—autocephaly, one might even say today. Chapter 4 continues with the bishop of Carthage, whose authority within the African church would be hard to characterize at any time in antiquity, whether before or after reconquest from the Vandals in 533–534 AD.17 16 In 421 a rescript of Theodosius II (Codex Theodosianus 16.2.45) gave Constantinople appellate jurisdiction over Eastern Illyricum, which by that point was administratively part of the Eastern Empire. The purported rescript claiming to abrogate it is a later fabrication. 17 On Justinian’s policies with regard to ecclesiastical organization, see especially Markus, “Carthage – Justiniana Prima – Ravenna” (see n. 5). Although the 6th-century city of Justiniana Prima was abandoned around 615 AD, the ecclesiastical title and prerogatives of the archbishopric of Justiniana Prima enjoyed a long afterlife, stretching through the Byzantine period well into the Ottoman period until suppression of its autocephalous status in 1767. For one segment of this afterlife, see Eleanora Naxidou, “An Aspect of the Medieval History of the Archbishopric of Ohrid: Its Connection with Justiniana Prima,” Byzantinoslavica 64, no. 1 (2006), 153–168. For another, see Tom Papademetriou, Render unto the Sultan: Power, Authority, and the Greek Orthodox Church in the Early Ottoman Centuries (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 130–132, 217–219 and passim.\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church\n\n33\n\nIn Chalcedon canon 28, what is the meaning and application of the phrase “bishops of the aforementioned dioceses who are among the barbarians”? This is perhaps the most divisive question being raised in inter-Orthodox debate today. It is quite clear, first of all, that this did not mean unlimited authority over bishops among the barbarians whoever and/or wherever they may be—over all the “diaspora” we might say today. It did not mean authority over regions of the upper Nile, which not only were adjacent to Egypt but also derived their earliest ecclesiastical structure from there, nor did it mean authority over regions to the east of the civil diocese of Orient, where similar considerations apply. In addition, given the concern for consistency with earlier canons evident elsewhere in canon 28, it is unlikely that the council tried to modify the provisions of canon 2 of I Constantinople, which had stated that “the churches of God among the barbarian peoples [en tois barbarikois ethnesi] are to be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the time of the Fathers.”18 Still more can be said about this phrase from Chalcedon canon 28. It is inserted, rather awkwardly, into provisions otherwise dealing with ordination of metropolitans and their provincial suffragan bishops in Pontus, Asia and Thrace— of metropolitans, and them alone, by Constantinople, but of their suffragans following the provisions for provincial ecclesiastical organization established in earlier canons (chiefly canons from the councils of I Nicaea and Antioch). The phrase clearly refers to bishops in some way related to “the aforementioned dioceses” but where the Roman political system, with its provincial organization, was not fully in force. As L’Huillier reminds us, “The borders of the empire were not conceived of as a fixed and immovable line.”19 In principle the empire was universal. Its effective frontiers were not. Sometimes Roman control extended into outlying regions. Sometimes it collapsed altogether. Either way, Christianity continued to spread, but not necessarily because of intentional activity on the part of a “missionary” or imperial sponsor. Merchants, chieftains, captives, slaves, ascetics and other unlikely agents also played a role, going back at least to the Gothic raids on Pontus and Cappadocia in the third century. If anything, the importance of this “mission from below” increased as the empire’s northern borders became increasingly porous after the Battle of Adrianople (378 AD). Whether on the distant fringes of imperial control or at the heart of the empire in New Rome itself, the presence of the barbarian Other offered new challenges but also new opportunities for mission and evangelization. Inevitably this involved boundary crossing, whether geographical, ethnic, linguistic, or cultural.20 That would be the case with St. John Chrysostom and his Gothic mission 18 Discipline Generale Antique (Codificazione canonica orientale, Fonti 9), ed. PericlesPierre Joannou (Grottaferrata: Tipografia Italo-Orientale “S. Nilo,” 1962), I.i.46–47. 19 L’Huillier, Church of the Ancient Councils (see n. 10), 279. 20 Of recent literature see Andrea Sterk, “Mission from Below: Captive Women and Conversion on the East Roman Frontiers,” Church History 79, no. 1 (2010), 1–39; Noel\n\n34\n\nJohn H. Erickson\n\nchurch in Constantinople. As the inserted phrase in canon 28 suggests, concern for culturally sensitive ministry after the model of the saint had not been forgotten at the time of the Council of Chalcedon.21 Historians—and church historians among them—are not oblivious to change, but generally speaking they prefer to describe this in terms of organic development or slow evolution. They prefer to trace out continuity in the institutions they study rather than identify discontinuities. As a result, they have difficulty recognizing disruptions so massive that they radically alter the physical and cultural landscape. This, I believe, has been the case for those who study the history and territorial organization of the Orthodox Church. They have difficulty addressing collective historical trauma—crushing defeats, deportations, holocausts, or even natural disasters. Coping mechanisms vary. Denial is one possibility; we struggle to forget what has been deeply painful or shameful. Another possibility is anger; we let old grievances become markers of our identity. One disruption in late antiquity deserves greater attention than generally is given to it: the arrival in the Roman Empire of bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) in 541–542. The plague’s empire-wide spread, its amplifications and episodic recurrences would continue into the mid-8th century.22 Standard histories of late antiquity recount the empire’s near-collapse from the mid-6th century onward. Military pressures—Avar incursions to the north, wars with Persia in the east, and eventual Arab conquests across Africa and greater Syria—resulted in major displacements of populations. But this was a period not just of displacement but of depopulation. The plague struck both urban and rural populations, from Constantinople (which during the first outbreak alone lost perhaps half its pre-plague Lenski, “Captivity and Romano-Barbarian Interchange,” in Romans, Barbarians, and the Transformation of the Roman World: Cultural Interaction and the Creation of Identity in Late Antiquity, ed.

Following its spectacular last explosion in Constantinople in 747, Emperor Constantine V had to resort yet again to forced migration in order to repopulate his devastated city.24 Displacement and depopulation were accompanied by deurbanization. This is reflected in episcopal subscription lists for church councils of the period. For III Constantinople (680–681 AD) and the Synod in Trullo (691–692 AD) practically none of the cities of central and western Greece, the Danube provinces and Illyricum are named. Although lists for Asia and Anatolia suggest that most sees still survived from earlier times, “archaeology shows that all, or nearly all, had been reduced to the condition of villages, or of fortresses.”25 Constantinople was now the city, the seat of both imperial and ecclesiastical authority. Subsequent cultural revivals in Constantinople’s medieval empire would not include revival of the conciliar and primatial structures that had characterized the early church. Elections of metropolitans come to take place in the synodos endƝmousa in Constantinople rather than in provincial councils, as had been prescribed in the relevant ancient canons. No doubt this was convenient, given that metropolitans spent so much of their time in the imperial capital. Convenient also was the increasingly common practice of electing and ordaining even bishops in the imperial capital.26 Changes such as these effectively eliminated conciliarity at the local level and significantly diminished it at the provincial level. The canons remained largely unchanged, a reminder of an earlier ecclesiology, but their interpretation and application did not. The earlier meaning of some words (e.g., “exarch”) completely changes.27 New institutions appear—for example, the stavropegial monastery, i.e., a monastery directly under the jurisdiction of the patriarch and thus not subject to the local bishop. Along the way, the operative model or image of the church changes. In the ante-Nicene period (here we idealize!) the church was envisioned as a circle, with the bishop in the midst of his local church and other ministers relating to him and to each other in the unity of Eucharistic celebration. In the post-Nicene period, it was envisioned as a polycentric communion of Eucharistic communities linked through conciliar and primatial structures reflective of the political organization of the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine period, the church comes to be envisioned as a vast pyramidal 23 For Constantinople and the Bavarian village of Aschheim respectively, Harper, Fate of Rome (see n. 22), 226, 230. 24 Ibid., 243.

Erickson\n\nstructure, with the patriarch and his substantial bureaucracy at its apex. In short, in its institutional expressions the Byzantine church comes to be very similar to its counterpart in the medieval west, the Roman papacy—something that was recognized at the time by distinguished churchmen on both sides.28 Viewed from our own present, of course, it is easy to overlook how much alike the Byzantine and Roman churches were in the Middle Ages. We have grown accustomed to placing them in opposition through most of their history. We forget how much contemporaries have in common, even when they quarrel. For several centuries, despite adverse changes in circumstances, RomanByzantine imperial ideology remained largely intact, and with it the sense of belonging to a single Christian commonwealth. But this began to change in the wake of the 1204 Latin conquest of Constantinople. The 13th century saw the establishment of a new autocephalous church in the Balkans, the Serbian archbishopric of Peü (1219), and the reestablishment of another, the Bulgarian patriarchate of Trnovo (1235). Both came into existence through bilateral treaties between the emerging Serbian and Bulgarian kingdoms and the Greek rump empire of Nicaea. Autocephaly was on its way to becoming an expression of national and political independence, “the status symbol of a new ‘Christian nation’,” as Alexander Schmemann put it.29 Whereas autocephaly formerly had meant independence on a purely ecclesiastical level, now it was related to political independence. Also evident in this period is an incipient sense of ethnic identity. This is most conspicuous among the Balkan Slavs. For example, the bishops ordained by St. Sava for his newly autocephalous church were Serbs as distinct from Greeks, and in places where there was a Greek incumbent, he was ousted. A similar shift in sense of identity can be seen in some Greek circles. Intellectuals at the court of Nicaea praised classical letters and art and even began to use the word Hellene—Greek— in a positive sense. (Hitherto it had meant pagan as opposed to Christian.) At the same time, a new sense of (Orthodox) universalism can be detected. Old symbols of unity and order—the emperor and his once-universal empire, the pentarchy of patriarchs—were fading in significance. Taking their place on the institutional level was the patriarch of Constantinople, who effectively replaced the emperor as symbol of the unity of the Orthodox Christian world. Taking their 28 On similarities between Rome and Constantinople in this period see Dimiter Angelov, “The Donation of Constantine and the Church in Late Byzantium,” in Church and Society in Late Byzantium, ed. Dimiter Angelov (Kalamazoo, MI: Medieval Institute Publications, 2009), 91–159, esp.105–143. Among other things, Angelov discusses canonist Theodore Balsamon’s use of the Donation of Constantine to boost the authority of the chartophylax and other high officials of the patriarchal court, whom he regarded as equals to the cardinals of the papal court. 29 Alexander Schmemann, Church, World, Mission (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1979), 85–116, on 98. For more on developments during this period, see John H. Erickson, “Autocephaly in Orthodox Canonical Literature to the Thirteenth Century,” St. Vladimir’s Theological Quarterly 15 (1971), 28–41, 34–40.\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church\n\n37\n\nplace on the spiritual and ideological level was what some modern scholars have referred to as “political hesychasm” or the “hesychast international,” so-called because many exponents of hesychast spirituality also advanced a social, cultural and political program that profoundly affected the entire Orthodox world. These agents of institutional and cultural continuity would provide a measure of leadership, stability and unity during the centuries of Ottoman domination that followed. In this Byzance après Byzance, shared religion, now reinforced by marginalization, continued to unite Orthodox Christians, trumping—at least for a time— whatever power ethnicity, language and similar factors might have had to divide them.30 Nationalism, replete with romantic myths about national origins, language and character, would emerge as a significant factor in Orthodox church life only in the late 18th and 19th century—and with nationalism, the modern autocephalous church. The first stirrings of this modern nationalism in the Balkans can be felt among educators and other intelligentsia, who promoted the study of national language, history and culture. But as Paschalis Kitromilides observes: Nationalism became a real, as opposed to a theoretical problem for Orthodoxy once the peoples of the Balkans rose up in arms against Ottoman rule in the early nineteenth century. The protracted revolts in the Balkans […] provided the crucible for the transformation of the Orthodox religious communities of the Balkans into modern nations. Part of the transformation involved the radical reshaping of local ecclesiastical communities from branches of ecumenical Orthodoxy into components of new nations.31\n\nIf revolts were the crucible for this transformation, the new nation states themselves were largely responsible for forging it through mass media, educational programs, the modernization of the military and other state institutions.32 But was 30 On Nicolae Iorga’s, Byzance après Byzance: Continuation de l’Histoire de la vie byzantine (Bucharest: Institut d’études byzantines, 1935), see the recent bibliographical study by Ovidiu Olar, “Byzance après Byzance: Nicolae Iorga’s Paradigm,” Mapping Eastern Europe, July 13, 2021, https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/byzance-apresbyzance-nicolae-iorgas-paradigm. 31 Paschalis Kitromilides, “The Legacy of the French Revolution: Orthodoxy and Nationalism,” in The Cambridge History of Christianity, ed.

Erickson\n\nthis process inevitable, determined by the conditions of modernity and its accompanying secularism? In the closing decades of the 19th century, the obsolescence of the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional empires of the Ottomans, Hapsburgs and Romanovs was by no means self-evident whether to their conservative governments, their cultural and economic elites, their general populations, or indeed to outside observers. While assassinations and terrorist attacks were already part of their present, only the rare few could have predicted the wars, genocides, concentration camps, and ethnic cleansings of the 20th century. Recent scholarship, drawing on a wide range of hitherto inaccessible archival sources, has drawn attention to efforts during this period, particularly on the part of Russia, to defuse western-inspired nationalism by providing a supranational alternative putatively more in keeping with the traditional religious and cultural values of the Balkans and Near East.33 More concretely, for Russia this meant support for the patriarchate of Constantinople and other expressions of pan-Orthodox cooperation even when self-interest might point in other directions. Wellplaced Russian churchmen, scholars, diplomats and public intellectuals of NeoByzantine orientation regularly pleaded the patriarchate’s cause, assuring cultural collaboration and generous, but carefully calibrated, financial support. In addition, the steady flow of pilgrims rich and poor, whether to the Holy Land or to Mount Athos or to Russia’s own newly-discovered sacred sites in Crimea, helped build a sense of Orthodox familial identity that crossed lines of ethnicity, language, education, and social status.34 Meanwhile the patriarchate of Constantinople was burnishing its own claims to historical continuity and authority. Readers of popularizing works on Orthodox church history will be familiar with discussion of the millet system and the place of the Patriarch of Constantinople within it during Ottoman times. For a long time, the widely accepted view was that “the Ottoman Empire integrated non-Muslim populations by bestowing their spiritual leaders,” such as the patriarch of Constantinople, “with fiscal and administrative jurisdiction, while at the same time facilitating the exercise of religious functions.”35 Fewer readers will be 33 Denis Vovchenko, Containing Balkan Nationalism: Imperial Russia & Ottoman Christians, 1856–1914 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016), 4–6, 12–13, 67–69, 132– 143, 188–190, 218–225 and passim; and Lora Gerd, Russian Policy in the Orthodox East: The Patriarchate of Constantinople (1878–1914), (Warsaw/Berlin: De Gruyter Open, 2014), especially 30–39. 34 Mara Kozelsky, Christianizing Crimea: Shaping Sacred Space in the Russian Empire and Beyond (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2010), passim; and more recently Mara Kozelsky, “Religion and the Crisis in Ukraine,” International Journal for the Study of the Christian Church 14, no. 3 (2014), 219–241, https://doi.org/10.1080/1474225X. 2014.957635. 35 Antonis Hadjikyriacou, “Beyond the Millet Debate: Communal Representation in PreTanzimat-Era Cyprus,” in Political Thought and Practice in the Ottoman Empire, ed.

They would agree with conclusions reached by Antonis Hadjikyriacou in a recent article summing up the millet debate: Whatever the millet system may have been, it is overrated. At most, if it functioned as anything resembling a centralized and institutionalized system, it did so from the second half of the nineteenth century onward […] Projecting the mid-nineteenth century experience […] back to an immemorial past was a legitimation tool that claimed historical depth, institutional status, and the legal weight of custom and tradition. The historical record, however, does not back these claims.37\n\nThe Orthodox leadership in Constantinople excelled at projecting 19th-century aspirations onto the past, though of course they were not the only ones doing it. This is evident from the abundance of material artifacts of this period—from the grandiose Great School of the Nation in Constantinople to paintings, posters, postcards and other ephemera—that celebrate Patriarch Gennadios Scholarios and his (mythic) meeting with Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453.38 Depictions of this meeting and allusions to it served several purposes. Against the irredentist rhetoric and ethnocultural claims emanating from Athens, they proclaimed the unbroken continuity of the Greek cultural heritage in Constantinople even as Byzantine imperial rule ceded to Ottoman. Against the various centrifugal ethnic and nationalist movements of the day, they witnessed to the loyalty of nation and church to the Ottoman Empire.

Erickson\n\nto the church’s privileges or from lay elements within the community, they attested to the importance of the church’s traditional hierarchical structures. But the story-line presented through these artifacts surely underplays the disruption that accompanied the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It ignores the degraded position of patriarchs during the first centuries of Ottoman rule, when they seldom enjoyed long, uninterrupted tenures and in effect served as tax-farmers for the sultan.39 For both individuals and institutions, the transition to Ottoman rule may have been more traumatic than the mid-19th-century narratives suggest. For the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the last decades of the 19th century were also a period of diminishing resources. Issuance of a tomos of autocephaly to a new daughter church typically included some financial compensation in return, but this did not make up for loss of a fixed income. Subsidies from Russia were welcome, but generally there were strings attached. Growing dependence on subsidies from Greece could compromise the patriarchate’s traditional ecumenical role within the Ottoman Empire and beyond. Handouts from rich bankers could create pastoral problems within the wider community. One untapped resource remained: the Greek colonies abroad, a far-flung diaspora in the sociological sense of the word, whose homelands real or imagined lay within the Ottoman Empire when it was at its height. But that empire no longer ruled Greece and many other homelands. Now that empire was widely vilified. This could create problems for the patriarchate and its patrons, who benefited in various ways from their position within the empire. Further complicating matters was energetic Russian mission activity among the autochthonous populations of the Russian Empire and beyond, including China, Japan, Korea and North America. These issues were on the minds of churchmen both in Constantinople and in Greece during the closing decades of the 19th century and the opening decades of the 20th. Along the way, the referent of “diaspora” shifts, from people dispersed from their place of origin (their “homeland”) whether as colonizers or as refugees or what have you, to the place (“foreign land”) where they now lived, in the midst of alien peoples, trying to fashion a home away from home. A new round of Balkan wars, the coming of World War I and revolutions in Russia revealed the fragility of the imperial present and fostered plans and visions for the future that ranged from the apocalyptic to the merely ambitious. Relentless Communist persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church nearly liquidated it, bringing an end to its once-enormous influence in the Orthodox world. Meanwhile the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the disastrous failure of the Greek Megali Idea in Asia Minor, and the resultant exchange of Greek and Turkish populations in 1923 left patriarchs of Constantinople with a greatly diminished flock in the new Turkish republic. Perhaps as a consequence, they became more inclined than ever to emphasize their wider authority within world Orthodoxy. 39 Papademetriou, Render unto the Sultan (see n.17), 215–217 and passim.\n\nTerritorial Organization of the Orthodox Church\n\n41\n\nIn the wake of World War I, redrawn political boundaries in Eastern Europe transformed the old multi-ethnic empires into a collection of new nation-states. Nearly four million Orthodox Christians who hitherto had been Russian subjects found themselves within the new Polish republic. Under pressure from the Polish government, a reluctant hierarchy petitioned the patriarchate of Constantinople for autocephaly, which was quickly granted. A similar process led to autonomy for the Orthodox churches in Finland, Estonia and Czechoslovakia. But in the wake of World War II, after the Soviet government at long last allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to reorganize, that church was quick to respond to what it regarded as Constantinople’s unwarranted claims and actions. It reasserted its own jurisdiction over Estonia, which by that point had been re-annexed to the Soviet Union; took a dominant role in Czechoslovakia (by declaring it autocephalous) and in Poland (by redeclaring it autocephalous); and convoked a pan-Orthodox council in Moscow to mark the five-hundredth anniversary of its own (self-declared) autocephaly. During the Cold War, relations between Orthodox churches of the Soviet bloc and Orthodox churches of the “free world” reflected global political tensions, but as open hostility gave way to peaceful coexistence and then to détente, relations improved. Opportunities for contact increased, especially after the Orthodox churches of the Soviet bloc joined the World Council of Churches in 1961. In the same year, Patriarch Athenagoras of Constantinople initiated a series of pan-Orthodox conferences to prepare the way for a Great and Holy Council of the Orthodox Church. The conferences were greeted with enthusiasm, but progress could be described as glacial. In 1971 an Inter-Orthodox Preparatory Commission met for the first time and published draft documents on six topics, but the death of Patriarch Athenagoras in the following year left the entire council project in limbo. Thereafter, informal inter-Orthodox meetings concluded that if a council was to proceed, massive revision of the agenda was needed. The proposed topics did not correspond to the real needs of the church; the draft reports on them were little more than academic exercises; surely such issues as autocephaly, autonomy and the status of churches in the diaspora were more in need of consideration. In the background, of course, was controversy over the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), which had been granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970. The First Pan-Orthodox Preconciliar Conference at last met in 1976 and issued a revised agenda that included the topics in question. Thereafter the InterOrthodox Preparatory Commission began working away. It set aside those sensitive topics until last, hoping that the churches’ experience of working together on simpler issues would make agreement on more difficult issues easier to achieve. That proved not to be the case. In the late 1980s and 1990s, enormous changes were taking place in world Orthodoxy, especially in Russia and Eastern Europe. With the collapse of communism, the churches there gained new freedom\n\n42\n\nJohn H. Erickson\n\nand opportunities for growth, but this did not lead to a higher level of interOrthodox cooperation on a global level. Preparatory work for a council continued, but with diminished vigor. In 1990 and 1993, meetings of the Inter-Orthodox Preparatory Commission addressed two closely interrelated topics, the “diaspora” and autocephaly, and also touched on autonomy. Its point of departure was background reports from the churches, which by then were already over ten years old. In them three main lines of thinking can be discerned:40 1) The report of the Romanian Orthodox Church argued that each autocephalous mother church has the right to govern its own national “diaspora.” It also acknowledged that churches formed as a result of missionary activity constitute a special case, “since they belong to a different nationality than the members of the missionizing church.” In such cases, autocephaly may be envisioned. 2) Reports of the churches of Greek heritage (Alexandria, Constantinople, Greece) appealed to I Constantinople canon 3 and above all to Chalcedon canon 28. Because of its presbeia tƝs timƝs, Constantinople and only Constantinople has the right to exercise jurisdiction outside its territorial boundaries, in all geographical areas that lie outside the boundaries of the other duly established and universally recognized autocephalous churches. According to this interpretation of Chalcedon canon 28, Constantinople has jurisdiction not only over Pontus, Asia and Thrace but also the right to consecrate bishops “among the barbarians”—i.e., in the “diaspora.” As for autocephaly, only a council of ecumenical standing (such as a Great and Holy Council) can definitively establish an autocephalous church, with any interim arrangements depending on approbation by Constantinople acting in its capacity as the ultimate “mother church.” 3) The report of Russian Orthodox Church (and also the shorter report of Antioch) took a more pragmatic approach. Like the Romanian report, it rejected the Greek interpretation of Chalcedon canon 28 and I Constantinople ca"
