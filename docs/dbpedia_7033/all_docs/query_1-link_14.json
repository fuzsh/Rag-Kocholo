        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Kurt,\n\nIn actuality, Russian theologians have been fascinated by the Tibetans and their religious practices that do resemble those of the Orthodox Church.\n\nFor example, the Tibetans use prayer beads, make prostrations and a number of other ritual similarities.\n\nThe jury is out on the influence of the Assyrian Church of the East on Tibet, since, in the 9th century, Tibet had two Assyrian Archbishops and 20 Bishops in that area during the time of the T'ang Dynasty (to which Queen Elizabeth the Second is related, distantly, by Royal blood-line).\n\nLater persecution destroyed the Assyrian Church and the Orthodox prince of Rus' St Theodore of Smolensk later married the Mongolian Khan's daughter and established Orthodox Churches in Mongolia and China in the 13th century, a project supported by his sons, Sts. Constantine and David, themselves half-Mongolian.\n\nAs you know, Tibetan Buddhism was a cross between Mahayana Buddhism and the native pagan Tibetan religion of the Bon.\n\nThis religion could very well have adopted a number of Assyrian Church practices including the mitres of the Tibetans that exist to this day.\n\nRus' itself had many ties to Tibet and China via the trade-routes. The literary word for \"orange\" in both Russian and Ukrainian is the adopted German \"apelsina\" or \"Chinese apple\" as oranges first appeared there via China.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Daniil,\n\nIf you could speak more to this fascinating subject, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWhat is the practice in your parish and what is its rationale? I think your parish would serve as the best possible example in so many things!\n\nSome parishes, following I believe a Latin Church practice, exchange the white veils for black or purple ones denoting sorrow.\n\nThe Latin Church also had (still has?) the practice of draping statues with black or purple cloths during Passion Week.\n\nIn some areas of Eastern Europe, it was considered irreverent for couples to make love in rooms where there were icons.\n\nSome developed the practice of draping the veils over the entire icon as a sign of \"respect\" before so doing.\n\nWhen people had an argument in the Carpathians, they would sometimes do the same in case someone used a profane word before the icons.\n\nThe veils themselves have particular usages that punctuate rites of passage.\n\nIt is still common for couples about to wed to kneel together on such an embroidered veil for a blessing from their parents and then this veil is used to cover the icons they receive in Church.\n\nKozaks knelt on such veils to receive the blessing from priests or their families before undergoing their crusades as well.\n\nThe veil can also be placed over pictures of e.g. Taras Shevchenko to denote a particular mark of respect for an individual, a family member. Sometimes a visiting hierarch is draped about the shoulders with such an embroidered veil.\n\nThis is where the similarity with the Tibetan practice lies.\n\nWhenever the Dalai Lama meets the Pope, he always places one of his veils around the Pope as a sign of respect and you then get to keep the veil.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is covered in such veils on his birthday.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 838\n\nGLORY TO JESUS CHRIST!\n\nGLORY TO HIM FOREVER!\n\nAlex wrote:\"...the roots of the practice of the embroidered veil cloth are taken from the Hebrew Scriptures and the \"Tzith-tziths\" with tassels that the Hebrews wore and still wear...\"\n\nBut the patterns found on the rushnyky are ancient pre-Christian patterns that invoke the protection and blessing of the ancient fertility goddess. Many of these same patterns are found in the pysanky made during the Great Fast.\n\nAlthough the pysanky now how Christian meanings, the ancient meanings were wishes for prosperity and fertility.\n\nFor example, looking at the rushnyky on the site Alex gave, the red ones all have the central theme of a diamond with cross-hatched lines and spirals. These are often shown on pysanky and called \"FISHNETS\" to show that Christians are the fishers of men. In ancient times, this pattern was called the Fertile Field and was a wish for prosperous Spring with bountiful crops. The spirals are ancient symbols for the sun god.\n\nSorry to spout but have 4 dozen pysanky done already and still working....so many eggs, so little time.....\n\nmark\n\nthe ikon writer"
