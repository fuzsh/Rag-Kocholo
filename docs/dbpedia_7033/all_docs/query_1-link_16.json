        "text": "In the early twentieth century, a sense of national consciousness began to develop among Ukrainians. In the previous chapter, we reviewed the events and figures who contributed to the evolution of the nascent Ukrainian national identity. Churchmen were included among the intellectuals who sought the creation of an independent church alongside a sovereign state. Events in the history of the Kyivan Metropolia became commemorative markers contributing to the formation of a movement for ecclesial sovereignty, accompanied by the nineteenth century phenomenon of the formation of autocephalous churches in newly-formed nation-states in the debris of imperial collapse. 1 The Ukrainian intellectuals who adhered to the national dream were aware of the formation of autocephalous Churches in Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The Bulgarian example was a cautionary tale, since the movement for autocephaly introduced the unfortunate tendency for churches to exclude anyone who was not ethnically Bulgarian from membership and participation. The Constantinopolitan synod of 1872 condemned this policy as ethnophyletism, the heresy of limiting participation in ecclesial life to people of an exclusive national identity. 2 The Ukrainians who dreamed of an autocephalous Church sought to excise their notion of a unique religious identity from the amalgamation of identities that had formed during the period of Kyiv's annexation to the Russian empire.\n\nIn this essay, I will examine the dynamics of intra-Christian division currently unfolding in Ukraine. My aim is to develop a working thesis which has two parts: first, to illuminate what is at stake for global Orthodoxy when we examine the Ukrainian Church situation. The theological task is not to resolve a minor disruption, but to contribute to a lasting peace. The second part is to view the contemporary Ukrainian picture through the lens of the modern history of Orthodox Ukraine. My conviction is that an honest historical examination can yield patterns enriching understanding, which is a sine qua non for our common theological task. My essay has three parts. The first part summarizes the intra-Christian divisions in Ukraine through the lenses of ecclesial legitimacy and identity. This section draws from selections of narratives developed and communicated by the three most influential Churches in Ukraine: the Moscow-Patriarchate (UOC-MP); the Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP); and the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic Church (UGCC). I will illuminate the diverse perspectives on each Church's ecclesial legitimacy and identity through primary documents and external analyses. The second part of my presentation connects the present images of ecclesial legitimacy and identity with their historical antecedents, drawing primarily from late-19 th century and twentieth century sources. The final section of the essay discusses the patterns contributing to the situation in light of the task of contemporary Orthodox theology.\n\nThere is an ancient tradition within Christianity whose worship and culture are distinctly Eastern, Byzantine/Greek, and Orthodox. In Ukraine there are four large Churches that are part of this tradition: the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC), the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), the Ukrainian Autocephalist Orthodox Church (UAOC), and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP). All of these Churches have the same commitment to salvation through Christ, the same belief in the reality and efficacy of the Holy Mysteries (or Sacraments), the same (or very similar) Rite of Worship, and the same (or very similar) ecclesiology (e.g. “apostolic succession”). Ironically, they also profess the same commitment to fulfilling God's desire that “we all be one as He is one” (St. John 17:22b). This is ironic because none of these groups, despite their common beliefs, culture, and purpose, are in communion with one another. Instead, they have parallel structures and often act more like competitors than brothers in our Lord Jesus Christ. In this paper, I describe the common genesis of these Churches and the five “moments” that led to their division, how their disorder asserted itself in America, how some of these divisions in America have been overcome, and how this reconciliation provides reason for our hope of closer ecclesiastical cooperation and even unity in Ukraine."
