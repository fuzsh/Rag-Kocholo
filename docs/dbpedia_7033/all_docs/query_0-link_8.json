        "text": "OP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 87\n\nA week ago I submitted this to a forum on languages, where I was supposed to get help with this sort of thing. So far two dozen people looked at my questions and no one has replied. I suppose it is not entirely off topic here, because the document in question is the intro to Polotniuk's chant book. It has been translated by a better Ukrainianist than I, but a few problems remain unsolved and I am trying to clear them up. First, Polotnjuk has a long list of acknowledgements in which he thanks a great number of people who helped in one way or another. He begins with a sentence about thanking \"the following persons\"--_sliduiuchi P. T. osoby_. What does P.T. mean? There ought to be a dictionary of Ukrainian abbreviations, but so far I have been unable to trace any such thing, and I can't even guess what this stands for.\n\nSecond, Polotnjuk states that he has omitted from the music the _dybuvany dodatky_ that appear in some other collections. _Dybuvany_? When no help came from the other list, I made a stab at this myself. _Dybaty_ has the meaning 'to go on stilts, walk clumsily_. The -uva- infix is the mark of the second imperfective, with a frequentative meaning (that is, denoting repeated action). So I propose that it means here 'stumbling,' or less colorfully 'clumsy additions'. Any comments?\n\nAnd one more thing: _pozaiak_? Looks like an adverb, but what does it mean?\n\nStephen\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 10,090\n\nLikes: 15\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by Stephen R.:\n\nSo _dybuvany dodatky_ is really almost redundant! What is the verb, and why can't I find it any dictionary?\n\nStephen,\n\nLet me first disclaim any knowledge of Ukrainian, but I won't let that stop me .\n\nI'm unsure why you're looking for a verb; given the definition that Alex offered and your description of the context in which the words were rendered\n\nQuote\n\nPolotnjuk states that he has omitted from the music the _dybuvany dodatky_ that appear in some other collections\n\nI would suggest that he means he has omitted what he perceives to be \"superfluous (or, perhaps, \"awkward\") additions\" that others have included in their collections.\n\nIf my observation makes no sense, I apologize and withdraw it, but given the textual context that you've offered, it seems a reasonable reading.\n\nMany years,\n\nNeil\n\n\"One day all our ethnic traits ... will have disappeared. Time itself is seeing to this. And so we can not think of our communities as ethnic parishes, ... unless we wish to assure the death of our community.\"\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Friend,\n\nYes, \"Podibny tym.\" This reminds me of the time in the seventies when there was a Russian Orthodox service in New York that was attended by members of the Soviet Embassy.\n\nA Ukrainian language organ wrote, tongue in cheek, that \"there were 'laity' present from the Soviet embassy as well, such as the chief of the KGB and other 'laity' \"yim podibny\" or 'similar to them.'\"\n\nThe second sentence reads \"The issue of the accent in our church books is not yet finalized\" (which is not really true and is only true in that context because of the Russophile Ukrainian translators who insisted on the Russian accent that is STILL in our UGCC liturgical texts - this according to Met. Ilarion Ohienko and he gives enough examples to prove his case, I believe).\n\nThe third phrase (and Neil is quite right) refers to \"additions\" and the first word basically reads as \"stuck on\" to indicate that the additions are not really organic to the whole or don't really belong.\n\nThe \"High Ukrainian\" of our scholarly people can be quite trying . . .\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Administrator,\n\nAnd my wife can't stand mushrooms . . .\n\nThis has led me to sometimes make rather rude comments about her Ukrainian identity . . .\n\nThe only saving grace is that she doesn't mind garlic . . .\n\nIf she did, I would really have to start thinking about whether ours is a truly ethnically \"mixed\" marriage . . .\n\nCultural identity, as you so correctly have pointed out, is not only about what comes out of one's mouth - but also about what goes into it!\n\nA blessed Fast to you!\n\nMine isn't for a while yet . . .\n\nAlex\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 87\n\nThanks Alex; thanks Neil. Just what I needed.\n\nNeil, I inquired about the verb because _dybuvany_ is obviously a participle, so the usual way to find it in a dictionary would be to look under the infinitive of the verb. I drew kind of a blank in most dictionaries, which only told my that _dybatsia_ means 'to stand on end' (said of hair) and that kind of thing. I also checked Russian and Polish dictionaries for the cognates, but still found little of help. The most relevant appeared to be _dybaty_ 'to go on stilts, walk awkwardly,' which I found in a larger Ukr. dictionary in a more academic library. Alex has resolved the problem nicely. Really, all that remains is to look up the toponyms in a references work I have used before, of which there is a copy only a little over a hundred miles away . . . .\n\nI also didn't find _pazaiak_ in the dictionaries.\n\nAs for the Slavonic accents, I too get a bit tired of being lectured on \"correct\" Slavonic by those who seem to think that everyone else got Slavonic from Moscow. My understanding is that the present recension is based on the work of Meletii Smotryc'kyj in the early 17th century (he was Bielarusian, so one might write Mialeci Smatrycki), and that he aimed at a 'neutral' Slavonic that could be used by Ukrainians, Russians, and Bielarusians equally.\n\nStephen\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Stephen,\n\nAs you know, Melety Smotritsky was the antagonist of St Josaphat of Polotsk.\n\nMelety was proposed for Beatification by the Basilian Fathers and an icon was written of him that is in the book \"St Josaphat Kuncewicz.\"\n\nThe Orthodox still honour him highly as they feel that his becoming a uniate was because of his guilt over Josaphat's death etc.\n\nMet. Ilarion Ohienko wrote a small book on the subject of Belarusyans and Ukrainians and shows how for 400 years, authors called Ukrainians \"White Russians.\"\n\nInteresting, no?\n\nAlex (who doesn't care what you call him, only THAT you call him!)\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 87\n\nDear Alex,\n\nYes, I know that history. It was not a happy time. I'm inclined to blame Ipatii Potii for instituting the policy of coercion and drawing Josaphat into it. We Orthodox don't hear very much about Josaphat's saintly qualities, but I suspect that if he been born a century earlier he would be on our calendar. On the other side, Greek Catholics do not hear very much about the repression of Orthodoxy, first in Vilnius and then in Polock: the popular accounts depict fanatic Cossacks murdering a saintly bishop apparently without provocation.\n\nI cringe thinking about the events at the end of the Second World War, and at the continued refusal on the part of some Orthodox to face the historical facts. Both parties really must do this, about the entire course of events from 1596 to the present, and realize clearly that oppression is not only morally unacceptable but also usually counterproductive in the often not very long run.\n\nRenouncing something done on Stalin's orders should be easy. But the refusal to come to grips with reality is strong. Among some of us, Peter the Great still emerges as a hero in some versions of history; Bp Semashko is praised; arrgh!\n\nWell, I really believe that the day is coming when we will have historians on both sides who give essentially the same account, sine ira et studio. I only wish it were here now. I eagerly await the completion of Sophia Senyk's big History--there's a historian I like.\n\nStephen"
