At the beginning of the 20th century, a new educational institution was opened on Bulvarno-Kudryavska Street, founded thanks to the donations of patron Mykola Tereshchenko. Since then, there have been various educational institutions in the premises. In April 2010, the Borys Grinchenko Museum was opened in this building, which explores the life path and contribution of the outstanding scientist to the development of Ukrainian culture and education.

Borys Grinchenko himself consecrated the premises of the university rectorate, which was renamed in his honor, with his fruitful activities dedicated to enlightenment and the development of education in Ukraine. Now in the Museum you can familiarize yourself with his scientific heritage and feel his deep love for the Motherland. The exposition of the Museum reflects the time of Borys Grinchenko, his incredible hard work. All exhibits and funds of the Museum are selected with respect and love for the Great Enlightener.
