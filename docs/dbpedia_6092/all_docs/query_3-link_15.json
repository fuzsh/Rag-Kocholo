The main attention is focused on clarifying the basis of Ukrainian studies and its significance in the system of national education. Boris Grinchenko considered the awakening of national consciousness to be the main goal of his life. Continuing the best traditions of pedagogical thought in Ukraine about writing textbooks, Boris Grinchenko creatively comprehends what was done by his predecessors, in particular T. Shevchenko's \"Primer\", P. Kulish's textbooks and, using his own practical experience as a teacher, creates textbooks for elementary school \"Primer\" and native word. Ukrainian Reading”. The general cultural, psychological and methodological aspects of teaching the native language are most represented in the pedagogical legacy of Boris Grinchenko. He noted that only an impeccable command of the language gives the child the means for a deep understanding of reality, for education and development in the pedagogical process. The textbooks he created were a continuation of the traditions of Ukrainian national-educational thought, where the ideological, moral and aesthetic potential of folk art, ethnopedagogy, and ethnology is of dominant importance.\n\nItem Type: Book Section Keywords: Borys Grinchenko, educational activities, national education, textbooks, Ukrainian studies, teaching, Ukrainian language.
