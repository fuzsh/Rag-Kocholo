THE POLEMICAL LITERATURE OF THE 16TH TO 18TH CENTURIES\n\nThe Cossack period, or the Middle period of Ukrainian literature, began in the 16th century. It was a historical time of great unrest and political upheaval which culminated in the Cossack-Polish War of 1648-54, and of religious strife between the Uniates and the Orthodox, which centered around the Church Union of Berestia in 1596. Yet this period is also noted in Ukraine for its vibrant and varied cultural activity. One important mode of literary culture that arose as a consequence of religious controversy over the Church Union of Berestia was a rich polemical literature written in Old Ukrainian and in Old Polish, rarely in Church Slavonic. The stormy religious and political polemics were initiated by the Polish Jesuits Piotr Skarga and Benedykt Herbest, who harshly criticized the institutional and spiritual 'vices' of the Orthodox church. In response the Orthodox published two treatises by Herasym Smotrytsky of the Ostrih Academy which were followed by a multitude of works by various authors; these works varied in size and form from short, sharply worded 'epistles' to long scholarly exposes. From a literary point of view, the most important place in the polemical literature of the period is occupied by a brilliant stylist and maximalist defender of Orthodoxy and Eastern asceticism, Ivan Vyshensky... Learn more about the Ukrainian polemical literature of the 16th to 18th centuries by visiting the following entries:\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries featuring the Ukrainian polemical literature of the 16th to 18th centuries were made possible by the financial support of the STEPHEN AND OLGA PAWLUK UKRAINIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT FUND at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (Edmonton, AB, Canada).\n\nIII. UKRAINIAN LITERATURE OF THE LATE BAROQUE PERIOD (18TH CENTURY)\n\nAlthough the Cossack period in Ukrainian literature lasted until the end of the 18th century, it had begun to decline with the signing of the Pereiaslav Treaty of 1654. A crisis in the Ukrainian literary culture became particularly acute at the end of the baroque period in the 18th century, when Ukraine came under ever-increasing Russian domination. In 1709 Hetman Ivan Mazepa in league with Charles XII of Sweden, failed in his attempt to wrest Ukraine from Russian control. In 1723 the Hetman state lost the right to choose its own hetmans. As a result of Tsar Peter I's church reforms, numerous Ukrainian bishops and churchmen received ecclesiastical offices in Russia and were forced to leave Ukraine. Among them were the leading Ukrainian writers of the time Stefan Yavorsky, Dymytrii Tuptalo, and Teofan Prokopovych. Much of the Ukrainian literature of the baroque period was written in the Ukrainian redaction of Church Slavonic, the language of the Ukrainian church. (Polish, Latin, and the Ukrainian vernacular were also used by various Ukrainian writers.) However, in 1720 Peter banned all ecclesiastical printing in Ukrainian by decree, and the government-enforced process of Russification of the Ukrainian literature began. Various elements of Russian entered the Ukrainian literary language and the bookish language of the educated class grew consistently farther away from the Ukrainian vernacular. By the end of the 18th century, in order to have their works printed, most Ukrainian writers were compelled to write in Russian or (as in the late works of Hryhorii Skovoroda) in a language close to Russian including various Ukrainianisms. Also important in ending the Cossack period in Ukrainian literature was the rise of classicism in literature. Classicism recognized different registers of language: odes, tragedies, and scholarly writings were written in the high style (ie, the scholarly language; in Ukraine at the time that meant Russian); drama and prose were relegated to the middle style (a mixture of the bookish and the vernacular spoken by clerks and other literate people); and only comedy, burlesque, and travesty were written in the low style (the language of the peasantry; in 'Little Russian,' Ukrainian). Nonetheless, the literature of the Ukrainian baroque had a great influence on Russian literature from the first third of the 17th century up to the mid-18th century. It also had an influence on the Southern Slavs (Mykhail Kozachynsky) and left some traces in Polish literature...

IVAN KOTLIAREVSKY AND THE ORIGINS OF MODERN UKRAINIAN LITERATURE\n\nDuring the 'Cossack period' of Ukrainian literature, which lasted until the end of the 18th century, most Ukrainian literary works were written in the bookish language, which in the 18th century came under the strong influence of the Russian language. While the bookish language (progressively replaced with Russian) was used for works written in the 'high-style' according to Western classicism, vernacular literature began to be used for transposing the high and serious works of antiquity into the 'low' language of the common people. Many verse-travesties have survived from the 18th century by such authors as Ivan Nekrashevych or Opanas Lobysevych. It is in that spirit that the 'father' of Ukrainian vernacular literature, Ivan Kotliarevsky, wrote his famous epic poem, Eneida (1798). He later went on to write two classicist plays of a sentimental type which are considered the earliest examples of modern Ukrainian drama. The most important follower of Ivan Kotliarevsky in the genre of travesty was Petro Hulak-Artemovsky who also attempted to use Ukrainian outside of travesty or burlesque by translating classical Greek poetry into Ukrainian. Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko, the initiator of the Ukrainian short story, was more successful in his attempt to write 'serious' works in the vernacular. As classicism gave way to romanticism its rigid laws were abandoned. At Kharkiv University young scholars imbued with the spirit of romanticism formed a group (Kharkiv Romantic School) and developed new genres by translating and imitating works from other literatures. Among the most prominent members of the Kharkiv group was Levko Borovykovsky, whose contribution to the development of poetic vocabulary made him a precursor of Taras Shevchenko. Most of the authors of the period also wrote in Russian; some did so exclusively: the famous Nikolai Gogol is a prime example...

THE \"RUTHENIAN TRIAD\" AND WESTERN UKRAINIAN NATIONAL REVIVAL\n\nAlthough short-lived, a group of young Galician poets and scholars, established in the 1830s and known as the \"Ruthenian Triad,\" played a decisive role in the Western Ukrainian cultural revival of the 19th century. Comprised by Markiian Shashkevych, Yakiv Holovatsky, and Ivan Vahylevych, the \"Ruthenian Triad\" united around itself other young people who began to research Ukrainian history and culture and actively promote the Ukrainian national cause. The members of the group maintained that the \"Ruthenians\" of Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia were all part of one Ukrainian people who had their own language, culture, and history. The great importance of their literary collection, Rusalka Dnistrovaia (The Dniester Nymph, 1836), was in that it was written in the spoken Ukrainian and not in the \"learned\" yazychiie; it thus initiated the use of vernacular Ukrainian language for literature in the Ukrainian lands in the Habsburg Empire. Because of their populist and national views, the group members suffered harassment by the conservative Ukrainian clergy and Austrian authorities...

TARAS SHEVCHENKO, PANTELEIMON KULISH, AND UKRAINIAN ROMANTICISM\n\nThe first poets in the Ukrainian literature whose works were inspired by the Romantic current of the early 19th century were young scholars and students at Kharkiv University in the 1830s-1840s who formed the co-called Kharkiv Romantic School. Based on their deep interest in Ukrainian folklore, these poets developed new literary genres, translated and imitated works from other literatures, and wholly embraced Johann Gottfried von Herder's idea that Slavic folk poetry was closer to nature and less soiled by corrupt civilization than that of other peoples. However, in the 1840s Kyiv became the center of romanticism in Ukraine. It was at Kyiv University that the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood emerged, which included, among others, Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, and Mykola Kostomarov. Unlike the Kharkiv Romantic School the brotherhood had a definite, if rather utopian, political and national program: it called for a Slavic federation and believed that Ukraine, where the Cossack traditions of freedom and democracy had flourished, would provide the leadership in the federation. Those ideas were incorporated into Knyhy bytiia ukrains'koho narodu (The Books of Genesis of the Ukrainian People), written by Kostomarov. Kostomarov also wrote drama on the Shakespearean model, philosophical poetry, literary criticism, and important historical studies. Another prominent member of the brotherhood, Panteleimon Kulish is noted primarily for his novel-chronicle Chorna rada (The Black Council, 1857), the first historical novel written in Ukrainian. Kulish was also a poet, a translator (of William Shakespeare, the Bible, George Byron, and other world classics), a literary critic, a prominent intellectual, a publisher, and a master of the Ukrainian language. As a poet, overshadowed by Taras Shevchenko but more conscious of his poetic role, Kulish experimented with language (the conscious introduction of Church Slavonic into the Ukrainian vernacular) and with poetic structure and versification (the attempt to domesticate various ancient and canonical strophes). But by far the greatest poet of that group was Taras Shevchenko. Unlike Kulish, Shevchenko was imbued with the Romantic spirit of revolt, and with him Ukrainian romanticism reached its pinnacle. He had the ability to express profound thought in seemingly simple words. With the appearance of his Kobzar (The Minstrel, 1840), and his 'Haidamaky' (The Haidamakas, 1841) Shevchenko dispelled all doubt as to whether the Ukrainian vernacular was suitable for a full-range literature. Shevchenko's poems consist of ballads, Byronic poems, social and political satire, didactic exhortations, and paraphrases of biblical texts. He was popular in his day, and his popularity continued to grow and with it the influence of his poetry. His stature grew to that of Ukraine's national poet...

POPULIST WRITERS IN RUSSIAN-RULED UKRAINE (LATE 19th AND EARLY 20th CENTURY)\n\nPopulist ideals, which began to crystallize in Russia and Ukraine following the Crimean War (1853-56) during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, had a profound impact on Ukrainian literature in the second half of the 19th century. Ukrainian and Russian populists idealized the people (narod), which, practically speaking, meant the peasantry. Russian populism, as ideology, was socially more radical and utopian than Ukrainian populism. Idealizing peasant traditions, especially communal farming, Russian populist thinkers believed that the peasant commune could serve as the foundation of a future socialist Russia. Ukrainian populists, generally known by their contemporaries as Ukrainophiles, were involved primarily in cultural and educational work. The main tenets of Ukrainian populism (narodnytstvo) were federalism, the emancipation of the peasantry, and the recognition of the cultural distinctiveness of the Ukrainian people. Study of the Cossacks induced romantic visions of rebellions against landlords and national oppressors and of the existence of a Cossack republic based on equality and brotherhood. Those ideas, reinforced by the fiery poetry of Taras Shevchenko, inspired a younger generation of Ukrainophiles, some of whom were also influenced by Western European utopian socialists. By the end of the 1870s the leading Ukrainian populist writers, Ivan Nechui-Levytsky and Panas Myrny, had written some of their most important works, and Ivan Franko had made his literary debut in Galicia. Despite the ban on the Ukrainian language in Russian-ruled Ukraine, Ukrainian literature had become established in its own right by the 1880s, that is, during the period when it was most evidently populist in orientation. Treating literary works as effective tools for propagating socio-political ideas, populist writers began to examine new, previously unexplored, themes in Ukrainian literature, such as the role of the intelligentsia and the women's question, in addition to the well-worn theme of the fate of poor village folk. To avoid censorship writers from Russian-ruled Ukraine published extensively in Galicia...

IVAN FRANKO AND THE WESTERN UKRAINIAN POPULISTS AND RADICALS\n\nLike Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko is considered one of Ukraine's most important literary figures. A very prolific writer, poet, publicist, and important political leader, Franko exerted a tremendous influence not only on his native Western Ukraine, but on the Ukrainian culture and national consciousness as a whole. In the last decades of the 19th-century and the first decades of the 20th-century he played a key role in the shaping of the powerful Western Ukrainian populist movement and the formation of Ukrainian radicalism. Although he was an ardent proponent of the realist style in literature and art and was consistently critical of modernist trends, Franko himself did not remain immune to new literary currents and produced (in such collections as Withered Leaves, 1896) one of the first modernist poems in Western Ukraine.

UKRAINIAN MODERNIST WRITERS OF THE LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURY\n\nToward the end of the 19th century the dominant realist style in Ukrainian literature began to give way to various trends of modernism, an international movement in literature and art that emphasized the sense of a radical break with the past and the possibility of a transformed world. Inspired by new works of Western European literatures, some Ukrainian writers no longer aimed for a naturalistic 'copy' of reality, and instead elected impressionist, symbolist, or expressionist modes of writing. Their focus was on subjective perceptions and on the inner psychological conflicts of complex personalities, often belonging to the educated urban intelligentsia. Along with these changes of themes longer realist prose works (novels and novelettes) gave way to lyrical or impressionist short stories. In drama the action passed inward, to explore the psychological conflicts, moods, and experiences of the characters. Poetry abandoned its realistic and didactic orientation in favor of the symbolic; emphasis on content gave way to a fascination with form. The work of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky marks the transition from realism to modernism in the Ukrainian prose. Olha Kobylianska, a woman writer contemporary of Kotsiubynsky, was not so much an impressionist in her manner as a neoromantic. The neoromantic tendency in modernism also prompted a particular rekindling of interest in folklore and resulted in the appearance of a number of remarkable works of literature, including Lesia Ukrainka's play Lisova pisnia (The Song of the Forest, 1911). The master of the very short expressionist story focused on the lives of the peasants was Vasyl Stefanyk. The novelist and dramatist Volodymyr Vynnychenko was deeply interested in the psychological experiences and especially the morality of the intelligentsia. One of the first modernists among Ukrainian poets, Mykola Vorony, consciously opposed the realist and folkloric poetry and introduced the motifs of the city, a subjective mood, and the 'cult of beauty'...

THE MOLODA MUZA AND UKRAINIAN MODERNIST LITERATURE IN WESTERN UKRAINE\n\nToward the end of the 19th century realism in Ukrainian literature started to give way to modernism. Emerging as a rejection of populism, Ukrainian literary modernism championed the idea of creating 'pure art' in the vein of Western European literature of the time. The Lviv-based Moloda Muza group (in Western Ukraine) and the Kyiv-based journal Ukrains'ka khata (in Russian-ruled Ukraine) believed that the necessary modernization of Ukrainian literature required a change in thematic focus from the social to the psychological and the greater sophistication of literary form. The most prominent members of the Moloda Muza were the poets Petro Karmansky, with his end-of-the-century pessimism, and Vasyl Pachovsky, remarkable for his formal diversity. Some members of the group were influenced by its Polish counterpart Mloda Polska. But though they were much less radical than their Polish 'modernist' friends, to say nothing of the Western European symbolists and decadents whose works they often translated, the members of Moloda Muza not only did not receive popular support (their ambitious magazine S'vit had to give up its international profile and turn to more mundane matters after only nine months of publication), they had to contend with attacks from such notables as Serhii Yefremov and Ivan Franko. Franko's criticism, despite his sensitivity to their talent, centered on the absence of proper and meaningful purpose in their creativity. At a time when so much still had to be done in the social, national, and political spheres, there was, according to Franko, little room for the luxury of esthetics. The group members' sensitive brooding was labeled destructive pessimism, their attention to form, needless formalism, and their striking imagery, decadence...

MYKOLA KHVYLOVY, VAPLITE, AND THE UKRAINIAN CULTURAL RENAISSANCE OF THE 1920s\n\nThe downfall of the Russian Empire after the First World War, the resulting abolition of imperial censorship, the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state (even if for a very short time), and the relative leniency of the Soviet regime in the 1920s all led to an astonishing renaissance of literary and cultural activity in Ukraine. Scores of new writers and poets appeared and formed dozens of literary groups that changed the face of Ukrainian literature. Perhaps the most charismatic cultural leader was Mykola Khvylovy, a prominent writer, publicist, and founder of the elitist literary organization Vaplite. Among Vaplite's members were a renowned playwright Mykola Kulish, a brilliant symbolist poet Pavlo Tychyna, an avant-garde poet and writer Maik Yohansen, and such accomplished writers and poets as Yurii Yanovsky, Arkadii Liubchenko, and Mykola Bazhan. However, the Ukrainian cultural renaissance of the 1920s was brutally quashed by Stalinist terror of the 1930s. As a symbolic act of defiance and concern for his nation in the face of the man-made Famine-Genocide of 1932-3 and the growing campaign of political terror, Khvylovy committed suicide in May 1933. The vast majority of Vaplite members, including Kulish and Yohansen, were imprisoned and many were of them executed. Others, including Tychyna, were forced to capitulate to the Soviet regime and begin producing works in the socialist-realist style which glorified Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party. Nonetheless, in a very brief time of relative creative freedom, these writers managed to create a remarkable and lasting literary legacy...

MYKOLA ZEROV AND THE UKRAINIAN NEOCLASSICISTS\n\nThe nucleus of the group of the Ukrainian Neoclassicists of the 1920s consisted of Mykola Zerov, Maksym Rylsky, Pavlo Fylypovych, Mykhailo Drai-Khmara, and Oswald Burghardt (Yurii Klen). They never established a formal organization or program, but they shared cultural and esthetic interests. Mykhailo Mohyliansky, Viktor Petrov, and others are also included in this loose grouping. The group's name is derived from their use of themes and images of antiquity and was given to them by their opponents in the Literary Discussion of 1925-8. The Neoclassicists were self-consciously concerned with the production of high art and disdained 'mass art,' didactic writing, and propagandistic work. Their opponents, in contrast, organized themselves around writers who were supported by the Communist party, and viewed literature in a primarily utilitarian fashion, that is, as a means of strengthening Soviet rule in Ukraine. In the 1930s Mykola Zerov, Pavlo Fylypovych, and Mykhailo Drai-Khmara were sent to Soviet concentration camps and perished there. Maksym Rylsky was forced to publish socialist-realist works, and Burghardt emigrated to the West, where he wrote under the pseudonym Yurii Klen. The tradition of the Neoclassicists was continued among emigre poets, most notably by M. Zerov's brother, Mykhailo Orest...

UKRAINIAN LITERARY AVANT-GARDE OF THE 1910s AND 1920s\n\nAmong the most dynamic and interesting, though often underrated, trends in the Ukrainian literature of the 1910s and 1920s were the urban-oriented, antitraditional, avant-garde movements such as futurism and constructivism. The Ukrainian futurism was intruduced in 1914 by Mykhailo Semenko whose writing abounded with city-life themes and subjects inspired by the Italian futurist Filippo Marinetti, and whose poetry was characterized by experimentation with form and language which attempted to shock the reader. As an active proponent of futurism, Semenko founded several Ukrainian futurist organizations and journals: Fliamingo (1919-21), ASPANFUT (Association of Panfuturists, 1921-4), and, after moving to Kharkiv from Kyiv, Nova Generatsiia (1927-30). A number of talented poets and prose writers belonged to the futurist group: Geo Shkurupii, Oleksa Vlyzko, Mykola Skuba, and the theoretician Oleksii Poltoratsky. The eminent poet Mykola Bazhan and the greatest poet of the Ukrainian revolutionary period, Pavlo Tychyna, were for some time influenced by futurism and utilized some of its ideas in their work. The poet Valeriian Polishchuk was closely associated with futurism and the avant-garde, on the basis of which he tried to build his own movement of 'dynamic spiralism.' The futurists were never as prominent in the Ukrainian literature of their time as the symbolists or Neoclassicists, who never severed their ties with the past. Yet the futurists succeeded in reinvigorating poetry by introducing fresh themes and forms and above all by their experimentation. The group Nova Generatsiia propagated new Western European trends such as Dadaism and surrealism, although this practice conflicted with its journal's official crude sociological declarations. The majority of futurist writers and poets, including Semenko, Shkurupii, and Polishchuk, were executed for 'nationalism' during the Stalinist terror of the 1930s...

THE 'FELLOW TRAVELERS' IN SOVIET UKRAINIAN LITERATURE OF THE 1920s\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1917, the term 'fellow traveler' (Russian: poputchik) was applied in the Soviet Union to writers who seemed to accept the revolution, but who declined to join the Communist Party and were not active participants of Soviet political life. Apart from the group of Ukrainian Neoclassicists, the most prominent 'fellow travelers' in the Soviet Ukrainian literature of the 1920s assembled in a literary organization Lanka, established in 1924 and renamed MARS in 1926. The group included several talented writers of varying literary predilections who were united by their desire to be independent of official politics in the area of literature. They included Valeriian Pidmohylny, Borys Antonenko-Davydovych, Hryhorii Kosynka, Teodosii Osmachka, Yevhen Pluzhnyk, and others. Together with the Neoclassicists, for a long time they continued their opposition to the politicization of literature. They were forced to disband in 1929. Most of the members were executed during the Stalinist terror; Osmachka managed to emigrate at the end of the Second World War, and B. Antonenko-Davydovych was persecuted until his death in Kyiv in 1984. Several other 'fellow travelers,' such as Mykhailo Ivchenko, remained unaffiliated to any literary organizations, but this has not saved them from persecution by the Stalinist regime which took full control over literature in the early 1930s, banned all independent organizations, and proclaimed socialist realism as the sole acceptable literary manner...

THE YIDDISH-LANGUAGE WRITERS OF KYIV'S KULTUR LIGE\n\nIn January 1918, during the period of the Ukrainian Central Rada, a Jewish cultural and social organization called Kultur Lige (Culture League) was founded in Kyiv. The Kultur Lige enjoyed the support of the Ukrainian Ministry of Jewish Affairs under the General Secretariat of the Central Rada as well as of a political coalition that included several Jewish left-wing parties. This organization aimed to cultivate a unique Jewish culture of Ukraine through the creative work in the Yiddish language. Its areas of interest were wide-ranging and covered every aspect of contemporaneous Yiddish culture, including education, literature, theater, art, and music. As such, it played a pivotal role in fostering Jewish cultural and intellectual life in Ukraine during that period. The Kultur Lige had several sections: literature, theatre, painting and sculpture, pre-school, and higher education. Later, at the beginning of 1919, sections for Jewish statistics and archives began operating. The activity of the Kultur Lige peaked in 1919-20, when it organized and supported sixty-three Yiddish schools, fifty-four libraries, and numerous choirs, drama clubs, the Jewish People's University, a Jewish gymnasium, a teachers' seminary, courses for Jewish teachers, the Kultur Lige publishing house, and more. The most prominent Yiddish-language writers in Ukraine of that time, including David Bergelson, David Hofstein, Leib Kvitko, Perets Markish, or Der Nister (Pinkhus Kahanovych), were in one way or another associated with the Kultur Lige. Most of these writers eventually moved to Moscow and later, almost all of them were arrested during the Stalinist post-World War II purges of Jewish culture. On 12 August 1952 virtually all of them were executed in the Lubianka Prison in Moscow during what is sometimes referred to as 'the Night of the Murdered Poets'...

SOCIALIST REALISM IN THE SOVIET UKRAINIAN LITERATURE\n\nThe term socialist realism and its theoretical underpinnings were officially adopted by the First Congress of Writers of the USSR in August 1934, when the Soviet Writers' Union was established. This so-called 'creative method' was imposed by the Stalinist regime during its campaign of terror following the dissolution of all independent literary organizations, as a result of which the Communist Party gained full control over arts and literature in the USSR. As the only officially sanctioned 'method' in Soviet literature and art from the early 1930s, socialist realism demanded 'depiction of reality in its revolutionary development' that 'must be tied to the ideological re-education and training of workers in the spirit of socialism.' In practical terms, this meant that literature and art were to serve as glorifying illustrations of the Communist Party policies, and to portray what was hoped for in such a way that it seemed real. Deviations into truly realistic portrayals of Soviet reality and its deficiencies were attacked as 'slavishness to facts' or 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.' Socialist realism was enforced in literature and the other arts by means of repressions. In the 1930s over 300 writers were executed or otherwise prevented from publishing. The remaining ones were forced to adhere to the officially sanctioned formulaic literary format. Socialist realism remained the only officially-sanctioned style in Ukraine until the late 1980s...

Poet and publicist. Malyshko's first published works appeared in 1930, and his first published collection of poetry was Bat'kivshchyna (The Fatherland, 1936). During the Second World War he was a correspondent of front-line newspapers and published several collections of patriotic poetry. His postwar material includes Za synim morem (Beyond the Blue Sea, 1950), Knyha brativ (The Book of Brothers, 1954), and numerous other collections. The references to internal and international politics and Communist Party directives throughout Malyshko's voluminous canon made him the recipient of various Soviet awards. His works were held out as models of socialist realism and lauded for their populism and adherence to the Party line. In accordance with the prime directive of socialist realism of 'creating for the people' he employed a simplistic lexicon and poetic form and concentrated on the sentimental and patriotic.

THE 'PRAGUE SCHOOL' AND UKRAINIAN NATIONALIST WRITERS OF THE INTERWAR PERIOD\n\nThe term 'Prague school' of Ukrainian poets and writes is used to designate a substantial group of Ukrainian emigre literati, most of whom left Ukraine after the failed Ukrainian struggle for independence of 1917-21. Members of this group espoused nationalist ideology and grouped themselves around Dmytro Dontsov's journal Vistnyk, whether in Lviv (eg, Bohdan Kravtsiv), Prague (eg, Yurii Darahan, Oksana Liaturynska, Leonid Mosendz, Oleksa Stefanovych, Oleh Olzhych, and Olena Teliha), or Warsaw (eg, Yurii Lypa, Nataliia Livytska-Kholodna, and Yevhen Malaniuk). The group included some participants of the Ukrainian cultural renaissance of the 1920s, such as the neocalssicist Yurii Klen (Oswald Burghardt), but was primarily composed of younger writers many of whom were the UNR Army veterans. Their poetry, often written in regular meters and strophes and employing heroic imagery, as well as their prose were aimed chiefly at furthering the struggle for national liberation and expressed this generation's anger and frustration at Ukraine's subjugation by foreign powers and at the defeat of the struggle for independence. Their criticism was directed not only at external forces but also at Ukrainian internal weaknesses, such as the Little Russian mentality, anarchism, and lack of national discipline and organization. Most of these writers were actively involved in the Ukrainian nationalist movement and several of them, including Lypa, Olzhych, and Teliha, lost their lives fighting for independent Ukraine during the Second World War. Learn more about the Ukrainian emigre nationalist poets and writers of the interwar period by visiting the following entries:\n\nLYPA, YURII, b 5 May 1900 in Odesa, d 20 August 1944. Writer and publicist. He was a graduate of Poznan University (1929) and a physician by profession. From 1920 he lived in Poland and Galicia. He died serving as a physician with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. His poetry began to be published in 1919 and several collections of his poetic works appeared. In 1929, together with Yevhen Malaniuk, Lypa established the literary group Tank in Warsaw and became the group's main ideologist. His prose works include a novel, three volumes of short stories, and a collection of essays. He wrote a number of publicist works which were popular at the time and in which he outlined his so-called Black Sea doctrine; and numerous publicistic articles and essays of literary criticism. Lypa's 'imperial' concept was not well-founded but it was expounded in such a brilliant and stirring style that he became one of the most popular figures of his time in Galicia and among Ukrainian emigrants. His medical works were reprinted several times and enjoyed great popularity...\n\nYurii Lypa\n\nMALANIUK, YEVHEN, b 20 January 1897 in Novoarkhanhelsk, Olviopil county, Kherson gubernia, d 16 February 1968 in New York. Poet and political and community activist. He became an officer of the Army of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1917 and was interned in Kalisz, Poland, in 1920. He graduated from the Ukrainian Husbandry Academy in Podebrady in 1923. Toward the end of the Second World War he resettled in Germany, and then he emigrated to the United States. His poetry is one of the better examples of the literary resurgence of the 1920s and 1930s. He was a member of the vistnykivtsi, made up of literary contributors to Dmytro Dontsov's journal Vistnyk. His work was influential in emigre circles, in Western Ukraine, and in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, where he was under constant attack by official critics. The style and engaged content of his poetry emerged as a result of his generation's anger and frustration at Ukraine's subjugation, at the defeat of the struggle for independence (1917-20), and at the ongoing tragedy caused by Moscow's domination of Ukraine...\n\nYevhen Malaniuk\n\nOLZHYCH, OLEH, b 8 July 1907 in Zhytomyr, Volhynia, d 9 June 1944 in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Archeologist, poet, and nationalist leader; son of Oleksander Oles. Olzhych emigrated from Ukraine in 1923 and lived in Prague, where he graduated with a degree in archeology from Charles University in 1929. After a brief lecture tour at Harvard University Olzhych helped found the short-lived Ukrainian Research Institute in America (Saint Paul, Minnesota) and edited its first collection of papers (1939). In 1929 Olzhych joined the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and headed its cultural and educational branch. After the split in the OUN in 1940, he went with the Melnykites. As second-in-command to Andrii Melnyk he represented the OUN leadership in Carpatho-Ukraine (1938-9) and took part in forming the Ukrainian National Council in 1941. Until his arrest and execution by the Gestapo, he directed Melnykite underground activities in Ukraine. Often relying on historical themes to illustrate the inalienable right of Ukraine to independent statehood, Olzhych's verse typifies the nationalist poetry between the two world wars...\n\nOleh Olzhych\n\nTELIHA, OLENA, b 21 July 1907 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, d 21 February 1942 in Kyiv. Poet, publicist, and nationalist leader. Teliha emigrated with her parents to Czechoslovakia in 1922, where she studied at the Ukrainian Higher Pedagogical Institute in Prague. The intellectual milieu of the Ukrainian emigres after the failure of the Ukrainian struggle for independence (1917-20) and especially the Ukrainian student life in Prague in the 1930s had a profound influence on Teliha's development. From 1933 she contributed to the nationalist journal Vistnyk. In Cracow from 1939 to 1941, she headed the literary-artistic society Zarevo and together with Oleh Olzhych worked in the cultural sector of the Leadership of Ukrainian Nationalists. With the outbreak of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union she moved to Lviv and then left with the OUN expeditionary groups for Kyiv in 1941. There she became editor of the literary weekly Litavry. When the Nazi regime closed down Litavry's parent newspaper, Ukrains'ke slovo, and replaced it with a pro-regime organ, Teliha refused to co-operate. She was arrested by the Gestapo and executed...\n\nOlena Teliha\n\nMOSENDZ, LEONID, b 20 September 1897 in Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Podilia gubernia, d 13 October 1948 in Blonay, Switzerland. Writer. A demobilized Army of the Ukrainian National Republic soldier, he fled to Poland in 1920. He returned to Lutsk in 1921, whereupon he was arrested by the Poles and sent to an internment camp in Kalisz. After his release he studied chemical engineering at the Ukrainian Husbandry Academy in Podebrady where he received a doctorate in 1931 and worked as a civil engineer in Bratislava, whence he fled in 1945 to the British zone in Austria. He died in a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium. From the late 1920s Mosendz contributed poetry, prose, literary criticism, and book reviews to Ukrainian periodicals, including the journal Vistnyk. His unfinished novel The Last Prophet was published posthumously in 1960. The principal themes of Mosendz's works, including his publicistic pamphlets about the Prussian statesman Baron K. Stein (1935) and Mykola Khvylovy (1948), derive from his well-developed sense of Ukrainian patriotism...\n\nLeonid Mosendz\n\nSTEFANOVYCH, OLEKSA, , b 5 October 1899 in Myliatyn, Ostrih county, Volhynia gubernia, d 4 January 1970 in Buffalo, New York. Poet. As an interwar emigre he studied at Prague University (1922-8; PH D diss on Amvrosii Metlynsky as a poet, 1932) and the Ukrainian Free University (1928-30). His poetry appeared in Ukrainian journals in Prague, Lviv, and Chernivtsi and was published in Prague in two collections. Although Stefanovych belonged to the 'Prague school' of Ukrainian poets, the voluntarism characteristic of the works of its other members is absent in his poems. His creativity was inspired by elegiac memories of Volhynia's landscapes, by Ukrainian historical and mythological figures, and by tragic events in Ukraine's past and present. Paganism (with erotic overtones) and, in his later poems, Christianity (often of the mystical variety) were dominant forces in his oeuvre. His style is notable for the originality of his poetic language, with its archaisms, neologisms, and unique use of syntax...\n\nOleksa Stefanovych\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries featuring the 'Prague school' of the interwar Ukrainian nationalist poets and writers were made possible by the financial support of the MICHAEL KOWALSKY AND DARIA MUCAK-KOWALSKY ENCYCLOPEDIA ENDOWMENT FUND at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (Edmonton, AB, Canada).\n\nXVIII. THE 'MINOR RENAISSANCE' OF UKRAINIAN LITERATURE IN THE 1940s\n\nImmediately after World War II, in the second half of the 1940s, Ukrainian literature outside of Soviet Ukraine experienced an unusually intensive period of development in the displaced persons' camps in western Germany and Austria. These camps, which had become home to over 200,000 Ukrainian war refugees, including a significant number of writers and literary scholars, represented a hub of fervent cultural activity, so much so that the period 1945-1949 is often referred to by scholars as the 'minor renaissance' of Ukrainian literature. Thrown together from various regions of Ukraine, writers managed to replay on a small scale the activity of the 1920s. They convened congresses, organized literary associations, and published almanacs, journals, and books. A key role in the period's most important literary organization, MUR, was played by the linguist, scholar, and literary critic, George Yurii Shevelov and the novelist Ulas Samchuk. Other most notable members of MUR included the dramatist, prose writer, essayist, and publisher Ihor Kostetsky; the writer and scholar Viktor Petrov (V. Domontovych), the politically ambivalent Yurii Kosach, and the poet Vasyl Barka. This 'minor renaissance' of Ukrainian literature came to an end in the early 1950s as the majority of the authors emigrated to North America and continued their literary work there... Learn more about the Ukrainian literature written in the 1940s in the displaced persons' camps by visiting the following entries:\n\nMUR. (Mystetskyi ukrainskyi rukh [The Artistic Ukrainian Movement]). An artistic-literary organization of Ukrainian emigres in Europe. It was founded on 25 September 1945 in Furth, Germany, on the initiative of a committee consisting of Ivan Bahriany, V. Domontovych (Viktor Petrov), Yurii Kosach, Ihor Kostetsky, Ivan Maistrenko, and Yu. Sherekh (George Yurii Shevelov). MUR organized three writers' congresses (1945, 1947, and 1948) as well as three conferences devoted to various aspects of literary activity. The head of the organization during its whole duration was Ulas Samchuk, and its membership numbered 61. The objectives of MUR were to gather Ukrainian writers scattered by the Second World War, to organize the publication of their works, and to become a center for creative dialogues among members representing various styles and literary aims. MUR managed to organize almost all of the noted emigre writers and provide them with a forum for discussion while it stimulated an interest in literature among the public at large...\n\nMUR\n\nSHEVELOV, GEORGE YURII (pseud: Yurii Sherekh), b 17 December 1908 in Kharkiv, d 12 April 2002 in New York. Slavic linguist, philologist, essayist, literary historian, and literary critic; full member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society since 1949 and of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1945. After studying under Leonid Bulakhovsky at Kharkiv University (candidate 1939) he lectured there in Slavic linguistics (1939-43). Having emigrated to Germany, he taught at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich (1946-9) and obtained a doctorate there (1949). He was also vice-president of the MUR literary association (1945-9). After settling in the United States he served as lecturer in Russian and Ukrainian at Harvard University (1952-4), associate professor (1954-8) and professor of Slavic philology at Columbia University (1958-77), and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences (1959-61, 1981-6). He was a founding member of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile...\n\nGeorge Yurii Shevelov\n\nSAMCHUK, ULAS, b 20 February 1905 in Derman, Ostrih county, Volhynia gubernia, d 9 July 1987 in Toronto. Writer and journalist. Samchuk was educated at the University of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) and at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague (1931). His literary career began in 1926. He was editor of the Rivne newspaper Volyn' (1941-3), and he fled to Germany in 1944, where he headed the literary-artistic organization MUR (1945-8). He emigrated to Canada after 1948 and became a longtime head of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile. Samchuk's prose is deeply rooted in the 19th-century realist tradition. His novels are broad-canvas chronicles of the Ukrainian experience in the 20th century. Themes progress from the difficult national and cultural nascence in the trilogy Volyn' (Volhynia, 1932, 1935, 1937), the devastating Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932-33 in Mariia (1934), and the Second World War and forced Ukrainian labor in the trilogy Ost (East, 1948, 1957, 1982)...\n\nUlas Samchuk\n\nKOSTETSKY, IHOR (Kostetzky, Eaghor G.; pen name of Ihor Merzliakov), b 14 May 1913 in Kyiv, d 14 June 1983 in Schwaikheim, West Germany. Writer, playwright, translator, critic, and publisher. He grew up in Kyiv and Vinnytsia. In the 1930s he studied stage directing and acting in Leningrad and Moscow. A postwar refugee in Germany, he was one of the founders of the writers' association MUR. In the 1950s and 1960s he edited an illustrated journal Ukraina i svit. He and his wife, the German poet Elizabeth Kottmeier, established the Na Hori publishing house in the mid 1950s and, over the period of twenty five years, published several dozen books, including some outstanding editions of the world literary classics in the Ukrainian translation. Kostetsky published prolifically during the late 1940s. His prose works combined traditional and modernist (expressionist, surrealist, dadaist) forms of expression. His experimental plays written in the 1940s anticipated many stylistic devices subsequently mastered by such dramatists as Samuel Beckett...\n\nIhor Kostetsky\n\nPETROV, VIKTOR (pseud: V. Domontovych, V. Ber), b 22 October 1894 in Katerynoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk), d 8 June 1969 in Kyiv. Writer, literary scholar, archeologist, and ethnographer; member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. A graduate of Kyiv University (1918), from 1920 he worked for the Ethnographic Commission of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. During the 1920s he also worked as a literary scholar and writer and was close to the Neoclassicists. In 1941 he was briefly director of the Institute of Ukrainian Folklore of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1944 he fled to the West. As a refugee in postwar Munich he was a professor at the Ukrainian Free University and a member of the editorial boards of the literary and art monthly Arka and the MUR collections. In 1949 he 'reappeared' in the USSR and worked at the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. From 1956 he was a senior associate of the Institute of Archeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in Kyiv and the custodian of its scientific archive...\n\nViktor Petrov\n\nKOSACH, YURII, b 5 December 1909 in Kyiv, d 10 January 1990 in Passaic, New Jersey. Poet, writer, and dramatist; nephew of Lesia Ukrainka. Kosach studied at Warsaw University and in Paris. After the war he lived in displaced persons camps in Germany and was an active member of the writers' organization MUR. In 1949 he immigrated to the United States. While in New York he began publishing a pro-Soviet journal, Za synim obriiem, which was notable primarily for its strident anti-emigre attacks. A prolific author excelling in the genre of the historical novel, he is also the author of several collections of rather average poetry, often marked by his interest in history and mythology. His dramatic works include Obloha (The Siege, 1943)--a dramatic poem--and the tragedy Diistvo pro Iuriia Peremozhtsia (Play about Yurii the Conqueror, 1947). By far the largest and most interesting body of work is Kosach's prose, written prior to his emigration to the United States...\n\nYurii Kosach\n\nBARKA, VASYL (pseud of Vasyl Ocheret), b 16 July 1908 in the village of Solonytsia near Lubni, Poltava gubernia, d 11 April 2003 in Liberty, New York State. Poet, writer, literary critic, translator. An emigre from 1943, he lived in Germany, where he was active in the MUR literary association, before settling in the United States in 1949. Barka's orphic works require intuitive rather than logical comprehension. His poetry developed and grew in stature, from the early lyrical collections to the monumental 4,000-strophe epic novel in verse Svidok dlia sontsia shestykrylykh (The Witness for the Sun of Seraphims, 1981), addressed to the theme of reconciliation between 'man and the Creator.' His first novel, Rai (Paradise, 1953), deals with the Soviet 'paradise.' His second novel, Zhovtyi kniaz' (The Yellow Prince, 1962, 1968), about the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932-33, was translated into French (Paris 1981) and served as the basis for Oles Yanchuk's 1993 Ukrainian feature film Holod-33 (Famine-33)...\n\nVasyl Barka\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries featuring the Ukrainian literature's 'minor renaissance' in the 1940s were made possible by the financial support of the CANADIAN FOUNDATION FOR UKRAINIAN STUDIES.\n\nXIX. THE NEW YORK GROUP AND POSTWAR EMIGRE MODERNIST LITERATURE\n\nIn the mid-1950s, a new generation of Ukrainian emigre poets and writers appeared in the West to complement the older generation of Ukrainian literary figures who left both Soviet and Western Ukraine during the Second World War. Eager to modernize Ukrainian literature, the most prominent of these young literati, who established an informal New York Group, rejected the nationalist poetry of their predecessors and were searching for a new synthesis and expression capable of absorbing their peculiar situation as permanent emigres. The New York Group was never united by any artistic credo or manifesto. More a grouping of friends than an organization, it embraced Ukrainians who began their period of creativity in North America, who happened to be living (in most cases, only temporarily) in New York. In form their poetry ranged from the surrealism of Emma Andiievska and the depoeticized verse of George Tarnawsky to the more traditional quatrains of Bohdan Boychuk, Bohdan Rubchak, and Vira Vovk although most of the members of the initial group had experienced similar influences (Jean-Paul Sartre, Federico Garcia Lorca, Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Pablo Neruda), had a common emigre heritage, which at times encouraged in them a preoccupation with the purity of the Ukrainian language, and were united in a desire to distance themselves from the overly nationalistic poetry of the previous generation. Their creativity provided a much-needed revitalization of the emigre Ukrainian literature after the war and probably served also as an impetus for the shistdesiatnyky poets in Ukraine and, more notably, for the next generation of poets, including the so-called Kyiv School... Learn more about the New York Group and postwar Ukrainian emigre modernist writers by visiting the following entries:\n\nNEW YORK GROUP. A group of poets and artists, which developed spontaneously in the mid-1950s from informal friendships and discussions around the Students'ke slovo (Student Word) supplement to the newspaper Svoboda. The initiating core consisted of Bohdan Boychuk and George Tarnawsky. In 1954 the group grew to include, for some time, several Ukrainian artists, such as Bohdan Pevny, Yaroslava Gerulak, and Jurij Solovij. It organized art exhibitions and poetry readings. Five other poets joined Boychuk and Tarnawsky in the late 1950s to form the core of the initial New York Group: Bohdan Rubchak, Zhenia Vasylkivska, Emma Andiievska, Patritsiia Kylyna (Patricia Warren), and Vira Vovk. The name New York Group, chosen because its most active members lived in the New York area, was applied to the group from 1958, when they decided to start a serial publication, Novi poezii. The name was also used for a publishing house, which published many of the collections of the individual members. In 1965 three other poets, Yurii Kolomyiets, Oleh Koverko, and Marco Carynnyk, published their poems in Novi poezii and became associated with the group. In 1969 the group grew to include Roman Baboval from Belgium. Following a period of inactivity in the 1970s, the group was revitalized in 1984-85 and joined by Maria Rewakowicz. Between 1990 and 1999 Boychuk and Rewakowicz, in cooperation with the Writers' Union of Ukraine, published a literary journal Svito-vyd in Kyiv...\n\nNew York Group\n\nBOYCHUK, BOHDAN, b 11 October 1927 in the village of Bortnyky, Buchach county, Galicia. Poet, cofounder and member of the New York Group, writer, literary critic, and translator. An Ostarbeiter in Nazi Germany and postwar refugee, he lived in displaced persons camps in Germany until 1949, when he immigrated to the United States and settled in New York. An active member of the Ukrainian emigre cultural community, he was cofounder and coeditor of the New York Group's serial publication Novi poezii and the main organizer of the group's publishing house. He was also an editor of literature (between 1961 and 1973) of the journal Suchasnist', and a cofounder and coeditor of the literary journal Svito-vyd in Kyiv (1990-99). Boychuk published numerous collections of modernist poetry, strongly influenced by the philosophy of Existentialism. His is also an author of several novels and prose collections, a collection of drama, and a book of memoirs. Boychuk has translated Spanish and American poetry into Ukrainian, Ukrainian poetry (the poetry of Bohdan Ihor Antonych and Ivan Drach) into English, and has edited several anthologies and books of Ukrainian poetry (including collected works of Oleksa Stefanovych and Bohdan Kravtsiv), memoirs (of the actor and theater director Yosyp Hirniak), and books on Ukrainian emigre artists...\n\nBohdan Boychuk\n\nTARNAWSKY, GEORGE, b 3 February 1934 in Turka, Sambir county, Galicia. Linguist, poet, novelist, and translator. Tarnawsky was displaced by the Second World War, and grew up in a displaced persons camp in Neu Ulm, Germany. He emigrated to the United States in 1952 and completed a degree in electrical engineering and then turned to linguistics, in which discipline he was awarded a PH D from New York University in 1982. He worked at IBM on automated language-translation projects and artificial intelligence and published a number of scientific papers on those subjects. In his early poetry Tarnawsky was influenced by the French pre-Symbolists and Surrealists, as well as modern Spanish-language poets and by the philosophy of Existentialism. His linguistic studies and computer work have had a profound influence on him as a writer. In his poetry as well as in his prose he has eschewed the more usual embellished language and has sought the utmost semantic and syntactic directness, as if his creations were to enter into a one-to-one computerized relationship between word and meaning. Tarnawsky is unique in his expression, and his poems reflect well the mechanized and dehumanized contemporary world. He has published several collections of verse and Ukrainian-language prose as well as a book of drama. He is also the author of English-language prose works. Tarnawsky was the cofounder and editor of the group's periodic publication Novi poezii (1959-71)...\n\nGeorge Tarnawsky\n\nRUBCHAK, BOHDAN, b 6 March 1935 in Kalush, Galicia. Poet and literary scholar. In 1948, after being displaced by the Second World War, Rubchak settled in the United States. He studied comparative literature at Rutgers University in New Jersey (PH D, 1977) and between 1974 and 2005 was a professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle. A member of the New York Group, Rubchak published five collections of poetry and a volume of collected works. His lyrical poetry is introspective and marked by classical restraint and an intellectual atmosphere enhanced by his literary erudition. His short stories are gifted but too sporadic, and his prose consists mainly of literary criticism. Numerous essays in both English and Ukrainian have appeared in various journals and reveal that he is a very knowledgeable, incisive, and eloquent critic of Ukrainian poetry, individual poets, modernism, and emigre Ukrainian literature. Of special note are his comprehensive introduction to Ukrainian modernism in the book of works by Ostap Lutsky, his annotations of and introduction to Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky in the translation of Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1981), and his notes to the edition of collected works by Bohdan Ihor Antonych (1967). Together with Bohdan Boychuk he edited and wrote biographical-critical vignettes for the important two-volume anthology of contemporary Ukrainian poetry in the West Koordynaty (Co-ordinates, 1969)...\n\nBohdan Rubchak\n\nVOVK, VIRA (pseudonym of Vira Selianska), b 2 January 1926 in Boryslav, Drohobych county, Galicia. Writer, literary scholar, and translator. Having been forced to emigrate by the Second World War, Vovk studied German language and literature in Germany, at Tubingen University and Munich University (1945-9), and completed her studies with a doctorate in 1950 at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she remained as a lecturer and, in 1968-80, professor of comparative literature. From 1980 she taught at the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro. Vovk writes in three genres: poetry, prose, and drama. The most voluminous is her poetic output. Her poetry, which began as often derivative, formally unsophisticated lyricism, developed in her later collections into the highly complex and rhythmical free verse of her 'elegies' and the intricate multirhythms of her 'ballads', in which she mixes dialogue with narration and bilingual texts. Two major motifs flow through her poetry, exotic geography (the result of displacement) and religious mysticism. The interest in mysticism and myth carries over into her less-voluminous prose and her poetic drama. Many of her publications, from the 1970s on, are exquisite esthetic productions with hand-inserted illustrations by Ukrainian artists or Vovk's own paper cutouts. Vovk has devoted a great deal of time to translation into Ukrainian and into Portuguese and German...\n\nVira Vovk\n\nANDIIEVSKA, EMMA (or ANDIJEWSKA), b 19 March 1931 in Staline (now Donetsk). Poetess, prose writer, and painter. An emigre since 1943, she at first lived in Germany, then in France and the United States, and now again lives in Germany. Initially associated with the New York Group of poets, Andiievska later distanced herself from the group. Andiievska's work is highly original. To date she has published nearly thirty collections of verse, five collections of short prose, and three novels. The reaction of literary critics to Andiievska's works has been mixed and even contradictory. Very highly praised by prominent literary scholars, she was harshly criticised by others who attacked her work for its incomprehensibility. The hermeticism of her poetry (in particular, her complex and non-traditional sonnets with consonant rhymes) and the self-imposed and strictly adhered-to structural constraints of her prose do not lend themselves to easy comprehension. Andiievska's poetic world consists of surrealistic landscapes rooted in real descriptions of nature, which the poet views from various dimensions and to which she provides exquisite instrumentation. The multidimensional imagery produces an effect of simultaneity of events, coinciding with the notion of 'round time', whose laws govern her multiepisodic but monolinear (chainlike) novels. Andiievska's poetry is often meditative and metaphysical in its imagery, exhibiting elements of surrealism and affinity to Far Eastern philosophical doctrines, such as Zen Buddhism...\n\nEmma Andiievska (Andijewska)\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries about the New York Group and postwar Ukrainian emigre modernist writers were made possible by the financial support of the CANADIAN FOUNDATION FOR UKRAINIAN STUDIES.\n\nXX. SHISTDESIATNYKY: THE LITERARY GENERATION OF THE POST-STALINIST THAW IN UKRAINE\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the 'de-Stalinization' speech by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, the controls over literature in the Soviet Union began to slacken. The film director Oleksander Dovzhenko initiated the post-Stalinist 'thaw' in Ukrainian literature with the publication of his autobiographical novelette Zacharovana Desna (The Enchanted Desna, 1957). The process of rehabilitation of some of the authors destroyed in the 1930s began slowly. The rediscovery of the 1920s had a profound influence on the generation that was born just before or during the Second World War and began publishing in the 1960s. The so-called shistdesiatnyky (the Sixtiers) succeeded in a span of 10 years in revitalizing all genres of Soviet Ukrainian literature. Characteristic of shistdesiatnyky poetry was the renewal of poetic forms and subjects, which had been stamped out by the dogma of socialist realism. The prose of the group was characterized by realistic descriptions free of the constraints of socialist realism, witty humor or sharp satire, subtle delineation of the motives of protagonists, and an interest in historical subjects. However, the shistdesiatnyky movement lasted barely a decade. The writers concerned were harshly criticized and then completely silenced by the arrests of 1965-72. During the course of those repressions some individual writers went over to the official position without having offered particular resistance; some of them were denied permission to publish, or refused to do so for some time; others, who continued to oppose national discrimination and Russification and joined the ranks of the Ukrainian dissident movement, were arrested and punished with long prison sentences... Learn more about the shistdesiatnyky by visiting the following entries:\n\nSHISTDESIATNYKY (also Shestydesiatnyky; The Sixtiers). The literary generation that began to publish in the second half of the 1950s, during Nikita Khrushchev's 'de-Stalinization,' and reached their literary peak in the early 1960s; hence, their name. The first representatives were Lina Kostenko and Vasyl Symonenko. Following their lead came a veritable proliferation of poets: Ivan Drach, Mykola Vinhranovsky, H. Kyrychenko, Vasyl Holoborodko, Ihor Kalynets, B. Mamaisur, and others. At first Vitalii Korotych was close to the group. The more prominent prose writers were Valerii Shevchuk, Hryhir Tiutiunnyk, Volodymyr Drozd, Yevhen Hutsalo, and Yaroslav Stupak, and literary critics, Ivan Dziuba, Yevhen Sverstiuk, Ivan Svitlychny, and I. Boichak. The shistdesiatnyky held their 'literary parents' responsible for Stalinist crimes, for adapting to a despotic regime, and for creative impotence (eg, Drach in 'Oda chesnomu boiahuzovi' [Ode to an Honest Coward]). In turn, some of the older writers, such as Pavlo Tychyna, Platon Voronko, Mykola Sheremet, and Mykhailo Chabanivsky, exhibited a hostile attitude to the experimentation and innovation of the shistdesiatnyky...\n\nShistdesiatnyky\n\nSYMONENKO, VASYL, b 8 January 1935 in Biivtsi, Lubny raion, Poltava oblast, d 13 December 1963 in Cherkasy. Poet, journalist, and dissident. He graduated with a degree in journalism from Kyiv University in 1957. Symonenko began writing poetry while a student, but because of the harsh environment of Soviet censorship he published little. Only one collection of his poetry appeared during his lifetime, Tysha i hrim (Silence and Thunder, 1962). His poetry, however, was popular and was widely circulated in samvydav, and it largely marks the beginning of the Ukrainian opposition movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Thematically, his verse consists of satires on the Soviet regime, descriptions of the difficult life of the peasantry, condemnations of Soviet despotism, and protestations against Russian chauvinism. Of particular importance is a cycle of poems in which the poet speaks of his love for Ukraine. In the first decade following Symonenko's death Soviet literary criticism attempted to paralyze the influence of his samvydav poetry, by suppressing it and simultaneously praising it as 'irreproachably devoted to the Communist Party line...'\n\nVasyl Symonenko\n\nKOSTENKO, LINA, b 19 March 1930 in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv oblast. Poet; one of the earliest and most outstanding of the shistdesiatnyky. Her first poems were published in the early 1950s. She published three poetry collections by 1961. Her collection 'Zorianyi integral' (The Stellar Integral) was ready for publication in 1962, but the censors judged it ideologically harmful and a departure from socialist realism and suppressed it. In 1965 and 1968 Kostenko signed several open letters protesting the arrests and secret trials of Ukrainian intellectuals. Her poetry was not published in Ukraine again until 1977, when her collection Nad berehamy vichnoi riky (On the Banks of the Eternal River) appeared. A novel in verse, Marusia Churai (1979) and the collection Nepovtornist' (Uniqueness, 1980) followed and earned its author the Shevchenko Prize in 1987. In 1987 Kostenko published her next collection Sad netanuchykh skul'ptur (Garden of Unthawed Sculptures). Her historical novel in verse Berestechko, originally composed in 1966, appeared in book form only in 1999. Kostenko's poetry consists primarily of intimate, lyric poems and 'social' poems on the role and responsibility of a poet, particularly in a totalitarian society...\n\nLina Kostenko\n\nDRACH, IVAN, b 17 October 1936 in Telizhyntsi, Kyiv oblast. Poet, screenwriter, and political leader. Drach studied at Kyiv University (1958-61) and completed advanced scriptwriting courses in Moscow in 1964. His works have appeared in print since 1959. Drach stood at the forefront of the Ukrainian literary revival initiated by the shistdesiatnyky. His early poetry was noted for its originality, fresh imagery, complex metaphors, philosophical meditation, neologisms, and varied rhythm. He was criticized sharply for his departure from the canons of socialist realism, especially in the poem 'Nizh u sontsi' (Knife in the Sun, 1961), and for the satirical poem 'Oda chesnomu boiahuzevi' (Ode to an Honest Coward, 1963). He compromised with the regime in the late 1960s, and this proved detrimental to the quality of his later work. In the 1970s and 1980s he traveled abroad as an official Soviet cultural emissary. In the late 1980s Drach emerged as a prominent political activist in Ukraine. As head of the Kyiv organization of the Writers' Union of Ukraine he was instrumental in forging the coalition that created the Popular Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)...\n\nIvan Drach\n\nVINHRANOVSKY, MYKOLA, b 7 November 1936 in Bohopil, now part of Pervomaisk (Mykolaiv oblast), d 26 May 2004 in Kyiv. Writer, actor, film director, and translator. He graduated from the All-Union Institute of Cinematography (1960) in Moscow and has worked at the Kyiv Artistic Film Studio, where he played the lead role in Yuliia Solntseva's film Povist' polumianykh lit (The Tale of Flaming Years, 1961). He wrote film scripts and directed the feature films Eskadra povertaie na zakhid (The Squadron Turns Westward, 1967), Bereh nadii (The Shore of Hope, 1967), Duma pro Brytanku (Duma about Brytanka, 1969), and Klymko (1984) and several documentaries. Vinhranovsky gained prominence in the early 1960s as a leading poet of the shistdesiatnyky. He published nine poetry collections, several books of short stories, the novel Nalyvaiko (1991), and, from 1970, several poetry books for children, for which he was awarded the Shevchenko Prize in 1984...\n\nMykola Vinhranovsky\n\nDZIUBA, IVAN, b 26 July 1931 in Mykolaivka, Volnovakha raion, Donetsk oblast. Literary scholar, publicist, and a former Ukrainian dissident and government minister; full member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NANU) since 1992. Dziuba was one of the spokespersons of the shistdesiatnyky and expressed the aspirations of the postwar generation of Soviet Ukrainian writers to revitalize Ukrainian literature and liberate it from the influence of Russian literature. In the 1960s he became active in the movement against Russification and the persecution of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. Late in 1965 he completed his main work, Internatsionalizm chy rusyfikatsiia? (Internationalism or Russification?). In it he demonstrated how the Soviet regime had departed from the theoretical principles of Leninist nationality policy and had been Russifying Ukraine and destroying its society and intelligentsia under the pretext of internationalism. In January 1972 Dziuba was arrested and later sentenced to five years' imprisonment; he was released after he wrote a public recantation of his views...\n\nIvan Dziuba\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries featuring the literary legacy of the shistdesiatnyky were made possible by the financial support of the CANADIAN FOUNDATION FOR UKRAINIAN STUDIES.\n\nXXI. UKRAINIAN DISSIDENT WRITERS OF THE 1960s TO 1980s\n\nThe dissident movement came into existence in the USSR after the death of Joseph Stalin. It protested against violations of the law by organs of the state and demanded national and human rights. In Ukraine, as in other republics of the USSR where national oppression was keenly felt, the dissident movement represented a struggle against the violation of the republic's rights of sovereignty by the central government and the Communist Party, a resistance to colonization by foreign elements, and a protest against the destruction of cultural monuments, the falsification of the history of Ukraine, and generally against the policies of Russification. In Ukraine de-Stalinization saw the emergence in the 1960s of young and talented prose writers, poets, artists, and intellectuals known as the shistdesiatnyky. As harbingers of the idea of creative freedom, these individuals became symbols of the Ukrainian national renaissance. However, dissident activities in Ukraine constantly elicited repressive measures on the part of the regime. The first extensive wave of arrests and trials took place in 1965-6. The second wave occurred between January and April 1972, when many of the prominent shistdesiatnyky writers, scholars, and artists who refused to conform to the government pressure and accept the strictures of Communist Party control were arrested and imprisoned. They included Yevhen Sverstiuk, Ivan Svitlychny, Nadiia Svitlychna, Mykhailo Osadchy, Mykola Horbal, Nina Strokata, Vasyl Stus, Stefaniia Shabatura, Ihor Kalynets, Iryna Kalynets, and many others. They were tried for 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' and given harsh prison sentences. Banned by the Party censorship, their literary works could appear only in the illegal samvydav (samizdat) editions or be smuggled abroad and published by emigre publishing houses. Most dissident writers were active in protests and hunger strikes in the Soviet prison camps; many became members of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group whose purpose was to monitor the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Accords, signed in August 1975: freedom of conscience, the free flow of information, and freedom of travel. Some writers, including the prominent poet Vasyl Stus, died in a prison camp of the Gulag...

Poet, literary critic, human rights activist, and dissident. After graduating in philology from Kharkiv University in 1952, he worked as an editor of the journal Radians'ke literaturoznavstvo, a research associate of the Institute of Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, and a researcher in the dictionary department of the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1965 he was fired from his job and arrested for his 'nationalistic' activities, namely, smuggling abroad Vasyl Symonenko's poems. After eight months in prison he was released. In 13 January 1972 he was arrested for contributing to and distributing samvydav literature and was sentenced to seven years' hard labor and five years' internal exile. He was seriously ill in labor camp and suffered two strokes during exile. Upon his release in 1984 he returned to Kyiv permanently crippled. Svitlychny's critical articles began to appear in journals when he was still a student. In his early works on literary theory he rejected the application of philosophical concepts to the study of esthetics and literature. He was closely identified with the shistdesiatnyky in the 1960s, and devoted much attention to their work. He translated Czech, Slovak, and French poetry and Slovo o polku Ihorevi into Ukrainian. During imprisonment and exile he wrote poetry, some of which has appeared in the West...\n\nIvan Svitlychny\n\nSTUS, VASYL, b 8 January 1938 in Rakhnivka, Haisyn raion, Vinnytsia oblast, d 4 September 1985 in Soviet strict-regime concentration camp no. 389/36-1, Perm oblast, RSFSR. Dissident poet. Stus studied at the Donetsk Pedagogical Institute and began his graduate work at the Institute of Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in 1964. A year later, because of his protests against the secret arrests and closed trials which were becoming prevalent, he was expelled from the institute, and in 1972 he was arrested. He was sentenced to five years of strict-regime labor camp followed by three years of exile. While in exile he joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, and for that he was rearrested in 1980 and sentenced to 10 years of strict-regime labor camp and 5 years of exile. A man of uncompromising principles, Stus refused to kowtow to the regime and was subjected to constant persecutions, which finally were responsible for his death. Stus began writing poetry as a student. Because of his activities in the dissident movement, his first collection of poems was not printed. Although he continued to write while he was incarcerated, the KGB systematically confiscated and destroyed his work. Up to 600 poems and translations were destroyed in 1976. Some poems miraculously survived and were smuggled out to the West, where Stus's poetry appeared in several collections. Traditional in form, Stus's poetry began as 'lyricism of actuality.' His poetry written behind bars, however, is more meditative and philosophical; it expresses a longing, philosophical contemplation of life, nature, man the prisoner, and man the jailer, and reveals Stus's attempt to come to some synthesis with respect to the contradictions of the human experience...\n\nVasyl Stus\n\nOSADCHY, MYKHAILO, b 22 March 1936 in Kurmany, now in Nedryhailiv raion, Sumy oblast, d 5 July 1994 in Lviv. Poet, writer, and dissident; honorary member of the Swiss section of the PEN International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists from 1979. He graduated with a degree in journalism from Lviv University (1958), where he taught (1960-5) and then completed postgraduate studies (1965). He became active in the Ukrainian dissident movement in the mid-1960s. Osadchy was arrested in 1965 for anti-Soviet activity and sentenced in 1966 to two years' imprisonment. In 1972 he was arrested again and sentenced to seven years of strict-regime labor camp and three years of exile. He served his term in concentration camps in the Mordovian Autonomous Republic and was exiled to the Komi ASSR. His first collection of poetry, Misiachne pole (The Moonlit Field, 1965), was published before his arrest. His works were subsequently proscribed in the Ukrainian SSR, but his account of life in Soviet prisons, Bil'mo (Cataract, 1971), was published in the West and was translated into English (1976), French, and German. Other collections of his poetry include Quos ego (1979) and Skyts'kyi oltar (The Scythian Altar, 1990). Osadchy returned to teaching at Lviv University in the fall of 1990, and in the spring of 1992 he became a member of the Writers' Union of Ukraine. In 1993 Yrii (Warm South Regions) the first book of his poetry to be published in Ukraine, appeared in Lviv. Mykola Kholodny's biography of Osadchy appeared in 1996 and in 2001 a collection of the poet's scholarly and journalistic works was published as Ukrainotsentryzm (Ukrainocentrism)...\n\nMykhailo Osadchy\n\nSVERSTIUK, YEVHEN, b 13 December 1928 in Siltse, Volodymyr-Volynskyi county, Volhynia, d 1 December 2014 in Kyiv. Literary and social critic, publicist, and political prisoner. He did graduate work at the Institute of Psychology in Kyiv and Odesa University and worked as a teacher in Ternopil oblast and the Poltava Pedagogical Institute. From 1959 he published articles and reviews in Soviet literary periodicals. Because of his criticism of Russification and other injustices, in 1965 he was blacklisted and dismissed from his job at the Kyiv Pedagogical Institute. Thenceforth his essays were circulated in Ukrainian samvydav and published in emigre periodicals. He was arrested in January 1972 and sentenced in March 1973, together with Ivan Svitlychny, for his involvement in the dissident movement and his defense of political prisoners, to seven years in strict-regime labor camps in Perm oblast and five years' exile in the Buriat ASSR, in Siberia. In the camps he participated in hunger strikes and other political protests. In April 1979 he was elected an honorary member of the International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists (PEN). After his release he lived in Kyiv. Editions of Sverstiuk's writings have been published in the United States in Ukrainian (1970, 1979, 1980) and in English translation (Clandestine Essays, 1976). In 1995, he was awarded the Shevchenko Prize for his essay collection Bludni syny Ukrainy (Prodigal Sons of Ukraine) published in 1993 in Kyiv. Subsequently several of his collections were published in Ukraine. Sverstiuk founded a religious newspaper Nasha vira in Kyiv in 1989 and served as its editor-in-chief...\n\nYevhen Sverstiuk\n\nKALYNETS, IHOR, b 9 July 1939 in Khodoriv, Lviv oblast. Poet. A graduate of Lviv University (1961), Kalynets was employed at the Lviv Oblast State Archive. In 1972 he and his wife, Iryna Kalynets, were victims of a wave of political arrests. Both were imprisoned; he--for 'anti-Soviet activity' (ie, because his poetry had been published in the West) to six years in labor camp and three years of exile. In May-June 1974 Kalynets took part in a hunger strike of political prisoners in a Perm region labor camp; later he signed several appeals from political prisoners to the authorities. Since his release from exile in Chita oblast in 1981, Kalynets has lived in Lviv, his poetic muse silenced. In 1987 he became one of the editors of the almanac Yevshan-zillia, one of the first uncensored Ukrainian published periodicals established during the perestroika period. Inspired by the imagistic verse of Bohdan Ihor Antonych, Kalynets developed his poetry into the finest exponent of modern Ukrainian 'engage' lyricism. He employs images that are often primeval and a vocabulary that is rich in cultural allusions while using a prosodic cadence that is contemporary. His collection Vohon' Kupala (The Fire of Kupalo) was published in Kyiv in 1966 but was immediately suppressed and all copies were confiscated. From that time until the late 1980s his poetry was blacklisted in the USSR and distributed only via samvydav publications. He was officially published only in the West. Since 1991 editions of Kalynets's poetry have also regularly appeared in Ukraine. In 1994 he published a short novel Molimos' zoriam dal'nim (Let's Pray to Distant Stars), written in 1972 during his incarceration in a Lviv prison...\n\nIhor Kalynets\n\nKALYNETS, IRYNA (nee Stasiv), b 6 December 1940 in Lviv, d 31 July 2012 in Lviv. Dissident; wife of Ihor Kalynets. A graduate of Lviv University, she taught Ukrainian language and literature at the Lviv Polytechnical Institute and published children's stories and verses. An active defender of Valentyn Moroz in 1970 and a founding member of the Committee in Defense of Nina Strokata in 1971, she was arrested in Lviv in January 1972 and sentenced in August for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda to six years in prison and three years of exile. In the labor camps of Mordovia, where she served her sentence, she joined protests against camp conditions and made demands for the recognition of political prisoners. After serving her term of exile in Chita oblast, she was released in 1981 and returned to Lviv. In the late 1980s she became an active campaigner for the restoration of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. In 1990 she was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR. Also in 1990 she became head of the Lviv Oblast Education Administration and took an active part in the reforms of the Ukrainian education system...\n\nIryna Kalynets\n\nThe preparation, editing, and display of the IEU entries about the Ukrainian dissident writers of the 1960s to 1980s were made possible by the financial support of the FOUNDATION OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF UKRAINE (Toronto, ON, Canada)."
