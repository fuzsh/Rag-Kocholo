        "text": "29.05.2022\n\nHumanitarian aspect:\n\nMayor of Mariupol Vadym Boychenko warned of a threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases in the city.According to the mayor, an epidemic in the city may be caused by the mass burials\n\nof those killed as a result of russian occupation, non-functioning sewage system, lack of garbage collection, and worsening weather conditions, including rising summer temperatures. \"Our doctors report the dangers that may appear this summer include outbreaks of infectious diseases, dysentery, cholera, etc. These diseases could kill thousands of Mariupol residents,\" the mayor reported.\n\nrussian federation troops continue to carry outfiltration measures in occupied Mariupol. Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmyla Denisova said that over the past week, russians have forcibly deported almost 3,000 Ukrainians to a filtration camp in Bezimenne, including more than 300 children. After conducting these filtration measures, the occupiers formed groups of Mariupol residents who were first deported to Taganrog and then to the poorest regions of russia. At least 10% of citizens who do not pass the filtration process are considered by the occupiers as being \"dangerous to the russian regime.\" They are then arrested and sent either to former penal colony No 52 in Olenivka, Donetsk region, or to the infamous Izolyatsia (Isolation) prison in Donetsk, which is known for its use of long interrogations, torture, threats of execution, and coercion.\n\nOperational situation:\n\nThe enemy is trying to establish full control over the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and maintain the land corridor with the temporarily occupied Crimea; they are continuing their offensive in the east of Ukraine to defeat the Ukrainian Joint Forces.\n\nIn order to prevent the transfer of Ukrainian units to other areas, the enemy continues to station troops on the section of the russian-Ukrainian border in the Bryansk and Kursk regions. The enemy rotated some units and improved fortifications in areas where they are concentrated. They continued to cover the Ukrainian-russian border in the Bryansk and Kursk regions by firing mortars at the positions of Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Sumy region. The enemy used mortars four times against Ukrainian positions near Seredyna Buda, Stari Vyrky, and Znob-Trubichevska.\n\nAn operational and tactical aircraft from the airspace of the Kursk region fired a missile at a civilian industrial facility in the Sumy region. In order to determine the position of Ukrainian troops, the enemy conducted air reconnaissance with the help of UAVs in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions.\n\nThe Belarusian Armed Forces continued to cover the Belarusian-Ukrainian border on a rotating basis. The grouping has been strengthened by units of brigades of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nResource: Centre for Defence Strategies (CDS)\n\nwww.defence.org.ua\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

However, the data is not conclusive since data collection continues in the areas of active hostilities, the temporarily occupied areas, and liberated territories.\n\nOccupying russian authorities in temporarily occupied Mariupol decided to extend the school year in the city until September 1. The occupiers will \"teach\" Mariupol children all summer to de-Ukrainianize them and prepare them for the school year, according to a russian educational program. Students will be taught russian language and literature, russian history, and mathematics in russian. In total, the invaders plan to open nine schools in the devastated city. However, they have managed to find only 53 teachers in the city so far. In addition, the occupiers are actively spreading russian propaganda to Mariupol residents who remain in the city. To do so, they have launched three mobile \"propaganda cars\" and have installed 12 large screens in public spaces, i.e., near humanitarian distribution points, places where documents are processed, and water access points. russian TV channels and videos about \"improving\" the lives of Mariupol residents under occupation are shown non-stop on these screens.\n\nrussians brought stolen surgical equipment from Mariupol to the russian-occupied Donetsk as humanitarian aid. \"Another batch of surgical equipment stolen from Mariupol hospital No1 was brought to the surgical department of the Kalinin Clinic in Donetsk. This time it was the equipment used for anesthesia. Of course, everything stolen has been wrapped in wrapping paper with 'United russia' [russia's leading political party] written on it\", the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryushchenko said.\n\nOperational situation:\n\nThe enemy is trying to establish full control over the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions and maintain a land corridor with the temporarily occupied Crimea; they are continuing their offensive in the east of Ukraine to defeat the Ukrainian Joint Forces.\n\nThe enemy focused its primary efforts on the Bakhmut direction, trying to develop [its military] success in the Lyman direction. russian troops changed tactics and moved from\n\ntrying to encircle the Ukrainian Joint Forces to smaller encirclements of individual units to deprive Ukrainian troops of logistics and reinforcements.\n\nThe morale of the invasion force personnel remains low and tends to deteriorate. The enemy continues to suffer losses. A significant number of wounded servicemen of the russian Armed Forces are being treated in medical facilities in towns bordering Ukraine. The State Duma of the russian federation and the Federation Council passed a bill to increase the maximum age for voluntary enlistment in the military from 40 to 50 years. russia's leadership has forced border commanders in russia's southern regions, including the Rostov Oblast and occupied Crimea, to cancel all summer vacations indefinitely, which could be seen as the next source of mobilization for the russian FSB border troops.\n\nResource: Centre for Defence Strategies (CDS)\n\nwww.defence.org.ua\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

Three other rockets hit two city districts, ruining civilian objects and a shopping mall. At least 62 houses were damaged in the residential area of Zaporizhzhya. The rocket strike killed one person and injured three others.\n\nThe enemy fired three missiles at Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.As a result, an industrial enterprise was destroyed.\n\nThe russians fired artillery shells at a kindergarten, church, and houses in the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nrussian troops launched an airstrike on Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast,hitting a residential sector.\n\nLuhansk Oblastis left without water, gas, and electricity.\n\nIn the occupied districts of the Donetsk Oblast,80 schools have been switched to the russian curriculum and to the russian language of teaching.\n\nThe occupiers destroy Ukrainian books and libraries.Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denysova said about 60 libraries in Ukraine had been damaged or destroyed. In addition,\n\nrussians deliberately seize and destroy Ukrainian textbooks, history books, and fiction.\n\nrussian president putin signed a decree simplifying the procedure for obtaining russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhya and Kherson Oblasts. The document was\n\nreleased yesterday, May 25, and entered into force immediately. Three years ago, on April 24, 2019, putin signed a decree introducing a simplified procedure for obtaining russian\n\ncitizenship by residents of the [occupied] Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. This time he amended it by adding two more Ukrainian Oblasts. In fact, this step means the forced issuance of\n\nrussian passports to the residents of Ukrainian territories temporarily controlled by the russian military.\n\nUkrainian National Atomic Energy Generating Company Energoatom reports that the energy crisis provoked by the russian occupiers is intensifying in the Kherson Oblast.Dozens of solar\n\nand wind power plants were destroyed; they were either looted or damaged during the shelling. The extent of the damage is currently unclear and will have to be clarified after the war.\n\nUkrainian on-line publication Texty.org.ua carries an interview with the coordinator of Nova Kakhovka (Kherson Oblast) [occupied by russian forces] volunteer movement regarding the humanitarian situation in the region.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in the Kherson Oblast is created artificially. Probably trying to force people to welcome russian humanitarian aid, russian troops did not allow any businesses or volunteer initiatives to bring any food or medicine into the region once they had occupied it.\n\nThe situation is the worst in the right bank rural areas which have no access to food storage facilities. Occupiers bring some food into the cities from Crimea, but this is not enough to meet the need. People also have no money to buy food.\n\nBringing medicines in is a bit easier than food since those are mostly very specific and are not needed by soldiers at checkpoints.\n\nThe hospital in Nova Kakhovka lacks medicines and basic things like syringes and gauze. Only three drug stores are open in the city carrying prohibitively russian expensive drugs. There are many elderly people in the occupied territories, and more of them die from the lack of medication than from shelling. The situation with medicines in rural areas is catastrophic.\n\nOperational situation:\n\nThe enemy is trying to establish full control over the entire Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and maintain the land corridor with the temporarily occupied Crimea; it continues the offensive\n\nin eastern Ukraine to defeat the Ukrainian Joint Forces.\n\nThe enemy intensified the use of aircraft to support its ground groupings offensive. Due to the shortage of high-precision missiles, the enemy is looking for other ways to destroy critical\n\nand military facilities in Ukraine.\n\nThe aggressor continues protecting the Ukrainian-russian border and fortification of its bases in the Bryansk Oblast of the russian federation. russian forces launched airstrikes on civil\n\nand military infrastructure in the Sumy Oblast of Ukraine from the territory of the russian federation.\n\nUp to seven battalions of the Armed Forces of the Republic of belarus continue to strengthen control over the belarusian-Ukrainian border. The threat of the enemy's missile and air strikes\n\nfrom the territory of belarus remains.\n\nIn the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea, the enemy is forming reserve units to conduct hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nThe occupiers continue to violate the rights of Ukrainian citizens in the temporarily occupied territories, impede free movement and artificially intensify the humanitarian crisis.\n\nResource: Centre for Defence Strategies (CDS)\n\nwww.defence.org.ua\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

The enemy directed all its forces to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. But in three months, they barely made progress. That's why\n\nthey continue to fire on cities. Especially crowded places,\" Haidai said.\n\nAt night, russian troops fired rockets at the Kharkiv region, damaging civilian infrastructure and about 30 private homes.\n\nrussian troops blocked the entrance to Balaklia, Kharkiv region, for humanitarian aid, the local administration reported.\n\nThe occupiers are using weapons to prevent civilians from leaving the Luhansk region for the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Government. During the evacuation of the residents from Hirske, the bus came under fire from the russian military. Fortunately, 18 civilians on the bus are safe. The region is in a critical situation with the evacuation of civilians from the zone of active hostilities and the delivery of humanitarian goods. Despite the fact that Ukraine uses all opportunities to save people, there are fewer and fewer safe routes due to constant shelling by the occupiers.\n\nThe russian occupiers continue to kidnap civiliansin the temporarily occupied territories for their pro-Ukrainian position.\n\nMariupol is on the verge of epidemic and environmental disasters.

The most severe hostilities are observed in the Donetsk operational area near Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk.\n\nThe enemy launched an airstrike on the Ukrainian Armed Forces near Bilopillya, Sumy region. The enemy is increasing the cover of the Ukrainian-russian border in the Bryansk and Kursk\n\nregions (russia). The enemy is constructing fortifications at the Pogar international checkpoint and around Sluchovsk and Bryansk.\n\nThe enemy continued to use terror tactics against Ukrainian civilians in the occupied territories. The socio-economic situation in southern and eastern Ukraine is deteriorating.\n\nThe morale of the invasion force personnel remains low and tends to deteriorate. There is systematic alcohol abuse and desertion. The personnel of the enemy's units complains about the ineffectiveness of their attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.\n\nResource: Centre for Defence Strategies (CDS)\n\nwww.defence.org.ua\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

The graves are mostly not very deep. After reopening damaged water supply systems, water spilled on the ground and began to erode graves. As a result, there is a high risk of cadaveric poison, bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and other pathogens that may have been in the deceased getting in the water supply system, underground springs, and rivers. As the occupiers also damaged sewage filtration and pumping stations, drinking water mixes with sewage and becomes unfit for consumption. In addition, trash has not been removed for over two months, and it has piled up near houses. Some of the garbage has been flooded with water from damaged water supply pipes and rain, leading to the growth of pathogenic bacteria that can enter groundwater, rivers, and the sea. Exploded rockets and air bombs have also contaminated soil and groundwater in the city with chemicals and heavy metals, which leads to the accumulation of carcinogenic waste that is dangerous for humans and the environment.
