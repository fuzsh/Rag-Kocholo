Nakonechnyi's Stolen Name is a book of great power of persuasion, all statements supported by references to authentic materials and scientific research. Being a profound study, it is nonetheless read as an adventure story, full of exciting events and discoveries. Written in 2001, it seems to contain answers to a great number of questions of today, not only for Ukraine and Russia but also for the whole world.\n\nThe purpose of Shadows is to be a platform of communication for translators and interpreters of all countries.

Here they can share their experience,\n\ntalk to authors, dispute and discover something new\n\nin their profession.\n\nThe journal articles are also interesting for the\n\nreaders who are not involved in any translation\n\nwork.\n\nThe first issue covers the translation of classical\n\nliterature and literary translation as an important\n\nfactor for shaping the image of Ukraine in the world.\n\nHere you can follow the “dialogue” between an\n\nauthor and a translator regarding the complexity of\n\ntranslating a novel. The role of interpreters working\n\nwith journalists in armed conflict zones, the issues\n\nof healthcare interpreting in the US, the role of\n\ninterpreters in crimes investigation at London\n\nMetropolitan Police, as well as some curious facts\n\nabout interpreting state leaders of Ukraine are\n\ndescribed in the professional translation section of\n\nthe journal.\n\nWe are also discussing the lifestyle of translators,\n\nwhich is shaped by the profession. The authors and\n\nguests of this issue are translators, interpreters (and\n\nnot only them!) from Ukraine, the United States, the\n\nUnited Kingdom and South African Republic.\n\nThe paper provides a comparative analysis of the literary proper names Pontius Pilate in the novel Mister and Margaret by M.

Bulgakov and Noah in A History of the World in 10.5 Chapters by J. Barnces. The two poetonyms are compared in terms of their semantic development in the novel, their functions as a means of a personage characteristic are analysed.\n\nThe paper deals with the translation of similes with poetonymic components from English into Russian by analyzing those found in the novel A Histoiy o f the World in 10 /2 Chapters by J.

Barnce. The translation of similes of the kind is complicated due to the use of proper names (poetonyms) with encyclopedic content characterizing one of the personages. Poetonyms of Biblical and mythological origin perform the function of means o f comparison in the text. The translation o f such similes have been considered in different aspects: rendering the simile structure, its components, forms and markers, and poetonyms.\n\nThe paper deals with the study of poetonyms o f mythological / biblical origin as components o f tropes and figures of speech.

It covers such aspects as status o f the proper names in language, their referents, as well as the affect o f the context on actualization of co-meanings of such lexical units. The proper names with encyclopedic content differ from other groups o f proper names because their status in the language can change when they are used figuratively and acquire new connotations. Such proper names have features o f common names since they refer not to individual objects but to some notions, which is characteristic o f common names. The paper studies the status of lexical units derived from proper names o f mythological and Biblical origin, the process o f transforming proper names into common ones. Such names used in the function o f tropes illustrate the process o f transforming proper names into common ones. The semantics of mythonyms and Biblical onyms contains many components which can be realized only when influenced by the context. It is usually the wide context o f the whole literary work that is needed for the name to actualize the components o f meaning and perform its stylistic function. The case o f English, American and Ukrainian literary texts with the use of mythonyms and Biblical names in the function o f tropes has been observed to reveal the problem o f status and semantics of proper names under consideration.\n\nThe paper belongs to the domain of legal translation from English into Ukrainian.

It deals with the specific features of the EU – Ukraine Association Agreement as the text illustrating English of the European Union. The difference between British English and EU English is accounted for by the differences in legal systems and long-term influence of different European languages on the English language as lingua franca of the Union. The paper studies specific lexical and grammatical traits of the text in terms of their being a challenge of translation. Here belong lexical units to denote European notions, nonequivalent lexical units, some grammatical features,\n\nnot found in Ukrainian, which require the application of compensatory\n\ntechniques. Some errors and inconsistencies of translation were detected and analysed. The conclusion was made concerning the importance of translation in legal context, and the necessity to apply an in-depth study approach while translating texts of state importance.\n\nThe aim of the paper is to introduce the notion of translatability potential, which can be viewed from the philosophical perspective, as it aligns with the problem of untranslatability raised by several philosophers who referred to... more\n\nThe aim of the paper is to introduce the notion of translatability potential, which can be viewed from the philosophical perspective, as it aligns with the problem of untranslatability raised by several philosophers who referred to translation in general in their works. For instance, Hadamer, Heidegger, Derrida used to speak and meditate the mentioned issue in their works, they were concerned with the potential possibility to express ideas in another language, transfer them to other cultures, and placing them in a new language environment. The paper considers this problem from the point of a legal discourse translation field, as it is a complicated system including multiple aspects presenting challenges for translators, which in the process of translation determines the correlation between the object and the subject. Translatability potential is suggested as a starting point to identify if a text or a linguistic unit is possible to render using another language. The paper also studies how much the interpretation of the source of a legal text affects the fulfillment of its translatability potential.\n\nThe paper belongs to the domain of legal translation from English into Ukrainian.

It explores the challenges and considerations involved in translating legal terms, particularly within the context of EU legislative acts. The concept of translatability potential is substantiated in the article. It is seen as language pair-dependent, influenced by the availability of similar legal concepts in the target law system, equivalent terms in the target language, and other factors. The research delves into the levels of translatability potential of legal terms, taking into consideration the existence of identical concepts in the target legal system, the mono- or polysemic semantic structure of the source term, and the established translation practices accepted by legal professionals. Based on these criteria, legal terms are classified into categories of high, upper-medium, lower-medium, and low translatability potentials. The article applies these c..."
