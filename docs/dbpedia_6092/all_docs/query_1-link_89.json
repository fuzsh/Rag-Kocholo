        "text": "She is an organizer of improvisation evenings in Kyiv, founder of the \"Freshfish\" dance theater (the basis of the theater was movement laboratories and performances based on improvisation). She is fond of organic movement, the art of speaking with the body, harmonious group work in structures and duets, work on the border between theater and dance.\n\nVioleta`s debut solo work - \"How much do I need\" was created at the \"Artil\" festival (Ukraine). The second and the most significant is \"One more step\" created during the residency at Derida Stage, Bulgaria after the beginning of Russia`s full-scale invasion to Ukraine.\n\nNudity, which fits as much as possible to emphasize the movement, leaves visible every micro movement of the body, emphasizes its plasticity and nature, at the same time acquires a certain decorativeness, colorfulness and a new expressiveness that can only arise from the processing of nature by human hands.\n\nA girl with a scythe certainly evokes powerful and recognizable associations. However, her nudity will make this image wider and more universal. You will see both Death and the one who faces it. You will see outrageous brutality and insecurity. Thirty minutes of scythe dance. Thirty minutes of the dance of death. Dance of life.\n\nDuration: 30 min.\n\nBohdan Polishchuk is a theater director and scenographer.\n\nBohdan is a graduate of the National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture, Kyiv.\n\nCo-founder of the public organization Gallery of Scenography and the International Festival Lviv Quadrennial of Scenography.\n\nCurator of art projects, art exhibitions, author of publications and compiler of books on the art of theatrical costume and scenography.\n\nFor more than ten years, he has been working with various municipal and national theaters of Ukraine and independent artistic initiatives as a scenographer and director.\n\nBohdan Polishchuk works in the direction of intellectual and visual theater, which combines modern drama, music, dramatic acting and dance.\n\nLesya Kekuatova is a choreographer, dancer and teacher.\n\nFor several years, she taught at the Department of Contemporary Dance of the Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University. She is the founder of the choreographic studio DUNAY.\n\nLesya is a graduate of Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University.\n\nFor more than ten years she has been working as a choreographer and dancer in various art projects, combining dance with her background as a theater actor.\n\nLesya is a choreographer and dancer of the Dance Macabre performance. She creates and performs the central image of this action - a Girl with a scythe.\n\nVarvara Turta is a professional musician, harpsichordist, pianist and performer.\n\nVarvara is a graduate of the R. Glier Kyiv Municipal Academy of Music and the National Academy of Music of Ukraine named after P. I. Tchaikovsky.\n\nConstantly improves his level at master classes of famous European harpsichordists.\n\nShe practices intense concert activity, is a participant and winner of international harpsichord competitions in Ukraine and Europe.\n\nVarvara is also open to experiments, studies Argentine tango and has experience as a performer in theater projects.\n\nVarvara started playing the hurdy-gurdy, and researched the Ukrainian tradition of playing this instrument, especially for the performance Dance Macabre. Ðmmortal dance.\n\nVarvara is not only a performer in this performance, but she is also a co-author, because the music, the main solution of the performance, is created by the method of fixed improvisation\n\nFive female Ukrainian dancers, torn from their homes, are here and now. Each for herself and yet together. They are kept above water by their creativity, the ability to create and the opportunity to find a new community â an artistic family.\n\nAt the same time, Together Alone brings closer the work of other Ukrainian artists. The production is inspired by Anton Ovchinnikovâs verses written during the war in Kyiv and is accompanied by the music of the Canadian-based Ukrainian radical anti-Putin band Balaklava Blues. TomÃ¡Å¡ Kerle took care of fine-tuning the sound atmosphere.\n\nDuration: 25 min.\n\nShe participated in the ballet of Aya Perfilieva, Beit Grand Theater, Odesa as well as in projects under guidance by choreographers like Jerome Meyer, Isabelle Chaffaud, Eldad Ben Sasson or Olga Labovkina. After that she started the âSpeaking with the Body'' festival, which took place only once.\n\nIn March 2022, she took her daughter and several students and fled from the war to Prague, where she now works. She is involved in projects by other choreographers (Anna KÃ¤llblad, Nicole Beutler, POCKETART) and herself leads workshops for children and develops her own creative work with various artists.\n\nâTogether Aloneâ is the first part of the triptych of the same name, which she wants to complete with dancers from the Czech Republic and Burkina Faso during 2023. Last year she started a series of interactive performances âOn the wayâ as part of the âDance to Hostelsâ project for Ukrainian refugees, which she followed up with the premiere of a new interactive work for children called âChildhood Timeâ.\n\nToday, when the Russian army destroys cities and the population of Ukraine, inhumanity and destruction become new symbols of Russia. How can this metamorphosis change the view of Russian classical ballet? Can it still be a cover for the lawlessness, anti-humanism and imperial habits of the Russian elite? How the war could change the perception of ballet as an art form that is deeply rooted in European culture but which has become a mainstay and glossy cover of Russian art for export?\n\nThe performance offers a new utopian vision of what a traditional classical ballet class might look like in a country where the entire cultural industry works to support the military-industrial complex and is subject to state ideology and propaganda.\n\nThe performance is based on the poem âNew Russian Balletâ by Anton Ovchinnikov, which was written at the beginning of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, namely on March 31, 2022\n\nDuration: 35 min\n\nSince 2008 he is the artistic director of the Black O!Range dance productions company. The company was recognized as one of the most distinctive and original dance projects in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2015 Ovchinnikov co-founded the All-Ukrainian Association âContemporary Dance Platformâ. Since then he is the President of the institution. Main objectives of the Association are to support young Ukrainian choreographers, integrate contemporary dance into the modern cultural life of Ukraine and establish the national center of contemporary dance.\n\nIn 2016-2021 Anton Ovchinnikov presented a few solo performances and created four multidisciplinary projects. In 2017 he was the fellow of CEC Artslink Residency in the USA.\n\nSince 2018 Anton Ovchinnikov is the member of the expert panel of Ukrainian Cultural Foundation.\n\nDirector and performer, Rita Lira, who was forced to move from Ukraine, created a performance based on interviews from real people who are from or have been to the deoccupied territories after the invasion of russian soldiers. The majority of the sounds for this performance are documentary recordings.\n\nRita recorded on her phone almost everything that happened around her during her stay in Ukraine in the first days of the invasion. All music for this performance was created without the use of professional equipment or studios. Composer Maryana Savchenko recorded vocals for a choir in a hotel bathroom in China. Singer Pavlo Moskalenko recorded his vocals on a telephone recorder in Ukraine.\n\nThe movement of the performance is always in a free form, which makes each showing of this performance unique. Rita decided not to work with exact choreography because this performance is not about beautiful dance. âThis is a real story of real people, and for me only improvisation at the moment of each part can create and convey true emotionsâ. The performer conveys the feeling from the first emotions of absurdity, confusion and horror through pain and loss to the present strength, pride and insurmountable struggle for life, peace and freedom!\n\nDuration: 55 min.\n\nâEvery Minute Motherlandâ is a documentary work with internal and external views on the events of the last months. The experience engraved in dancersâ bodies will be released on stage transcribed in motion and time and reaching for the spirit of ritual and myth.\n\nMaciej KuÅºmiÅski, who also helps refugees as a volunteer, calls the war in Ukraine one of the most influential events of his life. In âEvery Minute Motherlandâ he considers the war as a massive force that over and over brings the world in physical and existential motion, questioning our values, identities and ideas of safety and home.\n\nThe performance features 7 high-class dancers who are also its co-authors. Only with the language of movement they honestly express a living experience of being torn and unsettled, suspended between the memory of the past and the unbelievable present, hoping to find a path of mutual understanding with the world.\n\nDuration: 60 min."
