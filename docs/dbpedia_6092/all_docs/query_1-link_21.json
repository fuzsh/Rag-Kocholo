        "text": "#Navalny Source https://lnkd.in/dsD2YPMK The death of Alexey Navalny in the ‚ÄúPolar Wolf‚Äù penal colony above the Arctic Circle removes any remaining doubt w0about the fact that the Russian Presidential Elections scheduled the 17 March 2024 will be a tragic farce. Although the regime had already implemented repressive measures, ten years ago Navalny managed to run (coming second with 27.4% of voters in the elections 9/ 8 /2013 for the Mayor of Moscow. Political liberties were limited but since then the process of authoritarian involution has undergone a acceleration of which Italian public opinion has not been informed by the media. To sweeten the pill newspapers continue to talk about autocracy; the truth is that in the last decade the Russian Federation has fallen into a ferocious dictatorship based on internal repression and international aggression that recalls the invasions of Soviet tanks in Budapest 1956 Prague 1968 Kabul 1979. To describe the political involution, it is enough to remember that a few months ago, on 8/18/23 - with the sacred blessing of a prelate - a statue of Stalin was inaugurated with great media fanfare in the city of Velikji Luke, arousing controversy even in the the Orthodox Church whose orientation is notoriously pro-Putin. Someone must have remembered that in 30 years Stalin's regime tens of thousands of Christian priests were killed and an greater number of churches destroyed. What to do? Navalny death tragically marks a watershed and Italian politics must react with a strong messagge. I am very clear about the differences in the historical contexts but when I heard of Navalny's death I thought of Giacomo Matteotti and the history of the following twenty years We need striking gestures of protest that highlight to the eyes of the world the liberticidal brutality of the Kremlin which, moreover, does not even allow the mothers of Russian soldiers combating an dying in Ukraine to demonstrate in the streets. The first thing (taking inspiration from what we did for Elena Bronner, wife of Andrei Sakharov is to invite his mother Lumilla and his wife Lulia to Italy and discuss the best choices to honor Alexey Navalny and contnue his battles for freedom But a political decision is also needed to make the Kremlin understand that Italy is not to be trifled with when it comes to freedom. On this front, the revocation of Alexey Miller's honor as Grand Officer of the Italian Republic is certainly a significant choice to be CONSIDE (also due to his dense network of relationships in Italy) https://lnkd.in/dae8uEVj Frankly, I don't think that the President and CEO of Gazprom still deserves the prestigious Italian honor that he received in 2010 from Ambassador Vittorio Claudio Surdo, at the time head of the Italian Embassy in Moscow and subsequently International Advisor of ENEL\n\n'Sehenden Auges - Mut zum strategischen Kurswechsel' is now out and online in Ukrainianüá∫üá¶ From the Preface ‚ÄúCourage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality that guarantees all other‚Äù (Winston Churchill) Dear Ukrainians, Mostly likely, we have never met personally; and yet you are constantly on my mind. For more than two years now, Russia is terrorizing your country with unprecedented brutal force. This is outrageous. It breaks my heart and infuriates my mind. For me, Moscow‚Äôs terror against your country touches upon a very fundamental issue. At its very heart lies the question in which world we want to live. Do we want to live in a jungle, ruled by the law of the strongest? In a lawless space where brute military force is considered an acceptable means of asserting national interests? Do we want to live in a Europe in which a kleptocratic group of people denies the existence of a sovereign democratic state? Or do we want to live in a Europe that is governed by the rule of law? In which the principle of non-violence exists not only on paper, but also in reality? Do we want to continue to live in self-determined, democratic order where human rights and free choices are guaranteed for every one of us? I don‚Äôt hide my deep disappointment about the West‚Äôs response to the war. I would like to see a much more determined, agile, and steadfast response by Western governments in providing Ukrainians with the military means it requires to defend their country. I would like to see NATO and EU members constraining and containing the Putin regime with all they have. But due to the West‚Äôs reluctance to confront the Moscow terror regime with resolve, many Ukrainian lives have been lost. Above all, Russia‚Äôs unprecedented war of aggression against your country, Ukraine, requires an iron political will, perseverance, and resilience. And these qualities, in turn, presuppose a large dose of realism and courage. You, Ukrainians, are demonstrating an unbelievable sense of courage and strength in the face of missile attacks, destruction, and death. I feel nothing but admiration for your bravery and determination to defend your country‚Äôs freedom! We, your European neighbours, must muster the same courage. Each of us should stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and support you in your struggle for self-defence. I dedicated this book to you, dear Ukrainian friends. I will not stop advocating your righteous course in public and raising my voice loudly in your support until the aggressor is defeated. I am extremely thankful to my friends from the American University Kyiv for making this book accessible to you. May God bless you, your families, and friends. Slava Ukraine. Yours Stefanie üíûüá∫üá¶ American University Kyiv Mark Voyger Holger Dr. Bahle\n\nüåüDavide Borgoni‚Äôs proposal for the end of the European conflict with Russia ‚è∫Ô∏èPremise The recent peace #Summit held in #Switzerland on 15/16 June 2024, at the B√ºrgestock Resort, raised concerns due to unilateral decisions taken without the presence of Russian representatives. Switzerland, which has no longer been considered neutral since the conflict began more than 2 years ago, has shown clear favoritism towards #Ukraine. It‚Äôs worth noting that Swiss banks have been associated with the wealth of Jewish families around the world. In 2019, Western powers installed Jewish Volodymyr Zelensky as president of Ukraine, potentially to divert attention from the country's ongoing glorification of Nazism. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his disgust with Zelenskiy's desire to hide the glorification of Nazism and the participation of Ukrainian nationalists in the Holocaust. The summit aimed to achieve a just peace and brought together 101 delegations: 93 countries and 8 international organizations. Notably, China was absent, while Western countries focused on India and Saudi Arabia. The main challenge is convincing Russia and Putin to compromise. Putin called for the annexation of the occupied regions to #Russia and ensured that Ukraine would not join NATO, while Ukraine upheld the principles of the United Nations Charter. During the summit, Ukrainian President and the Western bloc tried to obtain a firm commitment from Indian representative. Rumors were circulating about an upcoming peace conference in #SaudiArabia, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed the importance of Russia's involvement in future discussions. Representatives of Italia, USA and France also actively participated in the summit. ‚èπÔ∏è Davide Borgoni proposes the next conference be held in #Reykjavik, #Iceland, a neutral European nation that offers more guarantees than Switzerland. Reykjav√≠k has minimal #Jewish presence and influence, with only 300 individuals. Furthermore, the conference is expected to exclude representatives from USA and UK, given their historic anti-Russia and pro-Israel foreign policies. Instead, only observers from #UN, #EU and #BRICS should be present to ensure balanced and inclusive representation. The primary objective of the conference is to find a just and lasting solution to the conflict, respecting the rights and aspirations of all parties involved. By holding the conference in Reykjav√≠k with neutral observers, an environment of open dialogue and mutual understanding can be fostered. The involvement of international organizations such as the UN, EU, together with emerging as the BRICS, will provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a peaceful solution that brings stability and prosperity to the region.
