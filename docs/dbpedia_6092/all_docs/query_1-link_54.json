        "text": "Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.” – Aristotle\n\nDr. Papadopoulos is making a mark in the field of language education with impressive research projects and publications related to language teaching in the 21st century. I have been following the online presentations of Dr. Isaak Papadopoulos, a 32-year-old professor, for the past 3 years. He stresses what a traditional person wants to hear: Greek language, culture, and Greek Orthodoxy without the insertion of political philosophy. Culture and civilization are what we want our children and grandchildren to learn.\n\nI had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Papadopoulos online. The interview follows:\n\nDr Isaak Papadopoulos, could you please tell us a few things about you and your family?\n\nProf. Tsounis, first of all, I would like to thank you so much for this very kind invitation to discuss language teaching. It is an honor for me. I was born and raised in Larissa and more specifically, in a small village called “Omorfochori” which was created by refugees coming from Constantinople, Smyrna, and Cappadocia. I have a beautiful and sweetheart wife, Varvara and two amazing kids, Despoina-Chrysovalanto and Michael. We live in Larissa and we are working in a private primary school “Center of Hellenic Paideia”.\n\nThat is very interesting, as we have noticed that apart from your teaching and general academic obligations, you have a significant role in your family. It is quite difficult for someone to keep a balance.\n\nYes, you are absolutely right! It has been quite difficult to keep a balance between the academic and family obligations. However, I feel supported by my wife, who supports me in everything. Mind you, our first child was born when I was in the second year of my PhD studies and our second one came to life when I completed my PhD. I remember myself waking up 6 to 7 times a night, so eventually I told my self “Isaak, wake up and start writing your thesis”.\n\nGreat. Would you like to discuss your studies and your educational background so that we can reach our goal to focus on your personal approaches and methods with regard to language teaching?\n\nYes, of course! I have studied at the University of Western Macedonia in Florina majoring in Primary Education while just after my graduation, I decided to have Postgraduate studies at Degli Studi Roma Tre Universita in Rome focusing on Language Teaching to students with learning difficulties. When I completed my studies, I returned back to Greece, and I pursued my PhD at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in the field of “Rhetoric and Written Discourse of Primary Education Students.” It was a very interesting journey for me as I changed three different universities, two different countries and many professors all whom I appreciate.\n\nHow did you decide to start an academic career? When did all start for you?\n\nActually, I started thinking about an academic career while being an undergraduate student in Florina. I was impressed by research, conferences, educational projects. I thought also that it would be very useful to combine both the school experience with the academic/research context. Thus, I continued with my master and my PhD. While having my MA, I was invited to teach courses related to Pedagogy, Children Literature and Teaching Practice at an educational institute and I really enjoyed that. I was looking for such positions, because I was really fond of designing research projects with my students, implementing projects at experimental schools. So, when I completed my PhD, I applied for an academic position in Cyprus, at the European University Cyprus and I started my academic teaching and research experience as a scientific collaborator of linguistics.\n\nI remember that when you offer lectures for Greek language teachers in New York, you taught at the European University Cyprus and now you are at Larnaca College. What happened?\n\nSometimes, I continue the tradition of my ancestors of Minor Asia. I am very often ripped out of environments where I have contributed and suddenly something else emerges for me in a new environment. With the advent of COVID19, the programme of the European University Cyprus turned into online mode, so permanent academic professors taught most of the courses, so as a part-time and newly appointed instructor I had to quit. However, just after that another university in Cyprus called “UNICAF University” called me for an interview and I began to teach their courses related to Language Teaching Methodology, First and Second Language Acquisition, Linguistics etc. It is an international organization and I learnt a lot from them. In the second year of my collaboration, the Director of Larnaca College invited me to serve as the Head of School of Education and upon my evaluation, I was titled as “Assistant Professor of Applied Linguistics and Teaching Greek as L1 and L2”. All of these positions were online because of COVID19 and I felt really lucky to have had that experience.\n\nHow much difficult do you find having to collaborate with a new institute?\n\nUnfortunately, it is very difficult. But it can be very simple when the new institute respects you and your experience and allows you to offer. It is difficult because you have to learn new people, to learn to communicate and collaborate with them and then to start offering your services. Especially, online collaborations can be tiring and stressful, but especially in UNICAF and Larnaca College, I was able to do whatever I wished to because they allowed me to contribute. The good thing is that I have collaborated with so many people from different countries that it is now something ordinary for me.\n\nSince you mentioned that, I can see you have many international collaborations. How is that possible, especially considering your young age?\n\nFrankly speaking, I have an inner desire for collaboration with people. It is true that I have collaborated with the universities in Cyprus, the University of Tirana in Albania in the MA programme of “Teaching Greek as L2”, Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University by teaching courses related to Teaching Young Learners, the University of Kragujevac by designing and implementing a transnational study with Dr Vera Savic. All of these collaborations started with a personal email coming from my and being sent to them asking for a collaboration. I am a young academic and I wanted to be connected with people who are experts in their field. For example, Dr Vera Savic is an expert in Teaching Young Language Learners, I sent her an email asking for help on a project, she answered in a very polite way, we continued our communication and then we designed our joint project. The same happens also with Dr Evgenia Theodotou from the University of East London. She has developed a very interesting programme about Play and Learn through the Arts, which I liked so much that I communicated with her.\n\nWe see also that you are dealing with Second Language Teaching very often. Why? How important is for your promoting multilingualism?\n\nI was born in a multilingual village in Larissa. Many immigrants from Albania and Romania used to come to my village to work in the fields. My neighbors were Albanian, my classroom when I was a student was multilingual, I had classmates from Balkan countries and then this continued in the junior and senior high school. You can see that multilingualism and multiculturalism go hand in hand with my personal bring up and my development. I have lived such situation as a student, and I decided to delve into that field as a researcher too. I have lived, cooperated, played, and fought with bilingual students with migration biography, it is not something I just know as a situation or a population that my university students teach and supervise their work. Therefore, sometimes I feel that theories and educational projects, which are advertised and promoted through social media are hard to be implemented in such classrooms. I remember myself helping my classmates in the park, by teaching Greek words, reading Greek tales…I also remember myself offering secret gifts to my classmates as their parents did not have enough money for a birthday party.\n\nDo you think that Teaching Greek as a Second Language has changed?\n\nOf course! It is not the same context, the same population and demands. Moreover, very good professors from Greece such as Petroulla Tsokalidou, Apsasia Chatzidaki, Maria Dimasi, Spyridoula Bella have offered so much! They have carried out research projects, they have authored books (academic and schoolbooks), they have supported contexts of Teaching Greek as L2 to a great extent and I feel really happy that I have collaborated with two of them. I admire them and I would be so privileged if I were able to learn by them by collaboration in person. However, they lived in different cities and islands, so it is difficult.\n\nFrom my part, I have seen that language teaching should be more communicative. I feel that sometimes, students are bombarded with a lot of information, but they are not allowed to “talk.” In one of my papers, I have written that they have difficulty in “Forming a question but they are often available to answer a comprehension question.” I think that language classrooms and teachers should focus on fostering creative and critical thinking in a communicative environment.\n\nBut you have already written two books, Isaak. That is a great achievement. How and why did you decide to do so?\n\nI am very proud of myself for this writing activity. My first book – monography- is titled “From translanguaging pedagogy to classroom pedagogy” was written with much of pleasure during the pandemic. I felt that I would like to offer something I have implemented and researched to other students and colleagues. It is a book, which discussed the role of translanguaging on strengthening communication, interaction, and literacy skills of students in classrooms with linguistic and cultural diversity. I have also included much of photo material and lesson plans, which had been implemented in Greece. My second book was the result of a collaboration with Dr Sofia Rapti and it is about the teaching of Reading and Writing skills in primary education underlining the important challenges of the current multidimensional classrooms and the teachers need to stress their focus on the students’ needs.\n\nDo you have any personal “preference” as regards to the language teaching approaches and methods?\n\nWell, personally speaking, language teaching is and should be considered carefully because language classrooms are not only places where the teachers will teach grammar and vocabulary, which are of course very important. Having taught since 2010 in primary schools, in private lessons, in secondary institutes and of course in the university, being affected by my multilingual and multicultural experiences and language teaching, I feel that every language lesson should provide students with multiple opportunities to develop dialogical competencies, which are of utmost importance especially in the 21st century. Students need to be express themselves, to justify their preferences and views, to interact with other, to affect and be affected by others. Moreover, I think that modern classrooms should cultivate the inner beauty of the children. Children are not boxes or robots which are trained to act in a specific way. They are alive organisms, and they develop or they need to develop. In an era with so many crises, attempting to help students to develop their inner beauty and express it verbally and non-verbally is crucial. Last, teachers should be careful with the teaching and learning environment. Fostering a game-based environment has long been acknowledged as an effective framework for education. It is not innovation, and I am surprised that many new academics/researchers promote games as an innovation, it is naturality! It is not innovative that children play and learn!\n\nAll of them are really important. Do you have any dream or any plan for the future?\n\nOf course! My main concern is to foster a good environment for my children along with my wife. This is very important as our current era has various challenges which need to be seriously considered by us. As for my academic plans, I would like to find an academic position in Greece. I know that some people may say that I am very young but I do not think that it is a matter of age. I would like to belong to a department, to offer my services without the fear and the anxiety of finding a new working environment. Last, as for my dreams, my main dream is to see the language teaching classrooms to follow a more refreshing and communicative model. It is up to all of us to prepare the university students and the develop the active teachers to do so!"
