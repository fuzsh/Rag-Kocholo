Berlin Oranienburger Straße is a railway station in the city of Berlin, Germany, located on Oranienburger Straße. It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and local tram lines.

On 27 July 1936 the station was opened as part of the new North-South Tunnel. On 25 April 1945 the S-Bahn ceased operation due to the Soviet invasion, which had reached Berlin on 21 April. Most likely on 2 May 1945 the SS exploded the tunnel ceiling under Landwehrkanal, which caused the subsequent flooding of the tunnel, including Oranienburger Straße station. After drainage and repair the station reopened for traffic on 16 November 1947. During the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany and East Berlin the S-Bahn, operated by the eastern Deutsche Reichsbahn, interrupted traffic between 17 June until 9 July 1953.
