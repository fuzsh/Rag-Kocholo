        "text": "Book in advance and save: Yes\n\nOnline bookings open: up to 6 months ahead of the travel date\n\nThis booking period tends to be shorter when looking up journeys between mid August and mid October.\n\nThe alternative route via Frankfurt tends to be the cheaper, because the German national rail operator, DB, offers its discounted âEuropa-Spezialâ tickets on that route, but theyâre not available when travelling via Koln/Cologne.\n\nThough the prices of both routes can be compared on the Trainline website.\n\nOn this routing it's worth checking whether you can save money by booking separate tickets for the Paris to Koln/Cologne and Koln/Cologne to Berlin journeys.\n\nThough be aware that if you do so - and the Thalys train from Paris arrives too late in Koln for you to make the fastest connection (of between 30 and 35 mins) into the train on to Berlin; you may have to book a new ticket in Koln for the journey on to Berlin.\n\nHowever, an option is to book the separate tickets, but then take a later train on from Koln, to allow more than 1hr 30mins to make the connection at Koln Hbf station.\n\nIf you DOÂ want to book the end-2-end journey on SNCF Connect look for the journeys that have 2 corresp. THALYS ICE' in the journey summary.\n\nAnd if you book an end-2-end ticket from Paris to Berlin, in the event of the train arriving too late in Koln to make the connection on to Berlin, your tickets/reservations can be transferred to the next departure.\n\nRail Pass Users:\n\nIf you will be travelling with a Eurail or InterRail pass valid in both France and Germany, you will save money if you travel on the alternative route via [Frankfurt (Main) because the rail pass reservation fees are more expensive on the Paris â Koln Thalys trains.\n\nBook early and save: Yes\n\nOnline bookings usually open: up to 6 months ahead of the travel date - but this period of time is shorter when looking up journeys in August to October.\n\nA choice of tickets\n\nFour types of ticket are typically available:\n\nTwo types of discounted tickets, which will be cheaper the further ahead you book - Sparpreis Europa and Super Sparpreis Europa\n\nTwo types of non-discounted ticket - Flexpreis Europa and Flexpreis Plus Europa.\n\nA key difference between these types of tickets is refunds:\n\nSuper Sparpreis tickets are cheapest, but they can't be refunded at all.\n\nSparpreis tickets can be refunded for a fee, but the refund will be in the form of travel vouchers to be used for alternative / future journeys.\n\nFlexpreis Europa and Flexpreis Plus Europa tickets can be refunded at no additional charge.\n\nThe other key difference is that both types of Sparpreis tickets are only valid on the specific departures selected when booking, but both types of Flexpreis tickets live up to their name, as they can be used on any departure on your travel date.\n\nNote that none of the tickets can be exchanged to a different departure.\n\nThere's no need for this to be available for Flexpreis Europa tickets, as they aren't train departure specific.\n\nIf you book a Sparpreis Europa ticket and want to travel by a different departure you can refund it and then use the travel voucher towards the cost of the new booking.\n\nSuper Sparpreis Europa tickets can't be exchanged or refunded.\n\nThe Sparpreis, Flexpreis and Flexpreis Plus tickets also include 'City tickets', which can be used on public transport from Berlin Hbf to locations in Berlin city centre.\n\nSeat reservations\n\nReservations are mandatory on the train from Paris, so will be included, when booking tickets, but if you will be using a rail pass you will need to make a reservation.\n\nSeat reservations are optional on the ICE train on Berlin.\n\nThey cost â¬4.90 when travelling in 2nd Class and â¬5.90 when travelling in 1st class -\n\nSpecific seats can be selected from seating plans - you don't have to accept the seat(s) that you will be automatically offered.\n\nThey are included within the cost of booking 1st class Flexpreis tickets and both 1st and 2nd class Flexpreis Plus tickets.\n\nOn this journey which involves two trains on which seat reservations are available, the fees cover all trains - if reservations are added when initially booking.\n\nWhen booking Super Sparpreis, Sparpreis and 2nd class Flexpreis tickets, you have the option of purchasing seat reservations later.\n\nIt can be worth re-looking up a journey a week or two ahead of travel, because the DB website will indicate how busy a departure will be.\n\nThough if you opt to add reservations later you will have pay the fees per train.\n\nBooking on the DB website\n\nTo see all the combinations of trains and journey options, some of which may be cheaper, take off the 'fastest connections' default.\n\nMaking the connection or extending the transfer time:\n\nThese journey times and the associated train specific tickets are are all dependent on making a transfer between ICE trains in Frankfurt (Main) station of around 15 mins.\n\nThis connection is not guaranteed - it is not particularly unusual for the trains from Paris to arrive late into Frankfurt (Main) hbf station.\n\nIF the ICE does arrive too late - then tickets/reservations can be swapped free of charge to subsequent connections at the Reisezentrum travel desk\n\nOR minimise your chances of encountering this stressful scenario, by using the transfer tool on the DB home page\n\nYou can then book journey options which allow more than 30min to make the transfers between trains; though the connections you will then be offered can involve making the transfer between trains at other stations than Frankfurt (Main() hbf.\n\nAnd these alternative routings can be more expensive.\n\nRail Pass Users:\n\nTravelling with a rail pass\n\nIf you will be making this journey with a Eurail or InterRail pass then make reservations on a train to Frankfurt (Main) and make the connections there.\n\nIt's an exceptionally easy station in which to change trains and you won't have to make any reservations on trains between Frankfurt (Main)\n\nMeaning that if the train from Paris arrives on time you can often gamble on making a 3-4 minute connection into a different ICE service on to Berlin, the tightly timed connection means that ticket bookers aren't given this option.\n\nIf you gamble and lose there will be another train on to Berlin within 15 minutes.\n\nReservations when using rail passes:\n\nIf you have a rail pass the best option is to book the reservation on a DB-SNCF train from Paris to Frankfurt (Main) â youâll need to do this before you board this train\n\nAnd then on arrival in Frankfurt (Main) you can either:\n\n(1) hop on the next ICE train to Berlin â and hope that can find spare seats on the train (itâs more likely that you will, than you wonât).\n\n(2) Use a DB ticket machine or stop by the Reisezentrum travel desk at Frankfurt (Main) and book reservations on the next ICE to Berlin\n\n(3) Book the reservations on the Frankfurt to Berlin ICE before you leave Paris; and then IF you miss the connection you are booked on to, because the train from Paris is delayed, you can then transfer your reservation to the next ICE train, free of charge at the Reisezentrum travel desk."
