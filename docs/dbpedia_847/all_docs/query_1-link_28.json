Instead the purpose of my trip was to a meeting for some media work – I will post more about that in due course.\n\nBut the trip gave me the opportunity to examine the bike parking at Berlin’s main station. As Amsterdam Centraal has just opened a massive new bike parking space, and Utrecht has already set a standard for this, the rather grotty outdoor bike parking at Berlin Hbf looks like this:\n\nOpen to the elements. And I would never leave my bike there overnight.\n\nCompare this to the underground car parking:\n\nI asked at the information desk if I would be allowed to leave a bike anywhere here. “Nein” was the answer."
