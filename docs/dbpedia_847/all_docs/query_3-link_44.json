        "text": "The diverse world of U- and S-Bahn in Germanyâ€™s capital\n\nSlava Shestopalov ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦\n\nÂ·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\n5 a.m. Magazine\n\nÂ·\n\n10 min read\n\nÂ·\n\nJun 7, 2020\n\n--\n\nWhat is the worldâ€™s most impressive metro? Many people would name the other-worldly Stockholm underground. My Ukrainian friends, of course, will recommend Kyiv: its pompous socialist modernist stations feature folk motifs and vaulted vestibules. Berlin doesnâ€™t top such ratings but still has quite a few stations worth visiting.\n\nAnd one more thing: I dared to give nicknames to the stations and hope theyâ€™ll make you smile. Feel free to write in the comments below which station (or nickname) you enjoyed the most.\n\n1. Three Times of the Day\n\nS BeusselstraÃŸe (opened 1894; rebuilt 1999)\n\nThe station itself is ordinary, which I cannot say about the scenery from above; itâ€™s fascinating in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Containers and brick buildings on the left are the largest city port, Westhafen.\n\n5. Firefightersâ€™ Station\n\nU Olympia-Stadion (1913)\n\nWhen I spotted these crimson doors, I couldnâ€™t think of anything other than firefighters. And this is my shadow at the bottom: give me a torch â€” Iâ€™ll be your Statue of Liberty.\n\n6. Royal Symmetry\n\nU Breitenbachplatz (1913)\n\nOwing to the lines of brass lamps and medallions on the walls, this station appears like a throne room and, probably, helps you to feel a little bit royal while commuting to a business meeting.\n\n7. Purple Valley\n\nS Olympiastadion (opened 1909; rebuilt 1935â€“1936)\n\nI still havenâ€™t guessed what made these spacious platforms look so distinctly purple â€” the tint of station lamps or the sunset.\n\n13. Postmodernist Poetry\n\nU Westhafen (1961)\n\nThis stationâ€™s walls are covered with black and red letters, and you can confuse this place with a contemporary art exhibition a-la Viennaâ€™s MUMOK or New Yorkâ€™s MoMA but without an entrance fee.\n\nBy the way, while editing photos and writing descriptions, I was thinking about which station could be my most-most favorite. Should it be something old-fashioned, traditional or clean, minimalistic? Westhafen resonates perfectly with my tastes â€” tells a story but is not too naive.\n\n19. Babylonian Trams\n\nU KlosterstraÃŸe (1913)\n\nSaturated yellow-light lamps make this station the most unfavorable for taking photos; however, many things are worth gazing at here.\n\nThe station vestibule is decorated with tiles inspired by the Ishtar Gate from ancient Babylon (now exposed in the Pergamon Museum). And on the walls, youâ€™ll see 20 enamel panels revealing the history of public transport from vintage horse-powered trams to modern-day trains."
