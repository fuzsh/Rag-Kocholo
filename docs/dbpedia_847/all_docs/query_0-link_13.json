        "text": "100 years of emotional history\n\nLooking back at our moving history:\n\nThe Beginning: the Prussian Railway\n\nThe first Prussian railway line, which connected Berlin over Zehlendorf with Potsdam, was built. Over the following years, more and more districts of the city connected to this network.\n\nBerlin's Rail Traffic: a Success Story\n\nBy the end of the century, the network of railways in Berlin comprised 412 km, 114 stations, with up to 1,142 trains operating on weekdays.\n\nThe Electric Train Operation Begins\n\nIn April 1900, the Prussian Railway launched its first electrical trial operations with 750 volts DC on the Wannsee railway during night breaks. On August 1, 1900, the time had come: the electric train operation between the Wannsee station and Zehlendorf station was in operation.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung DB AG/Wolfgang Stephan\n\nThe Birth of the S-Bahn Berlin\n\nShortly after the end of World War I, plans to expand the rail network continued in Berlin. The goal was to power new lines. A total of six experimental railcars of AEG rolled along the route from Stettin suburban railway station to Bernau. The date became the \"official birth of the S-Bahn Railway\". The end station was later named after the production series, „Bernau“.\n\nThe Unit Train Rolls Down the Tracks\n\nIntroduction of the unit train vehicle concept (which is still in use to this day): eight equal-length cars form a complete train.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der DB AG/ Wolfgang Stephan\n\nA Classic is on the Move\n\nThe S-bahn railway put the “City Train” design into operation. This was the first time they took on the red-yellow color theme. This type of vehicle shaped the image of the S-Bahn railway for nearly seven decades. In 1997, the trains operated their last courses into well-deserved retirement.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der DB AG, Max Krajewsky\n\nTimeless and Beautiful: the Introduction of the S-Bahn Logo\n\nThe Reichsbahn Director introduced the S-Bahn logo for the Fast-City-train. It is still debated whether the \"S\" stands for Schnellbahn (fast train) or Stadtbahn (city train). The mystery remains unsolved.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der DB AG\n\nThe S-Bahn Network Continues to Grow\n\nIn the early 1930s, the S-Bahn network developed rapidly: in 1933, electrification was completed with the Wannseebahn, and 1934 began with the construction of the north-south suburban railway tunnel. In September 1936, the Humboldthain to Unter den Linden route opened.\n\nRapid Development and propaganda\n\nThe S-Bahn experienced a rapid development and heyday, it is considered a symbol of modern mobility. At the same time, the influence of the Nazi dictatorship began to make itself felt from 1933 onwards. The construction of the north-south tunnel, for example, was used for propaganda purposes.\n\nExpansion of Electrical Operating Service\n\nApproximately 262 kilometers of route network are converted into modern and environmentally friendly electrical operations.\n\nWorld War ll\n\nOn April 15, 1939, a few months before World War ll broke out, the second route of the north-south suburban railway was put into operation. Further routes were installed until September 1943. However, as the war progressed, the operation of the S-Bahn suffered. At the beginning of April 1945, traffic was suspended on more and more sections of the line. At the end of April, service came to a complete standstill. The S-Bahn ring was now the front line.\n\nHighest Number of Vehicles\n\nWith 1140 quarter trains, the S-Bahn Berlin has the highest number of vehicles to date and reaches a passenger record with 737 million passengers.\n\nConsequences of War\n\nOn April 25th, the S-Bahn operations come to a complete standstill due to the fighting in Berlin; there is no power supply due to lack of coal. At the end of the war, about 90 percent of the trains are destroyed or not operational.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der DB AG\n\nThe Demolition of the North-South Tunnel\n\nIn the final days of the war, the reinforced concrete tunnel ceiling of the North-South S-Bahn tunnel beneath the Landwehr Canal was blown up. It is still not clear who did it and why. The tunnel was destroyed over a length of almost one hundred meters. The waterline burst and spilled from the Anhalter station, over Potsdamer Platz up to the stations Unter den Linden, Oranienburger Straße, and Stettiner station (today's Nordbahnhof). At Friedrichstrasse station, the water flood also reached the subway system. Many people who had sought shelter in the stations from the atrocities of the war had drowned.\n\nThe S-Bahn in the Turmoil of the Postwar Period\n\nThe S-Bahn irregularly began service again on the first route section between Wannsee and Schöneberg. Soon, the red and yellow trains carried around 420 million passengers a year, which comprised one third of public transportation in Berlin.\n\nBerlin Divided\n\nDespite the divide in East and West Berlin, the S-Bahn continues to travel beyond the sector borders.\n\nConstruction Boom\n\nIn the late 1940s and in the 1950s numerous Berlin S-Bahn lines were extended and lengthened. The first section was Mahlsdorf-Hoppegarten, the construction boom ended in 1956 with the connection from Strausberg to Strausberg Nord.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der Deutschen Bahn AG\n\nThe Construction of the Wall Separates Berlin\n\nThe construction of the wall begins. Berlin and its public transportation systems were massively affected by the divide. S-Bahn and U-Bahn traffic were interrupted due to the border closings. The Friedrichstraße railway station was turned into a strictly secured border crossing. Two independent S-Bahn systems were created, both operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (state railway of the GDR).\n\nThe S-Bahn Boycott in West Berlin\n\nPoliticians and unions called in response to the S-Bahn boycott in West Berlin. Back then, the operator of the S-Bahn was the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which was located in the east of the city but responsible for both jurisdictions. The solidarity gesture was to prevent the \"Western money\" of the fare revenues from being used to finance the construction of the Wall. The boycott was well received: Within a very short time, the number of S-Bahn passengers in West Berlin's public transportation system no longer played a significant role.\n\n©\n\nHans Schubert\n\nRise in the East\n\nWhile the S-Bahn lost importance in the West Berlin, it remained an important means of transportation in the Eastern part of the city. Passenger numbers reached up to 1.2 million passengers for the Tenth World Festival, a new high point.\n\nStrike in the West\n\nIn 1980, the West Berlin employees of the German Reichsbahn went on strike. The reason: A wave of lay-offs were carried out by the Deutsche Reichsbahn against employees based in West Berlin. Afterwards, many strikers were denounced, others did not voluntarily return to work. Due to the shortage of staff, the Deutsche Reichsbahn in West Berlin could only offer limited S-Bahn traffic covering up to 73 kilometers. Routes such as the Ringbahn, the Wannsee train and the connection to Spandau were sent into hibernation.\n\nThe BVG Takes Control\n\nAn agreement was settled between the German Reichsbahn and the Berlin Senate for the hand-over of operating rights from the West Berlin S-Bahn to the BVG. This was in effect by January 9, 1984. At this time, only 8,000 to 10,000 people daily used the red and yellow trains in the Western part of the city.\n\n©\n\nUdo Dittfurth\n\nTriumph and Voluntary Overtime During the Fall of the Berlin Wall\n\nOn the night of November 9th to 10th, the fall of the Berlin Wall sent Germany into a collective celebration. Especially in Berlin, people flocked to the crossing points of the border, where the mass transit system was literally overrun. Many train drivers volunteered for additional services and put in countless overtime hours allowing the trains to run all night.\n\nContinuous Operation on the City Train\n\nOn July 2, 1990 S-Bahn City Trains were back in service. Starting on September 1st, they also stopped at the underground \"ghost stations\" of the North-South Railway with the exception of Potsdamer Platz, which would later go into service on March 1, 1992.\n\n©\n\nHistorische Sammlung der DB AG/Werner Reiche\n\nThe Year of Track Closings\n\nThe Berlin S-Bahn put three routes back into service: Wannsee to Potsdam City, Frohnau to Hohen Neuendorf, and Lichtenrade to Blankenfelde. A few years later the routes Schönholz-Tegel-Hennigsdorf and Priesterweg-Lichterfelde-Süd as well as Westkreuz-Pichelsberg-Spandau were reactivated.\n\n©\n\nJoachim Donath\n\nThe Industrial Expansion\n\nA further merger took place with the fusion of the German Federal Railways (Deutscher Bundesbahn) and German Reichsbahn to Deutsche Bahn AG. With the founding of the new company, the operating rights for the West Berlin routes of the S-Bahn were handed over from the BVG to the Deutsche Bahn AG.\n\nHappy Birthday, S-Bahn Berlin GmbH\n\nThe S-Bahn Berlin was created as a limited liability company.\n\n©\n\nDavid Ulrich\n\nWedding Day at the S-Bahn Berlin\n\nThe last section of the Ringbahn has been completed and celebrated with a big Wedding Day in the Wedding district. With the commissioning of the route from Westhafen to the Schönhauser Allee, the Ring was now fully in service after almost 41 years.\n\n©\n\nJoachim Donath\n\nTrain Fleet Makeover\n\nWithin ten years, many S-Bahn trains up to 70 years old were replaced by 500 new 481 series trains. If the average life of a train was 43 years in 1995, and only 8 years in 2006. The acquisition of the new trains of the 481 series cost about 1.2 billion euros.\n\nVehicle Crisis\n\nManufacturer-related vehicle defects and management errors in the company led the S-Bahn Berlin into a crisis that resulted in performance restrictions. A new management which worked with additional staff and extended workshop capacities to repair defects was put into effect. Other divisions of Deutsche Bahn supported this change by providing more employees and benefits. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, in an effort to restore passenger satisfaction, the S-Bahn Berlin spent over 140 million euros. In total, Deutsche Bahn invested 400 million euros in the new vehicle fleet.\n\nAlliance with DB Regio\n\nThe S-Bahn Berlin and its trains become part of DB Regio AG.\n\n©\n\nDavid Ulrich\n\n\"90 Years Uniting Berlin\"\n\nThe anniversary is inspired by the motto \"90 Years Uniting Berlin\". The S-Bahn Berlin launched christening campaigns to express its commitment to the region, the population, and to its passengers.\n\n©\n\nStjepan Sedlar\n\nTransportation Contract Signing\n\nRailway and political representatives signed the transportation contract for the Ring/South-East subnetwork and ordered 382 new S-Bahn production series 483/484 trains from the manufacturer consortium Siemens/Stadler.\n\n©\n\nbüro+staubach\n\nInvestment in the Future: Presentation of the New 483/484 Series\n\nInvestments of 900 million euros in the train fleet of the S-Bahn Berlin take shape. In October 2016 with the series 483/484 was presented as a genuine highlight (timeline).\n\n©\n\nChristiane Flechtner\n\nFirst new trains in regular passenger service\n\nInitial field testing of the new S-Bahn trains commenced on 1 January. The first ten pre-production trains were trialled in regular passenger service on the S47 line between Spindlersfeld and Hermannstraße. In August, the field test was completed successfully and regular operation began.\n\n©\n\nDominic Dupont/DB AG\n\nNew S-Bahn series proves itself\n\nAfter the new S-Bahn had already been in service on lines S46 (since 27 June 2022) and S8 (since 14 October 2022), it was put into service on the S41 and S42 Ringbahn lines ahead of schedule on 11 December 2022, as the manufacturers Stadler and Siemens Mobiliy made faster progress with production than planned.\n\nLogin\n\nLogin\n\nE-Mail-Adresse\n\nPassword\n\nForgot password?"
