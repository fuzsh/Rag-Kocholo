        "text": "Paris Nord's status is partially due to its role as one of the city's main commuter hubs; though the RER and Transillien trains, which serve locations close to Paris, use different parts of the stations to the long distance trains.\n\nThe station is an enormous complex with multiple access points to/from the trains, particularly if you will be transferring between the RER / Metro and the part of the station which the high speed trains use.\n\nTherefore the Gare Du Nord houses numerous shortcuts - very convenient for its regular users, but somewhat confusing if you're not familiar with the station.\n\nIt also houses a fairly large mall, which functions like a magnet to the youths who live to the north of the city centre.\n\nThe station also lives up to its name in two ways:\n\n(1) It is located to the north of the city centre, in what isn't the smartest area of town (particularly on either side of the station).\n\nSo the more popular areas of the city are a Metro, RER, bus or taxi ride away.\n\n(2) It does indeed serve destinations to the north of Paris.\n\nIn addition to the Eurostar (blue) trains to the UK and the Eurostar (red) trains to Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands, the TGV trains to towns and cities in northern France also depart from here.\n\nThe Gare Du Nord is served by two Metro lines, the Line 4 and the Line 5.\n\nLine 4\n\nThe Line 4 is the primary public transport link between the Gare du Nord and the heart of Paris, hence it is typically very busy\n\nIt's stop at CitÃ© takes its name from its location on the Ãle de la CitÃ© in the middle of The River Seine, which is the island on which Notre Dame cathedral is located.\n\nThough taking the RER line B can often be a quicker option than taking the Line 4 - see below.\n\nAt ChÃ¢telet station the Line 4 has comparatively convenient connections with Line 1 and Line 14.\n\nLine 5\n\nThe Line 5 links the Gare Du Nord to the eastern side of central Paris and it has stops at the Place de la RÃ©publique and the Place de la Bastille.\n\nby RER\n\nThe RER is a system of mainline trains which cross central Paris and link areas on opposite sides of the city and three of its five routes are available at the Gare Du Nord.\n\nIt provides faster access to some areas of the city also served by Metro line 4 - And also provides the transfer to areas in central Paris which aren't linked to the Gare Du Nord by Metro.\n\nThe voies (platforms / tracks) in the part of the station used by the line B and D trains are arranged into pairs, 'Nord' and 'Sud'.\n\nLooking into the station from the RER ticket hall.\n\nThe left of the Nord platform is used by line B trains heading to destinations including Aeroport CDG.\n\nThe right of the Nord platform is by line D trains heading to the likes of St Denis and Chantilly.\n\nThe left of the Sud platform is used by line D trains heading to the Gare de Lyon and beyond.\n\nThe right of the Sud is used by Line B trains heading to St Michel-Notre Dame and Antony for Orly Airport.\n\nBoth Line B and Line D link the Gare Du Nord to ChÃ¢telet - the RER station is named ChÃ¢telet-Les Halles as it is on the lower level of the Les-Halles shopping mall.\n\nLine B has a stop named Saint-Michel Notre-Dame which lives up to its name with a location just across the River Seine from the Notre Dame cathedral; And it also calls at Luxembourg station which is within a five minute walk of the Pantheon.\n\nThe Line E station at the Gare Du Nord is named Magenta, but it is accessed by a comparatively short passage way.\n\nLine E provides direct access to and from the area around St Lazare - And it also now provides a direct link between the Gare Du Nord and the the La DÃ©fense business district.\n\nto the main tourist attractions from the Gare Du Nord\n\nA quirk of Gare Du Nord is that it has comparatively few direct links to the most popular tourist attractions in Paris:\n\nThe Eiffel tower = take the RER line B between the Gare Du Nord and Saint-Michel Notre-Dame and connect at that station with RER line C which goes to and from the station named Champ Du Mars Tour Eiffel.\n\nthe Sacre Couer and Montmartre = take Metro line 4 between the Gare Du Nord and the station named BarbÃ¨s - Rochechouart, transfer with Line 2 which goes to and from the station named Anvers.\n\nthe Louvre Museum = take Metro line 5 between the Gare Du Nord and the Gare de l'Est, transfer with Line 7 which goes to and from a station named Palais Royal - MusÃ©e du Louvre.\n\nthe MusÃ©e d'Orsay = take the RER line B between the Gare Du Nord and Saint-Michel Notre-Dame and connect at that station with RER line C which goes to and from the station named MusÃ©e d'Orsay.\n\nthe Pompidou Centre = take the Metro line 5 between the Gare Du Nord and Republique and connect at that station with line 11 which goes to and from the station named Rambuteau.\n\nThe events of the Paris Olympics 2024 are being staged at 23 separate venues across the French capital.\n\nHence a decision to focus on how to travel by train to the venues not in the heart of Paris from the Gare Du Nord\n\nTo the Stade De France\n\nIf your seats are in blocks are on the south and east sides of the stadium = Blocks A, R, S, T, U, X, Y and Z, the station named La Plaine Stade de France on RER line B has the shortest walking distance of around 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nIf you will be sitting on the western side of the stadium = Blocks, K, L and N, the shortest and easiest walking route is from the station named Stade De France â Saint Denis on RER line D, despite it being the farthest of the three stations from the stadium.\n\nThough bus line/route 353 is a five stop ride to the stadium and its stop is by blocks U, X and Y.\n\nThe RER trains on line B and line D will depart from opposite sides of the same platform (RER Nord) - Both lines will have trains departing every 5 to 10 mins.\n\nIf your seats are on the northern side of the stadium = blocks C, D, E. G, H and J an option is to remain on the train one stop beyond to the station confusingly named St Denis and transfer to Tram line T8 - The tram stop is straight ahead from the station exit, on the other side of a bridge which spans a canal.\n\nTram line T8 goes to a stop named Saint Denis-Porte De Paris.\n\nTo the Aquatics Centre\n\nThe Aquatics Centre is within a 15 - 20 min walk from the Stade De France â Saint Denis station, which is a one stop hop on RER Line D.\n\nTo the Bercy Arena\n\nThe Bercy Arena is located within a 20 minute walk of the Gare de Lyon.\n\nTake RER Line D to the Gare de Lyon - and from there either walk or transfer to Metro Line 14 for a one stop hop to Bercy metro station.\n\nTo ChÃ¢teau de Versailles\n\nThe equestrian arena for the Paris Olympics is located towards the western edge of the chÃ¢teau grounds.\n\nIt is a three step journey:\n\ntake RER line B (Sud) to St Michel-Notre Dame\n\ntake RER (line C) trains heading to Saint-Quentin en Yvelines and leave these trains at St Cyr\n\ntake Tram line / route T13 to its stop named AllÃ©e Royale.\n\nTo Le Bourget\n\nThe sport climbing venue is north-east of the city centre.\n\nTake RER Line B direct to Le Bourget station\n\nTo the North Paris Arena\n\nThe North Paris Arena is located in the Villepinte Exhibition Centre on the northern edge of Paris by CDG Airport.\n\nTake RER Line B direct to Parc des Expositions station\n\nTo the La DÃ©fense Swimming Arena in Nanterre\n\nThe venue for the indoor swimming races is located to the west of the La DÃ©fense business and shopping area.\n\nIt's closest rail station is the brand new Nanterre-La-Folie, the current western terminus of RER Line E.\n\nUse the passage way in the station to access Magenta station and take the RER line E direct to Nanterre-La-Folie.\n\nTo the Porte de la Chapelle Arena\n\nThe venue for badminton and rhythmic gymmastics is located within easy distance of the metro station, from which it takes its name.\n\nTram line / route T3b also stops a couple of minutes walls from the venue - which is typically named the Adidas Arena.\n\nIt is a two step journey:\n\nUse the passage way in the station to access Magenta station and take the RER line E to Rosa Parks station\n\nTransfer to tram line / route T3b and leave it at the Porte de la Chapelle stop\n\nTo the Stade Garros\n\nThe iconic tennis venue will also used for some of the boxing tournament at the Paris Olympics.\n\nEither\n\nTake a Metro Line 4 train to BarbÃ¨s - Rochechouart\n\nTransfer to a Line 2 train to Porte Dauphine\n\nTransfer to an Olympics 24 shuttle bus.\n\nOR\n\nTake a Metro line 4 train to Strasbourg St Denis\n\nTake a Metro line 9 to Michel-Ange Molitor station.\n\nTo the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome\n\nThe track cycling venue for the Paris Olympics is located in a town on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nIt is a two step journey:\n\ntake RER line B (Sud) to St Michel-Notre Dame\n\ntake RER line C trains to Saint-Quentin en Yvelines station\n\nTo the South Paris Arena\n\nThis venue is located at the Paris Expo Exhibition centre in the south west corner of the city.\n\nIt is a two step journey:\n\ntake RER line B (Sud) to CitÃ© Universitaire station\n\ntake tram route / line 3a to its stop at Porte de Versailles\n\nTo the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium\n\nThe hockey venue is the original sports stadium for the Paris area, but it is located in the suburb of Colombes.\n\nThe closest station, Le Stade, takes its name from the stadium, but it is a 15 - 20 min walk.\n\nThere are two options:\n\nThe faster is:\n\nUse the passage way in the Gare Du Nord to access Magenta station and take the RER line E to its first stop at Hausmann-St Lazare\n\nUse the passage ways to head to the concourse at St Lazare station\n\nTake a train to Le Stade station, which will be heading to Ermont - Eaubonne\n\nThe easier alternative is:\n\nTake a Transilien H train from the Gare Du Nord to Ermont - Eaubonne\n\nConnect there for a Transilien J train to Le Stade station\n\nThe RER concourse is at a lower level, at the far left of the main concourse, when facing away from the trains.\n\nThe sign posting isn't the best and you may need to thread your way through the queues of people waiting for Thalys trains.\n\nHowever, turning left and then heading straight ahead to the far side of the station is usually the easiest option for making this transfer.\n\nThat's because you can't miss the atrium that leads down to the RER and Metro station - this is also the easiest route to follow to the Metro.\n\nWhen you have reached the atrium leading to the RER and Metro, which is on the far left of the main concourse, you will see an escalator leading downwards.\n\nAt the foot of this escalator;\n\ngo ahead for RER lines B and D\n\nturn right for RER line E (the line E station at Gare Du Nord is named 'Magenta')\n\ngo sharp right for the Metro lines\n\nThere are also lifts available, look out for the 'Ascenseur' signs.\n\nThe alternative route to the Metro\n\nTowards the back of the Hall 1 concourse, opposite the voies/platforms/tracks used by the Eurostar (red) trains, there is another entrance to the Metro which can only be accessed by stairs\n\nIt leads to a passage way under the Hall 1 concourse , which is a short-cut from this concourse to the Metro, particularly to Line 4.\n\nThis passage way also houses multiple Metro ticket machines and a Metro ticket counter - though it is only staffed at certain times of day.\n\nEight Things Worth Keeping in Mind if you will be connecting to the Metro or RER at the Gare Du Nord:\n\n(1) The RER is the commuter rail system in Paris in which full size trains cross the city in tunnels - so in central Paris they have stations underground.\n\n(2) At the Gare Du Nord the RER Line D is by far the quickest option if you're heading to the Gare De Lyon, or the area around it.\n\nAlternatively RER line B provides the train service between the Gare Du Nord and the two main airports in Paris - Charles De Gaulle and Orly.\n\n(3) if you will be heading to the Left Bank area of the city (the south bank of The Seine), then taking RER line B is usually a better option than taking the Metro.\n\nLine B stops at St Michel-Notre Dame - where connections are also available to RER line C, which stops at the MusÃ©e DâOrsay and Champs de Mars-Tour Eiffel.\n\n(4) Gare Du Nord is served by MÃ©tro lines Line 4 and Line 5 .\n\nLine 4 stops at:\n\nEtienne Marcel station, which is a 5 - 10 min walk from the Pompidou Centre\n\nCitÃ© station, which is right by Notre-Dame cathedral\n\nThough as can be seen on the Metro map neither of these lines head west, so if your final destination is on the western edge of the city centre, making the one-stop hop on RER Line E to St Lazare can be the best option.\n\n(5) It's a good idea to work out which Metro or RER line you will be taking before arriving at Paris Gare Du Nord.\n\nMetro/RER maps at Gare Du Nord can be tricky to track down.\n\n(6) Think twice about taking the Metro or RER if you have heavy luggage etc.\n\nThe majority of exits and interchanges on the Metro are NOT step free.\n\nIn the RER station at the Gare Du Nord, if the elevators down to the RER lines B and D platforms are out of order, you will have to use the stairs to access the trains, as there are no down escalators.\n\nAlso the majority of the ticket barriers at Metro/RER stations donât accommodate large bags - and there are no luggage racks on the invariably crowded Metro trains.\n\n(7) A zone 1 single journey ticket is valid for the RER or Metro - there are no specific RER tickets.\n\nThere are numerous ticket machines on the RER concourse, so many that the queues for the ticket office can be shorter â though the ticket booking counters can be closed in the afternoon/evenings.\n\nThe ticket machines have good English translation â but look out for the easy to miss âconfirm your purchase buttonâ.\n\nYou can also book multiple tickets â useful if you will also be using the RER on a return journey.\n\n(8) The platforms/voies in the RER station station have been brightened up and there also usually numerous station staff on the platforms; which has made the RER station much more user friendly.\n\nAt the Gare Du Nord the Eurostar services to London depart from voies (platforms/tracks) 3-6.\n\nAs the signposting at Gare Du Nord is comparatively poor, what can be bewildering is that when you enter the station, you can see these Eurostar (blue) trains right beside the main street level concourse, but you cannot access the trains directly from this concourse.\n\nInstead the Eurostar UK departure hall, the âHall du Londresâ, is at an upper level - above the main concourse.\n\nSo when you enter Gare Du Nord don't head towards the trains - the direct link between the voies (platforms/tracks) 3-6 and the main Hall 1 concourse is only used when arriving by Eurostar\n\nThis âHall du Londresâ, has now been designated as the Hall 2, so follow the signs to the Hall 2 when navigating the station\n\nThe access to this upper level is actually some distance from the voies (platforms/tracks) that the Eurostars to London depart from.\n\nThe escalators and elevators (ascenseur) leading up to Eurostar UK departures are located on the opposite side of the concourse to voies (platforms/tracks) 14 - 15.\n\nLook out for the Union Jack on the rear wall of the station concourse.\n\nDon't wait on the main concourse for the departure details of a train to London to be confirmed - head directly for the check-in desks as soon as you arrive at the the Gare Du Nord.\n\nChecking In for the Eurostar to London at Gare Du Nord:\n\nEurostar is currently recommending that that Standard Class And Standard Premier ticket holders should be at the Eurostar departure area 90-120 mins before departure; and that Business Premier ticket holders should be there 45-60 mins prior to departure.\n\nThe departure gates will close 30 mins prior to departure for Standard Class And Standard Premier ticket holders; and 15 mins prior to departure for Business Premier ticket holders.\n\nIt is up to you to allow time to pass through check-in and board the train.\n\nThough SMTJ once arrived at check-in with a Standard Class ticket only 20 minutes before departure time, as a truck had hit a railway bridge, which has caused big delays to the RER Line B trains.\n\nThe check-in staff were aware of the situation and couldn't have been more helpful, I was offered a ticket on the next train, but thanks to their efficiency I made it on to my booked departure just in time.\n\nAt the Gare Du Nord, the Metro and RER stations now share a bright and airy atrium which links the parts of the station that they use, with the main concourse above.\n\nUsing it is now the easiest to follow route between these RER trains and the express trains.\n\nIt is at a lower level from where the main line trains depart - but there are escalators and lifts up to the main concourse.\n\nWhen you ascend up into the main part of the station, which you will see above you, you'll need to head to the other side of the concourse for the express train - this concourse is the Hall 1.\n\nThe atrium is located on the side of the Hall 3 concourse which is used by the commuter trains.\n\nIf you arrive at the Gare Du Nord by RER, depending on what route you take to exit the RER part of the station, you MAY find yourself in a fairly smart shopping mall.\n\nThis can be a tad disconcerting as it won't seem like you're in a station at all.\n\nThe signs in this mall pointing the way to 'Grand Lignes', which you need to follow to the high speed departures, can be hard to spot; most people will be heading for the commuter trains.\n\nBut once you find these signs keep walking ahead - You may see other 'Grandes Lignes' entrances over to the right, but ignore these short cuts; which is for the benefit of regular users of the TGV trains.\n\nIt can be a long-ish walk, but ultimately you will find yourself in the atrium, which leads up in to the main part of the station, which you will see above you."
