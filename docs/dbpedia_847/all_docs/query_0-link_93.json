It is now Saturday 31st July 2004, and I am ready to go back to the continent. I will go through London Heathrow, fly to Milan's Linate Airport by British Midland Airlines, take a bus to San Babila, then a metro to Loreto, near my hotel. I will also dare to eat at Biffi, as well as somewhere near Duomo - note, those are notorious tourist traps. In the meantime I will at least try to take the train to Switzerland and see if the Foxtown mall in Mendrisio is even open. Hope you will join me.\n\nDia daoibh, Fáilte go Lá 7 de mo chuairt ar an Eoraip i Samhradh 2004. Is é an Satharn 31 Iúil 2004 anois, agus táim réidh le dul ar ais chuig an mór-roinn. Rachaidh mé trí London Heathrow, eitilt go hAerfort Linate Milan ag British Midland Airlines, tógfaidh mé bus go San Babila, ansin meitreo go Loreto, in aice le m'óstán. Beidh leomh agam freisin ithe ag Biffi, chomh maith le áit éigin in aice le Duomo - tabhair faoi deara, is gaistí iomráiteach turasóireachta iad sin. Idir an dá linn déanfaidh mé iarracht ar a laghad an traein a thógáil go dtí an Eilvéis agus féachaint an bhfuil ionad Foxtown i Mendrisio oscailte fiú. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tú páirteach liom.\n\nCiao a tutti, Benvenuti al settimo giorno della mia visita in Europa nell'estate del 2004. Ora è sabato 31 luglio 2004 e sono pronto a tornare nel continente. Attraverserò Londra Heathrow, volerò all'aeroporto di Milano Linate con la British Midland Airlines, prenderò un autobus per San Babila, poi una metropolitana per Loreto, vicino al mio hotel. Oserò anche mangiare al Biffi, così come da qualche parte vicino al Duomo - nota, quelle sono famigerate trappole per turisti. Nel frattempo proverò almeno a prendere il treno per la Svizzera e vedere se il centro commerciale Foxtown a Mendrisio è aperto. Spero che vi unirete a me.\n\nBonjour à tous, Bienvenue au septième jour de ma visite en Europe cet été 2004. Nous sommes le samedi 31 juillet 2004 et je suis prête à retourner sur le continent. Je passerai par Heathrow à Londres, je prendrai l'avion pour l'aéroport de Milan Linate avec British Midland Airlines, je prendrai un bus jusqu'à San Babila, puis un métro jusqu'à Loreto, près de mon hôtel. J'oserai aussi manger au Biffi, ainsi que quelque part près du Duomo - attention, ce sont des pièges à touristes notoires. En attendant, je vais au moins essayer de prendre le train pour la Suisse et voir si le centre commercial Foxtown à Mendrisio est même ouvert. J'espère que vous me rejoindrez.\n\nHallo zusammen, Willkommen zu Tag 7 meiner Europareise im Sommer 2004. Es ist jetzt Samstag, der 31. Juli 2004, und ich bin bereit, auf den Kontinent zurückzukehren. Ich werde über London Heathrow fliegen, mit British Midland Airlines zum Mailänder Flughafen Linate, einen Bus nach San Babila nehmen und dann mit der U-Bahn nach Loreto, in der Nähe meines Hotels. Ich werde mich auch trauen, bei Biffi zu essen, sowie irgendwo in der Nähe des Doms – wohlgemerkt, das sind berüchtigte Touristenfallen. In der Zwischenzeit werde ich zumindest versuchen, mit dem Zug in die Schweiz zu fahren und zu sehen, ob das Einkaufszentrum Foxtown in Mendrisio überhaupt geöffnet hat.\n\nIch hoffe, Sie begleiten mich.\n\nVery early Saturday morning the 31st July 2004, I was sleeping in my bed inside a dorm room meant for 6 males. At the time, I was the only person in the room. About 5 AM, there were a couple of young men who entered, and one complained about me being in their bed. Some people are so rigid, that they must have the same exact bed, as they are assigned. It was about time for me to leave the room anyway, since I had a flight to catch about 9 AM that morning, from the Dublin International Airport. I took a shower and took all my belongings down with me, and checked out of the hostel. Then I walked to the bus stop that had a direct route to the airport, passing by Parnell Square and Drumcondra rail station. It was basically a north-northeast bus ride. For part of the route, the bus went along the M-50 and eventually became the M-1 to Belfast.\n\nThe bus turned left at the next interchange, and I think I was dropped off at the first terminal. I checked in my bag to Milano Linate, and then had some proper Full Irish breakfast at a cafe before the security gates. I had ordered one or two fried eggs, two strips of bacon, two slices of regular sausage, two slices of black and white pudding, a tomato and baked beans. I also had tea, coffee and a breadroll. The breadroll was extra. The sugar packets had English and Irish Gaelic quotes written on them. I believe I still have a few of them remaining.\n\nI went through security and then to the gate where my plane to London Heathrow would take off from. The plane took off about 9:30 AM. It did its prerecorded safety announcement. The safety card had a cartoon of a smoking woman that reminded me of Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones. The plane was serving sandwiches, either egg and mushroom or ham and cheese. About 11:10 AM, the plane landed at Heathrow. Everyone entered the terminal, I think it was Terminal 2. No one had their passports checked, as far as I remember. The reason for this, is that the Republic of Ireland and the UK have a customs union, independent of Schengen, so they do not perform passport checks. This is in spite of the fact that both countries were, at the time, members of the European Union. The passport check union still exists to this day, absent to an act of either countries' respective parliaments.\n\nAt Heathrow, I had a layover until about 1 PM. I went outside to find the Underground station for the Pickadilly line, that I had walked to as early as March 2000 when I had the unexpected layover while trying to go to Paris CDG. I went back about 11:45 AM and spent a half hour in the BMI lounge. I had my radio and was recording BBC Radio 1.\n\nAbout 12:30 PM, it was time to board the flight. I boarded an Airbus A321, for Milan's Linate airport. The distance to Linate is greater than the distance to Dublin, almost twice the distance. The safety announcement was slightly different, there were more exits to think about. Everything else was the same, as with the flights within the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe flight touched down about 3:30 PM at Linate. Linate is due east of Milan, as opposed to Malpensa which is northwest, and significantly farther away. After I landed, using a staircar, I had to go into the non-Schengen line in the terminal, to have my passport stamped. This would be my first Schengen entry for 2004, as opposed to Heathrow airport. From then on, I would be subject to the 90 day rule, making 30th October 2004 my last day to leave the EU Schengen area. I went into the terminal to pick up my wheeled bag, then I exited the terminal. At the time, there was no M4, and there would be no rail connection until at least 2023. I had to take a local bus from Linate to San Babila to connect to M1 for Loreto. The bus left Linate about 4:30 PM and arrived at San Babila around 5:15 PM. At San Babila, I bought a 48 hour metro card for around 4.50 Euro. I took the M1 north to Loreto, four stops away. I followed the line 55 bus to Piazza Aspromonte, and I checked into my hotel. It was on the second floor, and had a ductless air conditioning system controlled by remote control. It was basically the same kind as I had the previous year (6th to 8th August 2003). I sat in the room for half an hour enjoying the air conditioning, then it was time to get out of the hotel and then ride the metro to Maciachini station.\n\nFor those who don't know about the M3, it uses trains that were, at the time, compatible with each other's lines, but the appearance of the trains is significantly different from those of the M1 and M2. Most, but not all, stations have side platforms. Some towards San Donato have a single central platform, and the ones from Duomo to Turati have platforms stacked one on top of the other. The stations also have more \"friendly\" lighting on the M3 than the M1 and M2 stations of the 1960s and 1970s, which appear darker and have that \"creepy\" feeling. Loreto in recent years had been upgraded and no longer looks quite so creepy. This is based on a visit I had between 13th and 15th September 2011.\n\nTo get to Maciachini station, I would have to follow the tram tracks to Loreto station, take the M2 to Centrale FS, then transfer to the M3. The last time I rode the M3, it was August 2003, it went only from San Donato up to Zara. Since then, one station had been constructed to the north, resulting in Maciachini. In later years, the train would be extended to Comasina. Maciachini intersects with a few tram lines, some going as far north as Bicocca and Niguarda. The station itself is little different from Sondrio or Zara, namely, with side platforms similar to that of the M1.\n\nI took the M3 to Duomo, to walk around the cathedral, and maybe a place to eat. I found a place that served spaghetti alla carbonara. I had a glass of Peroni with that, but avoided the chianti, as it would be much more expensive. For dessert, I had some coffee ice cream with a little bit of coffee. I was disappointed to see that the Virgin Megastore, across the Piazza del Duomo from the Vittorio Emanuele II building, had closed down. I would have only one place to buy CDs, namely Ricordimedia.\n\nI rode the metro for a little while, then went back to my hotel to sleep with air conditioning. The next morning, Sunday 1st August 2004, I wanted to wash my clothes, but I could not as the OndaBlu that I went to in April 2001, had gone out of business. I then decided to take a train to Mendrisio, in Switzerland. I had my Eurail pass with me. I took the M2 to Centrale FS, and boarded a local train that had limited stops in Italy, but ran as an S-Bahn in Switzerland. The train went to Monza and Como. I did not have my passport checked until Chiasso, and then, the border guards just passed by. The train left Chiasso about 11 AM and went north to Balerna, and then Mendrisio. The bus to the Foxtown mall was not running, so I had to walk all the way there. The mall was closed because it was a public holiday, being the 1st of August and National Day. There was only one thing I could do, and that was to call the hotel I would be staying in Lugano. I told them I would be coming the next day, Monday the 2nd August. They said my room would be ready the 2nd at about 1 PM to check in.\n\nI took the train back to Chiasso, and went for lunch. At Chiasso station, there is a statue of Svizzera e Italia, created by Margherita Oswald-Toppi. I saw a few things in Chiasso, for one, a display of all the cantonal flags of the different cantons of Switzerland. The Swiss national flag was seen pretty much all across Chiasso. I tried to find the pizza place that I ate at in late June 1987 when I was with family the first time I visited Chiasso, but it was a lost cause. I can't remember what I ate in Chiasso that day, but it was good. At Chiasso, I took a DMU train to Greco Pirelli and then a tram back to Duomo and Cordusio. Somewhere, I found an ice cream machine, that served me a \"straciatella\" ice cream on a sugar cone, sort of a swirl of vanilla and chocolate. It was very good. That would get me until supper, where I decided to eat at Biffi. I had heard about Biffi from my Italian textbook while at university. Biffi is located in the Vittorio Emanuele II building, close to the middle section of the mall.\n\nAfter my ice cream cone, I took the M1 to Duomo and transferred to the M3 for a train to San Donato. I had been to San Donato in July 1998 and April 2001. The station itself has three platforms, one with a side and the other with an island platform for northbound trains. San Donato is also the location of the M3 train maintenance yard to the northeast. Unfortunately San Donato Milanese FS station does not have a direct connection to the M3, and a connection at Rogoredo is necessary. I walked along Via Caviaga around the sports center, before turning right at Viale Alcide de Gasperi, then back by Via Fabiani. At that time, I was starting to get hungry, so I rode the M3 back to Duomo.\n\nThere was nothing interesting at RicordiMedia, so I decided not to buy anything there. I did go outside to see the Teatro Alla Scala. There is another similar venue in the Bicocca district, namely Teatro di Arcimboldi, close to the Bicocca university towards Sesto San Giovanni. About 8 PM it was time to have supper. I went to the Biffi in the Galeria Vittorio Emanuele II. I ordered a glass of Carlsberg pilsener. It came in a nonic glass with the Carlsberg logo on it. I also ordered a spaghetti alla carbonara as a first course, and a steak about 5 ounces or 130 grams, as a second course. There was a service charge that included a basket of sliced bread and butter, about 3.50 Euro at the time. Both the spaghetti and beef steak tasted really good. I think it cost around 39 Euro with tip. Biffi is a higher end restaurant, that I would not visit on a regular basis. In 2011 I would have a glass of chianti at a nearby restaurant costing 14 Euro, so the Duomo area is not exactly the best place to eat, if one is on a tight budget. Fast food may be less of a concern.\n\nI walked over to an ice cream parlor after supper. It was on the west side of the Duomo. I bought an ice cream cup with three flavors. It was good, maybe a little better than the ice cream cone I had earlier. About 10 PM I went back to the hotel to sleep.\n\nPlease join me tomorrow, as I take one trolleybus ride around the Porta Romana, Bocconi university, Navigli district, San Siro, Bovisa and Ca' Granda districts, before checking out, taking the train north to Lugano, riding the San Salvatore cable car system, having supper at the restaurant on top, visiting the Swiss Miniatur museum in Melide, shopping at the Fox Town mall, a visit to Campione d'Italia and supper at the Manora. Hope you will come along.\n\nDays 5 - 7: Belfast - Dublin, the start of a tram system, Grafton Street and an excellent bacon sandwich to go with my Guinness pint.\n\nHi everyone, Welcome to Day 5 of my visit to Europe in Summer 2004. It is now Thursday 29th July 2004, and I had stayed two nights in Belfast, and had gone up and down that part of the UK. It is time now to go to Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland. I have breakfast at the rail station, called \"Ulster fry\", take the international train to Dublin, stopping only at Portadown, and arriving about 10:30 AM in Dublin Connolly. I went on a walking tour from the central post office on to Grafton Street, also viewing the Book of Kells at Trinity College. I took a ride on the LUAS from St. Stephen's Green down to Sandyford and back. The next day I went on a clockwise bus tour of Dublin, walked to Drumcondra, rode the train to Dublin Connolly, took the train to Howth and back, ate supper in Howth, then took a bus back to the hostel to sleep for my next journey on 31st July. Hope you will join me.\n\nDia daoibh, Fáilte go Lá 5 de mo chuairt ar an Eoraip i Samhradh 2004. Is é Déardaoin an 29 Iúil 2004 anois, agus d'fhan mé dhá oíche i mBéal Feirste, agus chuaigh mé suas agus síos an chuid sin den RA. Tá sé in am anois dul go Baile Átha Cliath, i bPoblacht na hÉireann. Tá bricfeasta agam ag an stáisiún traenach, ar a dtugtar “Ulster fry”, tóg an traein idirnáisiúnta go Baile Átha Cliath, ag stopadh ag Port an Dúnáin amháin, agus ag teacht timpeall 10:30 AM go Baile Átha Cliath Uí Chonghaile. Chuaigh mé ar thuras siúlóide ón oifig phoist lárnach go Sráid Grafton, ag féachaint ar Leabhar Cheanannais i gColáiste na Tríonóide freisin. Thug mé turas ar an LUAS ó Fhaiche Stiabhna síos go Áth an Ghainimh agus ar ais.

Nous sommes le jeudi 29 juillet 2004 et j'ai passé deux nuits à Belfast et j'ai parcouru cette partie du Royaume-Uni de long en large. Il est temps maintenant d'aller à Dublin, en République d'Irlande. Je prends mon petit-déjeuner à la gare ferroviaire, appelée \"Ulster fry\", je prends le train international pour Dublin, je m'arrête seulement à Portadown et j'arrive vers 10h30 à Dublin Connolly. J'ai fait une visite à pied depuis la poste centrale jusqu'à Grafton Street, et j'ai également visité le Livre de Kells au Trinity College. J'ai fait un tour en LUAS de St. Stephen's Green jusqu'à Sandyford et retour. Le lendemain, j'ai fait un tour en bus dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre à travers Dublin, j'ai marché jusqu'à Drumcondra, j'ai pris le train jusqu'à Dublin Connolly, j'ai pris le train jusqu'à Howth et retour, j'ai dîné à Howth, puis j'ai pris un bus pour retourner à l'auberge pour dormir avant mon prochain voyage le 31 juillet. J'espère que vous vous joindrez à moi.\n\nHallo zusammen, Willkommen zu Tag 5 meiner Europareise im Sommer 2004. Es ist jetzt Donnerstag, der 29. Juli 2004, und ich habe zwei Nächte in Belfast verbracht und bin durch diesen Teil des Vereinigten Königreichs gereist. Jetzt ist es Zeit, nach Dublin in der Republik Irland zu fahren. Ich frühstücke am Bahnhof, das „Ulster Fry“ heißt, nehme den internationalen Zug nach Dublin, halte nur in Portadown und komme gegen 10:30 Uhr in Dublin Connolly an. Ich habe einen Spaziergang vom Hauptpostamt zur Grafton Street gemacht und mir dabei auch das Book of Kells im Trinity College angesehen. Ich bin mit der LUAS von St. Stephen’s Green nach Sandyford und zurück gefahren. Am nächsten Tag machte ich eine Bustour im Uhrzeigersinn durch Dublin, ging zu Fuß nach Drumcondra, fuhr mit dem Zug nach Dublin Connolly, nahm den Zug nach Howth und zurück, aß in Howth zu Abend und nahm dann einen Bus zurück zum Hostel, um dort für meine nächste Reise am 31. Juli zu schlafen. Ich hoffe, Sie begleiten mich.\n\nOn Thursday 29 July 2004, I had been staying at the Belfast YHA hostel. It was time to check out, and go south to Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland. I would take the international train from Belfast Lanyon Place, then called Belfast Central, and ride in first class to Dublin Connolly. The train would stop only in Portadown, just north of the border. I checked out, with my luggage, walked to the Botanic rail station, took a 80 class train to Lanyon Place station, and went upstairs to the cafe for \"Ulster Fry\". Ulster Fry is not much different from Full English breakfast, except that it has a few more fried items. I had egg, bacon, sausage, a \"potato farl\", kind of like a hash brown patty, and a fried mushroom. I had one cup of tea, and another of coffee. About 7:50 AM, I went downstairs to the platform where the train to Dublin would depart from. I found my seat in First Class. Somehow I ended up in the dining car, but did not order anything.\n\nThe train left about 8 AM. I had my radio with me, on one of the local FM stations, they played \"Ninety Miles from Dublin\" by Christy Moore. The train made a prerecorded announcement of the train arrival in Dublin Connolly in the middle of the song. Later on, I heard \"Lola's Theme\" by the Shapeshifters as well as \"Inner Smile\" by Texas (a Scottish band that started in the late 1980s but did not achieve fame until at least their \"White on Blonde\" LP in 1997 / 1998). It seemed, from Belfast to Dublin, that it would be impossible to notice the difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It was only after the train passed through Drogheda (pronounced \"Draw-dah\"), that I would notice that I was in the Republic of Ireland. The train did not make any stops between Portadown and Dublin Connolly. The weather was a bit on-and-off rainy.\n\nMost of the Irish railway system is unelectrified. Only from Howth to Bray was there any electrification on the main line, when I last read an article about the Irish railway system. I was surprised, already at Malahide there was electrification. The train was not very far from Connolly station. The train arrived about 10:30 AM on its own track. The exit was gated, so I had to go through the gates to exit the station for the bus to the hostel. I did not see any left luggage area in that station, though I have been told that there is one at the Heuston station due west of Connolly.\n\nLeaving Connolly station, the statin building itself looks like something I might have seen in Northern Italy, kind of like from the Sforza family of Milan. Across the street from Connolly Station is the Busaras, or the central bus station. I asked about how to get to the hostel, but I was told to go to O'Connell Street by Abbey Street Lower and get a city bus from there. Although the LUAS red line tracks were being tested, that line would not go into operation until at least September or October that same year (2004). I had to walk along the sidewalk following the tracks to O'Connell Street. I saw a few light rail vehicles pass by. I knew of the green line, but it would not go farther north than St. Stephen's Green for many years (in 2024 it goes as far as Broombridge).\n\nThe Central Post office is at 47 O'Connell Street Lower. In at least one of the six Ionian columns, bulletts were shot into them in the 1920's struggle for independence from Great Britain. Nearby is an obelisque and on the opposite side of the road, towards Connolly Rail Station, is a statue of the writer James Joyce, who wrote \"Ulysses\". Incidentally, James Joyce was buried in Zurich, Switzerland, which I would visit on 7th August that same year. Only in the early 2020's, did the LUAS green line start operating along O'Connell Street Lower.\n\nWhen I arrived at the post office bus stop, I found the bus route that went right to the hostel. It was about the corner of Dorset and Wellington Streets. Some time in the 2010s the actual building had been torn down, and has been replaced by university housing. I bought a day pass for the bus, which I think was 4 Euro back then. The bus went past Parnell Square before it made its stop on Dorset Street. I checked into a room with six beds. At the time, I did not see that an actual bed assignment would make any difference. Most of the time, no one minds if the wrong one might be accidentally taken. I would find out very early Saturday morning, that people would make a fuss. But for now, I would charge up my phone and my video camera, and in about an hour's time, walk to the bus stop at Blessington and Dorset, to go into downtown.\n\nAfter I alighted from the bus at the post office, I walked along O'Connell Street. I made sure I had a good photo of the James Joyce statue. Then I walked past Middle Abbey Street, then along the Liffey to The Famine Memorial, at the Talbot Memorial Bridge. Many of the statues of the Famine Memorial looked lifelike. Then I went back to the O'Connell bridge, crossed the Liffey and stopped by the Mr. Screen cinema. There was nothing playing that I wanted to particularly see, so I walked farther south to College Street and on to Grafton Street. I entered the university at Nassau Street and went north to the library past Fellow's Square. The Book of Kells did not allow any photography. I was able to notice the pages of the bible, written on calfskin using various pigmentations.\n\nLeaving the library, I went along Grafton Street to the St. Stephen's Green rail station. In general, Grafton Street is a pedestrian only passage. I passed by the Bewley's Cafe. They make good toffee sweets. At the time, the LUAS green line did not operate anywhere north of St. Stephen's Green. I walked to FitzWilliam Street Lower, along to Merrion Square. At the northwest end of the park, there was the Oscar Wilde statue. He was sitting, more like lying, on a rock, as if it were a bean bag. I walked by the Leinster House, the current seat of government for the Republic of Ireland, and also one of the ministries, probably for health and human services or similar.\n\nAt St. Stephen's Green, I bought a two ride ticket for LUAS. LUAS at the time, did not accept the bus pass, so I had to pay about 5 Euro for a day pass. I validated it, and boarded the next green line LUAS to Sandyford. The train went straight down Harcourt Street, before turning left on Adelaide Road, and turning right onto its own right of way. The LUAS went past Beechwood but somehow I had drifted off to sleep. I think it was still the jet lag. I was inspected by a fare inspector, and they said my ticket was fine. I alighted at Sandyford, the current southern terminus of the LUAS green line, and waited for the next one back to St. Stephen's Green. Once the LUAS arrived at St Stephens Green, I walked up Grafton Street, past the O'Connell Bridge to the post office, took the bus to Dorset Street, then went to the hostel. I think I went to sleep after that. I don't remember doing much else, other than listen to the radio and record local station broadcasts, some in English, some in Irish Gaelic.\n\nOn Friday 30th July 2004, it was a much nicer day than Thursday the 29th. I woke up, took a shower, and went downstairs to eat breakfast. The \"Full Irish Breakfast\" was at an extra charge, where the continental one was included in my stay. I went for the Full Irish breakfast, but it did not contain any black and white pudding, which is like a blood sausage, or a morcillo for those who know about Spanish sausages. I would hope to go into town and maybe have some black and white pudding, but I eventually waited for the next day.\n\nI took the bus to the post office on O'Connell Street Upper, buying a day pass. There was a hop on hop off bus stop, where I could buy a ticket, good for all day transit on the hop on hop off bus. I had to wait until 10:20 AM until the bus departed. The bus went along the route past Parnell Square, the Obelisque, and back again south of the Liffey. The bus went past Trinity College, the house that Bram Stoker of \"Dracula\" fame once lived, the Molly Malone statue, St. Patrick's Cathedral, St. James Hospital, the Guinness Brewery, Magazine Fort, Heuston Station, and Ha'Penny Bridge. I alighted at Ha'Penny Bridge, and looked for some place to eat. On Anglesea Street just off Fleet Street, I found the Oliver St. John Gogarty pub. It also operated a hostel next door. I ordered a pint of Guinness and a bacon sandwich with fries. It was very good.\n\nI went down the Grafton Street walkway before turning back and taking a bus to the post office. I bought some stamps for postcards at the office. Somehow there after I ended up walking east on Cathal Brugha Street past the Five Lamps to Clonliffe Road. I walked past the GAA Museum at Croke Park. Eventually I would end up at Drumcondra rail station. I could use my Eurail pass to gain access to the train platform for Connolly Station. The section between Drumcondra and Connolly was not electrified in 2004. I was feeling tired after walking so much. I think it was about 4 PM when I caught the train from Drumcondra to Connolly. Instead of the 80 class NIR DMU unit, I was riding on a nice commuter rail train. About where the train crossed Newcomen Bridge, the train came onto the electrified section to Bray/Greystones. At Connolly I transferred to the DART, which also recognized the Eurail Pass. It would be about 4:30 PM when I would board the train for Howth, called Binn Eadair in Irish.\n\nThe train to Howth arrived about 4:30 PM. It made about 9 stops before arriving at Howth. Howth is on a peninsula, and on the north side there is a harbor. There is also a shopping area and park close by. I had supper at the Fish Market. I think I had cod and chips along with a salad, and a pint of Guinness. It was really good, cost maybe 15 Euro. About 7 PM I went back to the Howth station to wait for the train back to downtown Dublin. Entering the station, I asked the guard if they would like to see my Eurail Pass, but he said \"not particularly\" instead of \"No\". He let me on to the platform. The train did not arrive until 7:30 PM. It departed about 7:40 PM. I stayed on the train until I arrived at Pearse Street. Pearse Street is an elevated commuter rail station. If you look eastward on Westland Row, you might think that you would be seeing a scene of \"Glengarry Glenn Ross\", where they say \"Coffee is for closers\". I took the bus back to the post office, and another one of the hostel. Then I went to sleep, at least for a while. Then I was woken up about 5 AM or so. But that's a story for another day.\n\nI hope you will join me in my next journey, from Dublin to Milan. Question: at what airport do I get my passport checked? If you know Ireland's customs union with the UK, it may likely not be at Heathrow, but please stay tuned anyway. See you then!\n\nDays 3 to 5 - Belfast, Carrick a Rede, Giants Causeway and Bushmills\n\nHi everyone, Welcome to Day 3 of my visit to Europe in Summer 2004. Up to Monday the 26th July 2004, I had been staying at my parent's then-home in California. I was there for the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Now I had to move on to Belfast, in Northern Ireland. I planned to go on the city tour, and the next day a tour of the Carrick-a-Rede Bridge as well as the Bushmills distillery. Then lastly I rode the train from Belfast Botanic to Portadown Central. On 29th July 2004 I would go by train to Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland. The weather was much cooler than in Texas, and I was fortunate enough to remain healthy.\n\nDia daoibh, Fáilte go Lá 3 de mo chuairt ar an Eoraip i Samhradh 2004. Suas go dtí Dé Luain an 26 Iúil 2004, bhí mé ag fanacht i dteach mo thuismitheoirí i gCalifornia ag an am. Bhí mé ann le haghaidh Féile Gairleoige Gilroy. Anois bhí orm bogadh ar aghaidh go Béal Feirste, i dTuaisceart Éireann. Bhí sé beartaithe agam dul ar chamchuairt na cathrach, agus an lá dár gcionn turas ar Dhroichead Charraig an Rí chomh maith le drioglann Bushmills. Ansin ar deireadh mharcaigh mé an traein ó Belfast Botanic go Port an Dúnáin Láir. Ar 29 Iúil 2004 rachainn ar an traein go Baile Átha Cliath, i bPoblacht na hÉireann. Bhí an aimsir i bhfad níos fuaire ná mar a bhí i Texas, agus bhí an t-ádh orm fanacht sláintiúil.\n\nCiao a tutti, Benvenuti al terzo giorno della mia visita in Europa nell'estate del 2004. Fino a lunedì 26 luglio 2004, ero stato ospite a casa dei miei genitori in California. Ero lì per il Gilroy Garlic Festival. Ora dovevo andare a Belfast, nell'Irlanda del Nord. Avevo programmato di fare il tour della città e il giorno dopo un tour del ponte Carrick-a-Rede e della distilleria Bushmills. Poi, infine, ho preso il treno da Belfast Botanic a Portadown Central. Il 29 luglio 2004 sarei andato in treno a Dublino, nella Repubblica d'Irlanda. Il clima era molto più fresco che in Texas e sono stato abbastanza fortunato da rimanere in salute.\n\nBonjour à tous, Bienvenue au troisième jour de ma visite en Europe cet été 2004. Jusqu'au lundi 26 juillet 2004, j'étais chez mes parents en Californie, où j'étais à l'époque. J'étais là pour le festival de l'ail de Gilroy. Je devais maintenant me rendre à Belfast, en Irlande du Nord. J'avais prévu de faire le tour de la ville, puis le lendemain, de visiter le pont de Carrick-a-Rede et la distillerie Bushmills. Enfin, j'ai pris le train de Belfast Botanic à Portadown Central. Le 29 juillet 2004, j'allais prendre le train pour Dublin, en République d'Irlande. Le temps était bien plus frais qu'au Texas et j'ai eu la chance de rester en bonne santé.\n\nHallo zusammen, Willkommen zu Tag 3 meiner Europareise im Sommer 2004. Bis Montag, den 26. Juli 2004, hatte ich im damaligen Haus meiner Eltern in Kalifornien gewohnt. Ich war dort zum Gilroy Garlic Festival. Nun musste ich weiter nach Belfast in Nordirland. Ich hatte vor, an einer Stadtrundfahrt teilzunehmen und am nächsten Tag die Carrick-a-Rede-Brücke sowie die Bushmills-Brennerei zu besichtigen. Anschließend fuhr ich mit dem Zug vom Belfast Botanic nach Portadown Central. Am 29. Juli 2004 wollte ich mit dem Zug nach Dublin in der Republik Irland fahren. Das Wetter war viel kühler als in Texas und ich hatte das Glück, gesund zu bleiben.\n\nFirst I would like to apologize in advance, if some of the subject matter might cause distress. Part of today's adventure will contain the remnants of a conflict that started in the late 1960s, and lives were lost as a result. I will try very hard to keep that to a minimum, and focus on the more positive aspects of the events of the days concerned.\n\nMonday the 26th July 2004, I had planned to fly to Belfast, Northern Ireland, making connections at Chicago O'Hare and London Heathrow. I would fly in first class from San Francisco to Chicago O'Hare, and Premium Economy the rest of the way. At the time, I had a United Premier Silver status, and consequently could spend time in the dedicated lounges. I woke up about 5:30 AM, took a shower, packed up, had a small breakfast, before my mother drove me to SFO. I checked in my rolling suitcase, and took my backpack along with me. The United lounge, at the time, in Terminal 3, allowed me in for an hour. I caught the 9 AM flight to Chicago O'Hare. I think I arrived about 3 PM Central. The flight to London Heathrow would not leave until maybe 5:30 PM. If you like Gerschwin's \"Rhapsody In Blue\" song, there was at the time, an underground passageway between Terminals B and C, and on the loudspeakers was a handbell version of \"Rhapsody in Blue\". There was also a neon light display just above the travellators, turning on and off along to the music. The walls had windows the same colors as the neon lights.\n\nI was on a United flight to Heathrow from Chicago O'Hare in a sort of \"premium economy\" seat. It is different from the regular economy seats, since it has a few extra inches of legroom. On Monday 27th July 2004, I landed about 7:30 AM. First I went to the passport control, where I received a non-Schengen stamp in my passport. It said \"Leave to enter for 6 months, employment and access to public funds prohibited\". I would not need to have my passport stamped if I entered the Republic of Ireland by rail. My wheeled bag would be returned to me only after I had landed in Belfast. I was hungry, so I went to someplace in Terminal 3, the Cafe Rouge, that had a cafe serving \"Full English Breakfast\". I ordered it with coffee. I believe I had two fried eggs, sausage, tomatoes, a large mushroom and toast. Breakfast was very good, and cost only 9.50 pounds, including coffee.\n\nAfter breakfast, I walked around Heathrow, even walking to the Underground station to see what had changed since my last visit in March 2000. Pretty much everything was the same from that time. I went back to the terminal, where I would catch the plane to Belfast. British Midland Airlines, known by its code \"BMI\", had a partnership with United Airlines, and welcomed those with a United Premier Plus status into their lounge at no charge. I spent an hour there, before my flight to Belfast. I listened to the BBC on my radio, and had a glass of Boddington's in a \"nonic\" glass.\n\nAbout 10 AM, I boarded the flight to Belfast. It was on an Airbus A320, and it needed a jetway at Heathrow. The safety video had been prerecorded, and I would watch it again at least two more times on 31st July. The flight went over Isle of Man, before landing in Belfast City, east-northeast of downtown. The airport has since been renamed to the George Best Belfast City Airport. The international airport is west-northwest of downtown Belfast, close to Lough Neagh, and unlike the City Airport, it does not have a railway connection. Belfast City, if I remember correctly, did not have proper jetways, everyone had to alight by staircar. In later years, there might have been a couple installed.\n\nAt Belfast City Airport, I fetched my rolling suitcase. The rail link between Belfast City Airport and Downtown Belfast exists, but it is not particularly straightforward. You have to take a shuttle at the airport to the Sydenham Footbridge along the A2, go up and down the stairs, and go to the far side platform, not the near one, as trains would go to Bangor. There were no ticket machines, fares would be sold by the conductor. One thing I noticed at the corner of Inverary Drive and Station Road, was a house with a mural. In Sydenham, which I would learn later that day, the east part of Belfast tends to be loyalist, while the west part tends to be republican (unity with the Republic of Ireland). The mural was on behalf of the Ulster Volunteer Force. It has changed over time, probably three or four times, since I had last been to Sydenham. A train came in the direction of Bangor, likely a class 80. Arriving and departing sounded something like a helicopter landing and taking off. Since Northern Ireland's railways were not electrified then, they were served by diesel multiple unit trains, 80 class with the door handles on the outside, and 450 class that has electric door opening. Unlike in the UK, the Northern Ireland railways use the same gauge as in the Republic, namely 1,600 mm, known as \"Irish Gauge\". I rode a 450 class EMU from Sydenham to the terminus at Belfast Central, recently renamed to Belfast Lanyon Place, past the Titanic Quarter. I changed to an 80 class train, and rode for one stop to Botanic. The youth hostel was not very far. I think I arrived there about 10 AM. I checked in and signed up for the city tour for that day and the countryside tour for the next day. The countryside tour would include a lunch break where the city tour would not. The youth hostel was in the loyalist part of Belfast, the curbstones were painted red white and blue, and you could see hundreds of Union Jack flags strung along Donegall Road and Sandy Row. The \"Orange Parade\" had taken place two weeks prior.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the city tour bus arrived, and only a few minutes later, it would end up at Belfast City Hall so that more passengers could board. We went first to the Gaeltacht Quarter on Falls Road. We spent maybe five minutes at Leeson Street, before going on to Shankill and the former Crumlin Road Gaol. The bus had stopped close to the Oliver Cromwell murals, at the time there were two. We were told by the tour guide, not to walk on the grass area due to \"booby traps\", basically meaning that many dogs do their business in random locations. Please bear in mind, it is difficult to exactly retrace the tour route, as over time, murals are covered and repainted, sometimes just simply covered with a solid color, or even the building can be demolished.\n\nThe bus left and we went on to see the Victoria Square and Belfast Cathedral. Belfast Cathedral is Episcopalian, more or less. It had opened in 1904. It is unique as it has two bishop's seats. It had a very nice interior, with corinthian columns and stained glass windows. They did not use benches, but they had individual wooden seats. They requested a visitor donation of about 2 pounds. They used the term \"unwaged\", for the local unemployed, which would have been maybe 1.00 pound.\n\nThe bus also passed by the Titanic construction grounds, and went as far east as Stormont, the location of the Local Assembly of Northern Ireland. The builidng itself was post-Georgian, had six ionian columns, and steps to the entryway. The lamp posts had moose heads on them. We did not have time to spend there unfortunately. The bus went past Queens's Square and the Albert Memorial Clock The tour ended at the City Hall square, and I was free to wander about. I must have wandered about for the last three hours, about as far east as the Albert Memorial Clock, but don't remember much else, as I felt jetlag and went to my bedroom to sleep. I used my UK adapter to charge my phone, which was a Siemens S40. The adapter I used was a \"Type G\", which worked fine. I went to sleep and woke up about 5:30 AM on Tuesday 28 July.\n\nFor some reason at 5:30 AM, I woke up, took a shower and then walked from the hostel to Belfast Central station. I took the first train somehow to Whiteabbey, wanting actually to go to Bangor, but by then it was too late. I was in a class 80 train. I happened to see an Iarnrod Eireann train, which I would take the next day to Dublin. The train also passed by Yorkgate. I remembered when I arrived at Whiteabbey, to put the window down and turn the handle to open the door. I did not spend much time at Whiteabbey. The only building of interest nearby was the hospital. I took another train back to Central Station and a bus to somewhere on Dublin Road. It was somewhere close to Wetherspoon Free House. I had a breakfast buffet for about 12 pounds. I could just pick the items that I wanted to eat. Then I took a bus back to the hostel, in time to catch the country tour bus.\n\nThe bus left the hostel about 10 AM. It went on the M2 to Glengormley, then north on the A8 to Carnlough Marina where we made our first stop. I remember the Herbert Street Bridge which had the maximum headroom sign of 13 feet and 3.8 meters. The bus went onwards to Carrick A Rede rope bridge. It was a pedestrian only bridge, and there was a charge of 1.00 pound to go over, returning was no charge. I had to walk from the car park on a trail to the bridge. I paid my one pound, and received a receipt for it. Once I returned, I received a signed certificate that I crossed the bridge. Crossing the bridge was not as scary as I had feared. It was going from a cliff to an island. I spent a few minutes there before going back.\n\nThe bus went on to the Giant's Causeway. It is said that the causeway goes as far as Fingal's Cave on the Scottish island of Staffa, past Islay. We stayed there for about ten minutes before going to lunch. We had lunch at a pub, and I think I had a thick cut bacon sandwich, salad and glass of local cider, something similar to Magner's. After lunch, we stopped at the Bushmill's distillery. They specialized in whiskey. I was picked to do a taste test at the end of the tour, I think I might have had seven shots of various Irish whiskeys, including Jameson, John Bower & Son, Black Bush and even Bushmills. After the tour ended, the bus drove down the A26 and M22 back to the hostel in Belfast. The tour arrived about 5 PM at the hostel.\n\nI was not quite content to end the day just yet. I walked to Botanic, had a snack of chicken strips, fries and fizzy lemonade. Then I took a train to Portadown, just to look around. The train I rode over was a 80 class train. It made an intermediate stop at the former Great Victoria station, which has since been decomissioned. I walked from the station to High Street. At some point, there were gates that were due to close about 8 PM. Looking at recent Google photos of the same place, those gates would have been removed. I found some place to have fish and chips. About 9 PM, I took the train back to Botanic station. The train arrived at Botanic about 10:30 PM. When the train was at Finaghy, the lights had turned on. As it was a low pressure sodium light, otherwise a SOX light, it had a pinkish glow which would turn bright yellow. Ireland is in the GMT +1 zone, GMT +0 during winter, and the sun might rise and set later than in the UK. I went to my bed in the hostel and went to sleep. I would have to wake up fairly early to catch the bus to the rail station to go to Dublin.\n\nI hope you will join me in tomorrow's adventure in the Republic of Ireland. I get to go on the self guided tour including a LUAS ride to Sandyford. You will kind of feel what it would be like to be in the film \"The Commitments\", particularly with Robert Arkins. See you then!\n\nSummer 2004 in California - Days 0 to 3 - Gilroy Garlic Festival\n\nHi everyone, Between 22nd July and 10th August 2024, I went on vacation to parts of Europe that I had never yet visited, and to some parts that I had known a while. First I had to visit my family back in California in time to celebrate the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Then I flew to Chicago, London Heathrow, and Belfast City Airport. I took a train to Dublin, flew to London Heathrow and subsequently Milan's Linate airport, took the train to Lugano, Zug via Lucerne, Geneva, Zurich, and Munich via Schaffhausen and Stuttgart. It was almost three weeks long, and very enjoyable. I hope you will join me in the days that I visit each part.\n\nDia daoibh, Idir an 22 Iúil agus an 10 Lúnasa 2024, chuaigh mé ar saoire go dtí codanna den Eoraip nár thug mé cuairt orthu go fóill, agus chuig áiteanna áirithe a raibh aithne agam orthu le tamall anuas. Ar dtús bhí orm cuairt a thabhairt ar mo theaghlach ar ais i California in am chun Féile Gairleoige Gilroy a cheiliúradh. Ansin d’eitil mé go Chicago, Londain Heathrow, agus Aerfort Chathair Bhéal Feirste. Thóg mé traein go Baile Átha Cliath, d’eitil mé go Londain Heathrow agus ina dhiaidh sin aerfort Linate i Milano, thóg mé an traein go Lugano, Zug via Lucerne, an Ghinéiv, Zurich, agus München trí Schaffhausen agus Stuttgart. Bhí sé beagnach trí seachtaine ar fad, agus an-taitneamhach. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tú in éineacht liom sna laethanta a dtugaim cuairt ar gach cuid.\n\nCiao a tutti, Tra il 22 luglio e il 10 agosto 2024 sono andato in vacanza in alcune parti d'Europa che non avevo mai visitato e in alcune parti che conoscevo da un po'. Prima ho dovuto visitare la mia famiglia in California in tempo per celebrare il Gilroy Garlic Festival. Poi sono volato a Chicago, Londra Heathrow e Belfast City Airport. Ho preso un treno per Dublino, sono volato a Londra Heathrow e successivamente all'aeroporto di Milano Linate, ho preso il treno per Lugano, Zugo via Lucerna, Ginevra, Zurigo e Monaco via Sciaffusa e Stoccarda. Sono state quasi tre settimane, e molto piacevoli. Spero che vi unirete a me nei giorni in cui visiterò ogni parte.\n\nBonjour à tous, Entre le 22 juillet et le 10 août 2024, je suis partie en vacances dans des régions d'Europe que je n'avais jamais visitées et dans certaines que je connaissais depuis longtemps. J'ai d'abord dû rendre visite à ma famille en Californie à temps pour célébrer le Gilroy Garlic Festival. Ensuite, j'ai pris l'avion pour Chicago, Londres Heathrow et l'aéroport de Belfast City. J'ai pris un train pour Dublin, j'ai pris l'avion pour Londres Heathrow puis l'aéroport de Milan Linate, j'ai pris le train pour Lugano, Zoug via Lucerne, Genève, Zurich et Munich via Schaffhouse et Stuttgart. Cela a duré près de trois semaines et c'était très agréable. J'espère que vous me rejoindrez les jours où je visiterai chaque partie.\n\nHallo zusammen, Zwischen dem 22. Juli und dem 10. August 2024 machte ich Urlaub in Teilen Europas, die ich noch nie besucht hatte, und in einigen Teilen, die ich schon länger kannte. Zuerst musste ich meine Familie in Kalifornien besuchen, rechtzeitig, um das Gilroy Garlic Festival zu feiern. Dann flog ich nach Chicago, London Heathrow und zum Belfast City Airport. Ich nahm einen Zug nach Dublin, flog nach London Heathrow und anschließend zum Mailänder Flughafen Linate, nahm den Zug nach Lugano, Zug über Luzern, Genf, Zürich und München über Schaffhausen und Stuttgart. Es dauerte fast drei Wochen und war sehr angenehm. Ich hoffe, Sie begleiten mich an den Tagen, an denen ich jeden Teil besuche.\n\nWednesday 21st July 2004, I had left work, and went home to pack up and get some sleep, so that I could take my flight from DFW airport to San Francisco, California. I had planned to visit my parents for a few days. About 6:30 AM on Thursday 22nd July 2004, I rode the Super Shuttle shared ride from my apartment in Frisco, Texas, to DFW airport, at the time, in Terminal B on the Tarrant County side of the line. DFW Airport is shared by two counties, terminals A, C and E on the Dallas County side, and Terminals B and D on the Tarrant County side. In 2004, no one would ever think, that there would be, by 2019, any kind of rail service between that airport and Dallas or Fort Worth. But eventually two transit systems came together to build rail links. Until then, my only way to get to DFW airport, was shared ride, or after September 2008, by DART and the Trinity Rail Express with a shuttle to the southern remote parking lot, just south of the rental car terminal.\n\nI flew from DFW to San Francisco, in the first class section. I had some United Airlines miles that I used to secure my spot in first class. I also had my flight to Chicago O'Hare booked with such miles. There was a two hour time difference, so I think I arrived in the afternoon at SFO. My mother was able to pick me up in her pickup, a 2001 Dodge Dakota extra cab. We went home, and I was not sure what we did that day, other than order food out.\n\nFriday the 23rd July 2004, the Gilroy Garlic Festival was about to start. It was also the last day, that I remember recording The Dog House on FM radio, Wild 94.9 FM KYLD. I managed to record about an hour. I had missed them for about five months or so, after moving to Texas. I remember than on Saturday 24th July 2004, I definitely went with my mother to Gilroy for the garlic festival. I had been there at least once before, namely late July 2002. It was held close to the Bonfante Gardens location. At the festival, we saw many displays of uses of garlic. I really enjoyed the steak with basil pesto spaghetti. The garlic ice cream was good, tasted more vanilla than garlic. It was a good time there, the weather was a bit better than that in Dallas, which would have been more humid and hotter.\n\nI don't remember much of Sunday 25th July. However I do remember leaving California for the next few months, that I will write about in the next story. Hope you will join me then.\n\nDay 12 - 12 November 2003 - Hong Kong Repulse Bay, Stanley, Aberdeen, Tseung Kwan O, Kowloon, and Tung Chung\n\nWednesday 12 November 2003\n\nOn Wednesday 12th November 2003, I decided not to have breakfast at the hotel. I wanted to try something local, but the menus were in Chinese and I could not find anywhere suitable, other than either McDonalds or 7-Eleven. I settled on McDonald's, and the breakfast was not much different than in the USA. Also I added more value to the Octopus card at 7-Eleven, I think around US$ 30.00, plenty of money for a full day's fares on the bus.\n\nAfter breakfast, I walked to Des Voeux Road to take the trolley to the Sheung Wan MTR subway station to go one stop to Central. At Central there is a bus terminal for the city busses. I had to wait fifteen minutes for a direct bus to Repulse Bay which cost about $0.75 with the Octopus card. The bus went along Des Voeux Road past Admiralty subway station, on to Queensway, Stubbs Road where it became Wong Nai Chung Gap Road and Repulse Bay Road. Coming down the hill to Repulse Bay beach, the bus passed by the Hong Kong Tennis Centre.\n\nAt the Repulse Bay beach, the main attraction is 109 Repulse Bay Road, where there is a building that has a large gap, eliminating six floors for part of the building. After that, there is a stairway to the beach, where hardly anyone was there. I stayed there for about five minutes. I think the beach was two square miles. There was a large digital clock that would sometimes show the temperature, and at the time, it showed 22 C which is about 71 F. Too cold for any serious swimming.\n\nI took another bus to the Stanley Market. Stanley Market is a single-level mall, with probably two hundred independent vendors, selling clothes, electronics, jewelry, and so much more. If you look on Google Maps, and look up Stanley Market, you can use the Street View mode, to look inside the market (faces are blocked). I bought a silk handkerchief with a chain-link pattern. Most of the staff spoke English well enough. After Stanley Market, I went to the Wellcome [sic] grocery store at 88 Stanley Village Road to buy some lunch items. I remember buying a jar of vegemite, that yeasty and salty spread. And a box of bag tea. One thing that caught my eye, the Hong Kong authorities made a poster against SARS, with a warning in traditional Chinese and English, to people not to spit in public, but rather expectorate into some tissue, or face a HK$ 5,000 fine, approx US $ 600.00. SARS is no joke.\n\nI found a bus line that went directly from Stanley Market to Aberdeen, passing by the Repulse Bay tower that had the gap. The ride took about twenty minutes and cost maybe $ 1.50 on the Octopus card. The bus went past Sham Wan. Aberdeen has many high-rise apartments, is more built up than Stanley Village. I walked along the Aberdeen Promenade, and when walking back to the bus stop for Kennedy Town, I saw a bird in a cage but no human was around to attend to it. Since my visit in 2003, there was a subway line opened in 2016 called the South Island line, that connects Admiralty to Aberdeen via Wong Chuk Hang and Ocean Park.\n\nAfter Aberdeen, I took a bus to Ngau Tao Kok northeast of Kowloon, I think the bus fare was $ 2.50 including the fee for using an underground tunnel. Then I would start my subway adventure as far as Tseung Kwan O at Junk Bay. I boarded the Kwun Tong Line at Ngau Tao Kok for Tiu Keng Leng and further along to Tseung Kwan O with its eponymous line. At Tseung Kwan O I explored around for a few minutes, it was about as built up as Aberdeen but did not have any farther MRT extension to Po Lam or LOHAS park until about 2009. At Tseung Kwan O, I called back to the USA on a payphone. I had to ask for change as the phones accepted only HK$1 coins and I was out at the time. I took then the Tseung Kwan O line to North Point to connect to the Island Line for Central/Hong Kong. I wanted then to go to Tung Chung on Lantau Island. MTR stations on the Island Line at the time, did not have protective doors. Also on some of the Tsuen Wan line stations between Sham Shui Po to Lai King, there were also no such doors. Some stations however did, but only those that were underground.\n\nAlthough Central and Hong Kong were physically in the same location on Hong Kong Island, they were classified as two separate subway stations, mainly for the distance that one has to walk between the two. There are two entry points for Hong Kong station, one for the Tung Chung line, and one for the Airport Express line that does not stop except at Tsing Yi. My Octopus card did not include the ride for the airport except a one-way ride, and I did not want to use it that day. My only other option was to use the slightly slower Tung Chung line. The train did not stop at the time, at Sunny Bay or Nam Cheong. It stopped at Kowloon, Olympic, Lai King, Tsing Yi and Tung Chung. Between Tsing Yi and Tung Chung, the train went very fast, right next to the Airport Express tracks. I exited the train at Tung Chung, and was hungry. I found some sandwich store at Skyline Gateway. After eating, I went to the Citygate outlets to buy more bag tea. The Wellcome store that I visited, had a \"wet market\" in the basement, where you could buy fresh fish and seafood. I was tempted to buy some but didn't. I bought a few magazines in traditional Chinese and I have some of them still today. After shopping, I took the Tung Chung subway line to Tsing Yi, where I wanted to try to take the Airport Express back to Hong Kong station but there was only an exit for Hong Kong and entry to the airport but no entry to the Hong Kong station. I strolled the mall for a half hour before taking the Tung Chung line to Lai King, and I took the Tsuen Wan line to Mong Kok, right in the middle of Kowloon. Kowloon, particularly along Nathan Road, is where the most lighted signs can be seen. I think the time was 7 PM and the sun had set. Nathan Road was very busy with people.\n\nAfter Kowloon, I wanted to see how close to Sheung Shui I could get. You can't go to Lo Wu without a visa for the PRC, so Sheung Shui is the closest. I took the Kwun Tong line from Mong Kok to Kowloon Tong to board the East Rail line. In 2003, the East Rail line was not part of the MTR subway and thus the fare was not included and had to be deducted from the Octopus card. If you travel in first class, the fare is about US $10. On the East Rail line, I decided not to go any farther than the University station. It was about five stations prior to arriving at the PRC border. I spent about fifteen minutes around the University station before taking the East Rail line back to Hong Kong Island with the Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and Island lines.\n\nAfter the Island line train reached Sheung Wan, that was the last of the subway rides. I took the trolley along Des Voeux road to Hill Road and bought some curry buns and Sprite and ate them at the hotel. I had to pack up for the next leg of the journey. It was short and I wished I could stay longer.\n\nDay 3 - 11 November 2003 - ferry to Macau and bus to Coloane to see into China's Guangdong\n\nTuesday 11 November 2003\n\n早上好 (Zhou sen)! おはようございます/ Ohayogozaimasu! Bom dia! Good morning!\n\nIt is the second (or third day if you count crossing the international date line from 9th to 10th November 2003, making 10th November 2003 possibly the shortest day of my life that I remember as an adult).\n\nOn the 11th November 2003, I went somewhere where I had no prior intention of going, prior to my arrival in Hong Kong the previous evening. That same morning I took a hydrofoil ferry to the Macau S.A.R. Access from the Novotel (today's Hotel Jen) was possible either by trolley which was accessible at Des Voeux Road, or with the hotel's shuttle bus, to the Hong Kong Macau Ferry terminal at the Sheung Wan subway station. The HKU subway station that is now close to the hotel, was not built in 2003.\n\nThe morning of the 11th, I wanted to get a good view of Hong Kong and Kowloon. This was possible by going to the pool level, I think 25th or 26th floor. It seemed a bit chilly to go swimming, as it was about 55 F / 12 C, and also it was cloudy. I did not stay more than fifteen minutes. But the view was very interesting, I could see as far as Tsing Yi and maybe Nathan Road in Kowloon.\n\nIt was not yet time for the hotel to serve breakfast. I walked along Queen's Road, and the morning commute was already underway. The local McDonalds and 7 Eleven were busy at the time. I bought a few provisions for the day, a bottle of lucozade and Sprite and curry buns that I enjoyed the night before.\n\nAbout 7:30 AM breakfast was ready. I was one of maybe three or four people in the entire breakfast room. Breakfast was a buffet of cheeses, bread, cold cuts, hard boiled eggs, and even freshly baked curry buns, that the server highly recommended. It was very delicious, and a good deal for a surcharge of US $ 9.00.\n\nAfter breakfast, I let the front desk know that I wanted to go to the Hong Kong-Macau ferry terminal, so they put my name down for a space. The shuttle was a Toyota Coaster 15-seater with manual transmission. The ride was about ten minutes along Des Voeux Road to Sheung Wan. Once I entered the ferry terminal, I bought my ticket for about US $ 15.00 round trip. I was assigned a second-class seat for the outbound trip and had a first-class seat for the inbound trip later that evening. Before boarding the ferry, I had to get an exit stamp in my passport, and when I boarded, I had to get to my seat and buckle up. Hydrofoil boats can travel fast and is susceptible to winds along the Zhujiang River Estuary. The ferry boat announcements were in Mandarin, Cantonese, English and Portuguese.\n\nWhen the ferry left Hong Kong, it went nonstop on the south side of Lantau Island where the Chek Lap Kok airport is located. For those who never visited Hong Kong or Macau, it is difficult to tell the land mass, where Macau begins or the PRC begins. Back then (year 2003), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge did not exist and it was not even an idea until years later.\n\nThe ferry arrived about 11 AM at the Terminal Marítimo do Porto Exterior de Macau, or the external ferry port. This would be the entry and exit point for my travels that day. I had to get an entry stamp into Macau. For US citizens, no entry visa for the PRC was necessary, so all I received was a 30-day leave to enter stamp in Chinese and Portuguese.\n\nThe ferry terminal is located in the St. Lazarus Parish, and is also in some ways like \"The Strip\" that you might remember from Las Vegas, as gambling is legal in Macau but not Hong Kong. I walked along Avenida da Amizade and noticed that there were chain-kinked fences around some of the streets. This was because the 2003 Macau Grand Prix was about to happen in a few day's time.\n\nTrying to change Hong Kong dollars to Macau patacas is a waste of time, and the money changers will simply refuse to change HK dollars for the pataca. Macau accepts Hong Kong Dollar notes at par, not necessarily the coins. There is a slight advantage for the US dollar, you may receive 3% more in Macau than Hong Kong. Coins between Hong Kong and Macau have different shapes, some have odd shapes, and with the Hong Kong $10 coin, there is a single longitudal groove.\n\nI was getting hungry about 11:45 AM, so I tried to find a bus to Coloane, namely Fernando's, located at Hac Sa, but I ended up instead at Parque Eanes on the opposite side of Coloane, and eating at Restaurante Espaco Lisboa - which I think was a better deal. The bus traversed first through Macau, past the Hotel Wynn Macau, then on the Ponte da Amizade (Friendship bridge) past the airport on Taipa. The bus went further south on Taipa along Estrada do Istmo, past Estrada Flor de Lótus. Along the way there were many white statues of the Chinese zodiac, including the tiger, monkey, rabbit, pig, rat, and horse. There was a bridge to Zhuhai in Taipa, which on the Macau side was left-hand running, until Zhuhai when it switched to right-hand running.\n\nOnce the bus started after Estrada Flor de Lótus, the bus drove onto Estrada de Seac Pai Van and then Rua de Entre-Campos, and it was in the Coloane district, the furthest south in the Macau S.A.R. The bus stopped at the southeast side of Parque Eanes, corner of Estrade de Cheoc Van. The bus driver said in English \"Last stop\". I tried to find the bus line to Hac Sa, but I changed my mind when I saw the sign for Restaurant Espaco - Lisboa, and thought maybe this might be a better experience. I could not find the alley way, and not knowing I needed to go along Rua das Gaivotas, in 2003 there were no smartphones and consequently no Google-Maps available, so I used my in 2001 purchased cellphone to call the restaurant, a ++853 number. The owner answered and was helpful. She was very nice enough to come to Parque Eanes and show me the way to the restaurant. I had a table facing Zhuhai. I was served a bottle of Sintra beer. I think at the time, it was already 1 PM Beijing/HK time. I ordered a steak with fried egg and two strips of bacon. I think also it was served with potatoes. I had my radio with me, I was listening to Radio Macao 98.0 FM, the Portuguese-language station. Three songs I distinctly remember being played between 12:55 PM and 1:15 PM that day, \"Pandajero\" by Cantoma, \"Two Fingers\" by J J Johanssen and \"Island\" by Heather Nova, including a top-of-the-hour-em-português news report. Eventually I needed to use the bathroom. The bathroom was not the Chinese kind I had expected, it was a proper European bathroom with sit-down toilet, and the electric outlet was the same as in Hong Kong and the UK, namely the \"G\" type rectangular pins, bottom two flat and middle one vertical. After lunch, I let the owner know that I enjoyed having lunch there. About 1:40 PM or so, I walked down Rua das Gaivotas and Rua do Tassara, then south on Avenida de Cinco de Outubro, so that I could get a good view of Zhuhai, and that would be pretty much all of the PRC that I would be able to see at the time.\n\nAlong my walk, I passed by the Escola Primária Luso-Chinesa de Coloane and turned back to Parque Eanes at the Tam Kong Buddhist temple and along Rua do Estaleiro. The Chinese and Portuguese cultures seemed to jump out at that particular section. For example, there was a painting of a panda eating bamboo, and a block away, was a portuguese Quinta house painted in pink. I walked the rest of the way to Parque Eanes by Rua do Meio. The fare back to Macau was a little more than from Macau, I think somewhere around $ 0.90.\n\nI am not exactly sure anymore where the bus from Coloane to Macau took me, but I think I exited around the Jardim de Sao Francisco, in the Cathedral Parish. I remember a distinct building, painted in pink and white, called the Clube Militar. I took photos of its northwest side along the Avenida da Praia Grande. While walking towards the Ruins of St. Paul's, I saw a display for the Macau Grand Prix, and a 1970's performance edition of the Ford Escort. It is a 3/4 mile walk from Clube Militar to the Ruins, so you would walk along Avenida da Praia Grande, Calcada de Sao Joao, pass by St. Dominic's church, Rua da Palha and on the hill, are the ruins. There exists only the facade of the cathedral, maybe two feet thick at most. When you walk through those streets I have named, those are basically pedestrian alleys and most of the old colonial Portuguese buildings remain. Behind the ruins, is a Buddhist temple, and anyone can enter the grounds on condition that they keep a quiet and calm demeanor.\n\nAfter seeing the ruins, I think it was 4:30 PM or so. I took a bus to Portas de Cerco, which is physically the closest I have ever been in my life to the PRC. There is not much to see, and the wall that separates the PRC from Macau is so high, that it kind of gives a feeling of being in Cold-War era West Berlin. 5 PM came around and it was time to do some shopping. I walked along Istmo de Ferreira do Amaral, and found some place to buy crispy egg roll cookies. They were half an inch in diameter, about six inches long, and for about 30 of them, in a tin box. I was thirsty and went to a grocery store located along Avenida de Artur Namagnini Barbosa. I bought a few cans of lemon soda.\n\nIt was getting around 6 PM and the sun went down. I had to get back to Hong Kong. I took the bus back to the ferry terminal. Buying postcards was a challenge. No one spoke either enough English or Portuguese, so I had to resort to hand gestures. Eventually I was able to buy postcards and Macau postage. Leaving Macau, I had a \"saida\" exit stamp in my passport. The ferry ride back was a little choppy as it was high tide. I was buckled well into my seat. I was served a light snack as I was in first class going back to Hong Kong.\n\nWhen I arrived in Hong Kong, I had to declare that I did not have SARS, stand for a few seconds under a temperature sensor, and then had my passport stamped. Due to the proximity of the Hong Kong Macau Ferry terminal to the Sheung Wan subway station, I thought it would be a good opportunity to ride the subway for a little bit. My Octopus card was valid for the journey, unlimited rides up to the 13th. I did not go very far, maybe just to Lai King in the northwest of Kowloon. I would ride more of the subway on Wednesday the 12th. After exiting at Sheung Wan, I took the trolley to Hill Street and walked to the hotel on Queen's Road. The ride cost around US $ 0.30, actually HK$ 2.00. You enter at the back, and at your stop you exit at the front paying the 2 HK dollars. The trolleys are generally slow, going about 20 mph / 30 km/h.\n\nI ate a curry bun and drank Sprite, and then went to bed. I had to make the most of the next day before flying home.\n\nNext chapter, the great Far-East subway adventure, dragon-hole building sighting, buying tea at the Tung Chung Wellcome store and even a train trip towards Sheung Wan, lastly with an evening in Kowloon Nathan Road.\n\nXie xie, domo arrigato, obrigado and thank you!\n\nMusic seen years later on a tape I recorded while in Macau\n\n- \"Sounds of the samba\" by Victor Davies\n\n- \"Happy Here\" by Danmass\n\n- \"Pandajero\" by Cantoma\n\nAfter the news came\n\n- \"Two fingers\" by J J Johannsson\n\n- \"I am an island\" by Heather Nova\n\nand I ran out of tape and had to replace it with a fresh one.\n\nNice memories of Macau from so long ago.\n\nDay 1 - 9 November 2003 - Flight to Hong Kong from SFO terminal \"A\"\n\nSunday 9 November 2003\n\nKonnichiwa, Ni Hao and Ola!\n\nToday marks fifteen years since my visit to East Asia, particularly the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions of China, plus a partial day at Tokyo Narita airport. Actually I would not stop at Narita until Thursday 13th November 2003. This would be the first time in my adult life, and so far it is the only time, that I would cross the international date line. You may have heard in the news about the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge that was opened recently. When I visited in November 2003, this was not even an idea (at least to most US citizens) that this could be built. Without crossing into the PRC, the only way to go between Hong Kong and Macau, was by boat.\n\nI would like to break up my visit into four parts as there is so much to tell.\n\n- 9th to 10th SFO to HKG nonstop, coach from Chek Lap Kok airport to hotel via Kowloon, 7 Eleven at Queen's Road West near Hill Road (Shek Tong Tsui district).\n\n- 11th Breakfast at hotel, Hong Kong to Macau ferry, lunch on Coloane, St Paul cathedral, and ferry back to Hong Kong, with a journey on the MTR subway and tramway back to the hotel.\n\n- 12th Breakfast at McDonald's, bus to Central, Repulse Bay, Stanley Market and Aberdeen, MTR to Sheung Kwan O, Tung Chung and Kowloon\n\n- 13th Minibus to HKG airport, flight to Narita, afternoon and \"beef bowl udon\", flight to SFO, arrival the \"same day\"\n\nLet's start with why I went to Hong Kong and Macau and back via Narita. Instead of my usual journey to Europe as I did in August of that year, I was suggested to give Hong Kong a try, and not worry that I speak very little Mandarin or Cantonese. United Airlines at the time, had a special package of roundtrip airfare to Hong Kong, three day's accommodations and offers of touristic interest for a good price. I had to renew my passport from 1994 as it would expire in any case.\n\nSunday 9th November was my flight, nonstop from San Francisco Terminal A to Hong Kong. It was in a Boeing 747 and in the economy class when economy class at least had decent legroom. Before the flight, I wanted to try some \"congee\" with shrimp. Congee is a savory rice porridge, about the same consistency as an average bowl of Quaker Oats. A little soy sauce can give it a nice flavor.\n\nI think the flight departed around 1:10 PM Pacific. It would not arrive in Hong Kong until at least 8 PM the next day (Monday 10th November), so that makes the flight about 15 hours long, not quite as long as a flight from the US west coast to Auckland, New Zealand. On the plane, you cannot automatically perceive crossing the international date line. At the time, the 747 did not have individually controlled entertainment in economy class as a 777 would, it was all centralized, I have no idea about the situation in business or the still-existent first class. I remember watching four films in total, including \"Whale Rider\" from New Zealand, I remember distinctly that traditional Chinese subtitles were on-screen for that film. During the flight there was a snack and then supper. At some times, the flight attendants would serve Chinese tea, where you would not add sugar or anything else, just tea leaves and hot water.\n\nIt seemed like for the most part, the day went on \"forever\", until the plane approached Japanese airspace - and then the 9th turned into the 10th, kind of like it's 4:30 PM on the 9th, and then suddenly it's 4:31 PM on the 10th, that's what crossing the international date line westward sort of feels like. The sun was getting low, and the plane made a southwest turn, to just touch the eastern Chinese coastline for the next two hours. As the plane approached Hong Kong, the sun set and the sky was getting dimmer. The plane touched down about 7:30 PM. Everyone alighted the plane to be processed by Hong Kong SAR customs.\n\nIf you remember Autumn 2003, you might remember the SARS epidemic. SARS was defined as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\". The epicenter was Hong Kong, and Macau also was taking precautions to minize the effects. At passport control, you had to make a declaration that you had to state your health condition, namely stating any health symptoms if any, in addition, there were body temperature sensors, to make sure that travellers did not have a fever. The Hong Kong entry passport stamp allowed US Citizens a visa-free stay of 90 days, I think Macau it was down to 30 days. After passport control, I had to go to the baggage claim and meet the tour bus that was booked in addition to my hotel stay. While the tour bus had not yet arrived, I went to the MTR sales booth to buy a subway pass. It was called the \"Octopus Card\", and allowed three days of unlimited subway travel, plus a HK $200 stored value for bus and trolley rides. It even could be recharged at the local 7 Eleven stores for cash. I withdrew about US $ 100.00 to start, and I think the rate was around US 1= 8.20 HK. The Macau Pataca, I would find out, would be at par with the Hong Kong dollar, and local banks would be reluctant to exchange Hong Kong dollars for Patacas. More on that in the following chapter.\n\nThe bus came around 8:30 PM and the bus dispatcher had to tally up who was staying in Kowloon and who was staying in Hong Kong Island. The bus drove along Route 8 which passed through Tsing Yi, Disneyland Hong Kong, Tsing Yi and ended up in Kowloon. The bus dropped a few people off somewhere along Nathan Road or some side street closeby. Then the bus went under Kowloon Bay in tunnel to Queen's Road West, though the bus made a stop after leaving the tunnel. I did not arrive at my hotel until at least 9:30 PM. I was staying at the Novotel in the Sai Wan district, which currently now is the Hotel Jen. There was a McDonald's and a 7 Eleven store close by. For maybe $ 6 US, I bought a couple of curry buns (pulled chicken or pork) and a can of Sprite and a bottle of Lucozade. And I topped up my Octopus Card for bus fare if needed later.\n\nMy room was on the 22nd floor, and I think the outdoor pool was on the 25th floor. My room did not have the best view but it was okay. I had a room looking at the ramp of Hill Road, leading to Connaught Road. The room had a remote control to control the radio, TV, alarm clock, and many things imaginable. The bathroom was pretty much similar to those I knew in the US, Canada and Europe. Electricity was the same as in the UK, namely the \"G\" type plug. I found the next day that Macau also uses the \"G\" plug. I did not watch TV but I had my Aiwa HS JS 479 and could listen to and record the local stations, most of them were in Cantonese, there was also the BBC World Service in English.\n\nI think I went to bed about 11 PM after enjoying my curry bun and Sprite. The bed was firmer than most that I remembered, was not too bad. Somehow or other, I thought, if the hotel has a free shuttle to the Hong Kong-Macau ferry terminal, why not go? I did not plan to visit Macau but thought, as long as I am in that part of the world, there was no better time to go. Looking back 15 years on, I am glad I did.\n\nSo that was all for the 9th and the 10th November 2003. Next chapter, ferry ride to Macau, and views of its Portuguese past.\n\nThank you and good night!\n\n謝謝，晚安！! (Xièxiè, wan'an!)\n\nObrigado e boa noite!\n\nありがとう、おやすみなさい! (Arigato, oyasuminasai!)\n\nDays 2 to 4 - The Chico Halloween 2003 and drive up to Medford, Oregon with Grants Pass and Ashland\n\nHi everyone\n\nI wanted to let you know about fifteen years ago today, when it was the last time I visited Chico, CA and Oregon. It was the weekend of 31st October to 2nd November 2003. During that time I visited\n\n- Chico\n\n- Orland\n\n- Redding\n\n- drive on I-5 past Mt. Shasta\n\n- Hilt CA and Oregon state line\n\n- descent into Ashland and Medford\n\n- drive to Grants Pass before returning and having supper\n\n- fuelling up at Medford Safeway\n\n- long drive back to Foster City CA via Willows, lunch at Black Bear diner\n\n- arrive home in Foster City by 9:30 PM\n\nOn 31st October 2003 I arrived at Chico about 7 PM at the Super 8 motel, after having left work about 3 PM by prior permission - it was a 4 hour journey from Redwood City via San Mateo-Hayward bridge and I-880 to I-80 then I-505 and on to I-5 to Orland, and then on local roads thereafter. The Super 8 is near Cohasset and CA-99, and at the time it was next door to a Denny's that I remember previously eating at on Sunday 7th January 2001. I dropped off the luggage and found a place to park in the downtown 4th Street parking structure before traffic got worse. I went to a couple of places I remember from my university days, particularly Duffy's, watch some live concert, but I don't know if I went into the Madison Bear Garden, there is always a line outside on Halloween night. Since my university days at CSU Chico, nothing much seemed to have changed. After eating a \"Sleepy Dan Special\" meal at Jack's Diner, I went back to the hotel.\n\nI think I woke up the next morning about 7:30 AM. Super 8 was serving breakfast. Some guests had slept in their costumes when they came down to the breakfast room. I had to check out by 8:30 AM so I could get a good start to driving to Medford. Why Medford? I had been wanting to go to Medford for probably since 1998, just to have a leisurely tour around it, and also Ashland. Leaving Chico, I drove north and west on CA-32 to Orland, so I could get a good photo of the big catfish. I have no idea how long the catfish has been standing or why it was even placed there. After Orland I went north on I-5. I-5 is not particularly hilly between Arbuckle and Red Bluff, and then from Anderson to just north of Redding it is fairly flat. Somewhere around Mountain Gate up to Weed, I-5 has many curves and speed limits are down to 55 mph or 90 km/h. The scenery is interesting, especially if you get close enough to see Mt. Shasta.\n\nHilt is the last town in California on I-5, before the Oregon state line. From Yreka to Hilt, I-5 has a gradual incline, and after crossing into Oregon, there is a gradual decline towards Ashland. Downtown Ashland has a Shakespeare program, and I would find out later that evening that I arrived on the last day of the season. In Medford, one town away, I had booked a night at the Red Carpet Inn, basically a typical motel with outside access, and they served complimentary breakfast. I drove around downtown, parked my car around Main Street, and walked around, trying to find the Russian restaurant that I remember going to in a previous visit in June 1996, but never found it. Back then, smartphones were nonexistent and to google anything you would need a computer with 56k or broadband. I did find a Hawaiian restaurant, called the Hawaiian Hut, which would give me 10 miles credit on United Airlines for every dollar I spent. I had some nice spare ribs and white rice and it also had macaroni salad. I could not eat it all so they gave me a takeout box. I drove also to Grants Pass, because I wanted to see how far north away from home (at the time, Foster City, CA) I could drive, but in August 2013 I beat that, but that's a story for another time.\n\nAfter Grants Pass, I drove past Medford on to Ashland. It was the last day of the season for Shakespeare. I did not know of any performances I wanted to see, so I just strolled around downtown for an hour or so. Then I drove back to Medford to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, Sunday 2nd November, I slept in a bit more than I thought but not too long before they stopped serving breakfast, I was lucky to have some toast and coffee. I also had the leftover Hawaiian food from the previous night that I would eat later. I think I started back home at 10 AM. Before that, I had to fill up the tank, it was getting close to the 1/4 mark. Oregon diesel prices in 2003 were close to those in California, maybe a few cents cheaper. But you could not fill the tank yourself due to the Oregon state law forbidding self-service. I filled up, bought some soda for later, and then headed south on I-5, up that long incline past Ashland to Hilt at 55 mph, and then after Hilt downhill. Somewhere after Hilt there is supposed to be an agricultural checkpoint. That does not include leftover prepared food, just fresh fruits and such. I think it was about 11:30 AM when I arrived at the first rest stop in California from Oregon, so I ate up the leftovers. From Yreka to Weed the drive was fairly flat, then there came the curvy road down to Redding, and then flat from Red Bluff to Willows. At Willows I was getting hungry and I think it would have been around 4 PM when I arrived. I knew at the time, the Black Bear was also offering the 10 miles per dollar deal with United Airlines. I think I had just a sandwich and Coke. I stayed enough to rest up before the 200 mile journey back to Foster City. The car's fuel gauge had yet to break the 5/8 mark as it was getting around 51.0 mpg.\n\nThe drive home went fairly uneventful, other than a short stop close to Nut Tree in Vacaville. I think the rest of the way I went on I-80, I-880 to the San Mateo-Hayward bridge and my exit was at Mariner's Island Blvd in Foster City, which lead to my street. It would have been a little after 9 PM when I arrived at home. Luckily I did not have to be at work until 8 AM on Monday the 3rd November. I would have one week until my next international adventure to somewhere new. On my longest nonstop flight on United that I can remember.\n\nSo that was the last time I drove on I-5 to Oregon. Hope you enjoyed this Halloween story from so long ago.\n\nNext week, I should have the story of my fifteen year anniversary of my visit to Hong Kong, Macau and Tokyo Narita, but not Zhuhai in the PRC (though I was a quarter mile away from it, on the Macau side).\n\nSaturday 11 July 1998 - First time across the Oberbaumbrücke into East Berlin - Alexanderplatz and the world clock - Love Parade from 2 PM to 9 PM - supper at Escados and a long S-Bahn ride home to Nikolassee\n\n11 July 1998 Love Parade in Berlin\n\nHi everybody,\n\nToday 20 years ago, is part two of three, of the weekend in Berlin. It was also the day of the Love Parade 1998 - hence the hearts from my last post. It would not start until about 2 PM on Straße des 17 Juni, so I could get some sightseeing done before that and still take the U-Bahn.\n\nThe night was not too bad. My other roommates were not particularly noisy. The temperature was fair, about the low 50s by 7 AM. The showers were located in the hall.\n\nMy hostel had a breakfast room and breakfast was complimentary. It was the usual kind of breakfast at a typical Deutsches Jugendgästehaus, breads, cheese, butter, jam, hazelnut spread, sliced deli meats, orange juice, coffee and tea. I spent about half an hour. Then I went back to my room to get enough film for sightseeing. What I did not know was, I should have packed an extra camera battery. With the Samsung Evoca 115, it does not use conventional batteries. It uses a special U-Shaped battery about 5 volts called a \"CR123\". Will talk more about that for Sunday the 12th July. Then I walked the half mile to the Nikolassee train station but did not board a train, but a bus. This was because I wanted to go to Krumme Lanke along the U-1 into downtown and then take the S-Bahn from Heidelberger Platz to Innsbrucker Platz and take the U-4 to Nollendorfplatz. As for the Berlin U-Bahn map, please bear with me, as the lines have been reconfigured in the past twenty years that I last visited on my own, so I will likely mention the lines I remember from back then, rather than refer to the current line structure. As long as I still had the 72 hour pass, I did not need to worry about any \"Fahrscheinkontrolle\" that charged 80 D-Mark for not having a valid ticket.\n\nI took a double decker bus from Nikolassee to the Krumme Lanke U-Bahn station and took the U-1 to Heidelberger Platz. The line ran at-grade up to Podbielskialle and went underground for two more stops. I had to come out of the tunnel for the S-41 that went to Innsbrucker Platz. The entire U-4 is still underground as it was in 1998. When the train arrived in Nollendorfplatz, there were two underground levels and one elevated one. That is what makes Nolledorfplatz unique. I went farther on the U-1 to Warschauer Straße, across the Spree by the Oberbaumbrücke. I believe I already mentioned, that up to 1995, the U-1 terminated only at Schlesisches Tor on the east, as that was where the wall was, and Warschauer Straße happened to be in the Soviet-controlled \"East Zone\". Many of the stations in the East Zone in 1998 appeared to be preserved as they existed in the Cold War, but have in the last twenty years been renovated, so if you happened to be born after 1989, you might not be able to recognize which stations were in the East Zone and which were in the Allied sectors. Allied being the USA, UK and France. It was a profound feeling to see the Warschauer Straße station, as it was cut off from the rest of the U-Bahn network for decades.\n\nI had to walk across a pedestrian bridge at Warschauer Straße to be able to access the S-Bahn line. I wanted to see Alexanderplatz, the tower and the interesting world clock that must have 24 faces. The clock for many years did not have Tel Aviv or Jerusalem mentioned until that was changed in 1997, as it was GDR policy to not recognize the existence of Israel. I think The Bourne Supremacy had a scene in that particular square years later. I found a place where I might want to eat dinner, the Escados steak restaurant. They would be open until very late, I guess just before midnight, so I made a point to come back later that evening.\n\nAfter seeing Alexanderplatz, I wanted to go back to West Berlin, and the Checkpoint Charlie museum. To get there from Alexanderplatz, I needed to take the U-2 to Stadtmitte and then south to Kochstraße by U-6. In the Cold War, the U-2 was an operating line on both sides of the wall. However the U-6 had several \"ghost stations\" that had just the lights dimly lit while the trains just passed through and did not reopen until after Reunification.\n\nWhat luck, when I arrived at Kochstraße, the location of the iconic Checkpoint Charlie border crossing, the eponymous museum was open that day, so I decided to go inside for an hour or so. It was very interesting inside, with so much Cold War memorabilia. There was a Trabant that had a secret compartment to smuggle out people from East Germany to the West. And yes there was a controversial painting of Erich Honecker and Mikhail Gorbatchev, I will not go into any detail, you might look it up for yourself. As I had my passport with me, I paid 2.50 D-Mark to get a historical East Berlin border crossing stamp.\n\nI think at Alexanderplatz, during the Cold War, that was one of the official border crossings for the U-Bahn and S-Bahn. One of the rules for entering East Berlin from West Berlin, was that you would have to change 25.00 D-Mark into 25 Ostmark. More information about the Ostmark at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_mark. And all the Ostmark was required to be spent before returning to the West. Because the cost of living in East Berlin as compared to West Berlin was so cheap, it made spending money difficult. One way to tell the Ostmark from the D-Mark, is that the Ostmark coins were made out of lighter metal than the D-Mark coins. There were also Intershops that accepted only hard currency and sold western wares. All I am aware of, is what my high school German teacher taught in class, and also other peoples' experiences.\n\nAfter visiting the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, it was getting close to 1 PM. I stopped at a Kaiser Tengelmann store to buy food to make sandwiches, as I wanted to save money for a nice steak at Escados later. I love my Lyoner and Blutwurst so I bought some of that with slices of good looking white cheese, and some more soda cans. After that, I went on to Alexanderplatz, and then walked along Unter den Linden past the Berliner Dom and the then-standing Palast der Republik. The Palast der Republik was up to 1990, the parliament building for the East German government. Appearancewise, the Palast der Republik was made out of brownish copper and similarly tinted glass. It was a postwar brutalist style. People were gathering east of the Brandenburger Tor, as the Lovemobiles with the loud music were along Straße des 17 Juni.\n\nSo what is the Love Parade supposed to be? It was started in 1989 by DJ Dr Motte as a non-partisan political demonstration for peace and international understanding. And a great deal of electronic music which evolved from that of Kraftwerk. The Love Parade drew in later years up to 2003, about a million participants. To have a successful Love Parade, it is necessary to obtain funding and sponsors. In 2004 it was starting to be difficult to find sponsors and also the required permits in a timely manner. As for the music variety, I think there were 20 Lovemobiles in total, DJ Motte was at the head, there were others like DJ Marusha, Paul Van Dyk, Sven Väth, and Da Hool\n\nTwo of the drawbacks are, one of which, getting inadvertently dirty as a result of others drinking on the streets - glass was allowed as was aluminum and plastic, so it was necessary to watch one's step around areas where glass bottles were broken. There must have been an inch of garbage along the Straße des 17 Juni on average. I would not want to be part of the sanitation crew the next morning. Also, 11th July 1998 was one of the days that Germany had forgotten about its Mehrwegflasche recycling scheme - sad. The other drawback is if you do not have proper ear protection, you might have a horrible ringing of the ears. Foam earplugs were given out for free (someone donated for a bulk of them). Also during the Street Parade, the weather did not cooperate very well. Though it was in the upper 60s to lower 70s, there were periods of drizzle, alternating with periods of sunshine, and the DJs took special care to protect their equipment, so the music would last well into the late hours of about 10:30 or 11 PM.\n\nThe Love Parade was very large, in comparison to the little Marlboro cigarette garden parties from 1997 that I attended July 1997 in Hamburg and Munich, similar attire as the Love Parade, turnout of a thousand people each at most. Statistics show that there were 800,000 participants for 1998, so good turnout.\n\nRecommended videos Da Hool - Meet her at the Love Parade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO4y3nkJXDA Dr Motte & Westbam - One world, one future (the theme for the 1998 Love Parade in Berlin) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDJ20spGymE\n\nThere have to be about a dozen Love Parade 1998 videos online, some lasting as long as six whole hours. I leave it to you to decide whether to watch those, especially if you are on a mobile data plan – be careful of how much bandwidth you use unless you’re on Wifi or ethernet.\n\nI have to give the cleanup crew, security and first responders compliments on their professionalism. There was a little bit of humor when an ambulance was driving through the Straße des 17 Juni, and he said \"Please clear the street. You know how to do that, right? We all went to school didn't we?\". Then some silly person shouted \"Not I! Not I!\". Both exchanges were in German.\n\nThe next such parade I would attend would be the Street Parade, on 8th August 1998 in Zürich. That had a good turnout. I will tell more about it early next month.\n\nI got tired about 10 PM and thought it was time for dinner. I had to walk past the Brandenburger Tor, along Unter den Linden to Alexanderplatz. Escados was still open for late dinner. I ordered a 5 ounce steak with chili and summer vegetables, and had a Berliner Kindl beer with it. It was a fairly relaxing dinnertime after a long afternoon and evening with loud electronic music. But it was fun nonetheless.\n\nTo return to the hostel, I should have taken the direct S-Bahn to Nikolassee, but I chose a different route. I took a line 100 bus to Rosenthaler Platz to catch the U-8. This was part of the U-8 Ghost Station line in East Berlin, up to Gesundbrunnen which was considered to be in West Berlin. Then I took the S-1 \"the long way\" back to Nikolassee. Somehow Ingo Ruff's voice put me to sleep until about Mexikoplatz. I made it back to the hostel about 11:45 PM and I went to sleep.\n\nThe next day I would have to check out and make my way home to Munich. I did not know about the Third Place match for FIFA 1998, but I later found out Croatia beat the Netherlands 2 to 1.\n\nGute Nacht, bis morgen.\n\nFriday 10 July 1998 - ICE monoblock once again, after the Eschede disaster - ruins of the GDR in Potsdamer Platz - new cities on the world clock in Alexanderplatz - early evening in Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice, Poland\n\nToday twenty years ago, I went on a three day weekend to Berlin, Frankfurt an der Oder, Slubice in Poland and back via Leipzig and Nürnberg Hbf. This would be my second visit to Berlin overall, as my previous visit was in January 1997, not exactly the best time to visit. This time I planned to see more than I did then. Before you read any further, I plan to break the journey into three parts, Friday the 10th, Saturday the 11th and Sunday the 12th. Berlin is a big city, with so much history in the last 60 years at least, and proper time spent to enjoy it is necessary.\n\nI was able to take a day off work, as I had accumulated more than seven hours of overtime. I was not paid overtime but was allowed compensation days if certain conditions were met. I had to validate my Eurail Pass and use one day for the 10th going over to Berlin, and I paid 89 D-Mark for the return trip for Sunday the 12th (1998 FIFA World Cup Final, Brazil vs France). Already in May 1998 I had booked two nights at the Berlin youth hostel located near Wannsee in the former \"American Sector\". I took the early ICE high speed train called the \"Justus Freiherr von Liebig\" (1803 - 1873, bio: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig), the replacement for the \"Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen\", damaged about 11:10 AM on 3rd June 1998 in Eschede. Because the von Liebig train did not go to Berlin, but rather to Hamburg, I had to make a transfer at Fulda, to connect to the train for Berlin Zoologischer Garten, which in 1998 was the main terminus for eastbound trains as the current Hauptbahnhof was not yet built. The train left Munich about 5:35 AM. In 1998 the section between Munich, Augsburg and Nuremberg, were not high speed, neither was the existing section between Munich, Ingolstadt and Nuremberg, so it would not arrive in Nuremberg until about 6:55 AM. The morning was generally cloudy. I had my trusty \"coffee bottle\" with freshly brewed coffee in my backpack and about eight cans of soda at 330 mL each. The train stopped at Würzburg at 8:15 AM (Würzburg is the birthplace of Dallas Mavericks Dirk Nowitzki). It went not west to Aschaffenburg or Frankfurt, but rather north to Fulda, Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe and Göttingen before going further north to Hannover and Hamburg. The train arrived at Fulda about 9:10 AM. I listened to the Hessischer Rundfunk top of the hour news and heard All Saints' cover version of Red Hot Chili Peppers \"Under the bridge\" after that. At Fulda I alighted and had to wait for the Intercity train to Berlin. I would have been able to continue with an ICE train but due to the disaster at Eschede, lines operated with the ICE-1 series had many taken out of service. So I made do with the IC, and it arrived on time at 9:12 AM. The train went through Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe, Göttingen, Braunschweig, Wolfsburg, Potsdam and Berlin-Wannsee station. The train arrived about 12:28 PM at Berlin Zoologischer Garten. Before exploring Berlin, there was some business to take care of at the station.\n\nIn Berlin, you can buy a single day pass at a reasonable price. I am not sure what it was in 1998 but in 1997 it was 10 D-Mark. For a three-day pass, namely a 72 hour pass, you can also get discounts on tours and various products. The cost was 29 D-Mark. There was a ticket in the booklet that BVG sold, and it had to be stamped before use. Stamped only once, otherwise it would be considered invalid by the ticket inspectors and I would have been subject to a fine of 80 D-Mark. I stamped the pass, and then headed on the S-7 to Nikolassee via Westkreuz. The trains were of the BR-481 series, and stations announced by the voice of Ingo Ruff, as I remembered from January 1997. My hostel was, despite being located near Wannsee, was actually closer to the Nikolassee station. And about a half mile walk from Nikolassee. I checked in and left my luggage on the free bunk bed in the room. As it was the Love Parade weekend, the hostel would be very full. I rested for a few minutes, and before I left, I took my Eurail Pass with me and my remaining cans of soda in case I were to get thirsty on the way. The coffee bottle was empty.\n\nAfter a short rest, I left the hostel about 2 PM, with only my small bag with sodas, my Eurail pass, and passport. It was time to explore Berlin. I walked back to Nikolassee to take the S-Bahn to Potsdamer Platz. I wanted to not take the S-7 but the S-1, which was possible. The difference is going through Anhalter Bahnhof, Potsdamer Platz and Friedrichstraße underground, where S-7 is either elevated or at-grade only. At Yorckstraße I was listening on my radio to RTL 105.6 FM. Then when the train went underground for Anhalter Bahnhof and I lost the signal. Oh well.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Anhalter Bahnhof was the last station in the West Berlin S-Bahn, before approaching the Berlin Wall, as the next station would be Potsdamer Platz which was closed then. Both stations in 1998 looked like they were nicely refurbished after Reunification. I exited Potsdamer Platz to have a look around to see how much of the wall I could still see. Most of it had been torn down, and in 1998 there was only the empty space remaining. If you were to look at an aerial photo of it today, you would not be able to really tell that there was once a wall. The area has long since been built up. I did find a wall to take a selfie from, and I managed to find a wooden wall. If I could not find a cement wall, I thought, well, the wooden one will do, it is close to the original site anyway. So, there you have it, the story of the selfie of me trying to climb a wall.\n\nBetween Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate, there was a small memorial to the victims of the Third Reich. Honestly I do not know if that was erected either during the Cold War or after Reunification. I have only a few photos of that.\n\nBecause the Brandenburger Gate was not too far, I decided to walk on over. Brandenburger Tor was probably the most famous landma"
