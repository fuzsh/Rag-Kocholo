        "text": "That thread about the London Underground got me thinking. Because if you think about it, the alternate evolution of the U-Bahn in Berlin is even more curious than that of the tube. True, London has its own peculiarities due its immense age (no escalators before about 1900).\n\nBut Berlin has so much more, if only because OTL politics put more of its traces into concrete than anywhere else. There are many factors you'd have to count for in different ATLs. Needless to say, there were very plans that were never fulfilled.\n\nBut let's first take a glance on OTL for starters. Both maps come from Wikipedia Commons.\n\nThe first map shows the evolution of the present-day U-Bahn network of Berlin. The darker, the older and therefore more POD-resistant. The dotted red lines are extensions planned in the long run, meaning sometime in this century whenever poor Berlin ever found itself getting rich by own means.\n\nThe second map is showing the S-Bahn network of Berlin, twenty years after reunification. The only reason I'll show you that is less about the thick lines in front, but rather about the thin lines behind. The red lines are trams and the blue lines are subways (U-Bahn). Do you see how northeastern portions of Berlin have many red lines and how western and southern portions have many blue lines, but not vice versa?\n\nThat's because West Berlin axed its trams completely while East Berlin did this to lesser extent, and because the U-Bahn in West Berlin came to provide transport needs that used to be served by the S-Bahn that the West Berliners boycotted because they didn't want to finance the GDR as it belonged to the East German \"Imperial Railways\" in its entirety. No penny should ever go to Ulbricht and finance the death strip!\n\nGenerally, the policy in West Berlin was phasing out the trams and counting for the special transport needs of an isolated city lacking its traditional core, leaving a public transport completely reliant on the U-Bahn and busses. The extension of the U7, the compelety new U9 and the now abandoned plans for a U10 are legacies of the division.\n\nLess motorized East Berlin only axed the trams in its inner city and decided ad hoc if it accessed new commuter towns via S-Bahn (sometimes), tram (mostly) or U-Bahn (once with the present-day U5).\n\nYou see, you can change a lot about rapid transit in Berlin by employing just the right PODs.\n\nEDIT: In order to not miss the forest for the trees of OTL, here's a map from 1931.\n\nA classical POD: Weimar survives, no WWII, no German division, no Berlin division and Berlin rather remains an asset than turning into a liability.\n\nThe first post-war mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, also used to be the traffic mayor of Berlin from 1926 onwards. So when he came with his \"200 kilometer plan\", he actually refurbished plans from the Weimar era, therefore they're fair game for a scenario.\n\nSmall profile lines\n\nNB: As the oldest and partially elevated lines, they aren't as distinctally separated from each other as more modern lines and actually often recombined. The station Wittenbergplatz in Schöneberg actually serves as a collector/distributor station. Therefore I'll designate the lines for their termini rather than their modern numbers from said station's perspective.\n\nWarschauer Straße (east end of modern U1)\n\nUhlandstraße (west end of modern U1)\n\nKrumme Lanke (west end of modern U3)\n\nRuhleben (west end of modern U2)\n\nPankow (east end of modern U2)\n\nUhlandstraße\n\nBeing the tiniest dick of them all (only rivaled by the U4 Nollenbergplatz-Innsbrucker Str.), it was planned to make it penetrate even further into Wilmersdorf up to Reichkanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz) in its outskirts heading to Spandau, providing transfer to the Ruhrleben line.\n\nFurther extensions from Reichskanzlerplatz to Spandau from south to north were envisioned. For modern OTL plans, check out the U10/U3 section.\n\nRuhrleben\n\nAlready belong to Spandau, it served virtually all Spandau passengers until the 1980s. Especially after the war, it was (and still is planned to lesser degree) to extend it even further in Spandau, in its entirety in the beginning and only to its central tradional town hall now, IOTL present instead and IOTL former times alongside the Uhlandstraße line. From a 1930 perspective, the moderate modern plans may seem more considerate.\n\nKrumme Lanke\n\nAt first it was supposed to be become more comprehensive, but an absolute must up to this day is its extension to Mexikoplatz for transfer to S-Bahn.\n\nPankow\n\nOr what is now called Vinetastraße which IOTL was extended to another \"Pankow\" station where you can transfer to the S-Bahn after 1990. IOTL there were now abandoned plans to further extend the Pankow line to \"Breite Straße\" (lit. \"wide street\"), but ITTL its very reason may well be moot, it's about transfering to the U9.\n\nWarschauer Straße\n\nIt's been planned to extended this line up to Bersarinstraße (IOTL present \"Frankfurter Tor\", inbetween its name was \"Stalinallee\", yes, after Uncle Joe) since the line E (modern U5) was built. Only history didn't make it happen, but its a must in any timeline.\n\nU4\n\nNever extended since its inception in 1908, beyond its southern terminus Innsbrucker Str., there used to be storage sidings, but they were cut off when its necessary tunnel had to made way for a tunnel for Berlin's circle Autobahn. Its north could theoretically be expanded, the south not so much, even in other timelines because any boulevard péripherique screams for realization.\n\nU5\n\nOr line E in its inception from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde. It was originally planned to expand it to Karlshorst, transfering to the S-Bahn.\n\nIt's mansion neighborhood best known for being the place where Wilhelm Keitel signed the unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht. The Soviet occupiers also resided in there. The initial GDR extension to Tierpark (East Berlin Zoo) didn't contradict that, but extension in the late 80s rendered these plans moot. In other timelines, extension to Karlshorst is still very likely.\n\nAs some of you know, we currently have a U55 in OTL Berlin, an isolated part of an eventual extension of the 5 between Alex and Central Station, covering the cultural and political core of Berlin, that won't be butterflied away. The extension to Jungfernheide (U7) may still be plausible, but Flughafen Tegel is a child of the Berlin blockade, so it's safer to assume that Tegel Airport wouldn't exist.\n\nU6\n\nATL = OTL. It also has a station at Tempelhof Airport, the only question is what will replace Tempelhof when it becomes too small.\n\nU7\n\nATL = OTL. Alright, it's more complicated.\n\nIt ends at Rathaus Spandau nowadays and there used to be plans to extend it to Staaken in its west end. Seriously, Spandau was envisioned to have three subway lines more or less on its own for some time (now it's \"only\" two), all transfering at Rathaus/Bf. Spandau. On the other end, Rudow was also its long-term end.\n\nAn extension to Schönefeld Airport is highly speculative due to the question of its very existence. It arose on the grounds of a demontaged aircraft factory after all. There is a tradition until about 1930, but no Nazis also means no demontage.\n\nU8\n\nIOTL, the only southern extension was to Hermannstraße as a transfer to the U7 and that was after 1990. Originally, it was to get even more into the south, but more and more stations got scrapped over the decades, partially because the entirely Western U7 came to serve parts of what the U8 was supposed to serve, i.e. Gropiusstadt.\n\nIn the north, the U8 actually expanded a bit more IOTL than was originally planned.\n\nU9\n\nThe U9 is the youngest subway line of Berlin and a direct child of Berlin's division. It's safe to say that a north-south line via City West will not exist ITTL, at least not in the way that manifested itself IOTL.\n\nU10/U3\n\nIn the 1920s, Berlin planned a subway line from Weißensee in the northeast to Alexanderplatz. In alternate timelines, they can go either way, but preferably west.\n\nAfter the war, plans were expanded because now said subway was also to replace the S1 in the southwest of Berlin because it belonged to the GDR. As history marched on, this S-Bahn replacement was never built and eventually dropped. What remained of the U10 plans, namely everything from Potsdamer Platz eastward, became part of new U3 plans. The altered western branch of the new U3 will incorporate what I called the tiniest dick among the cape gauge lines (Uhlandstraße) that will therefore be converted to standrd profile and will of course bring its old extension plans into that marriage.\n\nWhat is now the U3 (Krumme Lanke) will fuse with the U1 (Warschauer Straße) once the U1 lost that tiny dick (Uhlandstraße) due to conversion.\n\nNoticable S-Bahn lines\n\nNord-Süd-S-Bahn as IOTL\n\nOst-West-S-Bahn\n\nto be continued...\n\n@ FDW: Thank you, very much!\n\nNo Hitler, no war and no division of Berlin has further ramifications.\n\nNo war means no bombings and no loss of shelter other than by local authorities. The problem is that ideas for urban planning didn't come out of nowhere during the war, but actually have their roots in the 20s and 30s. And while the mere height of OTL Gropiusstadt is due to the Berlin Wall, its mere site was already planned in the 1950s, albeit as maybe five-storied apartment complexes. And things like these could still crop up everywhere, whether at OTL sites or elsewhere.\n\nSo while the eastern extent of U5 (East Berlin) and U7 (West Berlin) would rather not equal OTL, its not that network extensions of that kind wouldn't happen at all, only with less \"Plattenbau\" projects and more garden towns and possibly at other sites.\n\nAs I said, the U9 is a direct child of the division and therefore be scrapped ITTL. The modern western extent of the U7 as well, that's what I missed to tell you. In the beginning, it was nothing more than the southeastern branch of the C line, the C I; the other branch, the C II, stayed with the main line and eventually became the U6. Track separation is always good, so we assume this to come in any timeline. But the thing is that there are still reasonable differences between the post-war \"200 kilometer plan\" that did ignore the political division, but not the real commute that oriented towards City West instead of the Old Centre, a thing that wouldn't happen in a non-divided Berlin and therefore not in my scenario. For the U7, this would mean that it definitely wouldn't extent westwards because of absence of valid subject matter, i.e. connecting Neukölln with City West while bypassing East Berlin (i.e. Old Centre) and replacing the boycotted S-Bahn lines, especially running parallel to the S-Bahn circle line in its southwest in a distance of less than a kilometer inside of it.\n\nOn the other hand, an independent C I/U7 could still extent into the centre of Berlin ITTL and anywhere else beyond it. There's a reason why the modern U7 has a \"knob\" IOTL, at Möckernbrücke, it provides Neukölln with a direct connection to the ancient U1 and therefore reduces congestion at Mehringdamm. This could still happen ITTL as well, especially if it's supposed to be extended at all, e.g. to Anhalter Bahnhof.\n\nBerlin as a continuous capital of a capitalist Germany (and primate city of at least Prussia) would, in its entirety and not only \"West Berlin\", be considerably richer than IOTL as its high-rise industry wouldn't have fucked off to the Rhine and Berlin would have profited from their national budget in the same way London and Paris have always done to this day. The S-Bahn wouldn't have been run down, therefore leaving more resources to other projects, and due to ubiquitous motorization, the trams may have been axed in their entirety, but not before building a proper U-Bahn to replace them. What had happend IOTL to just West Berlin and the inner parts of East Berlin might have happened here as well, but to all of Berlin, of course. And of course, Berlin isn't bankrupt ITTL.\n\nThis would first and foremost have ramifications for Berlin's northeast compared to OTL. Beside the U10/U3 mentioned earlier, the modern zoning plan of Berlin introduced a very new U11 that would serve much of eastern Berlin along Landsberger Allee with Berlin Central (Lehrter Bf.) while bypassing Alexanderplatz in its north. True, the exact route in central Berlin may well differ, but the part about Landsberger Allee screams for realization ITTL.\n\nLike Paris to this day, Berlin used to have several termini, those surviving the war were eventually demolished for being obsolete (and their names survived as S-Bahn stations) and lacked a real central station. IOTL, it's eventually been Lehrter Bahnhof that became Berlin Hbf, but it didn't come without criticisms. Of course it's in walking distance to Germany's political center and constructing on a ruin with no traffic whatsoever is smoother than turning a running station into a construction site. But hey, why couldn't you just extend the old Bf. Friedrichstraße where most S-Bahn lines cross anyway and where you already have U-Bahn and extended the tram? For \"Lehrte\", you have to build the \"Chancellor Subway\" and with the expection of big politics and a jail, there's actually nothing out there, that's what they already said in the 19th century when Lehrte was built!\n\nFirst of all, you could argue if anything like a central station would ever be built in Berlin at all and if yes, where. Of course, this often means no new U-Bahn, or OTL or \"close enough\" routes realized decades earlier, or something radically else, but what?\n\nTempelhof will become small time after time, but where exactly would TTL's Berlin have built a new international airport? Would it actually be accessed via U-Bahn after all?\n\nThere have been plans for an East-West-S-Bahn since Weimar times (and a similar U-Bahn line before), but the modern OTL iteration that only got scrapped after reunification and is currently served by a bus line M29 only came up with Hitler's Germania plans. Especially west of Moritzplatz, Ernst Reuter in 1926 envisioned it more as a southeast-northwest line. Instead of heading via Kochstraße to Anhalter Bahnhof (and Potsdamer Bahnhof in post-war plans), it would have gone (via whatever inbetween) via Friedrichstraße and Lehrter Bahnhof, serving the two trains stations, and penetrated further into Moabit where it would like have reconnected with the circle line. Of course, there are multiple ways a new S-Bahn ancestral line (which I may call S6 or S6X family) could look like in the end or even reduced to a mere U-Bahn in eventual realization, but you have to admit that a new central radial line beside the two that we know, the latter of them (north-south) built and completed in the 1930s, is some really neat meat.\n\nJust like in London and Paris, a big Berlin may suffered comparable congestion issues in an otherwise well developed subway network.\n\nIn London, the Jubilee Line was first and foremost built to release burden from established lines, provisions for unserved places only being a nice extra.\n\nIn Paris, the RER A (also some kind of S-Bahn) was partially designed to release burden from Métro line 1, but became so attractive that it suffered the same fate, prompting the extension of line 1 to La Défense, but provided new stops and attracted further congestion, it became a catch-22. The last draw in this game was the new line 14, the Météor, partially running parallel to RER A and line 1 and finally relieving the congestion issue.\n\nThere would remain the unsolved question where any \"unbearable congestion\" would come up in TTL Berlin.\n\nOh, what kind of U-Bahn plans might come for the western parts of Berlin that IOTL got served by U7 and U9?\n\nIf Berlin lacks all trams it had in the end but come en vogue in the latest 20th century again, where would they be built? In Paris, they connect the outskirts of the Métro among other things."
