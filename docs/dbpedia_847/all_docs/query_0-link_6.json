        "text": "The S1 connects Berlin Wannsee to Oranienburg in Oberhavel County, Brandenburg via Zehlendorf and Schöneberg. It travels through the North-South S-Bahn tunnel and stops at Friedrichstraße via Gesundbrunnen. The line runs every 20 minutes to Oranienburg and offers passenger services at 10-minute intervals between Wannsee and Frohnau during the day and between Zehlendorf and Gesundbrunnen during the evening. From Monday to Friday, there is even a 5-minute interval during rush hours between Zehlendorf and Potsdamer Platz now. (These trains are not available during the Christmas and summer holidays.) The S1 runs every 30 minutes through the night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe S25 runs from Teltow City in the county of Potsdam-Mittelmark via Südkreuz, through the North-South S-Bahn tunnel with a stop at Friedrichstraße via Gesundbrunnen, and ends in Hennigsdorf in the county of Oberhavel. Trains on this line run every 20 minutes. During the day, the 20-minute interval is shortened to a 10-minute interval between Teltow City and Bornholmer Straße (Mon-Fri) and between Teltow City and Potsdamer Platz (Sa + So) (on the S26). The train runs every 30 minutes through the night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe S26 runs from Teltow City in the county of Potsdam-Mittelmark via Südkreuz, through the North-South S-Bahn tunnel with a stop at Friedrichstraße via Gesundbrunnen and Pankow, and ends in Blankenburg in Pankow (district of Berlin). In the Bornholmer Straße <> Blankenburg section, there is thus an approximate 5-minute interval Mon-Fri during the day together with the S2 and S8. Otherwise, the line runs at 20-minute intervals and is condensed to 10-minute intervals in sections by the S25. On weekends the S26 runs Teltow city <> Potsdamer Platz. There is no night service on this line.\n\nThe S3 departs from Erkner through the woods and on the lakeside of Köpenick. It travels through the heart of Berlin with stops at Friedrichstraße, Berlin Hauptbahnhof, and Olympiastadion with a final stop in Spandau. The line runs every 20 minutes.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, the line runs at 10-minute intervals between Erkner and Charlottenburg during peak times. Outside peak times, the line runs at 10-minute intervals only between Friedrichshagen and Ostbahnhof. During the summer, the S3 runs every 10 minutes between Erkner and Ostbahnhof on Saturdays and Sundays; but in the winter, there is only a 10-minute interval between Friedrichshagen and Ostbahnhof on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nTogether with the S9, the S3 runs between Ostbahnhof and Spandau at 10-minute intervals. Additional trains will operate between Karlshorst <> Ostbahnhof from Monday to Friday at 20-minute intervals (These trains are not available during the Christmas and summer holidays.). The S3 runs every 30 minutes through the night on Friday and Saturday between Erkner and Ostbahnhof.\n\nThe S41 is a ring line that’s approximately 37 km in length and runs clockwise stopping at stations: Südkreuz, Westkreuz, Gesundbrunnen, Ostkreuz, and Südkreuz. Trains on this line take 59 minutes to circle. At numerous stations, there are transfer options for long-distance, regional, S-Bahn, and U-Bahn trains.\n\nThis line usually runs every 10 minutes. However, on Mondays to Fridays, a 5-minute interval is offered from about 5 AM to 10:45 AM. During the midday period from about 11 AM to 2 PM, a 5-/5-/10-minute interval applies, i.e. every third train runs at 10-minute intervals. Afterwards, a pure 5-minute interval applies again until approx. 8:45 PM. Saturday and Sunday there is also a 5-/5-/10-minute interval from approx. 12 AM to 8 PM.\n\nPlease note: Ring trains run at 15-minute intervals through the night on Friday and Saturday and take about 75 minutes to circle due to the waiting time for connecting trains.\n\nThe S42 is a ring line that’s approximately 37 km in length and runs counterclockwise stopping at stations: Südkreuz, Westkreuz, Gesundbrunnen, Ostkreuz, and Südkreuz. Trains on this line take 59 minutes to circle the ring. At numerous stations, there are transfer options for long-distance, regional, S-Bahn, and U-Bahn trains.\n\nThis line usually runs every 10 minutes. However, on Mondays to Fridays, a 5-minute interval is offered from about 5 AM to 10:45 AM. During the midday period from about 11 AM to 2 PM, a 5-/5-/10-minute interval applies, i.e. every third train runs at 10-minute intervals. Afterwards, a pure 5-minute interval applies again until approx. 8:45 PM. Saturday and Sunday there is also a 5-/5-/10-minute interval from approx. 12 AM to 8 PM.\n\nPlease note: Ring trains run at 15-minute intervals through the night on Friday and Saturday and take about 75 minutes to circle due to the waiting time for connecting trains.\n\nThe S46 connects the radio city of Königs Wusterhausen in the Brandenburg county of Dahme-Spreewald via Schöneweide, Neukölln, and the Südkreuz regional and regional train station. Shortly after passing the exhibition grounds, the train makes its final stop at Westend. The line runs every 20 minutes.

Route service is shortened and runs at 10-minute intervals between Hoppegarten (only Monday through Friday during rush hour) or Mahlsdorf (rest of the time) and Westkreuz. During the evening rush hour, passengers must transfer at Mahlsdorf; the onward journey continues on the opposite side of the station platform. Monday to Friday, during rush hours between Mahlsdorf and Ostbahnhof, additional trains are offered, so that there will now be a 5-minute interval between Mahlsdorf and Warschauer Straße (There trains are not available during the Christmas and summer holidays.). On Friday and Saturday nights, trains between Strausberg Nord and Mahlsdorf run every 60 minutes and between Mahlsdorf and Warschauer Straße, every 30 minutes.\n\nThe S7 connects Ahrensfelde to Potsdam via Lichtenberg.

For the first time, an S-Bahn line will split into two branches - at Bornholmer Straße. Please pay attention to the signs on the train and on the platform. Due to construction work, the S85 used to terminate in Waidmannslust until April 1, 2024.\n\nThe S9 connects BER airport via Schönefeld (bei Berlin) with the southeast (Adlershof, Schöneweide) and runs through the heart of Berlin, stopping at Friedrichstraße, Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Olympiastadion and Spandau. The line runs every 20 minutes: to the city center until about 2:00 AM and to BER airport via Schönefeld (bei Berlin) already from about 3:00 AM.
