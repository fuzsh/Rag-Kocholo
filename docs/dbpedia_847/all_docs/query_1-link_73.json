In September 2003 DB Reise & Touristik was renamed to DB Fernverkehr. A new subsidiary DB Personenverkehr now contains all passenger operations. Night trains (with brand name City Night Line) and the car shuttle Niebüll-Sylt were operated by DB Autozug. in October 2013 DB Autozug was merged into DB Fernverkehr, CNL was taken over by the Austrian Railways (not all lines).\n\nFreight traffic was operated by Stinnes, that used Railion Deutschland as trading name for all rail freight traffic formerly operated by DB Cargo.\n\nSince January 2008 DB has 3 main subsidiaries:\n\nDB Bahn for all passenger operations\n\nDB Netze for network and infrastructure related operations\n\nDB Schenker Rail Deutschland AG for freight and logistics\n\nIn 2016 DB Schenker Rail was renamed into DB Cargo (again). DB Netze is now InfraGO and DB Bahn is split up in DB Fernverkehr and DB Regio.\n\nDB Regio has been split again in 43 regional networks. Five of these have already been separated by integrating infrastructure and operation, and the use of dedicated stock. They can be found in a separate section of this stock list. Their names are Erzgebirgsbahn, Kurhessenbahn, Oberweißbacher Berg- und Schwarzatalbahn, SudOstBayernBahn and since the beginning of 2006 WestFrankenBahn.\n\nAlso the S-Bahn Berlin and S-Bahn Hamburg are subsidiaries of the DB AG holding company.\n\nIn 2023 production of DB Fernverkehr amounted 45.5 billion passenger-km, 9% more than in 2022. DB Regio traffic grew by 7.9% to 37.5 billion passenger-km. Both numbers are above 2019 pre-covid levels. However freight levels of DB Cargo were 11.9% less than in 2022, with 74.5 billion tonne-km.\n\nWebsites: http://www.bahn.de/ and http://de.dbcargo.com/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nDB Cargo locomotives and shunters\n\nDB Fernverkehr locomotives and trainsets\n\nDB Regio locomotives\n\nDB Regio trainsets and motor cars\n\nDB Netze stock\n\nDB historic stock\n\nDB withdrawn locomotive classes\n\nDB withdrawn trainset/motor car and departmental classes\n\nABR - Abellio Rail GmbH\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2020):\n\nno own tracks\n\nAbellio used to be known as EVAG-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH.

It has only operated the latter for two years, but the former will continue for 12 years. Since December 2007 Abellio also operates passenger trains on the Ruhr-Sieg Network, consisting of the lines Essen-Bochum-Hagen-Siegen (both express and local trains) and Hagen-Iserlohn (local trains).\n\nSince December 2013 Abellio operates passenger trains in the Saale-Thüringen-Südharz area, and on \"The Müngstener\" (Wuppertal Hbf-Remscheid-Solingen) with 9 new \"LINT\" diesel trainsets.\n\nIn 2013 Abellio (ABRN) has won the concessions to operate the Niederrhein Netz (Düsseldorf-Emmerich-Arnhem(NL) and Mönchengladbach-Wesel) from December 2016. New Electric trainsets were ordered for these services. The service to Arnhem in The Netherlands started in April 2017.\n\nIn December 2018 Abellio Rail Mitteldeutschland (ABRM) took over the operation of Dieselnetz Sachsen-Anhalt from Transdev company Harz Express (HEX) and DB Regio. It will operate this network until December 2032.\n\nAlso in December 2018 Abellio Rail NRW started operation on the first Rhein-Ruhr-Express (RRX) line RE11 Düsseldorf-Essen-Dortmund-Hamm-Kassel. In December 2019 line RE1 Aachen-Köln-Essen-Hamm followed. For these services the VRR regional body ordered new partly double-deck trainsets from Siemens. RE4, RE5 and RE6 will be operated by National Express with the same type of trainsets.\n\nSince June 2019 Abellio Rail Baden-Württemberg (ABRBW) operates trains on the Neckartal network around Stuttgart (the Rems-Fils and Franken-Enz network will be operated by Go-Ahead, a new UK-based operator for Germany).

With its tracks situated in the GDR and the eastern sector of Berlin after the war, the state railway DR took over its operations there, and the company, which continued to exist legally in West Berlin, was reduced to the administration of its assets there. Since 1994, it has resumed operating freight trains on its lines Berlin Karow(DB)-Basdorf-Groß Schönebeck and Basdorf-Liebenwalde. Since 1999 passenger operation is possible again, in the beginning carried out by DBAG with new \"GTW 2/6\" trainsets class 646.\n\nIn April 2004 Connex/NEB won the tender for passenger train operation on the lines mentioned above, from December 2005. New \"Talent\" DMUs were ordered. They also operate Berlin=Lichtenberg-Küstrin=Kietz since December 2006.\n\nSince December 2014 (first part) and December 2015 NEB operates Netz Ostbrandenburg, with modernised Regioshuttle motor cars and with new LINK trainsets from PESA(PL).\n\nIn 2020 passenger service over the original NEB line runs to Groß Schönebeck and Schmachtenhagen (RB71).

The middle part Markt Wald-Ettringen (7.1km) is lifted, but the space is still free.\n\nApart from freight trains, STVG operates passenger trains on saturdays on Türkheim-Ettringen and touristic trains on sundays between Augsburg and Markt Wald. Regular passenger services between Augsburg and Langenneufnach are to return from 2021.\n\nWith their locomotives they also operate open-access passenger and freight/work trains. The workshop is located in Augsburg.\n\nWebsite: http://www.staudenbahn.de/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nSTVG locomotives and motor cars\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2020):\n\n210km standard gauge, not electrified (SWEG Schienenwege GmbH)\n\nSWEG operates trains for different lines in Southwestern Germany: Verkehrsbetriebe Achern-Ottenhöfen (AO), Verkehrsbetriebe Biberach-Oberhamersbach (BOH), Verkehrsbetriebe Endingen (Kaiserstulbahn (KB), Riegel-Breisach/Gottenheim), Verkehrsbetrieb Meckesheim-Aglasterhausen-Hüffenhardt (MAH), Verkehrsbetrieb Schwarzach (Mittelbadische Eisenbahnen (MEN), Bühl-Söllingen), and Verkehrsbetrieb Staufen (Münstertalbahn (MT), Bad Krozingen-Untermünstertal). Since June 1997 they operate trains on DBAG lines around Freiburg under the name \"Breisgau S-Bahn\" with new Regioshuttle railcars. Their subsidiary OSB took over the operation of the AO and BOH lines in June 1998, together with some DBAG lines around Offenburg.\n\nOn 31 July 2009 the line Neckarbischofsheim-Hüffenhardt closed for passenger trains, although freight to the Gmeinder factory in Mosbach is still possible. The connecting line Meckesheim-Aglasterhausen is also closed but temporarily, as it will be electrified and integrated in the S-Bahn. Trains will then be operated by DB and no longer by SWEG.\n\nIn 2013 the Münstertalbahn was electrified, after which it was operated with 2 modern Talent-2 electric trainsets from Bombardier. As these are not compatible with the new Talent-3 trainsets for the Freiburger Y network, they have been sold.\n\nThe former SWEG AO and BOH lines are now operated by the Ortenau S-Bahn, that inherited 8 Regioshuttle diesel motor cars from SWEG for these services.Since December 2019 SWEG operates the \"Freiburger Y\" (Freiburg-Elzach, Kaiserstuhlbahn and Münstertalbahn), until then operated by SWEG and BSB. All lines will be electrified and new electric trainsets used.\n\nSummary of passenger services operated by SWEG in 2020: Kaiserstuhl S1 Endingen-Riegel-Freiburg, S2 Freiburg-Waldkirch-Elzach and S5 Breisach-Endingen-Riegel=Malterdingen, and Münstertal S3 (Freiburg-)Bad Krozingen-Staufen-Münstertal.\n\nOn 1 January 2018 HzL merged into SWEG, but for the time being HzL is being operated as a separate entity within the company. The Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL) used to operate all trains on Hechingen(DB)-Gammertingen-Sigmaringen(DB) and freight trains only on Hanfertal-Sigmaringendorf(DB), Hechingen-Eyach(DB), Balingen - Schömberg (13km taken over from DB in 2001) and Gammertingen-Kleinengstingen(DB). They also operated the trains for the BOB, and for the DBAG they operated trains on the Zollernalbbahn Ulm - Aulendorf - Sigmaringen - Tübingen and Sigmaringen - Tuttlingen (\"Donaukonzept\"). Since January 2002 HzL operated local freight trains from Plochingen and Ulm to 17 stations in the region Oberschwaben and Schwäbische Alb (Mora C).\n\nHzL has won the tender to operate the \"Ringzug\" from 12/2003. This involves hourly passenger trains south of Stuttgart, on the lines Bräunlingen-Donaueschingen-Villingen-Trossingen Stadt/Rottweil, Rottweil-Tuttlingen-Immendingen-Leipferdingen(-Zollhaus=Blumberg) and Fridingen-Tuttlingen. On 1 September 2003 the first Ringzug services already started. Since early 2006 HzL also operates trains on Radolfzell-Stockach, after the stock of Mittelthurgaubahn/Thurbo/SBB broke down. They won the tender to operate this line until December 2008, and the new tender for passenger trains up to December 2023 (now taken over by DB). Since June 2019 HzL operates the Ulmer Stern network (previously operated by DB), passenger services on Aalen-Heidenheim-Ulm-Ehingen-Munderkingen.\n\nOn 1 January 2018 HzL merged into SWEG, but for the time being HzL is being operated as a separate entity within the company. Summary of the services operated by HzL in 2020: seehäsle (Radolfzell-Stockach, until December 2023), Ringzug, Donaubahn (RB56 Ulm-Munderkingen), Brenzbahn (RE57/RB57 Aalen-Ulm), ZAB 1 (Tübingen-Balingen-Sigmaringen) and ZAB 2 (Hechingen-Gammertingen-Sigmaringen), plus a few walk/bike trains during summer weekends to Eyach, Schömberg and Engstingen. HzL now runs on railway lines managed by DB Netz or by SWEG Schienenwege GmbH. Freight is now also handled by SWEG.\n\nThe Ortenau S-Bahn (OSB) brand is used for services with modern Regioshuttle DMUs on Strassburg-Kehl-Offenburg, Offenburg-Appenweier-Bad Griesbach and Offenburg-Hausach-Freudenstadt/Gutach (DB Netz infrastructure) and Achern-Ottenhöfen and Biberach-Oberharmersbach (SWEG infrastructure). All lines together are about 200km of network length. From December 2023 SWEG operates these lines for 15 years with new battery trains from Siemens. In 2025 the then reopened Hermann-Hesse Bahn (Calw-Weil der Stadt-Renningen) will be included in the contract.\n\nBreisgau S-Bahn was the brand used for trains on Freiburg-Breisach, Riegel-Endingen-Breisach and Riegel-Gottenheim, and since 2002 also for Freiburg-Elzach. In 2019 this was discontinued. Part of the system is now electrified and operated by DB. Freiburg-Elzach is also being electrified but will still be operated by SWEG.\n\nFrom December 2021 SWEG wil take over Neckartal Los 1 (RB17, RB18, RE10 and IR6) from Abellio for 2 years, during which the concession will be re-tendered.\n\nWebsites: http://www.sweg.de/, http://www.hzl-online.de/, http://www.ringzug.de/ and http://www.ortenau-s-bahn.de/\n\nStock Tables:\n\nSWEG locomotives and motor cars\n\nHzL trainsets and motor cars\n\nOSB diesel motor cars\n\nNetwork length, gauge and electrification (2020):\n\nstandard gauge, not electrified\n\nAfter the split of Eurobahn between Rhenus and Keolis, the remaining part of Rhenus was operated under the name Rhenus Veniro.
