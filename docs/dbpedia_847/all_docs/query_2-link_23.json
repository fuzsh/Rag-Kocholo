        "text": "From a lecture presented by Hartmut Schnorr, 2nd Operating Manager Berlin S-Bahn and a Member of the Locomotive & Carriage Institution on 4th October 1996. Re-written by John Lunn & Tom Chaffin March 1997.\n\nFrom the March 1997 Newsletter.\n\nThe Development of the Railways in Berlin:\n\nAn important chapter in the history of the Berlin was the development of the different types of transport infrastructure:\n\nThe major European trade routes crossed in Berlin: the road from the Baltic Sea to Italy and the road from France to Russia;\n\nAn important condition for the growth of trade and manufacturing was the ability to ship goods from road to ship on the River Spree;\n\nIn 1880 Prussia had a very good road network for the period.\n\nWith the industrialisation at the beginning of the 19th Century some important companies were established in Berlin, amongst others, these included:\n\nBerlin Royal Foundry (established 1816);\n\nBorsig of Berlin (established 1837);\n\nBrlin Waterworks (established 1856).\n\nThe railway age began in Germany with the opening of the first railway between Nrnberg and Fhrt in 1835. It was then possible to transport quantities of people and goods over long distances quickly - the age of the post coaches was soon finished\n\nThe first German Emperor believed that the existing road network was sufficient to carry all the traffic on offer at the time, however the military authorities thought otherwise and as a result the first Prussian railway opened on 29th October 1838 between Berlin and Potsdam. The opening of the first railway was the initial step towards creating a railway industry in the Prussian state, which would then be free from having to import locomotives and rolling stock from England. This was important for both military and financial interests as the Prussian state wanted to be free from dependence on imported railway equipment.\n\nA rapidly growing Berlin needed special solutions for passenger transport because new plants and factories were situated outside the City and large amounts of workers needed to commute to these from their City Centre homes. There was also a demand for City dwellers to travel out into the countryside at weekends.\n\nIn the following years, between 1841 and 1879, an abundance of private railways opened in Berlin each with its own terminus. The only way to travel from one termini to the other was by horse drawn bus or coach and transfer of rolling stock between companies was impossible.\n\nIn 1851 a single track connection was built by the Prussian state connecting the following main stations: Stettiner Bahnhof, Hamburger Bahnhof, Potsdamer Bahnhof, Anhalter Bahnhof and Frankfurter Bahnhof. It was now possible to transfer rolling stock between companies in Berlin. The drawback of this single track railway was that it crossed many streets presenting a danger to road users; therefore a new elevated railway was planned bridging over the numerous street crossings.\n\nBy 1861 Berlin had expanded by 2500 hectares and in 1862 it was decided that the elevated railway should connect up all the mainline stations, thus the idea of a Circle Line, \"The Ringbahn Line\" was born.\n\nThe Stadtbahn Line.\n\nConstruction of the Stadtbahn (City Line), across the centre of Berlin, was started between Charlottenhurg Bahnhof and Schlesischer Bahnhof in 1872. Like the approaches to London Bridge Station, the line was built on arches. The line is 12Km Ion and passes over some 731 arches. To reduce construction costs the arches and bridges near Jannowitzbrcke were built in the River Spree.\n\nIn 1878 the Stadtbahn line company Stadteisenbahn-Gesellschaft went bankrupt and construction of the line was taken over by the Prussian State, completing; in 1882. The line was built with two double tracks at the then very high cost of 68.1 million RM. Passenger services commenced m 1882 over the following routes:\n\nCity to Charlottenburg;\n\nCity to Ringbahn and suburbs;\n\nCity to Wannsee, Potsdam, Spandau and Erkner.\n\nStadtbahn Line Opening Specifications:\n\nSome 25,000 passengers per hour could be transported in each direction;\n\nPlatform height was 960mm giving train door-height performs;\n\nTram headway was 2.5 minutes;\n\nMotive power was provided by high acceleration Class 74 steam locomotives;\n\nPassenger coaches were provided with doors at every seating bay for rapid loading and unloading reducing station dwell times.\n\nThe Electrification of the S-Bahn:\n\nThe Berlin system at this time was one of the best in the world, but operating the Ringbahn and Stadtbahn Lines with steam traction had as problems:\n\nThe steam locomotive was dirty;\n\n25,000 passenger per hour could not be exceeded;\n\nBy 1900 Berlin had become a significant cultural, economic and political centre, creating an even greater strain on the S-Bahn system.\n\nIn 1879 the first electric locomotive was demonstrated by Werner von Siemens and by 1881 the first tram line had opened in Spandau. Engineers and technicians quickly learnt the advantages of electric traction:\n\nMore rapid acceleration\n\nHigher speed;\n\nCleaner environment.\n\nThe following sections of line were electrified on different systems on an experimental basis:\n\n1898 to 1902 between Berlin Potsdamer, Bahnhof and Zehlendorf (12Km) on the Siemens 750V DC system;\n\n1903 to 1929 between Berlin, Potsdamer, Ringbahnhof and Lichterfelde Ost on the AEG's 550V DC system;\n\n1903 between Niederschoneweide and Spindlersfield with 25Hz AC.\n\nThe best results were obtained with the DC electrification, therefore the Berlin S-Bahn adopted the underside contact third rail system at 750V DC. Early electric rolling stock included the experimental vehicles in Classes A to F, these lead in 1923 to creation of the first production S-Bahn units of Class 169 or the \"Bernau Train\".\n\nRapid electrification of the system was not possible due to a number of reasons, chief amongst these being: the resistance of the German locomotive industry; World Was 1, and the economic difficulties caused by inflation in the years between 1922 and 1923.\n\nOn 8th August 1924 the 23Km of the S-Bahn between Stettiner Bahnhof and Bernau was opened with 750V DC electrification and 17 x 5car units of Class 169.\n\nClass 169 Formation:\n\nWith the closure of the border between East and West Berlin on 13th August 1961 the following lines were cut:\n\nBetween Soviet and Western Sectors:Sonnenalle - Treptower Park\n\nSchnhauseralle - Gesundbrunnen\n\nBornholmestr - Pankow\n\nKellnishe Heide - Baumschulenweg\n\nBetween West Berlin and Country Areas:\n\nFrohnau - Hohenneuendorf\n\nHeiligense - Hennigsdorf\n\nBerlin Staaken - Albrechtshof\n\nBerlin Wannsee - Dreilinden\n\nLichterfelesd - Teltow\n\nLichenrade - Manlow\n\nAs a result of the border closure, the Berlin S-Bahn was split into two illogical systems the only connection between them being through, Freidrichsrae station (Stadtbahn / City Line) which was kept open for the exchange of rolling stock for maintenance purposes and for a cross-border passenger service. For the next 23 years two thirds of the system lay in the west and only one third in the East.\n\nS-Bahn in the Western Sector:\n\nAs is now well recorded in history, West Berlin became the centre of the cold war between East and West Europe. The former East German Railways - Deutshe Reichsbahn (DR) had their headquarters in East Berlin and were responsible for operating the S-Bahn in both East and West Berlin. Eastern control led to a whole series of problems with the staff employed in West Berlin, but political interests were trying to prove that the socialist system was better than capitalism.\n\nOver time management of the West Berlin part of the system became more difficult and expensive to operate, made worse by DR having to pay for the operating costs for the West Berlin section in West marks (DM). As a result of these problems, ridership fell and parts of the system in the West began to close and infrastructure and rolling stock was left to decay.\n\nIn 1983 the GDR Government negotiated with the West Berlin authorities to take over the operation of the S-Bahn system inside West Berlin. Control of the system eventually passed to BVG (West Berlin Transport Authority) on the 9th January 1984. Between 1984 and 1993 the BVG reconstructed three routes and introduced new rolling stock of Class 480.\n\nNotable points in history between 1980 and 1992 are summarised below:\n\nThe Pilzkonzept: North - South Mainline Tunnel:\n\nThe first plans for a north-south connection between Stettiner Bahnhof and Potsdamer Bahnhof were made during the planning stages of the Stadtbahn Line. It was originally intended to build the line on arches, similar to the Stadtbahn Line, but due to property development it was later found impossible to build overground. In the last half of the 19th Century tunnelling techniques had not advanced sufficiently to tunnel through the sandy soil under Berlin.\n\nNow, at the end of the 20th Century, as Berlin's importance rises as a new European political, cultural and economic centre, with the return of the scat of German Government in a few years time, plans are once again being made for a North - South mainline connection. A tunnel will be built between Anhalter Bahnhof and Gesundbrunnen stations to provide a route for mainline trains running between Dresden, Halle, and Leipzig to Sweden, Rostock and Hamburg. Three new large interchange stations will be built at Potsdamer Platz, Stadtbahnhof and Gesundbrunnen to allow passenger transfer between the mainline trains and Berlin's different transport modes including the S-Bahn.\n\nSignalling Systems:\n\nThere are four signalling systems presently used on the S-Bahn: the SV system dates from the 1930's; the H1 system was developed and used on lines operating in East Berlin; whilst the BP system was developed in West Berlin after the BVG take-aver in 1984 and installed on the sections of line in the West and which remains m use; finally the KS system was introduced after the reunification of the system and will in time replace all the other systems.\n\nIt is intended to operate the entire S-Bahn system from an IECC at Westkreux, with a completion date early in the next century. The system is presently operated by 85 signalboxes which range from five mechanical boxes (operating colour light signals) through electro mechanical and panel boxes to five IECC's."
