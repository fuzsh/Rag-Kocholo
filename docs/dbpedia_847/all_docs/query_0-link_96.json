        "text": "Moritzplatz is a Berlin U-Bahn station located on the U8. Peter Behrens constructed this unusual subway station in Berlin in 1928. It was closed shortly in 1945 and from 1961 it was last station in West Berlin from whom the train had to pass eastern territory until Gesundbrunnen.\n\nOverview\n\nIt is unusual because the place where the station is now is not the place where it should be. The department store \"Wertheim\" had a big store on this place since 1913, and they gave the subway company 5 million Reichsmark, so that the plans were changed and the store got an direct subway connection. Also beyond the station there is a 40m long tunnel that should serve as a station for a fast train to Görlitzer Bahnhof. During the war this tunnel was used for air raid protection rooms. Since 1984 there is equipment for the power maintenance.[1]\n\nReferences\n\nPreceding station Berlin U-Bahn Following station\n\ntoward Wittenau\n\nU8\n\ntoward Hermannstraße"
