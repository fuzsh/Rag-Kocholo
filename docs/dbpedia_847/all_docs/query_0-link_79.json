        "text": "Retrofitting (Part I-1) - Let's Talk About The LRT At My Doorstep\n\nLike so many other cities in Germany, my own hometown got razed at the end of the war by British bombers. We used to have an intact continuous historic centre that's been lost forever, not unlike Frankfurt. Then again, we used the opportunity of the disaster to force wider streets and lower density onto our old town. We also got rid of the tramway in the 1950s. By the 1970s, our historic theater in the north and indoor pool in the south of our major boulevard (former east end of old town) got demolished in order to streamline said boulevard into our central north-south axis, sporting four underpasses along the way from north to south: Berlin Square/Theatre (still existing, also accessing a car park), Harmony Civic Centre (bus interchange west/north), the adjacent Boulevard Underpass with commerce where the boulevard and Emperor Street cross and at Post (bus interchange west/south, regional bus hub at the former indoor pool in walking distance). This was a clearly automotive city.\n\nIn 2000, however, the Boulevard Underpass was torn down and filled for building tram tracks on its surface that the Emperor Street already got two years prior and a provisional terminus right there was opened a year later. My own home in the rich east of town got its access in 2004 and through-routing in direction east came at the end of 2005. Harmony and Post underpasses were quickly closed and filled as well and the whole boulevard got walkable crossings again. By the early 2010s, the east-west line was supplemented by a northern connection. Through-routing? Yes, Heilbronn has been \"colonized\" by the tram-train system from Karlsruhe. The renaissance of streetcars has many mothers and fathers, but Karlsruhe is a poster child and role model because it managed to take underused electrified railway tracks and build a hybrid train that runs on both streetcar and mainline railway voltage.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Karlsruhe conducted studies that showed that the congestion to be combatted by shutting the tram would be even worse with busses. So they already skipped the abolition and started to streamline the whole system so that automotive and tram traffic was as separated as possible and doable. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the whole system grew not unlike the Manchester Metrolink where disused rail tracks got streetcar electrification. This was a solution in directions north, west and south, but not east. There's been an equally underused (though not dead) mainline railway with standard 15 kilovolt electification run by the DB, the Kraichgaubahn, mostly for freight traffic. So the AVG, the Karlsruhe transit authority, decided to have the cake and eat it too and built a hybrid train car which we'd call a tram-train nowadays. The first tram-train from Bretten to Karlsruhe went online in 1992. Passenger numbers exploded to an extent that the system became a victim to its own success. The most burdened inner-city lines of Karlsuhe will go underground from 2020 on. NIMBY protests were the reason why this didn't happen 10 years earlier.\n\nThink of the Kraichgau as a green heart of a \"randstad\" between the motorways A5, A6, A8 and A81 in northern Baden-Württemberg. Karlsruhe is where the A5 and A8 cross whereas Heilbronn is where the A6 and A81 cross and said railway just pierces through the green heart. The towns of Bretten and Eppingen get served along the way, they're a bit off the motorways which are known to be jammed every day at rush hour. This is great potential for a train that takes you to the heart of a big city and not just a train station. The other crossing from Mannheim to Stuttgart gets served by an ICE bullet train connection. By 1999, this tram-train terminated at Heilbronn Central Railway Station and by changing to new tram tracks later, this turned into a true interurban service. There's actually a morning express train fetching you at about 8.30 am and dropping at 9.40 am at the southern campus of the Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology, formerly the TU before merging with the now northern campus. So yeah, if you struggle to pay your rent, like mommy's food or both, that's a great way to attend the 10am lectures and avoid killing (or getting killed by) a roommate you never had. My version was taking the S4 from home to Eppingen and changing to the S5 and disembarking at Heidelberg Old Town as it's in the east of town and I come from due east anyway.\n\nThe streamlined tram-train system of the AVG as seen in the trains (in pdf)\n\nA more accurate illustration as seen at the stops (in pdf)\n\nRetrofitting (Part I-2) - Not Working Down There? Put It To Use!\n\nBack in the days, where I live in eastern Heilbronn used to be nothing more than a hill, the Lerchenberg or Lark Hill and its development started with certain public institutions. Its biggest defining feature is the Main Cemetery which set up shop first here around 1880. Right after 1900, a one-track railway tunnel was built under Lark Hill in order to access the industrial south side of Heilbronn with the rest of the railways. The northeastern mouth of the tunnel made the track straddle at the eastern edge of the cemetery, further northeast downhill was a sickbay from the 1890s that turned into the municipal hostpital after World War II. Today's city park at the opposite side of the hill was also built right after 1900. So there already was some life near my vicinity before World War I, but not a liveable neighborhood. Even further east, the early Wehrmacht built the Ludendorff Barracks that also became a target during World War II. It became a DP camp after the war before becoming a base for American armed forces. So the site of my grandpa's future family home was wedged between the cemetery and a train track in the west, a hospital in the north and barracks in the uphill east. There is an old house begging to be demolished in a back street behind me dating from 1938 (I read my real estate agents) and the grid must have stood by then, but it was largely empty before my wedged-in neighborhood was erected largely in the 1950s and 60s. There's also the fun fact that the rear part of my street also made for the hospital's uphill frontier. My mother used to have problems hearing ambulances at some distance and wondered why all the drivers made way before she noticed the ambulance behind her because she generously overheard the constant tatütata behind her very own home.\n\nSo the years went by and things started to change. The east end hospital was closed in 1989 and the birth clinics became the main hospital. The Cold War was over, the Americans left and barracks turned into neighborhoods and industrial parks. South Station was closed due to insufficient demand and the Knorr works (instant food tycoon, now part of Unilever) as its last holdout was forced to use trucks for its products. As the overhead wire for the city park's LRT station needed room, the railway bridge between the Lark Hill tunnel and the rest of the network was knocked down and crossing the track from my home to the cemetery was clearly safe. The Badener Hof, formerly barracks, became a nature-proximate neighborhood and makes for a handy new start and finsh loop for bus line 11. The former hospital became an extension of my neighborhood and features a nursery home at the opposite of the LRT station. And as we're already at it, I also tell you that my former elemetary school was built on the grounds of another fromer barracks razed in the 1950s together with the city's revenue service and police department. The former South Station that used to feature a gas station with car wash and a Turkish produce market has been revitalized as a 21st century neighborhood with only the supermarket in its very west surviving. A stop sign in my neighbood was downgraded to give right of way because the train tracks crossing the street after leaving the southwestern mouth of the tunnel are no longer in use. But here's the thing: What happens with the tunnel?\n\nLast year, a society has been registered whose aim is to put the Lark Hill tunnel into good use, specifically for pedestrian, cyclists and skaters. Here you have flat tunnel under a hardly accessible hill and connecting the parks in the east with those at the central south at the Neckar river makes for a great benefit, especially as former South Station features bike lanes ending in the east for the moment that can't stay that way forever. I have a personal interest in this connection. I live at the northeastern mouth and the southwestern mouth is in walkable distance to registered doctors and my GP, a nursery home, a bistro-bakery, a stationery shop (elementary school nearby), a bakery and a butchery attached, an ATM and a street letter box. This tunnel should be used, but there won't be any streetcars running through even if the suburbs at the disused line that this tunnel has been indirectly been built for should have a LRT one day. They will however need to find a new course through the city's south side. Deal with it.\n\nTopografic map of my hometown and environs from 1902 in 8K\n\nYou see that the Lark Hill underpassed by the tunnel was yet wineyards, the bends of the 200 metre contour line in the north-northeast of the wineyeards roughly follow the future path of my street. You also see the nucleus of Röntgen Street (of X-ray fame, No. 9 was built in 1938 and finds no buyer) and Mandry Street which was just produce back in the days. Most of the streets to be built here later were named after doctors and scientists.\n\nRetrofitting (Part I-3) - Dude, Where's My Fibre?\n\nInternet access is a disaster in some parts of what we call the First World. I'm lucky living a city environment where there's ubiquitous 50 Mbit/s over the traditional phone line, though hardly more. Cable TV also costs just 20 quid per month which is cheap compared to America and if I wanted, I could get even faster internet over my cable provider. Our physical cable was laid in the earliest 1990s, so it's good and fresh enough to go and one tenant even used it for internet access. LTE can be an alternative where the wires are weak but mobile radio is strong. The \"final solution\" to the data problem would be true fibre to the home, however. And yes, here you can get fibre internet access by the local utility provider, but not everywhere. Look at that drop-down menu with the word \"Wohnort\" (residence) where you can see where their service is available and you'll see that they don't categorize first and foremost by municipal borders, but rather by projects. Some \"residences\" are indeed whole villages, small towns and neighborhoods and they've been accessed because traditional internet connections are abysmal out there and people got together to make the city works do what Deutsche Telekom won't do. All addresses can and will be served out there for just this purpose. Then there are redeveloping projects that are yet under construction or recently finished. There you'll find just a few streets where ZEAG offers you true fibre to the home. Those are a former plot of horticultural greenhouses wedged between railtrack dams and the modern LRT station near my home (Jägerhausstraße), the Southern City Yards I mentioned (Happelstraße) and the future docklands neighborhood to open after Garden Show 2019.\n\nEDIT: I outsourced some pictures to this post as you can only have 10 at a time and I didn't want to spam. The first image shows the maiden grid of my neighborhood right before World War II, the streets initially christened after military brass and as such instrumentalized by the Nazis for propaganda reasons. Yes, also Lettow-Vorbeck, you fanboys at AH.com. They were quickly renamed after the war, mine after a July 20th complicit, most after famous physicians, Ludendorff Street became Einstein Street. The other two show U.S. Army barracks near the end of the Cold War and how the rest of the city has matured to grow into them to some degree.\n\nAttachments\n\nCloseup Home 1938.jpg\n\nSouthern Barracks 1988.jpg\n\nEastern Barracks 1988.jpg\n\nRetrofitting (Part II-1) - European Terminals Get Their Open Heart Surgery\n\nBelgrade, Republic of Serbia, 30th June 2018:\n\nThe old main terminal of Belgrade (Beograd-Glavna) at the right bank of the Save River before it enters the Danube River will be closed after this night. Beograd Centar, nicknamed Prokop by locals, will take over most of its remaining functions in the morning of July 1st and the rest will be dispersed among other terminals, like Topcidar which will take over the car train to the Adriatic Sea in Montenegro. What yet has to be finished at Beograd Center is supposed to become so by the end of the decade. Did I mention that construction started in 1977?\n\nBelgrade is Europe's biggest railway development hell to be recently finished if you count by the time since the start of construction. The breakup of Yugoslavia and the adjacent political instability in Serbia are largely to blame for this. Then again, it's also a poster child for many other metropolitan transit projects because it's the closest thing to an actual clusterfuck of epic proportions and is therefore especially symptomatic for many perceived and actual problems other projects elsewhere face as well.\n\nSo What Is It All About?\n\nBelgrade has a delicate geography and topography that suits poorly to major reconstruction projects that overtaxes the economic prowess of a Balkan state that nonetheless is forced to function due to its strategic location even if it's too much to ask. Belgrade and environs is where the flat Pannonian Basin in the north and the Dinarian Mountains in the south meet. Clockwise from the south, Old Belgrade south of the Save and Danube Rivers is very hilly and makes for the only part that belonged to the Kingdom of Serbia. New Belgrade near Zemun in the west between the Save and Danube Rivers is flatland which allow ed for an easy expansion of Belgrade after the Vojvodina became part of Yugoslavia. The part north of the Danube ain't part of Belgrade proper and makes for the southern end of the Vojvodina.\n\nBeograd Glavna was an extension from (Budapest-)Zenum via Novi Beograd and a Save railway bridge. Beograd Dunav makes an extension from (Romania/Banat-)Pancevo via the same-named bridge. Accessing Beograd with its northwestern and northeastern neighbors was a political quagmire before World War I, so to speak and the railway is a symptom for local 19th century geopolitics and therefore a prime alternate history target. If you look at Old Belgrade, you see some small valleys among the hills:\n\nBelgrade Waterfront at the shore of the Save River as it will be called after Beograd Glavna will be demolished.\n\nProkop, a valley to the southeast of the Waterfront that quickly ends in a cul-de-sac. This is where Beograd Centar has been built.\n\nTopcider, due southwest and the valley that accessed Glavna with the rest of Serbia and the south in general.\n\nIn a nutshell, the new Save railway bridge goes straight northwest-southeast from Novi Beograd into the Prokop valley. Two tunnels had to be pierced through the hills in order to access Prokop beyond the cul-de-sac: Dedinje tunnel into the south and Vracar tunnel into the northeast. This through-routing scheme allowed for Beovoz or BG:voz to have become a real crossrail scheme for 20 years before mainline railways finally ditched Glavna for Centar. This is because the times have become so modern that piercing tunnels through the hills is actually way easier and cheaper than building the stations within.\n\nBelgrade Ain't Alone With Shenanigans\n\nPRAGUE\n\nJust as Belgrade has a fully reformed railway node but no proper rapid transit, Prague is quite the opposite. Accessing Praha hl. n. from the north has always been a drag, so Masarykova had to take the burden even if it's considered out of repair and cumbersome enough that there's talk of giving it up entirely. Suffice to say, Prague's railway node has to make up for lost time and needs some serious additional capacity. The first step has been done from 1999 to 2007 with the construction of the New Connection, a big viaduct and a set of new tunnels replacing older ones to make for a comfortable access of northern lines to Praha hl. n. The opening of the New Connection coincided with the introduction of the commuter rail system Esko. Many northern lines have both a branch ending at Masarykova and a branch to Praha hl. n. Yet this does little to improve capacities at Praha hl. n. which is supposed to not be able to overtake the burden from Masarykova. The best way to replace an old commuter rail terminal that somehow stands in the way is replacing it with a tunnel and Prague has also come to its senses.\n\nYou know how Liverpool Street Station on the Elizabeth Line will also access Moorgate as it's so big?\n\nPrague Opera will similarly straddle between Main Station and Museum and got a new name to express this.​\n\nThis is usually called the New Connection II and involves a double crossrail connecting Bubny and Karlin in the north with Smichov and NBS (Vrsovice) in the south. The distance between the two southern mouths and the knowledge from Munich that every crossrail will become a victim of its own success as they'll build a second one parallel to the first one with fewer stops made the Czechs avoid taking chances. What I'm missing here is a stop at Albertov that I've seen in earlier drafts between Opera and NBS to access Charles University and the many tram lines in the valley between I. P. Pavlova and Vysehrad, especially how NBS lies on the way to Hostivar and that place features a big student dormitory. You see how the tunnels are supposed to bypass the overground bottlenecks and take all the outer arteries with them. If this is finished, they can raze Masarykova for good. You also see how every metro line finds an interchange to this scheme. And if you read my early chapters, you know that I'd definitely recommend the Czechs to choose the crossing scheme and not the tangential scheme. People expect a line to connect opposite ends.\n\nCommonalities with Belgrade:\n\nThe whole node is considered to be a mess to be fixed.\n\nThe central terminal is a necessary evil to be overcome and alternatively developed.\n\nTunnels to be built are the way to overcome the central terminal.\n\nDifferences to Belgrade:\n\nThere is no new central railway station to be built. Praha hl. n. already was a run-through railway station.\n\nThe central terminal is to be replaced with the crossrail tunnels instead of a new station even if the Belgrade tunnels also have crossrail functions. This is however similar to the fate of Potsdam Station in Berlin after the opening of the North-South tunnel, it was just the suburban sister to Anhalt Station.\n\nBelgrad had the new railway station and crossrail stations in mind when planning its future metro system. Prague has to take its existing metro network into consideration when planning its crossrails.\n\nThe question of through-routing intercity passenger traffic is separate from urban-suburban crossrail solutions.\n\nVIENNA\n\nThe Austrian capital's bid to consolidate intercity travel in one through-running station got new fuel when the fall of the Iron Curtain relieved it from its artificial borderland situation and brought it back to the center of Europe. Northwest Station is a cargo terminal whereas North Station was demolished and the closest thing to a successor is Wien Praterstern, a station where the Northern Main Line and the Connection Line unite to form Vienna's crossrail. Actual intercity traffic from Northern Main Line has ever since used an eastern bypass to arrive at the eastern terminal of South Station.\n\nSouth Station was actually two termini with a united station building, the eastern section that housed the Eastern Main Line (and the Northern via said bypass) and the western section that housed the Southern Main Line. Both rail lines make for the edges of the 10th borough of Vienna, called Favoriten being the most populous borough of Vienna and arose as a typical working-class district. So it was easy to see that South Station developed into the natural site for a future consolidated central railway station for Vienna.\n\nThen there's been West Station which housed the Western Main Line and was the natural end point of most intercity connections as Vienna is the easternmost German-speaking city since 1945/50 and of course the easternmost city of Danubian Austria. Said Western Main Line didn't have a powerful connection to South Station as the Southern Main Line had via Wien Meidling. This was a problem to be addressed for creating a central railway station.\n\nWhy leave that many words when you can see for yourself?​\n\nSo the earliest 21st century saw the construction of the new railway station at the site of the diagonally situated freight yard of South Station that already connect the Southern and Eastern lines as desired. The only tunnel to be built was the Lainzer Tunnel under the wildlife reserve park in westernmost Vienna that made for a direct connection of the Western Main Line to Wien Meidling and therefore to the new Vienna Main Station. Similar to Beograd Centar, Wien Hauptbahnhof was opened in phases, starting in 2012 and completed by 2014. One regional benefit of through-routing is the fact that Vienna Airport in the eastern suburb of Schwechat can feature direct railway connections beyond central Vienna.\n\nWest Station hasn't been closed, however; it's rather turned into the major regional rail hub for Lower Austria where Vienna lies in its very east. Property development has been done nonetheless to compensate for the loss of passengers and adjacent local demand for business. As the old South Station was a bit off from the new main station, they're actually one crossrail station apart and places changed names with subsequent development. The site of former South Station is now called \"Quartier Belvedere\" with its S-Bahn station consequently renamed and the new main station was built upon Southern Tyrol Square which already had an S-Bahn station also. The old name is still shown in brackets next to the designation \"Wien Hauptbahnhof\".\n\nCommonalities with Belgrade:\n\nThe consolidation of railway services into one new railway station.\n\nThe whole project was a ramification of a changed political geography.\n\nDifferences to Belgrade:\n\nBeograd-Glavna already was a consolidated central railway station, only its cul-de-sac nature was a problem.\n\nVienna West Station wasn't razed for property development which happened anyway.\n\nThree out of four directions were already accessible, only due west needed a new tunnel.\n\nThe site of Vienna Main Station has already been used for railway purposes and wasn't exactly new, just a bit off of South Station. Prokop was a cul-de-sac by nature and was the best way to handle an awkward situation due to its awkward nature.\n\nBERLIN\n\nBerlin's central railway station was opened in due time for the World Cup in Germany 2006. The idea dated back to World War I when the city yet had several termini that this station was to replace. Those termini were closed in the early 1950s, the divided city had factual main stations at Zoo (West) and Lichtenberg (East). Berlin was a broken shell of itself after the end of the Iron Curtain and this offered an opportunity to fix things from scratch because there wasn't exactly a running system to disturb.\n\nThe site of Lehrter Bahnhof where the future Berlin Hauptbahnhof was built was not far from the later Reichstag and especially a jail which became the JVA Moabit and was considered to be in the middle of nowhere even by contemporaries of the 19th century. Yet it was smack dab in the middle of the city of Berlin. The east-west overground crossrail \"Stadtbahn\" opened in 1882 was built to ease transfer between termini, so it comes to no surprise that Lehrter Bahnhof was adjacent to it also. This also eased the idea to build a double-decker station to replace them all.\n\nNo, they weren't on drugs. That's really called the Mushroom Concept.​\n\nSo the 1990s and early 2000s saw the construction of some north-south running underground arteries under the Tiergarten near the Reichstag: A stretch of subway called U55, a road tunnel to rebuild the B96 in Berlin and a railway tunnel to complement the Stadtbahn at the site of the future central railway station. It's grand opening came together with other new intercity station at the way such as the northern Gesundbrunnen and the Southern Cross both crossing the Ciricle Line. East Station was retained, but not Zoo Station which is still used regionally and by private intercity providers. Zoo Station already had a grown accessibility that the new station lacked. It's also speculated that forcing people to transfer away from Zoo Station was a way to promote business for the leaseholding shops inside the new central station. Accessing Berlin Hauptbahnhof is cumbersome. Closing the U5 gap will take until 2020, the tramway has been extended at the station's footsteps, the second north-south crossrail only recently saw the start of its construction. On the other hand, the construction site of the station itself bothered nobody as it was in nobody's way. So?\n\nCommonalities with Belgrade:\n\nThe whole project was a ramification of a changed political geography and it changed a lot of times in Berlin's 20th century.\n\nMost intercity trains terminate beyond Berlin Hauptbahnhof and therefore access bigger parts of the city directly, though the location depends on where they come from. In Belgrade, the two intercity stations Novi Beograd and Beograd Centar (Prokop) on both sides of the Save River make for a systematic tandem.\n\nProkop is also \"a bit off the heartbeat\" despite its nominally central location. It's got a reputation as a celebrity neighborhood with all the hills around the valley. Unlike the Berlin station, Prokop has the potential to turn the place into a vibrant South Side of Belgrade. And of course, the development hell of a railway station didn't bother anybody in both cities. This would've been different if Berlin's new main station would've been built at e.g. Berlin Friedrichstraße. On the other hand, local public transport needs to catch up in both examples.\n\nBerlin has an iconic underground mainline railway station besides the usual intercity station. Potsdamer Platz has a cube-shaped entry hall that hides a regional rail stop at the north-south link that also serves Berlin Hauptbahnhof besides accessing the S-Bahn. Preparations for a phantom U-Bahn line (U10/U3) were also done when tearing apart Potsdamer Platz whereas the legacy U-Bahn (U2) has to do without \"cube\" access. Belgrade has Vukov Spomenik in the northeast of Old Belgrade that works as the infrastructural brain of the Beovoz or BG:voz network and was built with cathedral-style Soviet metro stations in mind.\n\nDifferences to Belgrade:\n\nReunited Berlin could build upon legacy structures that just went dormant for half a century for geopolitical reasons to create a better version of its former grid. In Yugoslavia, it's taken almost half a century of active planning and construction while actively surviving new geopolitical obstacles to overcome a dysfunctional network conceived by even older geopolitical legacy issues.\n\nHugely popular Berlin Zoo Station has been downgraded from an intercity station to a regional rail station by German Railways after Berlin Hauptbahnhof went online. Call it leading the horse to the water, this was quite unpopular. Prokop may be the only station to be served by every train serving Belgrade, but Novi Beograd works as the factual transit hub of Belgrade and giving up its intercity station status entirely would be logistical nightmare.\n\nLEIPZIG\n\nThe east-central German metropole has built a north-south crossrail under Central Station and what used to be Bavarian Station. There are five stations at the trunk line: Main Station, Market Square, W. L. Square, Bavarian Station and MDR. Main Station is long enough to fit in a bullet train and has the option to be enlargered to a maximum of 800 meters. It's usually a crossrail which can double as a simple intercity station if need arises.\n\nThe development hell lastet from 1913 to 2013. The initial idea was having a small underground rail under the eastern ring between Main and Bavarian station via August Square. World War I halted construction and World War II prevented a continuation, some bombs fell into the tunnel, killed people and tore it into three pieces, one of them used as a cinema in the GDR and now demolished. 1946 plans called for two tunnels, the much later realised crossrail and an intercity tunnel for Berlin-Munich journey that was cancelled due to the Cold War. Construction happened 2003-2013 with Western money and stayed under budget with €935m instead of €960m.\n\nCommonalities with Belgrade:\n\nIt's an extreme example of making up for lost time.\n\nDifferences with Belgrade:\n\nThe realized scheme is an almost humble iteration of initially bigger plans. Well, at least you could run an ICE train underground through Leipzig if need really arose.\n\nSTUTTGART\n\nOh yeah, Stuttgart. My beloved state capital. I remember how I started a thread about it. In a nutshell, somebody came up with the idea to construct a bullet train line along the A8 motorway between Ulm and Stuttgart. This evolved into Stutgart 21 which is currently under construction: Replacing the cul-de-sac terminal with an underground east-west through-running main station that will also need further tunnels to go online and will also feature an ICE station for the airport and the fairground. Removing the legacy terminal tracks allows for recreating walkable greenfields and the construction of mixed-income housing which is why Stuttgart 21 also features a northern extension of the city's crossrail with a new stop called Midnight Street. The new underground railway station needs room from a legacy LRT tunnel, so an ersatz tunnel has to be built before the old one gets torn apart. Similar ideas for Frankfurt and Munich have been shelved indefinitely.\n\nCommonalities with Belgrade:\n\nTwo big tunnels are built to access a new railway station.\n\nThe inner city of Stuttgart is also situated in a climatically unauspicious valley-hill site just like Beograd Prokop. When it gets warm, it gets really warm and fresh air becomes a problem. There have also been riotous \"Parkschützer\" (park protectors) that demonstrated against chopping trees in the city park to make way for the reformed railway station. There's a very old bypass railway in the northeastern borough of Bad Cannstatt which is actually older than the proper city of Stuttgart. Night trains from Karlsruhe to Munich will drop you at the suburbs of Ludwigsburg and Plochingen, but not Stuttgart proper.\n\nDifferences with Belgrade:\n\nThe new railway station is also underground in contrast to Prokop.\n\nStuttgart had only one intercity station to begin with and the site of the new one will be the same.\n\nRE-IMAGINING LOCALES FOR YOUR ALTERNATE TIMELINES\n\nImagining London Underground in Max Sinister's Chaos TL for my fanfiction Samowar In Atlantis (aka MY BIGGEST FAILURE)\n\nIf you read my infamous Samowar In Atlantis fanfic based on the Chaos TL, you may have read how I imagined 2000 London Olympic Games after the 1996 Fort Knox ones. Well, this was supposed to be a trailer for another chapter that I failed to conceive. I wanted to reimagine the London Underground along the lines of Socialist path dependies and combining this stuff with technological prowess that IOTL is yet to come in the 21st century. I imagined how London in Socialist Britain would've had a very Soviet-style metro system, like being deep underground to work out as a nuclear fallout shelter and having that triangular interchange layout for maximum efficiency in its inception. I also thought about incorporating an idea that IOTL came from a Catalonian student in the late 2000s: An escalator where three stair steps could be leveled to one for a wheelchair on demand. There were a lot of problems that made me give up on all that.\n\nFirst of all, I realized that London had the ideal soil for digging tunnels and that the core network in OTL, though private ventures followed for-profit logic that a Socialist system wouldn't abide to, would've become pretty much the same as in any timeline. Second, even a cash-starved Socialist Britain would've head its underground before instant sunshine was invented, so there wouldn't have been any concentrated efforts to dig extra-deep fallout-proof underground tunnels from scratch.\n\nThird, London would still be so big that there isn't just one center to build an interchange triangle around. The City of London would've been dethroned for Socialism, is the House of Tomorrow supposed to be in Islington which IOTL belongs to the earliest studied examples of gentrification, a proud worker neighbourhood turning yuppie? Why not the Docklands? And why should the German Logo (hacker) Topper return to London after the Streich? Just for exposition to show how pushing a button makes a London Underground escalator a disabled-friendly transport? Who's he supposed to show? Björn is bound with MBA studies in Atlantis and going to the Chiemsee for a total eclipse and having Natascha's piece of ass once more is enough of a distraction from his studies. But two weeks for Olympic Games in England? And how far would he come with his German? They know French and Italian better than German.\n\nFourth, even without the Catalonian concept of push-the-button-ADA-accessible escalator, the Londonist on Youtube showed e.g. how a so-called inclinator makes a great 45-degree lift and is perfect for retrofitting existing stairways for wheelchair-accessibility. And as I found, the Prague Metro station Strašnická (opened 1987 in Communist Czechoslovakia) also features a relatively low-tech open-cabin inclinator of some sort at one point. I realized that I couldn't create a cold-war-punk version of London Underground for everybody after the Streich to show just for the hell of it. It's like extreme graphics are supposed to be the future, but they aren't. Damn. And so I quit.\n\nFeatures of typical big European post-Communist cities\n\n1. Poverty is the best conservator: Streetcars/tramways\n\nIn the West, it's like every family could afford a car. Not so in the East and the underperforming economy in Socialism with the subsequently slim public coffers also meant you couldn't do everything your Western counterparts did as well, even if so desired. That's the major reason why virtually all towns and cities that already had tram tracks retained them in East Germany [1] whereas the rest of the East Block retained them in the bigger cities at least. The construction binges in the West were way too costly for the East and the limited private wealth also meant that streetcars were the most economic way to access new quarters. There was already a network to start with, steel wheels are more robust than tires and electricity is the secondary form of energy that could be converted from anything. Just like high-speed rail works out most at distances \"too far to drive, too close to fly\", tramways work best at that sweet spot of capacities where busses get inefficient and rapid transit yet isn't worth it. Retaining the streetcars also eased the biggest drawback of Soviet-style metros: Long ways between the surface and underground with the escalator and longer distances between the stations.\n\n[1] Being the definite battlefont in World War III where everything with rubber tires moves to the front does this to you.\n\n2. Explaining the logic behind the Soviet triangle\n\nThis is a question somebody asked at skyscrapercity.com and which took me to that board in the first place. The most comprehensive answer was this: Most new quarters were new high-rise buildings at the edges of the city which produced the necessary numbers of passengers along the desired routes in the first place. The triangle is little more than an improved hub-and-spoke system that unweaves the jam of interchanging passengers from the start. Two metro lines make for one interchange, three lines handily make for three interchanges, yet four will already make for six and things will start to get complicated. It's a great system to copy and paste into lots of untouched cities that need to build their systems from scratch.\n\nTriangles have also been employed outside of the former Second World. The modern iterations of the Athens and Rome systems come into mind and the simplistic design for effectively piercing the inner city for the best effect is especially attractive if a city has millennia of archeological history under it soil. Munich downgraded from originally four planned lines to three triangular lines with bifurcations (U1 to U6) and also features additional servcies that connect trunk lines to outer stretches of alien trunk lines (U7, U8) and a new trunk line, the U9 bypass, has been planned to connect the outer edges of U3 and U6 directly with Main Station.\n\n3. What to keep in mind for your alternate timelines\n\nIf you want to design a subway system for communist cities in an ATL, imagine the history of the city before the regime change and how it may have plausibly evolved. Don't plaster the whole place with Soviet triangles, especially if a legacy of a pre-Communist system is entirely plausible and even probable. Geography will always remain the #1 obstacle to any urban planning under any ideological auspicses. Virtually every interchange contour and especially the Soviet triangles got placed at one bank of the its major river where its traditional center sits (Kharkiv in Ukraine has two of its three lines end in the triangle, mind you). Communism in Sweden won't change the geography of Stockholm as a city of islands where stacking two tubes over one another at the same strait made the most sense. Especially the Nordic social democracies with their small populations have rather small capital cities under 1 million denizens and have rather streamlined metro systems. The closest thing to an inner city ring or triangle in Stockholm was created at the northernmost shore with the most continuous hinterland. Oslo converted its stub-end western and eastern tramway and suburban rail systems into metro systems before converging them into one trunk line that eventually turned into a circle line. Copenhagen was fine with its S-tog for the entire 20th century and only the construction of Ørestad made it create a yet nascent-feeling network. Helsinki has similar shore issues as Stockholm and has one east-west line trespassing various waters.\n\nLiving Off The Substance: The OTL Case of Former East Berlin\n\nA good example for a city inheriting a legacy network into the forces of real socialism or equally ideologically motivated inefficiency would be OTL East Berlin where a very grown rapid transit system was cut in half and the traditional center was at the edge and like the handle of a fan. Unlike all other European satellite states whose capitals only started building systems in the Cold War (I also count in Budapest in here because its original Földalatti hardly meshes with its modern sisters) and therefore had to make up for a lot of lost time, the East Berlin network grew very slowly. Most new rapid transit lines were S-Bahn lines where an extra set of double track was laid next to the existing legacy railway line and got third rail electrification and the sites of the new satellite cities were purposefully placed along those railways. It also helped extremely that an outer railway ring had already been in place to circumvent West Berlin and legacy railways in direction east were often abandoned as their intended destinations now belonged to Poland. Even line E, the modern U5, only saw a one-stop underground extension to Tierpark after which it directly runs overground as line E served as an ersatz trunk line where the east-west trunk line would've been overburdened. Said outer railway ring was also supposed to get additional S-Bahn tracks as a makeshift solution to expand capacity without building a prohibitively expensive inner-city tunnel, but then the Cold War was over and the ghost lines under Berlin-Mitte became accessible again. The makeshift solution hasn't been completely forgotten by modern Berlin however and the city is growing richer and more populous again.\n\nLikewise the ends of lines C and D in West Berlin (and transiting through East Berlin borough of Mitte) needed a proper connection to City West around Zoologischer Garten and Kurfürstendamm (Ku'damm for short) to create a consolidated large-profile U-Bahn network on West Berlin territory independent from the East. This was done by creating the north-south-running U9 completely from scratch and creating the east-west-running U7 out of the southeastern Neukölln branch of line C. The full extent of line U7 ran suspiciously in parallel to major S-Bahn lines (run by the GDR in West Berlin also and boycotted due to the Berlin Wall), so were the northern U8 extensions and also a line U10 whose construction was cancelled after the handover of the Western S-Bahn to West Berln constituted a frustration of its mere purpose.\n\nCase Study: The Quasi-Mirror Europe of the Chaos TL\n\nA good case study would be, once again, Max Sinister's Chaos Timeline whose ATL communist/socialist countries don't show any geographical congruence with the OTL Second World. The British Isles turned red in the 1840s and Max Sinister followed original Marxist theory that the most developed country would have to become the first communist country as well and therefore London would've had to become the very first constructor of rapid transit worldwide and still pay dearly for adopting and especially developing the model for everyone else. And London is so big and has such a perfect soil for underground construction that you cannot just plaster a Soviet triangle onto it. A city like Rome that would've been the capital of the New Roman Empire would've surely built an own rapid transit system in the 50 to 100 years before Italy turned red, though it still inherits the problem of its ancient soil full of archeological gems.\n\nParis could've had a system in place before World War I because the Emperors were so generous *irony.exe off* and technology is decades more advanced than IOTL, but I guess it's more difficult in Iberia where local kings were fighting for dominance after the end of the New Roman Empire before getting swallowed by the Socialist Block. I can imagine them being a bit like OTL Budapest, with some legacy lines accompagnied with modern cookie-cutter triangles. And who says that Socalist Iberia in the Chaos TL would only see subways in Lisbon, Madrid and Barcelona? Note that the OTL systems in Madrid and Barcelona were already inaugurated in 1919 and 1924 respectively and appear quite massive whereas Lisbon had to wait until 1959. Greece as a backwater ITTL as well as IOTL with its archeological richness could've fared quite similar to OTL. The Northern European systems with the possible exception of Hamburg would've been quite young by comparison and they've also been built only after World War II IOTL. It might be tempting to plaster them with triangles, but their general proximity to the sea (city center at the shore, high ground water levels) and their rather low populations gave way to some peculiarities IOTL and this won't change ITTL. The biggest obstacle may actually be re-envisioning how the street grids look like, especially the further in the past the POD is. In this world we live in, London had some notable fires in the Early Modern Age and Old Paris was leveled around 1850 to make way for the modern street grid designed by Baron Haussmann.\n\nAnd OTL shows that there's still variation among the Central and Eastern European countries. The two lines of Sofia Metro are actually one physical rail corridor reminiscent of an HIV awareness bow split in the middle of the loop and the third line is yet to be built. Bucharest Metro started out as a circle lines (M1) that the straight east-west line M2 descended from. Line M3 crosses line M2 classically whereas M4 only touches the circle M1. Only a line M5 may one day form the perfect Soviet triangle. Prague Metro was the only textbook example of a triangle to be completed during the Cold War. Budapest in disregard of its millennium subway is also a perfect triangle that may one day even take it to the next level like Saint Peterburg. Warsaw Metro started with plans for only two lines to begin with. East of the Vistula, line M2 shall get a bifurcation that shall one day grow into a Line 3 that shall also grow back into left-bank Warsaw, crossing M1 at a new Constitutional Square station between far-spaced Centrum (M1/M2) and Politechnika (M1) stations. This would be a very elongated triangle and bears no resemblance to classical Soviet designs.\n\nOTL Moscow could draw from experience of established systems to avoid many mistakes. War booties from Berlin U-Bahn could easily run in the Moscow system with minor conversions (750 V DC in Berlin, 825 V DC in the Soviet Union) because it's been modeled after the Berlin system. Its platforms are built to prevent One Unders from the start and for good. It also debuted the triangular system with Teatralna station having three levels at two corners at the short edge inbetween.\n\nFrom East to West: Welcome To Modern Berlin\n\nThe formerly divided city still features two hearts beating in its chest. 40 years of divergence in urban planning won't just vanish over night. Until LEDs will have replaced them all, the differences in street lights in former West and East Berlin will make the two former halves look distinct enough in the night from space. There's also public transit coming to mind.\n\nWest Berlin was especially distinct as Western money from the FRG allowed it to tear down its tramway network and generously expand the U-Bahn network, especially vis-à-vis the (Eastern-run) S-Bahn that's been boycotted since the construction of the Berlin Wall. U9 and U7 were built and extended to create a consolidated network inside West Berlin that made other extensions only viable in the first place. The northern stub of U8 was extended to access Märkisches Viertel projects in blissful ignorance of the existing S-Bahn and the earlier U6 extensions were masterminded long before division.\n\nEast Berlin couldn't axe the tramway in the same way (it got away from Friedrichstraße and Alexanderplatz, however) and even expanded it to access new high-rise housing projects, often building them in proximity to existing railways that provided an easy way to turn it into an S-Bahn line (Ahrensfelde, Wartenberg). Hellersdorf would've overburned the S-Bahn system which resulted in the overground expansion of the otherwise underground line E (now U5) beyond the Outer Berlin Railway Ring. The next projects to be built by 2000, if the GDR had survived, would've been in Malchow which is just beyond Ahrensfelde at the Outer Berlin Railway Ring.\n\nBy the time the Cold War ended, you had a West Berlin full of U-Bahn and BRT lines on the one hand and an East Berlin full of tramways on the other hand. There's a reason why two specific ghost stations along U8 were re-opened as border checkpoints: Jannowitzbrücke was easy to access by S-Bahn, but Rosenthaler Platz was easy to access by tramway. The U-Bahn was and is definitely the best way to get to West Berlin. And also to get out: When I attended a meetup in 2010 near Mehringdamm station (U6/U7) in Kreuzberg and lodged in a hostel in Mitte, it felt way more easy to take the tram from Oranienburg Street (S) to Oranienburg Gate (U) and directly get to Kreuzberg than going directly underground and change at Friedrichstraße.\n\nExpanding the tramway into the West hardly happened. If you remember how the \"party tram\" M10 goes from, western but still east-proximate, Hauptbahnhof to Warschauer Straße in a half-circle, there's a strong case for extending it over the Spree River to Neukölln in former West Berlin at Hermannsplatz, U-Bahn interchange of U7 and U8 and former home of a cathedral-like Karstadt mall that the SS self-destructed in order to deny the incoming Red Army a food temple. Two subway lines cross here, but they won't cross the nearby river which requires an interchange at Kottbusser Tor to finally make landfall in Warschauer Straße which needn't be your final destination after all. An M10 extension would cut one or two interchanges in this relation and get you directly to e.g. Frankfurter Allee with its U5 which will likely never see an extension of U1 from Warschauer Straße to create an interchange, especially as an extension to Ostkreuz is preferable for multiple reasons.\n\nThat's the central southeast I've been talking about. Let's talk about the northwest instead. The extension from Hauptbahnhof to Turmstraße in planning is sometimes criticized to be a bad substitute for a more effective, but also more costly, U-Bahn extension beyond Hauptbahnhof to the U9 at Turmstraße. The promised land is actually even further northwest. Though Berlin won't like insular networks, Spandau makes a compelling case for just that. And once it's been built, you could organically mesh with the remainder of the Berlin network via Siemensstadt (where a dormant S-Bahn begs to be re-activated ever since Siemens announced to build a technological park in its birthplace) and what will become of Airport Tegel once it's been closed for BER. Stuff like Hermannsplatz and Turmstraße are just extensions to create checkpoints for the tramway in former West Berlin. Extending the M4 tramway in a southwestern fashion to mimick original U10 plans is charming, but stuff like the Spandau proposals are the only real deal for tram reconquista.\n\nFeatures of typical big Western European cities\n\nThe capitalist cities in Western Europe did have the money for the complete automotive frenzy en vogue after the war. In order to showcase the differences between East and West, a specific example in the East comes in handy.\n\nWhat if Leipzig had stayed a Western city?\n\nThe transit system would look decidedly different from today. The scarcities of Socialism limited the automotive frenzy with the separation of the driving public and the vulnerable road users. Limited, not prevented. If you look at this quintessential example of a medium-sized big city (5-600,000 denizens) that used to be a somewhat important city of the Reich (long tradition as an exhibition site or even Reichsmessestadt, most important fair of the GDR in East-West relations, kickstarted the Monday Demonstrations against the Honecker regime), you may take a guess how similar cities in Western Europe would've developed under Socialism.\n\nPost-transformation Friedrich Engels Square (now Richard Wagner Square), northwestern Inner City Ring of Leipzig in 1973 from a pedestrian perspective\n\nSame place from an automotive perspective​\n\nOverground is always cheaper than underground. It's no miracle that Communists generously plastered cities with high-level pedestrian bridges and often also viaducts for highways as it's been easy to construct. The shown pedestrian bridge in Leipzig was actually demolished in the early 21st century. Examples for viaduct highways whose destruction was discussed but rejected for the moment are in neighboring Halle (an der Saale) and in Prague as the North-South Connection, former West German Ludwigshafen on the other hand decided to demolish its \"high street\" for a tunnel instead. Typically Eastern however is how the classic streetcar network stayed classic and especially entirely overground and this is true for the entire Second World. Similar cities in West Germany however turned their tramways into LRT networks with underground tunnels in the inner cities. They definitely feel like subway stations and have proper interchange levels.\n\nStuttgart has two big bi-level interchange stations at Charlotte Square and Main Station where the Valley Lines and Cross-Valley Lines meet. Cologne never had a master plan, it lacked a powerful north-south inner-city connection at the left bank of the Rhein River even before the war destroyed the streetcar network (now in underground construction and jerry-building paired with criminal energy led to the implosion of the Cologne City Archive) and its central railway station used to merely feature a stub of a streetcar line before automotive transformation.\n\nIt's not the only way to do it, but it's most examplary.​\n\nA completely different animal was Hannover, however. Hannover is like an echo to Leipzig, especially as the Cold War and Leipzig being in the Soviet zone and later the GDR meant that the biggest fairground in the world has been built in Hannover to make up for loss of Leipzig. It was also the home to the computer fair CEBIT before it's been cancelled after this year's fair. Here it's been even worse than in Stuttgart, best seen in the fact that the B tunnel straddles along parts of the A and C tunnels and there's one big-ass interchange station for all three tunnels at Kröpcke. Hannover is solid flat land unlike Stockholm, but congestions really was and is that bad. The D tunnel hasn't been materialized and would only serve two lines (10, 17) and the current Red-Green city council actually transforms the legacy overground D line to become ADA accessible at this moment and there's contentious debate how sensible the whole thing is.\n\nLeipzig has a different urban geography with a track-free historic centre embedded inside a ring road where all tram lines converge. Removing tram tracks from big central plazas to turn them into big pedestrian zones has been done in both the East and the West, so it's safe to say that Leipzig Market Square without the auspisces of real socialism would've got rid of its streetcars just as quickly after the war and, as it's been realized in the 21st century IOTL, only got train access by the north-south crossrail that ITTL could've been built in the 1960s and 1970s just as in most important West German big cities. If you look back at the start of this thread, you'll find the colorful spaghetti bowl of Leipzig tramway. Each of those colors could've gotten its own ring road tunnel trunk line with a comparably beautiful mess of a scheme along its ring road as the existing one in Hannover IOTL. The tracks in the western part of the ring road could've suspiciously remained overground as it's just of peripheral congestion. This is, of course, a Wirtschaftswunder scenario for Leipzig. Post-material societies like the real present one prefer low-floor vehicles on a classical streetcar network.\n\nThe Billion People Nation Equivalent To The Soviet Triangle: Paired Cross-Platform Transfer\n\nThe proliferation of an institution comes with redesigns and other improvements that will hardly be retrofitted into pioneer systems. Moscow-descended systems are a poster child, of course, but there are other instances as well. Cross-platform interchange stations exist in numerous metro systems in order to ease transfer. The problem is that any platform can only handle half of all directions. It's usually clear that most people go for one rough direction at rush hour, but Chinese cities found it to be a missed opportunity in some cases not to offer this convenient way of interchange into all directions.\n\nThe biggest question is, of course, how you get people to leave the train at the right platform. The answer is that those are two separate stations. Then you can say leave for the other line here for direction X and skip this stop for the station right next in order to change for direction Y. The first adopter was the formerly British Crown colony Hongkong which designed Mong Kok and Prince Edward station in just that manner to allow for this elegant form of interchange into all direction. It shouldn't be a surprise that the second adopter of this design was the capital of Taiwan before Mainland China became the third adopter in Wuhan whose metro system is the umpteenth in the People's Republic.\n\nIn the upper right, we see how there's one \"antagonistic\" cross-platform interchange station for two classical directional ones. In this case, passengers that need to change in the inconvenient direction may decide if they want to walk upstairs and downstairs or if they want to change the train twice. Tourists wouldn't put up with this brain yoga, but regular commuters would have to.\n\nI remember an illustration of the four tunnels that unweave the mess of Camden Town at the Northern Line in all four relations. One station has to be antagonistic as I said, so it's nice to see that they took the one-level one to be directional.\n\nThe thing is this: Only really populous countries have enough million-denizen cities to proliferate a role model like that and improve it, IOTL starting with the Soviet Union and continuing here with China and one day maybe with India. As this post at our urban planning and transit thread shows, path dependencies die hard at least inside a language community. That post also illustrates how the typical American street grid allowed for 4-track subways in New York City and how Paris left its inprint in Montreal.\n\nThe Answer To All Other Questions: Latin American BRT Systems\n\nSeveral cities in Latin America and elsewhere employ a hierarchical busway system where express lines fit the role of tramways and subways in other cities. It's easier and cheaper to establish, especially if it's badly needed.\n\nCuritiba has like ten different types of bus services whereas Bogota has like five. Curitiba had the luxury to be able to plan its growth before it came, the Bogota system streamlined a lot of formerly chaotic private relations. In a reverse situation to New York City where private minibus systems survived the end of a subway driver strike which created it in the first place (mostly ethnic), private minibusses still run in parallel to this public transit system. Those exemplary hierarchical systems tell you all about any public transit system in the world.\n\nHierarchy is indeed anything. There may be places where busses may suffice, but you can also have bendy buses and minibuses as further differentiation. You need trunk lines that satisfy the need for speed and capacity just as smaller modes of transport that ensure the accessibility of the entire community and this can come in many variations.\n\nA BRT system shows that the city actually needs a prime urban rail system, but can't afford its realization. And it will definitely not constitute the entirety of a city's bus fleet. One example would be Berlin whose West used to raze its streetcar network: The M lines started out as double-decker bus lines (Metrobus) and the principle was later expanded to the tramway (Metrotram) and were specifically designed to serve relations where rapid transit is lacking but needed.\n\nA designated LRT system is intended to be the backbone of a transit system. Therefore you'll have bigger gaps between stations to increase speed and capacity. The backbone of the Valley Lines in Stuttgart that bifurcates at many centrally located stations runs in parallel to the central crossrail of the S-Bahn with comparable distances between their most central stations and many bifurcations cross the crossrail at specific station you've got to remember. The Cross-Valley Lines don't just cross the Valley Lines at Charlotte Square, but also the crossrail and several LRT lines at Main Station. If I really need to get home via Main Station (instead of doing P+R in Stuttgart and environs), I sometimes ride out to Marienplatz (great record store nearby) to take the line 10 (a cog railway) to Degerloch because I know that all Cross-Valley Lines (save for a tangential line each in the north and south) cross the two designated stations I already mentioned.\n\nA city with both a rapid transit system and a tramway network won't have anything inbetween. Vienna converted its age-old LRT system to fit into its nascent rapid transit system and both did and still do exist side by side to the classical tramway network. The citizens of Zurich canton rejected both an LRT system in the 1960s and a subway system in the 1970s. The crossrail system (S-Bahn) was however approved and makes for the backbones whereas the tramway provides for the ample dispersion inside the city.\n\nRetrofitting (Part II-2) - Upgrading and Consolidating: Utilities and Home Improvement\n\nWhat hasn't already been put in there in the first place won't be installed for decades to come. That's rule number one for any builder out there. The best example for this rule is the fact that overhauling Westminster would cost an estimated £20bn, require eight years of construction and especially a provisional relocation of Parliament. And example of a now-running overhaul of Parliament is the Austrian one in Vienna. All functions have been evacuated, the process goes from 2017 to 2021 and the MPs conduct their business in the Redoute Wing of the Hofburg. Some things can't be done as a patchwork as the systems to be renewed or replaced run through the entire building.\n\nThe early 21st century has also seen the replacement of water supply lines that were 150 years old in some places, especially London. The individual plots that will need an overhaul once a generation after all are a completely different matter. Check your water pipes and electricity for that matter, HVAC is the most underestimated point. How do you watch TV or get into the Internet for that matter? The most elegant solution would be through a socket in your wall, but this cannot be taken for granted in every room. Powerline is a way to easily extend a local area network where other options aren't handy, but legacy circuits in general are rather underengineered for modern demands and I can speak from personal experience.\n\nIn 1995/96, we had a hedonist C2DE couple as tenants at our ground floor flat that would've easily fit in at a rave or sensation with a lovely black-white cat. They moved out after a year and left us with a broken bath tub plughole and broken electricity. They sued us for the deposit and lost. The circuits from the 1950s in the living rooms were definitely not designed for the high watt numbers that a strong bass just requires. Mom and I occupied opposing bedrooms in the attic and she asked me if I was to blame for the noise. No, they came from \"those downstairs\" as we refered to our tenants. It was Friday at 11pm and that's when the \"Housefrau\" show at VIVA aired in my own childhood room. I was in 4th grade, by the way and whereas I wouldn't have considered myself a techhead back in the days, there just wasn't anything better on air at that moment and my taste in music wasn't that far away from it: Classmates gave me the second studio album by Ace of Base as a present for my 10th birthday. Oh, what the irony. That's why electricity is way better at ground floor than in the rest of the house, the installations are a whopping 40 years younger and designed to be more resilient. And what used to be my grandparents' bedroom never got an antenna socket as it was intended to be used a bedroom and what hasn't already been put in there... you know.\n\nHere we've got a prospect about a new housing project in my city which shows which stuff may be desirable nowadays and easy to implement if you build a house anew but will create headaches if you try to retrofit them. A plug to close off for your electric car to recharge at home, sure, that's the future. CAT 7 as the backbone for your local area network into every room of your house or apartment, sure. Homeplug adapters are the poster child of retrofitting solutions, but the less you need them, the better. Audiovisual fish eyes for your security? This goes way beyond Tool Time in the series universe of Home Improvement. They don't write if they've already got fibre to the home, I fear no, but they definitely should. And as an heir, I've also read that a fibre cable rather won't be built alone into a house, but more as one of 2x2 pipes: Electricity, water, natural gas and fibre. My front yard wouldn't survive an overhaul, that's for sure, because every floor will need an own garage. At least I'm in a city and my internet could be worse, which brings as to the next problem.\n\nInternet access is a disaster in quite a few first-world countries and many people don't even know it. America is a poster child in this regard, sure, but my native Germany also has its moments. I live in a city where you've got 50 Mbit/s for download and 10 Mbit/s for upload by the Deutsche Telekom, but get to the countryside and... well? Let's just say that a pal of mine recently returned from a trinational vacation (Japan, Thailand, Vietnam) and complains how the likes in Bulgaria (and also Albania for that matter) have much better 4G coverage than us where he, subjective at the least, feels more dead spots. I'd also that quite a few traditional first-world countries may actually have gotten complacent due to their old wealth and don't sense how they're at risk of missing out on access. Newly industrialized countries, however, see how these technologies help them catch up with the rest of the world. If people are supposed to stay or even move to the villages and kiss goodbye to skyrocketing urban housing prices, they need infrastructure that allows them to do so and this means high-speed internet right out of the air. Once in a while, I like to drive from home to Braunsbach that had to be rebuilt after a flooding in 2016 and whose coat of arms features to the proximate highest motorway bridge in Germany. I can only do emergency calls from Braunsbach, maybe it's because my mobile provider is o2, but it's definitely because compulsory roaming for all providers in a country are not yet a thing her and our government just didn't create the incentives or maybe the coersion to force high-speed mobile telephony and internet into the countryside. Braunsbach does have a new mom-and-pop shop, however, after it went through stretches of having no shopping at all.\n\nFurther watching: REICHSBAHN GOES UNDER BERLIN!\n\nLots of illustrations that make it amenable even if you don't know any German. Starts at 5 minutes in earnest. The mother of all underground crossrails also demanded a lot of new pipes out of the way to replace what could've worked for ages to come if not for the crossrail. That's actually one of the very first things to be done when using the cut-and-cover method. Cute to watch is how they still use horse buggies to get away with the crud.\n\nRetrofitting (Part II-2bis) - Upgrading and Consolidating: Devices\n\n2017 is the year when the last analog TV broadcasts, cable to be exact, have been switched off here in Germany and other European countries had comparable schedules. If you're a tech-unsavvy old widow who just cannot be bothered to ditch the quite easy way to watch TV over an analog CRT television and already had a problem to use a VCR, that's the time when people that \"actually wouldn't need all that stuff\" get all that stuff into their homes.\n\nLook at the features an average modern TV offers to you and compare it with the situation as it used to be maybe five or even ten years ago. And remember which features aren't there yet and still require a set-top box.\n\nTerrestrial television? Built-in tuners have been around for quite a while, but especially Europe experienced a switch from DVB-T to DVB-T2 and even though (or rather because) most terrestrial watchers don't count on it exclusively, it can feel like a rip-off especially because it's HD only and private stations can require money for watching them as long as their SDTV signal remains for free. And why bother with yet another box? That's a case where America is better as major national networks broadcast in HDTV for free (do they have too?), that definitely helps in cutting the cord where it's the most expensive in the world. The fact that major broadcaster did their digital broadcasts in HD only and that American politics forced the switch-off of analog TV in 2009/10 in order to assign their frequencies to police and firefighting forces definitely helped.\n\nCable television? We got analog cable in our house by 1991 and our CRT already had a tuner. Hardly anybody got themselves a special DVB-C set-top box, but parallel analog and digital tuning was there since flatscreens became prominent for everybody and their dog. Cable was also the first mode to offer triple play services in Germany (television, internet, VoIP telephony) which can now be accesed via landline also.\n\nSatellite television? Whether analog or digital, it was always complicated to operate more than one TV set with one dish. Sat over IP eased things a lot and I didn't believe it when I finally saw that a set in my own home actually had a built-in sat tuner.\n\nIPTV? That's still the new sexy thing in town, available yet not that common and receivers yet improve constantly for 4K and more that it will take some time until even a new smart TV instantly recognizes the channels on your router from your provider. Even if at the end of day, tuning in IPTV channels should be just as easy as with any other \"traditional\" mode. Which brings us to the next point in general.\n\nSmart television? Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast. Stuff like that should suffice to cater most of your web-based television needs. Yet it took until 2019 for the turf war between Amazon and Google to be ended to make this ideal a reality.\n\nA real smart TV is then handy if you really need to double a PC screen onto a big screen for everybody to watch, that's where sticks and dongles just don't come in handy enough. HbbTV is, of course, the better alternative to obsolete to teletext, but a TV only feels smart if the apps that you all cherish actually run on them. I have a non-smart HD television in my bedroom, a semi-smart HD television in my living room or rather office (HbbTV and media libraries, but hardly any apps) and a \"real\" smart UHD in my attic that I'd call a humble home cinema. Stuff like gaming consoles that improve with every generation won't ever become embedded and VR glasses are another form of output, so to speak."
