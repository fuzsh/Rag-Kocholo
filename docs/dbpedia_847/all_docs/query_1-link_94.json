        "text": "History\n\nThe U-Bahn station opened in 1910 with the original name HauptstraÃe after the section of the ReichsstraÃe 1 running through the districts of SchÃ¶neberg and Friedenau. It was renamed Innsbrucker Platz, after the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck, with the inauguration of the S-Bahn station in 1933. After the war the station was reopened in 1945. In the 1970s the entrance was changed a few times due to the construction of a tunnel in the course of the BAB 100 motorway (Stadtring).\n\nAfter the underground station had been badly damaged in the Second World War, but it was back into operation on 16 December 1945, the access to the station was completely rebuilt in 1954. The access on the central island was closed, instead a new entrance was created north of the square in the Innsbrucker StraÃe in a glazed pavilion in the typical style of the 1950s, which led directly to the platform via a staircase.\n\nThe construction of the Stadtautobahn 100, built as a city ring, which was led through a tunnel under the Innsbrucker Platz, made a further conversion necessary between 1971 and 1979. Between the road surface and the motorway tunnel, a large distribution floor was created, and the southern tunnel of the existing subway was separated. A further construction of the U4 to the south was thus no longer possible, and also the parking facility south of the Innsbrucker Platz could not be used. Since then, the tracks of the U4 end bluntly on the platform."
