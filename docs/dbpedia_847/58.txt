In this Thread I will be recommending 4 Berlin S-Bahn Lines for the North-South S-Bahn

I think these routes would be a great first Berlin route for TSW2.

I will be recommending 4 S-Bahn Routes but only one should be chosen to be made.

1. Route Info

1.1 S1

The S1 line operates between Oranienburg and Wannsee crossing the Berlin-Brandenburg border.

The S1 has a total of 35 stops streching over 51,7km. The drive from Oranienburg and Wannsee takes around 80 minutes. The S1 drives through the Nordbahn, Stettiner Bahn, Nord-Süd S-Bahn and the Wannseebahn.

The S1 stops at the following stations:

Oranienburg-Lehnitz-Borgsdorf-Birkenwerder-Hohen Neudorf-Frohnau-Hermsdorf-Waidmannslust-Wittenau-Wilhelmsruh-Schönholz-Wollankstraße-Bornholmer Straße-Gesundbrunnen-Humboldthain-Nordbahnhof-Oranienburger Straße-Friedrichstraße-Brandenburger Tor-Potsdamer Platz-Anhalter Bahnhof-Yorckstraße-Julius Leber Brücke-Schöneberg-Friedenau-Feuerbachstraße-Rathaus Steglitz-Botanischer Garten-Lichterfelde West-Sundgauer Straße-Zehlendorf-Mexikoplatz-Schlachtensee-Nikolassee-Wannsee

1.2 S2

The S2 line operates between Bernau and Blankenfelde crossing the Berlin-Brandenburg border twice.

The S2 has a total of 28 stops streching over 46,6km. The drive from Bernau and Blankenfelde takes around 70 minutes. The S2 drives through the Stettiner Bahn, Nord-Süd S-Bahn and the Dresdener Bahn.

The S2 stops at the following stations:

(Stations marked in Italic are in Brandenburg.)

1.3 S25+S26

The S25 line operates between Hennigsdorf and Teltow Stadt crossing the Berlin-Brandenburg border twice. The S25 has a total of 27 stops streching over 39,9km. The drive from Hennigsdorf to Teltow Stadt takes around 60 minutes. The S25 drives through the Kremmener Bahn, Nordbahn, Stettiner Bahn, Nord-Süd S-Bahn and the Anhalter Vorortbahn.

The S25 stops at the following stations:

Hennigsdorf-Heiligensee-Schulzendorf-Tegel-Eichborndamm-Karl Bonhoeffer Nervenklinik-Alt Reinickendorf-Schönholz-Wollankstraße-Bornholmer Straße-Gesundbrunnen-Humboldthain-Nordbahnhof-Oranienburger Straße-Friedrichstraße-Brandenburger Tor-Potsdamer Platz-Anhalter Bahnhof-Yorckstraße-Südkreuz-Priesterweg-Südende-Lankwitz-Lichterfelde Ost-Osdorfer Straße-Lichterfelde Süd-Teltow Stadt

(Stations marked in Italic are in Brandenburg.)

The S26 line operates between Waidmannslust and Teltow Stadt crossing the Berlin-Brandenburg border.

The S26 has a total of 23 stops streching over 30,4km. The drive from Waidmannslust to Teltow Stadt takes around 50 minutes. The S26 drives through the Nordbahn, Stettiner Bahn, Nord-Süd S-Bahn and the Anhalter Vorortbahn.

The S26 stops at the following stations:

Waidmannslust-Wittenau-Wilhelmsruh-Schönholz-Wollankstraße-Bornholmer Straße-Gesundbrunnen-Humboldthain-Nordbahnhof-Oranienburger Straße-Friedrichstraße-Brandenburger Tor-Potsdamer Platz-Anhalter Bahnhof-Yorckstraße-Südkreuz-Priesterweg-Südende-Lankwitz-Lichterfelde Ost-Osdorfer Straße-Lichterfelde Süd-Teltow Stadt

(Stations marked in Italic are in Brandenburg.)

The S25 and S26 would be counted as 1 route as they arent that different.

The Routes can be shortened if they are too long:

S1: Frohnau-Wansee+Potsdamer Platz-Zehlendorf

S2: Buch-Lichtenrade

S26: Potsdamer Platz-Teltow Stadt

2. Rolling Stock

The Rolling Stock would include the BR481/482 and 2(or 1) DLC trains the BR480 and the BR476/276

BR481/482

The BR481/482 was built between 1995-2004 and is one of the most used S-Bahns in Berlin and it is the 2nd Youngest S-Bahn after the BR483/484. The BR481/482 can go up to 80km/h and it is equipped with the ZBS system. It would be the perfect starter Train for this route.

BR480

The BR480 was built between 1986-1987 and 1990-1994 it was the main Train in the time of the division of Berlin. The BR480 can reach up to 100km/h and it isnt equipped with the ZBS system. Even though it doesent have ZBS I think it would be a great DLC Train.

BR476/276

Another historic Train is the BR476/276 it was built between 1979 and 1989. The 476/276 can reach up to 100km/h. The 476/276 also doesen't have ZBS but it would also be a great DLC Train.

3. Final Thoughts

I think one of these routes would be a perfect start to a Berlin in TSW2 as they are sort of like the Bakerloo Line as you go through a tunnel through the City Center. And these routes offer a great ride through one of the coolest cities in Germany, Berlin.

Let me know what you think or what your suggestions are!

The Train on the Picture you see is not ET476. It is only the ET477.
