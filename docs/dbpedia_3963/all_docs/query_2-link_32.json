        "text": "Christianity is the largest religion in the world. It is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nHow Many Christians are in the World Today?\n\nApproximately 2.38 billion people practice some form of Christianity globally. This means that about one-third of the world’s total population is Christian. Christianity has several denominations, but the largest is the Catholic Church. There are about 1.2 billion Catholics globally. Other large denominations include Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Most Christian Countries\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion in Europe, Russia, North America, South America, parts of Africa, Timor Leste, the Philippines, and much of Oceania. However, Christianity is also practiced on a smaller scale in regions including the Middle East and Indonesia. In some 21 nations worldwide, Christianity has been deemed the state religion. These nations include England, Greece, and Iceland. Nations with high numbers of Christians or members of any religion but no official state religion and where religion does not play a role in policymaking are secular countries.\n\nIn terms of how many Christians reside in a nation, the United States leads the pack with approximately 230 million. Brazil also has a high number of Christians – over 180 million, to be exact.\n\nCountries with the highest total number of Christians:\n\nIn terms of percentages of Christians compared to a nation’s population as a whole, the top spot is understandably claimed by Vatican City, the independent city state that is the headquarters of the Catholic Church. The Vatican's roughly 825 citizens are all Christian, which gives it a percentage of 100%. In second place is Timor Leste (formerly East Timor). Of this island nation's more than 1.1 million residents, approximately 99.1% are Christian. A full 98% of American' Samoa's 70,000 residents practice Christianity, but it's a U.S. territory rather than an independent country. Thus, third place falls to Romania, which is 98% Christian.\n\nCountries with the highest percentage of Christians:"
