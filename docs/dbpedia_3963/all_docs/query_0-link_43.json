        "text": "A Word From Our Executive Director\n\nI traveled to the Philippines for the writing process five months after typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, had made landfall in central Philippines. With WDP sisters, Prima Formilleza and Zenaida Maturan, we visited Tacloban. Corazon Reyes, Executive Secretary of the Fellowship of the Least Coin, contacted Josefina Evangelista, United Church of Christ Women’s President, who welcomed us.\n\nWe spent the trip listening to the stories of the day that Yolanda hit Tacloban. The sound of the strong winds, the prayers of the children, the ship stuck on the street, the cemetery at the Catholic Church yard for the community’s victims, the hunger, the resilience and the faith. In that context, there are many questions with no easy answers.\n\nThat is quite the same feeling when listening to the story Jesus told about the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 20:1-16. While Jesus sees no wrongdoing in giving generously, the workers who felt entitled to receive more, strongly complained. This dialogue was then turned into a question for the 2017 WDP theme - “Am I Being Unfair to You?”\n\nThe WDP Philippines Committee\n\nProtestant Christianity arrived in the Philippines during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. It was introduced by North-American missionaries during the American occupation. Wives of these missionaries introduced the World Day of Prayer in the Philippines. The celebrations brought together the church women leaders of the different Protestant denominations. In 1947, the United Evangelical Council of Church Women, today known as the Church Women United of the Philippines (CWUP), was organized. Its main activity was the observance of the World Day of Prayer. For the past 70 years, the CWUP coordinates the celebration of the World Day of Prayer in the Philippines through its WDP National Committee.\n\nWDP Philippines is composed of women representatives from nine women organizations of member churches of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines. These are: Episcopal Church Women, Federation of Baptist Women’s Missionary Unions, Inc., Kalipunan ng kababaihang UNIDA Ekyumenikal, Philippine Lutheran Women’s League, Salvation Army Women’s Ministries, National Christian Women’s Association of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Kapisanan ng mga Kababaihan ng IEMELIF, Women of the Philippine Independent Church, and United Methodist Women’s Society of Christian Service.\n\n​As we prepare for the worship, women and girls from the Philippines enter carrying symbols, each with a story. Rowena, after listening to the reflection of the WDP writing groups, tells the story of God’s economic justice in contrast to the economy of the strong and the powerful in her beautiful artwork.\n\n​God gave the Philippines abundant resources, both human and material. God is the great provider and provision is for all of creation. This is God’s display of economic justice in contrast to the economy where the strong and powerful take God’s resources for themselves and their families. The kingdom of God provides for all, even for those who do not acknowledge it.\n\nA Glimpse of the Philippine Situation\n\n​By: Rowena “Apol” Laxamana-Sta.Rosa​\n\n\"Oh children, I welcome you to the Philippines, called the Pearl of the Orient Seas...\"\n\nOur worship services are always inclusive towards children. We want them to begin learning, at a young age, about Jesus' love and how to share their love with others around the world.\n\nGather the children around and have a world map in an area for everyone to see. Ask the children to draw a line beginning from where they live and ending in the Philippines. Encourage them to imagine traveling towards the Philippines. And let them share how they feel about this travel.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n​Bible Study on the Workers in the Vineyard\n\n(Mt 20:1-16)\n\nBy: Ulrike Bechmann, Austria/Germany\n\nThis Bible Study was held at the YPray? - Conference of the WDP Committee of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (EWNI) at Northampton, 30th of April 2016. It is based on the main Bible text of the World Day of Prayer Service for 2017, written by women from the Philippines.\n\nWe thank Ulrike Bechmann and England, Wales and Northern Ireland Committee for offering this additional resource to World Day of Prayer annual celebration.\n\nClick here to download this Bible Study:\n\nBible Study on the Workers in the VineyardFile Size: 886 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\n©Text of the Bible Study: Ulrike Bechmann, Germany; Music: Siegfried Macht, Germany/Strube-Verlag, München; English text of the songs: Ulrike Bechmann, Germany.\n\n​To join WDP, to participate in the program, to learn the prayers, concerns and ways to be in solidarity with, please get in contact with your National Committee."
