        "text": "The spiritual life of upland Philippine groups has long involved the geography of the mountainous areas in which they live, which remains true today among some conservative Protestants. This article presents an example of a non-denominational Christian congregation in the northern Philippine city of Baguio. This form of Christianity, firmly woven into narratives of modernity, prohibits the sacralisation of physical place in a manner reflective of the traditional understandings of material agency. Instead, these contemporary Christians engage in the process Webb Keane (following Latour) has called ‘purification’, in which materiality and agency are discursively and conceptually drawn apart. I argue that the form of Christianity practised here allows for a re-inscription of the mountains with a Christian significance that, while no longer making them a landscape of agency and power, is an attempt to go beyond the ‘merely’ cultural significance given to the mountain identity seen in public celebrations held throughout the upland region by Christian and non-Christian Cordillerians.\n\nI try to present a uniquely Filipino approach to Catholicism between kagandahang-loób and sákop, a tug between hospitality and reduction, as an attempt of a critical phenomenology of religion. To be a Filipino is less of a static concept and more of becoming an event. The Spanish colonial conquest marked by the faith’s arrival in 1521 baptized this mobile identity as Filipino, which continued throughout history. The experience of being a Filipino thus has become an admixture that we today recognize: citizen and migrant, Asian and Western, welcoming and elitist. The cynicality of this Filipino identity is due, I argue, to our adoration of reduction: the denied independent experience of flourishing as a race to the tight embrace of the salvific promise of carrying the cross. Through this reduction, historically manifest in the Reducción, we have learned to condense our experience and ultimately to claim that hospitality is our virtue expressed as kagandanhang-/kabutihang-loób. Yet, the sheer goodness of the will is not enough to articulate the Filipino Faith, evident in the strong push against the inculturated Misa ng Sambayanang Filipino and the faith’s obvious absence in Philippine politics. A critical phenomenology of religion ought to allow one to confront the political imports of religious experience both as cause and effect. Thus, if there is any unique understanding of Catholicism’s Filipino appropriation, it is found in the search for experience within this reduction, located between the virtue of kagandahang-loób and our concept of sákop.\n\nI have waited for a book like this for a long time. Finally, Filipino evangelicals have begun to break out of the ill-fitting “wineskin” of western theology and have begun to give credence to doing Christology within their own context, a domain that has traditionally been dominated by Catholic scholars. The articles included here were originally presented at a theological symposium sponsored by the Koinonia Theological Seminary (KTS) in Davao City, Philippines, in 2014. The work is also co-sponsored by the Asia Theological Association, which has produced a number of excellent books by Asian theologians.\n\nBy way of critical appreciation, the author (an evangelical) investigates David Tracy's analysis of the Catholic imagination in relation to popular religiosity and inculturation in lowland Philippines. A survey of contemporary Evangelical and Roman Catholic views on folk religiosity sets the stage for the study as a whole. To explain and highlight the missiological significance of Tracy's approach, this study makes use of contemporary reli-gio-philosophical (hermeneutical) and missiological perspectives. Such perspectives open up the missiological usefulness of Tracy's socio-theological analysis of the Catholic imagination especially for religionists and missiologists. They also point to the naturalistic limitations of Tracy's revisionist understanding of religion even as it encounters a non-Western religious outlook such as in the Philippines. A conversation with Tracy's approach becomes an instance of dialogue between Roman Catholics and Evangelicals not only on folk Catholicism, but also on revelation, inculturation and mission.\n\nPhilippine Catholicism is usually seen as a variant of a non-European Christianity, which was formerly introduced by Spanish missionaries and colonizers into the Philippine Archipelago. Philippine passion rituals, especially self-flagellation and rites of crucifixion, are commonly interpreted as bizarre phenomena of a pre-modern folk-religiosity or archaic survivals of `our' past, or as a post-colonial mimicry of European religious history. The perspective on Philippine Christianity is always governed by European discourses, whether religious, scientific, or common sense. This paper is an attempt to question dichotomies such as `European' and `non-European,' `modern' and `pre-modern,' `authentic' and `inauthentic,' etc. In the study of religion such dichotomies, I argue, create problems of conceptualizing diversity within one religious tradition and behind such distinctions lurks the implicit self-perception of the West of being exemplary `modern.' I use Philippine passion rituals as a hermeneutic challenge. Crucifixions are analyzed as media events and from the actor's perspective, by historicizing the missionary encounter, and by scrutinizing concepts such as `syncretism' and `identity.' `Translation' and the `histoire croisée' approach are proposed as helpful analytical tools for the study of Christianity."
