        "text": "Abstract\n\nPIP: The views of heads and representatives of 5 major religious groups in the Philippines, other than the Catholic Church and the Muslims, are presented. The groups reviewed are the following: Protestants (United Methodist Church); Iglesia ni Cristo; the Philippine Independent Church (known as the Aglipayan Church); the Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi; and Jehovah's Witnesses. The United Methodist Church recognizes the need to control population growth in the Philippines and accepts all methods of family planning for as long as they are medically safe and are administered with the couple's free consent. The United Methodist Church makes family planning information and services accessible to its members by means of community centers and medical clinics. A Christian sect, the Iglesia ni Cristo, approves of the different forms of birth control and is 1 of the major agencies involved in the national population programs. It operates mobile clinics that offer all forms of family planning services. The Philippine Independent Church strongly favors the different forms of birth control and has several family planning clinics operating in the Philippines. The Iglesia Watawat Ng Lahi, a minor sect, does not see anything wrong in the use of contraception and has been responsive to the national population program. The Jehovah's Witnesses, a Christian organization, believes that the Bible is the inspiring word of God or Jehovah. As the Bible does not directly discuss birth control, birth control has never been a subject of open discussion among its members. Personal decisions relating to procreation are left to the individual's conscience."
