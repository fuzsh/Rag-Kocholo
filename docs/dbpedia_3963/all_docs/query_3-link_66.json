        "text": "This is a list of Christian denominations by number of members. It is inevitably partial and generally based on claims by the denominations themselves. The numbers should therefore be considered approximate and the article is an ongoing work-in-progress.\n\nPart of a series on\n\nJesus Christ Jesus · Virgin Mary · Virgin birth · Christmas · Crucifixion · Resurrection · Easter ·\n\nFoundations Church · New Covenant · Apostles · Kingdom · Gospel · Timeline · Paul · Peter\n\nReligious texts Bible · Old Testament · New Testament ·\n\nBooks · Canon · Apocrypha · Book of Mormon\n\nTheology Salvation · Baptism · Trinity · Father · Son · Holy Spirit · Christology · Mariology · Apologetics · Eschatology History and traditions Early · Constantine · Councils · Creeds · Missions · Chrysostom · East-West Schism · Crusades · Reformation · Counter-Reformation Denominations\n\nCatholic Roman Catholic · Anglican · Independent Catholic · Old Catholic\n\nProtestant Lutheran · Calvinist · Anabaptist · Baptist · Methodist · Adventist · Evangelical · Holiness · Pentecostal\n\nEastern\n\nEastern Orthodox · Oriental Orthodox (Miaphysite) · Assyrian\n\nNontrinitarian\n\nJehovah's Witness · Latter Day Saint · Unitarian · Christadelphian · Oneness Pentecostal\n\nGeneral topics Preaching · Prayer · Ecumenism · Relation to other religions · Christian movements · Music · Liturgy · Calendar · Symbols · Art · Criticism\n\nThe list includes the following Christian denominations: the Catholic Church including Eastern Catholic Churches as well as independent Catholic denominations, Protestant denominations with at least 200,000 members (including Anglican churches, which are sometimes described as a via media between Catholicism and Protestantism), the Eastern Orthodox Church (and its offshots), Oriental Orthodox Churches (and their offshoots) and all the other Christian branches with distinct theologies, such as Restorationist, Nontrinitarian and Nestorian denominations.\n\nChristianity is the largest religious group in the world, with an estimated 2.3 to 2.6 billion adherents in 2020.\n\nChristian denominational families\n\nThe various denominations of Christianity fall into several large families, shaped both by culture and history.\n\nChristianity arose in the first century AD after Rome had conquered much of the western parts of the fragmented Hellenistic empire created by Alexander the Great. The linguistic and cultural divisions of the first century AD Roman Empire with, broadly speaking, a Latin West and a Greek East, but also with significant areas in North Africa where Coptic was the dominant language, and areas in the Near East where Syriac or Aramaic was the dominant language, were reflected in the early Christian church. The church was called \"catholic\" meaning \"universal\" from very early in the second century, a tacit acknowledgement of the many different cultures it encompassed.\n\nThe early Christian Church suffered great, although intermittent, persecution from the state until Emperor Constantine the Great issued the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, legalizing Christianity. Shortly after the cessation of persecution, as the Church, for the first time had the luxury of reflecting on the meaning of its own teachings, significant disputes arose, particularly over the nature of Christ, and the relationship between Christ, the Father, and the Spirit. The Church chose to address those disputes with Ecumenical councils, the first four of which were at Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus and Chalcedon. The first two of these councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople gave birth to the Nicene Creed which has become the touchstone for Christian beliefs.\n\nBoth of the next two Councils, the Council of Ephesus, and the Council of Chalcedon led to significant ruptures in the Church. Many Christians espousing the minority position at these two councils, even after extensive discussion and attempts at reconciliation, chose to strike out on their own, rather than to accept the positions held by the majority of the church fathers at the councils. Refusing to accept the Council of Ephesus, the Church of the East, encompassing many Syriac speaking Christians in what was then the far East of the Empire, split off in 431 AD. A few decades later, in 451 AD, after the Council of Chalcedon, the group that later became known as the Oriental Orthodox Churches, encompassing many Coptic speaking Christians in North Africa, also split off.\n\nIn 1054 AD, an accumulation of misunderstanding, disrespect and genuine theological differences led to the Great Schism, dividing Greek speaking Christians who became the Eastern Orthodox, from Latin speaking Christians who kept the name Catholic, but increasingly prefaced it with the adjective \"Roman.\"\n\nBeginning in 1517, the remaining western, Latin speaking church was itself rent asunder by the Protestant Reformation with many Christians rejecting papal authority and gathering together in new ways. Broadly speaking Protestantism has four streams: Lutheranism, Calvinism, Anabaptism, and Anglicanism. While all of these Christian groups from the Church of the East on, have their own subsequent splits, the fragmentation in Protestantism has been extreme, with tens of thousands of denominations. Some of these fragmented groups, particularly among the Eastern churches, have sought to return to Rome, and have reunited themselves under papal authority.\n\nChristianity – 2.3 to 2.6 billion\n\nCatholicism – 1.345 billion\n\nCatholicism is the largest branch of Christianity with 1.345 billion, and the Catholic Church is the largest among churches. Figures below are in accordance with the Annuario Pontificio, at 2019. The total figure does not include independent denominations that self-identify as Catholic, numbering some 18 million adherents.\n\nEastern Catholic Churches – 18 million\n\nByzantine Rite – 8.7 million\n\nUkrainian Greek Catholic Church – 5.5 million\n\nMelkite Greek Catholic Church – 1.6 million\n\nRomanian Greek Catholic Church – 0.5 million\n\nRuthenian Greek Catholic Church – 0.4 million\n\nHungarian Greek Catholic Church – 0.3 million\n\nSlovak Greek Catholic Church – 0.3 million\n\nBelarusian Greek Catholic Church – 0.1 million\n\nItalo-Albanian Catholic Church – 0.01 million\n\nGreek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia – 0.01 million\n\nGeorgian Byzantine Catholic Church (not sui iuris) – 0.01 million\n\nAlbanian Greek Catholic Church – 0.01 million\n\nRussian Greek Catholic Church – 0.01 million\n\nGreek Byzantine Catholic Church – 0.006 million\n\nMacedonian Greek Catholic Church – 0.001 million\n\nBulgarian Greek Catholic Church – 0.001 million\n\nEast Syriac Rite – 4.9 million\n\nSyro-Malabar Catholic Church – 4.3 million\n\nChaldean Catholic Church – 0.6 million\n\nWest Syriac Rite – 4.2 million\n\nMaronite Church – 3.5 million\n\nSyro-Malankara Catholic Church – 0.5 million\n\nSyriac Catholic Church – 0.2 million\n\nArmenian Rite – 0.8 million\n\nArmenian Catholic Church – 0.8 million\n\nAlexandrian Rite – 0.5 million\n\nCoptic Catholic Church – 0.2 million\n\nEritrean Catholic Church – 0.2 million\n\nEthiopian Catholic Church – 0.07 million\n\nCanonically irregular groups\n\nSociety of Saint Pius X – 1 million\n\nSedevacantists\n\nMain article: Sedevacantism\n\nCongregation of Mary Immaculate Queen\n\nSociety of Saint Pius V\n\nIndependent Catholicism – 18 million\n\nVarious denominations that self-identify as Catholic, despite not being affiliated with the Catholic Church.\n\nPhilippine Independent Church – 6 million (in communion with the Anglican Communion)\n\nCatholic Patriotic Association – 5 million\n\nApostolic Catholic Church – 5 million\n\nTraditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church – 2 million\n\nBrazilian Catholic Apostolic Church – 0.56 million\n\nOld Catholic Church – 0.1 million (in communion with the Anglican Communion)\n\nPolish National Catholic Church – 0.03 million\n\nPalmarian Christian Church – 0.002 million\n\nProtestantism – 800 million–1 billion\n\nProtestantism is the second largest major group of Christians by number of followers. Estimates vary from 800 million to 1 billion, or between 31% and 38% of all Christians. The main reason for this wide range is the lack of a common agreement among scholars as to which denominations constitute Protestantism. For instance, most sources but not all include Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists and Independent Nondenominational Christianity as part of Protestantism. Moreover, Protestant denominations altogether do not form a single structure comparable to the Catholic Church, or to a lesser extent the Eastern Orthodox communion. However, several different comparable communions exist within Protestantism, such as the World Evangelical Alliance, Anglican Communion, World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Baptist Alliance, World Methodist Council and the World Lutheran Federation. Regardless, 900 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that this 900 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as Anabaptists, Baptists and multiple other groups that might sometimes disavow a common \"Protestant\" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, \"Christian\".\n\nHistorical Protestantism – 300–500 million\n\nThe number of individuals who are members of historical Protestant Churches totals to 300–500 million.\n\nAnglicanism – 110 million\n\nThere are about 110 million Christians in Anglican tradition, mostly part of the Anglican Communion, the third-largest Christian communion in the world, with 42 members (provinces).\n\nAnglican Communion – 85 million\n\nChurch of England – 25.0 million\n\nChurch of Nigeria – 20.1 million\n\nChurch of Uganda – 8.1 million\n\nAnglican Church of Kenya – 5.0 million\n\nChurch of South India – 3.8 million\n\nProvince of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan – 3.5 million\n\nAnglican Church of Australia – 3.1 million\n\nAnglican Church of Southern Africa – 3 million\n\nAnglican Church of Tanzania – 2.0 million\n\nEpiscopal Church in the United States – 1.6 million\n\nChurch of North India – 1.5 million\n\nProvince of the Episcopal Church of Sudan – 1.1 million\n\nAnglican Church of Rwanda – 1.0 million\n\nChurch of the Province of Central Africa – 0.9 million\n\nAnglican Church of Burundi – 0.8 million\n\nChurch in the Province of the West Indies – 0.8 million\n\nAnglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia – 0.6 million\n\nChurch of the Province of the Indian Ocean – 0.5 million\n\nChurch of Christ in the Congo–Anglican Community of Congo – 0.5 million\n\nChurch of Pakistan – 0.5 million\n\nProvince of the Anglican Church of the Congo – 0.5 million\n\nAnglican Church of Mozambique and Angola – 0.5 million\n\nAnglican Church of Canada – 0.4 million\n\nChurch of the Province of West Africa – 0.3 million\n\nChurch of Ireland – 0.3 million\n\nAnglican Church of Papua New Guinea – 0.2 million\n\nAnglican Church of Melanesia – 0.2 million\n\nEpiscopal Church in the Philippines - 0.1 million\n\nAnglican Episcopal Church of Brazil - 0.1 million\n\nAnglican Church of Mexico - 0.1 million\n\nChurch of the Province of South East Asia - 0.1 million\n\nAnglican Church of Korea - 0.1 million\n\nSpanish Reformed Episcopal Church - 0.005 million\n\nLusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church - 0.005 million\n\nContinuing Anglican movement and independent churches – 0.7 million\n\nTraditional Anglican Church – 0.4 million\n\nAnglican Church in North America – 0.1 million\n\nReformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa – 0.1 million\n\nBaptist churches – 100 million\n\nThe worldwide Baptist community numbers about 100 million. However, the Baptist World Alliance, the world communion of Baptist churches, self-reports only 51 million baptized believers, as Baptists do not count children as members, since they believe in believer's baptism. Therefore, the BWA is the 9th largest Christian communion.\n\nSouthern Baptist Convention – 13.2 million\n\nNational Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. – 8.4 million\n\nNigerian Baptist Convention – 6.5 million\n\nNational Missionary Baptist Convention of America – 3.1 million\n\nNational Baptist Convention of America International, Inc. – 3.1 million\n\nBaptist Union of Uganda – 2.5 million\n\nBaptist Community of Congo – 2.1 million\n\nBaptist Convention of Tanzania – 2.0 million\n\nBrazilian Baptist Convention – 1.8 million\n\nBaptist General Convention of Texas – 1.7 million\n\nProgressive National Baptist Convention – 1.5 million\n\nCouncil of Baptist Churches in Northeast India – 1.3 million\n\nAmerican Baptist Churches USA – 1.2 million\n\nBaptist Bible Fellowship International – 1.2 million\n\nLott Carey Foreign Mission Convention – 1.1 million\n\nBaptist Community of the Congo River – 1.1 million\n\nNational Primitive Baptist Convention of the U.S.A. – 1.0 million\n\nMyanmar Baptist Convention – 1.0 million\n\nCooperative Baptist Fellowship – 0.8 million\n\nBaptist General Association of Virginia – 0.6 million\n\nBaptist Convention of Kenya – 0.6 million\n\nNagaland Baptist Church Council – 0.6 million\n\nKorea Baptist Convention – 0.5 million\n\nSamavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches – 0.5 million\n\nOrissa Evangelical Baptist Crusade – 0.5 million\n\nNational Baptist Convention (Brazil) – 0.4 million\n\nBaptist Convention of Malawi – 0.3 million\n\nGaro Baptist Convention – 0.3 million\n\nConvention of Philippine Baptist Churches – 0.3\n\nGhana Baptist Convention – 0.3\n\nUnion of Baptist Churches in Rwanda – 0.3 million\n\nVenture Church Network – 0.2 million\n\nNational Association of Free Will Baptists – 0.2 million\n\nConvention of Visayas and Mindanao of Southern Baptist Churches – 0.2 million\n\nManipur Baptist Convention – 0.2 million\n\nEvangelical Baptist Church of the Central African Republic – 0.2 million\n\nConverge – 0.2 million\n\nSeventh Day Baptists – 0.05 million\n\nLutheranism – 70–90 million\n\nFor more details, see List of Lutheran denominations\n\nThe number of adherents in the Lutheran denominations totals to 70–90 million persons (the Lutheran World Federation reports 77 million and is the sixth largest communion) being represented in the following churches:\n\nProtestant Church in Germany – 10.8 million, with the remainder of the Protestant Church in Germany's 19.2 million members being non-Lutheran\n\nEthiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus – 10.4 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania – 7.9 million\n\nChurch of Sweden – 5.6 million\n\nUnited Evangelical Lutheran Churches in India – 4.5 million\n\nChurch of Denmark – 4.3 million\n\nBatak Christian Protestant Church – 4.1 million\n\nMalagasy Lutheran Church – 4.0 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Finland – 3.8 million\n\nChurch of Norway – 3.7 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America – 2.9 million\n\nLutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria – 2.2 million\n\nLutheran Church – Missouri Synod – 1.8 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea – 1.8 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia – 0.9 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa – 0.6 million\n\nEvangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil – 0.6 million\n\nThe Protestant Christian Church – 0.5 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Namibia – 0.4 million\n\nEvangelical Free Church of America – 0.4 million\n\nThe Indonesian Christian Church – 0.3 million\n\nLutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ – 0.3 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Cameroon – 0.3 million\n\nProtestant Church of the Augsburg Confession in Austria – 0.3 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe – 0.3 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia – 0.3 million\n\nChristian Protestant Church in Indonesia – 0.3 million\n\nWisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod – 0.3 million\n\nChurch of Iceland – 0.2 million\n\nSimalungun Protestant Christian Church – 0.2 million\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil – 0.2 million\n\nProtestant Church of the Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine – 0.2 million\n\nEvangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia – 0.2 million\n\nEvangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary – 0.2 million\n\nEstonian Evangelical Lutheran Church – 0.2 million\n\nLaestadianism (various denominations) – 0.2 million\n\nCalvinism / Reformed churches – 70–80 million\n\nThe Reformed tradition is represented by 70-80 million people who hold membership in the following churches;

the World Methodist Council (WMC) is the fifth largest communion. Not all of the following churches are member churches of the WMC. The largest Methodist denomination, the United Methodist Church, is suffering a large split by the Global Methodist Church, thus figures for the two denominations are an ongoing process.\n\nUnited Methodist Church – 12 million\n\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church – 2.5 million\n\nChurch of the Nazarene – 2.65 million\n\nMethodist Church Nigeria – 2 million\n\nThe Salvation Army – 1.8 million\n\nMethodist Church of Southern Africa – 1.7 million\n\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Zion Church – 1.4 million\n\nKorean Methodist Church – 1.3 million\n\nFree Methodist Church – 0.9 million\n\nChristian Methodist Episcopal Church – 0.9 million\n\nMethodist Church Ghana – 0.8 million\n\nMethodist Church in India – 0.6 million\n\nMethodist Church in Kenya – 0.5 million\n\nKorean Evangelical Church of America, Korean Holiness Evangelical Church – 0.5 million\n\nGlobal Methodist Church – 0.4 million\n\nWesleyan Church – 0.4 million\n\nMethodist Church in Brazil – 0.2 million\n\nMethodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma – 0.2 million\n\nAdventism – 22.7 million\n\nSeventh-day Adventist Church – 22.3 million\n\nChurch of God (Seventh-Day) – 0.2 million\n\nAdvent Christian Church - 0.1 million\n\nSeventh Day Adventist Reform Movement - 0.042 million\n\nRestorationism – 4.1 million\n\nChurches of Christ – 2 million\n\nChristian churches and churches of Christ – 1.1 million\n\nCommunity of Disciples of Christ in Congo – 0.7 million\n\nChristian Church (Disciples of Christ) – 0.3 million\n\nAnabaptism – 4 million\n\nMennonites – 2.1 million\n\nSchwarzenau Brethren (German Baptists) – 1.5 million\n\nAmish – 0.3 million\n\nHutterites – 0.05 million\n\nHussites – 1.2 million\n\nMoravian Church – 1.1 million\n\nCzechoslovak Hussite Church – 0.099 million\n\nUnity of the Brethren Baptists – 0.035 million\n\nPlymouth Brethren – 1 million\n\nThe Plymouth Brethren number around 1 million members.\n\nModern Protestantism – 400–500 million\n\nThe denominations listed below did not emerge from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century or its commonly acknowledged offshoots. Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism.

Most of these denominations came into being when existing Protestant Churches adopted reformational variants of Eastern Orthodox liturgy and worship; while others are the result of reformations of Eastern Orthodox beliefs and practices, inspired by the teachings of Western Protestant missionaries. Some Protestant Eastern Churches are in communion with similar Western Protestant Churches. However, Protestant Eastern Christianity within itself, does not constitute a single communion. This is due to the diverse polities, practices, liturgies and orientations of the denominations which fall under this category.\n\nEthiopian-Eritrean Evangelical Church – 16.5 million, Alexandrian Rite\n\nBelievers Eastern Church – 3.5 million, West Syrian Rite\n\nMar Thoma Syrian Church – 1 million, Syro-Antiochene Rite (in communion with the Anglican Communion)\n\nArmenian Evangelical Church – 0.25 million, Armenian Rite\n\nSt. Thomas Evangelical Church of India - 0.1 million, Syro-Antiochene Rite\n\nEvangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia - 0.02 million, Byzantine Rite\n\nEvangelical Church of Romania – 0.16 million, Byzantine Rite\n\nKosovo Protestant Evangelical Church – 0.15 million, Byzantine Rite\n\nEastern Orthodoxy – 220 million\n\nThe best estimate of the number of Eastern Orthodox Christians is 220 million or 80% of all Orthodox Christians worldwide.
