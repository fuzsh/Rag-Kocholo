You will be encouraged to attend seriously to the political insights of an older era of Christendom, while also seeking to creatively apply this heritage to the very different context and fresh challenges of our own day.\n\nEach day will begin with Scripture study on a passage relevant to the theme of the course, with afternoons spent in lectures and Socratic discussion seminars. In addition to accessible contemporary introductions, students will grapple with key texts in the Christian tradition that shed light on the relationship of Christian faith and political life.\n\nWHY TAKE THE COURSE?\n\nYou will join us this summer for one of our Protestant Wisdom Foundations courses at The Davenant House and experience a deep dive into how to be an intelligent, faithful, and historically-grounded Protestant in the twenty-first century.\n\nStudents will spend twelve days in the beautiful and restful setting of our Davenant House retreat center in the Carolina Blue Ridge foothills: worshiping together, preparing meals together, reading together, debating together, and learning from our team of gifted teachers.\n\nEach day’s schedule will also have time for gardening, quiet reflection, or nature walks in the woods.\n\nThe cost for attending the program is just $1200 ($849 if you register by April 15th), with some scholarship opportunities available.\n\nThis includes all of your meals, room and board for the period of your stay. Although we encourage students to be residential for the full experience, a limited number of commuter students will be accepted. Some scholarships are available for students for whom the cost is prohibitive.\n\nIf you are tired of easy answers for hard questions, you fit the vision of the Davenant House."
