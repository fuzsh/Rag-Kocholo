Throughout history, missionaries have worked to spread the word and love of God throughout the world, spiritually enriching countless lives. Learn which countries have large Catholic populations and why Catholicism is so important to their citizens.\n\nHelp Us Reach People Around the World\n\nJump to Country:\n\nBrazil\n\nMexico\n\nThe Philippines\n\nThe United States\n\nItaly\n\nFrance\n\nColombia\n\nPoland\n\nSpain\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nCatholic Population by Region\n\nCatholicism is one of the most common religions throughout the world, but these numbers vary depending on the region. For example, most of Asia does not practice Catholicism, but Southeast Asia has a larger Catholic population. The Philippines, in particular, is one of the most predominantly Catholic countries in the world.\n\nWith 39% of the population identifying as Catholic, Latin America is the region with the most Catholics. The Middle East and North Africa are regions with the lowest rates of Catholics, making up less than 1% of the world’s Catholics. North America (8%) and Asia (12%) are also continents with lower Catholic demographics.\n\nTop 10 Countries With a Predominantly Catholic Population\n\nThe Catholic Church is an important aspect of many peoples’ lives worldwide. Throughout history, the beauty and joy of Catholicism and God have been shared with the world, allowing others to grow emotionally and spiritually. Even today, Catholic missionaries continue God’s work by sharing His teachings and love across the globe. Here are the top 10 countries with the highest number of Catholic citizens:\n\n1. Brazil\n\nBrazil is one of the most devout Catholic countries globally, with approximately 54.2% of people identifying as Catholic. This percentage translates to roughly 126.8 million Catholics in Brazil. The Portuguese introduced Catholicism to Brazil, and the original diocese was created in 1551.\n\nCatholicism has remained the official religion of Brazil even after its independence. In Brazil, the church plays a large role in daily life and is meaningful to millions of families.\n\nSee our Work in Brazil\n\n2. Mexico\n\nIn terms of the number of people, Mexico is one of the countries with a large Catholic population, with approximately 98.8 million citizens identifying as Catholic.

The Philippines\n\nThere are approximately 76 million Catholics in the Philippines, which equates to about 81% of citizens. When it comes to Catholic countries in Asia, the Philippines has one of the largest Catholic populations.

France\n\nIn France, approximately 40 million citizens practice Catholicism. Roughly 63% to 66% of the French population identifies as Catholic. France also has a long history of Christianity and Catholicism, with some of the earliest signs of Christianity in France documented in the second century. Today, Catholicism remains an important aspect of life for many French adults and families.\n\n7. Colombia\n\nColombia has approximately 36 million Catholics, totaling about 75% of the population. The Spanish first brought Catholicism to Colombia in 1508, and the first diocese was created in 1534. In 1819, Colombia received independence from Spain, but Catholicism remained a major religion for most of the population. Colombia is one of the most devout Catholic countries in South America.\n\nSee our Work in Colombia\n\n8. Poland\n\nPoland is a very religious country with over 33 million citizens practicing Catholicism, which makes up around 87% of the population.
