One of the most fundamental differences lies in their understanding of the nature of God and Jesus Christ.\n\nThe INC rejects the doctrine of the Trinity, which is central to Catholic theology. While Catholics believe in one God existing as three divine persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), the INC teaches that there is only one God, the Father, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God but not divine himself(Andō, 1969). This non-Trinitarian stance sets the INC apart from mainstream Christian denominations, including Catholicism.\n\nAnother crucial difference is in their understanding of salvation. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation is available to all through faith in Jesus Christ and participation in the sacraments of the Church. In contrast, the INC believes that salvation is only possible through membership in their church, which they consider to be the true Church of Christ(Andō, 1969). This exclusivist view of salvation is a significant point of contention between the two groups.\n\nThe role of Mary and the saints also differs greatly between these two churches. Catholics venerate Mary as the Mother of God and pray to saints for intercession. The INC, however, rejects these practices, considering them forms of idolatry(Andō, 1969). They believe in direct prayer to God without the need for intermediaries.\n\nRegarding the afterlife, while both churches believe in heaven and hell, their concepts differ. The Catholic Church teaches about purgatory as a place of purification after death, a doctrine that the INC does not accept(Andō, 1969).\n\nThe INC also has a different interpretation of the Church’s role in society and politics. Unlike the Catholic Church, which often takes public stances on social and political issues, the INC practices bloc voting, where members are expected to vote as a unified group for candidates endorsed by church leadership(Andō, 1969; Bermúdez, 2020). This practice gives the INC significant political influence in the Philippines.\n\nLastly, the INC has a strong emphasis on financial contributions from members, considering it a duty for salvation. While the Catholic Church also encourages giving, it does not typically tie it directly to salvation in the same way(Andō, 1969).\n\nThese doctrinal differences have led to significant tensions between the two groups, particularly in the Philippines where both have a strong presence. The INC often positions itself in opposition to Catholic teachings, seeing itself as a restoration of true Christian doctrine(Tolentino, 2010). This has resulted in ongoing theological debates and sometimes social conflicts between adherents of these two faiths.\n\nWhat is the historical background of Iglesia Ni Cristo and how does it compare to the Catholic Church?\n\nThe historical backgrounds of Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church are vastly different, reflecting their distinct origins and development over time.\n\nThe Catholic Church traces its origins back to Jesus Christ and the Apostles in the 1st century AD. It developed over centuries, becoming the dominant Christian church in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. The Catholic Church has a long history of global missionary work, including in the Philippines, where it arrived with Spanish colonizers in the 16th century(Rosario et al., 2023). By the time the INC was founded, Catholicism had been deeply entrenched in Philippine society for over 300 years.\n\nIn contrast, the Iglesia ni Cristo is a much younger religious movement. It was founded by Felix Manalo in 1914 in the Philippines(Rosario et al., 2023). Manalo, a former Catholic who had explored various Protestant denominations, claimed to have received a divine calling to restore the true Church of Christ. The INC emerged during a period of significant social and political change in the Philippines, as the country transitioned from Spanish to American colonial rule(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nThe INC’s growth was rapid, particularly among Filipinos dissatisfied with the Catholic Church’s association with Spanish colonialism. It positioned itself as a native Filipino church, free from foreign influence(Rosario et al., 2023). This nationalistic appeal contributed to its expansion, especially among the working class and in urban areas.\n\nWhile the Catholic Church’s influence in the Philippines has been longstanding and pervasive, affecting culture, politics, and social norms, the INC has carved out a significant niche for itself. It has grown from a small, localized group to a global organization with millions of members, primarily of Filipino descent(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nThe INC’s development has been marked by a strong centralized leadership structure and a focus on rapid expansion. Unlike the Catholic Church, which has a long tradition of theological development and adaptation, the INC has maintained a relatively consistent doctrinal stance since its founding(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nPolitically, the two churches have taken different approaches. The Catholic Church in the Philippines has often been involved in social and political issues, playing a significant role in events like the People Power Revolution of 1986. The INC, on the other hand, has developed a system of bloc voting, where members are expected to vote as a unified group for candidates endorsed by church leadership(Andō, 1969; Bermúdez, 2020). This practice has given the INC considerable political influence despite its smaller size compared to the Catholic Church.\n\nIn terms of global presence, the Catholic Church is a worldwide institution with over a billion members across all continents. The INC, while it has expanded internationally, remains primarily a Filipino church with its strongest presence in the Philippines and among Filipino diaspora communities(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nThe historical trajectories of these two churches reflect broader trends in Philippine religious history. The INC’s emergence and growth represent a challenge to the traditional dominance of the Catholic Church, reflecting changing social dynamics and a desire for indigenous religious expression in the post-colonial era(Rosario et al., 2023; Tolentino, 2010).\n\nIglesia Ni Cristo Vs. Catholic: worship practices\n\nThe worship practices of Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church differ significantly, reflecting their distinct theological beliefs and historical backgrounds.\n\nIn Catholic worship, the central act is the Mass, which includes the Eucharist or Holy Communion. Catholics believe in transubstantiation – that the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ during the Mass(Gil, 2006). The Mass is highly structured, following a set liturgy that includes readings from the Bible, prayers, hymns, and the Eucharistic celebration. Catholic churches are often ornate, featuring statues, paintings, and other religious imagery to aid in worship and devotion.\n\nIn contrast, INC worship services, known as pagsamba, are more austere and focused primarily on preaching and congregational singing(Andō, 1969). The INC rejects the use of religious imagery, considering it a form of idolatry. Their church buildings are typically simple in design, without crosses or other religious symbols that are common in Catholic churches.\n\nThe frequency and timing of worship also differ. Catholics are obligated to attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation, while INC members are expected to attend services twice a week, typically on Thursdays and Sundays(Andō, 1969). INC services are known for their punctuality and discipline, with members expected to arrive on time and stay for the entire service.\n\nPrayer practices also vary. Catholics often use set prayers like the Our Father and Hail Mary, and may pray to saints for intercession. The INC, however, emphasizes direct prayer to God through Jesus Christ, rejecting the practice of praying to saints or Mary(Andō, 1969).\n\nMusic plays a role in both traditions, but in different ways. Catholic Masses often include hymns and may feature choirs or organs. INC services include congregational singing, with hymns composed specifically for the church. The INC places great emphasis on the quality of musical performance in their services(Andō, 1969).\n\nThe sacraments are another area of significant difference. The Catholic Church recognizes seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. The INC, however, only practices Baptism and Holy Supper (their version of Communion), and these are understood differently than in Catholicism(Andō, 1969).\n\nFasting and dietary restrictions also differ. Catholics traditionally abstain from meat on Fridays during Lent and observe other fasting practices. The INC does not have specific dietary restrictions but encourages fasting as a spiritual discipline(Andō, 1969).\n\nThe role of the clergy in worship also varies. In Catholic Mass, the priest plays a central role, particularly in the consecration of the Eucharist. In INC services, ministers lead the worship and deliver sermons, but there is no equivalent to the Catholic understanding of priestly authority(Andō, 1969).\n\nLastly, the language of worship differs. While Catholic Masses are now typically conducted in the local language following the Second Vatican Council, Latin is still used in some contexts. INC services are conducted in the language of the local congregation, with an emphasis on Filipino in the Philippines(Andō, 1969).\n\nThese differences in worship practices reflect the distinct theological positions and historical developments of each church, contributing to their separate identities within Philippine Christianity.\n\nHow does Iglesia Ni Cristo interpret the Bible compared to the Catholic Church?\n\nThe Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church have significantly different approaches to interpreting the Bible, reflecting their distinct theological traditions and historical contexts.\n\nThe INC adheres to a strict literal interpretation of the Bible, which they consider to be the sole source of religious authority(Andō, 1969). They reject the use of extra-biblical sources or traditions in interpreting scripture, a stance that contrasts sharply with Catholic practice. The INC believes that the Bible contains all necessary truths for salvation and that it should be interpreted plainly and directly.\n\nIn contrast, the Catholic Church employs a more complex hermeneutical approach. While Catholics also consider the Bible to be divinely inspired and inerrant, they do not see it as the sole source of religious truth. The Catholic Church teaches that scripture should be interpreted in light of Sacred Tradition and the Magisterium (the teaching authority of the Church)(Gil, 2006). This approach, often referred to as the “three-legged stool” of Catholic theology, allows for a more nuanced and contextual interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nThe INC’s literal interpretation leads them to reject many traditional Christian doctrines that are not explicitly stated in the Bible. For example, they do not accept the doctrine of the Trinity, arguing that it is not clearly taught in scripture(Andō, 1969). They interpret passages that speak of Jesus’ divinity as referring to his role as God’s chosen messenger, not as an indication of his divine nature.\n\nCatholic biblical interpretation, on the other hand, allows for allegorical, moral, and anagogical (spiritual) readings of scripture in addition to the literal sense. This approach, rooted in patristic and medieval exegetical traditions, enables Catholics to find deeper meanings in biblical texts beyond their surface-level interpretations(Gil, 2006).\n\nThe INC’s approach to prophecy is another area of divergence. They place great emphasis on biblical prophecies, particularly those they believe predict the emergence of their church in the “last days”(Andō, 1969). They interpret various Old Testament prophecies as referring specifically to the founding of the INC in the Philippines in 1914. Catholic interpretation, while acknowledging the importance of prophecy, tends to be more cautious about applying specific prophecies to contemporary events.\n\nRegarding the New Testament, the INC focuses heavily on the epistles of Paul, particularly his teachings on church organization and salvation. They interpret these passages as supporting their view of the church as a necessary institution for salvation(Andō, 1969). Catholic interpretation, while also valuing Paul’s writings, places them within the broader context of the entire New Testament and church tradition.\n\nThe role of biblical scholarship also differs between the two churches. The Catholic Church has a long tradition of biblical scholarship and encourages the use of historical-critical methods in studying scripture, alongside faith-based readings(Gil, 2006). The INC, however, is generally skeptical of academic biblical scholarship, preferring to rely on their own internal interpretations.\n\nLastly, the INC’s interpretation of the Bible leads them to reject many Catholic practices and beliefs not explicitly mentioned in scripture, such as the veneration of saints, the use of religious images, and the doctrine of purgatory(Andō, 1969). They see these as unbiblical additions to true Christianity.\n\nThese differing approaches to biblical interpretation have significant implications for the theology and practice of each church, contributing to their distinct identities within the broader landscape of Christianity.\n\nIglesia Ni Cristo Vs. Catholic: structure of church leadership\n\nThe structure of church leadership in Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church differs significantly, reflecting their distinct theological beliefs, historical development, and organizational philosophies.\n\nThe Catholic Church has a hierarchical structure that has evolved over nearly two millennia. At the top is the Pope, considered the successor of St. Peter and the Vicar of Christ on Earth. Below the Pope are Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and priests(Gil, 2006). This hierarchy is based on the doctrine of apostolic succession, which holds that the authority given by Jesus to his apostles has been passed down through an unbroken line of successors.\n\nIn contrast, the INC has a more centralized and authoritarian structure. At the apex is the Executive Minister, currently Eduardo V. Manalo, grandson of the church’s founder Felix Manalo(Rosario et al., 2023). The Executive Minister is believed to be God’s chosen messenger and has absolute authority over church affairs. This position is typically passed down within the Manalo family, creating a dynastic leadership model.\n\nThe Catholic Church’s leadership is geographically distributed, with local parishes led by priests, dioceses by bishops, and national or regional conferences of bishops coordinating broader issues. The INC, however, maintains a more centralized control from its headquarters in the Philippines, with local congregations having limited autonomy(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nIn terms of clergy, the Catholic Church has a celibate, all-male priesthood (in the Latin Rite), with priests undergoing years of seminary training. The INC allows its ministers to marry and does not require the same extensive theological education(Andō, 1969). However, the INC maintains strict control over its ministers, who are expected to adhere closely to official church doctrine and practices.\n\nThe role of laity also differs between the two churches. The Catholic Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council, has emphasized the importance of lay participation in church life and ministry(Gil, 2006). The INC, while involving lay members in various church activities, maintains a clearer distinction between clergy and laity, with key decisions and interpretations coming from the central leadership(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nFinancial management is another area of difference. The Catholic Church has a decentralized financial structure, with individual dioceses and parishes managing their own finances, albeit with oversight from higher levels. The INC has a more centralized financial system, with significant emphasis placed on members’ financial contributions, which are seen as a duty for salvation(Andō, 1969).\n\nThe process of decision-making and doctrinal development also differs. The Catholic Church has a long tradition of councils and synods to address theological and pastoral issues, with the Pope having the final say on matters of faith and morals(Gil, 2006). The INC’s doctrinal positions are determined by the Executive Minister and the central leadership, with little room for debate or dissent(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nPolitical engagement is another area where leadership structures diverge. The Catholic Church, while influential, generally maintains a separation between church and state. The INC, however, practices bloc voting, where members are expected to vote as a unified group for candidates endorsed by church leadership(Andō, 1969; Bermúdez, 2020). This gives the INC leadership significant political influence, especially in the Philippines.\n\nLastly, the global reach of these churches affects their leadership structures. The Catholic Church is truly global, with leadership representation from around the world. The INC, while it has expanded internationally, remains primarily Filipino in its leadership and cultural orientation(Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nWhat is the stance of Iglesia Ni Cristo on the authority of the Pope?\n\nIglesia ni Cristo (INC) takes a fundamentally different stance on papal authority compared to the Catholic Church. While the Catholic Church recognizes the Pope as the supreme pontiff and visible head of the Church on earth, INC rejects this notion entirely.\n\nINC was founded in 1914 by Felix Manalo, who claimed to be God’s last messenger. The church teaches that the true Church of Christ was restored through Manalo after centuries of apostasy following the death of the original apostles. As such, INC does not recognize the authority of the Pope or the apostolic succession claimed by the Catholic Church (Andō, 1969; Cornelio, 2017).\n\nFor INC, the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice is the Bible alone, interpreted through the lens of their founder’s teachings. They believe that Christ is the head of the Church, and that no human leader can claim universal authority over all Christians. This stands in stark contrast to Catholic doctrine on papal primacy and infallibility.\n\nINC’s rejection of papal authority is rooted in their interpretation of Scripture and their understanding of church history. They argue that there is no biblical basis for the papacy and that the office developed gradually over time as a result of human ambition rather than divine institution.\n\nThis fundamental disagreement on ecclesiastical authority creates a significant barrier between INC and the Catholic Church. While the Catholic Church sees the Pope as essential for maintaining unity and preserving apostolic teaching, INC views the papacy as an unbiblical institution that detracts from Christ’s unique role as head of the Church.\n\nIt’s worth noting that INC’s stance on papal authority aligns more closely with many Protestant denominations, which also reject papal claims. However, INC goes further in asserting that they alone represent the true Church of Christ restored in the last days (Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nThis rejection of papal authority has practical implications for INC’s relationship with the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations. It means that INC does not participate in ecumenical dialogues or initiatives that recognize the Pope’s leadership role in Christianity. Instead, INC maintains a more exclusivist stance, focusing on its own growth and mission rather than seeking unity with other Christian groups (Camille et al., n.d.).\n\nWhat are the differences in the teachings on afterlife and eschatology between Iglesia Ni Cristo and the Catholic Church?\n\nThe teachings on afterlife and eschatology (the study of end times) differ significantly between Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church, reflecting their distinct theological frameworks.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo’s eschatology is heavily influenced by their interpretation of biblical prophecy and their belief in Felix Manalo as God’s last messenger. INC teaches that only its members will be saved on the Day of Judgment. They believe in a final judgment where the righteous (INC members) will be rewarded with eternal life in heaven, while the unrighteous will face eternal punishment (Andō, 1969; Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nINC rejects the Catholic concepts of purgatory and limbo. For them, there are only two possible destinations after death: heaven for the saved (INC members) and hell for the unsaved. This binary view of the afterlife is more aligned with some Protestant denominations than with Catholic theology.\n\nIn contrast, Catholic eschatology is more complex. Catholics believe in heaven, hell, and purgatory. They teach that those who die in God’s grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, undergo purification in purgatory to achieve the holiness necessary to enter heaven. The Catholic Church also holds the concept of the communion of saints, where there is a spiritual solidarity between the faithful on earth, the souls in purgatory, and the saints in heaven (Canto, 2020; Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nRegarding the end times, both INC and the Catholic Church believe in the Second Coming of Christ and a final judgment. However, their interpretations of these events differ. INC tends to interpret end-time prophecies more literally and sees current world events as signs of the imminent return of Christ. The Catholic Church, while affirming Christ’s return, is generally more cautious about predicting its timing or interpreting current events as definitive signs.\n\nAnother significant difference lies in their understanding of salvation. INC teaches that salvation is only possible through membership in their church, while the Catholic Church, especially since Vatican II, has a more inclusive view of salvation. While affirming that the fullness of salvation is found in the Catholic Church, it also recognizes the possibility of salvation for non-Catholics and even non-Christians who sincerely seek God and follow their conscience (Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThese differences in afterlife and eschatological teachings reflect the broader theological divergences between INC and the Catholic Church. They stem from different approaches to biblical interpretation, church authority, and the nature of salvation. For INC, these teachings reinforce their exclusive claims as the true Church, while for the Catholic Church, they reflect a more universalist understanding of God’s salvific will (Camille et al., n.d.; Initiatives, 2012).\n\nWhat is the membership process in Iglesia Ni Cristo compared to the Catholic Church?\n\nThe membership processes in Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church differ significantly, reflecting their distinct ecclesiologies and understandings of salvation.\n\nIn Iglesia ni Cristo, the path to membership is quite structured and exclusive. Prospective members must undergo a rigorous process of indoctrination before they can be baptized into the church. This typically involves attending a series of Bible studies where INC doctrines are taught systematically. These studies cover INC’s interpretations of Scripture, their understanding of church history, and their unique teachings about salvation and the end times (Andō, 1969; Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nA key aspect of INC’s membership process is the emphasis on accepting their core beliefs, particularly the role of Felix Manalo as God’s last messenger and the INC as the true Church of Christ. Prospective members must demonstrate a clear understanding and acceptance of these doctrines before they can be considered for baptism.\n\nOnce a person has completed the required studies and expressed their desire to join, they undergo baptism by immersion. This baptism is seen as essential for salvation in INC theology. After baptism, new members are expected to actively participate in church activities, attend worship services regularly, and contribute financially to the church (Camille et al., n.d.).\n\nIn contrast, the Catholic Church’s process of becoming a member is generally more inclusive and flexible. For those born into Catholic families, membership typically begins with infant baptism. For adults converting to Catholicism, the process is known as the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA).\n\nRCIA is a gradual process that includes several stages: inquiry, catechumenate, purification and enlightenment, and mystagogy. During these stages, candidates learn about Catholic doctrine, participate in liturgical rites, and gradually become integrated into the Catholic community. The process culminates in the reception of the sacraments of initiation: Baptism (if not previously baptized), Confirmation, and Eucharist (Canto, 2020; Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nUnlike INC, the Catholic Church recognizes the validity of baptisms performed in most other Christian denominations. This means that Christians from other traditions who wish to become Catholic do not need to be rebaptized if they were previously baptized with water in the name of the Trinity.\n\nAnother significant difference is that while INC sees church membership as necessary for salvation, the Catholic Church has a more nuanced view. While affirming that the fullness of salvation is found in the Catholic Church, it also recognizes the possibility of salvation for non-Catholics who sincerely seek God (Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThe Catholic Church also has a more developed system of ongoing formation for its members, including various sacraments and spiritual practices throughout one’s life. In contrast, INC places a strong emphasis on continued loyalty and adherence to church teachings after initial membership (Initiatives, 2012).\n\nThese differences in membership processes reflect the broader theological and ecclesiological distinctions between INC and the Catholic Church, particularly in their understanding of the nature of the Church and the requirements for salvation.\n\nHow do Iglesia Ni Cristo and the Catholic Church view the role of saints and martyrs?\n\nThe views on saints and martyrs differ significantly between Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church, reflecting their distinct theological frameworks and approaches to Christian history and tradition.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo takes a minimalist approach to the concept of saints and martyrs. In INC theology, there is no formal veneration or invocation of saints as intercessors. They believe that Christ alone is the mediator between God and humanity, and that praying to or through saints detracts from Christ’s unique role (Andō, 1969; Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nINC’s focus is primarily on the biblical figures and early Christian martyrs mentioned in Scripture. However, they do not accord these figures any special status beyond their historical significance. The emphasis is on learning from their examples of faith rather than seeking their intercession or venerating them as the Catholic Church does.\n\nMoreover, INC does not have a process of canonization or formal recognition of saints. Their understanding of “saints” is more in line with the New Testament usage of the term, referring to all believers in Christ rather than a special category of exceptionally holy individuals (Camille et al., n.d.).\n\nIn contrast, the Catholic Church has a rich and complex tradition regarding saints and martyrs. In Catholic theology, saints are individuals who have led lives of exceptional holiness and are now in heaven with God. The Church believes that these saints can intercede on behalf of the faithful on earth (Canto, 2020; Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThe Catholic Church has a formal process of canonization through which individuals are recognized as saints. This process involves a thorough investigation of the person’s life, virtues, and any miracles attributed to their intercession after death. Once canonized, saints are venerated by the faithful, who may pray for their intercession and seek to emulate their virtues.\n\nMartyrs hold a special place in Catholic tradition. Those who die for their faith are considered to have given the ultimate witness and are often fast-tracked in the canonization process. The Church sees martyrdom as a powerful testimony to the truth of the Gospel and the depth of one’s faith (Hedlund, 2009).\n\nThe Catholic understanding of the communion of saints is a key aspect of their ecclesiology. This doctrine teaches that there is a spiritual solidarity between the faithful on earth, the souls in purgatory, and the saints in heaven. This communion is expressed through prayer, with the living praying for the dead and seeking the intercession of the saints (Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThese differing views on saints and martyrs have practical implications for worship and spirituality. Catholic churches often feature statues and images of saints, and the liturgical calendar includes feast days honoring various saints. In contrast, INC places of worship are typically austere, focusing solely on God and Christ without representations of saints or other figures (Initiatives, 2012).\n\nThe stark difference in these approaches reflects the broader theological divergences between INC and the Catholic Church, particularly in their understanding of church history, tradition, and the nature of the Christian community across time and eternity.\n\nHow do Iglesia Ni Cristo and the Catholic Church interact with other Christian denominations?\n\nIglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Catholic Church have markedly different approaches to interacting with other Christian denominations, reflecting their distinct ecclesiologies and understandings of Christian unity.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo generally maintains a stance of exclusivity in its interactions with other Christian groups. INC teaches that it is the one true Church of Christ, restored in the last days through its founder, Felix Manalo. This belief leads to a limited engagement with other denominations, as INC sees itself as uniquely possessing the fullness of truth (Andō, 1969; Rosario et al., 2023).\n\nINC does not typically participate in ecumenical dialogues or interfaith initiatives. Instead, their primary mode of interaction with other Christian groups is through evangelization efforts aimed at converting members of other denominations to INC. They view other Christian churches as being in error and in need of the true gospel as understood by INC (Camille et al., n.d.).\n\nThis exclusivist stance means that INC does not recognize the validity of other Christian baptisms or ordinations. They require all new members, regardless of their previous Christian background, to undergo INC’s specific process of indoctrination and baptism. This approach creates clear boundaries between INC and other Christian groups (Cornelio, 2017).\n\nIn contrast, the Catholic Church has a more nuanced and engaged approach to ecumenism, especially since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). While the Catholic Church maintains that it possesses the fullness of truth and means of salvation, it also recognizes elements of sanctification and truth in other Christian denominations (Canto, 2020; Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThe Catholic Church actively participates in ecumenical dialogues and initiatives aimed at fostering greater understanding and unity among Christian churches. These efforts are guided by the principle of “unity in diversity,” recognizing that while full doctrinal agreement may not be immediately achievable, Christians can work together on shared concerns and grow in mutual understanding (Hedlund, 2009).\n\nCatholic ecumenism distinguishes between “full communion” and “imperfect communion.” While only a few Eastern churches are considered to be in full communion with Rome, the Catholic Church recognizes a degree of communion with all baptized Christians. This recognition extends to accepting the validity of baptisms performed in most other Christian denominations (Suarez-Crizaldo, 2005).\n\nThe Catholic Church’s approach to other Christian groups varies depending on their perceived closeness to Catholic doctrine. For instance, there are ongoing dialogues with Orthodox churches aimed at restoring full communion, while interactions with Protestant denominations focus on areas of common concern and gradual rapprochement (Mulzac, 2007).\n\nThese differing approaches to inter-denominational relations have practical implications. While INC tends to focus on its own growth and mission independently of other Christian groups, the Catholic Church is more likely to collaborate with other denominations on social issues, humanitarian efforts, and shared spiritual concerns (Initiatives, 2012).\n\nThe contrast between INC’s exclusivist stance and the Catholic Church’s ecumenical approach reflects their different understandings of the nature of the Church, the scope of God’s salvific will, and the path to Christian unity. These differences continue to shape their respective roles in the broader Christian landscape and their interactions with the diverse tapestry of Christian denominations worldwide (Camille et al., n.d.)."
