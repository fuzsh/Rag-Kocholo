        "text": "Various colonial experiences in Asia have shaped the social, political as well as religious landscape in Asia. The Philippines, long dominated by Western colonial powers—more than three hundred years under Spain and almost fifty under the United States—became the only Christian country in Asia with more than ninety percent of the total Catholic population in Asia. When the U.S. took over the colonial domination after Spain, various U.S. colonial and postcolonial influences were introduced and their political, economical and social systems penetrated into the Philippines (Goda, 1999, 2003; Hunchcroft, 2000; Abinales and Amoroso, 2005; Hidalgo and Patajo-Legasto, 2005; Go and Foster, 2005). And Protestant denominations based on U.S. have been operated their missions into the country through over a century. With the social, political as well as religious influx of foreign and Christian influences within Philippine context, the Philippines seemed to be a good place to examine the modern...\n\nAs a country where more than 80% of the citizens belong to one religious group, the Philippines provides an interesting case study for the topic of our conference, Religions and Civil Society/State. This paper offers an analysis of the dynamics between Catholicism and Philippine society with special reference to two recent pastoral letters of the Catholic Bishops&#39; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). These letters came from the entire body composed of all active and retired bishops, and were written for dissemination among Catholics throughout the country. The two letters issued in 1998 and 1999 focus on politics and culture respectively; hence their relevance to our conference theme.\n\nThis study demonstrates the extensive contribution of successive mission policies from 1901 to 1980 to the regional character of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines (ECP). The policy of concentration from 1901 to 1919, which focused church’s work in certain areas of Luzon and Mindanao, continued to impact the development of its mission in spite of the adoption of new policies in the succeeding years. This is because it was primarily developed in relation to the issue of marginality in Philippine society, a factor that remained vital to new policies although it was not always explicitly acknowledged. Although the policy of consolidation from 1920 to 1940 aimed at strengthening the initial mission work, it also allowed expansion for the sake of marginalized people like the Tiruray in Upi, Maguindanao. After World War II to 1962, the church adopted policies of centralization - gathering key institutions in one centre - and expansion of influence - bringing church’s influence to the..."
