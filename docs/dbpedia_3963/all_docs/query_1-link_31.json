        "text": "The strong belief in Anito (or ancestor spirits and nature spirits) is referred to as Anitism. It is the traditional religion of the ancient Filipinos. In anitism, the creator of the well-being and the supreme God of the Filipinos has been called by the locals as Bathala since prehistoric times.\n\nMany ethnic people and tribal groups in the Philippines living in the mountainous and remote areas continue to practice and conserve their unique indigenous religious beliefs in the Philippines, including their strong faith in Anito.\n\nAs a “melting pot of Eastern and Western culture”, the Philippines traditions are greatly influenced by indigenous Austronesean folks who wandered around the Philippines around 2200 BCE (Before the Common Era). Igorots in the Central Cordilleras, are one of many native people in the Philippines, who still uphold the way of life and beliefs in spirits. Know more about the unique and rich culture of the Igorots.\n\nCatholicism, on the other hand, was brought to the Philippines by the Spanish explorers and missionaries in the 16th century. These people reached and settled in Cebu, in the southern part of the Philippines, and started to colonize and spread Catholicism to the natives of the place.\n\nNote that Catholicism, specifically Roman Catholicism has become the largest Christian branch of the religious denomination among the majority of Filipinos. Here are some interesting facts about the Filipino culture and values that you might discover.\n\nYou might be asking who brought Islam to the Philippines. It was the Arab missionaries and Malay Muslim merchants and sailors. Islam, as the second-largest religion in the country, was introduced to the Philippines during the late 14th century. Following the trade route in South East Asia, these merchants and sailors reached Sulu Islands in the Southern part of Mindanao.\n\nCheck out the archipelagic and geography of the Philippines consisting of more than 7,600 islands.\n\nThe church follows the teaching of Jesus Christ, but strongly opposes the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrine and the leadership of the Pope. Its members are mostly in the northern part of Luzon and throughout the Philippines including the diaspora (Jewish people living outside Israel) in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia."
