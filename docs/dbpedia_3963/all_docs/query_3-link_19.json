        "text": "OP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 204\n\nBelow is apost from another site. I have made my comments as a Latin Catholic personally on the author. I osted this because I'd like to see the forum's views on this essay.\n\nRegards,\n\nruel\n\n_______________________\n\nThe Greatest Error of Protestantism\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis essay is written from the worldview (perspective, paradigm) of an\n\nOrthodox Christian, by a person studying Orthodox to understand what they\n\nbelieve and how they view other Christians who are not Orthodox. This essay is\n\nopen for correction by others who know better than I do. (RCD)\n\nThe Greatest Error of Protestantism is a denial of the clear teaching of\n\nScripture. Jesus taught in John 16:13 \"He (The Spirit of Truth or the Holy\n\nSpirit)will guide you into all the truth...\" Jesus first spoke these words to\n\nhis disciples who would latter be the Apostles. They were concerned because\n\nJesus told them of His departure from this world. They wondered who would lead\n\nthem when Jesus was gone? Who would instruct them in the way they should go?\n\nFor three years Jesus taught and guided them. So Jesus comforts his disciples\n\nby promising to them that he would not leave them orphans, but he would send\n\nthe Spirit of truth (John 14:18). For Jesus would send them another comforter,\n\nthe Holy Spirit, who would guide them into ALL the truth(John 16:13).\n\nHow would the Holy Spirit guide the Church into all the truth?\n\nFirst of all, the Spirit of Truth would guided the New Testament writers to\n\nprepared the new written revelation that would take its place along side the\n\nOld Testament scriptures. The Holy Spirit will remind the disciples the\n\nteaching of Jesus for the Gospels (14:26), interpret the gospel for the present\n\nwriting of the Acts and Epistles(14:26; 15:26) and the things to come (Rev.\n\n1:19).\n\nSecond, Jesus teaches clearly in John 16:13 that the Holy Spirit will guide\n\nYOU into all the truth. The word \"You\" in Greek is not singular but plural.\n\nThis is important because it was not just one Apostle, like the Apostle Peter,\n\nbut all the Apostles would be led into all the truth. The entire church would\n\nbe led by the Holy Spirit into all the truth.\n\nThis is the first error of the Protestants. And this error can be traced all\n\nthe way back to the first Protestants, the Roman Catholics. They are the first\n\nto deny this central teaching of the scripture and the children of the Roman\n\nCatholics, the Protestants, follow the same errors to this day. The Roman\n\nCatholics wanted the church to read this verse with a singular \"you\" rather\n\nthan a plural \"you\". The Pope in Rome promoted this teaching and he wanted all\n\nchurches to believe that only He alone was guided by the Holy Spirit into all\n\nthe truth. And even today the most recent Catechism of the Roman Catholics\n\nteaches that the Pope infallible in virtue of His office. The bishops are\n\ninfallible only, if they agree with the Roman Pontiff.\n\nThe Protestants basically make the word \"you\" apply to every person who reads\n\nthe Bible. Protestants makes every person a pope through the doctrine of Sola\n\nScriptura. This happens every time when a person's interpretation of the Bible\n\ntakes precedence over the entire church's understanding of the Bible.\n\nEvery person among the Protestants is also a pope in recognizing which books\n\nbelong in the Bible. Martin Luther questioned whether James or Revelation\n\nshould be excluded from the Bible. And today modern Protestants want to add\n\nthe gospels of Thomas or other Gnostic Gospels to the Bible. This is another\n\nreason why this verse( John 16:13) must apply to the entire church. The New\n\nTestament writers wrote the scripture but they gave no list of the books of the\n\nBible. Who would infallibly recognize which books belong in the scripture? It\n\nwas the church, who remembered the Apostles oral preaching, held fast to the\n\nwritten gospels and rejected the false gospels in the Apostle's name. Only the\n\nHoly Spirit would guide them into ALL the truth.\n\nHistorically, it might take some time to lead all the church into all the\n\ntruth, but it is clear the ecumenical councils are ecumenical because the\n\nentire church receive these councils through the enlightenment of the Holy\n\nSpirit. They receive these councils because they recognize the Holy Spirit\n\nguided the entire church into ALL the truth. The Nicene Creed, which was\n\nwritten at these councils, proclaims the truth which the entire church believed.\n\nThe only way the church could change the Nicene Creed would be if the entire\n\nchurch was moved to change it. And yet, it was the first Protestants who\n\nchange the creed without the rest of the church. This change caused a split\n\nand the Roman Church was born in error because they reject the teaching of\n\nScripture that the entire church would be lead into all the truth and not just\n\none individual. They took it upon themselves to change how the church should\n\ndetermine dogma and changed the Nicene Creed. This change has inspired the\n\nchildren of the Roman Catholics, the Protestants, to change the faith whenever\n\nthey disagree with the church. Thus, today some Protestant churches encourages\n\ngay marriages, fornication and host of other sins like abortion, etc.\n\nThis is the essence of Protestantism, a denial that the Holy Spirit has lead\n\nthe church into all the truth. The True Church calls for all \"churches\" and\n\nChristians to return to the teaching of scripture and return to the Holy\n\nOrthodox Church by submitting to the seven ecumenical Councils in doctrine and\n\npolity. It is the only way of health for the church and her Salvation. Come\n\nto the narrow way that leads to life.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the people of God kept genealogical records to remember\n\nthe faithfulness of God. God promised to be God to them and to their children.\n\nGod promised the Old Testament People of God that he would lead them into the\n\ntruth. Those who believed remembered what their fore father's believed, by\n\nkeeping genealogical records of those who passed down the faith to them. Mere\n\nfleshly genealogical records were not enough. This is seen in the case of\n\nIsaac and Ishmael. Both were physical descendants of Abraham, but only Isaac\n\nbelieved, Ishmael did not continue in the faith. Thus, Isaac is remember in\n\nthe genealogical record concerning the faith, Ishmael is not.\n\nThe New Testament people of God are also to remember those who taught them the\n\nfaith, by keeping genealogical records of faith. The Apostle Paul writes,\n\n\"Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word\n\nof God: whose faith follow\" ( Heb:13:7) \"Hold fast the form of sound words,\n\nwhich thou hast heard of me ...\" (2 Tm:1:13)\n\nThis faith is to be passed down to other faithful men who will kept the same\n\nfaith, who will teach other faithful men.\n\nThe Apostle taught, \"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many\n\nwitnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach\n\nothers also.\" (2 Tim 2:2) Thus, the faith is to be a chain which links one man\n\nto another all the way back to the Apostles.\n\nIf a church, can not show their genealogical succession of faithful men\n\npassing down the faith from one generation to the next, then we should not\n\ndoubt the claim of the church as being Apostolic? For how can we know what\n\nthey believed is truly what the Apostles believed? For no one can show the\n\nfaith they hold has been passed down faithfully through a record of the pastors\n\nof their church.\n\nFurthermore, if the church can not show their faith has been passed down by\n\nfaithful men back to the Apostles, is this not a denial of the teaching of John\n\n16:13? That the Holy Spirit will lead the entire church, from the time of the\n\nApostles, to the present day, into all the Truth.\n\nOnly the Orthodox church can show through Apostolic succession the faith which\n\nApostles held is the same faith today, for we believe the church has, and will\n\nbe lead into all the truth. We believe the teaching of Jesus, especially John\n\n16:13. Come and join the Orthodox church who has been led into all the truth."
