        "text": "By Aaron Earls\n\nEurope birthed Protestantism. North America helped spread it around the world. But the future of Protestant Christianity appears to be in Africa and Asia.\n\nToday, 41 percent of all Protestants live in Africa, according to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. By 2050, that number is expected to swell to 53 percent.\n\nOut of 560 million Protestants, more than 228 million call Africa home in 2017. That’s more than 2.5 times as many as Europe and almost 4 times as many as North America.\n\nAsia has the second highest Protestant population with almost 100 million.\n\nIn 1910, the 10 nations with the largest population of Protestants were all in Europe or former British colonies such as the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nOnly three of those nations—the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany—remained on the list in 2015. African nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia jumped onto the list, along with Brazil and the Asian countries of China, India, and Indonesia.\n\nOf the 10 nations with the fastest Protestant growth rate from 1910-2015, seven are African, including the top five.\n\nRwanda 13.01%\n\nBurundi 12.62%\n\nCôte d’Ivoire 12.44%\n\nBurkina Faso 12.32%\n\nChad 11.98%\n\nVietnam 11.85%\n\nCentral African Republic 11.38%\n\nRepublic of Congo 10.85%\n\nPhilippines 10.82%\n\nNepal 10.22%\n\nMore recently, however, Asian countries have experienced significant growth. Among the 10 nations with the fastest Protestant growth rate from 2005-2015, five are Asian and four are African.\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe 11.50%\n\nBhutan 10.21%\n\nNiger 7.14%\n\nSingapore 5.66%\n\nIran 5.51%\n\nBenin 5.40%\n\nAzerbaijan 5.31%\n\nSenegal 5.13%\n\nHonduras 5.13%\n\nLaos 5.07%\n\nAARON EARLS (@WardrobeDoor) is online editor of Facts & Trends."
