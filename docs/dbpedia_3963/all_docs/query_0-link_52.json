        "text": "In this paper the author tries to show that the introduction of Roman Catholicism to the Philippines has effected two fundamental influences, viz., Westernization (in terms of Hispanization and later Americanization), which enables the native Filipinos to see and gradually adopt a different culture, and syncretism, where the sacred and the profane are blended, that is to say, the Filipino indigenous rituals and practices are made compatible to Catholicism. The author likewise tries to argue that folk Catholicism is in general the Filipino way of expressing religion as a way of life. \"\n\nThis paper argues for the appreciation of Filipino folk religiosity as part of cultivating authentic faith expressions among Filipinos. It presents historical, anthropological, sociocultural, and theological views on significant folk religious groups, traditions, and practices in the Philippines, including but not limited to the millenarian movements and popular Catholic feasts. Despite the varied influences and variegated Philippine culture, folk religiosity among Filipinos can be generalized as a syncretic blending of pre-colonial beliefs with the Catholic faith. As an academic and practicing Catholic, the researcher explores the folk religious elements present in the development of the millenarian movements, the unique faith expressions and influences behind folk Catholic feasts and celebrations, and probes deeper into the meaning of ordinary faith expressions. Coming from his own experiences and insights, he refers to previous scholarly works in discussing how spirituality or reverence to the sacred is inherently embedded in the folk religious ways, how the cultural Filipino traits manifest in the religious practices and vice versa, and how folk spirituality enables the expression of deep cultural and personal Christian faith experience. In conclusion, he maintains that millenarian movements are valid faith expressions that also celebrate independence and Filipino identity; traditional festivals and religious rites are the locals’ unique way of authentically expressing their faith, and; preserving folk religions and folk religiosity among Catholics is beneficial for engendering the growth of the faithful and the development of religion. A clear sense of folk religiosity is elemental in reappropriating religious dogmas and doctrines as the church and the faithful continuously study, dialogue, and fully experience life in the pursuit of approaching authenticity in faith, beliefs, and religions.\n\nThe early Filipinos had a traditional religion before the Spanish expedition reached the Philippines in the fifteenth century. They have their own set of cultural traditions, beliefs, and practiced a religious system. But the question on why and how did the majority of Filipinos have come to accept the Catholic religion as an alternative to their indigenous religious beliefs is a question asked by many historians and anthropologists. This paper contributes to the discussion on how Christianity developed in the Philippines by drawing out similar constructs between the indigenous religion of the early Filipinos and Christianity. The paper concludes that the lack of tension between the traditional religion of the early Filipinos and Catholicism allowed Christianity to prosper and dominate in the Philippines.\n\n“Polarized Enemies. Christian-Muslim Dichotomy in the Early Modern Philippines,” in: Jos Gommans and Ariel Lopez (eds.), Philippine Confluence. Iberian, Chinese and Islamic Currents, c. 1500-1800, Global Connections: Routes and Roots 1 (Leiden, Leiden University Press 2020) (ISBN: 9789087283391), pp. 257-285. // Abstract: Christian-Muslim cohabitation in the Philippines was almost never peaceful. This was already evident to the Spanish chroniclers of the early modern period as well as to historians of the nineteenth century. The latter in particular characterized the history of the Philippines as a continuous confrontation between Muslim “Moros” and Catholic Spaniards, which they called guerras piráticas, “pirate wars.” By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, Spain was winning this Moro Wars, owing to the modernization of Spanish warfare, especially the utilization of steamships. The war changed over time, as did the Spanish discourse. It is the purpose of this present chapter to investigate how the Moros and the Moro Wars were described by Spaniards between the late sixteenth and the early nineteenth centuries. By focusing on specific moments in Philippine history, it will examine the ways in which the two enemies were juxtaposed and contrasted with each other and the resulting discursive dualism and polarization. It is outside the scope of this work to look for any linear development from one status of discourse to another; rather, the article follows the different forms of discourse, the polarizations, the peculiarities, and the reiteration of topoi over time.\n\nThis chapter offers new ways of critically assessing the vibrancy of Christianity in the Philippines. The premise is that it is diverse. While it is important to discuss the fortunes of Catholicism, the dominant religion, it is also crucial for new analyses to factor in the emergence of new religious groups. In other words, the analytical way forward is to frame the discussion in terms of Christianities in the Philippines. To spell out their salient attributes is the aim of this chapter. In the latter part consideration will be given to how Roman Catholicism fares in relation to this diversity. The first point is that Christianity in the Philippines is militant. In the literature, Militant Christianity refers to fundamentalism and its triumphalist disposition toward different spheres of society. These facets have some local resonances. Although many new groups and denominations have emerged over the years, their general theological character is fundamentalist, which spills over into their political choices. In this sense, the religious economy, while competitive, also has a predictable and dominant trait. The second characteristic is that it is global. The global expansion of many groups has been made possible by the movement of Filipinos to work around the world. But explaining it only in this manner is no longer adequate. I will argue that the global character of Filipino Christianity is a result too of a postcolonial assertion. Many religious leaders are convinced that Filipinos have a calling to evangelize the world. The chapter ends by situating Roman Catholicism in relation to these developments. While other Christian groups are asserting themselves in militant and global ways, there are indications that Roman Catholicism’s influence in the public sphere is waning.\n\nI try to present a uniquely Filipino approach to Catholicism between kagandahang-loób and sákop, a tug between hospitality and reduction, as an attempt of a critical phenomenology of religion. To be a Filipino is less of a static concept and more of becoming an event. The Spanish colonial conquest marked by the faith’s arrival in 1521 baptized this mobile identity as Filipino, which continued throughout history. The experience of being a Filipino thus has become an admixture that we today recognize: citizen and migrant, Asian and Western, welcoming and elitist. The cynicality of this Filipino identity is due, I argue, to our adoration of reduction: the denied independent experience of flourishing as a race to the tight embrace of the salvific promise of carrying the cross. Through this reduction, historically manifest in the Reducción, we have learned to condense our experience and ultimately to claim that hospitality is our virtue expressed as kagandanhang-/kabutihang-loób. Yet, the sheer goodness of the will is not enough to articulate the Filipino Faith, evident in the strong push against the inculturated Misa ng Sambayanang Filipino and the faith’s obvious absence in Philippine politics. A critical phenomenology of religion ought to allow one to confront the political imports of religious experience both as cause and effect. Thus, if there is any unique understanding of Catholicism’s Filipino appropriation, it is found in the search for experience within this reduction, located between the virtue of kagandahang-loób and our concept of sákop."
