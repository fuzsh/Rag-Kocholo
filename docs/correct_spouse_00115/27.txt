A lawsuit against Britney Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline, over an overdue $15,000 school tuition balance, has been dropped.

The Los Angeles-area private school West Valley Christian School put in legal papers to drop their civil suit against Federline, 45, this past Wednesday, according to Page Six.

Lawyer Ron Chow, who is representing the prep school, filed paperwork in Los Angeles Superior Court to have the case dismissed, according to the outlet.

In the legal process, the court dismissed the case 'with prejudice' - which restricts the school from filing a suit over the sum in the future - and a non-jury trial slated for the future has been dropped.

Federline is father to six children: daughter Kori, 21, and son Kaleb, 19, from his relationship to former fiancée Shar Jackson, 46; sons Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden, 16, from his marriage to Spears, 41; and daughters Jordan, 12, and Peyton, nine, with his wife, Victoria Prince, 40.

Federline was wed to Spears in October of 2004, and Spears filed for divorce in November of 2006. He exchanged vows with current wife Prince in August of 2013, with the couple celebrating their 10-year anniversary this month.

It was not made clear in documents reviewed by the outlet if the Fresno, California native and his spouse had paid any of the $15,593 toward the balance for their daughters Jordan and Peyton.

In its initial legal filing May 9, the school said that the couple had failed 'to pay for services which had been provided on credit at their special instance and request.'

The school said in legal docs that it had attempted to avoid going to court to collect the balance, but Federline and Prince 'failed and refused … to pay all or any part of the remaining balance due.'

Federline and Prince relocated to Hawaii earlier this month with their kids, with Spears giving the move her support.

News of Federline's legal ongoings comes less than a week after Spears' spouse of 14 months, Sam Asghari, 29, filed divorce papers Wednesday in Los Angeles County court, listing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.

Asghari has asked for Spears to pay spousal support and his legal team in the parting, noting that the couple - who wed at her Thousand Oaks, California mansion on June 9, 2022 - had separated July 28.

'No negative intention has ever been directed towards [Spears] and never will be,' Asghari’s rep Brandon Cohen said Thursday, according to the AP. 'Sam has always and will always support her.'

Federline last week issued a statement through lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan amid news that Spears and Asghari were divorcing following more than a year of marriage.

'He wishes them both the best,' Kaplan told ET. 'If they reconcile, great, but hopefully it won't be a factor that makes her feel more alienated than she might otherwise be if she was still in an intact marriage.'

Federline 'wishes her the best and hopes that things work out for her for the best,' his lawyer said.
