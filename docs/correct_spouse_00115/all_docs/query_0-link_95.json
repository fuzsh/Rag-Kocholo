        "text": "Britney Spears’ most famous ex, Kevin Federline, just got married in Vegas to his girlfriend of five years, teacher Victoria Prince.\n\nOne of the witnesses: Their 1-year-old girl.\n\nUS Weekly broke the news K-Fed would both propose and marry Prince here this weekend. The wedding went down at about 8 p.m. Saturday at the Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, Britney is rehearsing to perform regularly at Planet Hollywood soon. The biggest question left unanswered: Why isn’t a rival hotel launching a show called “Britney’s Exes” starring K-Fed and other winners?\n\nI would rather see that show. Hotels: I challenge thee.\n\nSIGHTING, EXPANDED\n\nGeorge Takei and his husband Brad Altman dined Saturday at Eiffel Tower Restaurant.\n\nThey were here for the “Star Trek” convention at the Rio (where the old “Star Trek” bar and attraction should reopen, after the Hilton stupidly closed them years ago).\n\nI interviewed Takei and Altman at the “Star Trek” convention five years ago, when they had been together for 21 years. They were lovely. And Takei told me my favorite “Star Trek” insider minutiae. He said William Shatner was charming but purposely wouldn’t pronounce “Takei” correctly, just to get at him.\n\n“I’ve been working with Bill Shatner yay these 40-plus years,” Takei told me. “He never seems to get it right.”\n\nTakei tried telling Shatner his name rhymes with “way” and even “gay.” But Shatner wouldn’t budge.\n\nSo finally, Takei dropped the Shatner hair bomb.\n\n“I told him, ‘It’s Takei — rhymes with “toupee.’ ” I thought that would do it,” Takei told me and then let out his famous laugh.\n\nShatner continued to mispronounce his name.\n\nOVERHEARD\n\nTerry Farrell, who played Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax on “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,” told “Star Trek” conventioneers at the Rio this weekend she had a crush on Shatner when she was a kid, then added:\n\n“I just saw Bill. And I hugged him. And I wrapped my leg around him.”\n\nVEGAS IMPACTS IBIZA\n\nPete Tong, the British DJ and influential BBC Radio 1 star, says the Vegas nightclub scene is having an impact on Ibiza, Spain.\n\nIbiza has been the world’s capital of electronic dance music for a decade. But Vegas has been giving Ibiza a run for its money for the past few years. This summer, some big DJs didn’t even play Ibiza for the first time in forever. And Ibiza superstar club Pacha has dropped some DJs who demanded bigger fees.\n\nBut Vegas doesn’t mind paying those huge DJ fees, which can range from $25,000 to $500,000 per night, depending on the size of the star. Anyway, Tong gave an interview to the Bang Showbiz network (no, I have never heard of Bang either) and he sent a warning to peers: “If DJs are overcharging, then ultimately the wheels will fall off.”\n\nPeople either won’t go or clubs won’t be able to book them.\n\n“If you’re overcharging and not delivering, then Ibiza — before anyone else in the world — will find you out, because it has so much choice every single night of the week.”\n\nActually, Vegas will find out first. I have heard some DJs are underperforming crowd capacity. If you think clubs will keep paying them going rates, you’re crazy.\n\nDoug Elfman’s column appears Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. He also writes for Neon on Fridays.
