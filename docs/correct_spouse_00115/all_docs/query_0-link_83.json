        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSinger Britney Spears has responded after her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, stated that their children didn’t want anything to do with her. Slamming Federline for interfering in her and her children’s relationship, Spears has described his statement as hurtful.\n\nA couple of days ago, Kevin Federline, the ex-husband of Britney Spears, said that their two sons didn’t want anything to do with the singer. Reacting to this claim, Britney Spears posted her statement on her Instagram account.\n\nShe wrote that she is saddened to see her ex-husband discussing her and her children’s relationship on social media. She added that raising teenage boys is a challenging task, and Federline’s claims have hurt her. Federline made the comments after Spears posted revealing photos of her on her Instagram account.\n\nFederline said that the photos might be Spears’ way of expressing herself. However, such photos harm their children. He said he couldn’t imagine how the children handled such photos being teenagers and having to attend high school. Federline added that their sons loved their mother. However, the whole episode with Spears has been hard to watch and harder to live through for the boys.\n\nHe said that it was difficult and described it as being the most challenging thing that he had ever done in his life. Kevin’s post went viral and prompted a response from both Spears and her new hubby Sam Asghari.\n\nThe couple disputed Federline’s statements on social media. In his Instagram post, Asghari came to the defense of Britney. He wrote that Federline’s statement had no validity, and he shouldn’t write such things publicly. Asghari said that the boys were still young, and once they reach 18, they would be in a better position to make their own decisions. Then the boys would see the folly of having a father, who hasn’t worked much in over 15 years as their role model. Asghari added that he didn’t know Federline personally. However, Federline’s character has been revealed by his support for the cruel 13-year conservatorship of Spears.\n\nMoreover, Federline’s loyalty towards Jaimie also shows that he supported the conservatorship even when it was conceived.\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari tied the knot in June. Earlier, Spears was married to Kevin Federline, with whom she shares two sons, Jayden James and Sean Preston, aged 15 years and 16 years, respectively. After their divorce, Federline received sole custody of the children in 2007. Reportedly, Federline receives five figures monthly payment for child support.\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
