        "text": "Oops, she did it again … she dropped another bombshell.\n\nBritney Spears revealed in her bombshell-riddled memoir that she had no idea that that her ex-husband Kevin Federline was expecting a child with another woman when they began dating in 2004.\n\n“Kevin had a ‘bad boy’ image. Still, I had no idea when we met that he had a toddler, nor that his ex-girlfriend was eight months pregnant with his second baby,” Spears, 41, wrote in “The Woman In Me,” which hit bookstores on Tuesday.\n\n“I was clueless. I was living in a bubble, and I didn’t have a lot of good, close friends to confide in and get advice from. I had no idea until after we’d been together for a while and someone told me, ‘You know he has a new baby, right?’ ”\n\nSpears, who was fresh out of her tumultuous relationship with former heartthrob Justin Timberlake, later confronted Federline, now 45, who admitted the truth.\n\n” ‘You have kids?’ I said. ‘You have children? Not only one child but two children,’ ” Spears recalled yelling at the former rapper.\n\nFederline was previously engaged to actress and singer Shar Jackson, and welcomed their daughter, Kori, in 2002.\n\nThe “Moesha” star gave birth to their son, Kaleb, shortly after Federline left her for the “Womanizer” songstress in 2004.\n\nJackson, now 47, later alleged that she and Federline were still together when he left her for Spears, but the pair are reportedly on better terms now.\n\nOne year after the scandal, Spears would later marry Federline and have two kids of her own with him – sons Sean Preston and Jayden. They’d later split in 2007.\n\nThe Post reached out to Federline for comment.\n\nIn her memoir, Spears went on to detail battling postpartum depression amid the exes’ nasty custody battle.\n\n“Kevin tried to convince everyone that I was completely out of control,” the Grammy winner claimed. “He started to say I shouldn’t have my kids anymore — at all.”\n\n“My management team quit. A bodyguard went to court with [attorney] Gloria Allred by his side as a witness in the custody case,” Spears continued, adding that the bodyguard told the court Spears was doing drugs but was not cross-examined.\n\n“A court-appointed parenting coach said that I loved my children and that we were clearly bonded,” she claimed. “[It] never made it into the headlines.”\n\nThe court battle ended with Federline retaining sole custody of their children.\n\nIn 2008, Spear was placed involuntarily into a conservatorship by a judge, but was able to regain some parenting rights of her children."
