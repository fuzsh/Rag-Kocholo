        "text": "Britney Spears says she is saddened by “hurtful” claims made by her ex-husband Kevin Federline.\n\nFederline’s comments about his ex-wife and her relationship with their sons went viral Saturday. Federline said: “The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now. It’s been a few months since they’ve seen her. They made the decision not to go to her wedding.”\n\nFederline and Spears share two sons: Sean, 16, and Jayden, 15.\n\nFederline, 44, a former dancer, later added, “This whole thing has been hard to watch, harder to live through, harder to watch my boys go through than anything else.”\n\nHe also alleged that part of the fallout had to do with her Instagram account.\n\n“It’s been tough,” he said. “It’s the most challenging thing I’ve ever had to do in my life.”\n\nSpears responded late Saturday on her Instagram story.\n\n“It saddens me to hear that my ex-husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children,” wrote Spears, 40. “As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone ... It concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram ... it was LONG before Instagram ... I gave them everything. Only one word: HURTFUL ... I’ll say it ... My mother told me ‘You should GIVE them to their dad.’ I’m sharing this because I can. Have a good day folks!!!”\n\nSpears’ husband, Sam Asghari, 28, also shared his thoughts about the matter, saying on his Instagram story: “There is not validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly. The boys are very smart and will be 18 soon to make their own decisions and may eventually realize the ‘tough’ part was having a father who hasn’t worked much in over 15 years as a role model.”\n\n“Kevin’s gravy train will end soon which probably explains the timing of these hurtful statements,” he added. “I do not know him personally and have nothing against him aside him chosing to vilify my wife. His character is revealed by approval of the cruel 13 year [conservatorship] and his loyalty to Jaimie indicates his approval at time of its conception as well.”\n\nJamie Spears is Spears’ father.\n\nJayden and Sean did not attend Spears’ wedding in June. At the time, Federline’s attorney said in a statement: “Although the boys will not be in attendance, Kevin and the boys are happy for Britney and wish her and Sam all the best going forward.”\n\nSpears rarely shares photos of her children, but she did post a snap of her and the boys standing in the middle of a field in March 2021."
