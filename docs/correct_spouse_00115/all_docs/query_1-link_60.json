        "text": "Britney Spears has dominated headlines with her explosive memoir, 'The Woman in Me', dropping one bombshell after another about her private life – but her latest revelation hasn't gone down well with one of her ex-husbands.\n\nThe 41-year-old singer has written about all her marriages, including her shotgun wedding to childhood friend, Jason Alexander. The duo married in Las Vegas in 2002 when Britney was 22 years old, but their union was short-lived as it was annulled 55 hours later.\n\nIn her tell-all book, Britney made the shocking revelation that she only exchanged vows with Jason because she was \"very drunk\" and \"very bored\".\n\n\"As a twentysomething will do after a few drinks, I wound up in bed with one of my friends — a childhood friend who I've known forever,\" she wrote. The third night we were together, he and I got [expletive]—faced.\n\n\"I don't even remember that night at all, but from what I've pieced together, he and I lounged around the hotel room and stayed up late watching movies — Mona Lisa Smile and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Then had the brilliant idea of going to A Little White Chapel at three thirty in the morning. When we got there, another couple was getting married, so we had to wait. Yes – we waited in line to get married.\n\n\"People have asked me if I loved him. To be clear: he and I were not in love. I was just honestly very drunk — and probably in a more general sense at the time in my life, very bored.\"\n\nJason has since denied Britney's recollection of the evening, telling TMZ that they were in love and were sober when they tied the knot. He also shared their wedding photo on Instagram and sarcastically wrote: \"Yeah Britney and I just hate each other and we don't remember anything and we weren't sober here.\"\n\nHe also added several rolling-on-the-floor laughing emojis and the hashtags: \"#whateversells #sellouts #greed #losers.\"\n\nFollowing their whirlwind wedding, which Britney described as \"innocent fun\", she went on to marry Kevin Federline in October 2002. The former couple welcomed sons Sean, now 18, and Jayden, now 17, before splitting in 2007.\n\nIn 2022, the 'Overprotected' singer tied the knot with Sam Asghari, but after one year of marriage, he filed for divorce, listing their separation as July 28, 2023.\n\nThe wedding took place at her $7.4 million home in Thousand Oaks, California, and pictures revealed the home had been transformed for the special day, with white sofas with pink cushions and a dance floor covered in pink and purple lights that matched the floral displays.\n\nThe pop star wore a bold wedding dress from Donatella Versace on the big day, with the look featuring off-the-shoulder straps and a thigh-high leg split, which she teamed with a simple white veil with satin edging.\n\nParis Hilton, Drew Barrymore, Madonna, Selena Gomez, and others were all in attendance at the wedding, although her two sons did not attend, neither did her parents or sister Jamie-Lynn. Britney and Sam began dating after meeting in 2016 on the set of her music video for 'Slumber Party'."
