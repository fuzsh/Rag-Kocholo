        "text": "Britney Spears' ex Kevin Federline married his long-term girlfriend Victoria Prince in Las Vegas on the weekend.The 35-year-old surprised Victoria when the pair were on holiday, romantically getting down on one knee to say: \"Victoria Prince, will you marry me in two days, in front of 30 of our closest family and friends?\" according to E! News.\n\nThe happy pair were granted a Nevada marriage license for Clark County on Friday night, reported People.com, and on Saturday, the pair married in an intimate ceremony at The Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nWhile the impromptu nuptials came to the bride and many of the guests as a surprise, Kevin's Vegas wedding was a far cry from his ex-wife Britney's.In 2004, Britney famously wed her hometown friend, Jason Alexander, after a drunken night out.The marriage was briefly lived, being annulled 55 hours later on the grounds that the Toxic singer \"lacked understanding of her actions,\" at the time.\n\nIn comparison, Kevin and Victoria's wedding was attended by their two-year-old daughter, Jordan Kay, who took on the role of flower girl.\n\nThe bride wore a classic white, strapless bridal gown designed by Maggie Sottero for her big day, while former backup dancer Kevin donned a Jean Yves suit.\n\nKevin met Victoria in 2008 when they both played on the same bowling team, the Party Animals.\n\nBefore that, he was married to pop star Britney for two years. The couple have two sons together, Sean Preston, seven, and Jayden, six.\n\nDespite a bitter divorce and custody battle, in which Kevin won full custody, the pair seem to have reached a middle ground and now have an amicable relationship."
