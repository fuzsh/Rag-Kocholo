        "text": "Kevin Federline is probably best known for being the ex-husband of Britney Spears but he is also the father of six children with three different mothers, which is no mean feat.\n\nThe 44-year-old DJ and former backup dancer has shown that he enjoys having kids around, though they are now growing up quickly into teenagers and adults.\n\nIt all began with him back in July 2002, when Kevin became a father for the first time.\n\nAt the time, Kevin was in a relationship with US sitcom Moesha star, Shar Jackson and they welcomed a daughter, Kori.\n\nThe couple went on to have another together, a son Kaleb, but by the time he arrived in 2004, their relationship was over and Kevin had already hooked up with Britney.\n\nSpeaking about the split at the time, Shar said: \"It wasn’t just breaking up a relationship … [but] breaking up a family.”\n\nKevin apologised for this during his time on Celebrity Fit Club in 2010, when he said to Shar: \"I know I’ve caused you a lot of pain. I’ve been really selfish.\n\n\"I guess I got so wrapped up in all this other s**t that I never really got a chance to sit back and apologise to you.\n\n\"I really do want you to know that I am sorry.”\n\nShar was blunt with her reply, saying: \"I felt like the whole relationship was not real by the way you handled it ending — and that killed me.”\n\nKevin went on to marry Britney in October 2004 but three years later his divorce from the 'Princess of Pop' had been finalised.\n\nThere was time though for the couple to welcome two sons, Sean Preston and Jayden in September 2005 and 2006 respectively.\n\nAfter the high profile relationship with Britney, Kevin has had a pretty quiet, out of the spotlight coupling with Victoria Prince.\n\nThey met in 2008 and eventually married in 2013 in Las Vegas.\n\nTwo years before tying the knot, Kevin and Victoria welcomed their daughter Jordan. Peyton then followed in 2014.\n\nKevin has been speaking out this week about his son's Sean Preston and Jayden's relationship with their mum Britney and admitted that he hasn't encouraged the teenagers to see the singer much any more.\n\nHe said about Britney's recent nearly naked posts on Instagram : \"I try to explain to them, 'Look, maybe that's just another way she tries to express herself'.\n\n\"But that doesn't take away from the fact of what it does to them. It's tough. I can't imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.\"\n\nHe continued: \"This whole thing has been hard to watch, harder to live through, harder to watch my boys go through than anything else. It's been tough. It's the most challenging thing I've ever had to do in my life.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us at webcelebs@mirror.co.uk or call us direct 0207 29 33033."
