        "text": "The world seemed to take a collective breath when Britney Spears, now 41, and her husband, Sam Asghari, now 29, tied the knot in an intimate wedding ceremony last year. While Britney's conservatorship had been at the center of her life for 13 years, the personal trainer and model remained a \"rock-solid\" part of her life. So, fans were thrilled to cheer on their beloved pop star as she found her happily-ever-after with Sam. But now, it looks like the couple could be calling it quits, multiple sources have confirmed to People. And a source also told ET that Sam has already filed for divorce.\n\n\"Britney and Sam have split. She's adamant she didn't cheat,\" a source told ET. \"The two haven't got along for a while and it finally came to an end after a major blowup.\"\n\nBritney and Sam's reps have not commented or confirmed the information, but a source told ET that Brit \"has not been doing well.\"\n\nBrit's marriage to Sam marked her third wedding and second marriage. She was previously married to Jason Alexander in 2004 in Las Vegas for just 55 hours, and then married Kevin Federline that same year. Fourteen months ago, Britney walked down the aisle in a Donatella Versace dress, and had the time of her life on the dance floor with Madonna and several other famous guests. Now, it seems that fairytale may be over.\n\nIf you still have some big questions about the Princess of Pop's hubby (and possibly soon-to-be ex), you're not alone. Here's everything you need to know about Britney's husband, Sam Asghari and their life together:\n\nThere have been rumors about a possible split.\n\nRumors that the couple was struggling began in March of 2023 after both were spotted without their wedding rings, but Sam's reps quickly shut those rumors down, saying he took off his ring to film a new movie.\n\nHe signed an \"ironclad\" prenup.\n\nBefore tying the knot, the pop star, who is worth $70 million, made her hubby-to-be sign an intense prenuptial agreement. In fact, the agreement said that Britney will keep all of the money she earned prior to the couple's marriage (which, is quite a bit of it), according to Page Six. Sam would also be allotted about $1 million for every two years of marriage, per US Weekly, but since they're just over a year into their marriage, Sam probably won't get that money.\n\nHowever, Sam is now apparently trying \"to negotiate concessions beyond his prenup,\" according to Page Six, even threatened to release \"extraordinarily embarrassing information\" about her if his demands aren't met.\n\nSam is from Iran.\n\nSam, 29, was born in Tehran, Iran, and he lived there with his family until he was 12. Then, he moved to Los Angeles to be with his father, per Page Six. “I had to leave my friends and family who I was very close with,” he told Men’s Health. “And I knew I was moving away and never coming back.”\n\nHe was an athlete in college and is super fit.\n\nSure, he's a personal trainer but…wowzer. The man clearly does not mess in the fitness department. He played football in college. “I was a very masculine guy—I played football and was in the police academy,” he told Men’s Health. He played in high school, then at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln before getting cut from the team and switching to Moorpark College in L.A.\n\nThere’s that time he shared a photo of his super-ripped legs:\n\nAnd then that pic of himself topless in jeans:\n\nAnd who can forget the photo series of Sam casually showing off his guns?\n\nHe's also a model.\n\nSam didn’t have modeling dreams initially, but he says his sister encouraged him to try it. “At the time, my Sunday best was basketball shorts,” he told Men’s Health. “My sister said, ‘I will take you to this audition, just come with me.’”\n\nFrom there, he has walked in runways, appeared in Super Bowl ads, and even starred in Fifth Harmony’s “Work From Home” music video as well as one of Britney's.\n\nBritney and Sam met on the set of her music video for \"Slumber Party.\"\n\nAfter starring in Fifth Harmony’s \"Work from Home\" video, his agent scored him a spot on Britney's \"Slumber Party\" in October 2016. \"I was excited that I get [sic] to meet one of the biggest artists of all time,\" he told Men's Health about the job. \"I had butterflies.\"\n\nSam says he cracked jokes to Britney on set, pretending he didn’t know her name. According to People, he gave Britney his number, and finally, five months later she reached out. “I was like, ‘He was a really cute, this guy was really cute,’ so I called him,” Britney said in a radio interview. “He’s just a really fun, funny person.”\n\nAfterward, they went out to get sushi together—and soon enough, the paps caught onto their relationship, snapping photos of the good-looking pair.\n\nThey became IG official on New Year's Day 2017.\n\nDespite photogs following the couple everywhere for months, the duo didn’t make their relationship social media official until 2017 by posting a simple photo of themselves together. (Though, apparently, Sam had previously posted a photo and then deleted it. Maybe they agreed on a better time to share the news?)\n\nAfter that, though, the two gushed about each other all the time, using phrases like “better half” and “princess” and posting endearing messages on each others' accounts. They’ve also shared photos together from all around the world—from Malibu to Japan.\n\nBritney and Sam have a 13-year age difference.\n\nDespite their age difference, \"Sam has a lot more in common with Britney [than her past boyfriends],\" a source told Us Weekly in February 2018. \"He's very fun.\"\n\nSam has also told ET how much his family adores Britney: “We've been together for three years and my sisters love her, my family loves her. My mom lives in another country [but] when she was here, she met her.”\n\nHe clearly adored Britney—and vice-versa.\n\nIn September of 2020, Britney decided to swap out her signature blonde hair for a darker look. The singer captioned the photo, \"Same faces, same dress, new hair !!!!! 👠 Yes, my sister inspired me to go dark!!!!!!!\"\n\nSam hopped into the comment section writing, \"Beautiful blond or black ❤️.\" But this isn't the first the couple has expressed their love for one another on the 'gram. It seems like they’ve got a lot of mutual admiration for each other.\n\n“I’ve been with this man for over a year... everyday he inspires me to be a better person and that makes me feel like the luckiest girl in the world,” Britney wrote in an Instagram caption.\n\n“She motivates me more than anyone,\" he told Men's Health. \"It’s crazy how I can be humbled by a person like her. If I could be that humble when I’m that high in life, that would be the best thing. She is another blessing that happened to me.”\n\nThey are regular workout buddies.\n\nIt's no wonder that, with a trainer for a husband, Britney has been all about fitness in recent years. According to Asghari's interview with Men's Health, the couple used to work out together all. the. time. Just check out the killer partner moves above and sweet dance moves below:\n\n\"The exercises, I come up with them, but the videos are because of my better half,\" Asghari told Men's Health. \"She’s the video director.\"\n\nHe was a huge support during Britney's conservatorship case.\n\nIn 2019, a source told Us Weekly that Britney's relationship with Sam was \"rock solid,\" and that he had tried to \"keep her level-headed and calm\" amidst drama with her conservatorship.\n\n\"She has spent the last year prioritizing herself and her well-being, something she did not have a chance to do as much during her Las Vegas residency. She has had less time with her sons but got really close with her mom, Lynne, and sister, Jamie Lynn, again recently. Britney spends most of her time at home with her boyfriend, Sam [Asghari], or alone,\" the source added. \"...He brings her so much joy and is a source of stability in her often chaotic life.\"\n\nFollowing the release of the New York Times documentary Framing Britney Spears (out now on Hulu) and her new statements in the highly publicized conservatorship hearing, he spoke out about looking forward to a \"normal\" future together.\n\n\"I have always wanted nothing but the best for my better half, and will continue to support her following her dreams and creating the future she wants and deserves,\" Sam told People. \"I am thankful for all of the love and support she is receiving from her fans all over the world, and I am looking forward to a normal, amazing future together.\"\n\nSam Asghari / Instagram Stories\n\nHe also wore a #FreeBritney shirt and shared his unfiltered opinion on the conservatorship battle in Instagram Story posts.\n\n\"Now it's important for people to understand that I have no respect for someone trying to control our relationship and constantly throwing obstacles our way. In my opinion, Jamie [Spears] is a total dick,\" he wrote. \"I won't be going into details because I've always respected our privacy but at the same time I didn't come to this country to not be able to express my opinion and freedom.\"\n\nThe pair's engagement was years in the making.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Sam answered, \"Absolutely,\" when asked whether he saw marriage in his future with the \"Make Me\" singer. \"This is something that every couple should do. That's the whole point of a relationship—we are a family,\" he said. (Ummm, how cute is that?)\n\n\"Trust me, if we do ever get married, everybody’s going to know,\" he continued. \"Actually, you might be the first one to know—you never know!\"\n\nBritney agreed and shared her wedding bell hopes in her court statement alongside heartbreaking revelations. \"I want to be able to get married and have a baby.\"\n\nSam proposed with a \"one-of-a-kind ring.\"\n\nIn September of 2021, Sam proposed to Britney with a ring designed by New York City-based jeweler Roman Malayev. According to E! News, the ring features a four-carat, round-cut diamond. It's also engraved with the word \"Lioness,\" which is Ashgari's nickname for Britney.\n\n\"Every designer I spoke with about the ring was amazing with great ideas, but I just clicked with Roman—we really connected on the design and he was as excited as I was to make it special—that's why I chose him,\" Sam said in a statement.\n\nIn an Instagram video, Britney confirmed to her fiancé that she's over the moon about her new sparkler:\n\n\"I can’t fucking believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!,\" the pop star captioned the clip. Ashgari also posted his own cute pic of the moment, with an up-close look at Britney's new bling. \"🤴👸 @britneyspears,\" his short (but sweet!) comment read.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was intimate, with 50 close friends and family members.\n\nBritney and Sam got married at her house in Los Angeles, and only invited 50 friends and family, a source told Page Six.\n\nThe couple did not extend an invite to Britney’s parents, Jamie and Lynne, nor her sister, Jamie Lynn (so, anyone with the name Jamie or Lynn), to the affair. Her sons, Sean Preston, 16, and Jayden James, 15, which she shares with Federline were not in attendance, per Page Six. However, her brother, Bryan, was present, according to TMZ.\n\nEarlier that day, Britney posted a video of Sam and herself on her Instagram story. They were riding in a Rolls Royce while Brit holds a glass of champagne and flaunts her bedazzled French manicure. And her dress? Apparently designed by Donatella Versace, of course.\n\nThe guest list was star-studded.\n\nThe ceremony was officiated by Reverend Clint Hufft, who also officiated Paris Hilton’s wedding in 2021, and had some very special guests.\n\nBritney walked herself down the aisle to “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley, PEOPLE reported. Taking place at 8:30 p.m. PT, according to Us Weekly, the wedding lasted around three hours, during which Britney changed her outfit three times.\n\nAs far as a guest list goes, this was the party that I wish I could’ve attended. Madonna, Drew Barrymore, Paris Hilton, and Kathy Hilton, were all in attendance, per PEOPLE. \"It ended up being the happiest night for Britney,” a source told PEOPLE. “She wanted a fairytale wedding and she got it.”\n\nBritney’s ex-husband, Jason Alexander, crashed the wedding.\n\nAlexander showed up at her house to stop the wedding, per Us Weekly. And he streamed the whole thing on Instagram Live.\n\nAccording to the videos from TMZ, he ran into the house after speaking to a security guard before going back outside, where he was restrained. Upon showing up at the house, he claimed Britney had “invited” him. “She’s my first wife. My only wife,” he said during the livestream.\n\nAlexander was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors: trespassing and refusing to leave the property, battery, and vandalism, according to legal records seen by Us Weekly. His bail was set at $22,500. In August of 2022, he was found guilty of the criminal charges, reported. Alexander pleaded no contest to aggravated trespassing and battery, according to the Ventura County District Attorney's Office, and prosecutors dropped the felony stalking and misdemeanor vandalism charges.\n\nThe couple moved into a new home together.\n\nIn an Instagram posted shortly after her wedding, Britney shared a glimpse into the beautiful new abode that she shares with her new hubby.\n\n“Got married and moved into a new house around the same time,” Brit said in the caption. “It’s so weird I wake up and everything is new … new pool … new kitchen … new bed … I think I’m in shock,” the Hit Me Baby One More Time singer wrote. “Change is so great.\""
