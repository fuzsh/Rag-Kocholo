        "text": "There's a potential reconciliation between American singer Britney Spears and her sons with her ex-husband Kevin Federline.\n\nAccording to a report by Entertainment Tonight, Federline's attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, said that the international superstar's children, Sean Preston and Jayden James, are hoping to talk to their mom soon.\n\n\"Reconciliations and the reunification of relationships are difficult and take time. They are sometimes complicated and always a lengthy process. The process has not really commenced, let alone [been] completed,\" Kaplan told ET.\n\n\"The good thing is that the boys saw their mom was doing well and have a desire to speak with her,\" he said.\n\n\"There has been some telephonic communication between Britney and her sons, and we think that is a step in the right direction,\" the attorney continued.\n\nThis came after a source told ET that the Baby One More Time singer \"wants to prioritize taking care of herself and reestablish a relationship with her family, including her kids.\"\n\n\"This is a top priority of hers and she would love to heal things and get to a place where things can be healthy and consistent,\" an insider told the entertainment portal.\n\nFederline revealed in 2022 that their sons have been \"avoiding\" Spears for months. According to him, they were upset over Spears' claim that he refused to meet with her when she was pregnant with one of their kids. \"The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now. It's been a few months since they've seen her,\" he said at the time.\n\nJayden, the singer's youngest son, previously said he's hoping to fix his relationship with his mom but noted that their reconciliation would take \"a lot of time and effort.\"\n\n\"I 100% think this can be fixed of course,\" he told ITV News. \"It's just going to take a lot of time and effort... I really want to see her again.\"\n\nSpears and Federline got married in 2004. They got divorced in July 2007 and had several different custody arrangements with their sons."
