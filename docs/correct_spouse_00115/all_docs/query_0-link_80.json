        "text": "After Britney Spears Accused Her Sons Of Being “Hateful” Because Her Child Support Is Almost Over, Kevin Federline Is Moving Them To Hawaii, Where She May Have To Pay Until They’re 23 Years Old\n\nIn Hawaii, child support is ordered for children up to 23 years old, as long as they are in full-time education.\n\nBritney Spears’s complicated relationship with her sons has been well documented over the years, with the star sharing 16-year-old Jayden and 17-year-old Preston with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline.\n\nThe two separated in 2007, and one year later, Kevin was granted sole custody of the boys when Britney was placed under a controversial conservatorship.\n\nUnder the terms of the legal agreement, Britney received two visits and one overnight per week. She also provided Kevin with $20,000 a month in child support, which covered their sons’ school, insurance, and clothing expenses.\n\nIn 2018, Kevin demanded an increase in the monthly payments, and an agreement was reached later that year, although details of it have not been publicly confirmed.\n\nWhile Britney’s conservatorship was terminated in November 2021, her relationship with Jayden and Preston has remained strained. Last year, Kevin told the Daily Mail that the boys had been choosing not to see their mom for months and also opted not to attend her wedding to Sam Asghari.\n\nJayden later spoke out in an interview with ITV News, where he said that he and Preston need to “heal” their “mental state” and “process all the emotional trauma” they’d been through.\n\nHe said of their mom, “I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better, I really want to see her again.”\n\nJayden went on to accuse Britney of posting nude photos to Instagram “to get some attention” and said that “she should come to the realization whatever it is that stops her loving her family.”\n\nBritney responded to this interview on social media, where she suggested that Jayden and Preston were only being “hateful” because her child support payments were due to stop in a couple of years, once they turned 18.\n\n“So, Jayden, as you undermine my behavior just like my whole family always has with, ‘I hope she gets better, I will pray for her,’” Britney said in the now-deleted audio clip. “Pray for what? I keep working so I can pay off Mom’s legal fees and her house? Do you guys want me to continue to get better so I can continue giving your dad 40 grand a month?”\n\nShe went on, “Or is the reason you guys have decided to be hateful is that it’s actually over in two years and you don’t get anything?”\n\nBut despite the obvious tension between Britney and her sons, she regularly speaks out about how much she loves and misses them. In May, the star opened up about her private life in a now-deleted Instagram post, where she wrote, “I miss my children desperately and think of them everyday.”\n\nIt was later revealed that Kevin had reached out to Britney earlier that month to ask for permission to move Jayden and Preston to Hawaii. On Wednesday, it was confirmed via her lawyer Mathew Rosengart that Britney had approved the move.\n\nKevin’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told People magazine that the move is “an opportunity for Kevin and his wife — and the boys are ready to get away from the LA microscope.”\n\nKevin’s wife, Victoria Prince, is also said to have had a job offer from a Hawaiian university, and Kevin believes that there are additional professional opportunities for himself in the state.\n\nBut Britney’s supporters have now accused Kevin of having ulterior motives after picking up on Hawaii’s extended child support laws.\n\nIt has been noted that Hawaii is the only state where child support is ordered for children up to 23 years old, so long as they are enrolled in full-time education at a college or university, a vocational school, or a trade school.\n\nPreston will turn 18 on Sept. 14, and while the relocation to Hawaii is due to happen once he has graduated from high school, any plans for further education remain unclear. Meanwhile, Jayden turns 17 on Sept. 12 and will “continue taking classes remotely” after the move.\n\nRetweeting a news article about the situation, one person wrote, “He’s doing this because the courts can force her to pay child support up to the age of 23 in Hawaii.”\n\nTwitter: @ohnomissvio\n\n“Kevin desperately wanting to move to Hawaii is definitely child support related,” another agreed.\n\nTwitter: @earth22_on\n\nOne more said in response to a news article, “Child support cutoff in Hawaii is 23. They aren’t fucking slick at all.”\n\nTwitter: @TylerColeRay\n\nAnother tweet read, “there's a loophole in hawaii where you have to pay child support until the kid is 23 (so long as they're attending school).... he's exploiting her for money.”\n\nTwitter: @bean3r93\n\nSomeone else was suspicious of the timing of the move for another reason, noting that it comes amid the news that Kevin is being sued by his other children’s private school for owing over $15,000 in tuition.\n\n“Kevin Federline gets sued for not paying for the education of his kids and then decides to move to Hawaii where he can apply to get child support until Britney's boys are 23,” they wrote. “It is painfully obvious Britney is still trapped and will be as long as so many people depend on her $$$.”\n\nTwitter: @laswannegra\n\nBuzzFeed has contacted Kevin’s rep for comment.\n\nShare This Article"
