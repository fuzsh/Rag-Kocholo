        "text": "Pop star Britney Spears’ relationship with her ex-husband Kevin Federline has been strained for years. While they parent their two sons together, Jayden and Sean Preston, Federline has been rather apt to give his opinion on Britney’s mental state, her Instagram, and the termination of her 13-year conservatorship.\n\nLast year, Federline gave a whopper of an interview to ITV news where he made sexist comments about Britney’s Instagram posts, and also suggested that they were the reason why their sons didn’t want to visit their mother anymore. He then posted and swiftly deleted videos to his social media, allegedly showing Britney yelling at her sons, without giving context for the argument.\n\nNow, oddly enough, the two are on the same side, saying that a recent report from The Daily Mail was not only “false” but “repulsive.”\n\nOn June 11, the “Toxic” singer posted to her official Instagram that not only is the report not true, it’s sad. “\"The fact that people are claiming things that are not true is so sad.This may not even be them saying such things because it doesn't make any sense to me for them to be saying that.\"\n\nShe then addresses her sons directly in her caption, writing, “It makes me sad because I tried so hard to make things nice for you and it was never good enough. So you guys go behind my back and talk about me...it breaks my heart and the news is so low.\"\n\nShe adds, “l've always felt like the news bullies me … It's sad because everyone sits back as if that's ok to make up lies to that extent ... Why am I told I have to sit back and rise above ??? When they all go so low ??? Hopefully it is just the news being hateful and Kevin nor Preston said any of those things.”\n\nHer revulsion stems from an interview both Federline and their son Sean Preston gave to The Daily Mail, which the boys say twisted their words and manipulated the situation. Federline reportedly told journalist Daphne Barak that he fears his ex-wife and mother of his children is a meth user. \"I fear she's on meth — I've been praying someone would make it public and that she wakes up. ... It's terrifying. She is the mother of my boys,\" the outlet reported.\n\n“Every time the telephone rings, I fear that there will be devastating news. I don't want the boys to wake up one morning and find their mother has taken an overdose,” he reportedly continued.\n\nNow, Federline has taken to his Instagram Stories to allege that this is a fabricated lie.\"It saddens our family that Daphne Barak and Erbil Gunasti have decided to fabricate lies and publish the heartache our family has endured, along with the trauma of our minor children in the Daily Mail and The Sun,\" he posted. \"We did allow Daphne & Bill into our home because we trusted them, but that trust was lost and we severed ties back in March for many reasons we choose not to go into here.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It is very distressing that she continues to harass our family when we have repeatedly asked her to leave us alone. As was previously published, our family did speak with Ms. Barak and Mr. Gunasti a few times, and this was done in a respectful way with love & compassion for Britney and the Spears family. Her lies and attempts to exploit minors is clickbait and another repulsive example of where, unfortunately, certain journalism has sunk today.\"\n\nThis is a rare sign of solidarity between Federline and Britney who have had an acrimonious relationship due to the custody of their sons, her conservatorship, and her father Jamie’s interference. In 2019, Federline filed a restraining order against Jamie Spears after an alleged altercation between him and Sean Preston. Then in 2022, he gave an interview stating the opposite, saying Jamie brought “order” to her life, saying, “He saved her life.” Britney has accused her father previously of “conservator abuse.”\n\nNow it seems Britney’s attorney Matthew Rosengart has also weighed in on the allegations. Speaking with TMZ, he stated, “Kevin Federline himself has now acknowledged the falsity of the story, asserting that it contains 'fabrications' and 'lies' about Britney. In addition to exploiting and making false claims about Britney, particularly regarding 'crystal meth,' the 'story' also exploits her minor children, which is beyond the pale.\"\n\nHe continues, \"This writer also repeatedly sought to contact Britney under false pretenses, using her children as bait, which is outrageous. This was poor and shoddy 'journalism' even in today's era of clickbait journalism.\"\n\nNeither journalist Daphne Barak nor The Daily Mail have commented on the scandal as of press time."
