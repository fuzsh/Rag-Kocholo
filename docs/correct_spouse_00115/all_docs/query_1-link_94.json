        "text": "Sam Asghari, the husband of pop star Britney Spears, has filed for divorce after 14 months of marriage, according to numerous reports.\n\nRumours of the couple’s allegedly tumultuous relationship have circulated online since they wed in June 2022. The Associated Press reported Asghari, 29, filed for divorce on Wednesday.\n\nIn his filing, Asghari cited “irreconcilable differences” as reason for the divorce, according to NBC News. He is reportedly seeking spousal support from Spears, 41, and has requested she pay his legal fees.\n\n“Petitioner has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party,” the filing reads. “Petitioner reserves the right to amend this Petition or to conform the Petition to proof.”\n\nTMZ was the first outlet to break the story of the couple’s the separation.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAfter news of the couple’s divorce broke on Thursday, Asghari posted a statement to social media.\n\n“After 6 years of love and commitment to each other, my wife and I have decided to end our journey together,” he wrote on his Instagram story. “We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S—t happens. Asking for privacy seems [ridiculous] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.”\n\nSpears has not yet commented publicly.\n\nSpears first met Asghari, a model and actor, when he was featured in her 2016 Slumber Party music video.\n\nAsghari reportedly supported Spears throughout the dramatic and highly publicized end of her over 13-year-long conservatorship.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe conservatorship was held by Spears’ father Jamie Spears, and allowed him to make medical, financial and personal decisions on the star’s behalf. Outrage over the conservatorship swelled amid the #FreeBritney movement, which saw the singer’s fans demand the legal arrangement be terminated.\n\nEven Asghari and Spears were seen sporting #FreeBritney T-shirts as the court proceedings came to an end.\n\nTrending Now\n\nMexico visa-free travel a ‘bilateral irritant’ for Canada-U.S. relations\n\nTrump vs. Harris? Here’s what recent polls say about the potential match-up\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAbout six months after her conservatorship was dissolved, Spears and Asghari married in a star-studded ceremony at the Toxic singer’s California home. Drew Barrymore, Paris Hilton, Madonna and Selena Gomez were in attendance.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CerbzbzOJK-/\n\nSince news of Asghari’s divorce filing surfaced, Spears has been active online but has not made any mention of her love life. Instead, Spears told her Instagram followers on Tuesday that she plans to buy a horse.\n\n“Buying a horse soon !!! So many options it’s kinda hard !!!” the pop star wrote in an emoji-filled caption.\n\nAsghari is Spears’ third husband.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Oops!…I Did It Again singer was infamously married to her childhood friend Jason Alexander for only 55 hours before filing for divorce in 2004.\n\nLater that year, she married Kevin Federline, with whom she has two teenage sons. Spears and Federline divorced in 2007. Her conservatorship began the following year in 2008 after several months of her strange behaviour in public."
