        "text": "Britney Spears’s husband of a little over a year, Sam Asghari, has filed for divorce. On Wednesday, TMZ’s “sources with direct knowledge” told the outlet that Asghari confronted Spears “about a week ago” about rumors that she “stepped out” on him, and it spurred a fight, which in turn spurred his moving out. The source added, “It’s only a matter of time before Sam files for divorce.”\n\nSeveral hours later on Wednesday, Entertainment Tonight confirmed Asghari had filed the paperwork. According TMZ, he cited “irreconcilable differences,” and is asking for Spears to pay spousal support and attorneys fees. The outlet also reports that he listed the date of separation as July 28, 2023. Spears has reportedly hired Hollywood’s go-to divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, who previously helped her fight for custody of her sons amid her split from ex-husband Kevin Federline.\n\nOn Thursday, Asghari responded to the breaking news, posting to his stories the following missive:\n\nAFTER 6 YEARS OF LOVE AND COMMITMENT TO EACH OTHER MY WIFE AND I HAVE DECIDED TO END OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. WE WILL HOLD ONTO THE LOVE AND RESPECT WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER AND I WISH HER THE BEST ALWAYS SHIT HAPPENS. ASKING FOR PRIVACY SEEMS REDICULOUS [sic] SO I WILL JUST ASK FOR EVERYONE ... TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL.\n\nThe former couple have a prenup, according to TMZ, one that protects Spears’s assets up to the day they were married. However, Page Six reports that Asghari has threatened to release “extraordinarily embarrassing” info on the performer if their prenup is not renegotiated. Asghari’s representative Brandon Cohen of BAC Talent denied these claims in a statement to People.\n\n“All these claims are false, as no negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be,” he said. “Sam has always and will always support her.”\n\nThe same day the news broke, Spears posted on Instagram a message about a horse. “Buying a horse soon!!!,” reads the caption. It continues:\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSpears and Asghari met in October 2016 on the set of her music video shoot for “Slumber Party,” in which he played the mysterious love interest with a big scar. They didn’t immediately get together, but reconnected after five months, and announced their relationship on Instagram on New Year’s Day 2017.\n\nFor the majority of their time together, Spears’s father Jamie Spears controlled her financial and physical life through the conservatorship she’d been placed under in 2008. In September 2021, right before Spears was officially released from the conservatorship, Asghari proposed. He had a custom ring designed by Roman Malayev, and he had it engraved with his nickname for Spears, “Lioness.”\n\nThe pair were married in June of last year in a backyard ceremony at Spears’s mansion in Thousand Oaks, California. Selena Gomez, Madonna, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore, and Donatella Versace attended (Versace made Spears’s dress too). It was fairy-tale-themed, complete with horse-drawn carriages.\n\nSpeculation has been circling for months that the fairy tale was coming to an end. In late July, Asghari’s mother was involved in an accident and hospitalized, and he logged off social after posting that he had to “prioritize what truly matters.” The tabloid media made a big deal of the fact that he wasn’t wearing his wedding ring in the photo with his mother.\n\nIn the past, Asghari frequently defended Spears publicly. He’s issued a strongly worded statement about her ex-husband Kevin Federline’s claims that Spears’s two sons didn’t wish to see her, and another when TMZ released TMZ Investigates: Britney Spears: The Price of Freedom, a documentary on the performer.\n\n“Ninety-nine percent of the time those are all clickbait [stories] for you to click and for them to make money, and that time is over,” he said in a since-deleted video posted in May. “I found it absolutely disgusting for the people who were in her life when she didn’t have a voice, they went and told her story like it was theirs. How are you going to take the most influential person of her generation, the Princess of Pop, America’s sweetheart, and put her in prison where her father [Jamie Spears] tells her what to do, what water to drink, who to see and use her as a money-making machine?”\n\nAshgari continued, “All of a sudden—after 15 years when she’s free after all those gaslighting, all those things that went down—now you’re going to put her under a microscope and tell her story? No, no, that’s also disgusting, so don’t do that, and don’t believe what you read online.”\n\nSpears’s own story, her memoir The Woman in Me, is due out in October. Though the publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, has not shared what ground it’ll cover, the book presumably will include her relationship with Asghari. But it would have been shipped awhile ago, so whatever information lies therein could be old news.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect a comment from Sam Asghari and his representation."
