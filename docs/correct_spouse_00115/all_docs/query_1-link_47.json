        "text": "Britney Spears’ long-awaited memoir The Woman in Me has finally hit shelves, with the pop princess shedding light into her life in her own words for the first time.\n\nIn January 2004, a then-22-year-old Spears made headlines when she married Jason Alexander in a shotgun Las Vegas wedding — only the annul the marriage 55 hours later. In her book, the “Piece of Me” singer reflected on the story behind her short-lived marriage to her childhood friend. “As a twentysomething will do after a few drinks, I wound up in bed with one of my friends — a childhood friend who I’ve known forever,” she explained. “The third night we were together, he and I got s—faced. I don’t even remember that night at all, but from what I’ve pieced together, he and I lounged around the hotel room and stayed up late watching movies — Mona Lisa Smile and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre – then had the brilliant idea of going to A Little White Chapel at three thirty in the morning. When we got there, another couple was getting married, so we had to wait. Yes – we waited in line to get married.”\n\nShe continued, “People have asked me if I loved him. To be clear: he and I were not in love. I was just honestly very drunk — and probably in a more general sense at the time in my life, very bored.”\n\nThe singer added that for her family, the surprise wedding was “like I’d started World War III,” even though, for her, the whole thing was nothing more than “innocent fun.” After her wedding to Alexander, Spears went on to marry Kevin Federline in October that year. The couple welcomed sons Sean and Jayden before splitting in 2007.\n\nIn 2022, Spears married Sam Asghari — with Alexander crashing her wedding by breaking into her home hours before the ceremony. In August 2023, Alexander took a plea deal to avoid felony charges, pleading no contest to misdemeanor counts of aggravated trespassing and battery, according to Ventura County prosecutors. Due to the incident, Spears won a restraining order against Alexander June, and the plea agreement came with a criminal protective order prohibiting Alexander from coming within 100 yards of her or the security guard he battered."
