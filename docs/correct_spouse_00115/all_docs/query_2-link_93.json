        "text": "Britney Spears didn't purposely start dating her ex-husband Kevin Federline while he was simultaneously welcoming his second child.\n\nIn the Princess of Pop's memoir, The Woman in Me, which released on Tuesday, October 24, Spears insisted she didn't find out the former backup dancer was a father until after their relationship began.\n\n“Kevin had a 'bad boy' image. Still, I had no idea when we met that he had a toddler, nor that his ex-girlfriend was eight months pregnant with his second baby,\" the 41-year-old confessed of Federline, 45, who was engaged to Shar Jackson prior to sparking a romance with Spears in 2004.\n\nFederline and Jackson, 47, welcomed their daughter, Kori, in 2002. The Moesha actress gave birth to their son, Kaleb, very shortly after Spears started dating the failed rapper.\n\n\"I was clueless. I was living in a bubble, and I didn’t have a lot of good, close friends to confide in and get advice from. I had no idea until after we’d been together for a while and someone told me, 'You know he has a new baby, right?'\" Spears detailed in her tell-all memoir.\n\nAfter finding out the shocking information, the \"Toxic\" singer proceeded to confront Federline about being a father-of-two.\n\nSpears and Federline went on to welcome their sons, Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden James, 16, before divorcing in 2007.\n\nAfter welcoming her two children, Spears battled a difficult case of postpartum depression, though instead of comforting her, Federline decided to claim she wasn't mentally fit to be a mother.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for!\n\n\"Kevin tried to convince everyone that I was completely out of control,\" Spears confessed in the bombshell book. \"He started to say I shouldn’t have my kids anymore — at all.\"\n\nIn 2008, Spears lost custody of her sons after she was placed under two involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations. Shortly after the start of her conservatorship that same year, however, she regained joint custody of her children.\n\nThey currently live in Hawaii with Federline, his wife, Victoria Prince, 40, and their two daughters, Jordan, 12, and Peyton, 9.\n\nRegardless of the state of their relationship, Spears wrote her \"boys\" are still \"the love[s] of [her] life,\" as she dedicated her emotion-filled memoir to them."
