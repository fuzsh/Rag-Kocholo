        "text": "\"From when they were six to nine years old, I had them 70% of the time, and of course, since they've been gone I've honestly felt like a huge part of me has died,\" she said in one of the clips. \"Like, literally, have no purpose anymore. They were my joy. They were my everything. I looked forward to seeing them. That was what I lived for and then all of sudden they were gone and I was like, 'Did my heart just stop beating?'\"\n\nSpears is currently in a feud with her ex-husband and her sons after they began to speak publicly about her relationship with them.\n\nIn August, Federline told the Daily Mail that the boys \"have decided they are not seeing her right now.\"\n\nSpears has since responded with a series of now-deleted Instagram posts in which she said the decision was \"pretty harsh\" and called her sons \"hateful.\"\n\nFederline responded by sharing three since-deleted videos on Instagram of Spears appearing to argue with her two sons when they were younger.\n\nIn her audio clip on Saturday, Spears commented: \"Honestly, I don't understand how it's so easy for them to cut me off like that.\"\n\nThe singer added in a later clip that she doesn't want her boys to visit until she \"feels valued.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nEarlier this month, Spears' youngest son, Jayden, told ITV News that his relationship with his mom \"100%\" could be \"fixed.\"\n\n\"It's just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally,\" he continued. \"When she gets better I really want to see her again.\""
