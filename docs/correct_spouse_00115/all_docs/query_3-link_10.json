        "text": "Much more than curb appeal, the purchase of this Los Angeles home comes with some serious celebrity wedding history.\n\nLocated at 4053 Farmdale Ave. in the affluent Colfax Meadows neighborhood of Studio City, this five-bedroom property — which recently listed for $3.19 million — is where Britney Spears and Kevin Federline tied the knot in a surprise ceremony on Sept. 18, 2004, The Post has learned.\n\nSpears and Federline didn’t reside there. Instead, their wedding planner, Alyson Fox, called it home.\n\nSpears and Federline had planned a lavish October affair at the Bacara resort in Santa Barbara, but quickly changed plans when the date and location were leaked to the press. In an effort to avoid paparazzi attention, Fox helped the now-former pair organize surprise “I dos” that took place in front of her living room’s bay window.\n\n“The vendors made the house look stunning,” Fox told Time in 2014, reflecting on the 10-year anniversary of the event. “It was so beautiful.”\n\nTo this day, the home remains a stunner. At 3,898 square feet, features include oak floors, formal living and dining rooms — plus a just-renovated kitchen with a walk-in pantry and a breakfast area. Listing images show a wide entryway, an office with a coffered ceiling and, elsewhere, fireplaces. It’s also described in its listing as “an entertainer’s delight,” which rings true when considering its past.\n\nGuests at the wedding that day — including Spears’ now-estranged immediate family members: dad Jamie, mom Lynne, brother Bryan and sister Jamie Lynn Spears — had no idea they’d be witnessing nuptials.\n\nThe couple — whose divorce was ultimately finalized in 2007 — told guests they were merely celebrating their summer engagement; Spears proposed to Federline during a June 2004 plane ride amid her Onyx Hotel Tour.\n\n“I only wish they could have had more people … Every person who walked in that night, we handed them an invitation, they opened it up and it said, ‘Surprise! You are here for the wedding and not the engagement party,’ ” Fox added. “And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos…”\n\nFox didn’t respond to The Post’s request for comment by press time. Property records show that Jeff Fox, who appears to be her husband, purchased the home for $335,000 in 1993 — or about $696,000 in today’s dollars. Both Jeff and Alyson’s names appear in a 2006 deed when they sold the spread for $2.08 million, or $3.11 million today. Redfin shows the residence has traded hands three times since 2006, most recently selling in May 2017 for $2.2 million, or $2.66 million in today’s figures.\n\nThe Agency, which represents the listing, declined to comment on the wedding. Listing agent Ingrid Sacerio, through a brokerage spokesperson, highlighted its features mentioned in the marketing materials. “4053 Farmdale … is a timeless traditional exuding style and sophistication thanks in great part to esteemed architect, Richard Olander. The home boasts … inviting interiors with the finest finishes and an enchanting garden perfect for entertaining guests,” she said.\n\nIn the finale of Spears and Federline’s UPN reality series “Chaotic,” they explained why they ultimately exchanged vows at the home.\n\n“She wanted it to be more for me and her than the whole world … we toned it down within, like, two weeks. We cut it down to, like, 30 guests,” Federline said.\n\nSpears added, “I was like, ‘Let’s just do something really small and quick and fun.’ ”\n\nTo keep their forthcoming marriage tightly under wraps, Monique Lhullier associates thought they were coming over to Fox’s house for a final wedding dress fitting, florists were told they were arriving for a photo shoot — and the cake vendor was under the impression Spears and Federline were having an at-home tasting.\n\n“It was cool,” Spears said. “I didn’t even know what her house looked like. I was just trusting everything and then I walked in and I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s perfect.”\n\nThe home was covered in white drapery, thousands of roses and countless candles. The backyard was tented, illuminated by trees full of twinkle lights.\n\n“It was really cool because you wouldn’t think in such a small environment that someone could do something that beautiful,” Spears said. “It was really, really sweet and very nice.”"
