        "text": "Britney Spearsâ€™ ex-husband Kevin Federline has spoken out about the singerâ€™s conservatorship and the custody of their children following the controversial documentary about her life, Framing Britney Spears.\n\nThe Drive Me Crazy singer was married to Kevin for three years until 2007 and they share two sons; Sean, 15, and Jayden, 14.\n\nIn 2019, it was agreed that Kevin, 42, would have 70% custody of the boys leaving Britney with 30%.\n\nSpeaking on Kevinâ€™s behalf, his family lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan told E! News that the children are â€˜doing great and Kevin is enjoying watching them grow up and evolveâ€™.\n\nKaplan added: â€˜Kevin enjoys the full extent of the custody that he has. Both parties are working well in exchanging custody.â€™\n\nThe lawyer said that he has â€˜no idea whether the kids are aware of the documentaryâ€™, which aired in the US last weekend and explored in-depth the singerâ€™s controversial conservatorship.\n\nIn 2008, Britneyâ€™s father Jamie Spears was awarded conservatorship of her person and financial assets following her mental health breakdown.\n\nThe documentary looked at a Britneyâ€™s legal attempts to remove Jamie from the conservatorship, in order to regain control of her own life.\n\nHowever, Kevin is keeping his thoughts on the conservatorship to himself as Kaplan stated: â€˜Kevin has no involvement with regard to Britney and her attorneys asking to remove Jamie as conservator. He has stayed out of the conservatorship issues.\n\nâ€˜He thinks Jodi Montgomery has done an admirable job and he has no other position to state with regard to the conservatorship.â€™\n\nMontgomery temporarily replaced Jamie as conservator in September 2019 in light of his health problems. Last November, a judge ruled that Jamie would remain as co-conservator of Britneyâ€™s person along with the Bessemer Trust Company as conservator of her estate.\n\nThe Hulu documentary has led to widespread reaction from fans and celebrities joining the #FreeBritney movement.\n\nThe Slave 4 U singerâ€™s boyfriend Sam Asghari also hit out at Jamie in an Instagram post yesterday, claiming he has tried to â€˜controlâ€™ their relationship.\n\nBritney, 39, appeared to address the documentary last night and wrote in a social media caption: â€˜I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person â€¦.. I love simply enjoying the basics of every day life !!!!\n\nâ€˜Each person has their story and their take on other peopleâ€™s stories !!!! We all have so many different bright beautiful lives ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¼!!! Remember, no matter what we think we know about a personâ€™s life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens.â€™\n\nGot a showbiz story?\n\nIf youâ€™ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Britney Spears addresses conservatorship drama: â€˜Each person has their storyâ€™"
