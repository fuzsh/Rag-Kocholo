        "text": "FOLLOWING her annulment from Jason Alexander, Britney Spears tied the knot with her backup dancer Kevin Federline.\n\nBefore she divorced her second husband, the Hold Me Closer singer welcomed two children with him.\n\nWhat is Kevin Federline doing now?\n\nKevin Federline works as a DJ and resides with his second wife Victoria Prince in Hawaii.\n\nK-Fed and Victoria have two daughters named Jordan and Peyton.\n\nIn addition to K-Fed's daughters, his and Britney's sons Sean Preston and Jayden also live with him in the abovementioned state.\n\nPreviously, the former reality star used to reside in Los Angeles.\n\nThe move was brought on by Victoria's job opportunity at the University of Hawaii and K-Fed's additional DJing opportunities.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, it was announced Britney approved of her boys relocating with their father.\n\nWhat is K-Fed and Britney's custody arrangement?\n\nOn August 28, 2019, K-Fed and Britney reached a custody arrangement where the former retains 70 percent of the custodial rights of Sean Preston and Jayden and the latter retains 30 percent.\n\nFollowing Britney's wedding to her third ex-husband Sam Asghari, it was revealed Sean and Jayden did not attend their mother's nuptials.\n\n\"The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now,\" K-Fed told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It's been a few months since they've seen her. They made the decision not to go to her wedding.\n\n\"This whole thing has been hard to watch, harder to live through, harder to watch my boys go through than anything else.\n\n\"It's been tough. It's the most challenging thing I've ever had to do in my life.\"\n\nJayden also mentioned to the above-mentioned outlet: \"I think Mom has struggled giving us both attention and showing us equal love and I don’t think she showed enough to Preston and I feel really bad for that.\n\n\"We’ve both been through so much pressure in the past that this is our safe place now, to process all the emotional trauma we’ve been through to heal, heal our mental state.\n\n\"If I complained, she went after [my brother]. I feel guilty, so I am there for him. Mom has treated me better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Britney responded to K-Fed and their sons via Instagram: \"I helped your father who hasn’t had a job in 15 years.\n\n\"I assume it is easier for you guys not to have someone check on you to make sure you’re doing your homework.\n\n\"I’m sure...your dad smoking weed every day benefits your daily life at 15 and 16 to partake in a VERY COOL GENERATION.\n\n\"Since they’ve been gone, I’ve honestly felt like a huge part of me has died.\n\n\"Like, literally, I have no purpose anymore. They were my joy, they were my everything.\n\n\"I looked forward to seeing them. That was what I lived for.\"\n\nThe Scream and Shout singer tells more of her side of the story in her memoir The Woman in Me; which is everywhere on October 24, 2023.\n\nWhen did Kevin marry his second wife Victoria?\n\nOn August 10, 2013, K-Fed tied the knot with Victoria Prince.\n\nTheir wedding ceremony took place at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Vic is my best friend,\" the dancer-turned-DJ told Us Weekly.\n\n\"We work well together. We both want the same things for our children.\n\n\"Me and Vic know how to have fun together and I think that’s important.\"\n\nWhile reflecting on his marriage to Britney, the father-of-six recalled: \"There were ups and downs. We’re not perfect people, obviously.\n\n\"I really thought I'd spend the rest of my life with her. The truth is, I loved her to death.\n\n\"I really learned a lot about what I like in a person from her, a lot.\""
